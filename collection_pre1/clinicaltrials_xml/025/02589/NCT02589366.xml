	<brief_summary>Part standard treatment endometrial cancer remove one group lymph node ( lymph node dissection ) . Lymph node small , bean-shaped organ locate within body throughout lymphatic system ( tissue organ involve immunity , aid fight infection cancer ) . The purpose study compare safety ability Lymphoseek Vital Blue Dye ( trace agent ) find lymph node may carry cancer tumor lymphatic system . Lymphoseek injected tumor day surgery remove lymph node . Vital Blue Dye administer surgery trace cancer well . The surgeon remove lymph node part routine surgery keep track lymph node identify Lymphoseek Vital Blue Dye . These node send another doctor view microscope see node contain cancer cell . The hypothesis Lymphoseek use safely least effective blue dye identify lymph node may cancer cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This open-label , single center , intra-patient safety comparison study Lymphoseek ( Technetium Tc 99m Tilmanocept ) vital blue dye detection lymph node patient endometrial cancer undergo lymph node dissection part standard medical care . The day surgery , patient tumor injected 50 µg Lymphoseek radiolabeled 75 megabecquerel ( MBq ) Tc 99m . Vital sign monitor thirty minute patient undergo whole body scan single photon emission compute tomography/ x-ray compute tomography ( SPECT/CT ) one two hour Lymphoseek injection . Fourteen twenty hour injection Lymphoseek , patient physical exam clinical laboratory test assess prior undergoing surgery . Sentinel lymph node identification begin injection Vital Blue Dye . Surgical access make lymphatic basin node expect . Sentinel lymph node identify hand-held gamma counter and/or blue appearance . The threshold criterion positive `` hot '' node base radioactivity count great quantity 3 square root mean background count ( i.e. , standard deviation ) add mean background count ( refer `` 3σ rule '' ) . Once lymph node identify , vivo count take prior excision . In vivo count consist set three 1-second count lymph node . A positive finding ( i.e. , localization ) designate `` hot '' node ( describe ) . Any lymph node count meeting threshold criterion consider negative ( non-localized ) finding . To confirm vivo procedure , set three 1-second count record excised lymph node . The count ex vivo lymph node compare room background count , threshold criterion use determine positive finding vivo node apply ex vivo specimen . A thorough evaluation remain lymphatic basin complete select node count negative use threshold criterion . The surgeon continue visualization palpation accord local practice ensure grossly positive lymph node remain site resection . After identify sentinel lymph node , standard lymph node dissection perform . All remove lymph node send pathology evaluation . All remove lymph node send pathology confirm radioactive status ( due Lymphoseek ) blue appearance ( due vital blue dye . The pathological evaluation lymph node ( ) include serial section H &amp; E stain well immuno-histochemistry ( IHC ) stain accord institutional practice . Patients return routine post-operative follow-up visit 7-14 day surgery assessment adverse event . The primary objective safety Lymphoseek measure incidence adverse event , change laboratory value , vital sign physical exam finding , radiation absorb dose . Secondary evaluation include ( 1 ) number lymph node detect `` hot '' preoperative imaging ( whole body scan SPECT/CT ) intraoperative gamma detection , ( 2 ) rate concordance Lymphoseek Vital Blue Dye vivo detection excise lymph node .</detailed_description>
