	<brief_title>Effects Shoulder Pain Simulated Hyper-gravity During Rehabilitation Exercises</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Standard rehabilitation protocol use every subject , depend cause shoulder pain . The treat clinician determine appropriate therapy protocol subject . During treatment session , subject wear comfortable waist belt attach rubber band anchor point ground ( rubber band tighten simulate extra-gravity ) . Upon enrollment , treat clinician randomly assign subject one four group depend type load exercise typology . The hyper-gravity simulate additional 50 % subject 's body weight . The frequency duration therapy session determine treat clinician ( usually 45 minute therapy twice week 4 week ) . Before , 24h post therapy session , subject grade pain level use numeric pain scale ( 0 pain ; 10 unbearable pain require pain medication ) . As part rehabilitation therapy procedure , subject undergo shoulder range motion evaluation ( do train clinician approximately 3 minute ) Computer Dynamic Posturography ( CDP ) test 4 '' tall foam cushion eye close ( PSEC test - less 1 minute test ) therapy session . Subjects complete DASH TOSSA questionnaire ( total amount time require complete assessment ~20 minute ) , test use modified Clinical Testing Sensory Integration Balance ( mCTSIB ) protocol ( subject require stand hard compliant surface ( 4 '' tall foam cushion know mechanical property ) comfortable posture , foot shoulder width , eye open close , head straight arm side free move , gaze forward , breathe normally , less 2 minute test time ) time enrollment end 4 week therapy program . Subjects ask come back two evaluation ( questionnaire , range motion assessment , CDP test ) one month three month end 4 week therapy program identify possible long term effect `` hyper-gravity/accentuated vertical loading '' therapy .</detailed_description>
