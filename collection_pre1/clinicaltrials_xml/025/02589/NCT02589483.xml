	<brief_summary>The anastomotic leak multivariable origin . The incidence vary among different center 4 % high 25 % . The impact leakage rectal anastomosis devastate patient costly health care system . Prolonged hospital stay ( LOS ) , invasive treatment intensive care consequence . The future colorectal surgery increasingly include old patient increase preoperative morbidity probably even high risk anastomotic leak . make suitable reinforce rectal anastomosis . The goal shift clinical leak spectrum subclinical therefore self-healing one .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The rationale explore procedure reinforcement HemoPatch bring mechanical strength extend area around anastomosis thus lower incidence clinical anastomotic leak . The characteristic HemoPatch , structural property flexibility tissue adhesion suitable purpose .</detailed_description>
