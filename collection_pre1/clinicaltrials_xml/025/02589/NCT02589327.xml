	<detailed_description>Excessive cardiac fat accumulation recognize associate increase cardiac metabolic risk . More effective treatment need induce change cardiac fat content , body composition , cardiac fat metabolic activity result reduction cardiovascular risk overweight obese population . Despite need , little known mode , frequency , duration exercise allow great reduction cardiac fat , improvement body composition , restoration healthy cardiac fat metabolic activity , improvement cardiovascular risk marker . The aim study effect exercise cardiac fat content , cardiac function , physical fitness , metabolic activity obesity .</detailed_description>
