	<brief_summary>A novel algorithm bioimpedance measurement detect nerve tissue , discriminate tissue type develop porcine model , analyse complex impedance dataset base multiple measurement frequency . It must confirm previous result applicable human . Measurements 24 predefined needle position obtain 16 32 volunteer include study ( part A ) . A new algorithm detect nerve tissue develop base measurement result . Further impedance algorithm develop tissue type . The efficacy algorithm ( sensitivity specificity ) evaluate 16 follow volunteer ( part B ) .</brief_summary>
