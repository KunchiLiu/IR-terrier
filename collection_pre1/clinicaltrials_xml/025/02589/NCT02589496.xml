	<brief_summary>Gastric cancer ( GC ) second common cause cancer relate mortality fourth common cancer worldwide . The molecular classification GC relevance pre-clinical model well establish , create challenge discover novel molecularly target therapy . In order address issue , conduct integrated molecular data analysis three hundred Asian Gastric tumor Asian Cancer Research Group ( ACRG ) . We perform integrated genomic analysis base target sequence , gene expression profiling , copy number variation , Lauren 's histological classification , Epstein Barr Virus ( EBV ) status , TP53 status three hundred GC specimen . We first divide GC four subgroup base gene expression profile TP53 status : 1. epithelial MSS-TP53 inactive ; 2. epithelial MSS-TP53 active ; 3 . MSI ; 4. mesenchymal . With integrative analysis target sequence copy number variation , epithelial MSS-TP53 inactive GCs characterize predominantly hypermutated intestinal tumor ( include majority mutation KRAS ) MLH1 loss promoter methylation MSS-TP53 active GCs characterize intact TP53 pathway high frequency EBV infection frequently mutate oncogene ( e.g . PIK3CA ) . MSI subtype TP53 pathway inactive characterize TP53 loss deleterious mutation TP53 MDM2 amplification characterize focal amplification oncogene HER2 , EGFR , cMET , CCNE1 well large scale chromosomal gain loss . The subtypes exhibit differential prognosis mesenchymal subtype display bad survival ( 2.2 year ) MSI subtype favorable survival ( 5.6 year ) . The GC subtypes association prognosis independently validate three GC cohort . We additionally show significant association global gene expression immune pattern , like adaptive immune system inflammation , well expression PD-L1 , genomic define subtypes . In phase Ib KEYNOTE-012 study evaluate pembrolizumab monotherapy 10 mg/kg ever 2 week patient gastric cancer recently report . Most patient two prior line therapy . In study , 41 % evaluable patient show tumor shrinkage . The overall response rate 39 patient 31 % . The preliminary data show Not significant correlation PD-L-1 expression ORR ( P=0.071 ) . Given mutual association tumor genetic marker , gene expression potential marker response immune therapy identify collaborative work SMC MERCK MSD Lilly , plan perform phase II study integrative genomic analysis ( whole exome RNA sequencing ) pre post biopsy specimens good define GCs may benefit pembro .</brief_summary>
