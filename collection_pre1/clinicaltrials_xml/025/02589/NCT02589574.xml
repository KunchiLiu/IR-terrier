Studies healthcare provider vaccination programmes report positive effect lower rate influenza like illness influenza related complication , hospitalisation death . Nurses receive influenza vaccination patient may come contact infect nurse . However , immunization rate among nurse constantly low . Therefore , important develop intervention programme increase immunization nurse . In research electronic text message promote public health show potential communication system preventive health behavioural change . With use widely acceptable , accessible convenient approach communication , reminder receive influenza vaccination send nurse involve study . At time , educational message send modify perception positive effect influenza vaccination , therefore , motivate nurse receive vaccination . The study conduct two-arm randomise controlled trial control intervention group run concurrently . Nurses local hospital invite participate study . They receive usual announcement information free influenza vaccination hospital . The participant intervention group also receive text message reminder detail free influenza vaccine educational information . All communication occur secure , asynchronous electronic text message . The reminder educational information develop reference promotion message Department Health framework Health Belief Model promote positive perception influenza vaccination participant . Participants invite complete pre post questionnaire study period . The influenza vaccination status participant perception influenza vaccination obtain .

	<brief_title>Improving Influenza Vaccination Rates Nurses Through Text Message Reminders : RCT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study aim evaluate efficacy text message reminder promote influenza vaccination among nurse Hong Kong local hospital . The primary outcome receipt influenza vaccine end February 2016 report participant . The secondary outcome include proportion participant seek influenza vaccination proportion participant intervention group receptive electronic text message communication education . According study WHO 2005 , influenza vaccine offer approximately 70-90 % protection clinical disease healthy adult . Despite recommendation suggest CHP Hong Kong vaccination receive high risk group healthcare provider include nurse , vaccination rate nurse remain low Annual Seasonal Influenza Uptake Rate 14.41 % 2013 Hong Kong . This finding correspond overseas study influenza vaccine rate nurse among low healthcare provider . Although numerous intervention employ promote Influenza vaccination , cost approach high whilst result large long-lasting increase desire . Moreover , factor inhibit nurse receive vaccination . Studies show nurse perceive low risk influenza . Other reason misunderstand myth influenza acquire vaccine , concern efficacy side effect vaccine , lack time forgot . Nurses also perceive absence immediate threat health , especially young nurse . Hence , tend seek influenza vaccination . A study find one stipulate reason nurse choose vaccinate influenza concern spread disease patient nurse get influenza , second high reason concern get influenza . The finding coherence care nature person enter nursing . Other finding also find recall system educational information emphasis recommend vaccination rank second third effective strategy improve maintain vaccination coverage . Nowadays , use electronic reminder system new nurse Hong Kong . The implementation Clinical Dash Board introduce 10 year ago use generate message alert nurse deal vary unfinished clinical work well appointment patient care . At time , mobile technology consider many next frontier health behaviour change consider vehicle deliver personal adaptive health information anywhere real time . It suggest researcher electronic text message might hold promising result serve reminder . There grow body research text message range health mental health problem . However , none study report receive text message promote vaccination uptake nurse , single large group healthcare provider close encounter people highly susceptible influenza upper respiratory disease . It intention study look issue evaluate efficacy text message reminder promote influenza vaccination among nurse . Subjects study include qualified nurse employ Hong Kong local hospital , own smart phone electronic text message function , willing provide active mobile telephone number . However , qualified nurse already receive influenza vaccination prior commencement vaccination period 2015-16 , history allergy egg , chicken protein neomycin component vaccine , history moderate severe reaction influenza vaccination , history Guillain-Barré Syndrome exclude . As randomised control trial study find literature evaluate effect text message increase influenza vaccine uptake nurse , similar study subject nurse refer . With reference similar study , overall vaccination rate among participant control intervention group range 18.1 % 36.4 % effect size around 18 % . Taking reference influenza vaccination uptake rate local hospital study intend carry 11.56 % seasonal influenza period 2013-14 , estimate vaccination rate nurse intervention group propose study would 17 % . Given α = 0.05 , desire power = 0.8 , compare two proportion , number subject group least 247 . Allowing drop-out rate 25 % , 329 subject group provide desired power . Hence , sample size minimum 658 shall recruit study . Upon receive approval Research Ethics Committee Hospital , email send nurse manager department ward local hospital introduce study . Appointment make individual nurse manager regard appropriate time brief nurse . It plan carry briefing session recommend period nurse available attend . The investigator provide verbal explanation distribute information sheet participants prior commencement data collection . Participants encourage clarify query relate study . Participation study entirely voluntary participant right withdraw refuse give information time study without incur penalty deprivation service . The purpose procedure study well risk benefit participation explain . With understanding , participant invite sign write consent form . Attached , self-administered questionnaire give participant complete . The complete questionnaire return investigator time briefing . For complete post-intervention questionnaire telephone interview , message texted subject use redemption $ 10 cash coupon investigator . This study conduct respect individual participant accordance requirement study protocol also International Conference Harmonisation E6 Good Clinical Practice applicable law regulation , include without limitation , data privacy law , clinical trial disclosure law , regulation . Subjects recruit November 2015 follow data collection via pre post questionnaire survey March 2016 . A randomizer , involve part study , develop randomise intervention allocation sequence use random block size two , four , six . Sequentially numbered , opaque seal envelope contain assignment information prepare kept investigator responsible participant recruitment . When informed write consent obtain , investigator select next envelope sequence decide intervention allocation . During study period , four electronic text message send intervention group participant . Messages contain educational information fact epidemic , nurse close contact high risk patient , likely get influenza infection ; vaccination reduce personal risk influenza illness also reduce risk infect patient family member ; reduce chance sick leave due influenza-like illness , vaccination turn reduce work pressure ; lastly also social expectation professional well personal responsibility nurse protect self patient contact influenza . The text message reinforce fact influenza dangerous nurse patient also mention . Therefore , potential side effect reason vaccinate . Vaccination cause influenza infection reduce immunity . Influenza vaccine safe vaccine . The message send intervention group participant weekly basis 4 week . All communication occur secure , asynchronous electronic text message apps . The education information develop reference promotion message Department Health framework health belief model four construct individual base perception , namely perceived benefit , perceive barrier , perceive susceptibility , perceive seriousness illness threat . Data analysis start April 2016 August 2016 , report generate finding disseminate . A research assistant , involve participant recruitment blind participant ' intervention allocation , responsible assessment study outcome . The influenza vaccination status participant obtain telephone follow research assistant . The project evaluate quantitative method . All participant ask complete questionnaire influenza season . The questionnaire include participant ' vaccination status , perception influenza vaccination , history contact influenza experience influenza-like illness , experience perception effectiveness use electronic text message reminder promote health intervention . The study analyse conduct use SPSS 21.0 . The significant level select analysis P ≤ 0.05 . Descriptive baseline characteristic group tabulate mean standard deviation proportion . Differences demographic characteristic intervention control group analyse use t-test continuous data chi-square test categorical data . The primary concern study compare influenza vaccine uptake two study group . For primary outcome influenza vaccine uptake , investigator calculate risk difference ( RD ) relative risk ( RR ) correspond 95 % confidence interval ( 95 % CI ) . The efficacy analysis perform accordance intention-to-treat principle miss data take vaccination receive . Differences facilitator also compare , use chi-square test . To protect privacy participant , data would handle stored investigator confidential way completion study . All data set would handle line Hospital 's policy handling , storage destruction confidential record . They would keep investigator cabinet lock locate office . Electronic data would save secure computer investigator 's office restrict access . Access data would make approval Principal Investigator , hence , confidentiality anonymity assure .</detailed_description>
