	<brief_summary>The purpose study test innovative combination direct-attention training metacognitive training treatment attention impairment Veterans moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) report experience attentional problem . Enrolled participant randomize receive either direct-attention training metacognitive training first cross receive opposite intervention . The study consist two treatment period 4 week post-treatment 4 week later . In addition rehabilitation treatment , participant also perform measure complex functional activity ( e.g. , independent activity daily live IADLs ) neurocognitive test attention-control function . Participants also perform attentional task probe function three different attentional system brain wave activity ( i.e. , electroencephalography EEG ) record order ass change brain function may improve rehabilitation approach . Planned enrollment 36 Veterans .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Attention impairment ubiquitous TBI survivor . This devastate impairment attention backbone cognitive system . Attention requisite cognitive process vital everyday function memory , problem solving , language skill , cognitive control behavior . Studies attention train show improved attention laboratory measure , limited translation real-world task . Notably , previously-tested rehabilitation approach include train cognitive process need translation train everyday task include internal verbalization self-monitoring , also call metacognitive strategy . One training method metacognitive strategy show promise , lack basic attention training . Rehabilitation specialist recently argue rehabilitation approach wherein basic foundational attention metacognitive strategy synergistically combine . Consequently , investigator test innovative combination direct-attention training metacognitive training compensates disadvantage . Because promise type training separately , potential additive effect combination , critical test combine attention metacognitive training Veteran survivor chronic moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) . The investigator address follow two specific aim : investigator propose conduct pilot study examine cognitive rehabilitation therapy ( CRT ) effect group Veterans chronic moderate severe TBI ( m/sTBI ) , focus remediate attention-control impairment use direct-attention metacognitive-strategy training approach AB/BA crossover design 1-month follow-up address follow two specific aim : 1 ) Test treatment response combine direct-attention metacognitive-strategy training Veterans chronic m/sTBI ; 2 ) identify mechanisms biomarkers rehabilitation-related neuroplasticity . Under first aim investigator test effect combine direct-attention metacognitive-strategy training measure complex functional activity neurocognitive test attention-control function . Under second aim , investigator test effect CRT approach behavioral brain activity participant perform well-validated attentional task probe function three dissociable attentional system . The approach innovative combine theoretically motivate novel approach address significant source disability Veteran survivor TBI . The propose research significant finding form foundation larger-scale trial enable u determine durability gain functional impact treatment Veteran 's real world activity positively shape healthcare Veterans suffer TBI . Outcome measure include standardized test neurocognitive function attention cognitive skill , measure self care , ability live independently , social role participation , life satisfaction , TBI-related quality life , mood/anxiety , attention-related scalp-recorded brain event-related potential ( ERPs , derive electroencephalography ) .</detailed_description>
