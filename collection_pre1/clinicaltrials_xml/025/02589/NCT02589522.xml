	<brief_title>VX-970 Whole Brain Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Brain Metastases From Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To conduct phase 1 dose escalation trial patient brain metastases non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) determine recommend phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) twice weekly intravenous ( i.v . ) VX-970 administer concurrent conventionally fractionated whole brain radiotherapy ( WBRT ) , VX-970 start 18-30 hour first dose radiation ( prior second fraction radiation ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate incidence &gt; = grade 3 delayed neurological toxicity 2 , 4 6-months post-completion whole-brain radiotherapy ( patient without intracranial progression ) . II . To estimate radiological response rate ( RR ) include bi-directional volumetric measurement lesion size . III . To estimate intracranial 2- , 4- , 6-month progression-free survival ( PFS ) . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Changes dynamic susceptibility contrast enhancement ( DSC-magnetic resonance image [ MRI ] ) perfusion mean apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC ) measurements diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging ( DWI ) . ( Group I ) II . To measure cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) VX-970 level , tumor VX-970 level , pATR T1989 , pCHK1 S345 RAD51 multiplex focus . ( Group II ) III . Changes DSC-MRI perfusion mean ADC measurement DWI . ( Group II ) OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study ATR kinase inhibitor VX-970 . Patients assign 1 2 treatment group . GROUP I : Patients undergo whole-brain radiation therapy daily ( QD ) , 5 day week 15 fraction . Patients also receive ATR kinase inhibitor VX-970 intravenously ( IV ) 60-90 minute twice week , 18-30 hour first radiation therapy . Treatment continue 3 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . GROUP II : Patients receive ATR kinase inhibitor VX-970 IV 60-90 minute 2-4 hour prior surgery . After surgery , patient undergo whole-brain radiation therapy receive ATR kinase inhibitor VX-970 Group I . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 2 month 6 month , every 3 month 6 month , every 6 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
