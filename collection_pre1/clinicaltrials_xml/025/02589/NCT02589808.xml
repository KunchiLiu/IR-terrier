	<brief_summary>This study compare finding use handheld ultrasound device ( GE VScan ) use diagnostic ultrasound machine adult patient refer transthoracic echo ( TTE ) , prior non-cardiac surgery Hammersmith Hospital , London . The handheld TTE ( VTTE ) follow standard Hammersmith Hospital diagnostic TTE ( DTTE ) protocol ( exception spectral Doppler ) report simple 'tick box ' form . A different echocardiographer perform report DTTE per routine practice . The result VTTE DTTE directly compare . The echocardiographers perform VTTE DTTE fully accredit diagnostic TTE blind others finding . The study aim recruit total 96 patient anticipate study completion date November 2015 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Handheld echocardiography become practical reality development small highly portable device . The GE VScan one device number study examine diagnostic capability different clinical setting however , study examine capability screen non-cardiac surgical patient preoperative setting . If VTTE could show safely screen patient preoperatively potential save time money . DTTE costly VTTE often delay perform DTTE prior surgery . Adult patient &gt; 17 year old refer preoperative TTE prior non-cardiac surgery ( elective emergency procedure ) eligible recruitment . Once eligible patient identify verbal write consent participate obtain . VTTE perform one six accredited echocardiographers work Hammersmith Hospital Echocardiography Department . Based pilot data previously publish study estimate VTTE take 3 7 minute . The VTTE report 'tick box ' form finding separate significant pathology ( red zone ) insignificant pathology normal finding ( black zone ) . DTTE perform different echocardiographer write report prepare per normal practice . The write DTTE report convert 'tick box ' report enable direct comparison VTTE DTTE . The primary aim ass ability VTTE detect significant pathology identify DTTE . A proportion DTTE VTTE re-rated obtain measure inter- intra- observer variability .</detailed_description>
