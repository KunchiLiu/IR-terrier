	<brief_title>REFIT Hearing : Remote Fitting Hearing Aids</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Background rationale : Currently , fit hearing aid use computer interface allow adjust gain compression acoustic amplification . This adjustment make face face , patient audiologist locate soundproof space test effectiveness hearing aid . However , advance telemedicine context , let consider possibility address hear aid fit via computer interface , remotely control hear care professional . The purpose study assess ability perform test longer front patient setting , away , without visual sound contact computer interface . 2 . Objectives Main objective : To show remote fit hearing aid use platform develop AudioProConnect provide speech perception score similar obtain face-control , 5 week use among experienced hearing aid user . Secondary Objectives : To compare duration quality type fitting , speech noise testing , deafness relate quality life ass wear time hearing aid . 3 . Methods DESIGN : Biomedical research health product , prospective , multicenter , randomize , crossover study assess remote fit hearing aid : Study REFIT-HEARING Study Population : adult bilateral hearing aid . Inclusion criterion : Patient age 18 85 year old , hearing loss use two hear aid one year , compatible AudioProConnect platform . Exclusion criterion : Patient fluctuation pure tone audiometry , cognitive disorder severe speech disorder . Patient unable move audiology laboratory . Primary Outcome : Evaluation speech perception score PBK test free-field 60 dB . Secondary endpoint : assessment quality control measure pitch gain , duration fitting minute , speech noise audiometry , wear time hear aid hour , quality life relate hearing loss via APHAB questionnaire . Number patient : 60 subject Procedure ( number visit , length inclusion , duration follow-up , study schedule patient visit content , brief description intervention ) : After investigator verify criterion inclusion / non inclusion subject sign write informed consent , subject follow period range 2 month 5 month , attend four visit audiology laboratory reference project . During visit , fit hear aid face face remotely realize , ask answer questionnaire ass quality life two fitting technique . Study Schedule : Inclusion period : 3 month ( M3-M6 ) Duration study one subject : 2 month 5 month ( M6 M8 M6 M11 ) Duration statistical analysis / recovery : 3 month ( M11-M14 ) Global Study duration : 14 month 4 . Outlook At end , project want show remote fit provide comparable result to-face fitting term speech perception , order able offer type strategy .</detailed_description>
