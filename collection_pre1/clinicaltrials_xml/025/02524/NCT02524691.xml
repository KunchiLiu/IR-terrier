	<detailed_description>Premature rupture membrane ( PROM ) , define spontaneous rupture membrane ( ROM ) onset uterine contraction , one common diagnostic dilemma contemporary obstetrical practice . Premature rupture membrane occur gestational age , preterm PROM ( PPROM , define PROM 37 week ) responsible 20-40 % preterm birth . Early accurate diagnosis PROM would allow gestational age-specific obstetrical intervention design optimize perinatal outcome minimize serious complication cord prolapse , preterm delivery , fetal distress infectious morbidity ( chorioamnionitis , neonatal sepsis ) . Conversely , false-positive diagnosis PROM may lead unnecessary obstetric intervention , include hospitalization , administration antibiotic corticosteroid , even induction labor . Therefore , correct timely diagnosis disorder critical importance clinician PROM PPROM may associate serious maternal neonatal consequence . The diagnosis fetal membrane rupture conventionally make use clinical assessment . The common method diagnosis include sterile speculum exam ( SSE ) include visual inspection pool fluid posterior fornix , nitrazine/pH test vaginal environment , microscopic evaluation collect specimen ( ferning ) . If sterile speculum exam , clinician observe amniotic fluid leak cervical o , diagnosis rupture make without three additional evaluation . Although SSE approach consider acceptable standard , require intrusive ( speculum ) examination may provide rapid accurate diagnosis . The literature show SSE limitation term diagnostic accuracy , cost technical ease . The test become progressively less accurate one hour elapse membrane rupture . The nitrazine assessment , common method determine status membrane hospital today , sensitivity report 90-97 % , specificity low 16-70 % . The poor specificity think due high rate false-positives cause cervicitis , vaginitis , contamination blood , urine , semen antiseptic agent . The reported sensitivity specificity fern test also less adequate , 51 % 70 % respectively . As result , rapid , point care , qualitative immunochromatographic test ( ie. , ROM Plus® , Amnisure® ) recently gain popularity aid diagnosis fetal membrane rupture . These test design detect protein find amniotic fluid high concentration . One test , ROM Plus , use unique monoclonal/polyclonal antibody approach detect two different protein find amniotic fluid high concentration . ROM Plus detects Placental Protein-12 ( PP-12 , also know Insulin-like Growth Factor Binding Protein-1 ) well Alpha Fetoprotein ( AFP ) . The combination PP12 AFP chosen robust historical literature support ideal protein marker amniotic fluid , also unique characteristic . PP12 synthesize decidua placenta reach high concentration level amniotic fluid early first trim stay level delivery . AFP synthesize fetal liver yolk sac reach peak concentration late second trimester/early third trimester . This increase chance protein detect , especially preterm patient , diagnosis ROM crucial . Amnisure use monoclonal/monoclonal antibody approach detect one protein , Placenta-Alpha Microglobulin-1 ( PAMG-1 ) . This study design assess performance ( sensitivity , specificity , PPV , NPV ) ROM Plus Amnisure compare standard clinical assessment include limited nitrazine , ferning and/or sterile speculum exam confirm thorough chart review delivery .</detailed_description>
