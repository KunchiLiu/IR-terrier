	<brief_summary>Caffeine routinely use management apnea prematurity . Extremely low birth weight ( ELBW ) infants high risk mortality various neonatal morbidity bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD ) caffeine show beneficial low birth weight ( VLBW ) infant . The investigator ' previous unpublished retrospective study recently publish retrospective study demonstrate early caffeine give within 48 hour age tend decrease incidence death BPD ELBW newborn . Retrospective design bias newborn mild lung disease may receive caffeine early extubation . There several study pharmacodynamics pharmacokinetics caffeine . The data regard cumulative dosage caffeine , caffeine level BPD outcome deficient . Primary objective study test hypothesis early caffeine give within 24 hour life decrease incidence mortality BPD ventilate ELBW newborn . This study also test additional hypothesis high caffeine dosage caffeine level associate decreased mortality postnatal morbidity study newborn .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Versus Late Caffeine ELBW Newborns</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Parents approach either prenatally impending delivery ELBW newborn within 16 hour birth . 90 newborn randomize receive early caffeine within 24 hour life ( `` study drug '' ) 90 newborn receive placebo . Either early caffeine ( `` study drug '' ) placebo continue throughout first 15 day life . Newborns early caffeine group receive IV bolus 20mg/kg follow IV PO 5mg/kg daily 14 day . The clinical team choose give PO caffeine newborn tolerate &gt; 75 % fluid goal feed . The clinical research team blind ; neither know whether newborn receive early caffeine placebo . The clinical team allow use open label caffeine deem medically necessary 24 hour receive either early caffeine placebo . Often clinical need would time extubation ( peri-extubation ) comprise `` late '' caffeine group , also placebo group . Perinatal postnatal clinical characteristic prospectively collect . Clinical team may choose hold study drug newborn place high frequency ventilation need sedation drip surgical procedure . Two blood sample collect one day 7 one day 14 caffeine level . Data safety monitoring committee review mortality morbidity group quarterly basis recruitment every 30 newborn whichever happen earlier .</detailed_description>
