	<brief_summary>Obesity metabolic disease result energy intake consistently exceed energy expenditure . One appeal new target treatment activation brown adipose tissue ( BAT ) , organ recently find functional adult human . Brown adipocytes selectively express uncouple protein 1 ( UCP1 ) , render inner membrane mitochondrion leaky , thereby divert chemical energy ATP generation heat production . Interest BAT spur recognition addition classical BAT depot , brown-fat-like cell present subcutaneous white adipose tissue ( WAT ) animal also humans.These cell structural functional property resemble brown adipocytes , refer beige 'brite ' ( brown-in-white ) adipocytes . Interestingly , brown WAT induced animal human physiological stimulus cold exposure , increase adrenergic tone , exercise , selectively drive WAT brown irisin , exercise-induced myokine . In addition b-adrenergic drug pharmacological agent , prostaglandin , induce brown white adipose tissue . More recently , one study show treatment C57BL/6 mouse phosphodiesterase inhibitor sildenafil ( 12 mg/kg/d ) 7 cause 4.6-fold increase uncouple protein-1 expression promote establishment brown fat cell-like phenotype ( `` browning '' ) WAT vivo . Therefore , investigator hypothesize sildenafil promote brown white adipose tissue improve insulin sensitivity human adult .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sildenafil Activates Browning White Adipose Improves Insulin Sensitivity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study subject take placebo ( first stage ) sildenafil ( second stage ) intervention 7 day , respectively afterward.Subcutaneous fat tissue muscle sample obtain biopsy individual measure brown white adipose tissue insulin signaling.The insulin sensitivity test insulin clamp assay intervention , respectively . In addition , blood sample biochemical analysis obtain intervention , respectively . The brown white adipose tissue measure expression peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ ( PPARγ ) , PPARγcoactivator 1α ( PGC-1α ) , uncouple protein 1 ( UCP-1 ) , second messenger cyclic guanosine-3 ' , 5'-monophosphate ( cGMP ) , PR domain contain 16 zinc finger transcription factor ( Prdm16 ) deiodinase , iodothyronine , type II ( DIO2 ) .The metabolic maker measure blood pressure , heart rate , thyroid function , rest metabolic rate , respiratory quotient , blood cGMP , blood insulin blood glucose .</detailed_description>
