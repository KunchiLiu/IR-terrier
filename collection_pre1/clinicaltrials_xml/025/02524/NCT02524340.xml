	<brief_title>Patient Centered Adaptive Treatment Strategies Using Bayesian Causal Inference</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During routine clinical care , patient physician often confront following question : `` Given ( child 's ) responses previous treatment , best treatment option ( child ) ? '' ( patient/parent ) `` What treatment recommend patient fail respond first ( second ) line treatment ? '' ( physician ) . Both question heart patient center outcome research clinical care , yet answer question seriously hinder lack adequate analytic method appropriately take account fact treatment , well determinant treatment decision , vary time course disease . Case point : despite many medication option , polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis ( pJIA ) often refractory , require well adaptive treatment strategy ( ATS ) . Three ATS recommend panel expert pJIA patient , need adequate analysis method evaluate identify good ATS use observational data . Motivated patient-centered question , rigorously design evaluate clinical effectiveness patient center adaptive treatment strategy ( PCATS ) , propose method development directly address : `` development dissemination method adequate analysis data case treatment/exposure vary time '' , area interest identify PCORI . Accomplishing propose study provide much need double robust Bayesian causal inference method take challenge analyze large registry electronic health record include model uncertainty , large dimensional covariates unmeasured confounders , account . A web-based userfriendly analytic computational package develop allow easy application propose method . These development : 1 ) immediately offer method computational tool evaluate clinical effectiveness inform optimal ATS , 2 ) near future , enable shared-decision making tool identify optimal PCATS point-of-care , 3 ) eventually enable rapid learn system facilitate optimal PCATS . This study immediate impact child stakeholder JIA long-term broad impact many chronically ill patient . Successful completion project significantly move PCORI close mission help `` people make good inform healthcare decision improve healthcare delivery outcomes '' .</detailed_description>
