	<brief_title>UVADEX® ECP Treatment Pediatric Patients With Steroid Refractory Acute Graft Versus Host Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Screening : After inform consent/assent form ( ICF ) sign , screen assessment perform single visit establish eligibility patient , base inclusion exclusion criterion , well aGvHD grade . Scheduling first week ECP treatments arrangement availability type cross-matched donor pack red blood cell ( PRBCs ) transfusion , require , make advance patient enter Treatment Period . Treatment Period : Once eligibility establish , patient enter 12-week ECP Treatment Period . The availability type cross-matched donor PRBCs transfusion treatment , need , establish prior schedule ECP treatment . Patients allow continue standard aGvHD prophylaxis regimen ( e.g. , cyclosporine , tacrolimus , methotrexate , mycophenolate mofetil ) without addition new therapy . Patients allow discontinue prophylaxis regimen reason toxicity , also allow switch another prophylaxis medication within class ( e.g. , calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporine tacrolimus ) reason toxicity . All patient enrol trial receive corticosteroid treatment aGvHD . After enter treatment period study , taper steroid total weekly decrement 12.5 % 25 % steroid dose initiation ECP therapy permit sustained response aGvHD observe least 3 consecutive day , suggest goal decrease start steroid dose least 50 % 4 week initiation ECP . Follow-Up Period : After completion 12-week Treatment Period , patient may continue ECP treatment commercial product Principal Investigator 's discretion . Acute GvHD status assess 4 week completion Treatment Period . Patient survival assess passive follow-up ( chart review ) 26 week initiation ECP treatment .</detailed_description>
