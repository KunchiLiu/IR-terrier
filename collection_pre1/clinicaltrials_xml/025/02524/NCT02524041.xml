	<brief_summary>Based evidence periostin specifically involved intra-cortical remodel control , work hypothesis assessment concentration serum would helpful identify patient severe cortical porosity , critical parameter bone fragility . Periostin expression osteoblast osteocytes part bone cortical response anabolic stimuli mechanical strain intermittent increase parathyroid hormone . However , remain unknown whether expression may participate well mechanisms lead exaggerate intra-cortical remodel subsequent bone loss . In rare clinical situation trans-iliac bone biopsy necessary good understand bone status addition densitometry biological bone marker assessment , specific analysis use immune-staining technique perform bone sample . Data routine follow-up every six month also collect specific sub-group . High resolution peripheral quantitative computerize tomography ( HR-pQCT ) give opportunity perform virtual bone biopsy provide information trabecular cortical microarchitecture vivo . These microarchitectural parameter allow accurate evaluation alteration bone structure therefore fracture risk compare current tool use clinical practice densitometry . However , availability HRpQCT facility limit on-going development best way measure porosity example . The definition biological profile include key protein periostin sclerostin involved porosity mechanism therefore great interest . A good understanding relationship bone matrix component parathyroid hormone effect also appear critical . Follow-up routine evaluation parameter reflect bone status subgroup specific patient could also provide new additional information .</brief_summary>
