	<brief_title>SMS Reminders Improve Medication Adherence Aromatase Inhibitors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study prospective randomise control parallel trial SMS reminder versus standard care investigate whether SMS reminder improve adherence oral aromatase inhibitor ( AI ) therapy amongst woman breast cancer 1-year follow-up . All subject randomise receive either SMS reminder standard care 1:1 ratio . Balanced permute block randomisation implement random vary block size 4 6 . The sample size estimate base primary endpoint medication adherence ( measure via SMAQ ) 1-year . Assuming proportion medication adherence intervention control group 80 % 60 % respectively , base 5 % significance level power 90 % , minimum sample 240 subject ( i.e . 120 per group ) require . Further assume attrition rate 10 % , anticipate trial size 280 overall . The assessment medication adherence 1-year ( measure via SMAQ ) SMS reminder control group make use chi-square test , treatment effect quantify use odds ratio estimate 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) . Adjustment potential confounders make use logistic regression appropriate . Other measure adherence 1-year medication possession ratio ( MPR ) , proportion day cover ( PDC ) , pill count compare treatment arm via t- test , adjustment confounders make via analysis covariance ( ANCOVA ) . The assessment multiple dependent secondary outcome variable involve estrone , estradiol androstenedione level make use multivariate analysis variance ( MANOVA ) . The treatment effect quantify base mean difference hormone level group 95 % CI , adjust respective baseline level . The assessment knowledge , attitude , behavior , well barrier facilitate factor intervention control group make use chi-square test , treatment effect quantify base odds ratio estimate 95 % CI . Further adjustment baseline score potential confounders make use logistic regression appropriate . Additionally , investigator compare 4 different measure adherence separate paper , determine provide meaningful reliable information local context base sensitivity analysis . All analysis perform accord intention-to-treat use STATA , assume two-sided test 5 % level significance .</detailed_description>
