	<detailed_description>Single-arm , single-institution , non-randomized , open-label phase II study determine efficacy safety treatment LEE011 chemoembolization patient advance HCC ( Hepatocellular Carcinoma ) amenable curative therapy . A total 40 patient enrol undergo chemoembolization . Patients receive LEE011 ( 600 mg PO daily , 3 week on/1 week ) Day 1 chemoembolization . Patients receive total 4 chemoembolization treatment within 6 month follow first treatment need treat initial HCC ( Hepatocellular Carcinoma ) lesion . Progression free survival base tumor assessment use RECIST 1.1 criterion ( Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ) Patients receive trial treatment disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , death discontinuation study treatment reason . Patients follow survival regardless treatment discontinuation reason . The study include men woman locally advanced HCC ( Hepatocellular Carcinoma ) amenable curative therapy receive prior therapy advance disease . Investigational Therapy : LEE011 oral ( 3 week on/1 week ) combination chemoembolization . Efficacy Assessments : 1 . Dynamic contrast abdominal compute tomography magnetic resonance image do baseline , every 8 week , every 3 month thereafter follow initial chemoembolization . 2 . Chest CT image clinically indicate 3 . Survival status every 12 month ( earlier require ) regardless treatment discontinuation reason Data Analysis : The primary endpoint trial progression free survival ( PFS ) HCC patient . PFS define time initiation treatment progression death without evidence progression . For case without documentation progression , follow-up censor date last disease assessment without progression , unless death occurs within 4 month follow date last progression-free , case death count event . The historical median PFS TACE ( Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization ) alone 8-10 month . This study target hazard ratio 0.69 80 % power one-sided significance level 10 % . Assuming 24-month accrual 18-month follow-up period study require 38 patient initiate LEE011 treatment median PFS TACE alone 8 month , 41 patient median PFS TACE ( Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization ) alone 10 month . PFS estimate use Kaplan-Meier method , Greenwood 's formula use calculate standard error correspond Kaplan-Meier estimate 95 % confidence interval . Survival curve estimate use Kaplan-Meier methodology . Secondary endpoint efficacy evaluate OS ( Overall Survival ) . The statistical method use analysis PFS use analysis OS . Other secondary objective include description toxicity therapy regimen . These data analyze separately . The safety analyse perform patient receive dose therapy . Adverse event describe use NCI CTCAE v 4.03 criterion ( ctep.cancer.gov/forms.CTCAEv4.pdf ) . Frequency severity adverse event accord NCI CTCAE ) v 4.03 ( Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ) body system severity criterion describe . In addition , frequency Grade 3 4 adverse event describe separately . Causality also note . Adverse event record 1 year follow discontinuation study . Response rate toxicity rate estimate use exact binomial method along 95 % confidence interval</detailed_description>
