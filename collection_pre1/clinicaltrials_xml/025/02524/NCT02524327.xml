	<brief_title>Frail Status Elderly Patients After Repair Anesthesia Guided bispectraL Index</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To date , patient age 60 yr represent 25 % population increase risk surgical repair . Reduction postoperative morbidity mortality two main concern medical research . Dependence caregiver cognitive impairment two major risk elderly even frail patient surgery general anesthesia . In context continuous monitoring depth anesthesia bispectral index may reduce occurrence well control deep sedation period ( vasopressorsâ€¦ ) . Previous study investigator ' team suggest good duration expect interval Bispectral Index automate control administration intravenous anesthetic guide Bispectral Index . This method remain tested high-risk population . As consequence , randomization two group carry elderly patient ( &gt; 70 yr ) : manual administration anesthetic guide Bispectral Index ( manual group ) automate administration ( automate group ) . Complete preoperative assessment determine FRAIL status ( decrease physiological reserve ) abilities patient accord self-sufficient scale . At six month follow-up determine geriatric status patient explore rate impairment examine predictive factor preoperative assessment . Finally , influence method administration report . Four hundred thirty patient include multicenter study 215 patient per group stratification presence cancer abdominal repair . The follow-up study allow patient his/her relative keep touch physician prescribe therapy early frailty cognitive impairment appear .</detailed_description>
