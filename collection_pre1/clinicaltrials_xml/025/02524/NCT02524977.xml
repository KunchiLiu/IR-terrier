	<brief_summary>Study objective improve decision-making thromboprophylaxis patient Atrial Fibrillation ( AF ) develop implement computerized decision support tool individual patient-level decision-making oral anticoagulant therapy . To accomplish goal , investigator study incremental impact add quality-improvement ( QI ) intervention educational package ( practice staff clinician ) use computerize aid , Atrial Fibrillation Decision Support Tool ( AFDST ) individual patient-level decision-making oral anticoagulant therapy patient non-valvular AF . The decision support tool incorporates individual patient ' risk factor profile ischemic stroke bleed provide recommendation treatment base upon project quality-adjusted life expectancy gain lose addition either oral anticoagulant therapy aspirin compare thromboprophylaxis .</brief_summary>
