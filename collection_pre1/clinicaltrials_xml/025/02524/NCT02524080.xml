In project `` Care right care level '' ( CRC ) Emergency Medical Services ( EMS ) triage patient need primary health care Primary Care ( PC ) instead Emergency Department ( ED ) . This intervention implement medical safety traditional care ED patient relatives experience correspond confidence healthcare provider . To prepare intervention patient group care need identify retrospective journal review guideline develop . To evaluate patient ' relative ' experience intervention , finally interview implement .

	<detailed_description>Background The research care science approach , patient focus , general aim describe care strengthen support health . Further , health care science approach recognize patient 's suffering motivation care . In study non-urgent patient patient illness , injury ill-health suitable health care receive PC . The PC able take care problem urgent unlikely require admission . The problem need specialize service ED , facility , urgent intervention , rapid and/or complex diagnostic could equally manage PC . For increased survival , reduce risk complication ability quickly return functional life , important coherent chain care . The EMS Prehospital Emergency Nurses ( PEN : ) important part many treatment chain , fast track pathway , example patient stroke , heart attack , hip fracture geriatric care.The care model EMS currently follow , mean virtually patient transport ED regardless medical need seriousness , consistent current medical guideline . Studies show around 25 % patient arrive ED treat another level care right care . There also connection increase mortality overload ED . The need emergency care large tends increase , particularly elderly population ( ≥ 65 year ) . For resource utilized effectively , health care give level care appropriate . This require different provider responsibility patient think outside box , base individual patient 's need care . In addition , assume cooperation coordination enable organizational change , provide good care patient 's perspective . The number care seeker tend rise health care resource must use efficiently cope increase patient . Today healthcare provider , Country Council , PC Community Care , n't collaborate , although share responsibility . According health care prioritization decision , witch control need care time care . For resource utilize efficiently , care provide care level appropriate . However achieve today , regional guideline . The problem exist nationally study show also internationally problem , number care seeker increase , problem tends grow . Studies explain lot patient could go PC . And mean one third patient care another level ED . A new model extend prehospital emergency care , try , mean assessment patient 's condition need continue care make collection point , patient 's medical condition make possible . The health care model call `` Care right care level '' ( CRC ) , mean assessment treatment intervention implement , decision treatment plan consultation general physician ( GP ) patient 's PC . Decisions continue care , example , implicate patient receives visit time GP immediately later , run directly ED . Aims The overall aim investigate possible Prehospital Emergency Nurse ( PEN ) triage non-urgent patient optimal care level Primary Care ( PC ) . Issues : - How patient experience trust healthcare ? - Is new care model medical safe ? Study 1 Title : Swedish emergency medical service ' identification potential candidate primary healthcare . Resubmitted June 2015 , Scandinavian Journal Primary Health Care . The aim investigate possible isolate identify patient group care need , triaged primary care instead ED . Study 2 Title : Patients suspect primary healthcare problem use emergency medical service - Developing questionnaire measure patient trust healthcare . In manuscript . The aim develop instrument measure patient 's confidence health care . Study 3 Title : Care right care level - intervention study . Ongoing April 2013 . The aim study investigate possible triage less sick injured patient another level care medical safety still confidence healthcare . Study 4 Title : Prehospital emergency care patient primary care need - Patients ' experience The aim study describe patient 's lived experience treat new care model . Ethical consideration In intervention study ( study 3 ) , risk patient need secondary transport Healthcare Center ED . To reduce risk PEN always take contact physician Primary care clinic , patient CRC-project randomize The Primary care . It also always risk patient feel depend feel duty participate study . So important PEN provide correct information free . Except mentioned ethical consideration aspected arise . The benefit consider high , risk consider small . Hypothesis With CRC-model patient receive optimal health care feel trust healthcare traditional healthcare . Primary secondary endpoint . The primary endpoint proportion receive optimal care experience trust care traditional care.Secondary endpoint correct preliminary assessment/final diagnosis without secondary transport . The relation study logical . To intervention study , necessary know witch patient´s possible include . And PEN need decision support help triage right patient right level care ( study 1 ) . For evaluate patient still feel confidence healthcare , measure instrument need , also validate ( study 2 ) . To know possible triage non-urgent patient group Healthcare Center , investigator try intervention , evaluate project ( study 3 ) . To get deep understanding patient relatives experience obtain new healthcare model , interview do ( study 4 ) .</detailed_description>
