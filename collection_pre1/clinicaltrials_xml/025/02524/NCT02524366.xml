	<brief_summary>We propose randomized non-blinded comparison standard vs. transcorporal approach placement artificial urinary sphincter male patient stress urinary incontinence radiation radical prostatectomy prostate cancer . In United States , artificial urinary sphincter ( AUS ) , manufacture American Medical Systems , gold standard surgical treatment stress urinary incontinence ( SUI ) men . The cuff , portion device encircles occludes urethra , typically place directly around urethra ( i.e. , `` standard '' placement ) . The cuff erode urethra . Transcorporal placement introduce method reduce risk erosion . Transcorporal placement involve tunnel cuff erectile body protect dorsal aspect urethra . This approach never compare standard placement randomize fashion . In randomized trial , additional procedure beyond normal care protocol require patient . We conduct study establish , IRB-approved multi-institutional network surgeon . Success assess via objective subjective method ; complication tally standardized fashion . Outcomes measured two year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Transcorporal Versus Standard Artificial Urinary Sphincter Placement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The AUS gold standard treatment severe SUI , particularly patient follow surgical resection prostate prostate cancer . In fact , severe urinary incontinence distress complication follow radical prostatectomy result negative impact quality life ( Haab , Trockman et al . 1997 ) . Placement AUS show result improve quality life patient . AUSs small device prevent urinary flow via compression urethra , thus mimic native urinary sphincter . They available , albeit occasional improvement change design , since 1970 's . When placed standard fashion ( ST ) small incision make patient 's perineum scrotum fluid-filled cuff place around bulbar urethra ( portion urethra bladder neck penis ) . Connected cuff tubing , balloon fill fluid place behind pubic bone space peritoneum abdominal muscle . A control pump place scrotum allows device cycle , thus either exert pressure close urethra releasing pressure allow urethra open patient void . 73-76 % patient experience dramatic improvement incontinence minimal leakage ( 0-1 pad per day ) 88-89 % report significant improvement cure . Two year follow implant , 9 % patient experience significant decline functionality device report severe incontinence . At 5 year , 28 % need undergo revision device ( Dalkin , Wessells et al . 2003 ) . Long-term complication associate device include urethral erosion 5 % case , urethral atrophy , infection , mechanical failure device . Patients undergo radical prostatectomy frequently undergo radiation treatment course illness . Radiation pelvic region responsible compromising blood flow urethra fibrosis . As result patient moderate risk develop complication ultimately failure device necessitate removal and/or replacement . Factors put patient high-risk category include history urethroplasty urethral stricture , history prior artificial urinary sphincter , history open surgery bladder neck contracture ( scar entrance bladder ) . Patients develop complication list , often require replacement AUS different location first cuff . This do distally penis urethra narrow less tissue fill cuff . This put high risk complication . Several author recently publish experience modification standard technique patient high risk failure ( Guralnick , Miller et al . 2002 ) ( Aaronson , Elliott et al . 2008 ) . The modified technique , term transcorporal placement ( TC ) , show beneficial subset patient . In one study , 28 % high-risk patient ST placement develop erosion infection , require explanting device compare 13 % TC group ( 4 ) . Continence also well high-risk group TC placement use , compare ST , 89 % vs 61 % . TC placement also reduce risk injury urethra surgery . Unlike ST , TC placement involve place device around urethra also incorporate flap tough tunica albigunea . The incision make ST approach , incision make corpus cavernosum ( cylinder tissue allow erection ) . This allow cuff place around urethra line corporal body , increase bulk tissue behind urethra protect erosion . It suggest place cuff near erectile tissue might cause erectile dysfunction result surgeon perform procedure potent patient . However , scant data exist support refute hypothetical effect erectile function . Despite success patient high risk erosion , TC approach never adequately tested patient without high risk failure . It unknown technique benefit subset patient whether patient might experience good long-term continence less risk erosion . Study Objectives The purpose study improve long-term patient outcome reduce complication morbidity patient male SUI candidate AUS insertion radiation . The result study provide clinician evidence superiority either ST TC AUS . Our null hypothesis difference outcome ( define ) AUS do TC vs. ST method . The alternative hypothesis one procedure inferior/superior . Primary endpoint : AUS revision removal surgery . These include surgery mechanical failure , cuff erosion , impend erosion ( discretion surgeon ) , urethral atrophy , urinary incontinence persistent retention due small cuff . Secondary endpoint : Rate post-operative urinary retention . Urinary retention define urinary catheter placement 5 day period AUS implantation AUS activation ( typically 4-8 week postoperatively ) Incontinence 3 month post-operatively measure use 24-hour pad weight test . Erectile function 3 month measure via Sexual Health Inventory Men ( SHIM ) Incontinence QoL impact 3 month measure Incontinence Severity Index ( ISI ) Incontinency Impact Questionnaire Short From ( IIQ-7 )</detailed_description>
