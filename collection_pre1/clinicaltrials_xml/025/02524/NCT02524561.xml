	<brief_summary>Combined estrogen progestin therapy show increase mammographic density incidence breast cancer randomize trial . The investigator propose examine effect commonly use low-dose combined hormone therapy ( HT ) regimens breast density , rate abnormal mammogram , circulate estrogen ongoing , already-funded Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study ( KEEPS ) . KEEPS randomize clinical trial primary goal examine effect low-dose transdermal versus oral estrogen combine cyclic micronized progesterone progression subclinical atherosclerosis recently menopausal woman . Prior study low-dose HT short duration small size . By determine effect low-dose hormone therapy breast , propose ancillary study add important information estimate balance risk benefit associate low-dose HT help guide future research trial .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Despite data clinical trial show increased risk breast cancer lack overall benefit primary prevention hormone therapy ( HT ) , still significant usage HT clinician woman treatment moderate-to-severe systemic menopausal symptom . Due possible increase risk preparation , current clinical recommendation advocate utilizing low dose shortest possible duration , average duration often 2-4 year . However , effect commonly use low-dose HT regimens breast density breast cancer risk unknown . Recent data intervention trial support long stand hypothesis hormonal effect breast cancer risk mediate breast density . The Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study ( KEEPS ) ongoing , already- fund randomized clinical trial primary goal examine effect 4 year low- dose transdermal versus oral estrogen combine cyclic micronized progesterone progression subclinical atherosclerosis recently menopausal woman . The propose ancillary study efficiently examine effect randomize low-dose HT key breast cancer surrogate endpoint : mammographic density rate abnormal mammogram . In parent KEEPS study , total 720 woman randomize oral conjugate equine estrogen ( 0.45 mg/d ) , transdermal 17-beta estradiol ( 50 mcg/d ) , placebo , cyclic micronized progesterone ( 200 mg 12 day ) active hormonal therapy group . All participant require mammography prior study entry well yearly follow-up ; blood sample also collect time point . Randomization complete 2008 . In ancillary study , aim collect mammogram eligible woman consent part ancillary study ( n=517 ) baseline , year 1 year 3 obtain process centrally calculate mammographic density . The investigator determine two low-dose HT regimen associate change mammographic density . The investigator also examine baseline mammographic density circulate biomarkers include estradiol , estrone , estrone sulfate , modify mediate change breast density HT . In addition , effect hormonal regimen rate abnormal mammogram biopsy determine . By determine effect low-dose combined HT breast , propose study add timely important information estimate balance risk benefit associate low-dose HT help guide future research .</detailed_description>
