	<brief_title>Bococizumab HIV Evaluation ( B-HIVE ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) due atherosclerosis continue lead single cause death industrialized country . High serum lipid level , especially high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) level , demonstrate strongly directly correlate CVD risk numerous epidemiological study . Moreover , large prospective clinical outcome trial demonstrate lower LDL-C decrease cardiovascular morbidity mortality ( 1 ) . A meta-analysis 26 randomized clinical trial comprise 170,000 participant show intensive statin therapy compare less intensive regimen reduce coronary death myocardial infarction additional 13 % ( 2 ) . HIV-infected individual represent unique increase subset atherosclerosis . With advent antiretroviral therapy , HIV-infected individual much improve survival face health issue relate age , include cardiovascular disease . Individuals HIV high rate coronary event compare control even set treat suppressed disease grow body literature suggest increase risk myocardial infarction , atherosclerosis , sudden cardiac death ( 3-5 ) . Many facet atherosclerosis differ HIV-infected individual compare uninfected individual atherosclerosis . HIV-infected patient acute coronary syndrome younger likely male smoker , low high density lipoprotein-cholesterol ( HDL-C ) , compare acute coronary syndrome patient ( 6 ) . With respect pathophysiology , viral replication , antiretroviral drug inflammation contribute atherosclerosis ( 7,8 ) . HIV-associated inflammation induces pro-atherogenic lipid abnormality anti-retroviral therapy lead development metabolic abnormality dyslipidemia , lipodystrophy insulin resistance ( 9,10 ) In large cross-sectional study , 27 % subject receive combination therapy include protease inhibitor total cholesterol level exceed 240 mg/dl , compare 8 % untreated HIV subject , 40 % triglyceride level 200 mg/dl , compare 15 % untreated subject ( 11 ) . The prevalence severity dyslipidemia varies among different antiretroviral drug ; ( 9 ) however , hypertriglyceridemia low HDL-cholesterol associate HIV infection even advent antiretroviral therapy ( 12 ) . Total , HDL-C , LDL-C decrease time HIV infection , antiretroviral treatment total LDL-C level increase pre-infection level HDL-C remain low ( 13 ) . Abnormalities body composition report 40-50 % HIV-infected patient , high rate receive combination antiretroviral therapy ( 9 ) . Subcutaneous lipoatrophy commonly affect face , limb , buttock , accompanied central fat accumulation . Hyperinsulinemia often also present . In representative study , ( 14 ) diabetes present 7 % HIV-infected adult fat accumulation lipoatrophy , compare 0.5 % control subject match age BMI . The corresponding rate glucose intolerance 35 % 5 % respectively ( 14 ) . Compared healthy control subject , HIV-infected men treat combination antiretroviral therapy 4 time likely develop diabetes 3-year observation period ( 15 ) . The increased cardiovascular risk dyslipidemia HIV-infected individual difficult treat several reason . Statins reduce LDL-C level less HIV-infected individual compare uninfected control ( 16 ) . Fibrates reduce triglyceride level less HIV-infected individual compare uninfected control well ( 16 ) . Drug-drug interaction statins protease inhibitor increase risk adverse event ( 17,18 ) . Due interaction , simvastatin lovastatin contraindicate among individual receive protease inhibitor dose atorvastatin exceed 40 mg ( 17 ) . Even interaction rosuvastatin , metabolize cytochrome P450 system , describe ( 19,20 ) . As consequence , physician may avoid treat HIV-infected individual would benefit statin , use low dos less potent statin , reduce potential cardiovascular event reduction . High triglyceride level HIV-infected subject common , combination fibrate plus antiretroviral therapy increase risk drug-drug adverse event , even consideration statin . Statin treatment reduces lipid level modestly HIV subject . Among 72 HIV-infected subject SATURN-HIV trial randomize rosuvastatin 10 mg/day , LDL-C reduce 25.3 % week 24 ( 21 ) . In another study , 83 HIV-infected subject , rosuvastatin 10 mg pravastatin 40 mg/day reduce LDL-C 37 % 19 % respectively 45 day ( 22 ) . Among 151 HIV-infected subject randomize rosuvastatin 10 mg , atorvastatin 10 mg , pravastatin 40 mg/day , LDL-C reduction great rosuvastatin dose , 3 statin significantly similarly reduce serum level hs-CRP TNF ( 23 ) . That statins might favorably influence evolution atherosclerosis HIV-infected subject suggest recent trial 40 HIV subject mild coronary atherosclerosis CT angiography aortic inflammation FDG-PET imaging randomize atorvastatin 20-40 mg/day placebo follow 12 month ( 24 ) . Atorvastatin significantly reduce non-calcified coronary plaque volume relative placebo , well number high-risk plaque . Approximately 1/3 individual HIV-infection co-infected hepatitis C ( 25 ) . Elevated hepatic enzyme due hepatitis C represent relative contraindication statin therapy , evidence suggests statin might increase hepatitis C activity ( 26 ) . Finally , HIV-infected patient often need many medication large daily pill burden . Compliance suffers , show improve single tablet regimen reduce daily pill load.27 Long-acting injectable antiretroviral drug development strategy reduce pill burden improve compliance ( 28 ) . PCSK9 inhibitor injection would dovetail well approach . For reason , PCSK9 inhibitor therapy offer advantage statin therapy unique population . Bococizumab ( RN316/PF-04950615 ) novel humanize PCSK9 monoclonal antibody . In 24-week , multicenter , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled phase II trial , LDL-C lower effect bococizumab , administer every 2 4 week statin-treated adult LDL-C ≥80 mg/dL assess ( 29 ) . Subjects randomize placebo , bococizumab 50 mg , 100 mg , 150 mg every 2 week , placebo , bococizumab 200 mg 300 mg monthly . The dose reduce LDL-C ≤25 mg/dL . The primary analysis placebo-adjusted treatment difference change baseline LDL-C week 12 . Overall , 354 patient randomize , 351 receive study treatment , 299 complete study . Bococizumab significantly reduce LDL-C across dos . The placebo-adjusted LDL-C reduction 12 week 2-weekly dose regimen 34.3 % 50 mg , 45.1 % 100 mg 53.4 % 150 mg , monthly dose regimen 27.6 % 200 mg 44.9 % 300 mg . The incidence profile adverse event similar across placebo bococizumab group . Based finding , 150 mg every 2 week select dose phase III trial , include trial . Because multiple dos bococizumab high 150 mg every 2 week 300 mg every 4 week 12 week safe well tolerate , primary rationale dose selection pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model predict LDL-C change baseline . Based population PK/PD modeling , dose 150 mg every 2 week patient background statin estimate equivalent approximately 80 % maximal response LDL-C lowering ( -67 % ) . Assuming average LDL C baseline 100 mg/dL HIV-infected individual , mean absolute LDL-C reduction predict approximately 60 mg/dL .</detailed_description>
