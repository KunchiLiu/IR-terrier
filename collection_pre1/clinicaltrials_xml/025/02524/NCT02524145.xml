	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine mechanism chronotropic incompetence ( inability increase heart rate exercise ) patient heart failure preserve ejection fraction ( HFpEF ) . The investigator test central command regulation cardiac beta-receptor sensitivity control heart rate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chronotropic Incompetence Patients With HFpEF</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>About half elderly patient diagnosis congestive heart failure apparently normal systolic function , call `` heart failure preserve ejection fraction '' HFpEF . To date , effective therapy HFpEF find , part failure discern key pathophysiologic pathway . Although HFpEF complex disease multiple pathophysiologic pathway lead phenotype heart failure , virtually propose mechanism involve impairment diastolic function - inability heart fill adequately low enough pressure avoid congestion physical activity exercise , prevent increase heart rate . A number study purport inability increase heart rate ( chronotropic incompetence ) responsible diminish exercise capacity . Alternatively , investigator hypothesize stiff , slowly relax heart patient HFpEF cause marked elevation pulmonary capillary pressure exercise lead premature fatigue prior achieve maximal heart rate , thus cause apparent `` chronotropic incompetence '' .</detailed_description>
