	<brief_title>Relationship Between Autonomic Central Nervous System Activation Atrial Fibrillation Using Functional MRI ( fMRI )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The central nervous system ( CNS ) consist brain spinal cord serve collection point nerve impulse . The peripheral nervous system ( PNS ) include nerve brain spinal cord connect part body CNS . The autonomic nervous system ( ANS ) , consist mostly motor nerve , control function involuntary smooth muscle , gland , cardiac muscle . The ANS divide sympathetic parasympathetic system . In relation heart , sympathetic system control increase heart rate , blood pressure , cardiac output . The parasympathetic system lower heart activity operate normal situation body stress1 , 2 . While influence central nervous system cardiac rhythm function well accept , mechanism control poorly understand . A preponderance data implicates autonomic nervous system development many case atrial fibrillation ( AF ) 3 , 4 . The importance investigate role central nervous system control heart rhythm appreciate review prevalence cardiac arrhythmia . AF alone affect 2.2 million adult United States . With grow age population , number expect rise 5.6-10 million year 2050 . AF contributes development heart failure stroke precipitate angina patient . New therapy need since surgical minimally invasive ablative technique associate substantial failure rate addition complication invasive procedure . Understanding CNS 's role promise direct new therapy improve treatment success reduce complication associate therapy AF arrhythmia . Direct current ( DC ) cardioversion ( DCCV ) procedure synchronize electrical shock deliver chest heart via electrode apply skin chest back . Most elective cardioversion procedure perform treat AF atrial flutter ( AFL ) . The shock cause heart cell contract simultaneously , thereby interrupt terminate abnormal electrical rhythm AF without damage heart . This interruption abnormal beat allow electrical system heart regain control restore normal sinus rhythm ( see Figure 1 , Appendix A ) . Since shock painful , patient usually sedate . Once sedate , physician charge defibrillator specify energy level delivers shock . Additional shock higher energy level deliver first attempt restore sinus rhythm . Typically patient able go home hour procedure . DCCV restore normal sinus rhythm 90 % patients5 . Newer MRI technique offer ability image anatomy , also assess brain activation pattern . Functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) develop early 1990s , variation magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . The primary purpose fMRI observe brain function vary stimuli non-invasive way . fMRI use conventional MRI scanner . It take advantage magnetic property iron blood . Whenever part brain become active , small blood vessel localize region dilate , cause blood rush region brain . The blood 's iron atom cause small distortion magnetic field around , cause MRI scanner able read display image brain 's activity . When region brain activate , large amount freshly oxygenate blood pours structure brain , thus cause small change magnetic field , produce MRI signal active region6 . Prior study utilized heart rate variation galvanic skin response independent measure autonomic arousal compare measure fMRI determine region brain active sympathetic parasympathetic arousal 7-11 . Studies typically identify activation within anterior cingulate region insular cortex sympathetic activation ventral anterior cingulate parasympathetic activation12 , 13 . Moreover , attenuation parasympathetic myocardial innervation myocardial fat pad ablation parasympathetic ganglionic plexi show suppress AF significant number patient present arrhythmia14 , 15 . Whether attenuation central autonomic pathway play role initiate AF , atrial arrhythmia may lead central attenuation open question . This study aim define effect AF central autonomic pathway vise versa . Our expectation end study , great insight role central nervous system specifically autonomic nervous system modulate AF . We expect understand interaction central nervous system cardiac arrhythmias lead development novel therapy preserve restore normal sinus rhythm . This study serve pilot study goal obtain additional grant funding expand study difference volume activation demonstrate .</detailed_description>
