	<brief_summary>The main objective study : 1 . To investigate three novel , non-invasive ocular measurement cross-sectional study participant various neurodegenerative dementia standard cognitive assessment brain imaging measure ; 2 . To assess potential utility ocular assessment early detection pre-dementia , i.e . so-called Mild Cognitive Impairment ( MCI ) stage .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hypotheses : 1 . Retinal correlation neurodegeneration : ) Retinal nerve fiber layer ( RNFL ) pattern differ subject MCI early stage LBD spectrum , AD , VCI , relative normal elder . ) RNFL thin around optic disc macular thin correlate hippocampal atrophy cortical thickness signature MCI AD . ii ) If detect disorder , RNFL thin also correlate topographical AD pattern atrophy . iii ) Retinal cortical thinning correlate brain amyloid PET . iv ) Selective peripapillary RNFL thin superior inferior quadrant describe MCI/milder AD case correlate precuneus lingual gyrus cortical thinning respectively . b ) Retinal artery narrow correlate presence covert lacunar infarct retinal venular widening moderate severe periventricular white matter hyperintensities . 2 . AD-linked Aβ-related pathology evident ocular lens MCI-AD subject case associate brain amyloidosis ( i.e . subset LBD spectrum VCI ) , confirm amyloid PET imaging . Design : This three-year cross-sectional rater-blinded observational study consist 30 month enrolment period follow six month data clean analysis . Three hundred twenty ( 320 ) subject normal cognition , MCI , AD , LBD spectrum , subcortical VCI recruit five memory clinic partner Toronto Dementia Research Alliance ( TDRA ) University Toronto movement disorder stroke prevention clinic . All patient involve study undergo SD-OCT FLES ocular assessment , eye tracking , gait balance assessment , blood draw genomics fluid biomarkers , neuropsychological assessment , brain MRI brain amyloid PET . A subset undergo SV-OCT. Study Procedures Overview The study procedure list recommend order assessment may perform sequence ( specific exception describe ) . Multiple assessment may perform day participant convenience . All study procedure complete within 3 month screen , exception FLES , may complete within 6 month screen necessary . Screening Visit . Consent . The study explain write informed consent participation obtain patient his/her substitute decision maker participant 's study partner ( applicable ) . Screening . The general disease-specific inclusion exclusion criterion assess . The LEAP-Q questionnaire administer assess language history English proficiency . If MMSE and/or MoCA administer within past three month , administer screen visit . Information patient 's concomitant medication , medical , surgical , ophthalmological history family health history collect , well information patient 's study partner 's demographic . The patient 's correct near visual acuity check use handheld pocket size Snellen eye chart . Auditory acuity various frequency assess use audiometer . Fasting blood drawn analysis HbA1c , CBC , electrolytes , creatinine , urea , lipid profile , glucose , liver function ( AST , ALT , ALP , bilirubin ) , homocysteine , B12 TSH . Blood also draw genomics fluid biomarkers . Genomics Fluid Biomarkers . Blood sample genetic test include apoliprotein E4 status , well proteomic , lipidomic fluid biomarkers neurodegeneration vascular disease , collect participant . All sample take 10 hour fast ; possible , participant light meal . Samples collect 8am 10am , order minimize circadian variation biomarker level . Neuropsychological Battery Questionnaires . A comprehensive neurocognitive battery ( three four hour long , depend participant 's level impairment ) administer morning . Where possible , FLES ointment administer afternoon visit ( see ) . In application ointment , mood , behaviour functional questionnaire administer participant caregiver . If FLES ointment apply , questionnaire administer follow neuropsychological battery . This assessment may take place several day necessary , exceed two week start end . ( Note : In order ass whether normal control participant meet inclusion criterion normal score study neuropsychological battery , participant must cognitive assessment first step screening . If score within normal limit , proceed rest study assessment . ) SD-OCT Kensington Eye Institute . Assessments meet ocular criterion include visual acuity , intra-ocular pressure ( IOP ) measurement non-mydriatic fundus camera recording , perform certified ophthalmic technician . This help rule glaucoma age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) . If pathology find , patient undergo SD-OCT determine retinal nerve fiber layer thickness . FLES Ointment . The FLES ointment administer afternoon day FLES procedure . It administer three time one participant 's eye , two hour break application . It may schedule afternoon follow neuropsychological test different assessment , independent assessment . FLES Kensington Eye Institute . This assessment schedule morning application FLES ointment combine SD-OCT assessment possible . The measurement session consist 5 scan take approximately 10 minute . Neurological Exam . Vital sign measure neurological examination perform . Gait Balance . Information aid use balance collect use questionnaire . Participants ' leg length , calf circumference , height , weight measure record . Standing balance assess four condition use force plate measure sway . Gait assess three block participant wear hip ankle accelerometer , vertical transition assess use sit-to-stand procedure force plat accelerometer . These assessment take one hour complete . Participants unable complete assessment allow continue participation study . Eye Tracking . Participants ask look computer monitor perform three set task ( pro-saccade , anti-saccade , dynamic free viewing ) specialize camera track record eye movement . Participants unable complete assessment allow continue participation study . SV-OCT Sunnybrook . SV-OCT do subsamples high SVD vs. minimal SVD load study MRI previous clinical MRI CT. MRI . Participants undergo one hour 3T quantitative research MRI protocol include structural , diffusion tensor imaging , rest state fMRI . Amyloid PET . Participants undergo brain amyloid PET scan use 18F-Flutemetamol .</detailed_description>
