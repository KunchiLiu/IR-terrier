	<brief_summary>The medical field begin adopt treatment alter individual 's microbiome improve patient health ; however , approach adopt treatment low urinary tract symptom ( LUTS ) . Here , investigator propose first step development therapy . If investigator hypothesis correct , investigator could change first line treatment hypoestrogenic woman develop future therapy modulate bacteria bladder improve LUTS also treatment response . This could lead first treatment low urinary disorder incorporate person 's individual microbiome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Estrogen Impact Overactive Bladder Syndrome : Female Pelvic Floor Microbiomes Antimicrobial Peptides</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Overactive bladder ( OAB ) syndrome characterized symptom complex urinary urgency , usually associate frequency nocturia , without urgency urinary incontinence absence infection pathology . Vaginal estrogen , well-documented treatment OAB hypoestrogenic woman , show improve symptom frequency , urgency urgency urinary incontinence ( UUI ) . Several theory propose explain mechanism underlie estrogen 's effect lower urinary tract symptom ( LUTS ) . Investigators propose estrogen treatment influence bacterial community ( microbiomes ) vagina bladder alters urothelial vaginal ( AMPs ) ; thereby improve OAB symptom hypoestrogenic woman . Long-standing medical dogma replace clear evidence female urinary microbiome ( FUM ) exists.This suggest FUM factor lower urinary tract symptom ( LUTS ) FUM diversity contribute LUTS treatment response , like vaginal microbiome contribution vaginal symptom . In hypoestrogenic woman , vaginal microbiome shift low diversity community , commonly dominate Lactobacillus , diverse community dominate anaerobes ; change reverse estrogen treatment . Since FUM woman OAB include bacteria similar vaginal microbiome ( e.g . Lactobacillus , Gardnerella , diverse anaerobe ) , investigator reason FUM would respond similarly estrogen become less diverse . While almost nothing known urinary/vaginal microbiome interplay , even less know immune response modulation bladder vagina . However , estrogen reduces subsequent urinary tract infection ( UTI ) rate hypoestrogenic woman affect recurrent UTI , estrogen induces urothelial antimicrobial peptide ( AMP ) expression . Since AMPs exhibit microbicidal activity , stimulate inflammation , facilitate epithelial barrier homeostasis , estrogen may work AMPs mediator optimize microbial equilibrium .</detailed_description>
