	<brief_summary>Countless study perform quantify severity heart disease influence respiratory system , check heart condition surgical process determine pulmonary complication , one common cause morbidity mortality postoperative period cardiac surgery . After surgical procedure , reduction residual volume ( RV ) , total lung capacity ( TLC ) , vital capacity ( VC ) functional residual capacity ( FRC ) , lead formation atelectasis , alteration ventilation-perfusion ( V / Q ) , partial pressure carbon dioxide arterial blood ( PaCO2 ) partial pressure oxygen arterial blood ( PaO 2 ) . Pulmonary function impair postoperative period cardiac surgery , due various factor common major surgery drive patient develop respiratory complication atelectasis pneumonia . Physical therapy play important role treatment patient undergoing cardiac surgery , preoperative period postoperative , order prevent minimize respiratory complication . Follow-up study cardiac rehabilitation quantify quality activity necessary ensure patient heart disease patient best physical , mental social condition consequently able , effort regain normal position community lead active productive life time , therefore , clinical change result extensive cardiac surgery already highly dedicate described literature daily life factor rehabilitation intervention patient take late postoperative period really assist complete recovery inclusion society still well elucidate , appropriate carry project due fact expose . The project develop whose main justification clarify issue related return preservation individual feature undergoes extensive cardiac procedure , well incidence mortality 12 month procedure . The current literature express clearly , possible impact functionality return daily activity individual late postoperative period , since malfunction immediate post operative period already fully understood .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Will hold period August November 2015 , quantitative descriptive transversal study patient late postoperative period underwent cardiac surgery hospital medium complexity state sao paulo , Brazil period one year procedure . Patients recruit via contact phone attend place certain pre schedule time carry assessment relevant study . Evaluations shall perform hospital predetermine track , sun accompany examiner . All individual properly orient participate activity sign informed consent ( Informed Consent Informed ) . Will hold primarily refers report card progress retroactive filled student physiotherapy course evaluate functional condition respiratory muscle strength individual include study time hospital discharge cardiac surgical post ( last year ) . The purpose consultation record determine functional clinical characteristic individual soon surgery corroborate result test patient one year participant ' surgery well able quantify influence number situation occur life individual may modify way current situation clinical social thereof . These evaluation sheet file physiotherapy clinic . After consult retroactive chip , full interview hold participant , assess quality life specific score ( SF-36 ) , evaluation daily living habit , social life , work life , independence , recurrent admission participation period rehabilitation program cease habit like smoking , drink physical inactivity . The clinical trial conduct : quantification inspiratory expiratory muscle strength determination maximal inspiratory pressure ( MIP . ) And maximal expiratory pressure ( MEP . ) Using device measure submaximal functional test application Walk Test 6 minute ( TC6 ` ) . The patient take track traveled test hemodynamic data collect rest , test : blood pressure , heart rate , oxygen saturation . The patient instruct walk fast without run , recommend American ThoracicSociety , track 30 meter , mark every 3 meter , turn point . By complete six minute , patient stop immediately . In way measure total distance cover patient variable time arrest . The parameter check whole test note , distance travel meter . At end quantification clinical epidemiological data , previous history current data comparison make order determine physical functional characteristic patient monitor late postoperative period .</detailed_description>
