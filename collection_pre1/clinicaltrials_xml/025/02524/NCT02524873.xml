	<detailed_description>2.1 Study Design Protocol Overview This post-hoc association study patient diagnose high blood pressure stable medication treatment least 6 month . The purpose study evaluate relationship optimal medication therapy ( therapy result stable blood pressure particular patient ) predict optimal medication therapy base patient 's genetic profile . Chart review patient 's history antihypertensive therapy couple buccal swab blood pressure reading collect eligible patient provide informed consent . The swab analyze fourteen genetic variant associate antihypertensive therapy response ( efficacy , side-effects ) . 2.2 Study Objective To assess relationship drug therapy class/combination therapy class result best blood pressure control patient vs. Geneticure high blood pressure panel would predict . 2.3 Secondary Objectives - To assess clinical time achieve optimal blood pressure treatment . - To assess number office visit require achieve optimal blood pressure treatment .</detailed_description>
