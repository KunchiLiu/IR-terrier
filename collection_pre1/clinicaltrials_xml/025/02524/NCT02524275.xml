	<brief_title>Docetaxel Capecitabine Treating Patients With Recurrent Metastatic Squamous Cell Carcinoma Head Neck</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate phase II study efficacy ( radiographic assessment disease status 2 cycle therapy ) combination docetaxel capecitabine subject advance squamous cell carcinoma head neck candidate surgery radiation therapy . II . To evaluate safety toxicity docetaxel capecitabine subject advance squamous cell carcinoma head neck . III . To descriptively examine effect combination docetaxel capecitabine quality life subject advance squamous cell carcinoma head neck . OUTLINE : Patients receive docetaxel intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour day 1 capecitabine orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-14 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day periodically thereafter .</detailed_description>
