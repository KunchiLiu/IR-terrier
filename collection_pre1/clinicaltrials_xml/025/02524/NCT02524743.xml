	<brief_title>The Prevention Pain Associated With Rocuronium Injection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study conduct 150 patient age 18- 70 year ASA ( American Society Anesthesiologists ) physical status I- II undergo various elective operation . None patient premedicated operation . The patient monitor three derivation electrocardiogram , non- invasive arterial pressure , pulse oximeter . A 20-gauge catheter insert superficial vein dorsum patient 's non- dominant hand . The lactated Ringer 's solution infuse 100 ml/h five minute , The infusion stop arm IV line elevate 15 second gravity drainage venous blood , The venous drainage occlude 120 second use rubber tourniquet upper arm patient pretreated either lidocaine ( 20 mg 40 mg IV ) acetaminophen ( 50mg 25 mg IV ) injection rocuronium . Some patient receive 5 ml normal saline . The patient randomly assign five group . For pretreatment patient administer 5 ml normal saline Group I ( Control ) ; acetaminophen 50mg Group II , acetaminophen 25 mg Group III , lidocaine 20 mg Group IV lidocaine 40mg Group V , dilute 5 mL saline IV . The occlusion release 120 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium 1 % injected IV 5 second . During injection rocuronium , pain grade four point scale ( TEST 1 ) withdrawal movement evaluate ( TEST 2 ) study-blinded investigator . Twenty second administration rocuronium , 5 mg/kg thiopental administer IV . After orotracheal intubation , anesthesia continue sevofluorane 40 % oxygen 60 % air . Twenty-four hour operation , injection site check complication , pain ( absent/ present ) , swell allergic reaction anesthesiologist know drug administer . Table 1 : Four Point Scala ( TEST 1 ) Degree pain Response Pain score 1 . None : Negative response questioning : 0 2 . Mild : Pain report response questioning , without behavioral sign : 1 3 . Moderate : Pain report response question accompanied behavioral sign , pain report spontaneously without question : 2 4 . Severe : Strong vocal response response accompany facial grimacing , arm withdrawal , tear : 3 Table 2 : Evaluation Of Withdrawal Movements During Rocuronium Injection ( TEST2 ) Pain Score Response 1 . No response 2 . Movement wrist 3 . Movement/ withdrawal involve arm ( elbow/ shoulder ) 4 . Generalized response ( movement/ withdrawal one extremity , cough breath hold )</detailed_description>
