	<brief_summary>Bone marrow biopsy frequently perform procedure diagnose evaluate hematologic disease . It estimate 700,000 bone marrow procedure ( BMP 's ) perform annually U.S . Most performed practicing hematologists/oncologists office hospital . However , significant number perform hematologists-in-training ( H-I-T 's ) teaching hospital . However , incidence complication associate bone marrow biopsy largely unknown . This study two goal : 1 . The first goal objectively determine CT clinical assessment , actual risk patient bone marrow biopsy rate pelvic injury unselected group hematology patient require bone marrow biopsy , perform hematologist-in-training . 2 . The second goal determine quality bone marrow biopsy obtain , use lateral angulation technique .</brief_summary>
