	<brief_title>Biofeedback Gait Retraining Reduce Lower Extremity Impact Obese Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study include approximately 50 patient , age 7-12 year . All participant parent sign inform consent form enter study . At begin , participant ask answer `` vas scale '' questionnaire pain . Participants recruit population overweight child child 's sport medical center 'Meir ' Kfar Saba . In first stage participant divide randomly two group intervention control . All child take test 1 km instruct walk maximum phase run ( maximum child go without run ) calculate determine rate 1.0 assessment intervention program participant . In addition , measure knee ( valgus ) make Goniometer , protractor measure angle bone precise angle . Each participant fill questionnaire pain difficulty suffers knee . Participants describe researcher degree pain / discomfort motion ( walk , run ) pas physical examination diagnose knee injury . The intervention program take four week week two exercise session total 8 session . Each session length 9 minute . Each session include continuous exercise patient walking , walk pace run ( 3 minute section ) . During meeting , participant receive biofeedback display computer screen show force develop knee joint patient see graphically force develop around knee joint guide / try reduce value graph change intensity land track ( guide land `` light '' , `` soft '' land small noise ) . In training time biofeedback show reduce . The control group receive train program without provide biofeedback . Each participant perform test personality shoe . At end intervention program statistical comparative test GRF develop knee Relative child Vs original GRF group average .</detailed_description>
