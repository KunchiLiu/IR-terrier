PHEDRE ( Pharmacodépendance Et DREpanocytose-drug dependence sickle-cell disease ) observational , descriptive transversal study . Patients age 26 sickle-cell disease include study doctor look sickle-cell disease centre . The patient contact trained researcher telephone interview , include evaluation Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders criterion abuse dependence equimolar mixture oxygen nitrous oxide analgesic drug take patient . The data also complete use subject 's medical record . This study make possible provide initial quantitative qualitative evaluation problematic use equimolar mixture oxygen nitrous oxide analgesic drug sickle-cell disease population . The result use firstly provide additional data essential monitoring risk overdose , abuse , dependence misuse product , begin awareness-raising provide information health care professional , order significantly improve management sickle-cell disease-related pain .</brief_summary>
