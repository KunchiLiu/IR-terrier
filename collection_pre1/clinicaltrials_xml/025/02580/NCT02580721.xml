	<brief_summary>Crestal bone soft tissue stability around implant important issue implant dentistry . Initial vertical mucosal tissue thickness show one factor impact bone stability . However , lack data literature regard relationship mucosal thickness marginal bone loss around implant . Berglundh Lindhe animal study report thin mucosal tissue cause significantly crestal bone resorption around implant . In addition , clinical research regard effect tissue thickness bone soft tissue stability around implant lack . The aim clinical study evaluate influence mucosal tissue thickness soft hard tissue change around implant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Influence Mucosal Tissue Thickness Soft Hard Tissue Changes Around Implants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective clinical study ; - evaluate influence mucosal tissue thickness periimplant soft hard tissue change . - evaluate whether acellular dermal matrix ( ADM ) derive allogenic membrane subepithelial connective tissue graft perform implant placement could effective vertical soft tissue augmentation . - evaluate influence vertical soft tissue augmentation acellular dermal matrix subepithelial connective tissue graft soft hard tissue change around implant platform switch 1 year loading . Partially edentulous patient posterior low jaw area require implant treatment recruit study . There four group study 35 patient group . Inclusion criterion ; ( 1 ) &gt; 18 year age ; ( 2 ) medical contraindication implant surgery ; ( 3 ) miss teeth posterior mandibular area require two implant support three unit bridge prosthetic restoration ; ( 4 ) fully heal bone site ( least 3 month extraction ) ( 5 ) minimum 6mm bone width 10 mm bone height inferior alveolar canal ; ( 6 ) healthy soft tissue ; ( 7 ) minimum 2mm keratinize gingiva ; ( 8 ) bone augmentation procedure implant placement . The patient exclude meet inclusion criterion additionally ( 1 ) poor oral hygiene ; ( 2 ) uncontrolled periodontitis ( 3 ) smoke Ethical approval take Cukurova University Ethical Committee patient sign inform consent form participate study . Cone beam computerize tomography take patient order evaluate future implant site . Patients enrol fulfill inclusion criterion . Patients exclude meet inclusion criterion additionally exclusion criterion . Two implant per patient place . The prosthetic restoration perform three unit bridge two support implant . These two implant premolar molar region include study evaluate independently . One hour prior surgery patient receive prophylactic dose 1 g amoxicillin+clavulanic acid . All surgical procedure perform two experienced surgeon local anesthesia . A mid-crestal incision center edentulous ridge perform , leave least width 2 mm keratinize tissue buccally . Next , full-thickness buccal flap raise , lingual part elevate ensure direct visibility . Vertical thickness soft tissue measure 1.0 mm mark periodontal probe . The probe position upright position bone crest center future implant placement . After measurement , lingual flap raise completely expose implantation site . If vertical soft tissue thickness 2 mm less , tissue consider thin . If soft tissue thickness 2mm , tissue consider thick . There four group study . Group 1 : implant place naturally thick tissue ( &gt; 2mm ) ( control group ) . Group 2 : implant place thin tissue ( ≤2mm ) Group 3 : vertical soft tissue augmentation thin tissue ( ≤2mm ) subepithelial connective tissue graft ( SCTG ) simultaneously implant placement . Group 4 : vertical soft tissue augmentation thin tissue ( ≤2mm ) AlloDerm® Regenerative Tissue Matrix simultaneously implant placement . Implants platform switch ( Astra Tech Implant System EV ) place cover screw insert . In group 3 , vertical soft tissue augmentation perform SCTG . In group 4 , AlloDerm® RTM , Thick 1 x 4 cm use accord manufacturer 's recommendation vertical soft tissue augmentation . The flap close primarily 4/0 suture group . Patients instructed rinse operate site antiseptic mouthwash twice day prescribe 1 g amoxicillin+clavulanic acid twice day week . For pain control , patient receive 500 mg flurbiprofen need . The suture remove 7-10 day surgery . After 3 month heal second stage surgery schedule local anesthesia . A mid-crestal incision perform center bone crest . A full-thickness buccal flap raise , thickness augment soft tissue center implant measure periodontal probe . After raise lingual flap Astra Tech heal uni EV connect implant . Flap close suture suture remove 7 day surgery . After 14 day heal Astra Tech uni abutment EV connect implant abjutment disconnection perform order avoid disruption peri-implant seal abutment unscrewing . Screw retain fix prosthesis metal ceramic restoration connect implant 6 week heal . Plaque Index ( PI ) , Gingival Index ( GI ) , Probing Pocket Depth ( PPD ) , Bleeding Probing ( BOP ) , evaluate prosthetic delivery , 6 month 12 month load . Radiological evaluation measurement perform calculate mesial distal crestal bone change around implant . Intraoral digital radiograph use parallel technique take patient ( ) implant placement , ( ii ) 3 month heal , ( iii ) prosthetic delivery , ( iv ) 6 ( v ) 12 month load . The measurement perform use Image J analysis software program ( Image J version 1.44-National Institutes Health , NIH ) examiner unaware group assignment . The intra-examiner agreement determine second third measurement 1- month interval . The mean difference measurement calculate mean three measurement use . A total 280 implant 140 patient 35 patient group include study accord result power analysis . Finally , patient base study design . Data analyze use SPSS 21.0 ( Chicago , IL , USA ) . Descriptive statistic calculate measurement mean , SEs , SDs , median , range measurement . The normality distribution test use Kolmogorov Smirnov ( P=0.05 ) . One-way ANOVA follow Tukey HSD test use compare group mean . As alternative , Kruskal Wallis H test follow Mann Whitney U test use case nonparametric analysis need .</detailed_description>
