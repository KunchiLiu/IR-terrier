	<brief_title>Prospective Post-Market Data Collection Patients With Knee OA Treated With nSTRIDE APS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clinical trial , general , formally demonstrate effectiveness safety various autologous therapy treatment knee OA . Differences process autologous therapy yield substantial difference result output . It appear safety autologous therapy roughly equivalent across different processing method . However , make generalization regard effectiveness across autologous therapy complicate . Thus , autologous therapy require independent efficacy evaluation . nSTRIDE APS show decrease pain , increase function favorable safety profile small pilot trial . However , demonstration treatment effect heterogeneous population lack . Further , neither effect time course utility multiple injection document . This study allow low burden , efficient data collection large heterogeneous population person suffer knee OA . The study document treatment effect timeline treatment effect nSTRIDE APS follow single repeat injection .</detailed_description>
