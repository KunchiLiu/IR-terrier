	<brief_summary>This study evaluate safety efficacy EBV-specific T-cell line treat patient suffer high EBV viral titer respond standard care therapy treat EBV-related lymphoma . The study recruit 6 patient receive autologous T cell T cell line derive patient 's allogeneic donor ( case stem cell transplant recipient ) , 6 patient receive T-cell line prepare match partially match relate donor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Safety Efficacy EBV Specific T-cell Lines</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) member herpes virus family infect 95 % individual lifetime . Most initial infection occur childhood brief flu-like illness , virus enters phase latency . Patients receive bone marrow transplant organ transplant take medication drug weaken immune system . In context , virus `` reactivate '' cause serious problem , lymphoma . For unknown reason , people normal immune system also develop lymphoma due EBV . The purpose study test safety efficacy immune cell ( T lymphocytes ) specifically `` taught '' recognize virus-infected cell eliminate . This `` education '' occur do 2 week period ( approximately ) , research laboratory . The cell transfuse patient .</detailed_description>
