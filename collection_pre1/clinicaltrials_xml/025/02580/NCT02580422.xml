	<brief_summary>Cachexia systemic catabolic syndrome apparent effect skeletal muscle , tolerance chemotherapy , early toxicity quality life ; however , effect cardiopulmonary function well understood . Preclinical study demonstrate diaphragmatic muscle wasting ( 29 ) leave ventricular waste fibrosis associate mouse cachexia model . ( 40 ) Many patient , experience cancer cachexia , describe generalize debility sense breathlessness ( 41 ) despite adequate oxygenation peripheral blood measure pulse oximetry . Whether relate deconditioning associate chemotherapy relate direct effect cardiac diaphragmatic muscle remain unknown . In pilot study , investigator propose perform preliminary evaluation cardiopulmonary function patient pancreatic cancer , likely develop cachexia , assess feasibility perform large prospective study understand impact cancer cachexia cardiopulmonary function . This pilot study provide foundation potentially identify cachexia early stage ( pre-cachexia ) develop pharmacological exercise base intervention prevent delay progression . Based clinical experience publish literature , expect 60-70 % patient &gt; 10 % weight loss course disease . More commonly , associate clinical radiographic disease progression , certainly happen throughout course disease even without disease progression .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Project Cardiopulmonary Functional Evaluation Patients With Pancreatic Cancer Associated Cachexia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective : To assess feasibility perform prospective cardiopulmonary physical function assessment patient advance pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( PDAC ) expect develop cachexia . Secondary Objectives : 1 . To measure change maximal expiratory pressure ( MEP ) maximal inspiratory pressure ( MIP ) patient progressive PDAC and/or cancer associate cachexia 2 . To measure change strain echocardiography patient progressive PDAC and/or cancer associate cachexia 3 . To assess functional change patient progressive PDAC and/or cancer associate cachexia 4 . To assess body composition change associate cachexia disease progression 5 . To measure level cytokines peripheral blood patient cachexia Procedures : All study procedures do two time point ( T1=baseline study entry , T2=at disease progression development cachexia ) . Patients undergo echocardiography strain evaluation Indiana University Health Echocardiography Laboratory pulmonary function test per institutional guideline IUH PFT laboratory University Hospital . Patients also 20mL ( 2 red top tube ) blood drawn study outline Section 7.5 . Standard care labs take patient 's medical record . Patients also evaluate use three standardized functional assessment tool commonly utilized physical rehabilitation : 1 ) 5 Times Sit-to-Stand Test ; 2 ) 6 Minute Walk Test ; 3 ) grip dynamometry . Standard care CT scan obtain time tumor assessment enable investigator ass body muscle mass describe Section 7.4 . In addition , investigator administer three standardized survey tool assess quality life prior level function : 1 ) The Short Form 36 ( SF-36 ) ; 2 ) Lower Extremity Functional Scale ( LEFS ) ; 3 ) Scored Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment ( PG-SGA ) . Sample Size : Due risk clinical deterioration drop study inability undergo T2 evaluation , investigator plan enrol 133 % desired number subject , account 33 % miss T2 data . This likely high number ; however , enable data collection 12-15 patient time point propose test .</detailed_description>
