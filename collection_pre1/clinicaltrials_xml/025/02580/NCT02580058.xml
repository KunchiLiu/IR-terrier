Platinum resistant/refractory disease , define disease progression within 180 day follow last administered dose platinum therapy ( resistant ) , lack response disease progression receive recent platinum base therapy ( refractory ) , respectively . Received 3 line systemic anticancer therapy platinum sensitive disease , recently platinum containing , prior systemic therapy platinum resistant disease Measurable disease investigator assessment least 1 unidimensional measurable lesion RECIST v.1.1 previously irradiate Active autoimmune disease might deteriorate receive immunostimulatory agent . Patients diabetes type I , vitiligo , psoriasis , hypo hyperthyroid disease require immunosuppressive treatment eligible . Mandatory tumor biopsy must perform prior enrollment patient ( unless document clinical contraindication ) . In addition , availability archive FFPE tumor tissue confirm . If patient underwent tumor tissue collection within 3 month prior enrollment intervene treatment , sample provide , new de novo tumor biopsy require . Non epithelial tumor ovarian tumor low malignant potential ( ie , borderline tumor ) . Prior therapy anti PD 1 , anti PD L1 , anti PD L2 , anti CD137 , anti cytotoxic T lymphocyte associate antigen 4 ( CTLA 4 ) antibody ( include ipilimumab , tremelimumab antibody drug specifically target T cell co stimulation immune checkpoint pathway ) .
