	<brief_summary>Current guideline diagnosis management patient stable coronary artery disease ( CAD ) strongly support performance non-invasive imaging technique detection myocardial ischemia prior revascularization procedure . This recommendation originate strong evidence base show lack prognostic benefit percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) optimal medical therapy patient without verification myocardial ischemia . On hand , could demonstrate patient functionally significant coronary artery stenoses benefit revascularization . Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ( CMR ) emerge diagnostic modality choice detection myocardial ischemia high sensitivity specificity . The investigator therefore design prospective randomize trial compare CMR-driven vs. angiography-driven management patient stable CAD concern major cardiac endpoint , futile angiography quality life .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Current guideline diagnosis management patient stable coronary artery disease ( CAD ) recommend - besides thorough history physical examination - proper risk stratification prior invasive therapy . The detection exclusion moderate severe reversible myocardial ischemia crucial part work-up process designate patient high-risk group ischemia present . This special interest , several observational study show prognostic benefit revascularization depend amount myocardial ischemia . Moreover , patient without ischemia seem benefit revascularization optimal medical therapy . This emphasize need functional test prior therapeutic decision . Invasive coronary angiography still consider `` gold-standard '' diagnosis CAD , though exhibits several limitation shortcoming . Multiple study document significant interobserver variability grade coronary artery stenosis , well frequent occurrence under- overestimation hemodynamic relevance . One conclude coronary angiography may provide anatomical information modality choice concern detection myocardial ischemia . Moreover , study randomized patient stable CAD either catheterization catheterization yet , exist high-quality evidence would support performance diagnostic coronary angiography majority case stable CAD . This special interest , report frequency complication due diagnostic coronary angiography 1.5 % . Nevertheless , coronary angiography remain often perform diagnostic test setting , one-half elective percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) do without previous stress-testing . Adenosine perfusion cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ( CMR ) image modality provide anatomical functional information one single examination . With ability reliably detect reversible myocardial ischemia , play increase role diagnosis risk stratification patient suspect known CAD . Though CMR therefore highly recommended diagnostic work-up set stable CAD , study exists would evaluate CMR driven approach patient management regard occurrence major cardiac event , quality life safety endpoint . Objective study show CMR base conservative invasive management patient suspect known CAD inferior regard major cardiac endpoint quality life comparison - conventional - coronary angiography base approach . The investigator assume significant number diagnostic coronary angiography PCIs thus could spar without decrease patient safety comfort .</detailed_description>
