	<brief_summary>Background : Patient-reported outcome measure ( PROMs ) provide validate evidence health quality life ( QoL ) patient perspective . Several national PROMs programme implement National Health Service - specifically common elective procedure . Local implementation vary across setting population . The incidence non-melanoma skin cancer ( NMSC ) rapidly increase , pose considerable burden UK healthcare resource , yet limited evidence use PROMs NMSC little information patient ' perceive health QoL . Objectives : This study explore feasibility implement skin cancer-specific PROM - Skin Cancer Quality Life Impact Tool ( SCQOLIT ) NMSC . Methods : Three hundred patient pathological diagnosis NMSC undergoing treatment modality recruit complete SCQOLIT questionnaire baseline , 3 , 6 9 month . Participation response rate , miss data individual change score analyse . Staff patient interview explore acceptability feasibility collect PROMs data . Results : Interim result project date present . Feasibility assess evaluate number eligible patient , number consenting patient , reason consent participant number . Individual longitudinal change score , response rate psychometric property SCQOLIT report . Implications : Acceptability feasibility SCQOLIT tool never rigorously assessed Dermatology clinic . A validated NMSC-specific PROM would help standardize multi-centred trial , allow robust evaluation quality care appropriately direct healthcare resource improve QoL patient NMSC .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Skin cancer rapidly increase cancer type fair-skinned population worldwide . Although non-melanoma skin cancer ( NMSC ) rarely life threatening , disease treatment associate substantial morbidity confer significant financial burden National Health Service ( NHS ) . Consequently , British Association Dermatologists ( BAD ) commission Patient-reported Outcomes Measurement Group , Oxford review evidence PROMs skin cancer . The author conclude cancer-specific quality life ( QOL ) questionnaires appeared sensitive generic PROMs e.g . Dermatology Life Quality Index ( DLQI ) , capture relevant QOL issue . In NMSC population , issue include scar , disfigurement , anxiety fear future skin cancer . One skin cancer-specific PROM evaluate Skin Cancer Quality Life Impact Tool ( SCQOLIT ) . The SCQOLIT ten-item instrument develop specifically patient non-metastatic skin cancer , demonstrate evidence favour reproducibility , validity , internal consistency require evaluation . The decision evaluate SCQOLIT study , include similarity overall format brevity DLQI PROM widely use routine medical dermatology clinical practice . The SCQOLIT take less five minute patient complete similar score calculation DLQI . Acceptability feasibility tool never rigorously assessed Dermatology clinic . Studies evaluate PROMs NMSC largely assess relation surgical treatment yet basal cell carcinoma effectively treat use medical treatment e.g . topical immunomodulators photodynamic therapy , date , PROMs investigate sub-populations . Justification : This feasibility study design evaluate SCQOLIT questionnaire , aim establish utility impact patient NMSC . The investigator assess patient clinician acceptability SCQOLIT questionnaire tool hope identify unmet need , potentially inform future clinical decision and/or service planning . Study design : Participants : All patient refer Dermatology Tumour outpatient clinic clinically suspect NMSC . There four category participant , Groups 1 - 3 participant new diagnosis NMSC ( primary recurrent ) site body : Group 1 ( Postal ) - include patient 'low risk ' NMSC ( namely basal cell carcinoma ) Group 2 ( Clinic-based ) - include patient 'moderate high risk ' NMSC ( namely SCC rare NMSC ) Group 3 ( Interview ) - volunteer select Groups 1 2 . Group 4 ( Focus Group : Clinicians ) - include Dermatology staff member involve consent collect PROMS data role direct care patient attend Dermatology outpatient clinic .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adults age 18 yr old All patient histopathological diagnosis NMSC ( primary recurrent disease ) All treatment use NMSC include ; excision , shave excision , curettage cautery , Mohs micrographic surgery , photodynamic therapy topical treatment e.g . imiquimod cream . The participant may enter study ANY follow apply : Concurrent internal malignancy likely significantly influence QOL . Patients refer onwards specialty management skin cancer e.g . Plastic surgeon / Clinical oncology . Other significant dermatological disease e.g . severe inflammatory blister skin condition may influence QOL . Inability consent .</criteria>
