Very overweight/obese child receive evidence-based treatment improve weight status health . The pilot data suggest new model , peer-based delivery FBT FBT-treated parent train subsequently deliver FBT family , feasible demonstrate initial efficacy . This delivery model could dramatically reduce FBT cost increase FBT availability . Preliminary data also suggest serve peer interventionist may also benefit peer child well sustain weight outcome . The present study aim provide definitive test short- long-term efficacy peer- versus professionally-delivered FBT child weight outcome . Embedded comparison examination feasibility peer-based FBT delivery , investigate impact serve peer interventionist peer ' child 's long- term weight status , comprehensive examination differential cost professional- versus peer- base FBT delivery . The present study also test potential dissemination sustainability examine efficacy peer-delivered FBT among peer interventionists receive FBT peer professional interventionists . Moderation treatment outcome also examine , focus peer interventionist child characteristic . This multi-phase trial enroll 304 family 7-11 year old overweight/obese child multiple sit throughout region , include short-term ( post-treatment ) long-term ( 1 year treatment cessation ) assessment . This investigation innovative approach could significantly reduce FBT delivery cost , also improve maintenance treatment effect , critical improve health many already overweight child risk chronic disease .</detailed_description>
