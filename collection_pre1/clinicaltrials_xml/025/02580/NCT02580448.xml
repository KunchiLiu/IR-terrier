	<criteria>1 . Patients must document histological cytological evidence invasive cancer breast . Measureable disease require . 2 . Phase 1 patient must TNBC ER ( + ) HER2 normal breast cancer Phase 2 patient must AR ( + ) TNBC ER ( + ) HER2 normal breast cancer ER positive define positive ≥1 % IHC ER/PgR ( ) define negative 0 % IHC HER2 normal define IHC 01+ IHC 2+ ( FISH less 2 ) , FISH le 2.0 AR ( + ) define ≥1 % IHC . The assessment AR expression may perform time past . Enrollment may base local pathology finding subsequent review AR expression central pathology determine patient consider evaluable Phase 2 . For patient without know AR status Phase 2 , AR assessment perform prescreening test follow sign separate nontherapeutic inform consent . 3 . Female patient ER ( + ) /HER2 normal tumor must postmenopausal defined cessation regular menses least 12 consecutive month alternative pathological physiological cause , serum FSH level within laboratory 's reference range postmenopausal females ≥ 60 year old . Ovarian suppression LHRH agonist antagonist achieve cessation regular menses allow study .

Ovarian suppression LHRH agonist achieve cessation regular menses allow study . 13 . Women childbearing potential men partner childbearing potential must agree use two highly effective method contraception throughout study least 30 day last dose VT464 woman 90 day last dose VT464 men . Men must also agree donate sperm 90 day follow last dose VT464 . For men , one form must male condom . Highly effective method contraception : Established use oral , inserted , injected implant hormonal method contraception allow provide patient plan remain treatment throughout entire study use hormonal contraceptive adequate period time ensure effectiveness . Correctly place coppercontaining intrauterine device ( IUD ) Male condom female condom use WITH spermicide ( ie , foam , gel , film , cream , suppository ) . Bilateral tubal ligation bilateral salpingectomy bilateral tubal occlusive procedure ( provide occlusion confirm accordance device 's label ) . Vasectomy 14 . Patients legal representative must willing able provide write informed consent 1 . Patients require pharmacological replacement dos systemic corticosteroid receive systemic corticosteroid within 7 day study drug initiation . 2 . Patients receive investigational agent within 5 halflives agent question ; halflife know , within 28 day study entry . 3 . Patients receive antiandrogens within 4 week study entry . 4 . Patients receive palliative radiotherapy within 4 week study entry . 5 . Patients receive therapeutic treatment breast cancer within 2 week study entry , except LHRH agonist antagonists patient undergo ovarian suppression enrol Female ER ( + ) BC cohort patient undergo gonadal suppression enrol Male ER ( + ) BC cohort . 6 . Patients symptomatic CNS metastasis breast cancer 7 . Patients history adrenal insufficiency . Patients receive systemic corticosteroid great 2weeks duration within 6 month study entry must lack adrenal insufficiency evidence morning plasma cortisol concentration ≥ 500 nmol/l plasma cortisol response ACTH stimulation test deem clinical normal . 8 .
