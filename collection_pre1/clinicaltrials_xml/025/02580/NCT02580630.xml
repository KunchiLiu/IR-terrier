	<brief_title>Achilles Tendinopathy Treated With Training Injections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Achilles tendinopathy common often longlasting condition especially sport population . The high incidence see sport involve run jumping . As primary treatment eccentric exercise recommend 60-90 % benefit . Other study show equal effect stretch exercise . In new study heavy slow resistance exercise proven effective achilles tendinopathy best treatment lig.patellae tendinopathy . Injection glucocorticosteroid often use daily clinic , though inflammation rarely find . Fredberg 2004 find good short term effect glucocorticosteroid injection RCT , effect long term , investigator explain aggressive rehabilitation run day . Even though 60-90 % benefit exercise efficacy study , recent pragmatic effectiveness study Weetke 2015 find 26 % benefit training alone , supplement need 1-3 injection glucocorticosteroid 76 % achieve excellent good result . To knowledge randomized clinical trial investigate combined effect training injection . The hypothesis study , train slowly progressive rehabilitation combine glucocorticosteroid injection well effect train rehabilitation combine injection local anesthetic .</detailed_description>
