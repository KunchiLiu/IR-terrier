	<brief_title>Comparison Two Different Low-level Laser Intensity Protocols Healing Palatal Wounds</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , parallel control clinical trial . The population evaluate study select Science Technology Institute - ICT- São José do Campos , College Dentistry . Patients assign one three treatment group : - Group 60 ( Test , n=18 ) : Periodontal surgery root coverage connective tissue graft LLLT application donor site use 60 J/cm² dose . - Group 30 ( Test , n=18 ) : Periodontal surgery root coverage connective tissue graft LLLT application donor site use 30 J/cm² dose . - Group Sham ( Control , n= 18 ) : Periodontal surgery root coverage connective tissue graft LLLT SHAM donor site . All surgery perform expert periodontist ( MPS ) . Before surgical procedure , patient enlighten cause consequence gingival recession prevention technique . Factors related origin gingival recession , toothbrush trauma inflammation cause biofilm , control instruction standardize brushing technique avoid influence hygiene method capable promote trauma soft tissue . Standardized dental floss toothbrush give patient . The surgical technique adopt recession defect trapezoidal-type CAF connective tissue graft remove palate mucosa . Briefly , first incision palate perform perpendicularly long axis teeth , 2 3 mm apical gingival margin . The mesial-distal length incision determine length graft require cover recession . Because select recession maxillary canine premolar , length graft vary minimally ( 10-12mm ) . The second incision make parallel first one ( 1-2 mm apically parallel long axis teeth ) separate subepithelium connective tissue epithelial layer . The incision carry far enough apically provide 7- mm height connective tissue cover denude root surface . Afterward , another incision parallel long axis teeth start first incision perform separate subepithelium connective tissue periosteum . Then , connective tissue graft remove palate atraumatically possible . Single suture make palate ( 4-0 silk ) graft suture receptor site . The evaluated parameter wound remain area ( WRA ) , scar tissue colorimetry ( TC ) , tissue thickness ( TT ) postoperative discomfort ( D ) , evaluate baseline 7 , 14 , 45 , 60 , 90 day surgery . Statistical Analysis : All data express mean ± standard deviation express percentage descriptive phase . Data analyze accord distribution Shapiro-Wilk test . For remain wound area , tissue colorimetry , tissue thickness , postoperative discomfort parameter analysis , two way repeat measure ANOVA perform intra- intergroup analysis . T test use intergroup comparison number analgesic take . The presence absence scar measure Q-square test . Statistical analysis perform use Sigma Plot 12.0 . In test significance level 0.05 chosen .</detailed_description>
