	<brief_summary>Multiple sclerosis ( MS ) inflammatory disease affect nervous system result wide range sign symptom include physical cognitive problem . Recent evidence demonstrate interaction host immune system commensal gut microbiota key role development disease . However , nature interaction poorly study , set bacteria pathogenic protective potential unknown . Here , investigator propose multi-pronged approach decipher role microbiota MS , develop microbiome-based machine learn algorithm aim : ( 1 ) distinguish healthy individual MS patient ; ( 2 ) predicting time since onset MS relation disease activity predict next relapse neurological progression ; ( 3 ) identify microbiome signature characterize relapse state ; ( 4 ) distinguish various MS phenotype relation blood microbiome transcriptome signature ; ( 5 ) predict response various immunomodulatory treatment relation blood microbiome transcriptome signature . Overall , study establish role microbiome multiple sclerosis , result set non-invasive tool characterization disease ; identification kinetics MS use microbiome readout ; allow prediction individual prone MS base microbiome relation protein expression . These new set diagnostic predictive tool may thus add novel unexplored dimension study disease may lead future new therapeutic avenue base design microbiome-targeted intervention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Description method plan operation Our research plan consist follow step : 1 . Cohort assembly . For aims investigator use unique database Sheba Medical Center identify relevant individual invite take part study . Prof. Achiron much experience conduct many research project utilize unique patient database available Center . For first aim compare MS patient healthy individual investigator select sex- , age- diet-matched healthy individual , ideally select spouse MS patient healthy control individual live environment similar microbiota . In second aim compare MS patient similar time diagnosis different disease severity , investigator select MS patient span large possible spectrum disease severity judge EDSS score employ Center . For final aim individual high risk relapse invite profile every 6 month relapse occur , profile upon visit Center well one month relapse event . 2 . Cohort profile . From patient , investigator obtain multi-dimensional data MS database consist , appropriate , subset : ( 1 ) Clinical metadata , include : Consent form ; Medications ; annual relapse rate ; ( 2 ) Blood test , include complete blood count , complete biochemistry , lipid profile , cholesterol profile ; ( 3 ) Complete neurological examination obtain EDSS score , cognitive assessment , gait assessment ; MRI image data , evoked potential , treatment response ; ( 4 ) Blood sample process protein mRNA expression peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) separate Ficoll-Hypaque gradient , total RNA purify , label , hybridize Genechip array ( U133A2 ) , scan ( GeneArray-TM scanner G2500A ; Hewlett Packard ) accord manufacturer 's protocol ( Affymetrix , Santa Clara , CA ) . MAS5 software ( Affymetrix ) use analyze scan array contain ~22,000 gene transcript correspond 14,500 well-annotated human gene . ( 5 ) Gut microbiota profile obtain stool sample process shotgun metagenomic sequence 16S rRNA profiling . Gut microbiota profile do stool sample immediately flash-frozen liquid nitrogen preserve minimum -80°C processing . Samples process automate robotic pipeline develop Segal lab Weizmann . This pipeline work 96-well format extract DNA 96 stool sample within one day , prepare DNA Illumina libraries shotgun metagenomic sequencing within another day , carry multiplexed polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) amplification 16S rRNA gene another day . Thus , every 96-stool sample group collect process robotically 16S metagenomic sequencing within 3 day supervision one lab technician . 3 . Data analysis algorithmic development . ( I ) Microbiota : To comprehensively study role microbiome MS , investigator go much beyond standard 16S rRNA analysis analysis full shotgun metagenome sample . By sequence entire DNA content stool sample , metagenome sequence potentially provide much information compare 16S , allow study genome structure , structural variant , gene metabolic pathway function . After extract feature microbiome ( see Preliminary Results ) , investigator start employ basic univariate multivariate association test , continue complex machine learning model attempt distinguish individual MS without base microbiome feature ( aim 1 ) , classify disease severity ( aim 2 ) , predict relapse risk ( aim 3 ) , differentiate MS disease phenotype i.e. , radiologically isolated syndrome ( RIS ) , clinically isolated syndrome ( CIS ) , relapsing-remitting MS ( RRMS ) , primary-progressive MS ( PPMS ) , ( aim 4 ) , identify treatment responder ( aim 5 ) . ( II ) Blood : To analyze protein expression Partek Genomics Software ( www.partek.com ) use . 4 . Univariate multivariate analysis . The investigator first compute correlation ( Pearson Spearman ) microbiome feature extract across profiled individual different patient measurement ( EDSS score , time relapse , etc . ) , correct multiple hypothesis perform . Since investigator generate vast number microbiome feature many highly correlate , analysis may suffer lack statistical power , especially give number participant far small number feature . For reason , investigator also perform multivariate analysis ( e.g. , singular value decomposition , principal component analysis ) since key component identify method capture main variation data way take account internal structure relationship different input feature . The investigator test whether projection data main principal component analysis provide significant segregation participant measure metabolic parameter . As different type multivariate analysis , investigator also employ different unsupervised clustering method ( e.g. , hierarchical clustering , naïve Bayes ) cluster participant microbiome feature data , examine cluster enrichment normal abnormal metabolic parameter . Machine learn algorithms . As global approach aim quantify overall contribution microbiome MS unravel relative contribution different microbiome feature , investigator classify study participant several group aim ( e.g. , aim 1 patient versus healthy individual ; aim 2 individual high versus low EDSS score similar time MS diagnosis ) , develop different computational method ( e.g. , boost decision tree , Support Vector Machine algorithm ( SVMs ) ) classification problem use microbiome feature generate . The investigator use cross validation scheme , whereby model train do data randomly choose subset participant test data remain held participant . In addition , investigator leave aside test set investigator evaluate final model derive cross validation , allow true estimate performance model . As number microbiome feature thus number dimension large , investigator employ various feature selection approach mean avoid overfitting reduce dimensionality . The Segal lab ( Weizmann ) pioneer development several method similar setting area gene regulation . The investigator also use similar scheme predict continuous EDSS score represent MS severity . The problem setup similar classification , method development quite different classification method replace regression type method ( e.g. , linear regression , probabilistic model , stochastic gradient descent ) .</detailed_description>
