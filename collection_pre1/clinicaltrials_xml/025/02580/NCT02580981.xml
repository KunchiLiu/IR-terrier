	<brief_summary>Previous work perform University New Mexico Comprehensive Cancer Center ( UNMCCC ) investigator reveal previously unknown genomic mutation child , adolescent , young adult high-risk B T cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) . Using genomic next generation DNA sequence technology , investigator reveal 14 % child high-risk ALL `` Philadelphia chromosome-like '' ( `` Ph-like '' ) ALL . Patients form ALL find significantly increase risk treatment failure death . Further work reveal 40 distinct gene rearrangement fusion result Ph-like ALL . Cell line human leukemic cell express different gene fusion sensitive currently available drug . This suggest Ph-like ALL patient specific distinct gene fusion target future clinical trial treat appropriate therapy . Further work also need identify potentially targetable genetic alteration ALL patient . Therefore , goal study perform genomic screen newly diagnose ALL patient see UNM use information enroll patient onto available National Clinical Trial Network ( NCTN ) clinical trial . If appropriate NCTN trial available , best clinical management pursued .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The work perform UNMCCC investigator others describe briefly provide major insight biologic clinical feature genomic landscape Ph-like ALL , strikingly heterogeneous . Gene expression profile RNA/transcriptomic , exome , whole genome sequence identify several distinct subclass kinase activate lesion 91 % Ph-like ALL case study date , commonly kinase cytokine receptor gene rearrangement fusion . UNMCCC investigator collaborate Children 's Oncology Group ( COG ) adult National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Cooperative Groups ( Southwest Oncology Group ( SWOG ) , Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) - American College Radiology Imaging Network ( ACRIN ) , The Alliance ) develop national clinical trial pediatric , adolescent young adult ( AYA ) , adult ALL patient incorporate genomic diagnostic screen , molecular diagnostics , next generation sequence study identify underlie genomic lesion ALL target patient appropriate therapeutic regimen . In feasibility study , next generation sequencing ( NGS ) technology inform acute lymphoblastic leukemia risk classification system , may adapt identify patient might benefit targeted therapy ; patient target NCTN National Treatment trial UNMCCC-sponsored trial appropriate , detailed genomic data analysis perform College American Pathologists ( CAP ) /CLIA condition individual case discussion Molecular Tumor Board . In addition , association race ethnicity spectrum ALL-associated genomic mutation New Mexico regional ALL population , include significant proportion underrepresented minority , study . This may ultimately allow development ancestry-based risk classification system .</detailed_description>
