	<brief_summary>The investigator collect data chart patient diagnose facet joint syndrome underwent lumbar RF medial branch neurotomy January 2009 June 2014 . RF perform use sensory stimulation multifidus twitch confirm position RF needle . The patient wil group accord adequacy RF needle position perform RF medial branch neurotomy ( 'complete ' needle place adequately , 'partial ' one needle facet joint medial branch place inadequately , 'none ' needle position inadequately facet joint ) The relationship long term effect RF neurotomy ( long 6 month ) group analyze .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multifidus Muscle Twitch Prognosis Lumbar Medial Branch RF</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Facet joint syndrome describe common cause lumbar back pain . To achieve prolonged therapeutic effect patient lumbar facet joint syndrome , radiofrequency ( RF ) medial branch neurotomy commonly perform . When perform RF neurotomy , needle placement correct position important . For reason , identification sensory stimulation multifidus muscle twitch use electrode commonly perform . However , previous report regard relationship prognosis RF neurotomy multifidus muscle twitch combination sensory stimulation . The purpose study evaluate prognostic value multifidus twitch sensory stimulation achieve perform RF needle neurotomy patient lumbar facet syndrome . The investigator collect data chart patient diagnose facet joint syndrome underwent lumbar RF medial branch neurotomy January 2009 June 2014 . RF perform use sensory stimulation multifidus twitch confirm position RF needle . When numeric pain intensity score decrease less half initial pain score , procedure regard effective duration follow recorded patient . When multifidus twitch observed voltage less 1.0 2.0 time sensory stimulation ( â‰¤ 0.5V ) , position RF needle regard adequate . The appropriate cutoff value determine univariate analysis . The patient group accord adequacy RF needle position perform RF medial branch neurotomy ( 'complete ' needle place adequately , 'partial ' one needle facet joint medial branch place inadequately , 'none ' needle position inadequately facet joint ) The relationship long term effect RF neurotomy ( long 6 month ) group analyze .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>All patient diagnose facet joint syndrome underwent lumbar RF medial branch neurotomy January 2009 June 2014. absence 12month followup data , patient underwent RF medial branch neurotomy bilateral side patient underwent surgery interventional procedure might affect pain derived lumbar facet joint followup period</criteria>
