	<brief_title>Study Human Epidermal Growth Receptor ( HER2 ) Status Evaluation Breast Cancer Pathology Samples</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For accurate selection participant treat anti-HER2 , primary crucial thing right identification HER2 breast tumor cell . The advantage disadvantage IHC In-Situ Hybridization ( ISH ) detection HER2 status still disputable . It generally agree HER2 study apply invasive breast cancer participant . It use together IHC measure HER2 protein expression ISH assess HER2 gene amplification . With regard IHC , inconsistency sensitivity specificity market antibody , difference interpretation technical artifact cause problem diagnosis occasion . There enough study reason cause consistence discrepancy laboratories HER2 detection IHC method .</detailed_description>
