	<brief_summary>Diabetic nephropathy ( kidney problem cause diabetes ) devastate chronic vascular complication diabetes . New treatment urgently need prevent slow progression diabetic kidney disease . Samples serum/plasma/urine obtain patient diabetes different degree renal impairment . In project cell culture treat plasma serum urine ; cell extract supernatant study screen modulation ( activation/inhibition ) different cellular pathway use gene array , metabolomic and/or proteomic . Once cellular pathway identify specific analysis conduct biological material collect confirm specific `` cell signature '' could represent potential target treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aim study investigate novel putative mechanism involve pathophysiology kidney disease diabetic patient . The investigator make use plasma , serum urine obtain patient diabetes . Cells culture treat plasma serum urine ; cell extract supernatant study screen modulation ( activation/inhibition ) different cellular pathway use gene array , metabolomic and/or proteomic . Once cellular pathway identify specific analysis conduct biological material collect confirm specific `` cell signature '' could represent potential target treatment . The investigator recruit patient type 1 type 2 diabetes attend outpatient diabetes clinic Guys ' St Thomas Hospital . The participant inform aim research agreeable donate blood urine sample ; participant ask sign write informed consent explain simple word aim research , involvement ( blood sample urine sample collection ) , minimal risk expose ( venopuncture ) . The study involve one blood collection arm , 30 ml ( 6 tea spoon ) per year ( 10 yea duration ) , collect 2 occasions/ year ( minimum time two collection : 4 week ) , 15ml ( 3 tea spoon ) blood maximum volume take per occasion . Urine sample ( amount ) might also collect time . Blood urine collection take approximately 15 minute . This research low risk . Samples store within Unit Metabolic Medicine ( Dr Gnudi ) , King 's College London , United Kingdom , potential future use within remit advancement science benefit public domain within academic and/or commercial organisation ( e.g . pharmaceutical industry ) worldwide . Any information collect participant course research keep strictly confidential . Any information leave hospital name address patient remove recognised third party . The result obtain research likely publish medical journal . The investigator provide copy publish result anybody may request . Participants identified report/publication .</detailed_description>
