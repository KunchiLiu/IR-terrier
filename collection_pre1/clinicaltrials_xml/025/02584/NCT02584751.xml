	<brief_summary>Respiratory dysfunction , esophageal dysmotility , gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) demonstrate highly prevalent person SCI . GERD link respiratory symptom condition asthma , chronic cough , increased rate respiratory infection general population . In person asthma , respiratory symptom dependency asthma medication reduce treatment anti-reflux medication . Possible mechanism propose link , include microaspiration reflux material , may result airway acidification aspiration pneumonia , stimulation vagus nerve acid-sensitive receptor esophagus associate esophageal inflammation reflex bronchoconstriction . Investigators propose study effect anti-reflux therapy ( proton pump inhibition ) person SCI objective subjective symptom respiratory function determine underlie mechanism airway inflammation due GERD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Complete partial loss respiratory muscle innervation individual cervical ( C1-8 ) high thoracic ( T1-6 ) injuries lead inadequate ventilation inability effectively clear secretion , often prompt supportive ventilation follow initial injury . Development atelectasis , pneumonias respiratory failure common respiratory complication observe acute phase injury . The role chronic airway inflammation pulmonary function person SCI unknown , although investigator ' recent work show individual cervical SCI elevate level exhale nitric oxide ( NO ) , comparable see mild asthma . It widely believe airway asthmatic patient , release NO represent physiological mechanism counteract bronchoconstriction cause various stimulus . In person cervical SCI , bronchoconstriction may represent consequence unopposed parasympathetic influence , alternative mechanism , recurrent infection secondary impaired cough effectiveness , systemic inflammatory response follow SCI , extra-esophageal manifestation underlie esophageal dysmotility and/or GERD need evaluate . In general population , long recognize esophageal dysmotility and/or GERD may lead extra-esophageal manifestation . Reflux affect upper low respiratory system lead variety extra-esophageal manifestation , reflux asthma , chronic cough , hoarseness , chronic sinusitis , laryngitis , loss dental enamel , idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis , recurrent pneumonia , chronic bronchitis , etc . 2 possible mechanisms complication identify : direct aspiration reflux content indirectly , stimulation vagally-mediated reflex . Regardless underlying mechanism , treatment acid-reducing therapy show improvement GERD extra-esophageal manifestation disease general population . Investigators propose study effect anti-reflux therapy ( proton pump inhibition ) person SCI objective subjective symptom respiratory function determine underlie mechanism airway inflammation due GERD .</detailed_description>
