	<brief_title>Phase 1/2a Evaluation Adding AL3818 Standard Platinum-Based Chemotherapy Subjects With Recurrent Metastatic Endometrial , Ovarian , Fallopian , Primary Peritoneal Cervical Carcinoma ( AL3818-US-002 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This trial Phase 1b/2a trial design evaluate safety efficacy add oral AL3818 standard platinum-based chemotherapy carboplatin plus paclitaxel , concurrently continue maintenance therapy 12 month , subject recurrent metastatic endometrial , ovarian , fallopian , primary peritoneal , cervical carcinoma . AL3818 novel small molecule dual receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor , show highly selective inhibition fibroblast growth factor receptor ( FGFr ) vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ( VEGFR ) . Preclinical study agent mouse model , include various cancer xenograft , demonstrate treatment tumor-bearing mouse AL3818 induces tumor reduction . This study divide two part . The objective Part 1 evaluation safety tolerability add oral AL3818 standard carboplatin plus paclitaxel chemotherapy cycle 21 day determine recommend Phase II dose ( RP2D ) . The objective Part 2 evaluation preliminary efficacy safety add oral AL3818 RP2D determine Part 1 carboplatin paclitaxel chemotherapy 6 cycle . Continuous maintenance mono therapy 14 day 7 day regimen RP2D conduct 12 month extendable beyond disease progression .</detailed_description>
