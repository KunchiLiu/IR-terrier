Using quasi-experimental design investigator compare effect adopt implement Safe Opioid Prescription Practice ( SOPP ) protocol within Level 1 trauma service team compare Level 1 trauma service team implement standard care . Providers sit complete web-based survey assess baseline knowledge , attitude barrier related safe prescription practice . The intervention site complete technical assistance activity lead adoption implementation SOPP protocol . The control site continue offer standard care trauma patient throughout phase . To measure institutional level change , chart review conduct site use blind medical review discharge trauma service patient baseline , early implementation , implementation maintenance phase . To measure patient level change , investigator assess patient perception discharge experience sit adoption phase ( Cohort 1=100 ) ; implementation phase ( Cohort 2=100 ) maintenance phase ( Cohort 3=100 ) via telephone interview within 7 day post discharge . Three month interview also conduct Cohort 2 ass patient opioid usage , pain management strategy Naloxone usage among Cohort 2 . The aim propose research study 1 ) examine measure adoption , implementation maintenance SOPP protocol intervention site compare standard care site 2 ) ass patient level outcome SOPP protocol . The secondary aim study assess effect SOPP protocol provider prescribing practice compare average dosage ( morphine milligram equivalent ) duration dose chart review baseline early implementation , implementation maintenance phase study . The finding study allow u good understand translation safe opioid prescription practice potential impact best practice patient discharge within Level 1 trauma center .</detailed_description>
