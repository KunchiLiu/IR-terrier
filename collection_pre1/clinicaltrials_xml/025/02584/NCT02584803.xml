	<detailed_description>Anesthesiology consultant trainees US experience first perform scan RUQ view start mid-axillary line T4 intercostal space , look obtain view IVC enters right atrium ( RA ) . Following successful acquisition , examiner perform scan subxiphoid position , look obtain view IVC transitioning RA . Primary endpoint time obtain quality image . The investigator use stopwatch time acquisition image . If duration scan exceeds ten minute , scan discontinue label fail . Each image separately review 2 different US specialist extensive US experience . Images assess accord Likert scale 1 5 . ( Very poor ( 1 ) , poor ( 2 ) , acceptable ( 3 ) , good ( 4 ) , good ( 5 ) ) Secondary endpoint assess follow : 1 . Acceptability : patient participate study complete questionnaire ass acceptability . 2 . Comfort : During exam patient option suspend scan state uncomfortable wish stop .
