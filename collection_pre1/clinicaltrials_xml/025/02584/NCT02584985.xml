	<brief_summary>Standard surgical treatment mid low rectal cancer total mesorectal excision ( TME ) . Originally perform open surgery , TME demonstrate improved local control reduce urogenital morbidity . Laparoscopic approach validate several randomise control trial : laparoscopic approach offer patient good post-operative recovery , low risk wound hernia comparable oncological result . However , risk conversion open procedure remain significant . Endoscopic Transanal Proctectomy allow retrograd mesorectal excision , perform whole pelvic dissection via specific-moderate cost device . The procedure complete briefer transabdominal laparoscopic step mobilise colon perform inferior mesenteric vessel ligation , prior low coloanal anastomosis . The originality approach perform surgical dissection via extra peritoneal route , without peritoneal abdominal wound trauma . This focus new technical improvement area mini-invasive pelviabdominal surgery use natural orifice surgical access . This approach offer close good exposure pelvic dissection plane could improve oncological quality pelvic nerve preservation . It could profitable postoperative patient outcome . However rate type cancer-recurrences well functional result assess controlled study . This technique show feasible reproducible early clinical series . Conversion rate appear low publish rate laparoscopic approach , markedly inferior 10 % . Compiled rate morbidity ( 27.8 % ) , R1 resection* ( 6 % ) , mesorectum macroscopic integrity ( 100 % ) appear comparable laparoscopic approach result . However functional result well urologic morbidity evaluate comparative study . In preliminary retrospective comparative ( n=72 ) found comparable oncological quality criterion ( R1 resection 5.9 % vs 10.5 % p 0.74 , Grade 3 mesorectal integrity 57.5 v 56.2 p 0.99 ) , low conversion rate open procedure ( 2.9 % vs 23.6 % p 0.011 ) , short in-hospital stay ( 8 vs 9 day p 0.038 ) . Comparable morbidity rate ( Dindo 1-4 27 % vs 34 % p 0.52 ) functional result ( Kirwan 1/2 80.3 % vs 80.6 % p 0.94 ) also found . These data need confirm . To date , Endoscopic Transanal Proctectomy evaluate preliminary study include several short series demonstrate feasibility technique show low morbidity . For author benefit transanal approach significant difficult case male patient narrow pelvis . Very recently , two non randomise comparative study publish conclusion close study . Investigators propose , support GRECCAR group , conduct national , multicenter , open-label randomize study base oncological non-inferiority ( R1 resection rate ) main objective , compare Endoscopic Transanal Proctectomy Standard Transabdominal Laparoscopic Proctectomy , low lie rectal cancer require manual colo-anal anastomosis . There clear expect benefit expect patient ETAP procedure term post operative short term outcome , risk conversion open procedure , risk wind hernia.This trial could also show significant advantage term quality dissection , quality specimen , quality nerve preservation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The main objective study ass R1 resection rate Endoscopic Transanal Proctectomy ( ETAP ) meaningfully inferior Standard Laparoscopic TME low lie rectal cancer require manual colo-anal anastomosis . The secondary objective evaluate conversion rate , mini invasive level abdominal approach postoperative morbidity , In hospital length stay , Mesorectum macroscopic assessment , Functional urologic sexual result , Fecal Continency , global QoL , stoma-free survival , disease-free survival 3 year . Patients non metastatic rectal adenocarcinoma require coloanal anastomosis consider study . Based non-inferiority hypothesis , population estimate study 226 patient , 113 arm . Inclusion period 3 year , study run 6 year .</detailed_description>
