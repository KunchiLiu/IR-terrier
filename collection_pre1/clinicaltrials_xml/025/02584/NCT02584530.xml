	<brief_summary>This randomize control study compare US guide vs standard procedure PICC line placement newborn admit Children 's Hospital Eastern Ontario Neonatal Intensive Care Unit require PICC line . Patients randomize use REDCap randomization module ( stratified gestational age &lt; 28 week &gt; = 28 week block ensure approximate balance stratum ) two arm . - Arm 1 : PICC line insertion procedure use anatomical landmark tip placement confirm X-ray ( current standard ) ; Arm 2 : US guide PICC line insertion procedure tip placement confirmation US X-ray . Sample size 33 infant per group would achieve great 80 % power detect difference group . Primary outcome : Time complete standard versus US-guided procedure . Secondary outcome ( comparison two arm ) : The number total `` venipuncture '' attempt need place PICC line Number tip manipulation complete insertion Proportion successful tip placement</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter ( PICC ) line placement one commonly perform procedure Neonatology . Due prematurity small vein size , procedure often require multiple attempt increase timeframe . As standard care , position confirm X-ray . Frequently , catheter optimally position , necessitate reposition radiograph . The use ultrasound ( US ) guidance PICC line placement enhances visualization vein provide good selection optimal access . It could decrease even eliminate need X-rays use confirm tip position . Objectives To demonstrate use US-guidance place confirm tip position PICC line insertion neonates decrease number cannulation attempt , shorten time need complete procedure , decrease infant ' exposure radiation . Methods This randomize control study compare US guide vs standard procedure PICC line placement newborn admit CHEO NICU require PICC line ( approximately 130-150 infant per year ) . Patients randomize use REDCap randomization module ( stratified gestational age &lt; 28 week &gt; = 28 week block ensure approximate balance stratum ) two arm - Arm 1 : PICC line insertion procedure use anatomical landmark tip placement confirm X-ray ( current standard ) ; Arm 2 : US guide PICC line insertion procedure tip placement confirmation US X-ray . A sample size 33 infant per group would sufficient achieve great 80 % power detect difference group . Results study may demonstrate US guide PICC line placement superior ( short safer procedure , reduce radiation pain ) currently use procedure could lead practice change .</detailed_description>
