	<brief_title>Osteopathic Medicine Management Care-induced Pain Elderly Care ( OGÃ©DIS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prevalence pain elderly important , especially people live institution ( 40-70 % accord recent study ) . Among common complaint include pain induced treatment . It define Upsa Laboratory pain `` short duration cause caregiver foreseeable occurrence circumstance prevent suitable measure . '' Responsible care induce pain dressing , levy diagnostics action , mobilization exchange , toilet , transfer different service act rehabilitation . The repetition act therefore pain , also source anxiety old people often anticipate follow treatment , thus hind care relationship . The evaluation induce pain grow concern caregiver . It concern player care , medical paramedical . Prevention relief pain induced part regulatory obligation become since Law 4 March 2002 patient ' right quality health system . It dynamic , 2006 Ministry Health Solidarity launch support plan improve pain , one whose objective promote quality life old people reduce impact pain daily life . To assess pain senior several scale list validate : ECPA scale allow evaluation recurrent pain induce pain use service Suite Geriatric Rehabilitation ( SSRG ) ; Doloplus scale suitable evaluation chronic pain finally Algoplus scale specialized evaluation acute pain . The pain assessment difficulty elderly also accentuate many possible etiology , fatalistic attitude belief pain part normal age process . It therefore identify intensity pain , characteristic cause guide treatment . The pain relief base non-drug mean ( prevention , care explanation , hypnosis , massage , cryotherapy ) , / medication analgesia longer sufficient . Drug treatment , however , disadvantage frequent side effect difficult use elderly already poly medicate . Non-drug therapy , help limit requirement , therefore side effect , consider addition usual care . Osteopathy holistic manual medicine aim prevent remedy various functional disorder body . This discipline wide scope whose positive influence demonstrate particular musculoskeletal pain type neck pain , back pain , visceral chronic constipation , gastric reflux , migraine , back pain chronic elderly institution . This study 's main objective determine randomize control clinical trial , efficacy osteopathy reduction pain induce elderly institution . This type study impact public health policy help improve : - treatment pain induced people SSRG ; - propose good use medication non-pharmacological method like osteopathy ; - assist structure health care sector . The public randomize use block randomization , two group : `` osteopathy '' group `` simulated '' group ( simulate technique ) . Both procedure provide operator . Two exclusive osteopathic load group `` osteopathy '' `` simulate '' accord randomization set ensure random distribution group , say , operator many patient simulate . Service nurse charge data collection , blind , say knowledge patient include study membership group . This methodology allow u well justify contribution osteopathy relation natural course patient 's health status , justify contribution osteopathy regardless operator . Operators support different patient include study way , regardless allocation group . Thus , apply standardized osteopathic simulate procedure ( describe ) attitude support operator . Including verbal exchange , address different area patient , whether medical , family , professional . The goal ensure standardization management , standardize simulated treatment make look like point care osteopathic . For sake continuity treatment , `` osteopathic '' `` simulate '' operator assign randomization perform 3 session patient . -Group `` osteopathy `` : osteopathic fascial procedure use , technique call `` impulsive `` ( Thrust technique patient may hear crack sound ) . This approach therefore present particular risk side effect patient . Specifically , follow technique apply operator order wish : A technical ( ) scar ( ) - Technical overall equilibration upper limbs - Technical overall equilibration lower limb - A basic technique spread - Technical C0 equilibration relative sternum - A technique diaphragmatic equilibration - A fascial technique dorsal vertebra / lumbar At protocol perform osteopathy group assign area address technique coefficient osteopathic dysfunction assess way : - Lack dysfunction , coefficient 0 - low Dysfunction , coefficient equal 1 - moderate dysfunction , coefficient equal 2 - strong Dysfunction , coefficient equal 3 These coefficient record table meeting allow operator monitor patient dysfunctional pattern . - Group `` simulate `` : The simulate protocol similar use study John C. Licciardone et al . validate North Texas Chronic Low Back Pain Trial , perform position care osteopathic . The operator place hand area , avoid associate mobilize joint muscle . Both procedure `` osteopathic `` `` simulated '' , provide three session last 60 minute , one week apart . The interval one week justify fact nurse care repeat several time day , constraint prolong bed rest permanent , tissue patient find advanced state fibrosis . It seem necessary allow integration time session . The choice 3 session base compromise feasibility service , acceptability patient investigator ' assessment optimal intensity procedure . Week 4 , data collection realize .</detailed_description>
