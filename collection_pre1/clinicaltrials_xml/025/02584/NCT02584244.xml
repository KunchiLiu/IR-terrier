	<detailed_description>The overall goal feasibility study assess initial safety efficacy novel , intravenously administer cathepsin activatable imaging probe , LUM015 , ex vivo far-red imaging colorectal , pancreatic , esophageal cancer ( adenocarcinoma ) use LUM 2.6 Imaging Device . All subject establish diagnosis colorectal , pancreatic , esophageal adenocarcinoma schedule resection primary tumor . Patients see surgeon office visit undergo routine preoperative test within four week plan surgery . During pre-surgery visit complete history physical examination standard care pre-operative laboratory study ( include ECG ) perform . On day plan surgery , LUM015 administer bolus intravenous injection 2-6 hour prior surgery preoperative area . The patient monitor adverse event discharge hospital . Follow subject continue first post-operative visit . Patients undergo plan surgical resection 2-6 hour LUM015 administer . All surgical specimen ( whether contain normal tissue tumor tissue ) send pathology suite image LUM 2.6 Imaging Device routine diagnostic assessment . Imaged area show high fluorescence mark guide pathology evaluation determine whether area contains tumor . Samples image area show low fluorescence signal also evaluate pathology determine whether area contains normal tissue . After image , part tissue fresh frozen correlative study . The patient expect admitted hospital surgical procedure remain hospital post-surgery indicate required surgeon per standard care treatment . While hospital , patient assess adverse event . Laboratory study also perform time part routine post-surgical care ass image agent related adverse event .</detailed_description>
