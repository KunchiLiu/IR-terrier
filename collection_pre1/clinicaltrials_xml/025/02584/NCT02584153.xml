	<brief_summary>Incisional hernia frequent consequence abdominal surgery . Current clinical effort primarily focus improve repair material surgical technique correct hernias instead optimal solution : prevention . A product call MYOSEAL currently develop prevent hernia formation abdominal surgery use fibrin tissue sealant silver particle prophylactically enhance early wound heal myofascial incision . The purpose phase 1 study examine safety apply MYOSEAL immediately abdominal wall suture closure patient undergoing abdominal surgery . The investigator expect apply product suture myofascial incision increase collagen formation wound thus prevent formation incisional hernia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Fibrin Sealant Plus Silver Microparticles Prevent Incisional Hernias Following Abdominal Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hernias area weakness muscle abdomen commonly develop people abdominal surgery . This area weakness often turn bulge protrusion increase size time , interfere intestine make difficult people work exercise . Many people undergo surgery fix hernia . Unfortunately , operation repair hernia frequently fail hernia return . The investigator develop material help body heal abdominal surgery thereby prevent incisional hernia form first place . This study first step test new material patient whether safe use . This study include patient type abdominal surgery . The test material call MYOSEAL ; combination tissue sealant call TISSEEL® ( Baxter Biosurgery , Deerfield , IL ) plus small particle metallic silver ( &lt; 250µ , American Elements , Los Angeles , CA ) . TISSEEL make naturally occur blood protein approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) use surgery since 1998 . But , TISSEEL approve prevent incisional hernia abdominal surgery . The silver particle approve FDA , think generally safe way use . This study hop learn help body well heal abdominal surgery . At conclusion laparotomy , 4-6 pair stainless steel clip ( large Horizon® titanium clip , Teleflex Medical , Research Triangle Park , NC ) attach opposite equally spaced edge suture myofascial incision , follow application MYOSEAL suture myofascial incision closure skin . Study participant examine 1 day , 1 month , 3 month , 6 month surgery . The primary endpoint include wound occurrence , include wound infection , seromas , hematomas postoperative complication 6 month follow surgery . The secondary endpoint incisional hernia rate 1 month determine distance metal clip mark myofascial edge use caliper plain abdominal radiograph .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The patient undergoing abdominal operation require incision ≥10cm length ; Age ≥21 ; Negative pregnancy test ; No allergic , religious ethical objection fibrin tissue sealant ( human blood protein ) , aprotinin metallic silver ; Signed informed consent take part study Lactating woman ; Patients unable commit follow evaluation 6 month ; Severe malnutrition ( serum albumin &lt; 2.0 ) ; Use investigational agent within 1 month prior study enrollment and/or plan study ; Immunocompromised patient , evidence : administration high dos corticosteroid ( i.e . dose ≥ 1.5 mg/kg/day prednisone equivalent ) within 72 hour study enrollment ; status post solid organ transplant bone marrow transplant AND experience acute organ rejection bone marrow failure rejection ; evidence neutropenia ( absolute neutrophil count ≤ 500 cells/mm3 ( ≤ 500 x 106 cells/L ) ; immunosuppression secondary immunomodulatory medication ( e.g . cyclosporin , azathioprine , OKT3 ) , chemotherapy radiation therapy within 90 day study enrollment ; know AIDS ; disease sufficiently advance suppress resistance infection ( include , limited leukemia , lymphoma hypogammaglobulinemia ) ; administration immunoglobulin GCSF within 90 day study enrollment ; Presence underlie disease/injury life expectancy less two year and/or severe underlying disease would preclude study entry ( e.g . know malignancy ) .</criteria>
