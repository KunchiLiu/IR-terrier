	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine treatment PLX3397 Sirolimus tolerate result shrink cancer stop cancer grow . In phase I portion , maximum tolerate dose study drug determine . In Phase II portion , progression free survival assess dose level find Phase I . Participants continue take study drug experience unacceptable side effect disease progress .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PLX3397 Plus Sirolimus Unresectable Sarcoma Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor ( MPNSTs ) represent 10 % adult soft tissue sarcoma . Due rarity , MPNST-specific prospective trial exist , treatment largely base extrapolation result sarcoma subtypes . Since molecular pathway drive pathogenesis within sarcoma subtypes distinct , treatment option likely suboptimal best . Targeted therapy block key pathway know drive MPNST likely result superior tumor response limited toxicity .</detailed_description>

Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status : 0 , 1 , 2 Age great equal 18 year . Because dose adverse event data currently available use PLX3397 combination sirolimus patient &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study , eligible future pediatric trial . Presence measurable lesion Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) v1.1 Allowable laboratory value date range ANC ≥1.5 X 10^9/L , Hgb &gt; 9 g/dL , platelet count ≥100 X 10^9/L AST/ALT ≤ upper limit normal ( ULN ) &lt; 2.5X ULN presence liver metastasis , bilirubin ≤ 1.5 ULN , albumin ≥ 3.0g/dL . Bilirubin ≤ ULN ; patient hyperbilirubinemia clinically consistent inherit disorder bilirubin metabolism ( e.g. , Gilbert syndrome ) eligible discretion principal investigator . Albumin ≥ 3.0g/dL . Creatinine ≤ 1.5 X ULN calculate creatinine clearance ( CrCl ) &gt; 60 mL/min use CockcroftGault formula less eight day pior start treatment . Women childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test screening must agree use effective form contraception time negative pregnancy test minimum 3 month last dose study drug . Effective form contraception include abstinence , hormonal contraceptive ( injectable implantable ) conjunction barrier method , double barrier method . Women nonchildbearing potential must postmenopausal ≥ 1 year surgically sterile . The effect PLX3397 sirolimus develop human fetus unknown . For reason woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Men treat enrol protocol must also agree use adequate contraception prior study , duration study participation , 3 month completion PLX3397 sirolimus administration . Fertile men must agree use effective method birth control study 3 month last dose study drug . Willingness ability provide write informed consent prior studyrelated procedure comply study requirement . Agree pre posttreatment tumor biopsy . Prior treatmentrelated Adverse Events must ≤ grade 1 ( CTCAE v4.0 ) , except alopecia , time initiate study drug . Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier within 14 day cycle 1 day 1 PLX3397 sirolimus . Patients receive investigational agent concurrently . Concomitant treatment antineoplastic agent ( hormonal therapy acceptable ) . Patients symptomatic brain metastasis . Subjects untreated brain metastasis ≤ 1 cm consider eligible deem asymptomatic investigator upon consultation medical monitor require immediate radiation steroid . Subjects brain metastasis treat stable 1 month may consider eligible asymptomatic stable dose steroid require steroid follow successful local therapy . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition PLX3397 sirolimus . For Phase 2 Prior exposure receptor tyrosine kinase mammalian target Rapamycin inhibitor . Pregnant woman exclude study PLX3397 sirolimus agent potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother PLX3397 sirolimus , breastfeed discontinue mother treated PLX3397 sirolimus . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , active liver disease , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Active secondary malignancy unless malignancy expect interfere evaluation safety approve Sponsor . Examples latter include basal squamous cell carcinoma skin , insitu carcinoma cervix , isolated elevation prostatespecific antigen . Subjects completely treat prior malignancy evidence disease ≥ 2 year eligible . Major surgical procedure significant traumatic injury within 14 day initiate study drug anticipation need major surgery study . Previous radiotherapy 25 % bone marrow and/or radiation therapy within 28 day prior study entry . Inability swallow capsule , refractory nausea vomiting , malabsorption , external biliary shunt , significant bowel resection would preclude adequate absorption . Congestive heart failure ( CHF ) New York ( NY ) Heart Association class III IV ; unstable coronary artery disease ( myocardial infarction [ MI ] 6 month prior study entry permit ) ; serious cardiac arrhythmia . Baseline QTcF ≥ 450 m ( male ) ≥ 470 m ( female ) HIVpositive patient combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction PLX3997 . In addition , patient increase risk lethal infection treat marrow suppressive therapy . Similarly , patient chronic acute hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) infection also ineligible . Of five major CYP isoforms , 3A4 ( BFC ) may involve Phase I metabolism PLX3397 , possibly CYP1A2 play minor role . Until information regard exposure toxicity exposureresponse relationship available PLX3397 , concomitant strong CYP3A4 inhibitor inducer permit event alter systemic exposure PLX3397 ( see Attachment 1 list common CYP3A4 inhibitor inducer ) . These include anticonvulsant , mycin antimicrobial , antiretrovirals . Some common example include inhibitor erythromycin , fluoxetine , gemfibrozil , inducer rifampicin , carbamazepine , phenytoin , efavirenz , nevirapine . Concomitant treatment permit medication expect interfere evaluation safety efficacy study drug . During study , use concomitant treatment becomes necessary ( e.g. , treatment adverse event ) , treatment must record eCRF , include reason treatment , generic name drug , dosage , route , start stop date administration . Sirolimus undergoes extensive hepatic intestinal metabolism via CYP3A4 CYP3A5 , well excretion Pglycoprotein . Strong CYP3A inhibitor ketoconazole grapefruit juice permit . Patients monitor supratherapeutic toxic level sirolimus PLX3397 . As bone marrow suppression include anemia , neutropenia , thrombocytopenia report patient receive sirolimus monotherapy , adverse effect may exacerbate combination PLX3397 patient closely monitor .
