	<brief_title>360° - Video Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An estimate 10-11 % US population experience specific phobia point life ( American Psychiatric Association , 1994 ; Magee et al. , 1996 ) . About 60-85 % individual specific phobia never seek treatment ( Agras , Sylvester , &amp; Oliveau , 1969 ; Boyd et al. , 1990 ; Magee et al. , 1996 ) . Clinical psychologist help improve number phobia sufferer seek treatment . Advances technology help clinician create novel treatment strategy different anxiety disorder . Virtual reality exposure therapy ( VRET ) may help individual confront fear treat phobia . While virtual reality exposure therapy show promise research ( Powers &amp; Emmelkamp , 2008 ) , study show many user complain computer generate virtual reality ( VR ) stimuli look unrealistic , eccentric much like video game ( Kwon , Powell , &amp; Chalmers , 2013 ) . Virtual reality environment traditionally create programmer use video game asset computer generate imagery ( CGI ) . While CGI use make intricate virtual environment , unless team expert digital artist , virtual stimulus may end look rudimentary exhibit number graphical glitch could prove distract therapy . Furthermore CGI often suffer uncanny valley effect : tendency CGI representation people view unsettling representation become lifelike . In addition many current CGI virtual reality package expensive available limited number fear domain . Recently however exciting alternative traditional computer generate virtual reality emerge : 360° Video VR . 360° Video VR radical filmmaking technology turn live action footage 360° environment user interact . 360° Video VR make film array multiple HD camera carefully arrange capture angle 360° area live action event . Then angle stitch together post-production 360° texture sphere sphere map head tracker user HDM . Leading effect user turn head , view live action video footage turn real time ( e.g . user look , camera pan user see floor ) allow user look around anywhere 360° filmed footage live action event . The benefit 360° video VR oppose CGI VR photo realistic , suffer uncanny valley effect CGI , able capture nuance real life fear hard reproduce CGI .</detailed_description>
