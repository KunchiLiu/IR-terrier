	<brief_title>Phase 1 TAK-915 Single-Dose Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) Occupancy Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug test study call TAK-915 . TAK-915 test examine degree duration brain phosphodiesterase 2A ( PDE2A ) enzyme occupancy/target engagement function TAK-915 plasma concentration order guide dose schedule future clinical study schizophrenia . This study look PDE2A brain enzyme occupancy putamen function TAK-915 plasma concentration , assess use positron emission tomography ( PET ) ligand [ 18F ] MNI-794 single dose TAK-915 . The study enroll approximately 16 patient total within total , allow 5 dose level 6 subject per dose level . All participant receive single dose TAK-915 Day 1 . The initial TAK-915 dose level study 100 mg . Subsequent dose level may lower high determine dose level review meeting ( DLRMs ) follow approximately every 2 participant base prior occupancy , duration occupancy , safety , tolerability , available pharmacokinetic ( PK ) data . This single center trial conduct United States . The overall time participate study 55 day . Participants make multiple visit clinic , contact telephone 22 day last dose study drug follow-up assessment .</detailed_description>
