	<brief_summary>Prostate Cancer ( PCa ) common male cancer Denmark number increase . Annually , 1,600 men refer Department Urology , Herlev Gentofte Hospital , due elevate PSA ( Prostate Specific Antigen ) clinical symptom suspicious PCa . In approximately 50 % patient , PCa diagnose base histopathological finding tissue obtain transrectal ultrasound biopsy ( TRUS-bx ) . The TRUS-bx take 10 standard zone prostate . If PCa lesion visualize TRUS , appear hypo-echoic compare normal peripheral zone . But 40-50 % cancerous lesion iso-echoic thus difficult identify . Furthermore , benign prostate hyperplasia ( BPH ) transitional zone make difficult locate tumour . Therefore , risk miss significant cancer incorrect grade tumor aggressiveness ( Gleason score ) TRUS-bx . Thus , 10 systematic biopsy always representative whole gland . In addition , many men harbour small in-significant cancer focus , never cause patient morbidity mortality . It often best detect small insignificant tumour focus due risk overtreatment . If MRI perform decision biopsy make , patient might diagnose insignificant PCa since MRI mainly find significant cancer . The Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( mp-MRI ) seem accurate detection localization PCa accord clinical study several study show mp-MRI able distinguish patient significant insignificant PCa . As mp-MRI visualizes whole gland identify suspicious cancerous region use guide targeted biopsy . Also , potential decrease number biopsy 10 standard biopsy replace 1-4 MRI target biopsy . Furthermore , patient might need biopsy MRI show suspect focus , thereby decrease risk complication biopsy-procedure . In theory mp-MRI could use determine patient need biopsied - sort screen tool . The current standard examination take 45-60 minute . This long costly screen procedure . Based investigator three year long experience , choose two scan sequence one calculate sequence , believe answer question : Is significant cancer present ? This biparametric-MRI ( bp-MRI ) take 20-25 minute involve administrate MRI standard drug . The chosen sequence : T2-weighted ( T2W ) image axial plane , diffusion weight ( DWI ) axial image multiple b-values calculation apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC ) -map . If , hand , MRI use stag purpose , six sequence need : T2W image 3 plane ( axial , coronal sagittal ) , DWI axial image multiple b-values plus calculation apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC ) -map Dynamic Contrast Enhancement ( DCE ) T1-weighted ( T1W ) . This call multiparametric MRI ( mp-MRI ) . The two T2W sequence coronal sagittal plane leave mainly add information staging purpose . The hypothesis two necessary , investigator want determine whether sign significant cancer . Neither DCE use contrast medium necessary indicate whether post-biopsy-blood present case patient group . The bp-MRI le detailed , detail important use MRI PCa detection . Studies show ADC-map calculate DWI correlate Gleason score may use non-invasive measure cancer aggressiveness . In summary , bp-MRI design determine whether significant cancer present , able ass stage cancer ( extension capsule invasion vesiculae seminalis urethra/bladder neck ) . As previously state , half patient refer due suspicion PCa PCa need undergo normal mp-MRI scan . In case high-risk patient ( &gt; cT2b , Gleason score &gt; 7 PSA &gt; 20 ( group 2 ) ) stag necessary normal mp-MRI performed .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Can Significant Prostate Cancer Be Detected With Biparametric MRI ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose To study whether simple non-contrast enhance bp-MRI prostate last 20-25 min . identify significant cancer . Trial subject Annually , 1,600 male suspect PCa refer Department Urology Herlev Gentofte Hospital . They invite undergo short bp-MRI fulfil inclusion criterion . Study Design A prospective observational study subject offer undergo short bp-MRI prostate biopsy . At referral patient receives letter appointment consultation urologists nurse . This current standard patient . The patient interview patient record follow physical examination include DRE . If persistent suspicion PCa patient invite participate study : patient ( group 1 ) receive information project , informed consent form appointment bp-MRI . The patient give 24+ hour consider participation study . If decide participate must sign consent form bp-MRI . The form hand radiographer arrive bp-MRI . If patient want participate study , bp-MRI appointment cancel . If surgeon suspect high-risk cancer ( group 2 ) , patient refer mp-MRI ( standard procedure today ) ; patient ask allows inclusion mp-MRI study [ 18 ] . All patient protocol undergo current standard 10 biopsy plus one two biopsy significant lesion diagnose bp-MRI mp-MRI . The enrolled patient follow 4 year diagnosis cancer , treatment recurrence , metastasis PSA-level . After scan do work investigation : Correlation bp-MRI/mp-MRI histopathology Correlation bp-MRI/mp-MRI clinical outcome 1 year Correlation bp-MRI/mp-MRI clinical outcome 5 year</detailed_description>
