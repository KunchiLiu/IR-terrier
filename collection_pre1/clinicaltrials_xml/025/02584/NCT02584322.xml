	<brief_summary>Currently , CHUM - Notre-Dame Hospital , standardize patient care pathway patient undergo Video Assisted Thoracic Surgery ( VATS ) lobectomy . The investigator goal implement Enhanced Recovery Program ( ERP ) patient undergo VATS lobectomy . The care give patient prior implementation protocol different amongst patient depend surgeon 's preference . The implementation ERP permit reproducible routine management patient follow surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fast Tracking VATS Lobectomy : A Prospective , Historically Controlled , Propensity-Matched Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lung cancer common cause cancer relate death men woman worldwide annually . In North America 2009 , estimate 246,000 people diagnosed lung cancer , 178,000 die result . Lobectomy consist surgical removal anatomic lobe lung . It represent standard care treatment malignant lesion involve one lobe lung . This operation perform either chest incision rib spreading ( thoracotomy ) minimally invasive approach include rib spreading ( thoracoscopy - Video Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery ; VATS ) . In last decade , trend towards implementation protocol enhance patient recovery diminish length stay gain popularity increase prevalence . Those protocol commonly refer fast track surgery enhance recovery surgery protocol . The rationale behind protocol combine multimodal therapy reduce surgical stress , good pain control post-operatively , involve patient process , treat team potential reduce length stay . In last year , many surgeon respective center implement use fast track surgery thoracic surgery service . It show safe effective method manage postoperative patient lobectomy . Fast track surgery systemic approach management surgical patient , different action take postoperatively standardize reproducible . Fast track surgery potential diminish rate postoperative complication , length stay , achieve similar patient recovery . In era , medical cost rise , hospital bed limit nursing staff always available , fast track surgery potential improve increase throughput , improve efficiency , decrease cost improve surgical productivity . Currently , CHUM - Notre-Dame Hospital , standardize patient care pathway patient undergo VATS lobectomy . The care give patient prior implementation protocol different amongst patient depend surgeon 's preference . The implementation Enhanced Recovery Program ( ERP ) permit reproducible routine management patient follow surgery . The principal outcome compare amongst patient pre post implementation protocol length stay number complication . The investigator think result different two group . The rational due fact patient Enhanced Recovery Program : ( 1 ) urinary catheter remove sooner , ( 2 ) thoracic drain remove earlier ( 3 ) mobilize quickly . These difference enable patient potentially less complication post operatively decrease hospital stay .</detailed_description>
