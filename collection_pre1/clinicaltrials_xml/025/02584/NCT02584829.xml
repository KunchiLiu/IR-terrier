	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study side effect well localize radiation therapy recombinant interferon beta avelumab without cellular adoptive immunotherapy work treat patient Merkel cell carcinoma spread part body . Radiation therapy use high energy x-ray kill tumor cell shrink tumor . Interferon beta substance improve body 's natural response may interfere growth tumor cell . Monoclonal antibody , avelumab , may help T lymphocyte kill tumor cell . For cellular adoptive immunotherapy , specific white blood cell collect patient 's blood treat laboratory recognize Merkel cell carcinoma . Infusing cell back patient may help body build effective immune response kill Merkel cell carcinoma . Giving localized radiation therapy recombinant interferon beta avelumab without cellular adoptive immunotherapy may better treatment Merkel cell carcinoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Localized Radiation Therapy Recombinant Interferon Beta Avelumab With Without Cellular Adoptive Immunotherapy Treating Patients With Metastatic Merkel Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess compare safety potential toxicity associate treat patient metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma ( MCC ) either major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) regulation program cell death 1 ( PD1 ) -axis blockade ( Group 1 ) , MHC up-regulation , PD1-axis blockade adoptive transfer Merkel cell polyoma virus ( MCPyV ) T antigen ( TAg ) -specific polyclonal autologous cluster differentiation ( CD ) 8+ T cell ( Group 2 ) . II . Assess compare antitumor efficacy associate treat patient metastatic MCC either MHC up-regulation PD1-axis blockade ( Group 1 ) , MHC up-regulation , PD1-axis blockade adoptive transfer MCPyV TAg-specific polyclonal autologous CD8+ T cell ( Group 2 ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Examine vivo persistence , evaluable , migration tumor site adoptively transfer polyclonal CD8+ T cell target MCPyV TAg ( Group 2 ) . II . Examine vivo functional capacity adoptively transfer polyclonal CD8+ T cell target MCPyV Tag ( Group 2 ) . III . Examine compare evidence epitope spread either MHC up-regulation adoptive transfer MHC up-regulation PD1-axis blockade ( Group 1 ) , MHC regulation , PD1-axis blockade adoptive transfer MCPyV TAg-specific polyclonal autologous CD8+ T cell ( Group 2 ) . OUTLINE : Patients human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) type T cell generate T cell generate technical issue assign Group 1 . Patients HLA type T cell generate assigned Group 2 . GROUP 1 : Patients receive avelumab intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour every 2 week 12 month . Within 7-10 day completion 1-3 dos avelumab , patient receive MHC class I up-regulation intervention comprise either localized radiation therapy recombinant interferon beta via intra-tumor injection . GROUP 2 : Patients receive avelumab IV 1 hour every 2 week 12 month . Patients also receive MHC class I up-regulation intervention Group 1 7-10 day first infusion avelumab 2-5 day first infusion MCPyV TAg-specific polyclonal autologous CD8+ T cell . Patients receive two infusion MCPyV TAg-specific polyclonal autologous CD8+ T cell IV 60-120 minute . In group , MHC class I up-regulation treatment without T cell infusion may repeat indicate . After completion study treatment , patient follow 12 month periodically thereafter .</detailed_description>
