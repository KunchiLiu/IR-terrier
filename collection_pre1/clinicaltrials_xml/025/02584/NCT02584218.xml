	<brief_summary>This study aim evaluate , control clinical randomized study , effectiveness seal carious lesion composite resin primary molar . For , healthy child ( n=100 ) caries lesion reach middle third dentin primary molar , submit different treatment remove lesion . These patient randomly allocate follow treatment group : ( 1 ) cavity seal ( Non-invasive resin base dental sealing ) without caries removal ; ( 2 ) Partial caries removal Invasive resin base restoration . The clinical radiographic success treatment group verify periodic examination restoration USPHS criterion radiographic subtraction , respectively , check progression injury . The researcher responsible assessment blind study , whose evaluation occur 6 , 12 , 24 36 month treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The present study carry randomized clinical study . Primary , occlusal caries lesion child , age 3-8 year old treat non-invasive resin base sealing ( n= 50 ) resin base restoration ( n=50 ) . Randomization seal restoration ( 1:1 ) make resercher Federal University Rio de Janeiro keep clinic seal envelope . The treatment examine clinically radiographically 6 , 12 , 24 36 year . The treatment perform controlled one practitioner ( main reseacher study ) Federal University Rio de Janeiro , Brazil . Sealing : The dentist use resin base sealing , follow usual clinical procedure base instruction manufacturer guideline Department Pediatric Dentistry Orthodontics Federal University Rio de Janeiro , Brazil . Restoration : The dentist use preparation design resin base resin restoration , follow usual clinical procedure ( partial caries removal ) base instruction manufacturer guideline Department Pediatric Dentistry Orthodontics Federal University Rio de Janeiro , Brazil . The prevalence regression , arrest progression seal restored caries lesion , compute related clinical radiological registration child , treatment related factor assess statistically significant correlation . The influence factor longevity need retreatment occlusal sealant restoration , assess use apropriate analysis statistical treatment data .</detailed_description>
