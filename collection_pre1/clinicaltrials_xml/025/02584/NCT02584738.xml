	<brief_title>Nebulized Magnesium Sulfate Adjunct Standard Therapy Asthma Exacerbation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The inclusion period patient research September 2015 November 2015 . Patients go select medical staff duty emergency paediatric service , accord criterion previously establish inclusion exclusion . Immediately baseline degree respiratory distress use PRAM scale heart rate , respiratory rate , blood pressure oxygen saturation . While informed consent objective characteristic study obtain explain . Patients randomly assign one two treatment Research : standard treatment moderate severe asthma attack , accord GINA standard treatment plus nebulised magnesium sulphate , accord table random allocation treatment . Evaluations perform administration spray , , 20 , 40 , 60 , 120 , 180 240 minute begin treatment . The parameter ' evaluate go heart rate , respiratory rate , oxygen saturation , blood pressure assessment severity acute asthma PRAM scale . The application nebulized drug make emergency department pediatrics inhalation therapy staff also responsible preparation medicine . It clear staff participate evaluation patient , perform research staff medical staff duty pediatric emergency department . Patients evaluate physician pick two solution nebulization colour also smell special feature , solution arrange two identical syrinx . Administered alone end study treatment know . Later entry exit patient decide , egress show clinical improvement decrease severity index PRAM , patient graduate outpatient treatment accord international guideline management acute asthma . All initial outcome data record format data collection All decision make patient pediatrician emergency department follow patient throughout study power release study patient use intervention consider clinically necessary</detailed_description>
