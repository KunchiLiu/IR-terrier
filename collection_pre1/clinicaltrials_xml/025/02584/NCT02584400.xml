	<brief_summary>Regulation tissue oxygen homeostasis critical cell function , proliferation survival . Evidence continue accumulate along understand complex oxygen-sensing pathway present within cell . Several pathophysiological disorder associate loss oxygen homeostasis , include heart disease , stroke , cancer . The microenvironment tumor particular oxygen heterogeneous , hypoxic area may explain difficulty treat cancer effectively . Prostate carcinomas know hypoxic . Increasing level hypoxia within prostatic tissue relate increase clinical stage , patient age aggressive prostate cancer . Several research indicate hypoxia might also play role esophageal cancer . In glial brain tumor , hypoxia correlate rapid tumor recurrence hypoxic burden newly diagnose glioblastoma link biological aggressiveness . In brain metastasis CA-IX expression ( marker hypoxia ) correlate primary non-small cell lung carcinoma . Hypoxia enhance proliferation , angiogenesis , metastasis , chemoresistance radioresistance hepatocellular carcinoma . The hypoxic marker HIF-1Î± , VEGF , CA-IX GLUT-1 express colorectal cancer liver metastasis . Based literature , hypoxia tumor originate disseminated prostate , esophagus , brain rectum cancer study trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tumor Hypoxia With HX4 PET Several Diseases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Non-invasive image hypoxia aid PET-scans could help select patient hypoxic tumor , could treat specific anti-hypoxic treatment . The added value additional anti-hypoxic treatment depend presence hypoxia adequate patient selection . Several 2-nitroimidazoles , label Fluor-18 ( 18F ) already use patient identify hypoxia . However , suboptimal image quality unpredictable kinetics limit use . In extensive pre-clinical model clinical trial combination HX4 label 18F show promising non-toxic new probe determine hypoxia . With tracer proportion hypoxic tumor several cancer type verify . Objective : Determine tumor hypoxia accurately visualize [ 18F ] HX4 solid lesion . Study design : Phase II , several solid tumor , single-centre , imaging , non-randomized , open label trial . Study population : Main patient characteristic : - Histological/cytological confirm carcinoma de esophagus , rectum prostate radiological suspicion Grade IV glioma ( primary brain tumor ) brain metastasis . - WHO performance status 0 2 - Adequate renal function ( calculated creatinine clearance least 60 ml/min ) . - Capable comply study procedure Main intervention : In addition standard clinical care patient receive two additional PET scan injection hypoxia tracer [ 18F ] HX4 . Main study parameters/endpoints : - Visualization quantification tumor hypoxia [ 18F ] HX4 PET image - Exploring potential relationship [ 18F ] HX4 uptake local locoregional tumor recurrence survival - Correlation hypoxia image blood hypoxia marker - Correlation hypoxia image tumor tissue biomarkers - Evaluation tumor hypoxia change treatment . - Spatial correlation [ 18F ] HX4-PET image pre-treatment ( present routine clinical practice ) - Spatial correlation [ 18F ] HX4-PET imaging three month treatment ( present routine clinical practice ) - Quantitative qualitative correlation [ 18F ] HX4-PET obtain treatment two week treatment Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : The radiation burden due [ 18F ] HX4 similar encounter many routine nuclear medicine procedure e.g . [ 18F ] FDG PET . Administration [ 18F ] HX4 present known risk . In previous study ( healthy volunteer , phase I , phase II ) adverse effect observe . There immediate potential benefit except satisfaction participate improve knowledge .</detailed_description>
