	<detailed_description>The clinical , social financial burden Autism Spectrum Disorder ( ASD ) stagger . They prevalent developmental disorder incidence rise . However , ASD phenotype variability large , ASD symptoms manifest range age different degree . In part reason , ASD clinical diagnosis challenge often make 3-5 year age . Thus , remain unmet need valid reliable endophenotype would facilitate ASD diagnosis early life , enable efficient study ASD risk factor , eventually serve useful biomarker inform development effective therapy assess treatment response future clinical trial . The overarch goal proposal explore utility transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) measure brain plasticity novel neurophysiologic endophenotype high- low-functioning adult child ASD . Investigators ' work date demonstrate potential utility measure higher-functioning adult ASD , pilot data support feasibility safety apply measure child low function individual value endophenotype would particularly high . Investigators thus propose apply single-pulse TMS evaluate modulation corticospinal reactivity induce specific repetitive TMS protocol know theta burst stimulation ( TBS ) . The comparison motor response induce single-pulse TMS follow TBS unique noninvasive measure brain plasticity human , investigator find show reliable abnormality high-functioning adult individual ASD . Each subject 's participation study consist three visit : screen visit two identical study visit 1-3 week apart . Each visit last approximately 2 hour . During first study visit participant provide informed consent . patient receive thorough medical history neurological physical exam license physician training pediatric medicine . This evaluate underlying neurological disorder would exclusionary ( e.g . motor impairment , epilepsy , medication contraindication etc . ) All subject also complete neuropsychological evaluation include IQ ASD specific evaluation . If eligible continue , participant return within two week undergo first TMS evaluation . The TMS procedure repeat 1-3 week later . The two identical TMS study visit aim address reliability TMS-based measure : Investigators hypothesize TMS measure consistent across session within study group ( ASD control , adult child , low- high-functioning individual ) . Such test-retest reliability data critical explore utility TMS measure potential marker diagnosis therapeutic efficacy intervention . Investigators thus anticipate data propose study address important need rapid , noninvasive , reliable safe endophenotype available patient ASD across age level function .</detailed_description>
