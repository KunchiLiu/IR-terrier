	<brief_summary>CARDIOPROOF proof-of-concept project consolidate outcomes previous virtual physiological human ( VPH ) project check applicability effectiveness available predictive modelling simulation tool , validate interrelated clinical trial conduct three European centre excellence cardiac treatment ( Germany , Italy UK ) . CARDIOPROOF focus patient aortic valve disease aortic coarctation , , leave untreated , ensue irreversible heart failure . As result treatment become mandatory , optimum timing best type treatment still remain difficult determine . With 50.000 intervention per year within EU , diseases addressed CARDIOPROOF significant socio-economic impact . Present clinical guideline highly complex rely mostly image diagnostics clinical parameter , without benefiting , yet , patient-specific disease model base prediction . CARDIOPROOF go beyond current state art conduct validation trial aim cover compare complete spectrum cardiovascular treatment , predict evolution disease immediate mid-term outcome treatment . Operational cluster go provide seamless clinical solution applies different model method realize potential personalised medicine take account user-friendliness key component clinical usability . CARDIOPROOF 's goal provide first-hand data comparative cost-effectiveness clinical efficacy advance VPH approach compare conventional diagnostics treatment algorithm , thus accelerate deployment VPH method clinical environment , bring maturity holistic patient-specific computer-based predictive model simulation .</brief_summary>
