	<brief_title>Treatment Hypertension In Adults With ThiaZIDES : Pragmatic Trial Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For several decade , U.S. hypertension treatment guideline recommend low-dose diuretic hydrochlorothiazide ( HCTZ ) chlorthalidone ( CTD ) initial monotherapy stepped-care approach part initial two-drug combination . In numerous large clinical trial , CTD-based regimen significantly reduce rate cardiovascular event stroke , heart failure , cardiovascular mortality compare placebo , usual care , active comparators . In contrast , outcome study compare HCTZ-based regimen treatment , generally find HCTZ less effective non-thiazide comparators prevent cardiovascular event . The two drug never compare directly large trial . Despite empirical evidence favor CTD , HCTZ much widely use clinical practice . The propose R34 pilot study conduct two large integrated health system test method feasibility eventual pragmatic randomize trial compare effectiveness HCTZ CTD prevent cardiovascular event mortality . Using cluster-randomized design , investigator allocate 40 primary care physician adult hypertensive patient currently use HCTZ ( N=2,000 ) either convert HCTZ user CTD ( intervention group ) continue HCTZ ( usual care group ) . The pilot study plan full-scale trial use exist health care infrastructure electronic health record identify eligible study subject , distribute study medication , collect operational outcome data . For pilot study , Aim 1 document intervention deliver intend . Aim 2 compare safety intervention usual care patient . Aim 3 refine pilot study design identify critical factor intervention success use mixed-methods approach . Aim 4 refine estimate sample size . Finally , Aim 5 determine cost ascertain outcomes estimate per-participant cost full-scale trial . The pilot study produce data necessary sufficient inform plan full-scale trial compare CTD CTZ advance development method pragmatic trial .</detailed_description>
