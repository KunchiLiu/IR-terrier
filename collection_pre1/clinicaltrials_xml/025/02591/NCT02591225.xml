	<brief_title>Left Atrial Thrombus Reduction - Effect Dabigatran Versus Phenprocoumon</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bakground study rationale : Left atrial ( LA ) thrombus find 2.5 - 18 % subject atrial fibrillation ( AF ) depend subject population . Subjects LA thrombus particularly increase risk cerebral peripheral embolism . Consequently , oral anticoagulation recommend subject . Transesophageal echocardiography ( TEE ) suit capable visualize deecting LA thrombus . Cranial magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) high accurancy detect ailent cerebral mircoembolism . However , continue effective anticoagulation vitamin K antagonist ( VKA ) Phenprocoumon show 56 % LA thrombus resolve 12 month TEE observational period . At 1 month 16 % thrombus disappear . However , cureent treatment guideline recommend 4 week effective anticoagulation prior cardioversion , independent LA thrombus . In subject population 84 % LA thrombus would still present 4 week VKA therapy thus , would increase risk thromboembolism , cardioversion , accordance current guideline , would perform . It well know thrombin play central role formation , growth , maintenance , consolidation thrombus . Direct thrombin inhibition show block process lead inhibition thrombus . In vivo , show reduce 90 % preform , half-hour-old-thrombus . This effect probably due good inhibition catalytically active clot-bound thrombin . Newer oral anticoagulant , like direct thrombin inhibitor Dabigatran therefore promise resolution LA thrombus comparison VKA , investigate previously . Efficacy variable : Expliration possible difference reduction leave atrial thrombus size evaluate TEE ( primary ) silent cerebral embolism ( secondary ) detect cranial MRI baseline anf 12 month treat period Phenprocoumon Dabigatran order gain mire detail information generate valid hypothesis clinical trial . Overview : This single-center , randomize , two treatment group , open , phase IV clinical study subject atrial fibrillation leave atrial thrombus . At visit 0 ( Screening visit ) subject leave atrial thrombus establish TEE eligable entry study . If subject fulfill in- exclusion criterion undersign informed consent baseline cranial MRI perform follwoed randomization one two treatment group ( Phenprocoumon Dabigatran ) Visit 1 ( Baseline visit ) . The subject treat 12 month Phenprocoumon ( INR adjust daily ) Dabigatran 150 mg twice daily . Routinly clinical follow visit bill do week 4 , month 3 , month 6 , month 9 month 12 . Follow TEE perform week 4 month 12 also follow cranial MRI visit . If subject randomize VKA group routinely INR measurement perform .</detailed_description>
