	<brief_summary>A hot topic lung transplantation treatment persist sinus disease/colonization CF patient prevent descend graft colonization chronic allograft dysfunction . From 2012 , Hannover transplantation group use conservative approach topical nasal inhalation . It necessary analyse impact new approach graft colonization , incidence BOS , symptom , QoL etc comparison historical cohort . It also important establish best among different inhale antibiotic regimen currently available .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>These patient undergo frequent individual centre base follow care . At follow visit , patient : - receive comprehensive clinical examination , history intercurrent infection sinus surgery - receive quantitative assessment , consist spirometry ( perform accord ATS/ERS guideline ) , arterial blood gas analysis , measurement immunosuppressive drug level chest radiograph - receive questionnaire ( quality life ( SNOT-20 GAV ) , side effect sinus inhalation , symptom score ) - ask collect sample nasal lavage ; sample BAL ( obtain routinely perform bronchoscopy ) also collect . These specimen analyse microbiological work evaluation inflammatory marker . The principle vibrate inhalation implement novel nebulizer , sinonasal inhalation perform aerolized medication one nostril , contralateral nostril occlude soft palate elevate recommended nasal lavage . The medication administer nostrils 4-6 min side phase arrest breathing . Choice antibiotic depend resistance test microbiological result . Patients divide different group , basis inhale antibiotic regimen choose : colistin vs. tobramycin . An alternate therapy hypertonic saline may apply improve sinus clearance . All regimen administer machine , i.e . PARI Sinus â„¢ nebulizer , , unlike conventional aerosol , allow deposition drug directly paranasal sinus . The aim study : - ass sinus - pulmonary colonization cystic fibrosis ( CF ) lung transplant ( LuTx ) recipient ( frequency pathogen colonization ; load ; bacterial specie ) - study association clinical event ( e.g . infection development bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome ( BOS ) ) - develop optimal inhale regimen ( continuous inhalation/on-off regimen ; single combine antibiotic ) . - compare cohort receive sinus surgery historical control cohort receive current conservative strategy ( since 2012 ) sinonasal vibrate inhalation antibiotic , term graft colonization , quality life , overall survival , incidence chronic lung allograft dysfunction - compare inflammatory mediator upper low airway lavages regard pathogen colonization , lung function development BOS</detailed_description>
