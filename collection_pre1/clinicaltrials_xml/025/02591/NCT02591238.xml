	<detailed_description>Trial title : The protective effect melatonin smoke-induced vascular injury human Protocol : Investigators recruit eligible Han Chinese participant ( age 25-39 ) smoking least 10 cigarette per day least 1 year . Participants exclude undergone cardiovascular disease , systolic blood pressure 140 mm Hg , diastolic blood pressure 90 mmHg , psychiatric disorder , cancer , pregnant , lactating , take antipsychotic drug orally 2 week trial . They randomly divide participant non-smoking oral placebo , non-smoking oral melatonin , smoke oral placebo , smoke oral melatonin . They oral melatonin 3 mg/day placebo 2 week . Blood sample ( 3 milliliter ) take baseline 2 week treatment . Through series hospital clinical laboratory relate ELISA kit detect endothelial cell injury serum marker platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 ( PECAM-1/CD31 ) ， intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( ICAM - 1 ) , vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ( VCAM 1 ) , endothelin-1 ( ET-1 ) , endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( eNOS ) , nuclear erythroid 2-related factor 2 ( Nrf - 2 ) , NAD ( P ) H quinone oxidoreductase-1 ( NQO-1 ) , catalytic glutamate cysteine ligase ( GCLC ) , heme oxygenase-1 ( HO-1 ) , free fatty acid ( FFA ) , total cholesterol ( TC ) , triglyceride ( TG ) , low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) , hypersensitive c-reactive protein ( hsCRP ) , fibrinogen ( Fbg ) , free fatty acid ( FFA ) , vascular endothelial damage index analysis whether melatonin protective effect smoke-induced vascular injury . All participant study investigator unaware treatment allocation throughout trial . This trial approve Ethical Committee Peking Union Medical College Hospital ( No JS-863 ) . All participant complete questionnaire sign informed consent document . Otherwise , get appropriate economic compensation . To achieve treatment concealment , melatonin placebo appearance package identically . Trial associate monitor compliance masking procedure throughout trial . All participant study investigator unaware treatment allocation throughout study . The randomization code remain sealed data collection cleaning , completion mask analysis . The study team monitor classify protocol deviation . Investigators summarize baseline clinical demographic characteristic descriptive statistic determine Univariate Analysis Variance . All data analysis do use statistical software SPSS 20.0 . Expected result : Compared smoker oral placebo , melatonin 3 mg/day may alleviate smoke-induced vascular injury . Consent document : The potential risk , research treatment drug melatonin may delay metabolism antipsychotic antipsychotic drug , investigator recruit psychiatric disorder take antipsychotic drug orally 2 week trial exclusion . As Health care medicine . Melatonin suitable child , investigator select recruit participant age 25 39 . The measure minimize risk , fully inform participant family trial 's advantage , disadvantage desire effect . All participant totally agree subject . In process , least three effective way get contact medical staff doctor ensure unexpected accident deserve effective tackle . Examination every participant start trial guarantee comply criterion . Our research involve application melatonin china food drug administration ( CFDA ) approve ensure safety ( include chemical composition , structure , content parameter , main raw material appropriate crowd ) . All staff qualify medical professional guarantee safety participant . The potential risk discomfort , inconvenience , benefit participant : So far , effective melatonin human include regulate sleep , anti-tumor , immune regulation , regulate inflammation immune regulate blood lipid metabolism confirm . Adverse reaction slow delay antipsychotic drug metabolism ( nearly one month ago period trial participant take antipsychotic drug ) trial . The basic principle trial ensure safety participant . The relevant content consultation : Everyone right consultation research content telephone : +86 01069152500 ( principal investigator ) +86 01069155817 ( Ethics committee ) . The right withdraw trial : Participate trial completely voluntary . If reason , participant willing participate , wish continue participate trial , affect right interest participant . In addition , participant right withdraw trial time . If participant accord doctor instruction , sake health benefit , doctor researcher may also require participant quit trial . The compensation research : If participant unexpected accident relation trial , compensation responsibility provide Peking union medical college hospital . Privacy protection : The privacy every participant protect . The result trial academic publication leak information identify personal identity . Peking union medical college hospital save everybody 's data guarantee leak without authorization . Investigators declare compete interest .</detailed_description>
