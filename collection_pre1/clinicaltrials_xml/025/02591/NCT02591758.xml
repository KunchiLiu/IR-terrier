	<brief_summary>The first foremost manifestation ischemic heart disease ( IHD ) angina . At global level , patient chronic angina risk poor vital status deconditioning . Medical therapy coronary revascularization use coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) effectively relieve angina . In spite available treatment option , assessment angina remain challenge . Angina cyclical pattern naturally worsen improve day go . Likewise , angina significantly bias placebo effect . Clinically angina frequently quantify Canadian Cardiovascular Society ( CCS ) class system . In research protocol , angina often quantified health-related quality life questionnaires diary . None tool available account important phenomenon call ischemic threshold adaptation , could define limitation activity level ischemic level , translate few angina episode seemingly stable condition . Better clinical assessment tool take consideration ischemic threshold adaption need . Despite increased interest wearable biometrics clothe medicine , prospective study document utility ass angina monitor rehabilitation cardiac patient . The Hexoskin™ biometric vest collect physiological data individual natural daily living environment . Currently , use biometric clothing confine niche exploit exclusively health enthusiast , athlete astronauts . As enter new age virtual healthcare , tool like wearable biometrics could represent giant leap forward assist healthcare professional patient . This translate well assessment health status , allow physician target right treatment strategy , ultimately improve case-selection outcome . Our objective prospectively validate wearable biometrics clothe Hexoskin™ establish standard use assess chronic stable angina . In addition , investigator want derive novel vitality index data generate device subsequently use propose new angina classification system account ischemic threshold adaptation . Moreover , investigator want evaluate safety efficacy Hexoskin monitor patient undergo home-based cardiac rehabilitation .</brief_summary>
