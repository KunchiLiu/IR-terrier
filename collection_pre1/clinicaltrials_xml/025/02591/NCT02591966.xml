	<brief_title>Genetic Alteration After Systemic Treatment Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prospective single arm trial use three patient ' cohort . One-hundred patient cohort total 300 patient ( 600 biopsy sample ) enter trial . The hypothesis genomic alteration measure CancerSCAN cfDNA , Whole exome sequencing ( WES ) , Whole transcriptome sequencing ( WTS ) , FACS ( Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting ) , cytokine immunologic signature analysis would different pre- post-menopausal woman would predictive biomarkers cohort accord pre- post-menopausal status . Three group patient recruit : 1 . The patient receive neoadjuvant systemic treatment : 2 . The patient distant metastatic site first recur surgery : 3 . The patient go receive first-line chemotherapy</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients older 20 year 2 . Patients histologically confirm breast cancer three disease status Patients go receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy feasible biopsy site . Patients recur curative surgery distant metastasis feasible biopsy site . ; Patients must receive adjuvant chemotherapy curative surgery . Patients go firstline palliative chemotherapy feasible biopsy site . 3 . Patients PS ECOG 0 2 4 . Patients willing able comply protocol duration study include undergoing treatment schedule visit examination . 5 . Written inform consent form 6 . Patients must acceptable bone marrow , liver renal function measure within 28 day prior study define : Haemoglobin ≥9.0 g/L ( transfusion allow ) White blood cell ( WBC ) &gt; 3 x 109/L Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 x institutional upper limit normal unless liver metastasis present case must ≤ 5x ULN 1 . Concurrent disease condition would make subject inappropriate study participation serious medical condition would interfere subject 's safety . 2 . Double primary cancer ( except cancer remission &gt; 5 year , cervix cancer situ , basal cell cancer situ , situ cancer resect )</criteria>
