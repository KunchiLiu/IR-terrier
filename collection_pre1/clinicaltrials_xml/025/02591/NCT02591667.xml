	<brief_summary>There paucity data histopathological response peritoneal tumor deposit colorectal cancer neoadjuvant chemotherapy . Particularly , prospective assessment chemotherapy-associated histopathological response within peritoneum perform far . Therefore , urgent need conduct clinical trial aim prospectively assess histopathological response within peritoneum patient peritoneal metastasis colorectal cancer . Recently , Loupakis et al . report triplet regimen 5-fluorouracil , oxaliplatin irinotecan ( FOLFOXIRI ) combination bevacizumab significantly improve median progression-free survival metastatic colorectal cancer patient 9.7 12.1 month compare fluorouracil , leucovorin , irinotecan ( FOLFIRI ) + bevacizumab . In view data , likely FOLFOXIRI + bevacizumab also lead significant improvement histopathological response within peritoneum patient peritoneal metastasis colorectal cancer ( pcCRC ) compare previous standard chemotherapy . The investigator hypothesize FOLFOXIRI + bevacizumab induce pCR major response peritoneal tumor deposit &gt; 30 % patient ( take response rate FOLFOX- FOLFIRI-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy publish literature reference ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Histopathological Response FOLFOXIRI + Bevacizumab Peritoneal Metastasis From Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peritoneal carcinomatosis colorectal cancer ( pcCRC ) dismal prognosis . In era 5-fluorouracil treatment palliative surgery , median survival range 5.2 7.0 month . In patient bowel obstruction due peritoneal carcinomatosis outcome even bad , median overall survival le 4 month 1-year survival rate 17 % . With advent modern chemotherapy regimen , survival improve considerably . However , presence pcCRC still associate significantly bad prognosis compare manifestation metastatic CRC ( e.g . liver and/or lung metastasis ) . A recent retrospective analysis 2095 patient 2 prospective randomize trial show median PFS OS significantly short patient pcCRC compare patient without pcCRC ( PFS : 5.8 vs. 7.2 month , HR=1.2 ; 95 % CI 1.1 1.3 , p=0.001 ; OS : 12.7 vs. 17.6 month , HR=1.3 ; 95 % CI 1.2 1.5 , p &lt; 0.001 ) . The combination cytoreductive surgery ( CRS ) hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy ( HIPEC ) lead remarkable improvement survival select patient pcCRC illustrated prospective randomize trial several retrospective series . The concept CRS + HIPEC therefore recently incorporate national treatment guideline increasingly perform pcCRC patient promise long-term result . The subgroup benefit multimodal therapeutic approach patient limited pcCRC complete removal cancer deposit within peritoneum achieve . There increase evidence addition neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy CRS + HIPEC may improve outcome patient pcCRC . Neoadjuvant chemotherapy , i.e. , chemotherapy give upfront CRS + HIPEC perform , offer several possible advantage patient : First , help identify nonresponders treatment may unsuitable candidate CRS . Second , neoadjuvant chemotherapy may limit extraabdominal systemic spread disease . Third , upfront chemotherapy may help reduce extent peritoneal metastasis , thus facilitate CRS increase likelihood complete surgical cytoreduction . Importantly , recently show efficacy neoadjuvant chemotherapy easily quantify assess chemotherapy-induced histopathological response within peritoneum histopathological response independent predictor survival . In retrospective analysis 115 pcCRC patient underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy follow CRS , patient group three distinct category depend histopathological response neoadjuvant chemotherapy : 1. patient complete pathologic response ( pCR ; remain viable tumor cell peritoneal tumor nodule ) , 2. patient major response ( 1-49 % remain viable tumor cell ) 3. patient minor/no response ( ≥50 % remain viable tumor cell ) . The study able show cumulative 5-year survival rate 75 % patient pCR ( HR=1 ) compare 57 % patient major response ( HR=4.91 ) 13 % patient minor response ( HR=13.46 ) ( p=0.01 ) . Overall , approximately 30 % patient consider responder neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( 9.7 % pCR + 20.2 % major response ) , 70 % patient consider non-responders treatment . Treatment consist FOLFOX- FOLFIRI-based regimen majority patient . The primary objective study prospectively assess histopathological response neoadjuvant chemotherapy FOLFOXIRI + bevacizumab peritoneal tumor deposit 30 patient pcCRC determine percentage viable tumor cell resect specimen neoadjuvant chemotherapy . For patient multiple peritoneal specimen , median percentage viable cell specimen use . Patients 0-49 % viable cell consider responder . The timepoint assessment primary objective re-exploratory surgery/surgical cytoreduction day 78 106 treatment phase study . The investigator hypothesize &gt; 30 % responder neoadjuvant chemotherapy FOLFOXIRI + bevacizumab . Responders define patient pCR ( 0 % viable tumor cell ) major response ( 1-49 % viable tumor cell ) FOLFOXIRI + bevacizumab chemotherapy . Non-responders define patient minor/no response ( ≥50 % viable tumor cell ) FOLFOXIRI + bevacizumab chemotherapy . The following patient also count non-responders : - Patients undergo surgical re-exploration - Patients develop extraabdominal metastasis - Deaths surgical re-exploration</detailed_description>
