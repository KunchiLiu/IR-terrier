	<brief_title>Preventing UTIs Chronic Neurogenic Bladder Dysfunction ( Mix Methods )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Each year UK 1,200 people sustain spinal cord injury , 600 people diagnose cauda equina syndrome , 6,000 multiple sclerosis 300 transverse myelitis . These four patient group suffer neurological disorder spinal cord , result loss normal bladder function know neurogenic bladder dysfunction . This turn lead urinary tract infection ( UTIs ) . UTIs commonly recur debilitate complication , spinal patient experience 2.5 episode per patient per year average . This result 16 % hospital readmission cost care £125 million spent NHS treat UTIs every year , also dramatic impact patient ' quality life . A recent NICE guideline highlight methodological difficulty research prevention UTIs patient neurogenic bladder dysfunction . Given group patient normally feel symptom like 'pain ' ' frequent urge urinate ' , difficult distinguish bladder colonisation ( asymptomatic bacteriuria ) true infection ( symptomatic UTI ) . To date , clear agreement among expert sign symptom indicative symptomatic UTI . Although strong evidence lacking , antibiotic widely use prevention recurrent UTIs patient neurogenic bladder dysfunction . However , approach call question antibiotic resistance become world-wide health concern . In recently publish 'UK Five Year Antimicrobial Resistance Strategy ' , policy maker stress importance research alternative preventative treatment . Bacterial vaccine potentially offer ( cost- ) effective alternative antibiotic therapy UTI management . At least 83 % community-acquired complicate UTIs cause Escherichia coli ( E. coli ) . Uro-Vaxom® ( OM-Pharma , Switzerland ) orally administer , bacterial vaccine consist 6mg lyophilised ( heat-inactivated ) mix E. coli membrane glycoprotein . Previous study show Uro-Vaxom® result significant reduction UTIs otherwise healthy woman recurrent cystitis , well safe use . Before investigate effect promise new vaccine patient neurogenic bladder dysfunction , two crucial issue need clarify . First , consensus must reach measure symptomatic UTI group patient . Second , feasibility carry large , definitive randomise control trial prevention symptomatic UTI patient neurogenic bladder dysfunction must establish . The central aim propose mixed method study clarify two key methodological feasibility issue . In first stage study carry qualitative interview explore patient experience view symptom sign associate UTI . These result , combined finding literature review , enable design quantitative patient survey distribute four service user organisation people neurogenic bladder dysfunction . Finally , take result precede stage , final definition , algorithm , discuss consensus meeting . In second stage study , small-scale parallel , double-blinded , randomised , placebo-controlled , multicentre trial conduct investigate feasibility carry large well-powered study prevention symptomatic UTI patient neurogenic bladder dysfunction . Forty-eight patient randomly assign treatment Uro-Vaxom® , placebo , 3 month followed-up 3 month . This expose pitfall area require re-designing , logistics , recruitment compliance rate , order refine protocol definitive clinical trial .</detailed_description>
