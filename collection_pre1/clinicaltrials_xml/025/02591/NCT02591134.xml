	<detailed_description>The study use parallel randomize design two arm ; participant either randomize non-nutritive sweetener ( NNS ) beverage condition ( active ) water condition ( control ) . A total 432 overweight obese participant ( Body Mass Index ; BMI range : 27-35 kg/m2 ) enrol study . A 3-month weight loss diet phase initially complete , participant receive nutritional advice weekly group session whilst additionally incorporate active control product diet ( week 0-12 ) . This programme base model successfully used American sample ( Peters et al. , 2014 ) adapt UK sample . This follow 9-month weight maintenance phase ( week 13-49 ) participant advise follow general healthy diet accordance dietary guideline ( continue incorporate active control beverage ) attend monthly group session . This follow one year post assist weight maintenance period participant continue consume active control beverage every day ask complete questionnaire measure , cognitive task , biomarkers health ( blood sample , willing ) body composition data ( weight , sagittal diameter hip waist circumference measure ; DXA ( Subset 2 ) ) end period . A subset participant ( Subset 1 ) additionally undergo appetite probe day ( n = 116 ) , attend Study Centre 15 point throughout trial ( 3 session baseline , 3 session start weight loss programme , 3 session end weight loss programme , 3 session end assist weight maintenance 3 session end one year post assist weight maintenance period ) . A separate subset ( Subset 2 ) complete biological assessment measure ( n =50 ) involve body composition ( DXA ) scan 4 point throughout trial ( baseline , end weight loss , end assist weight maintenance , year post assist weight maintenance visit ) participant ask provide blood sample four point exclude trial wish . Both group ask ensure consume least two serving ( 330 ml ) elect beverage dependent condition ( NNS vs. water ) . All beverage pick participant ( permitted range ) deliver bi-weekly batch use online delivery-style system . Primary study visit body weight , waist circumference , hip circumference , sagittal diameter , blood pressure assessment carry various stage throughout trial . Initial assessment baseline ( week -2 ) , monthly weight loss period ( week 4 , 8 12 ) , monthly assist weight maintenance period ( week 16 , 20 , 24 , 28 , 32 , 36 , 40 , 44 48 ) 1 year post assist weight maintenance visit Subset 2 additionally provide body composition ( DXA ) scan baseline , end weight loss period , end assist weight maintenance period 1 year post assist weight maintenance visit . During weight loss phase , participant meet group ( 10-12 participant ) dietician-trained researcher every week ( 12 visit ) follow monthly meeting assist weight maintenance phase ( 9 visit ) . Participants additionally ask complete series questionnaire throughout intervention period complete series diet diary ( 3-day diet diary food frequency questionnaire ; FFQs ) ass compliance throughout trial . Furthermore , empty product packaging ( labels bottle ) collect additional compliance measure .

This programme tailor UK specific behavioural component advice self-monitoring , stimulus control , stress management , slow eat rate relate behaviour cover . An exercise component also include exercise activity note log additional online daily drink log also include . The exercise log complete weekly brought session mean monitoring . Weight measure start end phase weekly WLP part group session ( end group session ) conduct privately participant separate room . Participants also ask complete food frequency questionnaire ( FFQs ) per month online 3-day diet diary begin WLP end WLP give instruction . In week 12 visit ( independent group session ) schedule individually participant complete additional questionnaire cognitive measure ( Visit 13 ) . 36-week assisted weight maintenance phase . Participants ask attend one hour monthly group session dietician-trained researcher ( 10-12 participant per group ) 36-week assisted weight maintenance phase run week 13-48 . These meeting provide opportunity participant discuss concern provide reminder nutritional advice . Body weight measured end group session conduct privately participant separate room . Participants also ask complete series questionnaire measure appetite control ease diet measure dietary compliance alongside provide online daily beverage log weekly paper exercise log . Participants also ask complete FFQs monthly period . At end phase visit ( independent group session ) schedule complete final measure appetite food choice provide final online 3-day diet diary . Fasting blood sample analyse glucose , insulin , lipid , triglyceride , high density lipoprotein ( HDL ) , low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) , total cholesterol profile Hba1 . One year post assist weight maintenance visit After final study visit post-maintenance ( week 48 ) , participant continue provide either NNS water beverages 12-month duration . They ask return empty beverage packaging monthly phase ( week 52 , 56 , 60 , 64 , 68 , 72 , 76 , 80 , 84 , 88 , 92 , 96 ) complete retrospective appetite questionnaire alongside additional questionnaire upon return packaging . They also complete daily online beverage log online duration 12-month period complete final online 3-day food diary present Visit 39 ( week 100 ) . Participants Subset 1 additionally undergo final set probe day week 98-99 ( Visits 38a , 38b , 38c ) . Subset 2 also provide final DXA scan one year post assist weight maintenance period visit ( Visit 39 ) . At final visit participant ask provide fast blood sample well complete range computer task , questionnaire food diary . Their body weight measure waist , hip sagittal diameter take separate room along blood pressure Subsets Subset 1 - Appetite Probe Days A voluntary subset randomly select participant ( n=116 ) invite participate appetite probe day session ass change appetite response caloric non-caloric beverage ( water , NNS caloric beverage ; CB ) . These probe day measure baseline ( Visits 2a , 2b &amp; 2c ; week -2 0 ) , start weight loss programme ( Visits 3a , 3b 3c ; week 1 2 ) , end weight loss period ( Visits 13a , 13b 13c ; week 11 12 ) end assist weight maintenance period ( Visits 24a , 24b , 24c ; week 47 48 ) end 1 year post assist weight maintenance period ( Visits 38a , 38b , &amp; 38c ) . These session schedule minimum 3 day one another ( minimum completion 2 week ) must complete within maximum 3 week . At point one probe day examine response caloric beverage ( ie sugar sweeten beverage ; SSB ) second third response NNS water ( order three drink counterbalance across participant probe day ) . These provide breakfast 1 hour lunch ( approximately 12pm ) . Compensation track ad libitum test lunch even meal . Participants blind study condition ( information provide drink probe day ) however sensory characteristic beverage may evident . Cognitive sensory cue match important determinant real world appetite response . The gold standard 8-hour design use . The appetite probe day conduct Kissileff Laboratory study centre involve participant attend centre fix breakfast ( breakfast calibrate base weight band determine Screening session ; prior end WLP prior end assist weight maintenance phase ensure accurate weight band ) , study beverage , ad libitum lunch ad libitum dinner well take-home snack pack remainder evening . Participants complete appetite VAS pre- post- meal well complete rating hourly interval throughout test day . They free leave Study Centre consume meal provide water well specified time return next meal . Subset 2 - DXA Scans In addition trial participation , Subset 2 ( n = 50 ) ask provide fast full body DXA scan dedicate visit 1d , 14a , 25a , 39 ( week 0 , 12 , 48 one year post assist weight maintenance visit respectively ) . The DXA scan use assess change body composition trial . Participants remind Screening session take part additional testing ( Subsets 1 2 ) provide blood sample eligible enrolment trial .</detailed_description>
