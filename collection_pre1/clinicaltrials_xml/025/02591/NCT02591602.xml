	<brief_summary>Transporting radiology patient 's home challenging . Preliminary experience conduct Turin ( Italy ) Lund ( Sweden ) indicate couple simple , light-weight X-ray equipment Computed radiography Digital Radiography system could effective externalization radiographic service . The image examination quality prove performed stationary equipment analysis safety radio-protection system show low risk exposure health staff well general population . Mobile radiography nursing home show technically feasible beneficial result patient avoid unnecessary transport back forth hospital ; experience majority patient could treat locally . The key point RADHOME project two : 1 . The first one build network model , aim disseminate clinical use domiciliary radiology . 2 . The second one demonstrate clinical efficiency cost-effectiveness domiciliary radiology .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Teleradiology Program Frail Patients Living Home Nursing-homes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Europe currently high proportion old people world expect maintain leading position next 50 year . Population age great challenge public health care system well economic development . As nation age , prevalence disability , frailty , chronic disease expect increase dramatically . The hospital , moment first choice delivery acute medical care , ideal environment frail , elderly patient . New functional impairment iatrogenic event nosocomial infection , pressure sore , fall delirium , common hospital stay . With development medical technology , people complex condition increasingly possibility remain home nursing home rather hospital . Technologies also improve quality life patient informal caregiver , allow people receive care remain active home community , instead institutionalize . These societal change , need health care cost reduction age population , main drive force development telemedicine , especially elderly patient . Residents nurse home patient treat home community care service usually old old , multimorbid often cognitively impaired . For patient transportation hospital X-ray examination may exhaust disorient experience . They collect ambulance taxi take away environment people know . Patients wait hospital corridor fairly simple X-ray do wait pickup . The first objective RADHOME move equipment instead patient order give response geriatric tsunami demand flexible health service , provide view advance economic efficiency service . Teleradiology become essential part practice radiology , broad implication care delivery organization work : combine teleradiology domiciliary X-ray examination potential greatly improve quality care elderly frail patient acute chronic condition . Until wide randomize study radiology home publish . Hence main aim project carefully analyze feasibility , safety cost-effectiveness public , extra-hospital domiciliary radiology service frail elderly immobile patient , vulnerable environmental social change group patient , health condition discourage transportation hospital .</detailed_description>
