	<brief_summary>The purpose randomize intervention pilot evaluate relative efficacy bystander training element ( delivery mode integration substance abuse prevention ) among cohort incoming undergraduate University Kentucky , nationally recognize leader address sexual violence bystander intervention programming . Per university policy , incoming undergraduate participate mandatory online training cover sexual violence awareness , bystander concept , alcohol use/abuse . Consenting student randomize one follow training condition : 1 . Green Dot Intensive Bystander Training ( INT ) 2 . Student Wellness Training ( active control ) .

	<brief_title>A Pilot Bystander Training Programming Sexual Violence Subtance Abuse</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Overview : Incoming student invited participate randomize pilot test bystander program efficacy . Those consent study participation randomize one three condition . All student require take Online sexual violence , bystander alcohol awareness training ( UK mandate HAVEN + Alcohol Edu ) . Those consent study participation randomize one three condition : Green Dot ( INT ) Student Wellness skill training ( active control ) provide UK Student Affairs staff Violence Intervention Prevention Center Student Wellness Office . All student agree study participation invite complete survey baseline ( prior training ) , 2-3 month train 6 month follow training ( late April , early May ) . For pilot , student contact participation November first year , anticipate approximately 1,500 student . Mandatory ( UK ) Online Training : Alcohol abuse violence prevention use bystander approach AlcoholEdu : Confidential substance abuse education course use science-based approach educate student alcohol effect . Whether student drink , course help make informed decision alcohol good deal drink behavior may occur around . AlcoholEdu use 500 college nationwide EVERFi . Haven provide student definition statistic associate sexual assault relationship violence , bystander skill strategy , campus policy resource . The training `` personalized reflective '' incorporate student 's `` unique perspective experience . '' This 45-minute training mandatory student ask complete follow-up survey 45-days training . Because train mandatory incoming student , student expect exposure training . INT Condition ( Randomized ) : Delivered UK 's Violence Intervention Prevention ( see letter Director Henry ) : Green Dot bystander intervention program ( www.livethegreendot.com ) Programming : Seeks empower potential bystander ( student ) actively engage peer violence prevention . Intensive bystander training involve interactive , skill development role-play bystander behavior . This program focus build knowledge skill related interpersonal violence active bystander . There structured curriculum introductory session longer , skill-building session . This currently provide UK classroom , residence hall , etc . Tailored programming provide Greek organization , Living Learning Communities , faculty/staff , etc . While Popular Opinion Leader strategy13 use prior train , trial incoming student randomized condition offer intensive bystander training . Administered : UK VIP Delivery Mode : Class large group 120-150 student ; train last 3-4 hour Required : Elective . All student randomize condition schedule training . NOTE : Green Dot Speeches supplemental Intensive Green Dot Bystander training . Speeches often give plan event ( UK 101 ) student , faculty staff request presentation . These speech continue occur usual . As aim study compare bystander intensive training , attempt limit participation Green Dot Speeches . Training Control Condition ( Randomized ) : Delivered UK 's Student Wellness Office ( Drew M. Smith ) Programming : Addresses element student wellness include campus resource health issue , AOD abuse prevention/harm reduction strategy , time management study tip , stress management reduction , healthy cop strategy . Training may also provide information academic resource , money management , elements healthy adaptation college life . Administered : UK VIP Delivery Mode : Class large group 120-150 student ; train last 3-4 hour Required : Elective . All student randomize condition schedule training . General Statistical Considerations . Continuous variable summarize descriptive statistic ( n , mean , standard deviation , median , first third quartile , min max ) ; categorical variable describe count percentage . Change score percent change score calculate baseline follow-ups 4- 9-months . Numerical graphical summary provide overall , subpopulation within college community ( e.g. , gender , sexual attraction , fraternity/sorority athletic team membership ) importantly train condition . Simple comparison group make use ANOVA continuous variable chi-square test categorical outcome . Comparisons group conduct randomize ; simple comparison continuous variable group perform use ANOVA chi-square test independence categorical variable . Although group randomly assign , potential confounders examine bivariate analysis comparison require covariate adjustment use regression modeling ( e.g . ANCOVA , logistic regression ) . Analysis Plan : The primary purpose pilot determine feasibility examine strategy recruit training student . However , primary analysis randomize comparison cumulative report bystanding behavior collect academic year two training condition . A one-way ANOVA ( correspond post-hoc test compare specific group ) use compare primary outcome bystander behavior ( measure sum frequency response bystander behavior academic year ) randomzied INT versus SubINT condition . Analyses conduct without adjustment , adjust academic year , adjust potential confounders control randomization . Secondary outcome also compare use one-way ANOVA . A two-sided significance level 0.01 use protect Type I error presence multiple comparison . Post-hoc comparison group conduct overall F-test suggest difference group . All analysis primary outcomes conduct use comparison group randomize intent-to-treat ( ITT ) analysis . For lose follow-up , multiple imputation use ITT analysis . Sensitivity analyse use observe data single imputation ( LOCF ) also conduct . We also perform analysis use modify ITT ( mITT ) , participant elect pursue intensive training exclude , group still compare randomize . The primary analysis longitudinal analysis conduct use linear mixed model ( PROC MIXED ) investigate difference condition , trend time , whether time trend differ condition . Longitudinal analysis conduct academic year academic year also combine . For combined academic year , time variable included respect online train academic year investigate potential confounder . Planned subgroup analyse include analysis gender group , sexual attraction , Greek life participation . These also conduct randomize receive . Effect modification also assess include interaction regression model ( linear , logistic , mixed model depend outcome presence longitudinal measure ) . Participation complete non-mandatory training examine overall subgroup well . SAS v9.4 use data management statistical analysis ; significance level 0.01 used statistical test .</detailed_description>
