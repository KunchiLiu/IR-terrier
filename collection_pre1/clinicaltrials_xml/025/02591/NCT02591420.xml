	<brief_title>Safety Virologic Effect Human Monoclonal Antibody ( VRC01 ) Administered Intravenously Adults During Early Acute HIV Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Human monoclonal antibody ( mAbs ) may potential treat HIV infection prevent spread virus . This study evaluate experimental mAB know VRC-HIVMAB060-00-AB ( VRC01 ) . The purpose study evaluate safety virologic effect VRC01 , alone combination ART , adult early acute HIV infection . Researchers also evaluate effect VRC01 establishment HIV reservoir early acute HIV infection . This study enroll participant RV 217 study diagnose early acute HIV infection . Participants randomly assign one three group : Group 1 begin ART receive single infusion placebo Day 0 . Group 2 begin ART receive single infusion VRC01 Day 0 . Group 3 receive single infusion VRC01 Day 0 begin ART Day 7 . ART vary country consist country guideline-recommended first line combination therapy : either efavirenz 600 mg/emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg efavirenz 600 mg/lamivudine 300 mg/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg . This initial ART regimen may adjust switched alternate regimen clinically indicate regimen intolerance failure . Study visit occur Days 0 , 1 , 3 , 7 , 10 , 14 , 18 , 21 , 25 , 28 , 42 , 56 , 84 , 112 , 168 , 175 . Visits include physical examination , medical history review , blood collection . Neurocognitive test take place Day 168 . Some participant may take part optional study procedure various time point study include mucosal secretion collection , rectosigmoid biopsy , lymph node biopsy , leukapheresis , lumbar puncture .</detailed_description>
