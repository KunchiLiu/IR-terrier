	<detailed_description>Project Summary : In study investigator propose evaluate train four ( TOF ) stimulator assess neuromuscular junction patient anesthesia . The goal project evaluate novel device comparison standard care hand hold stimulator . Background Significance : The assessment neuromuscular blockage common practice operating room , agent employ . Still today , use simple hand hold stimulators visual monitoring response norm . The investigator want study potential employ non-invasive quantitative device build sensor hopefully accurately determine degree neuromuscular blockade . This system utilize commonly employ train four ( TOF ) electrical stimulation pulse , incorporate force sensor automate detection system . This system utilized pre-blockade , also throughout entire surgical procedure reversal therapy . For comparison , use prototype device standard hand hold TOF assessment neuromuscular blockage . In word , plan protocol involve test effectiveness accuracy device concurrently peripheral nerve stimulation , procedure do current standard care . All protocol carry direct guidance supervision anesthesiologists and/or nurse anesthetist . The procedure involve apply device suitable anatomic location train four ( TOF ) stimulation/monitoring apply small electrical pulse stimulate patient 's motor point . The location stimulation historically patient forearm ulnar nerve area patient face distribution facial nerve . The stimulation apply area equivalent apply current accepted standard care . All response measure device record electronically compare anesthesiologist's/nurse anesthetist 's interpretation number muscle twitch induce peripheral motor point stimulation . These comparison analyze correlation number muscle twitch degree force generation sense device , aim accurately determine degree patient neuromuscular blockade . This device application monitoring carry anesthetized surgical patient different time point procedure , condition currently utilized peripheral nerve stimulators judge neuromuscular transmission anesthesia effectiveness . We also use system anatomical location may easier gain assess certain surgical procedure : e.g. , bicep , quadriceps , tibialis anterior muscle . Such location describe anesthesiologist viable option . Pre post-surgical care unchanged follow current standard care . The change alongside current peripheral nerve stimulation , non-invasive TOF device also utilized assess relative degree neuromuscular blockage . Currently , clinically available device automate record TOF conduct anesthesiologist staff . Developing method complete assessment expect save anesthesiologist 's time prevent human error increase consistency . This device approach similar muscle force system employ study patient neuromuscular disorder University Minnesota 20 year . Specific Aims/Study Objectives : The investigator hypothesize use advance TOF device automate data storage unique user interface demonstrate enhance efficacy monitoring neuromuscular blockade patient . The investigator continue recruit subject study complete study . Research Design Methods : The study population include female male participant range 18-80 year age . The investigator request total 400 participant study . After investigator collect data individual analyze data determine efficacy test method . If initial population size extremely variable allow investigator conduct proper analysis , request additional subject make conclusion device . Subject identified anesthesiologist prior surgery , consent obtain prior surgical procedure . The information collect medical record include age , height , weight , history muscular disease i.e . myotonia , malignant hyperthermia , previous adverse reaction anesthesia , complete anesthetic record procedure . Data securely store locked Mayo B172 . Data Safety Monitoring Plan : It anticipate use device produce side effect emotional upset . The stopping rule study include unexpected complication use TOF stimulator OR . The patient unconscious sedate monitoring . Statistical Considerations : Historically , FDA clinical trial utilize anywhere 100-400 patient determine relative safety efficacy medical device technology . The obtain data analyzed determine factor could utilize FDA approval monitoring system clinical use . Direct comparison device qualitative evaluation score administer anesthesiologist use final analysis . Data Record Keeping : The data record Dr. Michael Loushin , Dr. Paul Iaizzo , Dr. Jake Hutch , Tinen Iles , data store securely Mayo B172 anesthesiologist . The data store automated TOF manual TOF perform Mayo B172 anesthesiologist . References :</detailed_description>
