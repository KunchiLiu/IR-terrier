	<brief_title>Computerized Cognitive Training Schizophrenia Brazil</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cognitive impairment important determinant functional outcome schizophrenia , inadequately treat antipsychotic medication . Neuroplasticity base computerized cognitive training emerge last two decade attempt help patient cognitive impairment global functioning . The aim study perform computerized cognitive training improve attention , concentration , learning , clinical symptom quality life patient . The investigator interested test differential efficacy specific visual versus auditory computerized cognitive training explore biological marker may involve neuroplasticity base training process . The investigator conduct 40 hour computerize , adaptable , perception specific , cognitive training program patient schizophrenia . Patients come 1 hour , daily , perform visual auditory training , control game 2 month . Visual auditory exercise choose equivalent one another target cognitive domain divide attention , work memory social cognition . Clinical , cognitive , emotional biomarker data collect training , half way , training , assess progress several aspect function biology . The investigator hypothesize visual auditory training effective compare control game . They also expect auditory training efficient compare visual training target sensory function mostly impair schizophrenia , due auditory hallucination patient experience . The investigator also hypothesize training improve clinical symptom quality life . On exploratory analysis , investigator expect identify new biological marker cognitive neuroplasticity , expect differentiate visual auditory path .</detailed_description>
