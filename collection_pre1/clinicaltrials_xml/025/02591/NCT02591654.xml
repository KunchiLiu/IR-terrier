	<brief_summary>The purpose study test two imaging technique , one call whole body ( WB ) diffusion weight ( DWI ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) ( WB-DWI MRI ) , another call Fluorine-18 3'-deoxy-3'-fluorothymidine positron emission tomography ( PET ) ( F-18-FLT PET ) . The goal see whether image technique would allow study doctor see change size tumor earlier patient metastatic melanoma receive Pembrolizumab ( MK-3475 ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MRI PET Assess Pembrolizumab Response</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There grow body evidence demonstrate tumor proliferation , measure classically immunohistochemical evidence increase Ki-67 expression , reliably determine vivo use radiolabeled thymidine . The development [ 18F ] -fluorothymidine ( FLT ) PET reliably identify marker cellular proliferation , show identify change proliferation successfully treat patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically confirm diagnosis melanoma Stage III stage IV metastatic melanoma Disease measurable . This defined lesion measure least 10mm radiologic imaging . For lymph node disease , lesion must measure least 15 mm biopsied show contain melanoma . Skin mucosal lesion measurable radiologic imaging measure least 10mm clinical exam also acceptable . ( See Section 13.2 detailed definition measurable disease ) Disease term unresectable patient refuse resection The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 1 good Age ≥18 year . This due limited data pembrolizumab child young 18 year age . Normal organ marrow function define Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ( SGOT ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) ( SGPT ) ≤2.5 × institutional upper limit normal ( ≤5 x upper limit normal patient liver metastasis ) Total bilirubin within 1.5 x institutional level normal direct bilirubin ≤ upper limit normal ( ULN ) patient total bilirubin level &gt; 1.5 ULN ) Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0g/dL ≥5.6mmol/L Absolute neutrophil count ≥1,000/microliters ( mcL ) Platelets ≥ 75,000/mcL The effect pembrolizumab develop human fetus unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Men treat enrol protocol must also agree use adequate contraception prior study , duration study participation , 4 month completion pembrolizumab administration . Women childbearing potential must negative urinary serum pregnancy test . Prior therapy antiPD1 antibody The patient brain metastasis stable least 4 week . Patient recover Grade 01 adverse event due prior chemotherapy , radiation , biological cancer therapy ( include monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) ) . The patient recover minor major surgery le 4 week major surgery prior start treatment pembrolizumab Significant autoimmune disease require hospitalization within past two year history lifethreatening autoimmune disease Immunosuppressive therapy include systemic corticosteroid except maintenance dose adrenal insufficiency Concurrent use investigational agent Active central nervous system metastasis and/or carcinomatous meningitis causing symptom . Known additional malignancy progress require active treatment exception basal cell carcinoma skin , squamous cell carcinoma skin , situ cervical cancer undergone potentially curative therapy . Active autoimmune disease syndrome require systemic steroid immunosuppressive agent exception replacement dose steroid adrenal insufficiency , vitiligo , resolve childhood asthma/atopy , intermittent use inhaled steroid , local steroid injection , hypothyroidism stable hormone replacement , Sjogren 's syndrome Active tuberculosis Hypersensitivity pembrolizumab excipients . Expected require form systemic antineoplastic therapy receive pembrolizumab Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , autoimmune disease , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement Patients pacemaker , stainless steel aneurysm clip magnetic resonance ( MR ) contraindicate implant foreign body would warrant exclusion study . Pacemakers may reprogrammed turn strong MRI magnetic field . Radiofrequency ( RF ) field MR also cause severe heat pacemaker lead tip . Steel aneurysm clip prone torque strong MR field displace clip may damage vessel , result hemorrhage , and/or death . All patient volunteer screen MR examination use MRI safety screen Questionnaire part New York Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center ( NYP/CUMC ) MRI safety policy . Any patient would normally exclude screening process would also exclude study . Pregnant breastfeed woman exclude study unknown effect study agent unborn child possible adverse impact immune activation pregnancy . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother pembrolizumab breastfeed discontinue mother treated pembrolizumab . Male expect father child treatment period . History pneumonitis require hospitalization systemic immune suppressive therapy . Significant immunodeficiency make patient unlikely benefit pembrolizumab therapy include diagnosis acquire immune deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) , active hepatitis B hepatitis C , organ transplant require immunosuppressive therapy . Received live virus vaccine within 30 day plan start therapy</criteria>
