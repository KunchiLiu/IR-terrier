	<brief_title>Study Combined Effect Low Level Laser Therapy Manual Lymph Drainage Reducing Body Circumference</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The American Society Plastic Surgeons ( ASPS ) 2011 report state market cosmetic procedure show significant growth past two year , 13.8 million cosmetic plastic surgery procedure perform United States 2011 , 5 % since 2010 . While surgical cosmetic procedure significantly increase 2010 2011 , overall growth cosmetic procedure primarily drive substantial rise minimally-invasive procedure increase 6 % , nearly 12.2 million cosmetic minimally-invasive procedure perform 2011 . This highlight grow consumer demand non- minimally-invasive cosmetic procedure involve surgical procedure liposuction associate risk , potential complication lengthy painful recovery process . Low level laser light therapy ( LLLT ) offer simple , non-invasive , safe , effective side-effect free alternative achieve body circumference reduction . Erchonia low level laser , include Erchonia® Verju™ Laser , determine safe effective FDA application body circumference reduction indication multiple body area . The Iskra Medical Green PRESS 8 manual lymph drainage system also simple , non-invasive , safe side-effect free alternative achieve body circumference reduction demonstrate optimal effectiveness use combination establish alternative non-invasive mean body circumference reduction LLLT application . LLLT , apply Erchonia® Verju™ Laser , effect transitory pore adipocyte cell membrane enable fat pas intracellular space extra-cellular space . The Green PRESS 8 operate accord principle manual lymph drainage , employ pump air control pressure inflatable cuff accord pre-set pressure , compression pause duration therapy time parameter . The alternate release compression different vascular lymphatic structure effect enhances lymphatic drainage result influx blood along nourishing element , elimination fluid metabolic waste product . When used combination LLLT , process enhances accelerate process reduction size adipocyte cell increase liquefaction emulsification fat transitory pore adipocyte cell , initiate precede application LLLT . The purpose study evaluate green diode LLLT apply Erchonia® Verju™ Laser effective reduce circumference hip , waist upper abdomen use combination Green PRESS 8 manual lymph drainage system twice weekly six week use alone .</detailed_description>
