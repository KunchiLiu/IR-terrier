	<brief_title>Reappraisal GIK Acute STEMI Pre-hospital Administration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background - After acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) , early successful myocardial reperfusion primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) effective strategy reduce infarct size improve clinical outcome . The process restore blood flow ischemic myocardium , however , induce injury per se , paradoxically increase extent final infarction ( i.e. , reperfusion injury ) . Research focus year strategy effectively counteract reperfusion injury , thereby , reduce final infarct size salutary effect clinical outcome . Robust experimental evidence support Glucose-Insulin-Potassium ( GIK ) effective cardioprotective agent capable metabolically protect myocardium ischemia ischemia/reperfusion injury . These benefit clearly related time GIK administer course cardiac ischemia , effectiveness increase early administration . However , clinical trial reperfusion era lose opportunity translate beneficial effect see laboratory clinical setting , unacceptably prolong delay onset ischemic symptom GIK administration . A properly-designed prospective trial double-blinded randomization placebo GIK out-of-hospital setting would straightforwardly overcome limitation , thereby provide convince evidence favor disfavor GIK treatment . Notable , GIK un-expensive compound , upon verification efficacy , GIK treatment would ready primetime clinical application matchless cost/effectiveness profile . Aims 1. ass whether pre-hospital GIK administration acute STEMI patient would reduce infarct size ischemia/reperfusion damage use comprehensive tissue characterization cardiovascular magnetic resonance ( CMR ) early post-infarction phase . 2. explore putative cardioprotective mechanism pre-hospital GIK administration Methods - The investigator conduct single-center randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blinded trial test efficacy pre-hospital GIK administration patient acutely reperfused STEMI . The pre-specified primary end-point reduction infarct size , quantitated late gadolinium enhancement CMR early post-infarction phase . Major secondary end-points : 1 ) reduction ischemia/reperfusion injury quantitated CMR , 2 ) investigation putative cardioprotective mechanism ofGIK treatment subject acute STEMI . Outlook : The investigator study result , positive , persuade scientific community reconsider pre-hospital GIK treatment adjunctive primary PCI acute STEMI patient revitalize field metabolism-based cardioprotection . They illustrate mechanism cardioprotection achieve clinical setting , prompt large prospective multicentre trial test efficacy pre-hospital GIK administration hard clinical end-points .</detailed_description>
