	<brief_summary>The investigator propose randomize non-blinded comparison standard vs. transcorporal approach placement artificial urinary sphincter male patient stress urinary incontinence radiation radical prostatectomy prostate cancer . In United States , artificial urinary sphincter ( AUS ) , manufacture American Medical Systems , gold standard surgical treatment stress urinary incontinence ( SUI ) men . The cuff , portion device encircles occludes urethra , typically place directly around urethra ( i.e. , `` standard '' placement ) . The cuff erode urethra . Transcorporal placement introduce method reduce risk erosion . Transcorporal placement involve tunnel cuff erectile body protect dorsal aspect urethra . This approach never compare standard placement randomize fashion . In randomized trial , additional procedure beyond normal care protocol require patient . The investigator conduct study establish , IRB-approved multi-institutional network surgeon . Success assess via objective subjective method ; complication tally standardized fashion . Outcomes measured two year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Procedure/ Methods : Patients identify urology clinic upon standard care visit AUS placement . The procedure determine whether patient surgical candidate follow : - Incontinence Impact Questionnaire Short Form ( IIQ-7 ) Urinary Incontinence Symptoms index ( ISI ) standardize questionnaire - Physical examination - Review medical history would preclude surgery - Cystoscopy evaluate rule stricture - Uroflow/Post void residual ensure adequate bladder capacity Pre surgery work include : - Urine analysis indicate urine culture treatment urinary tract infection - Flow , post-void residual possible - Cystoscopy rule bladder neck contracture urethral stricture - History physical examination - Treatment men 2 day chlorhexidine wash perineum - Incontinence sexual function questionaires - Aminogllycoside abx prior surgery - 24 hour pad weight Post-surgery follow : - Routine removal catheter within 5 day post-op - Treatment antibiotic post-operatively limit 1 week - Activation AUS 4-8 week post-op - Incontinence sexual function questionnaires - 24 hour pad weight Routine follow ups conduct 2 week , 6 week , 3 month , 6 month post-operatively , yearly thereafter ( SOC ) . Patient characteristic collect include : - etiology incontinence . - pre-operative pad usage - prior anti-incontinence procedure - adjuvant therapy prostate cancer radiotherapy , history pelvic radiation - post-operative urodynamic study - cystoscopy finding</detailed_description>
