	<brief_summary>This multicenter randomize phase II determine administration standard platinum-based chemotherapy MK-3475 Chemotherapy naive stage IV Non-small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) improve overall response rate ( ORR ) compare MK-3475 administered chemotherapy . Patients give Pembrolizumab maintenance 1 year : Carboplatin paclitaxel pemetrexed every 3 week x 4 cycle follow pembrolizumab every 3 week 1 year . Pembrolizumab every 3 week x 4 cycle follow carboplatin paclitaxel pemetrexed every 3 week x 4 cycle follow pembrolizumab every 3 week 1 year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optimal Sequencing Pembrolizumab ( MK-3475 ) Standard Platinum-based Chemotherapy First-Line NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While genotype-directed strategy establish effective treatment selection patient advance NSCLC , minority patient time readily identifiable actionable molecular target . Furthermore , genotype-directed therapy validate patient squamous cell carcinoma lung . Therefore , majority patient advance NSCLC continue rely standard platinum-based doublet chemotherapy . Given plateau effectiveness approach , novel treatment strategy clearly warrant .</detailed_description>
