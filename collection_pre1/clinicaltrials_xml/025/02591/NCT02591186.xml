Research Design Methods This prospective , randomize , control study . Participants woman Principal Investigator 's practice seek IVF . Participants randomize 1:1 either acupuncture group standard care ( acupuncture ) group . Each group 3 study visit . Rationale Control Group : A sham control group use systematic review suggest sham acupuncture control may unnecessarily complicate RCT evidence base give nature objective outcome IVF study ( http : //www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3124624/ ) . Power analysis With 35 patient allocate group , assume Student 's T-test use determine difference two independent sample , effect size &gt; 0.6 find statistically significant alpha .05 power .80 . In practical term , since PSS validation sample show mean 13.5 variance=6.2 , average difference great 1.5 raw score point PSS find statistically significant . The investigator plan seek extramural funding future . The investigator use data obtain pilot study perform power analysis calculate number participant need future proposal .</detailed_description>
