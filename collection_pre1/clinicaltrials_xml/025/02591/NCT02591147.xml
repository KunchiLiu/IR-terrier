	<brief_summary>This pilot trial randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial two parallel arm : intervention group use silver diamine fluoride ( SDF ) placebo group ( control ) . 144 eligible healthy adult enrol study randomly assign one two treatment group . Both group receive traditional preventive measure include cleaning , Fluoride varnish , diet analysis counseling . Study participant follow two year caries progression radiographically monitor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Silver Diamine Fluoride Pilot Study ( SDF )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot study compare 1 ) Silver diamine fluoride ( SDF ) fluoride varnish 2 ) Placebo fluoride varnish ( conventional prevention ) management early approximal carious lesion . Early approximal carious lesion refers decay teeth , diagnose radiograph , extend 1/3 way dentin . Management early approximal carious lesion refers halt lesion progression , encourage lesion reversal early carious lesion detect . SDF provide novel , low-cost intervention option manage early carious lesion could potentially bridge 'gap ' non-operative operative option ; thus , postpone first placement restoration . SDF use arrest carious lesion 100 year . However , SDF never test arrest approximal caries lesion permanent teeth . SDF act prevent arrest tooth decay multiple way : 1 ) act body carious lesion precipitate silver ion lesion , thus block diffusion pathway cariogenic acid ; 2 ) interacts dental enamel lead formation fluoroapatite crystal make tooth surface acid resistant ; 3 ) precipitate silver SDF act bactericidal agent disturb formation cariogenic biofilm .</detailed_description>
