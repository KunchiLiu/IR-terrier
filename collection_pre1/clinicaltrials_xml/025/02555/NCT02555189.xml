	<brief_summary>This partially randomized phase IB/II trial study side effect best dose ribociclib give enzalutamide see well work compare enzalutamide alone treat patient prostate cancer respond treatment hormone ( hormone resistant ) , spread primary site ( place start ) place body ( metastatic ) , chemotherapy naïve , retain retinoblastoma expression . Testosterone cause growth prostate cancer cell . Hormone therapy use enzalutamide may fight prostate cancer block use testosterone tumor cell . Ribociclib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . It yet know whether enzalutamide work well give without ribociclib treat patient prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Enzalutamide With Without Ribociclib Metastatic , Castrate-Resistant , Chemotherapy-Naive Prostate Cancer That Retains RB Expression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ribociclib combination 160 mg enzalutamide . ( Phase Ib ) II . To determine efficacy respect proportion subject achieve &gt; = 50 % reduction prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) 12 week . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I. PSA progression-free survival . II . Radiographic progression-free survival . III . Safety . IV . Pharmacokinetics . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate expression retinoblastoma ( RB ) circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) tumor tissue . II . To evaluate mechanism castrate resistance ( androgen receptor [ AR ] -variant [ v ] 7 ) tumor tissue CTCs . III . To explore resistance mechanism cyclin dependent kinase ( CDK ) 4/6 inhibitor tumor sample patient progress enzalutamide ribociclib . IV . Explore use/correlation circulate deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) /exosomes castrate-resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) patient treat enzalutamide without ribociclib . V. Androgen profile correlation clinical outcome . VI . Development model explant system correlate clinical outcome . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study ribociclib follow phase II study . PHASE Ib : Patients receive enzalutamide orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 ribociclib PO QD day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PHASE II : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM A : Patients receive enzalutamide PO QD day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM B : Patients receive enzalutamide PO QD day 1-28 ribociclib PO QD day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 24 month .</detailed_description>
