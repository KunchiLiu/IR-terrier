	<brief_title>Gene Expression Profile Inflammation Profile Classic Asthma , Cough Variant Asthma Eosinophilic Bronchitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Asthma common heterogeneous respiratory disorder affect million people , pose considerable burden health care system globally . The disease characterize inflammation airway eosinophils , neutrophil , mast cell , lymphocyte , airway epithelial cell , smooth muscle cell cell , airflow obstruction bronchial hyperresponsiveness . The disease trigger multiple gene-environment interaction . Asthma heterogeneity recognize term clinical phenotype asthma whereby classic asthma ( CA ) cough variant asthma ( CVA ) identify . classic asthma common phenotype asthma present episodic dyspnoea wheeze without cough . Cough variant asthma phenotype asthma present solely cause chronic cough . Eosinophilic bronchitis ( EB ) common cause chronic cough , like eosinophil asthma characterize airway eosinophilic inflammation , unlike asthma airway hyperresponsiveness variable airflow obstruction . Improvement disease diagnosis management require good understanding disease heterogeneity . A useful biomarker phenotype recognition represent underlie pathologic mechanism disease , mark heterogeneity guide personalize treatment approach . Our hypothesis different clinical manifesto patient eosinophilic bronchitis , classic asthma , cough-variant asthma could cause differential gene expression profile peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) differential inflammation profile aspect .</detailed_description>
