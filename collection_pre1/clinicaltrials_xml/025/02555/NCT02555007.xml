	<brief_summary>Background : Metronomic oral Vinorelbine efficacy metastatic NSCLC malignant Pleural Mesothelioma , study publish thus far base upon variety empirical possibly suboptimal schedule , inconsistent result . Mathematical modeling show simulation new metronomic protocol could lead good safety efficacy profile . Design : This phase Ia/Ib trial design confirm safety ( phase Ia ) evaluate efficacy ( phase Ib ) new metronomic oral vinorelbine schedule . Patient metastatic NSCLC malignant Pleural Mesothelioma , failure standard treatment , ECOG 0-2 adequate organ function , eligible . Our mathematical PK-PD model suggest alternative weekly D1 , D2 D4 innovative schedule ( name Vinorelbine Theoretical Protocol ) dynamic intake 60 , 30 60 mg , respectively . Trial recruitment two-staged 12 patient planned participate phase Ia , confirm safety consolidate calibration average parameter model . Depending phase Ia result , favorable decision consultative committee , extension phase ( phase Ib ) efficacy study include number 20 patient receive Optimal Vinorelbine Theoretical Protocol . The primary endpoint tolerance ( assessed CTC v4.0 ) phase Ia objective response accord RECIST 1.1 phase Ib . An ancillary study circulate angiogenesis biomarkers subproject trial . Discussion : ongoing trial first prospectively test mathematical optimize schedule metronomic chemotherapy . As , trial consider proof-of-concept study demonstrate feasibility run computational-driven protocol ensure optimal efficacy/toxicity balance patient cancer .</brief_summary>
