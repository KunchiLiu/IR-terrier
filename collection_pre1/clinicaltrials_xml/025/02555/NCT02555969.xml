	<brief_summary>This protocol ass patient AL amyloidosis achieve complete response ( CR ) good partial response ( VGPR ) therapy minimal residual disease ( MRD ) . Three approach MRD test use since establish method . The investigator clone sequence patient 's light chain ( LC ) gene design patient-specific primer evaluate genomic DNA future marrow specimen . Whole genome sequencing ( WGS ) use test baseline follow-up marrow cell DNA , seek copy number variation chromosomes 1 2 22 , structural variation chromosomes 11 14 , consistent know genetic abnormality AL clonal LC gene use . Plasma protein analysis mass spectrometry also use look fragmentary protein sequence associate culprit LC gene subject . The feasibility predictive value three approach patient achieve CR VGPR evaluate . This protocol help provide insight way disease change progress . MRD test likely important next step AL management .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This protocol ass AL amyloidosis patient achieve CR VGPR first-line therapy evidence MRD Q-PCR , NGS , plasma protein analysis mass spectrometry use marrow cell obtain annually time standard clinical evaluation . A bone marrow aspirate sample diagnosis use create baseline profile patient 's disease . This sample allow investigator create primer-probe set require MRD test Q-PCR , conduct patient achieve CR VGPR . A baseline bone marrow biopsy sample either take time consent take storage patient previously consent marrow cell bank research purpose . An extra 15 mL aspirate take diagnostic bone marrow biopsy , routinely conduct newly diagnose patient clinical purpose . Annual bone marrow aspirate take research purpose patient respond . Patients remain protocol , begin MRD test achieve CR VGPR first-line therapy point annual marrow collection MRD test begin . In event patient reach CR VGPR first-line therapy , baseline bone marrow aspirate diagnosis discard . Patients choose allow marrow use study sign consent form specifically study . At time consent , three green top tube peripheral blood obtain WGS non-tumor cell . No blood sample require study . After achieve CR VGPR , patient completely re-staged standard care annual interval . Samples test presence MRD marrows obtain time clinical re-staging 3 year response therapy . Both blood bone marrow sample study immediately take on-site laboratory briefly store test . This ensure study sample interfere routine clinical care . In order test presence MRD , three technique use : Q-PCR , WGS , plasma protein analysis mass spectrometry . Both Q-PCR WGS use genomic DNA marrow aspirate sample . To make primer-probe set Q-PCR , bone marrow sample baseline use create individualized primer-probe set recognize genetically unique LC gene cause patient 's disease . To perform WGS , genomic DNA supply core genetics laboratory creation library multiplex next generation sequence . To perform plasma protein analysis , plasma isolated portion subject 's peripheral blood bone marrow aspirate sample on-site laboratory . Each subject 's de-identified LC gene sequence de-identified plasma sample send Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center ( MSKCC ) mass spectrometry look fragmentary protein sequence associate culprit LC gene subject . After reach CR VGPR , annual evaluation 3 year , genomic DNA research sample bone marrow collect standard care clinical procedure use confirm maintenance response test presence MRD 3 method ( Q-PCR , WGS , plasma protein analysis ) note . Marrow material collect purpose study store analysis , primer-probe set design conduct entirely within Tufts Medical Center . Any marrow sample fully consume analysis destroy . By use three method protocol determine whether one method superior others whether three method produce result correlate . The decision discontinue participation MRD test make patient physician individual basis . Patients relapse hematologic progression disease three year period standard blood urine test longer test MRD .</detailed_description>
