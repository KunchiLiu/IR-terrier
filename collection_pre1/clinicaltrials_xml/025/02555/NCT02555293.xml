	<brief_summary>Surgery almost case potentially curative treatment option patient primary secondary malignancy liver . However , case oncological resection ( `` R0-resections '' ) achieve perform major liver resection ( 4 liver segment ) , relate considerable postoperative complication systemic infection postoperative liver insufficiency ( postresectional liver failure ( PRLF ) ) . Despite optimized preoperative postoperative strategy care presently , 32-55 % patient display severs postoperative complication ( Clavien score ≥ 3a ) 5 % even suffer severe PRLF . Recent observation murine disease model well human patient suggest postoperative alteration hemodynamics within portal vein tract well postoperative modulation immune response facilitates translocation gut bacteria blood , lead systemic infection sepsis . Moreover become apparent inflammatory mediator , release gut microbiota might negatively affect postoperative liver regeneration . Rifaximin ( Xifaxan® ) novel potent , semisynthetic antibiotic efficiently act enteric bacteria significantly reduce liver inflammation liver fibrosis animal study . Moreover , Rifaximin well tolerate , even patient liver insufficiency .</brief_summary>
