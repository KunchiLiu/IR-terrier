	<brief_summary>Primary objective study evaluate whether patient severe eosinophilic asthma receive long-term treatment mepolizumab ( least 3 year ) need maintain treatment mepolizumab continue receive benefit . Subjects participate open-label study MEA115666 201312 least 6 month treatment mepolizumab prior Visit 1 2 consecutive miss dos mepolizumab treatment eligible participate study . This study conduct 4 part approximately 300 subject . Part A Variable Open-Label Run-in ( subject less 3 year mepolizumab treatment ) . Once require 3 year exposure reach , subject enter Part B- Fixed Open-Label Run-In ( 4 week 8 week ) . During Part A B subject administer Open-label mepolizumab ( 100 milligram [ mg ] Subcutaneous [ SC ] ) every 4 week . Part C randomize double-blinded part . Upon completion Part B , eligible subject randomize mepolizumab ( 100 mg SC ) every 4 week placebo administer SC every 4 week 52 week . Subjects discontinue investigational product ( IP ) due clinically significant asthma exacerbation enter optional Part D study . During Part D , subject receive open-label mepolizumab addition standard care therapy remainder study , Part D 52-weeks post-randomization . An Exit Visit conduct 52 week randomization order ass subject 's efficacy parameter , immunogenicity status , conduct additional safety assessment . Eligible subject participate study range 56 to192 week , depend duration Part A ( 0 132 week ) Part B ( 4 8 week ) .</brief_summary>
