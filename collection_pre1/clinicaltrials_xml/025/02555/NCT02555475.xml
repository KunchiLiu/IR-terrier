	<brief_title>The Prime Study - Comparing Hepatitis C Care Treatment Primary Health Care Service With Tertiary Hospital</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open label randomise trial investigate efficacy treat people G1 HCV DAA primary healthcare service compare tertiary hospital clinic . Three hundred eighty G1 HCV infect patient attend study primary healthcare centre invite participate study . At primary healthcare centre participant randomly allocate two group : Group 1 : ( n=190 ) Following initial screen , participant refer tertiary hospital transient elastography DAA treatment ( traditional model care ) Group 2 : ( n=190 ) Following initial screen , participant offer transient elastography DAA treatment deliver primary healthcare service . Treatment consist fix dose combination paritaprevir , ombitasvir ritonavir package together dasabuvir , know Viekira Pak , +/- weight base ribavirin . As cirrhotic patient exclude study , duration treatment 12 week .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Aged ≥18 year ; Attendance study PHCS define ; Attended appointment PHCS least 2014 ; Attended least one consultation study community hepatitis nurse 20122014 Evidence chronic G1 HCV infection ( HCV antibody positive &gt; 6 month HCV RNA positive ) ; Absence cirrhosis define one following : Liver biopsy within 24 month prior screen demonstrate absence cirrhosis ( e.g . Metavir score 3 less Ishak score 4 less ) ; A screening FibroScan result &lt; 9.6 kPa ; FibroScan unsuccessful A screen Aspartate Aminotransferase Platelet Ratio Index ( APRI ) ≤ 2 clinical laboratory evidence cirrhosis ; HCV treatment naive pegylated standard interferon ribavirin experience ; Willing able provide write informed consent Subjects must follow laboratory parameter screen : ALT ≤ 10 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) ; AST ≤ 10 time ULN Haemoglobin ≥ 12g/dL male ; ≥ 11g/dL female subject ; Platelet count ≥ laboratory lower limit normal ; INR ≤ laboratory upper limit normal , unless stable anticoagulant regimen affect INR ; Albumin ≥ laboratory lower limit normal ; Direct bilirubin ≤ laboratory upper limit normal ; Creatinine clearance ( Clcr ) ≥ 60mL/min calculated CockcroftGault equation . Known cirrhosis define : Liver biopsy within 24 month prior screen demonstrate cirrhosis ( e.g . Metavir score &gt; 3 Ishak score &gt; 4 ) ; A FibroScan result &gt; 12.5 kPa ; Prior clinical evidence cirrhosis portal hypertension ( i.e . ascites , varix ) . Prior exposure HCV DAA protease inhibitor Currently receive HCV treatment ; Testing positive HIV ; Testing positive HBsAg ; HCC ; Pregnancy breastfeed screen baseline ; Evidence condition , therapy , laboratory abnormality circumstance ( current prior ) may confound study 's result , interfere participation full duration study , best interest participant ; Use concomitant medication contraindicate Viekira Pak within 28 day baseline/day 1 visit , unable ceased duration treatment . Additional exclusion criterion participant receive ribavirin : increase baseline risk anaemia ( i.e . history thalassaemia , spherocytosis , history GI bleeding ) ; patient anaemia would medically problematic ; document presume coronary artery disease cerebrovascular disease , judgement investigator , acute decrease haemoglobin 4 g/dL ( may see ribavirin ) would well tolerate .</criteria>
