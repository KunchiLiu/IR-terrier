	<brief_summary>A randomize control endoscopist-blinded study compare efficacy liquid simethicone ( 100mg ) 5 mls water , versus placebo ( 5mls water ) , premedication ( give least 30 minute ) gastroscopy towards improvement total mucosal visibility score .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Small Volume Simethicone Before Gastroscopy : Any Benefit ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Excessive bubble foam gastroscopy common problem cause significant hindrance optimal evaluation gastric mucosa , prolong procedure time , contribute poor patient tolerance scope . Simethicone , without N-acetylcysteine , extensively evaluate improve mucosal visibility . However , volume simethicone preparation time ingest solution gastroscope vary significantly across different study . In general , appear large volume simethicone solution , give earlier gastroscopy , may yield good result . However , allow patient ingest large volume liquid gastroscopy sedation bring forth risk aspiration . A recent Taiwanese study publish 2014 [ 1 ] show subgroup 100mg simethicone 5ml water , achieve good total mucosal visibility score , solution ingest 30 minute gastroscope . This may long time allow simethicone coat mucosa . However , study compare preparation placebo . In Changi General Hospital , many gastroscopy do daily premedication . Also , protocol premedication gastroscope . This study hop prove low volume simethicone solution , give ample time ( 30 minute ) scope , significantly improve overall endoscopy performance compare premedication .</detailed_description>
