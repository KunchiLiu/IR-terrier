	<brief_title>Phase 2 Study TAK-850 Comparison With Influenza Hemagglutinin ( HA ) Vaccine Healthy Adult Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study phase 2 , single dose study TAK-850 ( cell-culture derive TIV ) administer subcutaneously healthy Japanese adult , design randomize , double-blind , parallel-group , comparative study evaluate immunogenicity safety compare egg-derived TIV . The drug test study call TAK-850 . TAK-850 test healthy volunteer . This study look immunogenicity safety TAK-850 ( cell-derived ) compare egg-derived influenza vaccine . The study enrol 400 patient . Participants randomly assign ( chance , like flip coin ) one two groups—which remain undisclosed patient study doctor study ( unless urgent medical need ) : - TAK-850 - Influenza HA vaccine All participant receive one injection . This single center trial conduct Japan . The overall time participate study 22 day .
