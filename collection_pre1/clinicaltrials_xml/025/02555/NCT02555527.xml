	<brief_title>Contrast Echocardiography Cost Effectiveness Left Ventricular Thrombus Assessment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Decision analysis technique utilized construct estimate model diagnosis , treatment , outcomes cost among patient dilate ischemic cardiomyopathy refer clinically indicate rest transthoracic echocardiography . We first perform systematic review literature regard use contrast echocardiography detection LV thrombus , order ensure model design accurately reflect clinical practice current outcome . Patients begin model state dilate ischemic cardiomyopathy possible LV thrombus , progress model 's various health state base event probability influence whether patient receive contrast initial echocardiogram . The probability event occur ( e.g. , stroke , bleed complication , death ) estimate use data literature DEDUCE database . The cost inpatient , outpatient , extend care health state derive available source , include Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data , National Nursing Home Survey data , publish literature . Appropriate statistical method , include inverse probability weight partitioned estimator , use correctly impute long-term resource utilization , give data include patient censor due loss follow-up . Quality life adjustment factor health state draw literature . For temporary event state bleed , utility decrement subtract baseline utility value . The model long-term horizon , model outcome include long-term cost well QALYs . There number scenario analyse evaluate alternative modeling assumption . For example , simulate selective use contrast patient technically inadequate study versus routine use contrast primary analysis . We also evaluate cost-effectiveness alternative perspective ( U.S. health care system ; provider ; payer ) , various reimbursement scheme interest ( e.g. , fee-for-service ; accountable care organization set ) assume short term time horizon ( e.g. , index episode care 90 day test ; three year horizon ) . We also test model 's robustness series sensitivity analyse . These include univariate ( one-way ) sensitivity analyse assess model 's robustness alternative value input parameter individually . Examples parameter sensitivity analyse conduct include cost , thrombus incidence , event rate . In addition univariate sensitivity analysis , also perform probabilistic ( many-way ) sensitivity analysis use Monte Carlo method assess model 's global stability . Cost-effectiveness acceptability frontier generate illustrate model sensitivity . All modeling perform manner consistent current International Society Pharmacoeconomics Outcomes Research Good Research Practices guidance . In order incorporate variability willingness-to-pay threshold United States payer , report result across range cost-effectiveness threshold $ 50,000 - $ 200,000 per QALY , $ 100,000 per QALY pre-specified primary threshold .</detailed_description>
