	<brief_summary>The overall objective present study describe occurrence Potentially Inappropriate Prescribing ( PIP ) Ontario 's elderly ( &gt; 65 yr ) population , assess health economic burden associate , evaluate intervention aim mitigating effect . To attain objective , investigator test three specific hypothesis : Hypothesis 1 : Instances Potentially Inappropriate Prescribing frequent costly . To test hypothesis , investigator apply subset STOPP criterion Beers criterion Ontario health administrative data identify instance potentially inappropriate prescribing , estimate potential saving , direct indirect , could achieve reduce inappropriate prescribing . Hypothesis 2 : ED visit hospitalization significantly associate Potentially Inappropriate Prescribing . To test hypothesis , investigator estimate attributable fraction ER visit hospitalization associate different frequency PIP use multivariate method survival analysis . Hypothesis 3 : The likelihood inappropriate prescribing associate patient physician characteristic . To test hypothesis , investigator identify physician 's annual PIP incidence density , calculate divide number PIP issue total number prescription provide study period explore association patient physician level covariates patient outcomes . The investigator test hypothesis framework retrospective cohort study investigator conduct use Ontario 's large health administrative population database . These house Institute Clinical Evaluative Sciences ( ICES ) contain information hospital outpatient use health service , well demographic socioeconomic data . Patients include study OHIP ( Ontario Health Insurance Plan ) eligible patient age 66 yrs age old issue least one prescription April 1st 2003 March 31st 2013 . The investigator team , house ICES @ uOttawa , extensive experience expertise analysis database , support resource necessary successfully carry study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : The overall objective study describe occurrence Potentially Inappropriate Prescribing ( PIP ) Ontario 's elderly ( &gt; 65 year ) population , assess health economic burden associate , evaluate intervention aim mitigating effect . Hypothesis 1 : Instances Potentially Inappropriate Prescribing frequent costly . To test hypothesis , investigator apply subset STOPP criterion Beers criterion Ontario health administrative data identify instance potentially inappropriate prescribing , estimate potential saving , direct indirect , could achieve reduce inappropriate prescribing . Hypothesis 2 : ED visit hospitalization significantly associate Potentially Inappropriate Prescribing To test hypothesis , investigator estimate attributable fraction ER visit hospitalization associate different frequency PIP use multivariate method survival analysis . Hypothesis 3 : The likelihood inappropriate prescribing associate patient physician characteristic . To test hypothesis , investigator identify physician 's annual PIP incidence density , calculate divide number PIP issue total number prescription provide study period explore association patient physician level covariates patient outcome . Background : Adverse drug event common elderly , contribute significantly emergency room ( ER ) visit unplanned hospitalization . Patients age sixty-five currently represent 14 % Canadian population , yet spend prescription medication senior account 40 % retail prescription drug sale . This equivalent per caput spending prescription drug senior three time Canadian average . A recent Irish study show , 600 elderly patient admit hospital acute illness , 25 % one adverse drug event , two third contribute hospitalization . Of adverse event contribute hospitalization , 69 % deem avoidable . A number tools strategy develop identify potentially inappropriate prescribing ( PIP ) , however , recently , none commonly use tool show reliably predict adverse event . The STOPP/START criterion ( Screening Tool Older Persons ' potentially inappropriate Prescriptions / Screening Tool Alert doctor Right Treatment ) recently compare long-standing Beers criterion , find detect adverse drug effect causal contribute hospitalization elderly patient acute illness 2.8 time often Beers criterion . The application criterion usually do clinical context , involve time-intensive expensive chart review . There relatively study look appropriateness prescribe population level , use health administrative data . Applying tool assess appropriateness prescribing , subset STOPP criterion , health administrative data provide unique opportunity ass frequency potentially inappropriate prescribing associate cost , term medication health service use population level . Methods : To achieve aim , investigator conduct retrospective cohort study use Ontario 's large health administrative population database , contain information hospital outpatient use health service , well demographic socioeconomic data . This study conduct use Ontario administrative health database house Institute Clinical Evaluative Sciences ( ICES ) , access ICES @ uOttawa site . Benefits work : By use health administrative data Institute Clinical Evaluative Sciences ( ICES ) expect identify factor , patient prescriber level , associate poor prescribing , show measure already place practice setting effective improve quality prescribing , also reduce adverse outcome associate poor prescribing . This evidence provide basis target policy measure aim improve prescribe quality outcome Ontario senior , reduce cost .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1 . Individuals eligible participation study include patient : continuously eligible OHIP ( Ontario Health Insurance Plan ) coverage , issue least one prescription ( type ) accrual period ( April 1st , 2003 March 31st , 2013 ) , 66 year age old date first dispensation accrual period ; necessary ensure availability one year background information medication health service use patient . 1 . Patients exclude : They valid OHIP number . This include individual whose health care provide plan ( e.g . First Nations people live reserve , member Canadian Armed Forces , refugee claimant ) therefore capture ICES data . Patients also exclude OHIPeligible least one year prior index date , one year index date , continuous OHIP coverage two date ; necessary ensure predictor outcomes PIP adequately capture . Patients dispensed prescription medication include study .</criteria>
