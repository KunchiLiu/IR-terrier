The investigator carry separate population-based cohort study use administrative health database eight jurisdiction Canada , US , UK . Cohort entry define initiation oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug , follow-up hospitalization pneumonia end follow-up ( 6 month ) .

	<brief_title>Proton Pump Inhibitors Risk Community-acquired Pneumonia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous observational study find association proton pump inhibitor ( PPIs ) , class medication use treat gastric condition , risk community acquire pneumonia . These study , however , important limitation include confound indication protopathic bias . The purpose study determine whether PPIs increase risk hospitalization community-acquired pneumonia ( HCAP ) . To overcome limitation previous study examine issue , study conduct cohort new user non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) , PPIs often prescribe prophylactically prevent dyspepsia gastric side effect . The investigator use common-protocol approach conduct retrospective cohort study use administrative health care data eight jurisdiction ( Canadian province Alberta , Saskatchewan , Manitoba , Ontario , Quebec , Nova Scotia , well United States ( US ) MarketScan , United Kingdom ( UK ) General Practice Research Database [ GPRD ] ) . Briefly , Canadian database include population-level data physician billing , diagnose procedure hospital discharge abstract , dispensation prescription drug . Alberta , Nova Scotia , Ontario , Quebec data restrict patient age 65 year old prescription data available young patient . For Quebec , 10 % random sample eligible patient use . The GPRD clinical database representative UK population contains record patient see 680 general practitioner practice UK . US MarketScan include individual dependent cover large U.S. employer health insurance plan , government public organization . As Medicare eligibility begin age 65 , US MarketScan data restrict patient age 40 65 year order ensure complete data capture . In jurisdiction , investigator assemble source population include patient prescription oral NSAID ( WHO Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical ( ATC ) Code M01A ) . From source population , study cohort create include patient receive prescription oral NSAID â‰¥ 30 day duration , patient receive short duration prescription unlikely prescribed PPI prophylactic reason . The date prescription ( GPRD ) dispensation ( site ) oral NSAID define date study cohort entry . Patients follow date study cohort entry event ( define ) censor due death , departure database , end follow-up ( 180 day ) , end study period ( September 30 , 2011 last date data availability site ) , whichever occur first . Patients permit enter cohort multiple time provide inclusion criterion meet . The investigator create three mutually exclusive exposure category : 1 ) PPI user , 2 ) H2RA user , 3 ) unexposed patient . The investigator use analysis analogous intention-to-treat approach . Exposure PPIs define prescription PPI ( esomeprazole , omeprazole , pantoprazole , lansoprazole , rabeprazole ) day cohort entry define prescription NSAID . Exposure H2RAs define prescription H2RA ( cimetidine , ranitidine , famotidine , nizatidine , niperotidine , roxatidine , ranitidine bismuth citrate , lafutidine , cimetidine combination , famotidine combination ) day cohort entry define prescription NSAID . Patients consider unexposed defined patient prescribe PPI H2RA day cohort entry define prescription NSAID . The primary outcome define incident HCAP 6 month follow initiation NSAID therapy . Multiple logistic regression use estimate site-specific adjusted odds ratio ( aORs ) correspond 95 % confidence interval ( CIs ) association incident HCAP 6 month PPI exposure . This consider primary analysis . Several sensitivity analysis perform assess robustness study result . Such analysis include : restricting analysis single , random , observation per patient ; exclude patient receive prescription PPI , H2RA , NSAID 12 month cohort entry ; exclude crossover PPI H2RAs . High dimensional propensity score estimate patient cohort use logistic regression . Finally , site-specific estimate meta-analyzed use fix model inverse variance weighting . The amount between-site heterogeneity estimate use I-squared statistic .</detailed_description>
