	<brief_summary>HIV associate sensory neuropathy ( HIV-SN ) frequent complication HIV infection , affect 20 57 % infected individual . The advent well antiretroviral treatment HIV meant mortality HIV decrease dramatically UK . This mean however , chronic , age-related condition associate HIV , HIV-SN cognitive impairment , increase prevalence become significant disease burden . The classification , diagnosis treatment HIV-SN remain poor . Currently , little known genetic basis disorder risk factor mean patient HIV develop neuropathy pain , whilst others . It hop characterise 'phenotyping ' disorder , easy identify patient risk develop neuropathy chronic pain . It may also mean treatment individualise currently patient often undergo frustrate 'trial error ' protocol treatment , clinicians yet predict respond treatment . It also suggest link HIV-SN HIV associate neurocognitive disorder ( HAND ) , another common , age-related complication HIV infection . It may existence one pathology could predict development , presence HAND may impair diagnosis treatment chronic pain associate HIV-SN . This study aim recruit cohort HIV patient without HIV-SN identify genetic risk factor development HIV-SN neuropathic pain . It also aim deeply phenotype condition , use well validate questionnaire , identify influence early neurocognitive dysfunction may report , diagnosis treatment neuropathic pain HIV population .</brief_summary>
