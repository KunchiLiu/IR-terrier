	<detailed_description>This study part BIOVACSAFE project , 5-year project fund Innovative Medicine Initiative , undertake series correlate clinical study apply develop technology generate clinical data inflammation license vaccine benchmark , identify biomarkers predict acceptable reactogenicity , correlation standardize clinical readout inflammatory marker assess natural infection . The purpose protocol generate data undergo integrated system biology analysis validate biomarkers identify exploratory study conduct previously identify new biomarkers responses immunisation The data set include data characterising : 1 . Physiological response various time point immunisation measuring : - Local systemic vaccine-related clinical event . - Haematology ( blood count ESR ) biochemistry parameter . 2 . Innate adaptive immune response include : - Innate immune activation detect global gene expression whole blood - Adaptive humoral immunity determine quantification antibody direct Tetanus toxoid ( TT ) , Diphteria toxoid ( DT ) , Pertussis toxin ( PT ) , Fimbrial haemagglutinin ( FHA ) Pertactin ( PTN ) . - Adaptive immune activation detect gene pathway activation whole blood - Metabolic response detect metabolic gene expression pathway activation whole blood - Innate adaptive immune activation detect measure concentration select soluble mediator serum include : chemokines cytokine acute phase proteins - As exploratory endpoint , adaptive cellular immune response evaluate via count vaccine antigen-specific Cluster Differentiation 4 ( CD4 ) + T cell express activation marker and/or cytokine follow vitro stimulation analysis flow cytometry ( CyTOF ) . 3 . Genetic test subject deem necessary ( genetic test analysis may SNP ( single nucleotide polymorphism ) analysis full genome analysis ) . 4 . Correlations change innate immune activation metabolism adverse event , haematology biochemistry panel , genotype physiological assessment The investigator biobank sample duration BIOVACSAFE programme selectively analyse different sample different time point depend result generate , principally gene expression analysis whole blood .</detailed_description>
