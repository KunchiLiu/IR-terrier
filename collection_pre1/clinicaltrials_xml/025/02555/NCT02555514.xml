	<detailed_description>Osteoarthritis ( OA ) painful debilitate disease synovial joint , affect structural functional integrity articular cartilage , subchondral bone , synovium adjacent support connective tissue . It degenerative disorder characterize cartilage loss high prevalence individual age 55 year . The affected region OA medial compartment knee . The symptom OA include joint pain , stiffness , swell may lead impaired physical function muscle weakness . The etiology disease multifactorial fully understood . Traditionally , OA regard `` wear tear '' disease cause ageing , non-physiological mechanical loading ( e.g . malalignment , obesity , trauma joint instability ) normal joint physiological mechanical load pathological joint induce OA . Joint misalignment identify potential biomechanical risk factor development progression knee OA . Although determination malalignment might provide important information load distribution static condition , dynamic load parameter analyze gait provide information total extrinsic load knee stance phase . According Andriacchi , external knee adduction moment use predict load distribution medial lateral compartment knee dynamic activity . Increased external adduction moment associate increase joint force medial plateau . During walking , force evenly distribute across joint surface approximately 70 % total load pass medial compartment . This may contribute high prevalence OA compartment . It expect patient varus deformity even high proportion load support medial compartment . This may result acceleration articular cartilage degeneration . The link mechanical loading severity progression medial OA show many study . Disease severity find correlate knee adduction moment , knee adduction angular impulse knee extension moment . Miyazaki et al . analyzed disease progression OA patient seven year . Patients show radiographic disease progression medial knee compartment also present severe knee pain great knee adduction moment patient without disease progression . Baliunas et al . observe significant great knee adduction moment OA patient different level disease severity , significant difference find sagittal moment . Thorp et al . analyze knee adduction moment also knee adduction angular impulse stance phase healthy subject OA patient mild moderate disease progression medial knee compartment . The peak knee adduction moment knee adduction angular impulse significant different control group , mild moderate OA patient . Furthermore , parameter knee adduction angular impulse significantly different mild moderate OA patient , suggest parameter describe functional change different stage disease progression . While relationship varus malalignment OA medial compartment well described literature , little information available varus malalignment affect lateral compartment . Fantini Pagani recently demonstrate cartilage mechanical quality relate knee adduction moment gait patient severe OA . Authors report mechanical property osteoarthritic cartilage highly variable indicate complex relationship joint load tissue change degenerative process articular cartilage . In clinical practice , patient identical mechanical varus malalignement low extremity may show either isolated osteoarthritis medial compartment knee ( example 1 ) , OA medial , lateral patellofemoral compartment ( example 2 ) . This entity suggest osteoarthritic disease varus malaligned knee , medial compartment submit excessive overload , progress medial lateral time . It could assume mechanobiological factor inflammatory reaction rather mechanical load transmission play major role disease progression osteoarthritic knee . Mechanobiological factor think cause change articular cartilage thickness distribution joint throughout life . Healthy articular cartilage tend thick joint experience high force knee . In addition , side difference muscle cross sectional area positively correlate side difference articular cartilage morphology . Previous study show , healthy knee , ratio medial lateral cartilage great individual large peak knee adduction moment walking , suggest cartilage thicker area load great . These result support animal study articular cartilage increase thickness 19 23 % high mechanical load apply . An increase cartilage thickness exposure high load may off-set great cartilage surface may cause high physical activity growth . Changes tibio-femoral cartilage thickness dose-dependent suggest adult human cartilage morphology may sensitive improve training . Previous study animal human show disuse like immobilization strenuous mechanical loading induces change cartilage morphology biology . Cartilage composition morphology optimize load-bearing function characterize ability sustain high repetitive mechanical load occur daily living . This mechanical function cartilage directly link composition extracellular matrix ( ECM ) . The synthesis degradation ECM molecule affect mechanical property articular cartilage . The main ECM component collagen II non-collagenous protein proteoglycan aggrecan glycoprotein . Potential biological marker cartilage metabolism include matrix component and/or breakdown product , cytokine , protease ( eg . metalloproteases ) quantify serum , urine synovial sample . Several serum biomarkers identify monitor cartilage metabolism . One establish biomarker monitoring cartilage metabolism relation joint degeneration OA , rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) injure knee cartilage oligomeric matrix protein ( COMP ) . In addition , previous study report increase serum COMP concentration immediately exercise dose mechanical load determine magnitude duration increase serum COMP concentration . Besides COMP , biomarker collagen II aggrecan synthesis degradation suitable monitor cartilage metabolism . Moreover , microRNAs play pivotal role extracellular matrix homeostasis detectable specific stage OA progression . So far , miR-140 , miR-9 , miR-98 miR-146 find upregulated osteoarthritic patient material expression link IL-1 beta induced production TNF-alpha matrix degradation osteoarthritic cartilage . miRNAs release serum various disease may prognostic potential determine onset progression cartilage degeneration OA . Finally , mitochondrion damage link reduced ECM production , secretion enhance degradation cartilage . Recent report show specific inhibitor mitochondrial respiratory chain suppress synthesis ECM articular chondrocytes induce production proinflammatory cytokine multiple factor release damage mitochondrion , e.g damage mitochondrial DNA , reactive oxygen specie , cytochrome c , proline/hydroxyproline synthesis , ATP lactate production , could act biomarkers OA . Inflammation within joint knee important pathophysiologic process occur onset OA high mechanical load . Cytokines key player inflammatory mechanism contribute progression cartilage damage . Therefore , investigator focus effect inflammation OA role pro-inflammatory anti-inflammatory cytokine cause deleterious beneficial outcome . Investigation underlie mechanism help investigator understand cytokine contribute progression OA provide potential target novel therapeutic biomarkers diagnosis prognosis OA . Differences cytokine profile report patient OA , RA healthy control . Specific cytokine involve OA previously detect blood well synovial fluid . Cytokine expression fluid may represent reliable diagnostic marker early late stage OA . Recent data indicate potential correlation cytokine profile blood synovial fluid , validated investigation . In addition , investigator want analyze cytokine profile tissue sample OA correlate result profile serum synovial fluid clinical parameter . These result could link inflammatory reaction induce OA medial compartment malalignment progression OA unaffected area lateral compartment . In summary , great knee adduction moment associate great load transmission medial knee compartment . Numerous study identify increased knee adduction moment patient medial knee OA varus deformity compare healthy subject . However , unclear varus malalignment dynamic knee load / adduction moment affect cartilage lateral compartment . Morphological biochemical marker able analyse cartilage degeneration vivo human relation mechanical loading , potential biomechanical risk factor development progression knee OA .</detailed_description>
