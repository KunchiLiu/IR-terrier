	<brief_summary>This observational , single center study evaluate acoustic accelerometer-based measure voice speech sufficient precision detect change lung fluid status patient confirm acute heart failure syndrome pulmonary congestion . The study shall conduct concordance United States FDA regulation non-significant risk study . Patients admit acute heart failure syndrome pulmonary congestion expect stay great 3 4 day , willing able sign inform consent , meet inclusion/exclusion criterion , identify clinical investigator , enrol study . Results study evaluate sensitivity voice speech measure detect change lung fluid status symptomatic population . Up 12 subject enrol comparatively evaluate voice outcome measure pilot study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There two specific aim first phase project : 1 . Collect short-term acoustic accelerometric data group patient volume overload successful diuresis amount fluid large enough permit robust statistical test derived measure . 2 . Determine whether direct measure ( base previously-developed approach acoustic ACC-based monitoring vocal function differentiate hypervolemic optivolemic pattern . 2.2 Justification Clinical Study The study evaluate acoustic accelerometric measure voice speech production sensitivity detect clinically significant change lung fluid status patient confirm acute heart failure syndrome pulmonary congestion . Changes lung fluid acute heart failure syndrome difficult diagnose evaluate . A blinded observational methodology choose appropriate study design understand change lung fluid value patient acute heart failure syndrome pulmonary congestion . The primary endpoint significant correlation change voice speech characteristic change total body water measure change weight hospital admission . 2.3 Measurement Precision Exploratory endpoint determine distribution lung fluid value patient confirm acute heart failure syndrome determine acoustic accelerometer-based measurement sufficient sensitivity detect change lung fluid status symptomatic hospitalize population . The establishment underlie etiology heart failure help determine may contribute symptomology change acoustic accelerometric measure voice speech production . The type analyse performed airborne acoustic ( microphone ) signal somewhat limited level background noise record environment , particularly respect acoustic measure related voice quality . For reason propose recording voice/speech production pilot study obtain simultaneously microphone neck-placed miniature accelerometer ( ACC ) . The ACC relatively immune environmental noise , able extract voice quality-related measure ACC signal . The ACC easily place anterior neck clavicular notch use double-sided medical grade adhesive tape ( see Figure 1 ) . The record protocol comprise : 1 ) sustain vowel , 2 ) standard sentence read passage , 3 ) 30 second spontaneous speech . Recordings make , , acute episode Congestive Heart Failure ( CHF ) . Each record session take less 10 minute . 3 STUDY PROTOCOL 3.1 Study Design Objective - see 3.2 Study Duration Enrollment trial expect take approximately 4 month include enrollment . 3.2.1 Enrollment Procedure Follow-up Procedure Patients screen enrolled prior admission require medical management . Subjects enrol study baseline voice recording make within 24 hour admission . Following index measurement , subject record perform daily within first 96 hour discharge and/re reaching presume dry weight . At discretion investigator , voice recording may obtain frequently per day hospital admission maximum ten ( 10 ) day . Inclusion Exclusion Criteria : see 4.0 OutComes - See primary secondary endpoint 5 Statistical Methods 5.1 Introduction This observational study . Subjects enrol study throughout inpatient stay maximum 10 day . The objective statistical analysis determine via Pearson correlation voice speech measure sufficient precision detect clinically significant change overall volume status experience acute heart failure syndrome . 5.2 Confirmation reduction body fluid volume In order confirm clinically significant reduction overall volume status occur voice record period , cardiologist review relevant medical record pertain patient independently determine admission result reduction volume overload . They access source medical record additional information become available evaluation hospital environment . This information include follow : read chest roentgenogram obtain emergency department inpatient stay radiologist , medical history obtain medical chart available emergency department physician time presentation , result subsequent test , echocardiography , radionuclide angiography , leave ventriculography , perform time cardiac catheterization , hospital course patient admitted hospital . 6 Statistical Analysis 6.1 . Data Analyses Digital signal processing approach extract follow measure acoustic ACC signal : A . Sustained vowel : measure related voice quality include perturbation ( jitter shimmer ) signal-to-noise level ( harmonics-to-noise , spectral , cepstral measure ) , frequency location subglottal resonance . B . Connected speech ( sentence , reading , spontaneous speech ) : measure relate sound segment , suprasegmental , utterance length parameter include pitch ( fundamental frequency ) , loudness ( relative sound pressure level ) , articulation/timing ( sound segment duration , vocalic formant transition , pause ) . 7 Study Visits 7.1 Pre-Enrollment Evaluations Parameters Pre-enrollment procedure protocols subject follow standard hospital practice , minimum , include follow : - Subject demographic - History physical exam , include weight - Medical history - Dyspnea quantify VAS instrument - Blood NT-proBNP level 7.2 During Enrollment - Voice assessment - Weight vital sign - Dyspnea visual analog scale ( DVAS ) - Global assessment symptom ( GVAS ) - N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide NTproBNP 7.3 At Discharge ( deem dry weight ) assessment ( max 10 day post admission ) - Voice assessment - Weight vital sign - Dyspnea visual analog scale ( DVAS ) - Global assessment symptom ( GVAS ) - ( NTproBNP )</detailed_description>
