	<detailed_description>This prospective , international , multicenter outcome cohort study . This study start moment patient visit outpatient clinic 3 6 month diagnosis acute PE part routine medical care . If patient consent study participation , CTEPH clinical prediction score calculate . This score consist 6 variable assess time PE diagnosis : unprovoked PE ( +6 point ) , know hypothyroidism ( +3 point ) , diagnostic delay &gt; 2 week ( +3 point ) , right ventricular dysfunction compute tomography pulmonary angiography ( CTPA ) echocardiography ( +2 point ) , know diabetes mellitus ( -3 point ) thrombolytic therapy embolectomy acute PE event ( -3 point ) CTEPH consider present patient low probability ( ≤6 point ) symptoms suggestive CTEPH , i.e . dyspnea exertion , edema , newly develop palpitation , syncope chest pain . The remain patient either high probability ( &gt; 6 point ) report symptom may associate CTEPH subject 'rule-out criterion ' . CTEPH assume present patient age- gender dependent normal NT-proBNP level ( define assay 's manufacturer ) , absence 3 ECG criterion : 1 ) rSR ' rSr ' pattern lead V1 , 2 ) R : S &gt; 1 lead V1 R &gt; 0.5mV 3 ) QRS axis &gt; 90o . Patients abnormal result 'rule-out criterion ' refer transthoracic echocardiography . All echocardiogram judge echocardiographic criterion suspect PH accord 2015 ESC guideline . In case echocardiographic intermediate high probability PH , patient refer diagnostic work-up suspect CTEPH start perfusion lung scan VQ-scan right heart catheterization , result discuss independent interdisciplinary work group PH specialist , ensure optimal diagnostic management . This latter diagnostic work-up abnormal echocardiograph lie within set standard medical care . All patient diagnose pulmonary hypertension origin , NYHA class III IV heart failure due leave ventricular systolic dysfunction , leave ventricular diastolic dysfunction significant valvular lesion , follow total 2 year index PE diagnosis . During period , study protocol interfere standard patient care , allow diagnostic test deem indicated treat physician include echocardiography case new respiratory symptom .
