	<brief_title>Effects Simultaneous Balance Resistance Training Older Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : In course aging , physical ability gradually decline . Even though cause fall assume multifactorial , loss muscle strength balance control seem crucial intrinsic risk factor fall . Several meta-analysis review emphasise positive effect resistance , balance combine exercise intervention measure strength , power balance performance thus intrinsic ( i.e. , person-related ) risk factor fall . Pure balance well pure resistance training effective improve postural control ( e.g. , gait measure , leg extension strength ) reducing risk fall elderly people . Combined resistance balance training describe general sequential concurrent training program , resistance balance exercise execute consecutive order within training session . These exercise intervention show positive effect well . Merging resistance balance training , execute simultaneously investigate regard fall prevention elderly people yet . In past 15 year , research simultaneous resistance balance training , call 'instability resistance training ' ( IRT ) , grow . IRT utilise unstable device ( Swiss ball , BOSU® ball , wobble board , etc . ) external load ( e.g. , weight ) . This training modality show affect core lower limb muscle activation positively , improve balance comparable gain measure strength analogue traditional resistance training . Kibele Behm , example , find superior improvement single leg hop follow IRT healthy young adult . They conclude line principle training specificity , IRT induce high balance adaption , prominent balance demand singe leg hop . Further , Behm Colado recommend IRT elderly people study investigate effect different kind IRT old adult . Granacher colleague examine effect core instability strength training ( CIT ) measure trunk muscle strength , spinal mobility , dynamic balance functional mobility old adult . They find meaningful improvement measure strength , balance mobility comparison control group . Another study , investigate effect swiss ball exercise program older adult , find positive effect measure physical fitness balance comparison control group . Based used exercise , study focus strengthen core improve mainly balance ability . In slightly different approach improve balance old woman , Chulvi-Medrano colleague utilized lower-limb training program use unstable T-Bow® device . The training group improve measure dynamic , static overall balance , whereas control group experience decline change balance ability . All three aforementioned study utilise unstable device none incorporate additional load within training program , hence resistance component IRT limit bodyweight . Hence , lack literature support evidence feasibility effectiveness IRT incorporate additional load resistance improve measure strength , power balance elderly people . To investigator knowledge , study conduct yet , investigate effect IRT additional load resistance risk factor fall elderly people . Measures : Data acquire biomechanics laboratory . Questionnaires complete separated room . All test conduct explain , use standardise verbal instruction regard test procedure maintain equal treatment participant . A single assessment last 90 min per participant . Strength / power assessment : Well establish clinical biomechanical test administer measure primary outcome muscle strength power . In accordance recommendation Granacher et al . strength assessment perform balance assessment reduce interfere effect muscle fatigue . Further , strength balance test administer random order within respective block . One practice trial provide every test . Test procedure conduct accord recommendation Gschwind et al . state otherwise . Two test trial execute use mean statistical analysis . Except maximal isometric leg extension strength hand grip strength . There , good value two consecutive trial use statistical analysis . In trial , sufficient recovery period provide reduce fatigue . Maximal isometric leg extension strength ( ILES ) examine cable pull device ( Takei A5002 , Fitness Monitors , Wrexham , England ) upright body posture . Individual cable length choose ensure knee angle approximately 135° . Participants ask start `` pull [ ing ] initially moderate intensity slowly increase intensity maximum exertion keep upper body extend upright '' prevent injury . To ensure upright posture , participant instruct maintain contact shoulder wall lift scapula pull . The test repeat least one minute measurement . The ILES show excellent test-retest reliability ( ICC = .98 ) leg extension strength . To measure handgrip strength Takei hand dynamometer ( Takei A5401 , Fitness Monitors , Wrexham , England ) use . Participants stand upright arm align body squeeze device hard could , use dominant hand . The handle 's width adjust participant 's hand size . The intermediate phalanx place inner handle . The Takei handy dynamometer show excellent test-retest reliability ( ICC = .95 ) . In addition isometric strength , power test conduct . Supplementary standard Chair Rise Test ( CRT ) stable surface , test trial record stand foam pad ( AIREX© ) well . Participants stand sit five time quickly could , without aid arm . Therefore , arm fold across upper body . Time measure ordinary stop watch near .01 second . After countdown `` ready-set-go '' , test time start stop participant sit fifth time . For CRT high test-retest reliability show ( ICC = .89 ) . In addition , stair climb power test administer . This test show meaningful association mobility performance strength measure . Ascent descent time record separately power calculate follow formula : P = ( ( M x D ) x g ) /t , P = Power ( Watt ) , M = Body mass ( kg ) , D = Vertical distance cover ( meter ) , = Time ( second ) g = 9.8 ( constant gravity ) . Participants instruct walk quickly safely 9-step flight stair ( 17 cm step height ) . Time start cue go stop second foot reach top step and/or floor , respectively . Use handrail allow safety reason . Time measure ordinary stop watch near .01 second . Test-retest reliability show excellent ( r = .99 ) . Balance : Dynamic steady-state balance test walk 10-m walkway , measure temporal-spatial gait variable ( stride length ( cm ) , double support time ( % ) , speed ( m/s ) , step width ( cm ) ) use two-dimensional OptoGait© system ( Microgait , Bozano , Italy ) . In addition coefficient variation compute ( CV = ( SD/mean ) x 100 ) . The OptoGait© system show high interclass correlation coefficient ( ICC 's = .93 - .99 ) high concurrent validity OptoGait© system previously validate system . Participants ask walk 10 footwear self-selected pace three time calculate test-retest reliability . Because OptoGait© system able record automatically , start signal necessary . A three-minute interval give individual trial rest , save data well prepare next trial . At start end walkway sufficient distance provide accelerate decelerate safely . In addition , first last step exclude analysis eliminate possible acceleration deceleration bias . Each trial record 1000 Hz use manufacture provide OptoGait© software run laptop computer ( Lenovo ThinkPad T530 ) . Proactive balance test use Functional Reach Test ( FRT ) Timed Go Test ( TUG ) . The FRT measure maximal distance participant able reach forward stand . For purpose , participant instruct lift dominant arm reach forward far could without take step forward . Maximal reach distance ( cm ) assess . The FRT show excellent test-retest reliability elderly people ( ICC = .92 ) . FRT trial repeat participant able maintain foot ground fix position . In addition standard FRT solid surface , test trial record stand foam pad ( AIREX© ) well . For TUG , participant ask rise chair walk three meter normal walk speed around cone , return sit . Time TUG record ordinary stopwatch near .01 second command `` ready-set-go '' stop soon participant sit . The TUG show excellent test-retest reliability ( ICC = .99 ) old adult . To test reactive balance , Push Release Test ( PRT ) use . The PRT rate postural response sudden perturbation . Participants instruct push backwards examiner 's hand regain balance examiner release hand . The number step require regain balance count correspond score record ( 0 = 1 step , 1 = 2-3 small step backwards independent recovery , 2 = ≥4 step independent recovery , 3 = step assistance recovery , 4 = fall unable stand without assistance ) . For detailed description PRT see Jacobs colleague . The PRT show high test-retest reliability ( ICC = .84 ) sensitivity 89 % specificity 85 % . Questionnaires : Psychosocial function assess use several questionnaire . Global cognition test use MMSE , reliable test assess cognitive function show high test-retest reliability ( r = .89 ) . The CDT FAB-D use assess executive function . Inter-rater reliability CDT show high ( IRR = .92 ) sensitivity specificity value .50 .84 , respectively . Falls self-efficacy measure use German version FES-I . This test show excellent internal validity ( Cronbach 's alpha = .96 ) test-retest reliability ( r = .96 ) ass level fear fall . To assess health-related physical activity , exercise amount energy expenditure , FQoPA conduct . Frey colleague show FQoPA score correlate maximum oxygen uptake , indicate high validity ( r = .42 ) . Design exercise intervention : Participants stratify three intervention group base equal distribution age equal gender ratio . The allocation training program occur randomly . Intervention group one conduct 'traditional ' machine-based resistance training ( M-RT ) . Intervention group two ( machine-based instability resistance - M-IRT ) follow similar training program exercise-machines , additional unstable device place participant exercise-machine floor respectively . The third intervention group conduct free-weight resistance training unstable device ( F-IRT ) use dumbbell instead exercise-machines . All intervention group train 10 week , twice per week non-consecutive day 60 min . The 10-week intervention period consist one week introductory phase three major train block last three week . Training intensity progressively individually increase 10-week training program modulate load set group level instability group M-IRT F-IRT . After week one , four seven train load ( weight ) increase follow 1RM ( one repetition maximum - maximum amount force generate within one repetition ) test exercise . Since load 1RM heavy untrained elderly , train load calculate use prediction equation provide Epley , show .03 % deviation actual achieve 1RM squat correlation .97 . Instructors make sure repetition exceed 15-20 , 1RM predication accuracy high few repetition . Training unstable condition , especially additional weight , implies certain degree accident risk . Therefore instability exercise secure instructor additional aid like box . Training supervise skilled instructor . For first two week participant instructor ratio 5:1 , afterwards 10:1 . Since effectiveness resistance training prevent fall report frequently , intervention group one ( M-RT ) act active control group . In study Orr colleague , participant comparable baseline characteristic show significant high treatment effect comparison passive control group ( p &lt; .001 ) . Since aim study compare untested intervention ( IRT ) effective treatment ( RT ) , investigator decide implement active instead passive control group design . Intervention program : All three intervention group conduct resistance training program consist three main exercise , warm-up cool-down phase . Participants perform 10 min low-intensity step stair-walker brief warm-up begin training session . The core part intervention exercise focus strengthen leg extension muscle . Therefore squat-movements chosen , recommend Flanagan colleague . M-RT M-IRT group perform squat Smith machine , fix barbell hip level . Pilot test reveal shoulder lower back mobility elderly limit fix barbell shoulder . In addition , M-IRT group use instability device ( e.g . BOSU ball , wobble board , inflatable disc ) place foot . Instability device use F-IRT group well , perform squat dumbbell instead barbell . As secondary leg extension exercise , leg-press M-RT M-IRT ( use instability device put foot foot plate ) chosen . The front lunge ( dumbbell ) use secondary exercise F-IRT group . To strengthen core , bridge exercise incorporated training program . Again , group M-IRT F-IRT use instability device place shoulder foot addition . Statistics : An priori power analysis use G*Power 3.1 assume type I error .05 type II error .10 ( 90 % statistical power ) compute determine appropriate sample size achieve statistically significant interaction effect . The calculation base study assess effect core instability strength train old adult . The analysis reveal necessity 54 participant ( 18 per group ) obtain medium ( .24 ≤ f ≤ .39 ) `` time x group '' interaction effect . Considering likelihood dropout decide recruit 66 participant compensate possible dropout rate 20 % . Prior main analysis normal distribution test Kolmogorov-Smirnov test dependent variable . In addition , Levene 's test equality variance conduct . We test baseline difference group one-way ANOVA Kruskal-Wallis test depend distribution homogeneity . In order test hypothesis , 3 ( group : M-RT , M-IRT &amp; F-IRT ) x 2 ( time : pre- post-test ) ANOVA , repeat measure time calculate . In case distribution homogeneity violation non-parametric Friedman Kruskal-Wallis test compute control result parametrical test non-parametrical variable . If difference detect , non-parametrical result express . Because Bonferroni-correction multiple comparison find conservative , Ryan-Holm-Bonferroni adjusted post-hoc test use analyse significant `` time x group '' interaction tendency ( .051 ≤ p &lt; .10 ) . Independent t-tests Mann Whitney-U use identify difference group . Ryan-Holm-Bonferroni correct p-values report . In addition , difference absolute train intensity within last training block analyse . Thus , train load squat movement , common group , use . Differences compute use one-way ANOVA . Dependent distribution homogeneity , Ryan-Holm-Bonferroni adjust post-hoc test ( independent t-test Mann Whitney-U ) compute detect difference group . Changes variable within group calculate formula ∆ % = ( ( Meanpre / Meanpost ) - 1 ) x 100 . The effect size ANOVAs ' determine calculate Cohen 's f. Following Cohen , f-values ≤ .24 indicate small effect , .25 ≤ f ≤ .39 indicate medium effect f ≥ .40 indicate large effect . For post-hoc test Cohen 's calculate . Following Cohen , d-values ≤ .49 indicate small effect , .50 ≤ ≤ .79 indicate medium effect ≥ .80 indicate large effect . Significance level set α = 5 % . All analysis perform use SPSS version 21.0 ( SPSS Inc. , Chicago , IL , USA ) .</detailed_description>
