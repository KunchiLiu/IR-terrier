	<brief_summary>Colonoscopy ( examine colon flexible tube camera ) usually do screening purpose find precancerous lesion ( polyp ) early stage . During colonoscopy doctor advance colonoscope end colon start examine colon polyp . `` Withdrawal time '' period time doctor spend examine colon . Doctors usually spend six minute examine colon reach end colon . Studies show spend withdrawal time detect lesion . The proposal dedicate half withdrawal time colonoscopy examine right side increase detection polyp right side colon . There change procedural aspect colonoscopy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Utility Time Segmental Withdrawal During Screening Colonoscopy Increasing Adenoma Detection Rate .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Screening colonoscopy essential diagnostic tool early detection precancerous colonic lesion , prevent progression lesion cancer . Population-based case control study find 50 % reduction colo-rectal cancer ( CRC ) incidence one-third reduction mortality CRC screen colonoscopy . The effectiveness colonoscopy prevent colon cancer dependent adenoma detection rate ( ADR ) procedure . Studies demonstrate withdrawal time 6 minute higher rate detection neoplasia . In 2006 joint task force American College Gastroenterology American Society Gastrointestinal Endoscopy change recommendation indicate average withdrawal time exceed 6 minute normal colonoscopy polypectomy biopsy perform . Based recommendation , 6-minute benchmark current standard care . Longer mean withdrawal time associated increase adenoma detection , mainly small right-sided adenoma proximal serrate adenomas , presumably due long inspection right colon . However , also show withdrawal time use 6 minute threshold strong predictor likelihood find polyp colonoscopy use quality indicator . New CRC diagnosis within 3 year negative screen colonoscopy high 6 % . Right-sided lesion , flat polyp , variability endoscopist quality measure potential reason interval cancer develop . A recent observational study publish show increase ADR implementation protocol careful inspection minimum 8 minute establish . The investigator hypothesize colonoscopists would spend least half time withdrawal time right side colon ( refer segment protocol ) , ADR increase mainly due detection lesion right side , could miss otherwise . The investigator conduct single center randomize trial investigate utility time segmental withdrawal least 3 minute right leave side colon respectively , compare regular 6 minute total withdrawal time regardless time spend colon .</detailed_description>
