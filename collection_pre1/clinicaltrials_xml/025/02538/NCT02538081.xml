	<detailed_description>Basic investigation animal human point increase cholinergic neurotransmission one possible mechanism clozapine olanzapine 's enhanced therapeutic effect . However , specific clinical trial determine stimulation nicotinic cholinergic receptor would capture enhancement safer patient . In Clinical Antipsychotic Trials Intervention Effectiveness ( CATIE ) assign risperidone olanzapine significantly high discontinuation rate , primary reason lack efficacy . Olanzapine assignment patient associate continue weight gain , see patient assign risperidone . Many patient assign olanzapine risperidone discontinue intolerability olanzapine , metabolic problem chief reason . Thus , risperidone safe drug , equally effective patient , others olanzapine continue effective tolerate despite metabolic effect . The baseline rate entry study typical survey chronically ill patient population ; twice many receive olanzapine receive risperidone , suggest clinician choose treat many patient olanzapine , despite side effect , well antipsychotic drug . This study propose conduct clinical trial comparison olanzapine combination nicotinic cholinergic agonist , 3- [ 2,4-Dimethoxybenzylidene ] anabaseine ( DMXB-A ) dopamine D2 receptor antagonist , mechanism common antipsychotic drug , test hypothesis 7-nicotinic receptor agonism may additional necessary factor enhances efficacy olanzapine allows slight superiority risperidone . In pilot data , investigator study 11 patient receive DMXB-A 300 mg plus olanzapine 20 mg ( n=5 ) risperidone 4 mg ( n=6 ) . The investigator find DMXB-A improved performance Measurement Treatment Research Improve Cognition Schizophrenia ( MATRICS ) mean battery score risperidone-treated patient level olanzapine-treated patient . This trial would enroll patient take olanzapine record baseline measurement clinical symptom , cognition , metabolic parameter , extrapyramidal side effect . The subject would randomize receive either risperidone risperidone plus DMXB-A 6 week would measurements clinical symptom , cognition , metabolic parameter extrapyramidal side effect .</detailed_description>
