	<brief_summary>This study consist 2 part : Phase 1b Phase 2 . Phase 1 b evaluate safety tolerability combination idelallisib anti-CD37 monoclonal antibody BI 836826 participant relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( R/R CLL ) , establish maximum recommended Phase 2 combination dose ( highRP2D ) well alternate low recommended Phase 2 combination dose ( lowRP2D ) . Phase 2 determine rate complete response ( CR ) minimal residual disease ( MRD ) negativity combination highRP2D lowRP2D participant R/R CLL .</brief_summary>

For Phase 2 individual either : At least 1 node ≥ 2 cm compute tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) bone marrow exam perform screen demonstrates quantifiable CLL . Discontinuation cytotoxic chemotherapy antiCD20 antibody therapy ≥ 4 week , alemtuzumab ≥ 8 week , target therapy ≥ 2 week , investigational therapy ≥ 3 week enrollment ( Phase 1b ) randomization ( Phase 2 ) . For individual relapse CLL recently treat Bcell receptor ( BCR ) pathway inhibitor , opinion investigator , tolerate wait 3 week , washout period &gt; 5 halflives allow . If systemic corticosteroid , dose must stable previous 4 week .
