	<brief_summary>The primary aim propose project characterize dual tasking ( DT ) deficit improve motor , cognitive , quality life outcomes individual Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) . Phase 1 intervention involve in-depth gait analysis 15 individual PD . This gait analysis utilize Computer Assisted Rehabilitation Environment ( CAREN ) system , virtual reality system fully integrated 3-D motion capture system . The purpose Phase 1 generalize characteristic gait postural control specific DT condition . Phase 2 ( N=20 ) involve clinical translation finding . This phase involve create clinical intervention base objective information gather CAREN system . The intervention take place 3x/week total 8 week . Interventional group include : 1 ) DT clinical group ( N=10 ) 2 ) Single task group ( N=10 ) . Outcome measure use begin end intervention ass feasibility efficacy intervention .</brief_summary>
