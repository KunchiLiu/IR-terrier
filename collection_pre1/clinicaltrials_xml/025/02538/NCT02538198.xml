	<criteria>Patients plasma cell myeloma treat induction therapy reinduction therapy , time study enrollment document evidence stable disease response well accord International Myeloma Workshop Consensus Panel Age ≥18 year . Because dose adverse event data currently available use lenalidomide patient &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study , may eligible future pediatric trial ECOG performance status ≤ 2 Patient must adequate hematologic , renal , hepatic , define : Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.0K /μL ( growth factor support permissible ) Platelets ≥ 75K/μL ( transfusion permissible ) Hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL ( transfusion permissible ) Creatinine clearance ( CrCl ) great equal 40 mL/min . use CKDEPI formula ( see Appendix C ) . If CrCl base CKDEPI formula &lt; 40 mL/min , patient 24 hr urine collection measure CrCl . The measured CrCl must also ≥ 40 ml/min . Total bilirubin ≤ 2 mg/dL , AST ( SGOT ) ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 3 x ULN All study participant must register mandatory Revlimid REMS® program , willing able comply requirement REMS® program . Females childbearing potential* must negative serum urine pregnancy test sensitivity least 50 mIU/mL within 10 14 day within24 hour prior prescribe lenalidomide Cycle 1 ( prescription must fill within 7 day require Revlimid REMS® ) must either commit continued abstinence heterosexual intercourse begin TWO acceptable method birth control , one highly effective method one additional effective method AT THE SAME TIME , least 28 day start take lenalidomide . *A female childbearing potential sexually mature female : 1 ) undergone hysterectomy ( surgical removal uterus ) bilateral oophorectomy ( surgical removal ovary ) 2 ) naturally postmenopausal ( amenorrhea follow cancer therapy rule childbearing potential ) least 24 consecutive month ( i.e. , menses time precede 24 consecutive month ) . Females childbearing potential must adhere scheduled pregnancy test require Revlimid REMS® program . Men must agree use latex condom sexual contact female childbearing potential even successful vasectomy . See Appendix B : Lenalidomide Risks Fetal Exposure , Pregnancy Testing Guidelines Acceptable Birth Control Methods . Patients must able take daily prophylactic anticoagulation medication , : aspirin ( 81 325 mg ) warfarin low molecular weight heparin medication clinically indicate . Patient must understand voluntarily sign informed consent form , understanding patient may withdraw consent time without prejudice future medical care . Patients progressive refractory plasma cell myeloma , define International Myeloma Workshop Consensus Panel criterion . Refractory lenalidomide recent line therapy , define International Myeloma Consensus Panel criterion [ 47 ] failure achieve minimal response development progressive disease lenalidomide within 30 day lenalidomide therapy Patients receive investigational agent intent treat myeloma . Permitted concurrent therapy include : Bisphosphonates Plasma cell leukemia Pregnant breastfeeding female . Because potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother lenalidomide , lactate female must agree breast feed take lenalidomide . Uncontrolled hypertension diabetes Active hepatitis B C infection Diagnosed treat another malignancy within 3 year prior study enrollment , exception complete resection nonmelanoma skin cancer , situ malignancy . Previous diagnosis another malignancy evidence residual disease Patients seropositive human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , and/or take antiretroviral treatment HIV/AIDS . Prior organ transplant require immunosuppressive therapy Prior allogeneic stem cell transplant Patients require continuous , systemic immunosuppressive therapy Patients myocardial infarction within 6 month prior enrollment , New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class III IV heart failure , uncontrolled angina , severe uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia , electrocardiographic evidence acute ischemia Patients condition would prevent absorption study drug Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include limited uncontrolled infection psychiatric illness/social situation would compromise compliance study requirement Significant neuropathy ≥Grade 3 baseline Contraindication concomitant anticoagulation prophylaxis Major surgery within 1 month prior enrollment Patients previously expose develop severe adverse event , hypersensitivity desquamate rash either thalidomide lenalidomide</criteria>
