	<brief_summary>This propose study determine whether exercise intervention avoids continuous supervision exercise-related ischemic pain improves walk performance 52-week follow-up people PAD . Our intervention directly address two aspect current practice guideline major barrier exercise patient PAD : 1 ) recommendation supervise exercise 2 ) recommendation high intensity ischemic-pain induce walking exercise .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Low InTensity Exercise Intervention PAD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We randomize 305 PAD participant one three parallel arm : Group 1 : Low-intensity , self-paced walking exercise ; Group 2 : Standard high intensity , ischemic pain-inducing walking exercise ; Group 3 : Non-exercising attention control group . The low high intensity exercise group attend center-based exercise session per week four week follow transition entirely home-based exercise program additional 48 week ( 52 week total ) . The low high intensity exercise intervention use identical self-regulatory support strategy . However , low intensity exercise group instruct exercise minimal ischemic leg discomfort high intensity group instruct exercise maximal ischemic leg pain . These two distinct exercise prescription reinforce 48 week home-based exercise , use well-validated behavioral coaching model deliver telephone weekly . Our primary outcome change six-minute walk distance 52-week follow-up . If hypothesis correct , million people PAD benefit alternative exercise regimen accessible 8 million people U.S. suffer PAD .</detailed_description>
