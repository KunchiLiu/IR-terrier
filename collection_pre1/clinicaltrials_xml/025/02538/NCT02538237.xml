	<brief_summary>Aim : Use ibuprofen mouthwash 2 % irrigate subgingival improve progression periodontal disease evaluate . Materials Methods : 22 patient chronic periodontitis without systemic disease periodontal disease , 2 molar periodontal pocket deeper 4 mm either side low jaw clinical examination . Interventions : For patient participate study , subject receive oral hygiene instruction scale root planing ( SRP ) , After 2 week , They divide two group determine randomization study , Experimental group : ibuprofen 2 % mouthwash ( make Faculty Pharmaceutical Sciences , Islamic Azad University , Tehran ) , Control group : placebo , Subgingival Irrigation ibuprofen 2 % mouthwash insulin syringe 0.5 ml rinse , Clinical measurement include probe depth ( PD ) , clinical attachment level ( CAL ) , Plaque Index ( PI ) , Bleeding Index ( BI ) record patient recall per every 2 week 3 month repetitive , end 3 month , evaluate change clinical periodontal parameter . ®</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients method Eligible participant 22 adult patient treat chronic periodontitis participate supportive periodontal therapy program Department Periodontology Dental Clinic Islamic Azad University , Dental Branch Tehran include current study ; Recruitment participant start November 2013 end September 2014 . The study meet criterion Helsinki Declaration of1975 , revise 2008 . The survey plan review sanctioned , approve ethic commission Institutional Ethical Committee Review Board Deputy Research , School Dentistry . All subject receive oral write explanation intent survey sign informed consent receive detailed information purpose , benefit , possible risk associate trial . Individuals satisfy follow entry criterion recruit : - Diagnosed suffer initial ( early ) moderate chronic periodontitis ; - Adult patient , 28 year old least 20 remain teeth least three teeth quadrant ; - The presence least two residual site probe pocket depth ( PPD≥4 mm two opposite quadrant , show bleed upon probe , radiographically comparable amount periodontal breakdown good match tooth type , also clinical minimal radiographic sign initial ( early ) moderate ( clinical attachment level 1 3mm . Exclusion criterion : Periodontal treatment ( non-surgical ) previous six month Systemic disease ; Hypersensitive Ibuprofen ; Systemic antibiotic anti-inflammatory drug within three month precede begin study ; Pregnant nursing female ; Smoking ; No acute periodontal condition , necrotizing periodontal disease periodontal abscess . Mouth rinse entire period study orthodontic treatment , Use removable denture , Extensive dental restoration . Clinical measurement The following clinical outcome variable record baseline , within 7 day 3 month select teeth , six site per tooth , mean periodontal probe ( William's® probe , Hu-Friedy , USA ) two calibrate blind examiner : - Plaque index ( PI ) use Silness &amp; Loe index ( 18 ) . - Bleeding probing ( BOP ) , visual inspection 30 probing , ( Score 0 : No bleed probing . Score 1 : A single discrete bleed point appear probe ) ( 19 ) . - Probing pocket depth ( PPD ) millimeter , measure gingival margin deep stop periodontal pocket standardize force . - Clinical attachment level ( CAL ) , calculate add PPD site . Examiner calibration reproducibility ensure duplicate measurement four periodontitis patient , include study , one-day interval , prior start survey . Repetitive measurement within 1mm difference 91.5 % recording . Study design intervention study randomize , placebo-controlled , parallel , split-mouth design 3-months clinical trial . Treatment phase I : instruction oral hygiene procedure enter study , patient receive following procedure : - Individualized oral hygiene instruction together provision new toothbrush , dental floss , fluoridate dentifrice . - Full-mouth periodontal examination ultrasonic instrument supragingival professional prophylaxis use . Treatment phase II : After patient selection ; use block randomization block size 4 allocation ratio 1:1 Block randomization choose prevent much variability number patient randomized ensure reasonably steady flow patient treatment group , Allocation cover ensure use container label reveal content trial drug package blind therapist clinical examiner . Also , test placebo mouthwash similar color . Patients randomly assign either A B group , mandibular arch divide two part ( leave right section ) ; 60 site group ; individual receive scale root plan first visit accordance one-stage full-mouth debridement protocol ( scaled mean ultrasonic device ) + professional cleaning ; The therapeutic endpoint define clean root surface without visible clinically detectable remnant biofilm calculus , since two week , mouthwash apply periodontal pocket PD ≥4 mm use syringe blunt cannula ; After isolate dry select site , assign ibuprofen mouthwash 2 % formulation ( make Islamic Azad university pharmaceutical science branch ) subgingivally apply use needle blunt tip lateral opening avoid trauma tissue . Follow-up visit schedule 0 , 7 , 14 day , within three month . At visit , follow clinical outcome variable record baseline within seven day three month select teeth William 's periodontal probe ; six site per tooth . Oral hygiene reinforce visit , treatment provide . Within visit , patient provide full-mouth professional prophylaxis . At every visit , occurrence undesirable side effect adverse event could relate treatment record , include change teeth oral mucosa . Statistical analysis sample size calculate use follow formula : α=00.05 power ( 1−β ) =80 % . For variability ( σ = SD ) , value 0.5 mm use , consider PPD change baseline three month main outcome variable , desire difference 1.8 mm . On basis data , number enrol patient conduct study calculate 12 patient per arm . However , consider possibility certain amount drop outpatient ( 10 % ) , total number request patient 14 per treatment group . Statistical method data select site process , patient consider statistical unit . The obtained clinical outcome variable calculate patient , treatment group . For evaluation intragroup change baseline 7 , 14 , within three month ANOVA test use ( normality distribution proven ) . Statistical significance define P &lt; 0.001 . All data analyze use software program ( SPSS 19 ) .</detailed_description>
