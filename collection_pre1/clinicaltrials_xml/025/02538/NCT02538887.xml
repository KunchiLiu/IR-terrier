	<detailed_description>This study propose evaluate FDA-approved Radio Frequency Surgical Detection System ( RFDS ) non-radiological mean ease process detect retain sponge reconcile sponge count labor delivery room ( follow vaginal birth ) . It would replace current standard-of-care safety mechanism already place study site prevent retain sponge . All safeguard remain enforced : counting , visual inspection , x-rays indicated standard protocol . The system study involves surgeon scan subject 's vaginal area use spherical device place 1cm symphysis pubis . This static scan serve detect retain cotton texiles within vaginal cavity birth . This Verisphere , reusable device , encase sterile sheath use . It come direct contact subject 's vagina , hovers pelvic/vaginal region . If radio-frequency tag sponge remain inside subject , signal alert surgical team remove . The visible console display confirmation code scan complete . This confirmation code keep part medical record absence retain textile confirm . Once provider assure retained item , device may use scan trash receptacle locate miss textile pre- post-delivery sponge/guauze count remain incongruent . This alleviate need assistant personnel manually `` dig '' soil material sponge localization .</detailed_description>
