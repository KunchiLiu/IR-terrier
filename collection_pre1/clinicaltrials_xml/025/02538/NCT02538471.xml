	<brief_summary>Patients metastatic breast cancer receive least one single agent chemotherapy demonstrate stable disease disease progression two consecutive clinical/radiological assessment ( interval least 2 week ) . Transforming growth factor-beta ( TGFΒ ) blockade enhance response irradiate tumor improve function Dendritic T cell . Patients receive 300 mg/day study drug administer via oral drug tablet every day 14 day 14 day ( =28 day cycle ) . Radiation metastatic site deliver dose 7.5 Gy , give consecutively day 1-3-5 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Transforming growth factor-beta ( TGFβ ) pleiotropic cytokine belongs superfamily ligand , include bone morphogenetic protein activins [ 1-5 ] . Under normal condition , member TGFβ family maintain homeostasis many organ system . In normal non-cancerous cell , TGFβ limit growth epithelial , endothelial , neuronal , hematopoietic cell lineages anti-proliferative apoptotic response . In addition , TGFβ exert potent effect influence immune function , cell proliferation/ functional differentiation , cell adhesion , extracellular matrix production , cell motility , angiogenesis , cytokine production . TGFβ implicate important factor growth , progression , metastatic potential advance cancer . Although TGFβ show suppress growth epithelial cell early stage tumor development ( premalignant condition ) , effect advance cancer complex [ 1 , 5-6 ] . Increased production TGFβ find many neoplasm breast , prostate , gastric , renal , epidermal carcinoma , elevate plasma TGFβ level patient correlate advanced disease , metastasis , low survival rate [ 7-13 ] . In late stage cancer , TGFβ induce growth suppression lose , instead , TGFβ promote tumor growth metastasis . Eli Lilly develop produce Transforming Growth Factor-beta ( TGF-β ) receptor type-1 kinase inhibitor . LY2157299 monohydrate ( LY2157299 ) small molecule inhibits TGF-β receptor type 1 kinase activity . LY2157299 develop investigate activity patient glioblastoma TGF-β demonstrate play specific role tumor progression . In addition , LY2157299 investigate patient population , either stand-alone therapy combination standard anti-tumor treatment regimen indication include hepatocellular carcinoma pancreatic cancer . Future investigation include indication likely TGF-β associate pathway activation , melanoma , breast prostate cancer well hematologic malignancy .</detailed_description>
