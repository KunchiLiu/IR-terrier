	<detailed_description>During screen session participant provide buccal swab genetics test , preliminary data show effect cocaine doxazosin impact significantly genotype ADRA1A , CC genotype respond robustly cocaine doxazosin whereas CT genotype . Participants enrol regardless genotype , though investigator plan retrospectively exclude rare TT genotype . During screening , investigator collect participant ' demographic medical history , conduct physical exam , record ECG . A trained assistant administer MINI collect diagnostic data . The investigator draw blood CBC comprehensive metabolic panel include electrolyte , liver function test ( total bilirubin , ALT , AST , alkaline phosphatase ) renal function test ( creatinine BUN ) . All applicant study participation receive counsel part participation , advise treatment drug abuse indicate available . Applicants participate study receive treatment referral information appropriate . At completion participation , study subject advise treatment indicate available , give treatment referral information assistance . General Procedures Participants report research common three-times-weekly 11 day doxazosin titration period . They allow miss 3 visit discontinue miss 3 visit . At initial screen visit , restriction use alcohol , drug abuse , medication review . All subject require sign write statement abstain psychostimulants throughout duration participation trial . After determine volunteer meet inclusion exclusion criterion , participant receive screen dos cocaine ( 0 , 20 , 40 mg , IV , constrain 20 mg precedes 40 mg ) . To retain study participant must report change rating `` high '' least 20 point follow 40 mg dose . Remaining participant randomize two treatment group ( placebo doxazosin 8 mg/d ) . Doxazosin titrate target dose 11 day minimize side-effects . Participants complete doxazosin titration phase study outpatient doxazosin alone know safe combine cocaine . Participants report research common every 4 day . The titration schedule attach Table 2 . The investigator use standard riboflavin label monitor treatment adherence throughout study . Riboflavin ( 25mg ) encapsulate study medication adherence monitor measure riboflavin urine use quantitative fluorescence 39,40 . Because riboflavin contain many vitamin preparation , positive riboflavin test may truly reflect adherence study medication treatment . To confirm adherence , investigator add 15 mg acetazolamide ( ACZ ) doxazosin capsule . ACZ include doxazosin study medication begin study day 6 capsule contain ACZ substitute . The team continue monitor urine several day day 6 characterize long take ACZ become undetectable . Participants must test cocaine negative day 1 discontinue study , though may reenter late investigator agree . After dose titration investigator initiate treatment target dos study medication . As show Table 3 ( attach ) , participant remain original doxazosin treatment group duration study ( two group list emphasize point ) . Participants complete non-contingent cocaine dose cocaine self-administration procedure three time , treatment dose modafinil . Non-contingent dose self-administration do day , non-contingent dose occur self-administration pm . One treatment order illustrate ( 0 , 200 , 300 mg/d ) , practice order participant receive three modafinil dos ( placebo , 200 mg/d , 300 mg/d ) randomize . Participants follow outpatient study . They report clinic every 4 day show Table 3 observe dose urine test adherence monitoring . Participants must test cocaine-negative day 1 , 4 , 9 , 14 remain study . This participant enrol study admit research common unknown amount cocaine body . Participants take three capsule daily 7:00 . The capsule contain placebo , doxazosin 8 mg , modafinil 200 300 mg , depend randomization group modafinil dose . On 4th day study medication treatment admit research common ensure procedure follow day occur fairly standard condition . On 5th day study medication treatment receive non-contingent dos cocaine participate cocaine self-administration session . After complete study activity , modafinil discontinue modafinil wash-out period 4 day time continue take assign dose doxazosin . They complete study procedure treatment next assign modafinil dose . This repeat participant complete study three time , modafinil dose . As noted , participant remain original doxazosin treatment group participant continue receive assign doxazosin dose throughout study . Daily activity non-contingent cocaine dosing day show Table 4 daily activity cocaine self-administration day show Table 5 ( see section S table ) . Non-contingent dos cocaine ( placebo , 20 , 40 mg , IV ) administer hourly interval random order . The following day two self-administration session . In one session dose placebo saline available another session dose 20 mg cocaine available order counterbalance across participant . At begin session participant receive sample drug available session , saline cocaine . The make series 10 choice receive drug available session monetary alternative increase value . The value money choice increase 10 choice : $ .05 , $ .05 , $ .05 , $ .05 , $ 1 , $ 4 , $ 7 , $ 10 , $ 13 , $ 16 . Choices occur 15 min interval . The investigator previously find arrangement produce choice behavior reflect magnitude reinforce effect sensitive pharmacologic manipulation . Criteria Withholding Cocaine Cocaine administer behavioral manifestation cocaine toxicity ( agitation , psychosis , inability cooperate study procedure ) , though observe small dos cocaine administer human laboratory study . To ensure subject risk cocaine , rest pulse must less 90 bpm blood pressure must less 150 mmHg systolic le 90 mmHg diastolic . Criteria Participant Discontinuation : 1 . Positive urine drug screen breath test indicate illicit use abuse drug deliver part protocol 2 . Inability comply study procedures 3 . Have exaggerate response cocaine ( 5 min systolic BP great 180 mmHg , diastolic BP great 120 mmHg , heart rate great [ ( 220 - age ) × 0.85 ] bpm ) . Cocaine Administration Medical Monitoring Participants remain seated experimental session except brief visit lavatory . An IV place cocaine dosing . On day involve non-contingent cocaine dosing , first confirm vital sign within allow limit , physician administer solution slow IV push . An ACLS-certified physician present 15 min drug administration least 1 hour drug administration . The physician available house pager least 4 hour drug administration . Heart rate measure use continuous ECG 15 min prior cocaine placebo dose 1 hour dosing . Blood pressure assess frequent interval 15 min prior cocaine placebo dose assessment 1 hour dose baseline level reach . On day involve choice session , IV place patient-controlled analgesia ( PCA ) pump load saline 20mg cocaine dos depend session . Participants receive one non-contingent sample dose drug available session . Participants 10 opportunity choose receive repeat dos drug available session ( sample dose ) receive monetary alternative increase value ( $ .05 , $ .05 , $ .05 , $ .05 , $ 1 , $ 4 , $ 7 , $ 10 , $ 13 , $ 16 ) . Choices begin 15 min sample dose subsequent choice available 15 min interval . Cocaine dose delay necessary due elevate cardiovascular index base stop criterion . Investigators select 15 min inter-dose interval use self-administration session base publish data show arrangement safe yield interpretable data 44 . Heart rate monitor continuously blood pressure measure prior dose 15 min interval 45 min final cocaine dose . The physician halt cocaine administration stop criterion meet . Assessments Substance Use Inventory ( SUI ) . This instrument collect data type , frequency , amount drug use , well rout administration . Participants complete measure screen inpatient episode . DSM-IV Diagnosis . The MINI administer initial screening serf determine whether participant meet DSM-IV criterion drug dependence rule major psychiatric disorder ( e.g. , affective disorder , schizophrenia ) . Data SUI use augment ability MINI determine participant meet inclusion criterion . Beck Depression Inventory II ( BDI-II ) . The BDI-II third-generation BDI , revise 1996 , base original . The instrument retain original 21-item questionnaire format require approximately 10 min complete . This indicator use trial monitor participant ' mood study , make also measure participant ' safety . Participants complete measure screen daily inpatient episode . Visual Analogue Scales ( VAS ) . Subjective effect produce cocaine placebo measure use VAS consist continuous 10-cm line mark 0 100 . Participants required rate drug craving , dysphoria , euphoria scale 0 100 . Ratings include `` High , '' `` Good Effects , '' `` Bad Effects , '' `` Like Drug , '' `` Dislike Drug , '' `` Crave Cocaine , '' `` Likely Use Cocaine Available '' , `` Desire Cocaine .
