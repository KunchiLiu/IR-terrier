	<brief_title>Acute Chest Pain Imaging ED With Combine CCTA CT Perfusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE : Due subjectivity clinical symptom indirect nature establish ischemia test , effective initial triage patient ED acute new onset chest pain difficult lead high number patient admit hospital despite obstructive coronary disease . In subsequent work , patient require extensive testing significant resource consumption sometimes delay treatment . The ability obtain information presence coronary artery stenoses plaque early noninvasive fashion could substantially enhance initial triage ED patient . A combined approach propose use CT coronary angiography ass coronary morphology together CT myocardial perfusion assessment would address morphology function help correctly characterize coronary lesion decision make potential coronary intervention . Coronary CTA Analysis : MDCT data set assess qualitatively presence coronary disease within coronary segment , include side branch . The assessment perform original axial source image ; thin slice ( 5mm ) MIP 's MPR reconstruction orthogonal perpendicular vessel centerline , short axis cross-sectional reconstruction ( 0.625-mm-thickness ) . The analysis perform per segment per patient . CT Myocardial Perfusion Analysis : The initial evaluation perfusion perform reconstruction short axis image view thick multiplanar reformation ( MPR ) slice thickness 5mm 10mm . Increasing slice thickness increase voxel size thus decrease image noise improve low contrast resolution . For scan increase image noise , smooth reconstruction algorithm also useful . A true perfusion defect persist throughout multiple different phase visualize systole diastole . On hand , potential defect present one phase ( i.e . systole ) disappear likely represent artifact due motion ( e.g . false positive ) . In order identify region myocardium minor discrepancy tissue density , narrow window width prefer , high contrast achieve . Measuring attenuation value first pass compute tomography ( CT ) perfusion image helpful identify perfusion defect ( HU ~ 50 ) vs. normal ( remote ) myocardium ( Hounsfield Units ( HU ) ~ 100 ) . A 17-segment model define American College Cardiology ( ACC ) / American Heart Association ( AHA ) use determine perfusion defect particular myocardial segment coronary artery distribution . A score scale 0-4 grade myocardial segment depend extent area perfusion defect within segment . The sum segment score use determine patient disease ( e.g. , maximum score attainable 68 , sum score &gt; 3 correlate 5 % volume ischemia myocardium designate disease patient level . ) - Decision CT myocardial Perfusion make cardiac radiologist acquisition calcium score identify moderate stenosis non-evaluable segment describe protocol . - The result coronary CT angiography CT myocardial Perfusion use together make decision whether send patient home cath . Patients admit cardiac investigation : stenosis &gt; 70 % Coronary CT angiography intermediate stenosis ( 50-70 % ) /non-diagnostic rest coronary CT angiography CT myocardial perfusion defect . Patients consider negative exclude acute coronary syndrome stenosis coronary CT angiography &lt; 50 % intermediate/non-diagnostic lesion see myocardial ischemia present CT myocardial Perfusion . Study Objective The main purpose study definite ED chest pain admission triage , help reduce length stay direct patient cost . This approach reduce economic burden intermediate risk group patient well . Study Hypotheses The propose study seek evaluate follow hypothesis : I- The combined evaluation CT angiography CT myocardial perfusion efficient correctly diagnose obstructive disease . This reduce length hospital stay ( LOS ) , assessment intermediate risk patient detect exclude acute coronary syndrome , patient present chest pain ED compare strategy SPECT alone . II- To reduce direct patient care cost patient population . This study propose new chest pain algorithm arm-B West Kendall Baptist hospital ( combine approach CT angiography CT myocardial perfusion ) reduce length stay well consumed resource comparison current approach . The additional value CT myocardial perfusion avoid false positive result CT angiography alone . CT myocardial perfusion also provide incremental diagnostic value CT angiography . STUDY DESIGN This prospective open label two-arm clinical trial . Arm-A patient receive standard care diagnostic test Baptist Hospital , include SPECT imaging , Arm-B patient randomize sequentially two group ; Group-1 receive CT Angiography CT myocardial perfusion new Revolution CT scanner ( General Electric Healthcare ) Group-2 receive SPECT image test ; group ARM-B West Kendall Baptist Hospital . The study population include total 250 patient present ED episode new onset chest pain . Both study arm use 5-Level Miami Baptist Chest Pain Protocol triage ED . This chest pain protocol use previously publish Baptist Hospital patient triaged serve reference population ( n=50 ) , patient ( n=100 ) present West Kendall Baptist Hospital triaged use modify chest pain protocol include coronary CT angiography CT myocardial perfusion assessment protocol Level 3 ( select level 4 ) instead SPECT ( Group-1 ) patient ( n=100 ) West Kendall Baptist Hospital receive SPECT image test ( Group-2 ) . The group doctor provide interpretation arm SPECT image . All CT scan data ( include SPECT imaging , CT Angiography , CT myocardial perfusion ) transfer PACS , system store data electronically accessed Radiologist . The Radiologist blind research patient data . The study coordinator collect study data include ; patient length stay , direct cost CT scan data relate chest pain episode . Those patient discharge ED contact telephone call 30 day follow-up MACE event . In case patient available source contact information , medical record check primary care doctor contact . STUDY PROCEDURES Patient screen occur time patient present ED either hospital assign categorize level base 5-Level Miami Baptist Chest Pain Protocol . Patients assign `` Level 3 Level 4 '' , meet inclusion none exclusion criterion , invite participate study . Informed Consent Once Investigator study coordinator determine patient 's eligibility study , background propose study , benefit risk procedure explain patient . All potential patient must agree sign inform consent document prior perform study-specific procedure include pre-medications . Patients enrol Baptist Hospital treat accord current standard care practice . They ask consent simply accord privacy law allow use data scientific evaluation . Patients enrol West Kendall Baptist Hospital consent treat accord modify 5-Level Miami Baptist Chest Pain Protocol , SPECT nuclear perfusion scan replace coronary CT angiography CT myocardial perfusion study Level 3 patient , CT myocardial perfusion study add Level 4 patient , intermediate stenosis ( 40-70 % ) , Agatston Calcium Score &gt; 400 , non-evaluable segment CT angiography due calcification , motion artifact , technical reason . Patient ARM-B randomize sequentially divide two group ; group-1 receive CT Angiography CT myocardial perfusion group-2 receive SPECT image test . Patients West Kendall Baptist Hospital provide consent share de-identified data General Electric Healthcare scientific evaluation , product development , potential marketing use . Only West Kendall Baptist hospital revolution study data share General Electric Healthcare . DATA MANAGEMENT AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS : All eligible patient assign study ID personal information strictly keep confidential . All data collect analyzed research purpose . The General Electric heath care access West Kendall Arm Revolution Computed tomography patient de-identified data . For statistical analysis , investigator interim analysis enrollment follow-up call complete . A biostatistician independently analyze data protocol . SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS : The experience undergoing compute tomography uncomfortable . Computed tomography scan result measurable radiation exposure . Volume coverage whole heart axial mode result effective radiation dose approximately 1 10 mSv , comparable standard chest multi-detector compute tomography ( MDCT ) exam ( typically 8 10 mSv ) nuclear perfusion stress image . MDCT require injection iodinate contrast agent . This , general , pose risk renal dysfunction contrast allergy . The dose contrast lower majority conventional contrast-enhanced compute tomography study adequate measure take identify patient know contrast allergy renal dysfunction exclude participation study . Administration Metoprolol ( heart beat lower medication ) might lower blood pressure cause dizziness well bronchospasm allergic reaction . In case , physician provide adequate treatment . Patients known contraindication allergy Metoprolol enrol . The common side effect Regadenoson shortness breath , headache , flushing , chest discomfort chest pain , dizziness , nausea , abdominal discomfort , metallic taste mouth , feel hot .
