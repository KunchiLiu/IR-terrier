	<brief_summary>Bladder cancer well-recognized complication spinal cord injury ( SCI ) individual . The observed incidence rate SCI individual considerably high compare general population . Bladder cancer SCI individual tend present earlier age compare general population . Furthermore , bladder cancer SCI individual commonly invasive advanced stage time diagnosis compare bladder cancer general population . Individuals bladder cancer commonly present hematuria urinary symptom . The gold standard diagnosis cystoscopy . However SCI individual , hematuria may get attributed catheter irritation trauma urinary tract infection . Furthermore , bladder wall commonly present various change cystoscopic examination mask presence bladder wall mass . Thus , diagnosis bladder cancer SCI individual complicate . Some cytokeratins frequently overexpressed tumor cell therefore marker bladder cancer . There new commercial test available quantitative measurement cytokeratins . The diagnostic accuracy test investigate non-SCI individual symptom suspicious bladder cancer . The test show high sensitivity specificity value thus promise diagnostic screening tool . However , diagnostic accuracy test yet investigate SCI individual . The primary objective propose study investigate whether urine cytokeratin level spinal cord injury individual symptoms finding suspicious bladder cancer discriminator individual suffer bladder cancer suffer cancer . Individuals present symptom suspicious bladder cancer undergo ultrasonic cystoscopic examination bladder . An urine sample take , bladder flush collect bladder fluid sample . In patient bladder wall finding suspicious cancer , bladder wall biopsy take , accord clinical standard practice . The bladder fluid bladder wall biopsy submit cytology histopathology examination , respectively . Cytokeratin level measure urine sample .</brief_summary>
