	<detailed_description>Purpose Very large bile duct stone difficult remove.Dilation-assisted stone extraction , also term small endoscopic sphincterotomy plus endoscopic papillary large balloon dilatation , safe effective technique treatment large CBD stones.However , approximately 5-10 % patient , removal large bile duct stone may difficult . For select group patient conventional endoscopic stone treatment device fail , laser lithotripsy technology provide approach fragmentation difficult bile duct stone . A single-operator cholangioscopy ( SOC ) system ( SpyGlass Direct Visualization System , Boston Scientific Corp. , Natick , MA , USA ) overcome conventional cholangioscopy limitations.We aim evaluate efficacy safety Spyglass-guided laser lithotripsy difficult CBD stone amenable conventional dilation-assisted stone extraction therapy . Study Type : Interventional Study Design : Allocation : Randomized Endpoint Classification : Safety/Efficacy Study Intervention Model : Parallel Assignment Masking : Single Blind ( Subject ) Primary Purpose : Treatment Official Title : Randomized Trial Spyglass Guided Laser Lithotripsy Versus Dilation-Assisted Stone Extraction Endoscopic Removal Difficult Large Bile Duct Stones Primary Outcome Measures : • Bile Duct Stone Clearance Confirmation stone remain bile duct patient cholangiography . Additionally , serum laboratory abnormality AST , ALT , Alkaline Phophatase , bilirubin , epigastric abdominal pain attributable bile duct stone . Secondary Outcome Measures : - Number ERCP - The number ERCP procedure require complete clearance bile duct stone . - Total Procedure Time - The total time minute ERCP procedure require stone removal . - Estimated Procedure Cost - The cost patient management bile duct stone base cost procedure , hospitalization , associate cost complication cholangitis , pancreatitis , perforation , bleed . - Cholangitis Cholangitis ERCP procedure define presentation epigastric abdominal pain , temperature great 38.5 Celsius accompany either laboratory abnormality AST , ALT , Alkaline Phosphatase , Bilirubin abnormal image biliary tree ultrasound , compute tomography scan , magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography . - Pancreatitis - Pancreatitis follow ERCP procedure define onset epigastric abdominal pain either amylase lipase great 3 time upper limit normal finding ultrasound , compute tomography scan , magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography suggestive pancreatic inflammation . - Bleeding - Bleeding attributable stone therapy define drop hemoglobin 1 gm/dl follow ERCP procedure cause identify standard clinical evaluation . Eligibility Ages Eligible Study : 18 Years old Genders Eligible Study : Both Accepts Healthy Volunteers : No Criteria Inclusion Criteria : • Bile duct stone &gt; 1.5cm demonstrate ultrasound , compute tomography , magnetic resonance image Exclusion Criteria : - Biliary , gallbladder pancreatic malignancy - Pregnant - Prior biliary diversion surgery - Under age 18 - Unable give inform consent</detailed_description>
