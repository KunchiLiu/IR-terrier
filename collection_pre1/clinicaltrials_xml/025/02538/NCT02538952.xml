	<detailed_description>Background : In Botswana , rest sub-Saharan Africa , undiagnosed tuberculosis ( TB ) TB diagnose late course disease think common cause death among HIV-infected person receive antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) well yet ART . Common reason failure diagnose TB early , include : ( 1 ) failure appropriately screen HIV-infected patient TB ; ( 2 ) difficulty diagnose TB traditional diagnostic method . Public Health Intervention : The recent development Xpert MTB/RIF assay GeneXpert platform ( Xpert ) revolutionize TB diagnostic capability clinician manage HIV-infected patient . Among HIV-infected adult , TB diagnostic sensitivity Xpert ( 82.4 % ) proven superior smear microscopy ( 44.6 % ) . In line World Health organization ( WHO ) guideline , Botswana Ministry Health ( MOH ) United States Centers Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ) , initiate project July 2012 rapidly rollout 13 Xpert device service 22 HIV care treatment clinic simultaneously initiate evaluation answer important operational research question inform future national scale-up . To maximize impact Xpert device improve detection active TB , Xpert rollout precede strengthen TB screen procedure : ( 1 ) ensure 22 HIV care treatment clinic adopt WHO-recommended four-symptom TB screen adult ; ( 2 ) situating trained TB case-finding nurse 22 facility ; ( 3 ) training health facility personnel smear-microscopy-based Xpert-based TB diagnostic algorithm . The combination strengthen TB screen procedure rollout Xpert device refer `` Xpert package '' proposal . Key Evaluation Objectives : The evaluation component project two key objective : ( 1 ) evaluate whether new MOH-recommended Xpert-based pulmonary TB diagnostic algorithm ( include Xpert test sputum sample TB suspect chest x-ray Xpert-negative TB suspect ) sensitive pre-Xpert smear-microscopy-based algorithm ( smear microscopy chest x-ray smear-negative TB suspect ) diagnose culture-positive TB disease ; ( 2 ) evaluate impact whole `` Xpert package '' all-cause mortality first six month ART , among adult patient . Rationale First Evaluation Objective : Although expect Xpert-based TB diagnostic algorithm sensitive specific pre-Xpert algorithm , superiority Xpert- microscopy-based algorithm Botswana yet evaluate . Rationale Second Evaluation Objective : In Botswana , undiagnosed TB TB diagnose late course disease think common cause death among HIV-infected person receive antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) . The Xpert package could conceivably reduce TB-related mortality ensure patient screen TB ensure TB suspect access sensitive TB test ( Xpert ) . Since start Botswana step wedge trial 2012 , two separate relate randomized trial Africa , TB-NEAT study XTEND trial , fall short demonstrate association use Xpert patient symptom TB reduce TB mortality . However , limitation trial mean question whether Xpert reduce early ART mortality definitively answer . Design : Because Xpert package expect beneficial effect patient enrol 22 study clinic , phase rollout Xpert device use step wedge design chosen . Prior Xpert device rollout , 22 facility initiate intensified TB screening procedure simultaneously . Subsequently , 13 Xpert device activate step-wise manner nine month either one two Xpert device activate per month order Xpert device rollout randomly assign . This step-wedge design involve enrollment three cohort : 1 . Prospective cohort A ( enrol pre-Xpert device rollout ) : All patient attend one 22 HIV clinic first time study start ( July 31 , 2012 ) , Xpert device rollout , eligible cohort . 2 . Prospective cohort B ( enrol post-Xpert device rollout ) : All patient attend one 22 HIV clinic first time Xpert device rollout eligible cohort . 3 . Retrospective cohort : All patient initiate ART one 22 HIV clinic first time 24 month study start . To answer first primary study question , sensitivity pre- Xpert TB diagnostic algorithm prospective cohort A compare post- Xpert algorithm sensitivity prospective cohort B . To answer second primary study question , investigator compare 6-month ART mortality rate ART enrollee retrospective cohort 6-month ART mortality rate prospective cohort B . Power Answer First Primary Study Question : Fisher 's Exact Test sample size formula compare two proportion Proc Power feature SAS version 9.2. software , use estimate study power . Power estimate adjust expected design effect account intra-cluster correlation . For design effect calculation , intra-class correlation 0.05 assume . With anticipated sample size 6,136 prospective enrollee ( 1,878 pre-Xpert 4,258 post-Xpert ) , study estimate &gt; 80 % power detect pre- versus post-Xpert TB diagnostic sensitivity , assume culture-positive TB prevalence 4 % among prospective cohort enrollee , pre-Xpert sensitivity ≤52.5 % post-Xpert sensitivity ≥82.5 % . Power Answer Second Primary Study Question : As August 2015 , 10,131 ART patient medical record abstract retrospective cohort . Published literature suggest pre-Xpert 6-month ART mortality rate 15 per 100 person year ( PY ) . Using publish cluster randomize trial ( CRT ) power formula adapt step wedge trial anticipate study sample size , study &gt; 80 % power detect difference 6-month all-cause ART mortality cohort R B 50 % cohort R mortality ≥6/100 PY 40 % cohort R mortality ≥13/100 PY . Procedures : All 22 health facility assess prior train troubleshoot potential logistical barrier successful study implementation . All personnel involve study procedure train study start closely supervised implementation . Patients enrol prospective cohort follow six month HIV clinic enrollment , end TB treatment , whichever later . Tracing ART patient retrospective prospective cohort , document late appointment lose follow-up ( miss last scheduled appointment &gt; 60 day ) perform accord national guideline facilitate estimation true 6-month ART mortality . Time line : Prospective cohort enrollment start July 2012 complete March 2014 . Retrospective cohort enrollment complete March 2015 . Patient follow-up data entry complete March 2016 time analysis answer first two primary study question possible .</detailed_description>
