	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab Vorinostat Treating Patients With Recurrent Squamous Cell Head Neck Cancer Salivary Gland Cancer That Is Metastatic and/or Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine safety tolerability MK-3475 ( pembrolizumab ) combination vorinostat patient recurrent metastatic head neck squamous cell carcinoma ( RMHNSCC ) recurrent metastatic salivary gland cancer ( RMSGC ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine objective response rate disease control rate combination MK-3475 vorinostat patient RMHNSCC RMSGC . II . Examine program cell death ligand 1 ( PD-L1 ) expression T cell phenotype archive tumor , on-treatment tumor biopsy , pre- post-treatment blood sample correlate clinical response drug combination . III . Determine median overall survival progression free survival RMHNSCC RMSGC patient enrol study . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Explore peripheral T cell phenotype baseline 3 cycle vorinostat MK-3475 . II . Measure expression proteins PD-1 family baseline tumor sample treatment biopsy . OUTLINE : Patients receive vorinostat orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) via percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy ( PEG ) day 1-5 pembrolizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day 2 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day every 8-12 week thereafter .</detailed_description>
