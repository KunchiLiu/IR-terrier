	<brief_title>TVT Versus Bulkamid®-Injections Treatment Stress Urinary Incontinence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Background One three adult female suffer daily urinary incontinence . Two third urinary incontinence physical activity-related stress urinary incontinence ( SUI ) . If first-line treatment SUI , train pelvic floor muscle , insufficient , treatment option suburethral sling operation transurethral bulking injection . Tension-free Vaginal Tape ( TVT ) consider gold standard treatment SUI1 . TVT operation effective treatment efficacy high 90 % . TVT perform experienced operator carry low risk serious complication . Following complication rate report TVT : bladder perforation 3,8 % , urinary tract infection 4,1 % , complication require laparotomy 3,4 % , complete postoperative urinary retention 2,3 % minor voiding difficulty 7,6 % . All complication side effect occur 20 - 30 % patient . Long-term effect TVT still unclear complication vaginal erosion urinary tract protrusion tape concern . Bulking agent create artificial mass urethral submucosa accord hypothesis improve urethral coaptation restore continence especially abdominal pressure increase . It also suggest midurethral injection therapy may increase central filler volume consequently increase power urethral sphincter . Several different agent use periurethral transurethral injection , e.g . collagen , ethylene vinyl alcohol , hyaluronic acid polyacrylamide hydrogel ( PAHG ) . However , agent abandon due safety issue . In Nordic country Polyacrylamide hydrogel ( PAHG ) nowadays use urethral injection . PAHG biocompatible , non-biodegradable , non-allergenic , non-migrational , atoxic , stable , sterile . Urethral bulk therapy minimally invasive nature treatment n't require hospitalization . Procedure perform local anaesthesia . The efficacy PAHG-injections treating stress urinary incontinence vary 64 % 74 % depend treated patient group . Urethral injection low risk complication TVT-operation PAHG show low risk serious adverse event . Bulking therapy negative effect term possible subsequent midurethral sling operation . Cochrane review urethral injection therapy conclude injection therapy inferior surgery 1-year follow-up well safety profile . However , objective outcome effect treatment necessarily equal patient satisfaction improvement quality life ( QOL ) . A study Corcos et al . compare surgery collagen injection treatment SUI show significantly well outcome 24-hour pad test woman treat surgery compare treat collagen injection difference patient satisfaction QOL 12 month two group . Number severity complication much great surgery group . A questionnaire study assess treatment acceptability treatment expectation woman low urinary tract symptom , show patient general preference less invasive therapy even cost low success rate . 2 . Hypothesis aim study Randomized study compare urethral injection treatment TVT miss . There significant difference patient satisfaction urethral injection collagen surgery . Surgical group study consist treatment sling operation , Burch procedure needle bladder neck suspension . While comparative study TVT Bulkamid® , knowledge cost-effectiveness patient satisfaction miss . This prospective randomized study compare TVT Bulkamid®-injections treatment SUI . 3 . Materials method Subjects include study woman suffer stress urinary incontinence non-conservative treatment plan . They willing participate study . Patients give oral write information study randomize two group undergo either TVT-Exact® Bulkamid® . Study Flow : 1 . Randomization treatment 2 . Treatment ( Bulkamid TVT exact ) 3 . Phone call contact 1 month 4 . Second Bulkamid-treatment necessary within 3 month first treatment 5 . 3 month follow-up visit decision secondary treatment necessary 6 . ( Secondary ) TVT treatment least 3 month follow-up visit ( Bulkamid treatment follow primary TVT-treatment ) 7 . One-year follow-up visit decision treatment necessary ( re-Bulkamid/TVT ? ) 8 . Questionnaires 2,3 4-years treatment , mail contact 9 . 5-year follow-up visit Examinations treatment : - 2-3 day micturition diary standardise questionnaire form assess symptom distress ( UDI-6 , IIQ-7 ) impact urinary incontinence quality life sexual function ( RAND-36 , PISQ-12 ) - Patient 's estimation distress cause SUI ( VAS scale 0= distress 10= much distress ) - Exclusion urinary tract infection ( sample 2-3 week treatment ) - Physical examination : cough stress test PVR measurement ultrasound , exclusion pelvic organ prolapse large uterine myoma - Urodynamics , need confirm diagnosis - A stress pad test describe Svenningsen et al.20 ( Pad weigh 20 jump jack spot three forceful cough stand position 300 ml bladder volume . To woman unable perform test modify version 10 cough stand position ) . Examinations treatment : - Post-void residual urine volume ( &lt; 150ml patient discharge ) - Pain VAS scale ( 0=no pain 10= bad possible pain patient imagine ) - Question : would patient recommend treatment good friend ? - Was pain treatment : patient expect , less , bad ? Examinations follow-up visit ( 3 month , 1 year , 5 year ) : - Gynecological examination ( ultrasound ) - Cough stress test 200 250 fill bladder - Stress PAD test describe earlier - PVR measurement - Exclusion urinary tract treatment patient fail response symptom infection - Questionnaires ( RAND-36 , UDI 6 , IIQ-7 ) - Pain VAS scale - Satisfaction treatment VAS scale - Question : would patient recommend treatment good friend ? - The length sick-leave operation , possible visit health care provider - Analysis efficacy treatment stress urinary incontinence category : fully recover , partly recover , change , bad symptom , answer . The surgeon , performed procedure , perform follow-up visits.Questionnaires ( RAND 36 , UDI-6 , IIQ-7 , PISQ-12 ) collect patient two four year treatment via mail . Also mention analysis efficacy treatment question possible incontinence collect . The analysis possible adverse event ( complication ) treatment perform operation whole follow-up time . The adverse effect categorize related treatment , possibly relate treatment relate treatment . TVT treatment TVT perform local anesthesia ( 70 - 100 ml 0.25 % prilocain cum epinephrine ) i.v . pain medication phentanyl two dose request . Operation perform TVT-Exact® kit . Operation perform policlinically operation theatre depend patient 's medical condition . Cystoscopy perform set tape . A cough stress test 250 300 ml bladder fulfillment show right tension tape . Before operation prophylactic antibiotic Cefuroxime 1.5 g i.v give ( Dalacin 900 mg i.v case allergy penicillin ) . The patient go home 2 4 hour follow-up , PVR 150 ml . A sick leave 5 day recommend . All used medication , duration treatment , follow-up time time patient leave hospital write well onset urination . Pain asked VAS scale 0 10 ( maximal total VAS ) patient 's asked describe , whether pain treatment expected/less/more . Bulkamid®- injection Urethral injection perform policlinically local anesthesia ( 10 ml lidocain , two injection side urethra ) . The Bulkamid-injections transurethral four injection ( 0.2 - 1ml ) location `` ten , two five seven o'clock '' within 0.5 1 cm bladder - urethra junction . Additional injection avoid inject first injection fail . After operation patient urinate empty bladder . The PVR check treatment ultrasound simultaneously evaluation stability Bulkamid-injections . The treatment photograph still picture late evaluation . All used medication , duration treatment , follow-up time time patient leave hospital write well onset urination . Pain asked VAS scale 0 10 ( maximal total VAS ) patient 's asked describe , whether pain treatment expected/less/more . If give treatment fail treat stress urinary incontinence stress urinary incontinence return , TVT- Bulkamid®-operation ( re- ) perform follow-up visit . The primary treatment one Bulkamid®-injection secondary injection follow-up visit . Bulkamid® injection interfere subsequent TVT operation vice versa . Re-injections Bulkamid do basis `` filling gap '' primary treatment . In word do accord situation see second treatment . The treatment photograph ( still picture ) . Sample size The study conduct non-inferiority trial base patient satisfaction rate . The patient satisfaction rate VAS scale ≥80 assume 80 % 75 % TVT- Bulkamid-patients . If true difference favour standard treatment 5 % , 192 patient ( 96 per group ) require 80 % sure upper limit one-sided 95 % confidence interval exclude difference favour standard group 20 % . A 10 % dropout rate assume 212 woman plan randomize ( 1:1 ) study . Randomization number The randomization number generate onset study seal opaque envelope . Randomization perform use computer-assisted random block system ( R Development Core Team , 2006 , Greg Snow , 2006 ) permute randomization random block clinical trial . Random block 4 6 woman use . Altogether 250 random number generate . Time schedule The enrollment patient do within end year 2017 . Primary follow-up reporting first outcomes happen within 2018 . Ethical reason The effectiveness complication operation stress urinary incontinence show , randomize comparison TVT urethral injection miss . Therefore study need . This study also provide information cost-effectiveness patient satisfaction treatment . This comparison effective TVT operation high risk complication probably less effective , safe Bulkamid®- injection . TVT operation perform Bulkamid® treatment Bulkamid® injection interfere subsequent TVT treatment .</detailed_description>
