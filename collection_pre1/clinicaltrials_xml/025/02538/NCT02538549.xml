	<brief_summary>Behavioral activation ( BA ) low cost , evidence-based intervention effective treat depression anxiety . We develop behavioural activation card game client receive treatment Crisis Team Traditional Case Management ( TCM ) Kingston , ON . The game design integrate behavioural activation tool daily life receive point completion Activity Challenge , divide 4 area ( ACE4 ) , goal receive maximum amount point timeframe study . Using Randomized Control Trial ( RCT ) design , participant ( n=40 ) assign one two group , intervention group receive ACE4 treatment usual ( TAU ) control group receive TAU . Assessments carry upon entry study end intervention period ( 8 week ) . Assessments complete use WHODAS 2.0 ( World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule ) , HADS ( The Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale ) , CORE ( Clinical Outcome Routine Evaluation ) . We hypothesize treatment group receive ACE4 intervention show improvement overall mental state . Analyses conduct use SPSSv16 , analysis covariance t-test , binary logistic regression analysis use investigate factor predict good outcome . Results publish international journal present conference aim towards apply clinic Pakistan .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot RCT Test Effectiveness ACE4 ( Activity Challenge- 4 Areas ) Depression Anxiety</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION : Behavioral activation ( BA ) evidence base intervention find effective treating depression ( ref ) . It advantage low cost use people low literacy . BA easily deliver low middle income country like Pakistan , appropriately adapt . We develop single player card game base principle behavioral activation . The game use crisis transitional case management client , positive feedback . This pilot study use RCT design test effectiveness game . Objective To assess effectiveness ACE4 , depression care usual . Study design duration This study Randomized Controlled Trial ( RCT ) aim assess effectiveness ACE4 care usual depression . Study participant randomly assign two group intervention group receive ACE4 TAU , control group receive TAU . ACE4 : Introduction Intervention focus behavioral activation . Although ACE4 single player game , facilitate carer . The game come 15 card four colour , colour representative activity area ( example , Creative activity , recreational , self care work , social spiritual activity ) . The idea choose equal number activity colour . Every card number . Patients write number activity calendar come game , along time activity perform . The aim game score maximum point end 6 week . Those score high range get ACE4 badge ( addition get improvement mood ) Inclusion exclusion criterion All fulfill diagnostic criterion Depressive episode ( F32 ) Recurrent depressive disorder ( F33 except 33.4 ) use ICD10 RDC ( base interview use SCAN Urdu version ) , age 18 65 , score 8 HADS , Depression Subscale , approach . Patients ask attend appointment end study period assess . The exclusion criterion include ; excessive use alcohol drug ( use ICD 10 RDC alcohol drug abuse dependence ) significant cognitive impairment ( example learn disability dementia ) active psychosis . Procedure Patients refer study provide brief information study . Those meet criterion consent ask join study allocate one arm trial randomization . Sample size This feasibility study . We take 40 patient , 20 arm . Randomization Randomization perform distantly statistician , list patient accept group . After randomization patient allocate either treatment control arm . Randomization perform group separately . INSTRUMENTS The assessment carry base line end therapy ( 8 week ) . Control group receive care usual.A number equal intervention group employ group . Blind raters use assess change depression . The Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale ( HAD ) ( Zigmond Snaith , 1983 ) 14 item , self assessment scale design measure anxiety depression . It high internal consistency , face validity concurrent validity . Even-numbered question relate depression odd-numbered question relate anxiety . Each question 4 possible response . Responses score scale 3 0 . The maximum score therefore 21 depression 21 anxiety . A score 11 high indicates probable presence mood disorder score 8 10 suggestive presence respective state . The two subscales , anxiety depression , find independent measure . In current form HADS divide four range : normal ( 0-7 ) , mild ( 8-10 ) , moderate ( 11-15 ) severe ( 16-21 ) . The Clinical Outcome Routine Evaluatoin ( CORE ) client self-report questionnaire design administered therapy . The client ask respond 34 question feel last week , use 5-point scale range 'not ' 'most time ' . The 34 item measure cover four dimension : Subjective well-being , Problems/symptoms , Life function Risk/harm . The response design average practitioner produce mean score indicate level current psychological global distress ( 'healthy ' 'severe ' ) . The questionnaire repeat last session treatment ; comparison pre-and post-therapy score offer measure 'outcome ' ( i.e . whether client 's level distress change , much ) ( Evans , 2000 ) . Brief Disability Questionnaire ( BDQ ) develop WHO measure disability due physical psychological problem use extensively research ( Von Korff et al. , 1996 ) . A data form use collect information client . Study sit Crisis TCM service Kingston , ON , Canada . Data entry analysis Statistical analysis would carry use intention treat . Analyses carry use SPSS v16 . Both parametric non parametric test carry appropriate compare group . An analysis covariance use measure difference two group three time point , data normally distribute . A test use compare group , pair un-paired . SPSS frequency descriptive command use measure descriptive statistic . SPSS explore command use measure normality data , use histogram Kolmorogov Smirnov test . If therapy prove effective control , also use binary logistic regression analysis explore factor predict good outcome . An intention treat analysis perform . Number Needed Treat ( NNT ) calculate assist clinician clinical decision making . Research clinically naturalistic setting It recognize research likely provide result relevant routine clinical practice ; current study provide rigorous evaluation intervention provide current service Pakistan extra cost .</detailed_description>
