	<brief_title>Safety Effectiveness Study Live Zoster Vaccine Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor ( TNF ) Users ( VERVE )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Herpes zoster ( HZ ) , also know `` shingle '' , cause reactivation multiplication ubiquitous varicella zoster virus ( VZV ) remain latent everyone 's sensory neuron follow varicella , `` chickenpox '' . Among individual live age 85 , lifetime risk HZ 50 % , one five individual affect zoster develop post-herpetic neuralgia , result chronic pain . Other serious complication include encephalitis , permanent vision loss , rarely , dissemination death . Fortunately , live attenuate vaccine available reduce HZ risk 70 % . For patient rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) , vaccine great potential provide improve quality life reduce incidence complication associate zoster . Due underlying disease and/or treatment ( e.g . steroid ) rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) , risk herpes zoster RA patient approximately double general population . This increase risk make prevention zoster vaccination exceedingly important RA patient . In fact , high overall absolute risk zoster RA , vaccine yield comparable even great absolute risk reduction reduce risk shingle post-herpetic neuralgia RA population general population . However , use zoster vaccine RA patient low ( &lt; 5 % ) , less frequently use general population . National guideline Centers Disease Control Prevention 's ( CDC ) Advisory Committee Immunization Practices ( ACIP ) recommend single dose zoster vaccine individual age 60 old , vaccine recently gain FDA-approval administration person age 50 old . While large number RA patient would otherwise recommend receive vaccine basis age , theoretical safety concern relate vaccination likely explain low vaccination rate observe . Currently , Federal Drug Administration ( FDA ) , ACIP , American College Rheumatology ( ACR ) consider live zoster vaccine contraindicate patient receive immunosuppressive medication , biologic therapy . Such contraindication stem theoretical safety concern individual could develop varicella-like infection vaccine virus strain . However , investigator hypothesize vaccine safely give setting , publish data available suggest safety concern warrant . A grow body observational data suggest vaccinate RA patient receive biologic therapy vaccine may fact safe . Moreover , similarly little evidence , ACIP consider vaccine safe acceptable patient use methotrexate dos commonly use treat RA ( e.g . &lt; = 25 mg/week ) patient use glucocorticoid prednisone-equivalent dos ≤ 20 mg/day . In light 1 ) substantial elevate HZ risk among RA patient ; 2 ) national data show RA patient vaccinate HZ ; 3 ) high effectiveness vaccine general population , investigator propose conduct Varicella zostER VaccinE ( VERVE ) trial , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled study evaluate safety , tolerability , long-term effectiveness live herpes zoster vaccine . This pilot study recruit first 125 patient need 1,000 individual age 50 year older currently receive anti-TNF therapy RA inflammatory arthritis . Within relevant 6-week safety window , investigator collect serious adverse event ( satisfy regulatory definition SAE ) include non-serious event vaccine-strain varicella-like infection herpes zoster . Beyond key public health importance clinical question address , clinical trial methodological innovation anticipate unique large pragmatic trial . Additionally , investigator study vaccine tolerability long-term effectiveness linkage health plan data allow cost-effective follow-up minimizing participant study-site burden . Results pilot study facilitate parent trial change RA management demonstrate clinical safety immunogenicity live zoster vaccine among current anti-TNF user . Rheumatologists provider able improve care , outcomes , quality life RA patient , substantially decrease morbidity herpes zoster complication lifetime .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Must 50 year age old Must currently treat antiTNF therapy time study drug administration , allow small deviation dose frequency logistic feasibility ( e.g . study visit occur week day ) . Specifically , meet one following : Etanercept dose within 9 day ( 1 week + 2 day ) ; Adalimumab dose within 16 day ( 2 week + 2 day ) ; Certolizumab subcutaneous ( q2 week ) dose within 16 day ( 2 week + 2 day ) ; Certolizumab subcutaneous ( q4 week ) dose within 32 day ( 4 week + 4 day ) ; Golimumab subcutaneous ( q4 week ) dose within 32 day ( 4 week + 4 day ) ; Golimumab IV ( q8 week ) dose within 64 day ( 9 week + 1 day ) ; Infliximab IV ( q8 week ) dose within last 64 day ( 9 week + 1 day ) ; ( Date previous dose medication require ) Diagnosis RA another inflammatory arthritis ( Phase Ia ) ; RA , another inflammatory arthritis , inflammatory condition ( e.g . psoriasis ) require use antiTNF therapy ( Phase Ib II ) Phase I subject must test positive VZV immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) Subjects selfreported history prior varicella infection ( i.e . chicken pox ) longterm residence ( &gt; 30 year ) continental US . Phase Ia subject must receive oral systemic glucocorticoid within 30 day prior vaccination . Intraarticular glucocorticoid injection inhale glucocorticoid within previous 30 day acceptable . Subjects stable dos biologic nonbiologic DMARDs minimum 30 day prior vaccination . Eligible woman must postmenopausal ( &gt; 1 year since last menstrual period ) surgical history bilateral oophorectomy hysterectomy . Subjects ambulatory , community dwell capable give informed consent . Documented VZV negative result Prior use zoster vaccine ( Zostavax® , Merck ) Glucocorticoids prednisoneequivalent daily dose &gt; 10mg/day ( Phase 1b Phase II participant ; systemic glucocorticoid use prohibit Phase Ia patient ) Any know contraindication Zostavax® vaccine , include allergy sensitivity gelatin vaccine component Known HIV/AIDS Currently receive radiation chemotherapy type malignancy Any current use ( within last 30 day ) acyclovir , valacyclovir , famciclovir , foscarnet Receipt immunization within one month study vaccination ( 2 week case inactivate influenza vaccine nonreplicating immunization product [ e.g. , diphtheriatetanus ( dT ) , pneumococcal vaccine , hepatitis A vaccine , hepatitis B vaccine ] ) , schedule within 6 week recruitment . Active infection intercurrent illness ( e.g. , urinary tract infection , influenza ) Participated investigational study within 1 month prior study entry Active drug alcohol use , dependence , reason , opinion site investigator , would interfere study Significant underlying illness would expect prevent completion study ( e.g. , lifethreatening disease likely limit survival le 3 year ) Any reason , opinion site investigator , would interfere require study related evaluation ( e.g . uncontrolled comorbidity , life expectancy &lt; 1 year ) Patients household contact varicellasusceptible pregnant woman severely immunosuppressed individual without history primary varicella .</criteria>
