	<brief_title>A Study Lenalidomide Pediatric Subjects With Relapsed Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter , open-label , single-arm , Phase 2 , Simon 's Optimal two-stage design study , Optional Extension Phase ( OEP ) , assess activity , safety Pharmacokinetics ( PK ) lenalidomide pediatric subject 1 ≤ 18 year age second great Relapsed Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia ( rrAML ) . A total 43 evaluable subject ( 18 subject Stage 1 additional 25 subject Stage 2 ) require assessment primary endpoint . To allow subject find unevaluable primary endpoint due incorrect diagnosis , disease assessment post screening , discontinue prior receive lenalidomide , 4 additional subject may enrol maximum 47 evaluable subject across approximately 70 site . Approximately 50 % enrolled subject young 12 year age provide adequate PK data age subset . If Stage 1 , least 3 18 subject achieve morphologic complete response ( either CR CRi ) within first 4 cycle study treatment , study proceed Stage 2 ; otherwise , study terminate . Similarly , final analysis , least 8 43 evaluable subject across Stages 1 2 achieve response ( CR/CRi ) within first 4 cycle study treatment , conclude lenalidomide sufficient activity pediatric Acute Myeloid Leukemia ( AML ) warrant subsequent study . The optional extension phase ( OEP ) allow subject demonstrate clinical benefit , assess Investigator completion 12 cycle lenalidomide therapy , continue receive oral lenalidomide meet criterion study discontinuation . In OEP , safety , dose , concomitant medications/procedures , second primary malignancy ( SPMs ) monitor .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects must satisfy follow criterion enrol study : 1 . Male female 1 ≤ 18 year age time sign Informed Consent Form / Informed Assent Form ( ICF/IAF ) . 2 . Subject ( applicable , parental/legal representative ) must understand voluntarily provide permission ICF/IAF prior conduct studyrelated assessments/procedures . 3 . Subject Relapsed Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia ( rrAML ) least 2 prior induction attempt : Bone marrow aspirate biopsy must ≥ 5 % blast morphology and/or flow cytometry . Each block chemotherapy separate reinduction attempt . Donor lymphocyte infusion ( DLI ) consider reinduction attempt . 4 . Subject willing able adhere study visit schedule protocol requirement . 5 . Subject Karnofsky score ≥ 50 % ( subject ≥ 16 year age ) Lansky score ≥ 50 % ( subject &lt; 16 year age ) . 6 . Subject resting leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) ≥ 40 % obtain echocardiography . 7 . Subject recover acute toxic effect prior chemotherapy , immunotherapy , radiotherapy prior first dose . All prior treatmentrelated toxicity must resolve ≤ Grade 2 prior enrollment . 8 . Regarding radiation therapy , time elapse prior first dose lenalidomide : 2 week local palliative radiation therapy ( XRT ) . 8 week prior craniospinal chemoradiation therapy ( CRT ) ≥ 50 % radiation pelvis . 6 week bone marrow radiation administer . 9 . Graftversushost disease criterion : Subject must least 2 month ( first dose lenalidomide ) stem cell infusion . Subject must evidence active acute chronic GVHD ( Grade 0 ) 4 week prior first dose lenalidomide . If subject history maximum Grade 1 2 GVHD treat systemic steroid ( ≥ 0.5 mg/kg/day prednisone equivalent ) nonsteroid systemic IST , subject must IST least 2 week , must cease treatment dos steroid GVHD ( ≥ 0.5 mg/kg/day prednisone equivalent ) least 4 week . If subject history Grade 3 great GVHD , subject must systemic IST 4 week Topical therapy permit imply subject active acute chronic GVHD . Physiologic dose hydrocortisone permit . 10 . At least 4 week ( first dose ) elapse donor lymphocyte infusion ( DLI ) without condition . 11 . Subject adequate renal function , define : Creatinine clearance calculate use Schwartz formula , radioisotope glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) &gt; 70 mL/min/1.73 m2 . 12 . Subject adequate liver function , define : • Total bilirubin ≤ 2 mg/dL unless increase bilirubin attributable Gilbert 's Syndrome • AST ≤ 3.0 x upper normal limit ( ULN ) age . For purpose study , ULN AST 50 U/L . • ALT ≤ 3.0 x upper normal limit ( ULN ) age . For purpose study , ULN ALT 45 U/L . 13 .
