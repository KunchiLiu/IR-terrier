	<brief_summary>Viral respiratory infection common often require use health care resource . Patients receive inappropriate bacterial antibiotic , many problem include side-effects , development resistance cost . A small portion infection lead severe clinical manifestation include hospitalisation death . The significance influenza virus well know actively detect age group . However , benefit detect respiratory virus mainly study among child among adult . The development multiplex PCR technique provide new sensitive method diagnose large panel virus . To convince economical benefit rapid viral diagnostic adult infectious patient , evidence need . In randomized study , nasal pharyngeal sample patient evaluate emergency clinic internal medicine University Hospital Oulu respiratory symptom , chest pain fever , collect . The sample test 16 different respiratory virus use Anyplex TMII RV16 Detection . The adult participant randomize two group . In one group result test report attend physician soon possible , group 7 day sample . The effect delay patient care monitor . Also result child adult compare well result men woman . The hypothesis rapid viral diagnostics shortens length admission diminishes use bacterial antibiotic . New information viral epidemiology among child adult provide clinical manifestation specific viral infection adult describe . The estimated 1500 sample also test 5 different respiratory bacteria Anyplex TM II RB5 Detection . These result examine completion study period . The benefit rapid bacterial detection evaluate respect clinical course disease consider infection control aspects well .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rapid Viral Diagnostics Adults Reduce Antimicrobial Consumption Duration Hospitalization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aim Hypothesis The aim study : 1 . To find modern rapid multiplex-PCR base respiratory virus detection method affect patient care 2 . To examine shorten length admission reduce antibiotic consumption 3 . Compare seasonality different virus child adult 4 . Investigate development progress epidemic 5 . Study difference prevalence severity infection gender 6 . Describe clinical manifestation different viral infection adult 7 . View closely certain subgroup patient chest pain respect different viral epidemic effect hospital admission rate 8 . Evaluate information provide bacterial detection Subjects Our hospital regional university hospital time . Patients come clinic quite large area surround city Oulu represent general population area well . The study population recruit 2014-2015 emergency clinic pediatric internal medicine patient Oulu University Hospital . Participants patient respiratory infection symptom , chest pain fever . Fever determine body temperature 38 degree centigrade measure either hospital home . Study design This randomized clinical trial evaluate impact modern multiplex PCR base respiratory virus diagnostics treatment outcome adult patient . Participants randomize two group result report either immediately week ( Picture 1 ) . In child viral PCR diagnostics already routinely use collection nasal pharyngeal sample continue normally . All pediatric result report immediately . Approval ethical review board Northern Ostrobothnia Hospital District acquire . Course study Data collection All patient enter internal medicine emergency clinic respiratory infection symptom ( cough , rhinitis , shortness breath , sore throat ) , chest pain fever give opportunity participate study . After sign informed consent nasal pharyngeal swab take viral examination . Adult patient randomize two different group . In one group result viral detection report immediately group report 7 day sample . Samples analyze microbiological laboratory real time PCR method Anyplex TMII detect genome 16 different respiratory virus 5 different bacterial pathogen ( Table 1 ) . Results delay group give earlier case clinician requesting . The result bacterial finding analyze completion study since clinical relevance clear yet . The bacteriological diagnostic patient study relies routinely use method . The attend clinician decides treatment care patient independently . Patient 's chart review course disease , antibiotic use , ICU care length hospital stay . The result key laboratory test microbiological finding collect . Radiological finding register . At discharge , participant ask report duration symptom , absence work date possible doctor follow . The population register centre use end study find number decease , time cause death record . Table 1 . Microbes detect study sample Viruses ( AnyplexTMII RV16 Detection ) Adenovirus Influenza A/B virus Parainfluenza virus1/2/3/4 Rhinovirus A/B/C Respiratory syncytial virus A/B Bocavirus 1/2/3/4 Metapneumovirus Coronavirus 229E/NL63/OC43 Enterovirus Data analysis The length hospital admission use bacterial antibiotic compare randomized group . Viral finding child adult evaluate . The emergence viruses different area district well different age group examine . The difference clinical picture microbiological finding gender view . The symptoms clinical finding adult detect RSV metapneumovirus describe . The bacterial finding evaluate compare clinical data determine significance information provide test . Impact study In hospital major part viral respiratory infection diagnostics adult accomplish influenza virus antigen detection . Now sensitive measure detect 16 different respiratory pathogen nasopharyngeal sample available . We determine whether specific identification etiological agent affect patient care . If accurate diagnostics diminishes inappropriate antibiotic use save patient potential side effect society unnecessary cost . Importantly also save microbial flora antibiotic selection pressure consider facilitate emergence antibiotic resistance . In child benefit accurate diagnostics recognize adult still progress . This study design demonstrate advantage adult .</detailed_description>
