	<brief_summary>While positron emission tomography/computed tomography ( PET/CT ) assist diagnosis Parkinson disease ( PD ) , also potentially help monitor treatment option PD . One experimental therapeutic option PD fetal dopaminergic transplantation trial . A potential goal novel therapy replace deficient dopaminergic neuron PD . Researchers University Saskatchewan frontier excite treatment option . [ 18F ] FDOPA PET/CT image successfully use author monitor engraftment ass efficacy fetal dopaminergic transplant . This study also aim utilize [ 18F ] FDOPA PET/CT image potentially aid detecting alteration dopaminergic pathway innovative surgical treatment option . There two main objective study : 1 ) Evaluate effectiveness fetal dopaminergic graft patient PD use FDOPA PET image pre post-surgical implantation secondary long term goal 2 ) Correlate [ 18F ] FDOPA PET/CT finding early PD post-mortem pathological analysis PD</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Using 18FFDOPA PET/CT Monitor Effectiveness Fetal Dopaminergic Grafts Parkinson Disease Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Since progression PD case inexorable , urgent need curative restorative treatment , especially patient whose response pharmaceutical treatment mar levodopa-evoked dyskinesia , intolerable on-off fluctuation . This project focus option surgical implantation embryonic dopamine neuron . Despite promising report early case study , dare approach always show consistent clinical outcome . The factor responsible state affair remain uncertain , although study show significantly well clinical outcome young PD patient ( ≤ 60 year ) compare old patient ( ≥ 60 year ) . In number small clinical study , researcher University Saskactchewan show one consistent improvement clinical outcome fetal dopaminergic graft , confirm recent review literature . Follow-up FDOPA-PET study link enhanced tracer uptake target region persistent improvement unify parkison disease rating scale ( UPDRS ) , FDOPA-PET informative relationship target specific striatal region occurrence dyskinesia . Co-aaplicants research study receive approval fund undertake new clinical trial fetal dopaminergic neuron treatment advance otherwise refractory PD . The main objective present study correlate clinical outcome PD patient undergo fetal dopamine neuron transplantation new study protocol change FDOPA-PET/CT . Neurologists University Saskachewan Royal University Hospital-Saskatoon assemble extensive database PD patient follow prospectively long decade . As noted , relationship FDOPA-PET/CT post-mortem finding poorly document small patient sample , even though autopsy finding remain gold standard differential diagnosis parkinsonian syndrome , note . The established reputation neurologist PD community continue important prerequisite brain banking Saskatchewan , important side objective project integrate molecular image prospective post mortem analysis extensively-documented PD patient .</detailed_description>
