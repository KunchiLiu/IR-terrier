	<brief_summary>Postoperative pain pose significant challenge postoperative recovery patient undergo major colorectal surgery . Traditionally , opioids play important role treat postoperative pain . It well establish opioids highly effective relieve pain ; however opioids associate numerous side effect include nausea , vomit , constipation , ileus , bladder dysfunction , respiratory depression , pruritus , drowsiness , sedation , allergic reaction . These opioid side effect , range severity , significantly interfere discharge home follow colorectal surgery . Significant interest exists use local anesthetic base regional anesthesia technique mean extend analgesic window patient undergoing colorectal surgery . Specifically , use TAP block adjunct postoperative pain control widely report anesthesia colorectal surgery literature . Historically , block perform blind fashion relative success presently block typically perform either ultrasound guidance laparoscopic visualization . While TAP block show effective post-operative pain control , technique use place block formally compare . The investigator purpose prospective , patient-blinded , randomized study patient undergo major colorectal surgery compare TAP block ultrasound guidance versus laparoscopic visualization versus TAP block . The investigator hypothesize laparoscopic-guided TAP block non-inferior ultrasound-guided TAP block respect perioperative pain control either technique superior TAP . In addition investigator measure procedural time , adverse event related block , overall postoperative analgesic requirement , analgesic duration , postoperative pain score , length postoperative hospital stay , incidence postoperative ileus , overall patient satisfaction three group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison Ultrasound Guided Transversus Abdominis Plane Nerve Block Techniques</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The propose study patient-blinded , prospective randomize study compare ultrasound-guided block TAP versus laparoscopic-guided TAP block versus TAP block patient undergo major colorectal surgery . The primary outcome measure analgesic requirement morphine equivalent first 24 hour surgery . Secondary outcome measure include overall postoperative analgesic requirement , postoperative pain score , length postoperative hospital stay , adverse event related TAP block , overall perioperative complication 30-day postoperative period overall patient satisfaction major colorectal surgery . All group receive general anesthesia primary mode anesthesia . Patients randomize one two treatment arm also undergo either ultrasound-guided laparoscopic-guided TAP block operate room conclusion procedure . Patients randomize TAP TAP block perform receive routine intraoperative postoperative analgesia deem appropriate anesthesia primary surgical team . A standardized preoperative non-opioid pain regimen utilized . In recovery room , short act opioids breakthrough pain available . Opioids also administer rescue need . All patient receive postoperative intravenous narcotic via patient control analgesia ( PCA ) device . STUDY METHODS I . Recruitment 1 . Patients investigator recruit study preoperative outpatient appointment approximately one week surgery . The study material packet contain HIPAA informed consent form email patient review . Thus patient adequate time ask question consider study prior schedule surgery . 2 . The patient contact one study investigator morning surgery time sign consent obtain . 3 . Only patient provide write consent indicate introduce study prior meet anesthesiologist day surgery able participate . 4 . Screening procedure make sure patient meet inclusion criterion . II . In preoperative hold area : 1 . An anesthesia investigator assign specific case assess patient perform pre-operative anesthesia assessment per standard protocol CSMC . None data record write informed consent obtain . 2 . Patients provide detailed medical history include demographic information ( e.g. , age , weight , height , ethnic origin , smoke history , history motion sickness , history postoperative nausea vomiting , well chronic analgesic usage ) . None data record write informed consent obtain . 3 . Written inform consent obtain one investigator . 4 . Patients randomize blinded fashion study staff one group via online randomization site , sealedenvelope.com , 2:2:1 fashion . Group 1 n=100 Ultrasound guide TAP Block Group 2 n=100 Laparoscopic guide TAP Block Group 3 n=40 No TAP III . During intraoperative period 1 . Standard anesthesia monitor apply : automatic blood pressure cuff , three-lead electrocardiography , capnography , pulse oximetry use continuously . 2 . Induction general gnesthesia propofol 2-3 mg/kg &amp; non-depolarizing muscle relaxant ( choice operator dependent ) . Maintenance anesthesia inhalational anesthetic . 3 . The study staff perform randomization instruct anesthesiologist surgeon either block transversus abdominis plane ultrasound , laparoscopy , block . 4 . For block , standard weight base dose ( bupivacaine 0.25 % epinephrine 1:200,000 , 1ml/kg dose ) use ultrasound-guided laparoscopic-guided block . 5 . The block administer costal margin iliac crest anterior axillary line 2 different site side ( 4 injection total ) . 6 . For ultrasound-guided TAP block , surgeon complete portion procedure , member anesthesia research team use sterile technique prep abdomen . The block place bilaterally ( 2 different site side abdomen ) anterior axillary line , costal margin iliac crest intermuscular plane internal oblique transversus abdominis muscle use ultrasound guidance . 7 . For laparoscopic-guided TAP block , attend surgeon perform block conclusion procedure laparoscopic guidance . Bilateral TAP block perform anterior axillary line costal margin iliac crest . After needle pass skin , continue 2 distinct `` pop '' felt , indicate needle pierce 2 fascia layer ( external oblique internal oblique fascia ) . After injection correct plane , smooth raise area fluid cover transversus abdominis muscle see laparoscope . The laparoscopic vision also assure preperitoneal plane inject injection go intraperitoneal . 8 . Dose anesthetic , analgesic , local anesthetic , IV fluid therapy operation record anesthesia record per standard procedure . A copy sonographic image collect patient conclusion block . 9 . Duration surgery ( skin incision closure ) anesthesia ( induction spinal discontinuation anesthetic drug ) record anesthesia record per standard procedure . IV . PACU 1 . Verbal rating scale ( VRS ) pain assess PACU RN upon arrival recovery room , every 30min interval discharge . Requirements `` rescue '' analgesic medication record discharge . 2 . Any adverse event perioperative period also note PACU RN . V. Following completion surgery ( post-operative ) : 1 . Anesthesia discontinue skin closure . 2 . Patients transferred recovery room emergence sedation 3 . Treatment surgical pain prior discharge recovery room : moderate-to-severe pain ( VRS &gt; 7 ) : hydromorphone , 1-1.5 mg IV , moderate pain ( VRS 4-6 ) : hydromorphone 0.5 - 1 mg IV. , mild pain ( VRS 2-3 ) , hydromorphone 0.1-0.2 mg IV . Patient pain control medication continue initial treatment medication subsequent rescue dos need recovery room discharge . 4 . Patient nausea , vomit , retch initially treat ondansetron 4mg IV . Patients unresponsive ondansetron receive metoclopramide 10mg IV . 5 . Patient discharge criterion PACU include : awake alert , stable vital sign . VI . Patient evaluation hospital admission : - VRS pain assessment utilized ass pain within first 72 hour postoperatively pain score record patient chart nursing staff per routine CSMC protocol . The average pain score calculate study analysis . - VRS score along dose opioids record . - Physical sign symptom related peripheral nerve block ( residual sensory blockade ) note . - Patient satisfaction overall technique also query . Pain evaluation record nursing staff per standard CSMC guideline : - At PACU every 30 minute - During admission : 12 , 24 , 48 , 72 hour postoperatively Patient satisfaction analgesia assess time hospital discharge within 30 day postoperatively telephone use patient satisfaction survey .</detailed_description>
