	<brief_summary>Cancer treatment often cause acute toxicity treatment , late toxicity treatment end . Bowel dysfunction , incontinence ( anal urinary ) dysfunction late side effect associated cancer treatment general , patient treat pelvic malignancy higher risk . In Norway , incidence rectal cancer 1329 2010 . Advances treatment past decade lead few local recurrence increase long-term survival , today relative survival 66 % woman 64 % men . More patient sphincter-preserving surgery low colorectal ultralow coloanal anastomosis , low anterior resection ( LAR ) do 70 % patient curative surgery . Unfortunately , many patient experience alter bowel function LAR . Frequent bowel movement , urgency , evacuatory difficulty fecal incontinence common distressing complication . These functional disturbance see 50-60 % patient , frequent surgery combine neoadjuvant therapy . Urinary incontinence decrease sexual function also common men woman follow rectal cancer treatment . In many surgical setting , patient higher preoperative physical fitness rehabilitate quickly fewer operative complication compare patient less physically fit . Additionally , specific strength training pelvic floor muscle build muscle volume , elevate location pelvic floor muscle pelvic organ , close levator hiatus thus provide improved structural support pelvic floor well optimal automatic function . The aim present trial investigate whether exercise training include pelvic floor muscle train preoperative radiotherapy reduce symptom bowel , urinary sexual dysfunction affect physiology anal sphincter muscle LAR . In addition quality life , cardiopulmonary parameter postoperative complication study .</brief_summary>
