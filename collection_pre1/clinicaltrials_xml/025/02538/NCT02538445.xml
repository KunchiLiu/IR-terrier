	<brief_summary>Based theory embody cognition , focus influence sensory motor process cognition , researcher propose study influence action memorization inhibition patient suffer schizophrenia , use direct forgetting paradigm . The directed forgetting paradigm use , compose two list action verb . The instruction `` forget '' give end learn first list ( To Be Forgotten ( TBF ) ) , follow simulation computer bug . Therefore second list present learn remember ( To Be Remembered ( TBR ) ) . A recognition task perform end . The action verb encode use four condition : action perform , mime , imagined action , action contextual word , read action verb . 48 schizophrenic patient include study . Patients randomize 10 participant per condition . 48 control match age , gender , laterality education also include randomized modality . This study aim show encode sensory-motor component , provide context could improve inhibitory capacity also memory schizophrenia , possibly use remediation cognitive .</brief_summary>
