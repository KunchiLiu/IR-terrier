	<brief_summary>Cerebrovascular disease lead cause death lead cause serious long-term disability . Carotid artery stenting ( CAS ) carotid endarterectomy ( CEA ) alternative strategy stroke prevention patient atherosclerotic carotid disease.The safety efficacy CAS compare CEA still remain questioned , CEA consider first-line treatment carotid stenosis worldwide . The purpose study compare practice outcomes CAS CEA real world set Public University Hospitals Brazil .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study prospective analysis treatment patient carotid stenosis carotid endarterectomy carotid artery stenting perform 5 center propose five year Vascular Study Group public Universities Sao Paulo state Brazil . The primary outcome measure : 1. in-hospital stroke . 2. stroke , death , myocardial infarction ( MI ) . Patients undergo CEA conjunction cardiac surgery exclude . Multivariate logistic regression perform identify predictor stroke death patient undergo CEA CAS . The characteristic background patient underwent CAS CEA include : age , gender , carotid endarterectomy high risk ; also presentation symptom , degree stenosis analyze . Next , procedural success , periprocedural antiplatelet use , embolic protection device use , type stent ( open-cell closed-cell ) patch carotid , execution pre ballooning post ballooning dilatation carotid artery stenting , procedure-related complication analyze clarify current strategy treatment result technique . Degree stenosis measure accordance North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial method . Outcomes stratified symptomatic asymptomatic status . Symptomatic patient define neurologic event , include hemispheric ocular transient ischemic attack , major minor stroke precede intervention ipsilateral treat lesion . Technical success relate periprocedural event occur initiation procedure extend first 24-hour postoperative period . Primary technical success define intent-to-treat basis , require successful exclusion carotid plaque surgical interventional mean . Technical success include outcome complication preoperative carotid angiogram whenever image study obtain prior carotid intervention . For carotid endarterectomy , primary technical success implies successful removal carotid plaque closure artery without patch le 30 % residual stenosis . For carotid stenting , introduction deployment embolic protection device carotid stent absence stroke , myocardial infarction , death , surgical conversion , vascular obstruction constitutes primary technical success . All complication categorize local vascular , local nonvascular , systemic . Other complication . As vascular procedure , complication carotid intervention report systematic standardized manner description degree severity . Although assign degree severity complication different method treatment may difficult , severity scale provide whenever possible adverse event assess compare . The following severity scale modify reporting standard low extremity ischemia : Mild ( 1 ) refers complication resolve spontaneously minimal intervention , increase hospital length stay , cause permanent disability . Moderate ( 2 ) refers need significant intervention , prolongation hospitalization 24 hour , , minor permanent disability interfere normal daily activity . A severe complication ( 3 ) need major surgical , endovascular medical intervention , may associate prolonged convalescence , usually accompany prolonged permanent disability , may result death .</detailed_description>
