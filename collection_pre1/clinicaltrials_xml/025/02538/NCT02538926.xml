	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well etoposide , prednisone , vincristine sulfate , cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin hydrochloride asparaginase work treat patient acute lymphoblastic leukemia lymphoblastic lymphoma . Drugs use chemotherapy , etoposide , prednisone , vincristine sulfate , cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin hydrochloride , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Asparaginase break amino acid asparagine may block growth tumor cell need asparagine grow . Giving combination chemotherapy asparaginase may work well treat patient acute lymphoblastic leukemia lymphoblastic lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Etoposide , Prednisone , Vincristine Sulfate , Cyclophosphamide , Doxorubicin Hydrochloride With Asparaginase Treating Patients With Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Lymphoblastic Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine efficacy dose-adjusted etoposide , prednisone , vincristine sulfate , cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin hydrochloride plus asparaginase ( DA-EPOCH-A ) adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma ( ALL ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety feasibility regimen . OUTLINE : Patients receive etoposide , doxorubicin hydrochloride , vincristine sulfate intravenously ( IV ) continuously day 1-4 , cyclophosphamide IV 1 hour day 5 , prednisone orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-5 . Patients also receive asparaginase intramuscularly ( IM ) IV 1-2 hour every 2-3 day , begin day 7 course . Patients cluster differentiation ( CD ) 20 positive Philadelphia chromosome negative also receive rituximab IV day 1 5 . Patients Philadelphia chromosome positive also receive imatinib mesylate PO day 1-14 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 8 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
