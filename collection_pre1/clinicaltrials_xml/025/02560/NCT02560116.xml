	<brief_title>The Role Echocardiographic Contrast ( Optison ) Enhancing Tricuspid Regurgitation Spectral Doppler Signals</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In United States , pulmonary hypertension ( PHT ) increasingly recognize cause morbidity mortality . Echocardiography , due widespread use , versatility , portability , noninvasive nature , safety , routinely use primary method diagnosis evaluation patient . However , cohort , accuracy frequently compromise poor acoustic window . The use echocardiographic contrast ( EC ) patient may increase diagnostic accuracy , eliminate need perform invasive , time-consuming , expensive test , eliminate potential diagnostic management error . Pulmonary Artery Systolic Pressure ( PASP ) routinely measure noninvasively transthoracic echocardiography ( TTE ) obtain tricuspid regurgitant velocity ( TRV ) continuous wave spectral Doppler apply modify Bernoulli equation . The investigator aim use FDA approve perflutren-based EC agent Optison augment inadequate TR CW spectral Doppler envelope determine TRV PASP measurement obtain use Optison correlate well invasive measurement obtain simultaneously right heart catheterization oppose measurement obtain without use EC .</detailed_description>
