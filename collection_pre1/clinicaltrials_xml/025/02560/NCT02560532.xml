	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety potential therapeutic benefit use clazosentan reverse cerebral vasospasm ( narrow blood vessel brain due presence blood space around brain ) patient suffered condition know aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage cause bleed onto surface brain rupture brain aneurysm</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Efficacy Safety Clazosentan Reversing Cerebral Vasospasm Adult Subjects With Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage ( aSAH ) characterize bleed onto brain surface due rupture pouch bulge brain vessel ( call aneurysm ) . It rare serious condition high risk death . Even patient successful repair aneurysm remain risk develop cerebral vasospasm , result harmful condition relate lack oxygen part brain death . Cerebral vasospasm usually occur within first couple week aSAH , difficult treat . Currently safe , efficacious widely available treatment . Previous animal study show new drug investigation , clazosentan , able reverse cerebral vasospasm animal model SAH . A first trial conduct small number patient show benefit clazosentan reverse establish cerebral vasospasm aSAH . Clazosentan already evaluate prevention cerebral vasospasm several large clinical trial aSAH . This current study aim evaluate clazosentan effective safe treatment cerebral vasospasm aSAH .</detailed_description>
