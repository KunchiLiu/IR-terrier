Therefore , often prepared beverage . It rich carbohydrate vitamin C. It also claim numerous ailment include antitumor , antimicrobial , urease inhibitory lipoxygenase activity . In addition , cashew apple juice also excellent anti-oxidant potential . The preclinical data also demonstrate cognitive deficit rat induce cholinotoxin receive A.occidentale cashew fruit juice 2 week show neuroprotective cognitive enhance effects.Therefore , potential benefit Cashew apple juice physical fitness psychological fitness middle age elderly focus .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Cashew Apple Juice Physiological Psychological Fitness Middle Aged Elderly Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently , age-related health problem increase importance markedly due increase elderly population . These problem produce great socio-economic burden country . In addition , quality elderly family also decrease . Therefore , anti-aging strategy elderly gain much attention . Based role oxidative stress free radical age-related pathology , development anti-aging health product substance possess antioxidant effect focus . Cashew Anacardium occidentale Linn , one economic plant Thailand , originate Latin America possess antioxidant effect . In Latin America , plant use anti-aging memory enhancer . Data obtain animal study also show cashew apple juice could enhance memory increased muscle performance induce fatigue resistance . Therefore , cashew apple potential develop physical psychological fitness enhancer heath product elderly . However , scientific data available . Therefore , study aim develop cashew apple juice base functional drink determine effect 12- week consumption cashew apple juice physical psychological fitness middle age elderly volunteer . The consumption safety develop drink also investigate . The developed cashew apple juice base functional drink show antioxidant acetylcholinesterase suppression activity . Therefore , use investigation effect 12- week consumption cashew apple juice physical psychological fitness middle age elderly volunteer . In study , healthy middle age elderly volunteer recruit participate study divide various group consist placebo Cashew drink treat group dose 120 240 mg/day . All subject consume assign drink 12 week . They determine parameter related physical psychological fitness treatment every 4 week throughout study period . The assessment also perform 4 week cessation cashew apple juice base drink consumption . The physical fitness assessment perform via battery test consist various test include 30-second chair stand test measure muscle strength low extremity , hand grip strength test measure muscle strength hand , 6-minute walk test measure cardio-pulmonary endurance Tandem test measure postural balance . The alteration oxidative stress marker include malondialdehyde level activity superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) , catalase ( CAT ) glutathione peroxidase ( GSH-Px ) blood also motor . The result show volunteer consume cashew apple juice base drink dose 240 mg/day improve performance 30-second chair stand test 6-minute walk test 12 week consumption period . The enhanced GSH-Px activity decrease MDA level also observe . Therefore , data obtain study demonstrate increased muscle strength low extremity cardio-pulmonary endurance middle-aged elderly volunteer . The possible underlying mechanism might occur partly via improve oxidative stress status . In order evaluate psychological fitness , work memory assess use computerized battery test attention cognitive processing assess via event relate potential . Emotion assess via Bond-LÃ¤der test whereas psychological symptom evaluate symptoms checklist-90 ( SCL-90 ) . In addition , function cholinergic monoaminergic system especially dopamine also evaluate use activity acetylcholinesterase ( AChE ) , monoamine oxidase ( MAO B ) indices respectively . The assessment perform time schedule physical assessment . The result show subject consume cashew apple juice base drink dose 240 mg/day show following change ; 1 ) work memory improves domains include increase power attention , increase continuity attention , speed memory quality memory 2 ) decrease latency increase amplitude N100 P300 3 ) suppression AChE MAO-B . Therefore , current data reveal volunteer consume cashew apple juice base drink dose 240 mg/day enhance attention cognitive processing ability give rise improve working memory . The possible underlying mechanism might occur partly via improve cholinergic dopaminergic function . When quality life determine use Quest quality questionnaire modify SF-36 end study , result show volunteer consume cashew apple juice base drink show high quality life volunteer consume placebo . These suggest cashew apple juice base drink improved physical psychological fitness quality life middle-aged elderly volunteer . In order assure consumption safety consumer , assessment hematological chemical change volunteer also perform . The result show toxicity observe throughout study period . The result obtain study demonstrate cashew apple juice base drink improved physical psychological fitness together quality life without toxicity . Therefore , develop cashew apple juice base drink potential serve functional drink order enhance physical psychological fitness middle-aged elderly .</detailed_description>
