	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate new use medication call levodopa ( L-DOPA ) . L-DOPA approve use Parkinson 's disease , Posttraumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) . L-DOPA thought enhance certain cognitive ability investigator believe may affect among woman PTSD . It hypothesize L-DOPA may enhance fear extinction learning condition fear stimulus . If true , L-DOPA may improve outcome undergo certain type therapy PTSD , though aim beyond scope project . Additionally , investigator test whether individual 's genetic profile affect well L-DOPA work enhance cognitive ability .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dopamine Enhancement Fear Extinction Learning PTSD ( 1R21MH108753 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current state-of-the art treatment posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) lack efficacy . There two main evidence-based psychological treatment PTSD . Prolonged Exposure ( PE ) largely-exposure base intervention find efficacious reduction PTSD symptom ; however , PE associate post-treatment remission rate ~53-60 % . Cognitive Processing Therapy ( CPT ) also widely study efficacious psychological treatment PTSD , focus exposure trauma memory well cognitive therapy technique . As PE , post-treatment remission rate CPT ~53-60 % , thus also indicate need improvement overall efficacy consistency response across individual . There emerge research demonstrate dopamine critical consolidation subsequent recall fear extinction learning . A recent study healthy adult human demonstrate oral administration 150 mg L-DOPA fear extinction learn lead decreased fear responding , even test new context . Further , study also find resting-state functional connectivity , measure ~45 minute post-extinction learn L-DOPA administration , ventral tegmental area ( VTA ) mPFC correlate magnitude medial prefrontal cortex ( mPFC ) recruitment recall fear extinction learning . This latter finding suggest mechanism L-DOPA boost consolidation fear extinction learn acutely reorganize dopaminergic resting-state network . Indeed , study demonstrate acute effect L-DOPA administration resting-state functional connectivity within dopaminergic neural network . Thus , agent increase dopamine transmission acutely post-extinction learn consolidation window , thereby acutely alter organization dopaminergic neural network , show promise boosting consolidation fear extinction memory decrease fear respond . Genetic variation primary contributor individual difference baseline dopamine neurotransmission . Individuals specific allele gene cod high baseline dopamine demonstrate well performance task probe work memory , cognitive control , social cognition . Genetic variant baseline dopamine neurotransmission would therefore expect modulate performance-enhancing effect L-DOPA , individual low endogenous would expect increased performance upon exogenously increase dopamine neurotransmission ; whereas individual high endogenous dopamine would expect performance deteriorate exogenously increase dopamine neurotransmission . In support hypothesis , recent study find interaction L-DOPA administration endogenous dopamine neurotransmission ( indicated polygenic score pool across catechol-O-methyltransferase ( COMT ) , dopamine transporter protein ( DAT ) , dopamine D1 receptor ( DRD1-3 ) ) motor learn performance , individual combination allele cod high baseline dopamine demonstrate weak learning benefit L-DOPA , whereas individual combination allele cod low baseline dopamine demonstrate strong learning benefit L-DOPA . These data demonstrate non-linear relationship performance dopamine level , suggest investigation potential effect boost dopamine neurotransmission mean boost learn need account baseline dopamine neurotransmission . Overall , propose project seek demonstrate engagement post-extinction dopamine neurotransmission downstream acute reorganization dopaminergic resting-state neural network mean increase consolidation generic fear extinction learn adult woman PTSD .</detailed_description>
