	<brief_summary>PLUMMB phase I trial investigate safety , tolerability effectiveness immunotherapy drug call Pembrolizumab use combination radiotherapy . The study also investigate two different dos pembrolizumab , start 100mg ( intravenous drip ) increase 200mg next cohort patient , first dose well tolerate . The patient suitable study : Group A locally advanced bladder cancer Group B patient whose cancer spread bladder ( metastatic bladder cancer ) . Treatment PLUMMB trial start pembrolizumab 2 week prior start course 6 week radiotherapy . Treatment pembrolizumab give every three week . Patients Group A continue take pembrolizumab year unless disease progression unacceptable side effect meantime . Patients Group B continue take pembrolizumab long need disease progression unacceptable side effect . Patients see every 3 week treatment every 3-6 month thereafter . CT scan do every 3 month treatment per usual care ( usually 6 monthly ) treatment finish . Patients Group A also cystoscopy ( camera test ) look bladder 3 month finish radiotherapy . This standard care would patient research study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Risk burden patient Patients study cancer often prove hard control standard care . The early phase nature study mean intervention may benefit patient take part study . However , still receive standard treatment radiotherapy . Throughout study , patient significant side effect trial drug withdrawn trial still eligible receive standard care . The study carry number potential burden : - Experimental nature study drug . The drug stimulate immune system produce proteins attack tumour cell . It think selective tumour cells; however possible effect normal tissue may cause side effect . These risk manage much possible regular ( 3 weekly ) clinical assessment hospital outpatient , experience clinician study treatment . Comprehensive assessment safety carry include intensive monitoring blood test . - Burden frequent hospital visit test . Participants study must attend hospital frequently safety reason check toxicity study treatment . Blood test ( usual ) , clinical examination urine test part safety assessment . - Additional investigation may carry part study , research purpose consent sought form patient , additional blood sample additional scan ( CT thorax , abdomen pelvis ) . 2 . Phase 1 trial Pembrolizumab : Patients carefully monitor toxicity throughout trial . A phase I trial already conduct determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) pembrolizumab bladder cancer . To date MTD define maximum dose test show acceptable toxicity positive effect reduce tumour size . This study assess two dose level , 100mg 200mg . Dose escalation occur first group 100mg show sign unacceptable toxicity 11 week complete radiotherapy . 3 . Recruitment Participants offer information study clinical team consider meet entry criterion express interest take part experimental study . It make clear study experimental nature necessarily therapeutic benefit take part study . It also make clear , patient decide take part future care affect . Patients give sufficient time information make inform decision enter trial , less 24 hours; patient enter trial give write informed consent . Inclusion exclusion criterion study standard phase 1 trial new oncology drug . 4 . Confidentiality Patients link unique identifier code hold password protect database held study team . Blood sample , tumour sample processing data analysis take place laboratory Royal Marsden Institute Cancer Research London Sutton . Sample process take place use study number . No patient identifiable information available study sample . Investigators access patient identifiable information password protect NHS hospital note databases . 5 . Conflict Interest Patients may recruit study involve prior clinical care . The investigator expect conflict interest research healthcare duties number reason : patient must give full inform consent enter study , specifically regard unknown efficacy study drug intensive nature study . Those patient continue study maintain relationship clinical team require symptom control . At end study , patient able access result wish , Royal Marsden Website contact study team directly . 6 . Use tissue sample future research If participant give consent , leftover blood tissue sample require study store future unspecified research line human tissue act regulation . Access use sample research purpose require appropriate ethical approval . Future researcher able identify individual patient biobank data , demographic clinical information available .</detailed_description>
