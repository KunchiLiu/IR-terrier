	<brief_title>Cognitive Training Children With Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) chronic developmental disorder characterize symptom inattention , impulsivity hyperactivity correspond child 's developmental level ( American Psychiatric Association , 2013 ) . For diagnosis confirm , symptom must present age 12 must observe least two domain function , school , work , social interaction family life ( American Psychiatric Association , 2013 ) . ADHD one common neurobehavioral disorder prevalence estimate 5-7 % school-age child ( Psychiatric Association , 2013 ) . ADHD alters family , social academic functioning well one 's professional life . Results study indicate work memory inhibition often alter ADHD childhood persist adulthood . Pharmacological treatment ADHD mostly include psychostimulants ( Amphetamine Methylphenidate ) non-stimulants ( Atomoxetine , Clonidine , Guanfacine ) . Stimulants no-stimulants effective manage ADHD symptom . However , treatment present limitation . For instance , comorbid disorder reduce stimulant efficacy ADHD . Further , long-term effect year stimulant yet know . Stimulants may cause side effect sleep , hunger growth . That parent reluctant let child take stimulant . Currently , clinical guideline recommend non-pharmacological intervention conjunction medication treatment ADHD . The above-mentioned limitation use medication stress importance develop non-pharmacological approach . Cognitive train one type non-pharmacological intervention use ADHD . This intervention consist improve cognitive deficit specific exercise intensive training session . A grow number study examine impact cognitive training ADHD . Cognitive training base principle brain plasticity aim train cognitive function improve cognitive deficit ADHD . According author , training change occur neural connection associate ADHD . This modification allow far transfer cognitive function target program , ADHD symptoms academic performance . Results meta-analysis indicated 68 % 25 study examine ADHD cognitive training focus work memory . These author specify Cogmed Working Memory Training currently use study program . Indeed , program available 25 country use 150 clinical practitioner ( http : //www.cogmed.com ) . Currently , one meta-analysis include seven study examine Cogmed Working Memory Training program effect ADHD . Results indicate impact Cogmed cognitive functioning , ADHD symptoms academic performance remain controversial . Cogmed unifactorial program target work memory . In addition type intervention multi-factorial program target different cognitive function Presco also exist less study . Objectives To address challenge , study follow randomize controlled design . The main objective study examine impact cognitive training comparison control group among child ADHD : 1 . ADHD symptom , 2. cognitive functioning , 3. attentional capacity 4. academic achievement . The second objective compare two type cognitive training unifactorial program Cogmed target work memory multifactorial Presco focus different cognitive function affect ADHD . Long-term effect examine six month train . Procedure Participants ( n=90 ) randomly assign three group . 1 . Cogmed® : working memory training ( unifactorial ) 2 . Presco® : different cognitive function train ( multifactorial ) 3 . Control ( wait list ) Participants evaluate three time ( time 1 ) intervention , ( time 2 ) six week first evaluation , immediately intervention ( time 3 ) six month intervention . For Cogmed Presco participant train time . Before begin program appointment one hour organize present program . Participants train home 25 session ( 30-45 minute ) maximum 5-6 week . A coach call participant one week verify program adherence . The coach verify participant result internet call . Cogmed work memory training CogMed® ( RoboMemo , Cognitive Medical Systems AB , Stockholm ) version child use program . Twelve exercise target verbal visio-spatial work memory . Difficulty adjust depend participant performance ` The program PRESCO® ( Program Cognitive Stimulation rehabilitation ) comprise 40 exercise target : verbal visio spatial work memory , attention capacity , reason , executive functioning , language mental imagery . Only exercise target verbal , visual spatial work memory , attentional capacity alter ADHD use present study . Difficulty adjust depend participant performance .</detailed_description>
