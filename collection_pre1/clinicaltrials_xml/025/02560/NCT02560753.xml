	<brief_summary>The study randomize , parallel , 4-dose design subject mild-to-moderate Alzheimer 's Disease . Subjects randomized one 4 dose T3D-959 . Subjects evaluate change baseline cerebral metabolic rate glucose ( FDG-PET imaging ) , functional connectivity hippocampus ( BOLD-fMRI ) , cognitive function ( ADAS-Cog11 DSST ) well assess safety tolerability T3D-959 . An expanded access extension plan provide access study medication subject complete main study request continue use .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>T3D-959 orally-delivered , once-a-day administer , small molecule dual nuclear receptor agonist show animal Phase 1 study normal human subject safe well tolerate . The purpose clinical study AD patient demonstrate mechanistic proof concept T3D-959 , produce desire change cerebral glucose metabolism functional connectivity may indicate potential cognitive improvement . The therapeutic approach test base two supposition ; ( A ) ameliorate multiple pathology disease single therapy may provide superior clinical benefit therapeutic approach target single pathology ( B ) correct insulin resistance brain , ( highly correlate AD potential key driver AD pathophysiology ) peripherally may disease remedial . The brain require integral insulin signal metabolic homeostasis neuronal plasticity . Insulin resistance disrupts energy balance signal network need broad range function . Impaired insulin signal neuron enhances apoptosis , promote oxidative cell death induce Abeta1-42 , increase secretion Abeta1-42 , block removal extracellular Abeta oligomers increase plaque load . A grow body evidence suggest brain insulin resistance promote possibly trigger key pathology AD support observed change level insulin signal molecule AD forebrain associate change memory . Pre-clinical study animal demonstrate insulin sensitizing activity T3D-959 ability improve multiple pathology AD rat model disease . This non-placebo controlled trial conduct one three clinical center . Thirty six ( 36 ) patient mild-to-moderate Alzheimer 's disease randomly assign daily , orally administer treatment 3mg , 10mg , 30mg 90mg dos T3D-959 . Participants treat two week undergo baseline two week ; FDG-PET scan measure brain glucose metabolism , BOLD fMRI scan measure functional connectivity hippocampus , venous blood draw biomarker analysis ApoE genotyping , ADAS-Cog11 DSST cognitive testing . For monitor potential toxicity drug subject undergo physical examination , neurological examination , adverse event review , blood chemistry , pharmacokinetic ( PK ) analyse T3D-959 plasma level . Expanded Access Extension : This open label 10 visit extension 5 subject complete T3D959-201 protocol whose caregiver physician request continued treatment expand access protocol . All subject enrol study treat 15mg q.d . dose T3D959 six month , regardless assign dose level main study . A continued risk/benefit assessment investigator conduct visit determine need treatment continuation . Subjects assess safety tolerability T3D-959 evaluate change baseline cognitive function via ADAS-Cog11 DSST test global change via CIBIC-plus testing .</detailed_description>
