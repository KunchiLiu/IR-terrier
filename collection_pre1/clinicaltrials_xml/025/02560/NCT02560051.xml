	<brief_summary>This study men prostate cancer fail local therapy candidate prostatectomy radiation therapy . The purpose research study assess safety benefit androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT , block hormone ) plus chemotherapy . Degarelix hormone block drug use . Doxorubicin , Ketoconazole , Docetaxel Estramustine chemotherapy drug use . The drug use study approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . Participants treat ADT plus chemotherapy three , four , five 8-week cycle ( 12 , 18 , 24 month ) . The number cycle chemotherapy receive number month receive ADT base disease . The current standard treatment ADT chemotherapy . What differ research study cycle combination chemotherapy drug choose . The drug choose study few side effect believe provide maximum benefit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>As work hypothesis , investigator suspect transformation androgen-dependent androgen-independent phenotype mediate expansion androgen-independent clone already present time ADT continue grow androgen-sensitive clone suppress . It thus desirable bring treatment bear androgen-independent component correspond tumor burden remain minimal prolong time hormone resistance . Investigators view androgen-independent component analogous `` microscopic residual '' `` micro-metastatic '' disease , adjuvant chemotherapy show effective context , even drug little impact survival set advanced disease . By treat component tumor initially , investigator anticipate emergence androgen-independent growth delay , ultimately prolong patient survival . Additionally , instead treat patient empirically identical regimen , investigator 's previous work , patient subset design ensure level treatment appropriate individual disease , thus potentially lessen burden treatment ( long-term adverse effect ADT ) . Investigators choose 3 , 4 , 5 cycle chemotherapy administer basis tumor burden , treatment selection method long establish germ cell tumor use PI . Sub-analyses previous data raise concern treat patient vary level disease way produce optimal result . Therefore , investigator seek improve outcome tailor treatment tumor burden . In study , patient less tumor burden receive 3 cycle chemotherapy 12 month ADT , moderate tumor burden receive 4 cycle 18 month treatment , great tumor burden receive 5 cycle 24 month treatment . Additionally , regimen administer treatment sequentially , include 2-week break , reduce toxicity .</detailed_description>
