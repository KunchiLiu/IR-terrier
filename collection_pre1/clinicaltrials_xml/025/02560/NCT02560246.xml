	<detailed_description>While dietary guideline intake specific nutrient pregnant woman well-established , surprisingly little known dietary eating pattern nutritional risk factor SPTB . In data two large nationally-representative European study , SPTB predict western diet , find confirm small cohort Australia . In small cohort Poland , intake short- medium-chain fatty acid low woman SPTB , placental-fetal transport fatty acid significantly different SPTB case . Furthermore , single serve daily either artificially-sweetened sugar-sweetened beverage also link SPTB . Low blood biomarker level antioxidant nutrient ( ascorbic , vitamin E ) 7 nutrient establish anti-inflammatory role health ( omega 3 fatty acids,8 vitamin D9-11 ) suggest potential nutrient modulators SPTB . While interesting finding , explain whether food pattern prevail urban U.S. population SPTB occur . Furthermore , none potentially modifiable diet association examine context entire series physiological system operate pregnancy , namely diet , gut microbiome , maternal plasma metabolome , placenta , cord blood . There biological rationale assume dietary component could modify gut microbiome maternal plasma metabolome pregnancy . Artificial sweetener induce glucose intolerance alternation gut microbiota . Chronic ingestion sugar-sweetened beverage also result similar plasma metabolic abnormality ( gut microbiome measure report ) . In animal model high fat diet feeding ( similar western diet ) , addition N3FA ameliorate gut dysbiosis reduce endotoxin production . Furthermore , healthy volunteer , investigator recently link typical dietary intake pattern gut microbiome . Dietary pattern high protein animal fat intake predominantly associate Bacteroides enterotypes , carbohydrate intake associate Prevotella . While microbiome composition change rapidly change diet , enterotype identity resilient time . The investigator follow finding another study compare extreme diet vegan ( animal product ) typical mixed western diet pattern omnivore , extend analytical approach include assessment plasma metabolome . By observe microbiome metabolome , investigator clearly able distinguish 91 % accuracy whether subject vegan omnivore . Furthermore , investigator could determine metabolomic characteristic contribute gut bacterial metabolism , subject high plant food intake . These finding healthy volunteer raise possibility gut microbial population could interact maternal tissue plasma produce inflammatory state might result preterm parturition . Indeed , alteration gut microbiota observe third trim pregnancy effect host metabolism supportive notion .</detailed_description>
