	<brief_title>High-risk Patients Cardiac Surgery Procedures : HiriSCORE</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The risk predict model mathematical tool identification patient complication risk cardiac surgery procedure . Over time , however , due technical progress ( development hybrid surgery , new valve prosthesis ) , development new drug , change environment social condition patient live , need improve old develop new model . Based statement high risk patient similar characteristic ( clinical laboratory ) regardless procedure submit , create new risk score group patient must seek . Improving model quality achieve use accurate risk assessment . In general , assessment mortality risk cardiac surgery perform use preoperative risk model ( EuroSCORE II , STS-score ) . However , use improve risk model increase accuracy technique prepare mathematical system , unfortunately , positive impact level prediction , still inaccurate , especially consider group high risk . New model need build good prediction mortality risk , also predict morbidity group patient high risk complication cardiac surgery procedure . The aim study : - To construct HiriSCORE identify patient high risk complication cardiac surgery procedure ( investigator propose high-risk evaluation criterion : EuroSCORE II &gt; 5 STS-score &gt; 5 ) ; - Assessing impact pre- , intra- postoperative period prognosis subsequent morbidity mortality high-risk patient pass cardiac surgery procedure . It decide conduct research two phase . The developmental phase carry 30 month include analysis least 2,000 patient pass cardiac surgery procedure institution hospital involve study . After analysis , include outcome , construct HiriSCORE , new test-model high-risk patient . In validation phase study , involve 1,000 patient plan preparation verification effectiveness HiriSCORE model compare STS Score EuroSCORE II . The study include patient 18 year old old undergone cardiac surgery procedure , coronary artery bypass grafting ( isolated combine heart valve intervention ) , heart valve surgery , surgery ascend aorta ( combine operation aortic valve CABG ) . Totally , propose assessment 130 variable ( factor perceive risk ) patient ( preoperative , intraoperative , 12 hour surgery ) . The study mortality postoperative complication renal replacement therapy , stroke , reoperation bleeding , respiratory failure , cardiogenic shock , carry within 30 day cardiac surgery procedure .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients undergo cardiac surgery procedure , coronary artery bypass grafting , heart valve surgery , cooperation aorta valve CABG variation procedure , regardless operation treatment outcomes Mortality risk STS score &gt; 5 EuroSCORE II &gt; 5 Isolated surgery ascend aorta , aortic arch descend aorta Heart transplantation Impossibility include patientÂ´s data research</criteria>
