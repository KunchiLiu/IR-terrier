	<brief_summary>This trial people bladder cancer spread . The purpose research study see chemotherapy combination gemcitabine cisplatin plus paclitaxel safe effective treatment bladder cancer . Paclitaxel , gemcitabine cisplatin approve United States Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . Gemcitabine cisplatin standard treatment bladder cancer . There study show paclitaxel cisplatin antitumor activity bladder cancer . European researcher study paclitaxel , gemcitabine cisplatin ( drug combination trial ) find combination provide good disease control well tolerate . Investigators study drug combination , different dosage schedule .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The rationale present study develop combination base pharmacokinetics mechanisms action agent paclitaxel plus gemcitabine cisplatin , know active agent urothelial tumor . Gemcitabine may synergistic DNA-damaging drug paclitaxel cisplatin antagonize DNA repair . Investigators investigate combination Phase II study .</detailed_description>
