	<brief_title>Primary Prevention Stroke Children With SCD Sub-Saharan Africa II</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Strokes sickle cell anemia ( SCA ) , particularly child live Africa , associate significant morbidity increase risk premature death . In US , primary stroke prevention child SCA involve screen elevate transcranial Doppler ultrasound ( TCD ) velocity couple regular blood transfusion therapy elevate velocity . However , regular blood transfusion therapy feasible Africa due inadequate supply safe blood reluctance parent accept regular blood transfusion therapy child . Promising preliminary data feasibility trial Kano , Nigeria ( 1R21NS080639-NCE , NCT01801423 ; October 2012 - August 2014 ) support potential use moderate dose hydroxyurea ( HU ) therapy 20 mg/kg/day primary prevention stroke child SCA . In feasibility trial , screen 331 participant ; 92 % ( 25 27 ) participant elevate TCD measurement elect enroll receive HU therapy . About 75 % ( 210 280 ) screen participant non-elevated TCD measurement agree follow minimum three year assess background rate morbidity mortality . Among HU therapy , 80 % ( 20 25 ) participant reach third month HU therapy drop elevate TCD value 200 cm/sec middle cerebral artery . Based result recently complete Transcranial Doppler ( TCD ) With Transfusions Changing Hydroxyurea trial ( NCT01425307 ) , demonstrate child elevate TCD measurement switch HU therapy one year blood transfusion , couple preliminary trial result indicate decrease TCD velocities 2/3rds participant 3 month , propose three center randomize partial double-blind Phase III clinical trial ( 1R01NS094041-01 ; September 2015 - July 2020 ) test follow hypothesis : There 66 % relative risk reduction primary stroke child SCA , elevate TCD measurement ( n=220 ) , randomly allocate moderate dose vs. low dose HU therapy ( 10 vs. 20 mg/kg/day ) 3 year . The aim randomize partial double-blind Phase III clinical trial : 1 ) determine efficacy moderate vs. low dose HU therapy primary stroke prevention ; 2 ) determine efficacy moderate dose HU therapy decrease incidence cause-hospitalization cause ( pain , acute chest syndrome , infection , ) compare low dose HU therapy ; 3 ) ass long-term safety HU therapy ( mean 6.5 year ) participant feasibility trial elevate TCD measurement ( n=25 ) , compare child initial normal TCD ( n= 210 , follow least 3 year ) . In preparation application , team Nigeria receive 1 month patient-oriented research training Vanderbilt University School Medicine . This trial help u determine whether moderate dose HU therapy prevent thousand stroke child high risk Africa , simultaneously help build research capacity among next cadre physician scientist Nigeria .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion initial screen inclusive CBC : 1 . Patients hemoglobin SS SB0 thalassemia , S variant baseline hemoglobin le 10 g/dL sickle cell syndrome apart SC confirm hemoglobin electrophoresis , HPLC , IEF ; 2 . Informed consent parent legal guardian assent participant age 5 12 ( best estimate prepuberty , date birth document , frequent event region Nigeria , use pediatrician best estimate patient must prepubertal ) ; 3 . Patient must 5 12 year age ( i.e. , must attain 5th 13th birthday consent assent sign , best estimate base absence documentation . For patient use July 1st postulate birth year birth date ) . Inclusion criterion continuance study screen determine eligibility study therapy : 1 . Hemoglobin great 6.0 g/dL base initial CBC complete study consent obtain screening , neurological evaluation TCD measurement do . Participants continue study screen neurological evaluation evidence stroke , TCD complete . Exclusion Criteria screening : 1 . Prior overt stroke ( focal neurological deficit acute onset ) history , focal neurological deficit standardize neurological examination , concern moderate severe neurological deficit ( could due stroke ) base positive `` 10 question '' screening ( establish tool resource poor country ) .1,2 A `` positive '' screening define answer yes one 10 question . The negative predictive value ( child moderate several neurological impairment ) `` 10 question '' great 94 % child ; 1 2 . Other exclusion : significant cytopenia [ absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &lt; 1.5 X 109/L , /µl , platelets &lt; 150,000/µl , reticulocytes &lt; 80,000/µl , unless Hb &gt; 9 g/dl ] , renal insufficiency ( creatinine &gt; 0.8 mg/dl ) ; 3 . Patients currently receive hydroxyurea therapy consideration prior study consent/education ; 4 . Patients previously treat hydroxyurea consider restart hydroxyurea therapy ; 5 . Other chronic comorbid disease asthma ; 6 . History seizures diagnosis epilepsy ; 7 . Any condition illness , opinion site 's Principal Investigator ( PI ) make participation illadvised unsafe ; 8 . Participants child bear age pregnant may become pregnant take hydroxyurea . If participant becomes pregnant study , hydroxyurea therapy stop immediately . The onsite notify Coordinating Center principal investigator case . The site principal investigator study principal investigator determine therapy participant receive pregnancy standard care ; 9 . Hemoglobin le 6.0 g/dL base initial CBC complete study consent obtain screening , TCD measurement do . These patient exclude evidence TCD correlate anemia . Children low hemoglobin level less 6.0 g/dL likely nutritional deficiency likely iron correct supplementation . Inclusion Criteria participant eligible receive hydroxyurea therapy , willing follow minimum three year nonelevated TCD group : 1 . Successful completion screening procedure inclusive cerebral blood flow velocity less equal 199 cm/sec terminal portion internal carotid , middle cerebral artery , vessel ; 2 . Informed consent parent legal guardian assent participant ; 3 . Acceptance follow minimum three year study . Hydroxyurea may give reason part participant 's ongoing care , give part study ( SPRING Trial ) , unless annual TCD read meet criterion elevate TCD measurement base eligibility criterion study therapy . Inclusion Criteria participant randomize hydroxyurea therapy 36 month : 1 . Successful completion screening procedure inclusive cerebral blood flow velocity great equal 200 cm/sec measure twice least one measurement great equal 220 cm/sec middle cerebral artery , internal carotid , vessel nonimaging imaging technique great equal 180 cm/sec middle cerebral artery nonimaging image technique perform two study personnel ; If participant elevate TCD level ( great equal 200 cm/sec two consecutive measurement single measurement great equal 220 cm/sec ) , offer blood transfusion first , standard care clinical site . If participant family elect receive blood transfusion , invite participate study . 2 . Informed consent parent legal guardian study therapy assent participant complete ; 3 .
