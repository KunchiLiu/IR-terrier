	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well cisplatin fluorouracil work compare carboplatin paclitaxel treat patient anal cancer remove surgery , come back near place primary tumor , spread place body . Drugs use chemotherapy , cisplatin , fluorouracil , carboplatin paclitaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . It yet know whether cisplatin fluorouracil effective carboplatin paclitaxel treat anal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cisplatin Fluorouracil Compared With Carboplatin Paclitaxel Treating Patients With Inoperable Locally Recurrent Metastatic Anal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate best overall response rate ( ORR ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Overall survival ( OS ) . II . Progression free survival ( PFS ) . III . Disease control rate ( DCR ) ( stable disease [ SD ] well ) 12 24 week . IV . Best ORR non-irradiated lesion . V. Anti-tumor activity magnitude response capture waterfall plot analysis . VI . Toxicity . VII . Quality life ( QOL ) . VIII . Feasibility conduct multicenter international study squamous cell carcinoma anus ( SCCA ) recruit within reasonable time frame . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I. Explorative biomarker analysis . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM A : Patients receive cisplatin intravenously ( IV ) 1-4 hour day 1 fluorouracil IV continuously 24 hour day 1-4 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 8 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients complication associated central venous access prevent infusion fluorouracil discussion Chief Investigator may receive capecitabine twice daily ( BID ) day 1-4 . ARM B : Patients receive paclitaxel IV 1 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 carboplatin IV 30-60 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day every 12 week .</detailed_description>
