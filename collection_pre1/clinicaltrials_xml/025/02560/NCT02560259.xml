	<brief_title>The Role Referred Pain From Retro Trochanteric Region Patients With Knee Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Knee pain great problem society . Besides obvious know cause , increase understanding way treat , still rather large group patient symptoms easily understood harder treat . This group often characterize symptom range month year , see several physician , go several x-rays/mriÂ´s , various treatment help . The investigator find ever suspicion towards specific mechanism hip region source knee pain . It well know pediatric medicine child serious disease hip often debut knee pain . This relationship well establish adult . Pain low extremity arise inflammation strain retro trochanteric muscle , and/or indirectly process impact sciatic nerve . The late explanation commonly know piriformis syndrome . Professor Oddmund Johansen study type pain extensively . In late year find interest patient knee pain . These patient often pain deep palpation posterior hip region , tighten hip rotators flexion adduction , often respond pain relief , within minute , local anesthesia place distal attachment hip rotators posterior margin great trochanter . Afterwards , last pain relief see specify stretch regiment muscle . The investigator recruit suit patient knee referral list . Inclusion base clinical examination whether respond injection . After inclusion score pain quality life form , randomise two group , one stretching regime one conservative symptomatic treatment . There interest define quantify sub group knee patient . They follow 3 month , new examination score evaluate effect intervention . The study examine patient react comply propose diagnosis treatment . A cost analysis also consider .</detailed_description>
