	<brief_title>High Deductible Health Plans Bipolar Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bipolar disorder severe mental illness affect 3 % U.S. population cause personal suffering , morbidity , premature mortality . Continuous access medication , close monitoring , psychiatric care crucial avoid complication bipolar disorder relapse , hospitalization , suicide . To control rise cost , payer employer increasingly adopt high-deductible health plan ( HDHPs ) high out-of-pocket payment . Federally-defined Health Savings Account HDHPs require full cost-sharing non-preventive service , include medication specialist visit ; family deductibles HSA-HDHPs range $ 2,500 $ 12,700 . Enrollment HDHPs quadruple nationally 2006 2013 38 % worker . Analysts expect explosive growth continue health care cost pressure family employer . Well-informed patient HDHPs might reduce use unnecessary service expensive treatment option . However , patient might also choose forego need care . There little evidence particularly vulnerable patient bipolar disorder chronic mental illness fare forced make complex choice spend care HDHPs . Given rapid escalation , urgent need understand vulnerable patient change pattern care medication adherence HDHPs . We compare patient three type insurance : traditional plan low deductible ; HDHPs chronic medication pay fully out-of-pocket deductible met ; HDHPs medication subject co-pays traditional plan . OBJECTIVES : Using ten year data large U.S. commercial health insurer ( ~70 million member 50 state ) , assess impact HDHPs key outcome patient bipolar disorder experience employer-mandated shift traditional insurance HDHPs . Our specific aim evaluate : ( 1 ) change medication adherence , intensity quality health care ; ( 2 ) change adverse event ; , ( 3 ) change patient out-of-pocket cost . We compare outcome differ patient HDHPs without medication subject deductible . We assess effect overall population patient bipolar illness specific vulnerable subgroup , include racial/ethnic minority , poor patient , rural patient , patient important comorbidities . METHODS : We take advantage ongoing natural experiment whereby employer shift employee traditional insurance HDHPs . We use strong quasi-experimental , longitudinal method available compare experience patient switch employer HDHPs contemporaneous patient whose employer remain traditional plan . A major advantage approach inclusion employer whose employee choice insurance plan , minimize member-level selection bias . From preliminary data query , estimate study population ~160,000 member bipolar disorder 2004-2013 . Our data include detailed information insurance type , diagnosis , health service pharmacy utilization , out-of-pocket payment , individual-level patient characteristic like income , neighborhood-level factor like racial density . The unprecedented large sample size allow u answer question patient particular vulnerable subgroup respond HDHPs , include patient Black Hispanic , low income , reside rural area , major comorbidities . PATIENT OUTCOMES : Our Aim 1 measure quality bipolar treatment include indicator patient ' access appropriate care : prevalence intensity use effective medication ( antipsychotic , anticonvulsant ) ; medication adherence ; , guideline-recommended clinical monitoring ( regular outpatient mental health visit ) . Adverse event Aim 2 include psychiatric hospitalization , potentially avoidable often view indicator suboptimal outpatient care . In Aim 3 , ass change HDHPs co-payment amount face patient specific medical service , prescription fill clinician visit , total burden patient out-of-pocket cost . PATIENT AND STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT : Our longstanding engagement National Alliance Mental Illness ( NAMI , preeminent patient advocacy organization address issue around bipolar disorder ) shape study aim focus measurable outcome particular concern patient . We solicit regular input local patient family advisory panel ( assembled NAMI 's assistance ) refinement method , interpretation study finding , shape recommendation , dissemination result . As study consultant , NAMI Medical Director Dr. Ken Duckworth guide meeting patient panel contribute perspectives broad community patient clinicians deal bipolar illness . Dr. Greg Simon , Director US Mental Health Research Network , provide national expertise patient experience serious mental illness health plan . ANTICIPATED IMPACT : Our research provide empirical data compare patient bipolar illness fare three insurance design vastly different requirement cost-sharing . At time HDHP enrollment exploding , experience patient serious mental illness largely unexamined . Advocacy group able use finding lobby patient-responsive benefit design ; policymakers evidence redesign insurance benefit well address need vulnerable patient ( e.g. , exempt mood stabilize agent deductible ) .</detailed_description>
