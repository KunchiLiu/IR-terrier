	<detailed_description>Screening colorectal cancer introduce many country worldwide , still considerable uncertainty ideal modality . Population base trial guaiac faecal occult blood testing ( gFOBT ) consistently demonstrate significant reduction disease specific mortality three randomise population base trial biennial gFOBT demonstrate reduction death colorectal cancer around 16 % . As result trial , demonstration pilot perform United Kingdom lead introduction gFOBT screen four country United Kingdom . However , gFOBT significant limitation . It clear form screening associate substantial interval cancer rate region 50 % , indicate severe deficiency sensitivity cancer . Furthermore , well establish majority colorectal cancer arise pre-existing adenoma , important colorectal screen programme detect adenoma order reduce incidence disease well associate mortality . Although gFOBT detect adenoma , randomised study demonstrate reduction colorectal cancer incidence exception Minnesota Study use rehydrated gFOBT result high positivity rate large number colonoscopy . It borne mind however , new faecal immunochemical test ( FIT ) , , unlike gFOBT , specific human haemoglobin , perform good term cancer adenoma detection . It also interest recent scrutiny interval cancer data Scottish demonstration pilot clearly demonstrate gFOBT screen tend under-detect cancer woman compare men . In addition , relatively insensitive rectal cancer compare colon cancer . Analysis quantitative FIT data laboratory part evaluation FIT first line test Scotland , show mean faecal haemoglobin concentration woman low men , cutoff value require woman give 2 % positivity rate ( similar achieve gFOBT currently use UK ) less half men . Thus , gender least , FIT limitation gFOBT . In recent randomised trial carry 14 UK centre , single flexible sigmoidoscopy ( FS ) age 55 65 year show bring significant reduction colorectal cancer mortality . In addition , importantly , period four year significant reduction colorectal cancer incidence observe , presumably result routine removal adenoma FS . Interestingly , reduction incidence restrict left-sided cancer despite fact total colonoscopy carry significant index lesion find FS ( 5 % screened population ) . FS suffer low specificity since false positive occur , independent evidence sensitive single gFOBT FIT . In addition , FS ideally suit detect rectal cancer adenomas , unlikely would gender difference sensitivity . This landmark study ( henceforth refer `` UK FS trial '' ) , however , efficacy study since carry population already indicated interest participating , result , uptake randomise FS impressive 71 % . This , however , leave significant question surround introduction FS screening , clear would perform population screen tool . Extrapolation result FS trial general population would suggest uptake region around 30 % although clear uptake FS would Scottish population , data Glasgow centre participate FS indicate likely uptake 24 % . This compare overall uptake around 60 % current Scottish Bowel Screening Programme base gFOBT . A population base randomised trial FS Norway achieve participation rate 67 % randomise study The Netherlands achieve uptake 32.4 % FS compare 49.5 % 61.5 % gFOBT FIT respectively . In addition , evidence participant perceive personal burden FS great either type faecal testing . On hand , study Italy find similar participation rate FIT FS , although low 32 % invite . Two small study conduct London area observe uptake screening FS around 50 % similar study carry Tayside , Scotland achieve uptake 24 % . It clear discrepancy uptake FS , cultural issue difference level deprivation likely important . The randomised study The Netherlands demonstrate diagnostic yield advance neoplasia ( cancer significant adenoma ) per 100 invitee great FS either faecal test suggest overall performance FS may better faecal test despite low participation rate . This introduce important ethical dimension ; namely , whether acceptable use population screen tool reach relatively small proportion population rather test associate high participation rate overall poor performance term disease detection . This complicated adverse effect deprivation uptake screening . It known , Scotland , difference uptake gFOBT population screen deprive least deprived quintile around 20 % . The effect deprivation uptake FS population screen know , although UK FS trial 16 % difference intention participate 20 % difference actual uptake invite least deprived quartile Glasgow . In recent re-appraisal option colorectal cancer screening commission UK National Screening Committee , base UK FS trial , data first two round English Bowel Screening Programme data sensitivity specificity FIT , model suggest single FS would perform good biennial gFOBT FS age 62 result great reduction CRC incidence , CRC mortality CRC treatment cost , whereas FS age 54 result great gain life year QALYs . In addition suggest biennial FIT may outperform biennial gFOBT one FS . As result , FS screen introduce England age 55 . Thus offer 5 year gFOBT screening start , offer age 60 74 . In Scotland , however , age range gFOBT screen 50 74 , main issue surround introduction FS screen Scotland information regard utility FS population already expose FOBT screen . Nevertheless , give high degree efficacy FS screening , particularly term disease prevention via adenoma detection , relatively high participation associate gFOBT screen potential detect proximal cancer , hypothesise offer combination approach would provide enhance screen algorithm would associate good outcome either modality alone . In order test hypothesis answer key unresolved question around FS , necessary carry pilot FS screening integrate current faecal test-based Scottish Screening Programme , maximise information pilot propose carry random evaluation . It also propose FS offer around age 60 , appear age adenoma prevalence peak , therefore age adenoma detection removal likely confer maximum benefit . There also evidence gFOBT pilot 80 % interval cancer diagnose age 60 . As Scottish Bowel Screening Programme offer gFOBT age 50 , screen start Grampian , Tayside Fife 2000 part UK demonstration screen pilot , carry study area demonstrate whether FS add value mature biennial FOBT screening programme . Further evaluation Greater Glasgow test FS challenge Health Board area high urban deprivation . We seek establish value feasibility flexible sigmoidoscopy population expose gFOBT screening colorectal cancer . In way possible estimate add value add FS FOBT programme . This inform structure Scottish Bowel Screening Programme provide information international implication . It also possible estimate practicality introduce flexible sigmoidoscopy Scottish population background ongoing gFOBT screening .</detailed_description>
