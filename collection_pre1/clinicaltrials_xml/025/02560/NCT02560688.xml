	<brief_summary>This study conduct test hypothesis coadministration clopidogrel DS-1040b safe well tolerate . Subjects enter study initially receive single 12 hour infusion DS-1040b , generate data effect DS-1040b alone . After wash-out period ( ensure DS-1040b leave blood ) subject receive repeat clopidogrel dose 5 day generate data effect clopidogrel alone . On sixth day subject receive DS-1040b clopidogrel , effect compare two treatment give alone .</brief_summary>
