	<detailed_description>This clinical registry establish collect de-identified information rare disease . The registry create assimilation de- identify coded patient data centralize information use improve management many complication disease treatment . This study focus collection clinically biologically meaningful endpoint across multiple institution ; , focus specific set hypothesis collect data facilitate analysis . The investigator collect information relate symptom clinical course disease , complication disease treatment , presence minimal residual disease , frequency relapse subsequent management , data novel molecular marker associate prognosis . In conjunction Dr. Philip Payne , Chairman Department Bioinformatics The Ohio State University , investigator create system safeguard confidentiality identity patient agree participate research registry . Each participate institution responsible de-identification data , use software develop The Ohio State University , Department Biomedical Informatics , use registry . Each institution confidentially maintain code link information individual patient . Each participate institution direct control data contain registry associate respective patient population , house locally ( participate institution ) replicate central location . As result measure , patient wish withdraw registry , responsible institution able immediately remove record related patient registry</detailed_description>
