	<brief_summary>The aim study analyze case human epidermal growth factor receptor ( HER ) 2-positive metastatic breast cancer ( MBC ) last 10 year University Hospital Zurich ass efficacy treatment trastuzumab HER2-positive MBC find association different variable outcome . The aim find probable prognostic factor pattern disease progression . Prognostic factor could optimize treatment approach result delay disease progression .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Long-term Outcome HER2-amplified Metastatic Breast Cancer : A Retrospective Analysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Human epidermal growth factor ( HER2 ) receptor tyrosine kinase regulate diverse function normal cell growth , differentiation survival cell . In 25-30 per cent breast cancer HER2 gene amplify , result abnormally high level encode HER2 protein malignant cell . Overexpression amplification HER2 associate aggressive form breast cancer see significantly shorten disease-free survival overall survival . Trastuzumab , humanize monoclonal antibody extracellular domain HER2 , inhibit growth breast tumor cell receptor internalization , inhibition cell-cycle progression recruitment immune-effector cell . Trastuzumab , first anti-HER2 therapy , approve since 1998 United States since 2000 European country treatment HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer ( MBC ) . Single therapy well combination chemotherapy significantly improve outcome woman . Shown long time disease progression , long duration response , low rate death 1 year , long survival 20 per cent reduction risk death . But still little known long-term outcome pattern disease progression HER2-positive MBC . A case report show prolonged complete remission HER2-positive MBC anti-HER2 treatment ( trastuzumab , T-DM1 , pertuzumab ) . These case common characteristic negative hormone receptor status metastasis live . Another hypothesis bad prognosis patient early development CNS metastasis .</detailed_description>
