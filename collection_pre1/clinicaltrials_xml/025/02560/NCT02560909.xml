	<brief_summary>Influenza virus important cause morbidity transplant population lead viral bacterial pneumonia . Although annual influenza vaccine recommend transplant patient , study show nonadjuvanted vaccine poor immunogenicity . There study define effect adjuvanted vaccine population . The purpose study determine vaccination FLUAD® result improve immunogenicity compare standard vaccine allo-HSCT recipient . Immunogenicity assess standard quantitative antibody titer assessment use cell-mediated immunity measurement .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adjuvanted Influenza Vaccine Stem Cell Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator plan study immunogenicity two different type influenza vaccine 240 allogeneic stem cell transplant patient 2015-2016 season . Patients randomize receive either adjuvanted influenza vaccine nonadjuvanted . Antibody titer evaluate standard hemagglutination inhibition assay . The investigator hypothesize patient receive adjuvanted influenza vaccine reach significantly high response vaccine . This study advance research prevention serious viral infection transplant recipient . Results study potential directly improve patient care . If use adjuvanted influenza vaccine successful , strategy may lead significant reduction burden disease , hospitalization , long-term morbidity . The co-administration vaccine adjuvant potentially promising method boost immunogenicity . Two adjuvant use influenza vaccine : AS03 MF59 . Both oil-in-water emulsion . AS03 use monovalent pandemic A/H1N1 vaccine Canada Europe . Adjuvanted vaccine study hematopoietic stem cell transplant population study do use AS03-adjuvanted pandemic vaccine . MF59 adjuvant use seasonal influenza vaccine Canada Europe people ≥65 year old . MF59-adjuvanted vaccine well study hematopoietic stem cell transplantation could represent significant advance show great immunogenicity standard non-adjuvanted influenza vaccine . Both FLUAD® standard 2015-2016 nonadjuvanted vaccine contain 15 microgram antigen strain injected standard dose ( 0.5 mL ) deltoid muscle train personnel .</detailed_description>
