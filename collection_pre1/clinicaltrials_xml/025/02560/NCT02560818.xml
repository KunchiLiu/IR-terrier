	<brief_summary>This case-control study molecular diagnostics . This study require two step : - The first part study conduct population 10 woman without breast cancer , ovarian family ( Healthy Volunteers control ) - The second part study conduct population 50 patient predispose familial breast , ovarian cancer compare 10 control . For analysis leucocytes patient , blood sample collect prior study ( EXSAL study , ID-RCB 2009-A00833-54 ) use .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study require two step : - The first part study conduct population 10 woman free breast cancer , ovarian Family ( healthy volunteer control ) without know family history breast ovarian cancer . Mapping level blood ( leukocyte ) breast tissue draw individual physiological profile splice messenger RNA gene involve predisposition , target high-throughput sequencing RNA ( RNASeq ) . A direct comparison RNA splice pattern blood breast tissue witness detect difference two tissue . -The second part study conduct population 50 patient predispose familial breast , ovarian cancer compare 10 control know family history breast , ovarian cancer . Analysis result highlight potential splicing abnormality .</detailed_description>
