	<brief_summary>Introduction : Kinesio tap consists attachment thin elastic tape specific muscle , thickness similar epidermis . This tape stretch 140 % original length , demonstrate great elasticity comparison conventional bandage . According creator method , Kinesio tap lead well muscle activation inhibition , reduces pain , swell muscle spasm prevents muscle injury . Objective : The aim propose study compare analyze immediate effect Kinesio tap placebo tap performance unilateral vertical jump two hop test young professional soccer player . Methods : A randomized , placebo-controlled , double-blind , clinical trial conduct involve 100 athlete . The volunteer submit evaluation dominant lower limb use Single Leg Hop Test Single Leg Triple Hop Test well evaluation unilateral vertical jump pressure platform . The athlete randomly allocate two group . Group A receive Kinesio tap triceps surae muscle describe Kase ( 2003 , 2013 ) Group B receive placebo tap muscle . After 30 minute , volunteer submit evaluation test . Analysis : Intra-group inter-group analysis result perform . Statistical test conduct consider 5 % significance level .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Evaluation procedures The consolidated standard report trial ( CONSORT ) use propose randomized clinical trial . Personal data collect use chart design author . This chart contain follow information : name , date birth , dominant limb , weight height . Weight height determine use digital scale ( Worker® ) stadiometer ( Sanny® ) , respectively . The dominant limb record base volunteer 's answer question regard leg would use penalty kick . The BMI calculate base weight height . Individuals BMI great 25 Kg/m2 less 20 Kg/m² exclude standardize sample . All volunteer undergo follow evaluation : • Unilateral vertical jump : The unilateral vertical jump use measure performance , movement require triceps surae strength [ 9 ] . The vertical jump evaluate use pressure plate ( BIOMEC 400 v1.1® EMG Systems Brasil ) connect computer ( Inter Core 2 Dual® ) 2 GHz 250 Giga byte . This system quantify distribution vertical ground reaction force static dynamic position sample frequency 40 Hz use four force sensor ( two anterior two posterior ) capable support 150 Kg . Each sensor store analog data , amplify convert digital data interpret use Biomec 400® software program ( EMG Systems Brasil ) . This system record distribution force among four point change body sway anteroposterior ( Y axis ) mediolateral ( X axis ) direction . The force plate position even surface . Levelness determine two level attach extremity force plate . The volunteer instruct stand dominant leg hand hip jump high possible , landing leg . Initially , three jump perform familiarize volunteer procedure , one-minute rest interval jump . After two-minute rest interval , three additional jump perform one-minute rest interval jump , consider evaluation . Jump time determine use follow formula : h = jump height meter , = jump time second g = acceleration gravity ( 9.81 m/s2 ) . - Single Leg Hop Test Test commonly use measure functional performance progression lower limb rehabilitation program [ 10,11,12 ] , distance achieve single , one-foot hop record [ 11 ] . For , athlete stand dominant leg behind line mark floor hop far possible without use contralateral leg without lose balance . The distance measure metric tape line mark floor proximal point heel land floor end hop . The volunteer instruct keep hand hip throughout test reduce influence upper limb performance hop test . Initially , three hop perform familiarize volunteer procedure , one-minute rest interval hop . After two-minute rest interval , three additional hop perform one-minute rest interval hop , consider evaluation . - Single Leg Triple Hop Test The volunteer also position dominant leg behind line mark floor perform three consecutive hop far possible without use contralateral leg without lose balance . The final distance measure metric tape line mark floor proximal point heel land floor end third hop . The volunteer instruct keep hand hip throughout test reduce influence upper limb performance hop test . On hop test , land must make stable fashion without touch contralateral leg upper limbs floor hop consider valid .</detailed_description>
