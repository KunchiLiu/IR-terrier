	<brief_summary>The goal Model System Program expand upon advance finding outcomes previous current Model Systems clinical research , continue develop study effectiveness innovative treatment strategy person spinal cord injury ( SCI ) ; evaluate benefit well-designed , comprehensive , coordinate , interdisciplinary continuum care lead improve outcomes person SCI . In order achieve goal , follow objective Midwest Regional Spinal Cord Injury Care System ( MRSCICS ) model system grant proposal accomplish .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Development Low Cost Devices Increase Access Treadmill Training</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator develop assess use spring-loaded device assist limb swing forward propulsion body weight support treadmill training ( BWSTT ) ( Aim 1 ) . Prototype model device develop . These device : 1. simple use clinical setting ; 2. easily adjustable alter assistance provide ; , 3. able quantify amount assistance necessary facilitate normal step pattern . The investigator also evaluate short- long-term adaptation locomotor performance follow BWSTT individual incomplete SCI use device . This information identify effect variable assistance limb trunk modulate muscle activity and/or motor performance ( kinematics ) step maximize walking recovery .</detailed_description>
