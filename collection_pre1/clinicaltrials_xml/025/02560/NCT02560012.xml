	<brief_summary>This subject metastatic Renal Cell Cancer ( RCC ) . There four Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve drug first-line therapy Renal Cell Cancer ( RCC ) two second-line therapy . Each drug target specific molecular pathway . At present oncologist select therapy base current guideline . There new method try use biomarker information subject 's tumor select best drug treat subject . This process investigational , study do . Biomarkers gene , protein molecule affect cancer cell grow , multiply , die respond compound body . These biomarkers build tumor profile `` fingerprint '' subject 's tumor . A new focus cancer care personalize treatment , doctor select drug base subject 's tumor 's unique `` fingerprint '' likely effective fight tumor . Selecting treatment subject likely respond require thorough understand relationship biomarker treatment effect . The PI want gather data understand relationship help treat future cancer patient . The purpose study evaluate efficacy treatment select base tumor profile .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective , one-arm , proof concept study design evaluate efficacy algorithm-based allocation ( base genomic/proteomic profile ) first-line therapy renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) . After eligibility review , patient receive one four first-line therapy agent base tumor 's molecular profile determine use fresh biopsy tissue accessible metastatic site . Upon disease progression , patient receive one two second-line agent base tumor 's molecular profile . Because proof-of-concept study , sample size base feasibility accrual . The clinic able recruit 100 patient within reasonable timeframe study . The number patient receive drug vary base frequency molecular alteration population . Therefore , group compare one another - research goal determine whether progression-free survival ( PFS ) drug improve PFS report FDA approval trial drug assign base molecular analysis .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects may include study meet follow inclusion criterion : Pathologically confirm renal cell carcinoma . No prior systemic and/or investigative therapy kind . Patients primary tumor place strongly encourage undergo nephrectomy prior initiation study agent . Prior palliative radiotherapy metastatic lesion ( ) permit . Patient must adequately recover acute toxicity treatment . All major surgery type and/or radiotherapy must complete least 4 week prior registration . Must progressive metastatic disease ECOG performance status ≤2 Women childbearing potential male patient must use acceptable method contraception—tubal ligation , vasectomy , barrier contraceptive spermicide—while study 3 month last dose study therapy . Oral , implantable , injectable contraceptive may affect cytochrome P450 interaction , therefore consider effective study . Age ≥18 year Required Initial Laboratory Values : Granulocytes ≥1,500/µL Platelet Count ≥100,000/µL Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL AST/ALT ≤ 2.5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) Alk . Phos.≤ 2.5 x ULN Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN Amylase/Lipase within normal range Urinalysis≤ 1+ protein T3T4 TSH within normal range Pregnancy test woman Negative Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN Electrocardiogram ( ECG ) active ischemia Echocardiogram ejection fraction ≥40 % Pulmonary function test Fasting serum cholesterol ≤300 mg/dL OR ≤7.75 mmol/L AND fast triglyceride ≤2.5 x ULN . NOTE : In case one threshold exceed , patient include initiation appropriate lipid lower medication . Signed informed consent prior performance studyspecific procedure Ongoing hemoptysis , cerebrovascular accident within 12 month prior study entry , peripheral vascular disease claudication occur upon walk less one city block , history clinically significant bleeding . Deep venous thrombosis pulmonary embolus within 12 month prior study entry ongoing need fulldose oral parenteral anticoagulation . For maintenance catheter patency daily prophylactic aspirin lowdose coumadin ( 12 mg ) allow . Evidence current central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases . All patient must undergo CT scan brain ( contrast , possible ) within 42 day prior registration . Any imaging abnormality indicative active CNS metastasis exclude patient study . Significant cardiovascular disease define congestive heart failure ( New York Heart Association Class II , II IV ) angina pectoris require nitrate therapy , recent myocardial infarction ( within precede 6 month prior study entry ) . Uncontrolled hypertension ( define blood pressure ≥160 mmHg systolic and/or ≥90 mmHg diastolic medication ) . Document 48 hour minimum 3 reading . Ongoing requirement systemic corticosteroid therapy ( except replacement therapy adrenal insufficiency ) immunosuppressant permit . Topical and/or inhale steroid allow .</criteria>
