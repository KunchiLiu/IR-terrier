	<brief_title>Why Does Acute Post Whiplash Injury Pain Transform Into Chronic Pain ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background The propose study aim explore acute pain turn , patient , chronic pain , develop tool prediction transition . Based clinical psychological assessment along psychophysical neurophysiological assessment pain perception , analysis connectivity several brain center relevant pain processing , together pain genetics , expect develop tool , predict , individual patient acute pain inflict whiplash injury , chance him/her go chronic pain situation . Further , know dysfunction pain process patient , possible offer treatment high chance succeed . Our specific aim evaluate , setup acute whiplash injury , risk transition chronic pain base follow test domain : ( ) Psychophysical neurophysiological data describe facilitatory inhibitory modulation capacity patient . ( ii ) Psychological data describe patient 's behavior catastrophyzing , fear pain , post-traumatic stress depress mood . ( iii ) Structural functional neuro-imaging data describe brain anatomy function , ass rest state MRI activity , grey matter property use T1 weight imaging , white matter property use diffusion tensor imaging . ( iv ) Genetic data describe genetic epidemiology every patient examination genetic variant associate transition chronic pain , ( v ) individual case data relate age , gender , education , socioeconomic parameter personal medical history , well feature specific injury . Overall , aim construct composite scoring system , base relevant mention parameter , yield high relative predictive value identify acute pain patient high risk chronification . Subjects One hundred twenty healthy subject ( range 20-79 ; 20 subject per age decade , 10 M 10 F ) participate first phase study aim collect normative data healthy population . Seven hundred fifty acute whiplash-injury base mild TBI participate study . Study design Phase I - Normative data collection inhibitory excitatory pain modulation response , study healthy subject Phase II - Multi-modal assessment acute mild TBI whiplash patient follow-up 1 . Initial experimental assessment , consist , case , two session , one ER visit , next within 72 hrs injury , pending team device availability , test complete , follow : 1 . Physical examination full neurological exam , assessment neck movement . 2 . Psychophysical pain measurement : . Pain threshold . ii . Suprathreshold pain magnitude estimation ; iii . Mechanical TS electrical TS iv . CPM - describe phase I protocol . It note similar protocol pain measurement commonly perform many lab worldwide many acute chronic pain setup , consider safe , damaging effect disease state . c. Psychological examination via fill questionnaire evaluation follow variable : . Pain Catastrophizing ii . Depression iii . Post-traumatic Diagnostic Scale ( PDS ) iv . Fear pain v. The perceived stress subject assess validated Hebrew version Cohen 's Perceived Stress Scale ( PSS ) . vi . Five factor model ( FFM ) d.Blood collection genetics . Whole blood sample ( 10cc ) collect subject place EDTA-coated tube . Genomic DNA isolate use DNA Extraction Kit . Quality quantity DNA sample measure use NanoDrop Machine . e. MRI/fMRI examination 3T scanner . f. Neurophysiological assessment pain modulation 64-channel EEG recording ( Brain Products GmbH , Munich , Germany ) CPM TS . i.Neurophysiological assessment CPM ii.Neurophysiololgical assessment TS base electrical evoked potential obtain constant current stimulator 2 . Follow Patients self-report pain level use analgesic two week . At 6 12 month visit patient invited repeat psychophysical neurophysiological pain assessment psychological questionnaire . Selected patient undergo second MRI assessment .</detailed_description>
