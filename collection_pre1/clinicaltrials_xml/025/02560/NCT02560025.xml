	<brief_summary>This research study study target therapy ( form treatment use drug substance identify attack specific type cancer cell less harm normal cell ) possible treatment high-risk acute myeloid leukemia . The name study intervention involve study : - Alisertib / MLN8237 - Cytarabine / Cytosine Arabinoside - Idarubicin / Idarubicin hydrochloride - Daunorubicin ( Can use place idarubicin )</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Trial Alisertib With Induction Chemotherapy High-risk AML</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study Phase II clinical trial . Phase II clinical trial test safety effectiveness investigational intervention learn whether intervention work treat specific disease . `` Investigational '' mean intervention study . As part research study , participant take alisertib combination conventional chemotherapy , idarubicin cytarabine . Alisertib approve FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) . However , cytarabine idarubicin approve FDA treatment AML . It also mean FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve give alisertib idarubicin cytarabine use participant , include participant type cancer . Earlier pre-clinical study clinical trial suggest alisertib may clinical promise single agent acute myeloid leukemia . Alisertib selective small molecule inhibitor Aurora A kinase , enzyme may play role survival leukemia cell . Alisertib study treatment advanced malignancy , include AML . Essentially , mean alisertib may work halt growth malignancy ( abnormal cell divide without control invade nearby tissue ) target mechanism . By combine alisertib standard chemotherapy , hope enhance efficacy current treatment use acute myeloid leukemia . An early study combination complete accrual , demonstrated regimen well tolerate . Through study , investigator would like determine addition alisertib standard 7+3 chemotherapy improve efficacy measure rate complete remission ( decreased disappearance sign symptom cancer ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must pathologically confirm , newly diagnose highrisk acute myeloid leukemia , define least one follow criterion Age great equal 65 year Poor risk karyotype , per Leukemianet criterion Antecedent underlie myelodysplastic syndrome myeloproliferative neoplasm AML MDSrelated change Adults , age 18 year old time diagnosis , eligible standard induction chemotherapy accord treat physician . ECOG performance status 02 ( Karnofsky ≥60 % , see Appendix A ) Left ventricular ejection fraction &gt; 50 % measure echocardiogram MUGA scan Must receive systemic antineoplastic therapy include radiation therapy within 14 day study enrollment , except hydroxyurea 6mercaptopurine purpose cytoreduction . Patients may also receive alltrans retinoic acid ( ATRA ) early suspicion acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL , M3AML ) , although confirm APL patient exclude study . Adequate renal function define : calculate creatinine clearance ≥40 mL/min ( CockcroftGualt Formula ) Direct bilirubin &lt; 2.0 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) , SGOT ( AST ) SGPT ( ALT ) &lt; 2.5 x ULN . AST and/or ALT may 5X ULN think secondary leukemia . The effect alisertib develop human fetus unknown . For reason chemotherapeutic agent know teratogenic , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Men treat enrol protocol must also agree use adequate contraception duration study participation , 6 month completion therapy . Subject must able take oral medication maintain fast require 2 hour 1 hour alisertib administration . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Patients exclude study otherwise fulfill criterion mention bullet 3.1.1 , find harbor `` intermediate '' `` favorable '' risk cytogenetics 41 : In patient , sample evaluate patient cytogenetics send time diagnosis per standard clinical care absence favorable intermediaterisk cytogenetics must confirm Day 8 . If cytogenetic analysis reveals patient harbor nonpoor risk cytogenetics , cytogenetic result receive prior Day 8 , participant remove study . Patients acute bilineal/biphenotypic leukemia Participants chemotherapy radiotherapy within 14 day prior enter study , except hydroxyurea 6MP note . Participants receive receive investigational agent within 14 day enrollment . Chemo , hormono , radio immunotherapy therapy monoclonal antibody small tyrosine kinase inhibitor within past 4 week prior treatment trial drug Persistence clinically relevant therapy relate toxicity previous anticancer therapy Prior allogeneic bone marrow organ transplantation Individuals history different malignancy ineligible except follow circumstance . Individuals history malignancy eligible diseasefree least 5 year deem investigator low risk recurrence malignancy . Individuals follow cancer eligible diagnose treat within past 5 year : cervical cancer situ , basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin . Current clinical central nervous system ( CNS ) symptom deem investigator related leukemic CNS involvement ( lumbar puncture require , clinical assessment per investigator 's judgment sufficient ) . If applicable , patient ≥Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy within 14 day enrollment Prior treatment alisertib Known history hepatitis C infection suspect currently active hepatitis C infection . Known suspected history hepatitis B infection exclude follow condition meet : Received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( either allogenic autologous ) , Received rituximabcontaining treatment regimen last 12 month enter study , Tested positive presence least 1 follow 3 marker blood ( evaluated screening ) : hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAG ) , antibodies hepatitis B core antigen ( antiHBc ) , hepatitis B viral load ( HBV DNA ) . Current history congestive heart failure New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) class 3 4 , history document diastolic systolic dysfunction ( LVEF &lt; 50 % , measure MUGA scan echocardiogram ) . Prior study entry , ECG abnormality screen document investigator medically relevant Known hypersensitivity trial drug contraindication standard `` 7+3 '' induction chemotherapy . Known history uncontrolled sleep apnea syndrome , sleep apnea require supplemental oxygen , condition could result excessive daytime sleepiness . A medical condition require use proton pump inhibitor ( PPIs ) ; histamine 2 ( H2 ) receptor antagonist . Patients intermittently use medication , must meet following criterion : No use PPIs within 5 day first dose alisertib No use H2 antagonist pancreatic enzyme within 24 hour first dose alisertib Patients mental deficit psychiatric condition preclude give inform consent follow protocol . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection require intravenous antibiotic , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Known GI disease GI procedure could interfere oral absorption tolerance alisertib . Examples include , limited partial gastrectomy , history small intestine surgery , celiac disease . Pregnant woman exclude study alisertib , along standard induction chemotherapy , carry potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother alisertib well cytarabine idarubicin , breastfeed avoid . Confirmation subject pregnant must establish negative serum ßhuman chorionic gonadotropin ( ßhCG ) pregnancy test result obtain screening . Pregnancy test require postmenopausal surgically sterilize woman . Although absolute exclusion criterion , know drugdrug interaction , issue consider enrollment : Treatment clinically significant enzymeinducing drug , include know Pglycoprotein inducer ( include St John 's wort rifampicin ) use absolutely necessary consider best available choice patient . If possible , recommended alternative know substrate , inhibitor inducer Pglycoprotein consider . Cases discuss principal investigator , may allow per his/her discretion . Patients psychological , familial , social , geographic factor otherwise preclude give informed consent , follow protocol , potentially hamper compliance study treatment followup . Patients otherwise felt unable comply protocol , opinion investigator .</criteria>
