	<brief_title>The Relation Between Renal Resistive Index Glomerular Hyper Filtration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Apart acute kiddney injury ( AKI ) , critically ill patient sepsis trauma also exhibit glomerular hyperfiltration ( 2-4 ) . Glomerular hyperfiltration easily recognize , decrease serum creatinine late manifestation generally interpret normal renal function . Glomerular hyperfiltration may clinical consequence , lead augment renal clearance water soluble drug . This especially relevant antibiotic , augment clearance lead underdosing therapeutic failure ( 5-9 ) . Patients glomerular hyperfiltration generally young patient less severe disease ( 3 ) often exhibit hyperdynamic circulation . The mechanism glomerular hyperfiltration poorly understood . High catecholamine release increase renal blood flow could play role . Direct measurement renal blood flow available daily clinical practice . Nowadays , investigator measure Renal Resistive Index ( RRI ) use renal Doppler ultrasound . The RRI sonographic index assess resistance intrarenal arcuate interlobar artery normally use assess renal arterial disease . The method become available bedside intensive care unit . RRI calculate : ( peak systolic velocity - end diastolic velocity ) /peak systolic velocity . Normal value 0.60 0.70 . A mean value 0.72 find critically ill patient admit intensive care unit ( personal data ) . The investigator hypothesize high glomerular filtration rate measure creatinine clearance associate low renal resistive index accelerate microvascular blood flow . To prove reject hypothesis , follow study measurement perform critically ill patient sepsis trauma : 1 . Renal ultrasound measure renal resistive index ( RRI ) After visualise kidney ultrasound mode , check ( chronic ) renal damage , arcuate interlobar artery localize three successive Doppler measurement different position kidney ( high , middle low ) perform . This repeat 3 time kidney . So total number 9 RRI value obtain kidney . 2 . Sublingual microcirculation use Sidestream Dark Field imaging ( SDF ) After removal secretion gauze , device apply tongue three sequence 20 second adjacent area record store . The investigator measure perfuse vessel density ( PVD ) , proportion perfuse vessel ( PPV ) microvascular flow index ( MFI ) small vessel . Each image divide four quadrant , predominant type flow ( 0 = absent , 1 = intermittent , 2 = sluggish , 3 = normal , 4 = high ) evaluate quadrant . The mean four quadrant use analysis . 3 . To assess fluid status , Bioelectrical impedance analysis ( BIA ) performedusing Akern BIA 101 device . BIA measure Resistance ( R ) Reactance ( Xc ) reflect extracellulair ( R ) cellular ( Xc ) resistance alternate current 400 Î¼A afrequency 50 kHz . In previous study investigator find ( change ) R highely correlation ( change ) fluid status .</detailed_description>
