	<brief_title>Chronic Lumbosacral Radiculopathy : Impact Analgesic Dietary Intervention Pain &amp; Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lumbar radiculopathy fairly common pain syndrome may result chronic , severe disability . There successful treatment option patient persistent lumbosacral radicular pain ( LRP ) respond conventional approach . A fundamental biologic mechanism chronic LRP , well chronic pain syndrome , may involve failure inflammation-resolution , active process drive lipid mediator derive fatty acid ( resolvins , protectins , maresins ) . The investigator ' preliminary study indicate dietary modification , specifically increase dietary fatty acid , reduce others , result large , statistically significant clinically relevant improvement headache frequency , intensity , clinical outcome community dwell person chronic headache . The propose trial represent promising approach treatment disable condition , lumbar radiculopathy . The previous headache trial investigator ' interdisciplinary UNC/NIH team demonstrate specific dietary manipulation produce marked biochemical change major positive clinical impact . This project promise enhance generalizability investigator ' approach expand chronic headache another common chronic pain condition , also use cost-effective intervention . Because dietary modification relatively safe low-cost health-improvement strategy , long-term outcome research may empower individual take active role health dietary change reduce dependence medical treatment , provide significant clinical benefit . Baseline Phase . Medical record obtain participant 's history physical examination ( perform refer physician Spine Center ) . The baseline visit consist review inclusion/exclusion criterion component study prior consenting . Those wish sign consent complete baseline assessment instrument measure lumbosacral radiculopathy characteristic impact quality-of-life . Through electronic diary , participant provide daily data pain intensity , duration , function , sleep quality , medication use 2-week baseline phase . Participants compliant aspect data collection , experience daily radicular pain , eligible study intervention participation . Randomization . At end 2-week baseline phase , participant qualify randomize ( computer-generated variable permute block ) : 1 ) High n-3 , Low n-6 Diet ( Analgesic Diet ) ; 2 ) Control Diet . Blood collect baseline biomarker assessment prior begin study diet . Post Randomization . After randomization , participant attend initial , in-depth dietary counseling session administer registered dietitian . Participants ask provide dietary history receive detail instruction specific dietary intervention per group assignment . Participants group attend total 3 in-person follow-up session dietitian , review dietary experience , receive encouragement , clarify issue , question answer . At visit , dietitian obtain dietary history assessment , provide tailor counseling , record data evaluation participant variability order guide future session . Participants visit dietitian randomization , two week later , 4 week , 6 week ( end intervention ) . In addition , individual participate brief ( 15-20 minute ) check-in telephone call dietitian every 2-3 week . Participants contact research assistant twice weekly encourage diary completion invite adverse event reporting . During 12-week intervention phase ( week 2-14 ) , participant provide essential food enable follow diet recommendation , include study oil , salad dressing , unprepared protein source ( meat , bean , fish ) . For remainder meal , participant choose food product consistent assign diet . At conclusion post-intervention phase ( Week 20 , Diet week 18 ) , participant complete on-line questionnaire provide blood sample . The purpose post-intervention phase : 1 ) obtain pilot data ability participant continue achieve nutrient intake target without counsel food provision ; 2 ) obtain pilot data post-intervention trajectory biochemical clinical outcome . Throughout 12-week active intervention 6-week post-intervention phase , participant access detail intervention material . Diet education material include diet guideline , allow food list , read food label , grocery shopping guide 9 local grocery store , din guide , 7-day meal plan 75 recipe ability dietitian add . Food Supply . Participants visit dietitian 3 time 12-week active intervention obtain specific food item target nutrient composition . Food item include : cooking oil , salad dressing , mayonnaise , portable dress packet , unprepared frozen food item , key ingredient home preparation meal snack . All food specifically select ensure participant meet specific nutrient intake target . Prior nutrient analysis 80 relevant food item perform part investigator ' previous dietary intervention study participant chronic daily headache , National Institutes Health-National Institute Alcohol Abuse Alcoholism Section Nutritional Neurosciences ( SNN ) . The SNN agree provide nutrient analysis need propose study . Assessments . Throughout 2-week baseline , 12-week active intervention , 6-week post-intervention phase , participant record pain intensity , pain interference , medication use , activity , stress use daily pain diary access mobile device . Blood sample collect three visit end baseline phase ( Week 2 , Diet week 0 ) study Weeks 14 20 ( end active intervention end post-intervention period ) nutritional metabolic biomarker measurement . At sample collection visit ( 6 week diet ) , participant also complete Oswestry Disability Index ( ODI ) NIH PROMIS-29 battery ( physical function , anxiety , depression , fatigue , sleep disturbance , satisfaction social role , pain interference , pain intensity ) . Every 6 week , participant also ask use modality pain control , include physical therapy , spinal manipulation , epidural corticosteroid injection , acupuncture , yoga . Interventions . All participant receive : 1 ) tailor dietitian-administered counseling consistent group assignment ; 2 ) access intervention-specific informational material daily outcome assessment ; 3 ) critical food item precisely quantify fatty acid composition , select meet nutrient intake target specific assignment group . Random Allocation . At first intervention visit , At Week 2 , research dietitian enter participant 's assign ID online computer program determine assignment one two diet . Using random number sequence generate permute block 2-4 , program ensures equal number participant arm . The program document treatment assignment un-editable form include date stamp . Masking . The research staff , mask treatment assignment , schedule study-related visit Clinical Translational Research Center ( CTRC ) appropriate site University North Carolina ( UNC ) Healthcare system medical school . Only dietitian , necessity , unmasked . All investigator laboratory personnel mask dietary assignment . Masking maintain random allocation procedure . The research dietitian indicate participant diet consider treatment diet vs. control diet .</detailed_description>
