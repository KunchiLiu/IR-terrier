	<brief_summary>Sirukumab fully human anti-interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) immunoglobulin G1-kappa high affinity specificity bind human IL-6 molecule may therapeutic benefit treatment giant cell arteritis ( GCA ) interruption multiple pathogenic pathway . Sirukumab inhibit IL-6-mediated signal transducer activator transcription 3 ( STAT3 ) phosphorylation , result inhibition biological effect IL-6 . This study evaluate efficacy safety sirukumab characterize benefit-to-risk profile sirukumab treatment active GCA . The study conduct 2 distinct part ( Part A Part B ) consist follow phase : Screening phase , Part A : 52-week double-blind treatment phase , Part B : 104-week extension phase option receive open-label sirukumab base disease status 16-week follow-up phase applicable . Approximately 204 subject diagnosis GCA active disease within 6 week baseline randomize Part A , 52-week double-blind treatment phase , receive one two dos sirukumab placebo , addition pre-specified prednisone taper . The efficacy safety sirukumab sustain remission assess Week 52 . Subjects complete Part A study eligible enter Part B , 104-week extension phase , design investigate long-term maintenance remission safety follow cessation sirukumab treatment ass long-term corticosteroid use . Subjects active GCA end Part A new onset GCA flare first 52 week Part B eligible receive open-label sirukumab . Subjects need follow-up safety evaluation least 16 week receive last dose study drug , applicable withdrawn prematurely study whose open-label sirukumab treatment Part B complete Week 88 .</brief_summary>

No evidence active latent infection Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( TB ) . Are pregnant breastfeeding . Recent ( within past 12 week ) plan major surgery would impact study procedure assessment . Organ transplantation recipient ( except cornea within 3 month prior baseline visit ) . Had prior treatment follow : Systemic immunosuppressive ) within 4 week baseline ; Biologic agent target reduce tumor necrosis factoralpha ( TNFalpha ) within 28 week baseline , depend agent ; Any prior use tocilizumab antiIL6 agent ; Bcell deplete agent ( eg , rituximab ) within 12 month prior baseline long B cell count return normal range baseline level ; Cytotoxic drug cyclophosphamide , chlorambucil , nitrogen mustard , alkylating agent within 4 week baseline ; Abatacept within 8 week baseline ; Tofacitinib within 4 week baseline ; Methotrexate use within 2 week baseline . Methylprednisolone &gt; 100 mg/day intravenous ( IV ) ( equivalent ) within 8 week baseline . History severe allergic reaction monoclonal antibody , human protein , excipients . Evidence serious concomitant disease , opinion investigator make unsuitable participation study . Major ischemic event , unrelated GCA , within 12 week screen . Marked baseline prolongation correct QT ( QTc ) interval &gt; = 450 millisecond ( msec ) ( QTc Bazett 's formula [ QTcB ] QTc Fridericia 's formula [ QTcF ] ) , history Torsade de Pointes , family history long QT syndrome , history second third degree heart block . Current liver disease could interfere trial History current active diverticulitis , inflammatory bowel disease , symptomatic gastrointestinal tract condition might predispose bowel perforation . History known demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis optic neuritis .
