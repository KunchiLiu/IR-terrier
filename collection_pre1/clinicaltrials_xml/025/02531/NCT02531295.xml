	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine safety bioactivity herbal supplement call `` kansui , '' contain several active ingredient ingenols may role help clear HIV body . Kansui use traditional Chinese medicine century treat various ailment eliminate excess fluid abdomen lung , loosen phlegm chest , relieve constipation . Based preliminary vitro data group , kansui extract powder potent activator HIV transpcription latently infect Jurkat cell . The investigator ' hypothesis kansui extract powder prepare tea safe well-tolerated , elicit vivo immunologic response , dos administer , increase HIV transcription latently-infected cell among HIV-infected patient suppressive antiretroviral therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immunologic Response Kansui Treated HIV+ Individuals : Dose Escalation Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Millions HIV-infected individual receive life-saving antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) . However , mortality remain high , particularly resource-limited country . Chronic HIV-infected individual demonstrate evidence persistent immune activation despite ART , independent predictor mortality set . Given current absence effective HIV vaccine , find cure HIV large impact long-term health treat HIV-infected individual . The key challenge HIV eradication strategy persistence small pool rest memory CD4+ T cell harbor latent replication-competent HIV , untouched current ART . One potential strategy eliminate reservoir `` shock kill '' approach latency reactivate agent ( LRAs ) use `` shock '' virus cell order host immune response , ART , and/or additional immunomodulatory agent kill virus-expressing cell . The goal current study evaluate safety vivo biological response herbal supplement use traditional Chinese medicine ( `` kansui ) '' potent vitro latency reactivate capability . Kansui inexpensive , readily available herbal supplement prescribe thousand year traditional Chinese medicine contains active compound ingenols show reverse latency animal model . A semi-synthetic form ingenol show potently reactivate latent simian immunodeficiency virus ( SIV ) rhesus macaque currently undergo early drug development . Though kansui study extensively traditional Chinese medicine , herbal supplement never evaluate biologic activity HIV disease use Western scientific research method . This pilot clinical trial generate preliminary result regard safety vivo biologic activity kansui . Promising result study may allow future large study evaluate efficacy non-pharmacologic agent treatment HIV disease .</detailed_description>
