	<brief_summary>Intratumoral plasmid IL-12 electroporation ( IT-pIL12-EP ) administer approximately 10 patient triple negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) cutaneous subcutaneous disease . Patients receive one complete cycle therapy , consist local injection plasmid IL-12 ( pIL-12 ) follow immediately electroporation ( EP ) , accessible tumor lesion . IT-pIL12-EP administered Days 1 , 5 , 8 single 28-day cycle .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Pharmacodynamic Effects IT-pIL12-EP Patients With TNBC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot study evaluate pharmacodynamic effect intratumoral injection pIL-12 follow immediately electroporation ( IT-pIL12-EP ) . A minimum ten patient biopsy-accessible triple negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) treat study . Additional patient , maximum 25 patient , may enrol base upon pharmacodynamic observation discretion Principal Investigator , consultation Sponsor . All patient receive single 28-day treatment cycle . One lesion remain untreated ( control lesion ) . Treatment administer Days 1,5 , 8 single 28-day cycle . Treatments consist direct injection pIL-12 tumor lesion , follow immediately electroporation lesion . At end treatment cycle , patient return clinic final safety evaluation tumor biopsy . This end study ( EOS ) visit occur prior initiate new anti-cancer therapy/regimen . All patient undergo tumor biopsy two separate timepoints molecular histological analysis associate primary endpoint . At least one lesion biopsied Screening ( pre-treatment sample ) . Biopsies untreated control lesion least one treated lesion obtain EOS visit ( post-treatment sample ) . Additional tumor biopsy sample may request either tumor regression progression prior EOS . Duration participation approximately 4 week patient . A patient consider complete study three IT-pIL12-EP treatment ( Days 1 , 5 , &amp; 8 ) require pre- post-treatment tumor biopsy obtain EOS safety follow-up evaluation perform .</detailed_description>
