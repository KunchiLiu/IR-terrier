	<detailed_description>The number emergency room visit constantly increase , therefore necessary minimize duration visit , thereby increase efficacy diagnostic process , lead quick orientation patient appropriate care . In context , accurate triage quick initial diagnostic work-up paramount importance achieve goal . Elderly people constitute large proportion emergency room patient , represent 12 % emergency room admission . The need diagnostic test therapeutic intervention much great patient population , 4 5 patient require measure . Indeed , elderly person often suffer multiple disease require great number test ( source : Direction de la recherche , des études , de l'évaluation et de statistiques ( DREES ) , emergency room survey ) ( 1 ) . Cardiovascular disease symptoms represent 12 % cause emergency room admission , patient suffer cardiovascular disease whose emergency room visit last long . Indeed , almost 50 % patient cardiovascular disease stay 4 hour emergency room , accord French national survey publish July 2014 . The diagnostic approach emergency room elderly patient admit acute dypsnoea complex , early identification acute left-sided heart failure ( ALSHF ) vital impact prognosis . Acute dyspnoea acute respiratory insufficiency frequent cause admission emergency room . The etiological diagnosis difficult , especially elderly patient often history cardio-respiratory disease ( 2 ) ( 3 ) ( 4 ) ( 5 ) . In specific population , often numerous comorbidities , chronic respiratory failure , chronic renal failure , ischemic heart disease ( 6 ) . In addition , acute respiratory insufficiency cause range distinct pathology , acute heart failure , pneumonia , exacerbation chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , pleural effusion pulmonary embolism . There thus clearly press need accurate early diagnosis correct etiology patient , particularly identify ALSHF , condition require immediate initiation appropriate therapy order improve prognosis . In patient , study show inappropriate delay therapy emergency room independent predictor death ( 2 ) ( 3 ) ( 7 ) . The European Society Cardiology ( ESC ) recently publish review standard diagnostic method ALSHF , describe advantage limitation ( clinical examination , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , chest x-ray , NT-proBNP assessment ) ( 8 ) . The clinical sign difficult interpret , non-specific , particularly acute phase elderly obese patient ( 9 ) . Indeed , author report 50 % diagnostic error elderly patient ( 10 ) . Chest x-ray , usually perform emergency room , specific condition perform emergency situation . Generally , pre-requisites proper implementation fully respect emergency nature exam , chest x-ray therefore primarily useful differential diagnosis ( 8 ) . Early echocardiography recommend patient present hospital emergency suspect heart failure ( HF ) acute onset symptom . Imaging technique play central role diagnosis HF guiding treatment . Among several image modality available , echocardiography method choice patient suspect HF reason accuracy , availability ( include portability ) , safety cost . The term echocardiography use refer cardiac ultrasound image technique , include two- three-dimensional echocardiography , pulse continuous wave Doppler , colour flow Doppler , tissue Doppler imaging . For assessment leave ventricular systolic diastolic dysfunction , single echocardiographic parameter sufficiently accurate reproducible use isolation . Therefore , comprehensive echocardiographic examination incorporate relevant two-dimensional Doppler data recommend . This include evaluation structural functional abnormality . However , type specialise echocardiography routinely available emergency room . In routine practice , systematic specialise echocardiography cardiologist case acute respiratory failure feasible due lack train operator . Indeed , train specialise echocardiography pre-requisite become qualified emergency room physician France . Lastly , specialise echocardiography exam time-consuming incompatible need manage vast flow patient busy emergency room . An alternative approach diagnosis measure blood concentration natriuretic peptide , family hormone secrete increased amount heart diseased load chamber increase ( 11 ) ( 12 ) ( 13 ) ( 14 ) ( 15 ) ( 16 ) . However , peptide suffer several limitation , particularly situation often encounter elderly patient , sepsis , renal failure , acute coronary syndrome , pulmonary embolism , chronic respiratory failure , atrial fibrillation high body mass index ( 17 ) . Diagnostic performance deteriorates increase age , significant increase grey-zone patient age ≥75 year ( 8 ) ( 16 ) ( 18 ) ( 19 ) . In critical situation elderly patient , assessment natriuretic peptide serve mainly rule diagnosis leave heart failure ( 8 ) ( 16 ) ( 19 ) . Some author suggest use lung ultrasound initial work-up acute respiratory failure ( 20 ) ( 21 ) ( 22 ) ( 23 ) ( 24 ) ( 25 ) ( 26 ) , since specific profile know related presence interstitial oedema , reflect impaired left heart function ( e.g . presence B line ) ( 27 ) ( 28 ) . These study perform context intensive critical care , data sparse regard application approach emergency room . In preliminary , single-centre study , utility quick transthoracic echography approach investigate , namely READ method ( Rapid Echography Acute Dyspnoea ) , associate target lung ultrasound measure transmitral flow 51 patient age ≥75 year . When perform patient 's admission emergency room , READ method show sensitivity 95 % identification ALSHF . Indeed , analysis transmitral flow easily available transthoracic echography . The presence `` restrictive '' pattern case acute dypsnoea associate existence ALSHF ( 29 ) ( 30 ) ( 31 ) ( 32 ) ( 33 ) . Echography diagnostic tool whose use emergency room increase exponentially . For example , `` Focused Assessment Sonography Trauma '' ( FAST ) ultrasound assessment technique trauma patient become cornerstone initial triage trauma patient . The idea use target ultrasound , necessarily perform specialist , achieve accurate triage patient minute guide subsequent diagnostic therapeutic approach . There paucity well-conducted study literature evaluate utility target chest ultrasound diagnostic work-up acute dyspnoea elderly patient admit emergency department . There currently exist consensus regard use echography patient , use largely depends competency availability operator emergency , absence formal evidence prove utility . Biomarkers brain natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) NT-proBNP lack sensitivity age-category patient , although widely use routine practice give impossibility rapid , 24/7 access specialise echocardiography . In context , study hypothesis diagnostic accuracy target quick echographic approach , namely READ method ( Rapid Echography Acute Dyspnoea ) , comprise target lung ultrasound combine isolated measure transmitral flow , would superior NT-proBNP assessment diagnosis ALSHF elderly patient ( ≥75 year ) admit emergency department .</detailed_description>
