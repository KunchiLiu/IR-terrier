	<detailed_description>Acute kidney injury frequently affect cancer patient , estimate annual risk 17.5 % cancer diagnosis . In critically ill cancer patient , acute kidney injury incidence vary 12 49 % , 9 32 % need renal replacement therapy . In last group patient , acute kidney injury frequently occur part multiple organic failure associate mortality rate 53 93 % , well increment cost day hospitalization . The main cause acute kidney injury ischemic damage cause transient decrease renal blood flow , follow blood flow restoration accompany reperfusion injury ( ischemia-reperfusion injury . The decrease renal blood flow follow increment aldosterone , hormone act epithelial cell mineralocorticoid receptor several tissue , include heart kidney . In kidney , aldosterone promotes sodium absorption potassium excretion . The decrease renal blood flow strong stimulus aldosterone secretion . This hormone non-genomic action smooth muscle cell vascular endothelium , cause vasoconstriction , interleukin oxygen reactive specie generation , beta-transforming growth factor ( TGF BETA ) mediate fibrosis , among others . At renal level , demonstrate mineralocorticoid receptor blockade prevent proteinuria glomerulosclerosis development animal model chronic kidney disease . Moreover , chronic kidney disease patient proteinuria , spironolactone addition angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor ( ACEI ) , reduce proteinuria 42 % without high risk hyperkalemia . Several study , mainly animal model try establish spironolactone role kidney injury induce ischemia-reperfusion injury . In acute chronic cyclosporine ( CyA ) nephrotoxicity rat model , spironolactone administration prevent kidney injury associate afferent arteriole vasoconstriction . In animal ischemia-reperfusion model produce renal artery clipping , spironolactone administration one ( Sp1 ) , two ( Sp2 ) three ( Sp3 ) day ischemic insult result well renal plasmatic flow creatinine clearance , prevent histopathological ischemic lesion . Spironolactone administration stimulate nitric oxide production prevent lipid peroxidation caspase 3 mediate apoptotic injury . To determine aldosterone blockade effect ischemic injury , new group animal receive spironolactone 0 , 3 , 6 9 hour IR insult . Spironolactone administration 6 hour IR insult prevent histologic kidney tubular damage . KIM-1 mRNA level augment 0 3 hour group , suggest spironolactone administration three hour renal ischemic injury prevent kidney damage . Considering IR injury principal etiologic agent acute kidney injury renal transplant patient , 2013 , pilot double blind clinical trial include 20 live kidney transplant divide spironolactone ( 25mg per day ) placebo group , receive drug one day three day renal transplant surgery . It observe spironolactone prophylactically treat patient , urinary level hydrogen peroxide inferior fifth day compare placebo group , however , difference serum creatinine level urinary biomarkers ( KIM-1 , IL-18 , HSP-72 ) . In trial , patient develop potassium level high 6mEq/dL one patient group serum potassium high 5mEq/L , demonstrate spironolactone administration safe . The group cancer patient state capable produce tissue hypoperfusion ( hypovolemic shock , heart failure , major surgery , use anesthetic ) increase risk develop acute renal ischemia-reperfusion injury . The investigator hypothesis spironolactone may useful prevent acute renal injury administer first six hour renal ischemia-reperfusion insult . The purpose study determine utility spironolactone administer ischemic renal insult ( major surgery ) prevent acute kidney injury critically cancer patient . Investigators propose pilot study , randomize , double blind , placebo control trial , approve local ethical committee , compare efficacy spironolactone prevent acute kidney injury patient major surgery . Investigators include 12 patient spironolactone group ( 25mg daily three day ) 12 patient placebo group . During five day investigator collect value plasma creatinine , sodium , potassium , blood ureic nitrogen , vital sign urinary output .</detailed_description>
