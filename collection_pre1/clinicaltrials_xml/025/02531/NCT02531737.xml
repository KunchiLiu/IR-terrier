	<brief_title>Nintedanib ( Vargatef® ) Plus Docetaxel Second Line Treatment Patients With Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>59 Patients histologically document stage IV NSCLC squamous , failure first line chemotherapy refractory ( progressive disease first line chemotherapy ) , enrol receive docetaxel :75 mg/m² IV day 1 every 3 week nintedanib ( vargatef® ) :200 mg X 2/day per o day2-day21 . Tumor response ( accord RECIST ) assess via compute tomography magnetic resonance imaging scan every 6 week ( evaluation PFS ) follow completion chemotherapy . Adverse event ( AEs ) grade accord National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria , version 4.0 Quality life ( EQ5-D ) assess every 6 week chemotherapy . Tolerability assess visit base Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) , v4.0 criterion . Total study duration per patient : approximately 12 month .</detailed_description>
