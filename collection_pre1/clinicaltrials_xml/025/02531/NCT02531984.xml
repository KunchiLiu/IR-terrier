	<brief_summary>Bronchiectasis characterize permanent abnormal dilatation part bronchial tree . An accumulation mucus respiratory tract ensues , result frequent bacterial infection eventual destruction lung . Clinically , patient present chronic productive cough episode acute respiratory exacerbation . Chronic respiratory failure follow . Although prevalence largely unknown , bronchiectasis consider rare orphan disease . There numerous cause disease : sequelae respiratory infection , immunodeficiency , genetic disease like cystic fibrosis , primary ciliary dyskinesia….The focus study non cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis child . Due lack pediatric clinical trial , management child disease widely base management adult patient cystic fibrosis pan-bronchiolitis . The treatment base respiratory physiotherapy , prevention infection , administration inhale corticosteroid anti biotherapy acute exacerbation . Recently , study demonstrate efficacy family antibiotic , macrolides , treatment cystic fibrosis pan-bronchiolitis child . Indeed , take 3 time week long period time , macrolides , specifically azithromycin show anti-inflammatory tissue repair property , addition antimicrobial property . Moreover , several study conduct adult population show use azithromycin lead significant reduction frequency respiratory exacerbation well improvement quality life . The efficacy azithromycin respiratory disease lead enlarge use long term treatment bronchiectasis . Yet , type treatment marketing authorization application . No study conduct child , individual examination patient bronchiectasis treat azithromycin suggests improvement symptom . Thus , use azithromycin treatment bronchiectasis child seem promising therapy . However , efficacy need demonstrate clinical trial lead pediatric population adequate number patient strong methodology order ensure validity reliability result . Therefore investigator decide conduct comparative , prospective multicenter randomize study population . This study intend include 100 patient already treat azithromycin least 6 month . After inclusion , randomize two group 50 patient . The first group continue treatment one discontinue . The patient follow inclusion period ( M0 ) onset first exacerbation maximum 6 month ( M6 ) , intermediate health care visit 3 month ( M3 ) . In case exacerbation , health care visit schedule ; patient receive appropriate treatment suspend study . The duration follow patient dictate occurrence first respiratory exacerbation , maximum 6 month .The total inclusion period 12 month total duration study 18 month .</brief_summary>
