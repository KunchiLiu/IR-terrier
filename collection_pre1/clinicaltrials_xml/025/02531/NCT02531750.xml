	<detailed_description>Introduction This study evaluate effect glucose , lipid bone metabolism follow conservative orthopaedic procedure patient suffer acute Achilles tendon rupture . The sedentary rehabilitation period follow procedure may impact negatively upon glucose , lipid bone metabolic pathways whereas physically active rehabilitation period institute 8 week injury hypothesize impose positive metabolic effect . An on-going clinical trial , Non-operative Treatment Acute Achilles Tendon Rupture : Early Controlled Mobilization Compared With Immobilization , ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier : NCT02015364 already address primary endpoint Achilles tendon total rupture score patient report validation score develop ass symptom physical activity treatment Achilles tendon rupture . The present study amendment/extension ongoing clinical trial . An oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) frequent measurement glucose , insulin , C-peptide plasma free fatty acid provide detailed information insulin sensitivity , glucose tolerance , beta cell function , lipolysis lipid oxidation well metabolic clearance insulin ( 11-13 ) . Modern DXA scanner exhibit high performance sensitivity distinguish small change BMD . Also sensitive marker change bone metabolism recently available . In particular two bone mass turnover marker ( BTM ) suggest monitor bone resorption ( CTX , carboxy-terminal cross-linked telopeptides type 1 collagen ) bone formation ( P1NP , procollagen type 1 amino-terminal propeptide ( 14 ) , also osteocalcin ( OC ) suggest marker bone formation . DXA scanner recently validate measure visceral adiposity , strongly associate insulin sensitivity ( 15 ) . A DXA scan expose individual X-ray radiation equal one day background radiation , make scan modality much less harmful term radiation dose compare traditional CT scan ( 100-fold less radiation ) . Traditional marker low grade inflammation ( LGI ) include TNFa IL6 hsCRP . New promise marker include suPAR plasma urine urine orosomucoid . suPAR show predict CVD non-diabetic community rest individual ( 16 ) . Urine orosomucoid strong predictor major event T2D might early marker glucose metabolic derangement ( 17 ) . Low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) particles especially low particle size atherogenic ( 18 ) . Thus increased level LGI marker immune marker include small LDL particle exhibit particular herogenic cocktail . A sedentary lifestyle associate increase marker LGI , impair immune response dyslipidaemia . In present set want investigate putative negative impact glucose , lipid , bone metabolism period restrain exercise secondary immobilization follow Achilles tendon rupture . We also want study patient physical active rehabilitation ( week 8 - 52 ) , establish whether succeed improve metabolic impairment suffer early post-injury period , period strong limitation physical activity prescribe ( week 0 - 8 ) . Perspective This study establish whether well-known effect glucose , lipid bone metabolism sedentary lifestyle observe already follow 8 week almost total abstain physical activity non-diabetic individual , suffer acute Achilles tendon rupture . Thereby , add knowledge previous finding follow strict bed-rest healthy individual glucose lipid metabolism bone turnover . In clinical perspective important examine extent individual deteriorate various metabolic pathway well understand pathophysiology behind defect healthy individual patient , undergo bed rest equal reduction physical activity part rehabilitation . Hypothesis Implementation sedentary lifestyle almost physical activity non-diabetic individual undergo non-operative treatment acute Achilles tendon rupture 8 week - impair insulin sensitivity glucose effectiveness - decrease disposition index - compensatory decrease insulin clearance - decrease lipid oxidation - increase visceral adipose tissue - increase number low density lipoprotein particles decrease particle size - increase immune low grade inflammatory response measure plasma urine - induce bone loss hip measure BMD - increase bone resorption decrease bone formation measure select bone turnover marker . During follow physical active rehabilitation week 8 week 52 propose negative impact upon glucose , lipid bone metabolism think reverse least partly . The relative positive effect metabolic performance hypothesize associate duration immobilization full mobilization , monitor use validated tool . Study design Fifty non-diabetic individual age 18 70 year undergo non-operative treatment acute Achilles tendon rupture include randomized clinical trial : Non-operative Treatment Acute Achilles Tendon Rupture : Early Controlled Mobilization Compared With Immobilization , ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier : NCT02015364 department orthopaedics , Hvidovre Hospital recruit case study . That study examine effect functional outcome measure early control mobilization ankle begin week 3 follow injury versus full immobilization initial 8 week post injury . Both group allow full weight-bearing begin week 3 physical activity level expect two group . As randomization regime unlikely influence metabolism . The present study include 50 case , examine early following injury ( &lt; 2 week ) ( baseline ) , 8 week ( 6 - 10 week ) injury 52 week ( 40 - 64 week ) injury , respectively . Examinations Oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) ingestion 75 g glucose maximum 3 min baseline ( 0 min ) . Plasma glucose , insulin , C-peptide , NEFA drawn time -10 , -5 , -1 , 10 , 15 , 20 , 30 , 45 , 60 , 75 , 90 , 105 , 120 , 150 , 180 , 240 min . This test perform morning start approximately 8 . The test do overnight fast least 10 hour . The individual bring morning spot urine measurement suPAR , creatinine , albumin orosomucoid . Before OGTT individual drawn blood measurement HbA1c , total cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , HDL cholesterol , triglyceride , Na , K , creatinine , HgB , CRP , leukocytes , ALAT , alkaline phosphatase , Ca++ , D vitamin , TSH , albumine amylase . Also blood BTM plasma suPAR , IL6 , TNFa hsCRP drawn . Finally blood lipid density profile lipid particle size drawn OGTT . Body weight height waist hip circumference measure . DXA hip lumbar columna include abdominal visceral subcutaneous fat do Hologic Discovery scanner use update software . DXA carry approximately 12 . Acquisition glucose lipid metabolism do use MinModel NEFA MinModel describe ( 11 ; 12 ) All blood urine sample destroy analysis . However research biobank establish since period time blood urine sample analysis exceeds 1 week . This study store urine blood sample freezer case subject control finish examination . The duration period maximum 2 year last patient last visit . Thus research biobank establish storage . The urine blood sample destroy analysis Hvidovre Glostrup Hospitals . Analysis result anonymous send abroad researcher Prof. Raymond Boston USA , perform statistical calculation analysis data . Permission establishment research biobank obtain Danish Data protection Agency . Measurements physical activity acquire Primary Investigators ongoing trial `` Non-operative Treatment Acute Achilles Tendon Rupture : Early Controlled Mobilization Compared With Immobilization '' . Statistics Ten day bed rest 13 healthy young individual show 20 % ( P &lt; 0.05 ) significant decrease insulin sensitivity 50 % ( P &lt; 0.05 ) reduction lipid oxidation ( 2 ) . Thirty-one day bed rest 8 healthy woman significantly associate bone loss total hip ( 2.07 % , P &lt; 0.001 ) ( 7 ) . The present study imply strict bed rest exhibit long sedentary period follow compare study include large number participant , also . During initial 8 week strictly sedentary immobilization follow injury Achilles tendon suggest patient decrease insulin sensitivity least 20 % , estimate SD endpoint 20 % . Thus , use MIREDIF statistic ( Douglas Altman , Practical statistics Medical research , Chapman &amp; Hall , 1999 ) , calculate population 22 patient generate power &gt; 90 % significance level P &lt; 0.05 investigate primary endpoint . Similarly , SD lipidoxidation 30 % estimate change sedentary period least 30 % , thus n=22 patient power &gt; 90 % . Finally change BMD likely 1 % SD 1 % , thus n=22 patient provide statistical power least 90 % . During period physical restitution estimate fully reversion deficit endpoint sedentary period , i.e . similar calculation power valid restitution period . The participant present study include randomized clinical trial : Non-operative Treatment Acute Achilles Tendon Rupture : Early Controlled Mobilization Compared Immobilization . Randomization regime unlikely influence metabolism , however , consider variable statistical analysis endpoint . Ethical issue The study adhere Danish Act Processing Personal Data , Danish Act Health Helsinki II convention clinical trial . All participant inform purpose study ethical issue write consent obtain participation . At give time , participant withdraw acceptant participation study .
