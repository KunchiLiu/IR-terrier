	<brief_summary>Osteogenesis imperfecta ( OI ) rare inherit disorder cause bone break easily . Individuals osteogenesis imperfecta break bone often may problem , include hearing loss , dental problem , pain difficulty get around . Before genetic cause OI know , OI classify four type . Each type base upon symptom severity OI . In people OI , cause change one gene make protein call type 1 collagen . Some doctor classify OI severe well gene cause OI . When people classify OI way , 10 type OI . The current laboratory test determine OI subtype involve collection blood and/or skin cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Osteogenesis Imperfecta ( OI ) rare disorder cause bone break easily . People OI may break bone little trauma , dentinogenesis imperfecta ( DI ) , , adult year , hear loss . It see gender race . OI range severe mild . Individuals severe type OI may die birth . People severe OI survive may bow arm leg , short stature unable walk . People mild form OI may break bone occasionally normal height lifespan . Breaks occur bone , common arm legs . People OI also often problem spine . The spine problem include compression fracture scoliosis ( curvature spine ) . DI characterize grey brown teeth may chip wear break easily . In addition weak teeth , teeth upper jaw may match teeth low jaw . Before genetic cause OI know , OI classify four type . Each type base upon symptom severity OI . In people OI , cause change one gene make protein call type 1 collagen . In past decade , discover 5 % people OI another gene . Some doctor classify OI severe well gene cause OI . When people classify OI way , 10 type OI . The current laboratory test determine OI subtype involve collection blood and/or skin cell .</detailed_description>
