	<brief_summary>Using European data patient include Named Patient Program ( NPP ) early post-marketing authorization period , present study aim describe patient characteristic describe effectiveness Daclatasvir ( DCV ) -based regimen Europe . This retrospective cohort study patient receive treatment DCV-based regimen follow context : - Patients enrol within European NPP one follow country Austria , Denmark , Italy , Sweden , Spain , Switzerland , United Kingdom ; - In country DCV commercially available ( ie , Sweden , Germany , United Kingdom ) , patient receive DCV early post-marketing authorization period The result study contribute good understand effectiveness DCV-based regimen population differs population clinical trial , therefore provide additional valuable information inform clinical practice . This study intend estimate primarily effectiveness DCV-based regimen measure sustain virologic response post treatment follow-up visit week 12 ( SVR12 ) . As well estimate effectiveness DCV-based regimen measure SVR12 end Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) . This study intend also describe secondary objective characteristic ( ie , demographic clinical characteristic treatment pattern patient start new DCV-based regimen ) patient receive DCV well effectiveness DCV-based regimen measure : - On-treatment virological response post treatment follow-up visit Week 4 ; - Virological response end treatment ( EOT ) ; - The sustained viral response post treatment follow-up visit Week 4 ( SVR4 ) post treatment follow-up visit Week 24 ( SVR24 ) ; - The occurrence virological failure ( on-treatment relapse ) . An exploratory objective ass concordance SVR4 SVR12 among overall population treat DCV .</brief_summary>
