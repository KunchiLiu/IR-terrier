	<brief_summary>This study focus different injection needle perceive patient . The needle differ design mechanical property , test people Type 2 Diabetes . The measured parameter needle insertion : penetration force skin ( measure force gauge ) , pain perception ( rat visual analog scale , VAS , scale 0 10 ) , skin blood perfusion insertion site ( measure laser speckle contrast scanner ) . Furthermore , skin reaction record .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It estimate presently 370 million diabetic world , number increase , particularly newly industrialize country , China India . Approximately 90 % diabetic Type 2 diabetes , often cause lifestyle , obesity lack exercise . 3-5 % diabetic Type 1 diabetes , cause disease unknown . The remain 5-7 % either pregnancy diabetes ( temporary illness ) , MODY ( `` Maturity-Onset Diabetes Young '' ) rarer form diabetes . For treatment Type 1 diabetes , insulin inject subcutaneous tissue take circulation . People Type 1 Diabetes produce insulin must thus inject insulin stabilize blood sugar level , typically via one two daily injection basal insulin , well so-called `` bolus '' injection time meal . This add approximately 4-5 daily insulin injection . Type 2 diabetic , still `` early '' disease , reduce sensitivity insulin produce , pancreas overproduces insulin . Beyond lifestyle change , treatment metformin tablet form case first-line drug . In late stage disease , insulin production decrease insulin therapy initiate , optionally combination GLP-1 analogue ( Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 ) . It estimate half people Type 2 diabetes diagnose , half diagnose treatment . Worldwide , 27 % treat type 2 diabetic patient receive insulin treatment , GLP-1 analog , 1-2 time day . From figure estimate 100 million diabetes injection perform globally every day . In addition , disorder also require subcutaneous administration drug , e.g . growth hormone therapy inflammatory disease rheumatoid arthritis intestinal disease . Thus , great importance needle use injection , painless comfortable use possible . The large needle manufacturer many year seek make needle less painful cause less skin trauma . Until recently , measure primarily make needle thinner short , needle alternative grinding needle tip design market . This compensate decrease robustness new thin needle , increase risk patient damage needle tip injection . Little known , however , design change influence perception pain , skin damage , etc . Despite large market subcutaneous needle , method test newly develop needle remain many year . One method frequently use mechanical test needle pass rubber strip , penetration force measure . This method rapid , reproducible little variation , publish data compare force measure rubber strip , measure human , penetration force rubber strip relate pain , discomfort , physiological parameter . Smith compare insertion force measure rubber strip piece cut porcine tissue conclusion two behave differently rubber strip estimate primarily useful test needle lubrication friction-reducing parameter . The second method often use subjective patient assessment , test subject use 'Visual Analogue Scale ' ( VAS ) indicate much pain experience connection needle insertion . Pain indicate VAS know accept method , simultaneously measurement method great variety , person 's pain sensitivity depend many thing stress level , emotional state , well expectation experience . This project innovative introduces new method quantitatively measure small tissue damage skin , example , needle insertion . The study combine technological medical research form mechanical design medical device biological evaluation mechanical impact , opinion highly relevant quite innovative . Results study used develop new improve needle , predict increase patient satisfaction make everyday life injection easier convenient many million people diabetes every day take insulin / GLP-1 injection . The method base Laser Speckle technology , measure tissue damage term increase skin blood perfusion connection needle insertion . Prior project , project group perform number test pig method proven sensitive enough detect difference blood perfusion occur result difference tissue damage cause insertion needle vary less 0.1 mm diameter , Williams et al use photoelectric pletysmografi ( PPG ) investigate change skin blood perfusion human subject follow injection insulin dilute insulin , well needle insertion investigate effect needle trauma alone . A rapid increase blood flow see intervention . Insulin injection result increased signal 60 minute injection , whereas dilute liquid needle insertion create increase signal 10 minute . By use laser Doppler technology , Rayman et al study skin circulation change needle insertion people without diabetes . The study reveal people diabetes low maximum-perfusion needle insertion healthy subject . Both mention clinical study indicate method obtain project group 's pig study could transfer human study . Thus , study include 35 test subject receive needle insertion 18 differently design needle . Penetration force skin , pain perception skin blood perfusion record needle , skin reaction record . By end study , follow question answer : 1 . Which needle design parameter influence pain skin blood perfusion , two effect relate ? 2 . Does skin blood perfusion needle insertion human compare measure pig ? 3 . Does penetration force relate pain skin blood perfusion , needle design parameter influence force skin , relate penetration force rubber strip ?</detailed_description>
