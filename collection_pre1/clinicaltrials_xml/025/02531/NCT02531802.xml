	<brief_title>Enterotoxigenic Escherichia Coli ( ETEC ) ETVAX Vaccine Trial Bangladesh</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase I/II trial serve ass whether ETVAX safe provide mucosal well systemic immune response key protective antigen test different age-groups Bangladesh . This study provide opportunity test safety profile mucosal adjuvant , double-mutant LT ( dmLT ) , adults child , well provide opportunity potentially assess ability dmLT enhance mucosal systemic antibody response key antigen ETVAX vaccine among age group develop country site , like Bangladesh , prove refractory oral immunization enteric vaccine . In addition , study also allow evaluation potential dose-sparing effect dmLT combine low dose vaccine . Finally , clinical trial consider essential study along critical path overall clinical development plan determine whether vaccine test protective efficacy child develop country .</detailed_description>
