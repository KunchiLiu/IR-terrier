	<brief_title>Study Comparing Polyurethane Films Sugarcane Biopolymer Used Dressings</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Randomized control clinical trial . The target study population comprise patient Unified Health System ( SUS ) , Outpatient Surgery Pediatric Urology , Clinical Hospital Federal University Pernambuco ( UFPE ) , include child ( 01 year ) , adolescent adult regardless age , lesion arise treatment hypospadias , well surgical injury , accord ethical principle outline Resolution 466 2012 National Health Council . Polyurethane film - Tegaderm ® -The polyurethane film size , 4.4 6.0 X 4.4 X 7.0 log National Agency Sanitary Surveillance ( ANVISA ) / Health Ministry ( MS ) 10,002,070,019 manufacture Minnesota Mining Manufacturing Company ( 3M ) , follow feature : versatile waterproof barrier external contaminant , wrap body contour promote patient comfort . Biopolymer film sugarcane ( POLYSHAFT ® ) -The biopolymer film sugarcane provide research group biopolymer Sugarcane Experimental Station research laboratory ( UFRPE ) . The biopolymer film similar dimension polyurethane film , cut adapted dimension body patient . All patient subject interview ask previous surgery . The researcher conduct physical urological examination determine degree hypospadias / assessment procedure necessary observation need ( display ) dress polyurethane film biopolymer sugar cane ( POLYSHAFT® ) . Patients randomly allocate group : Biopolymer film molasses sugar polyurethane , use seal , opaque , number envelope contain computer-generated random distribution 1:1 ratio block 10 's envelope open operate room nurse start procedure . All volunteer patient admit pediatric surgery ward Clinical Hospital/UFPE surgical procedure carry researcher . All patient receive intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis begin surgery routine hospital clinic . Patient recruitment data analysis arise research take place August 2014 August 2015 , publication result expect October 2015 . The follow-up evaluation patient perform daily removal bandage eighth postoperative day . Variables together : - Rate Biocompatibility : Assessment adverse reaction irritation skin . The researcher observation issue concept : : No skin irritability , limited foreskin irritability extend area irritability . - Degree adherence : Assessed researcher observation deliver concept grip area detachment , grip without detachment adhesion . - Degree annoyance : Patients caregiver respond questionnaire concept `` upset , '' `` little disturbed '' `` bother '' dress . - Grade adhesion permanence `` situ '' subject action water cleaning three time day . All observation patient guardian must communicate researcher .</detailed_description>
