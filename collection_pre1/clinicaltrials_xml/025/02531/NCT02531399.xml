	<brief_summary>Neurovascular couple functional hyperemia define essential physiologic mechanism brain , necessary local adaption blood flow alter metabolic demand tissue . It show also eye , blood flow considerably couple retinal neural activity . The current concept functional hyperemia visual stimulation , flicker light , effectuate increase neural activity retina , elevate metabolic need retinal tissue oxygen glucose consequently induces dilatation augment blood flow retinal vasculature . In several study , stimulation flicker light show induce increase blood flow major retinal artery vein well increase optic nerve head blood flow . Up , flicker induce change blood flow measure solely major retinal artery vein system commercially available dynamic vessel analyzer ( DVA ) Imedos laser Doppler velocimetry ( LDV ) . In present study , investigator propose measure response total retinal blood flow diffuse luminance flicker stimulation bi-directional Fourier Domain Doppler Optical Coherence Tomography ( FDOCT ) well Laser Speckle Flowgraphy ( LSFG ) healthy subject assess vessel diameter , blood velocity blood flow retinal vessel . For comparative reason , investigator furthermore assess blood flow major retinal artery vein dynamic vessel analyzer ( DVA ) laser Doppler velocimetry ( LDV ) .</brief_summary>
