	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease lead cause mortality United States . Among patient survive acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) , cardiac rehabilitation ( CR ) demonstrate effectively reduce risk re-infarction , cardiac mortality , all-cause mortality . However , despite cardiac rehabilitation Class I ( standard care ) recommendation multiple American Heart Association acute myocardial infarction guideline , 80 % eligible patient receive appropriate cardiac rehabilitation much due challenge access program . Recent innovation technology allow u passively monitor individual 's physical activity use wearable device . Incentives design use insight behavioral economics demonstrate motivate device engagement behavior change . A remotely-monitored cardiac rehabilitation program could improve access many individual potentially cost-effective less resource- personnel-intensive . The objective study use randomize , control trial test effectiveness home-based physical activity program use wearable device financial incentive .</detailed_description>
