	<detailed_description>Physical inactivity associate cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) risk factor , include obesity , diabetes , dyslipidemia , hypertension , increase risk CVD death . In Framingham Heart Study ( FHS ) Third Generation ( Gen 3 ) multiethnic Omni 2 cohort participant , objectively measure accelerometry physical activity ( PA ) data show moderate vigorous PA associate healthy CVD risk factor profiles.6 Despite health benefit engage PA , half FHS participant achieve U.S. recommend aerobic PA guideline , consistent low rate observe adult nationally . Experts estimate increase PA 10 % would annually save Â½ million life worldwide . There lot interest use `` social '' team-based design increase PA . Prior evaluation FHS find rate smoke obesity associate social connectedness within social network . Evidence industry find intervention use social comparison feedback change electricity use effective , paired appropriate social approval disapproval . PA intervention could leverage social incentive design intervention increase peer support , accountability , unity towards common goal . In five pilot study conduct 2014 University Pennsylvania , investigator find different incentive feedback design result differential effectiveness . These preliminary data support notion careful test alternative social incentive combination important conduct decide intervention scale broadly . The rapidly expand availability mobile technology provide resource effective way implement social incentive intervention improve health . Many type health device ( e.g . glucometers , pedometer ) provide individual feedback performance ( e.g . blood sugar step count ) . With wireless device technologically feasible provide relative feedback periodic interval . However , utilize mobile health ( mHealth ) device rarely do could represent significant opportunity improve health behavior low cost . For study , investigator leverage University Pennsylvania 's NIH-funded Way Health infrastructure . The platform incorporate automate input wireless device capture behavior deliver automate feedback participant . While conduct 5 pilot study note , investigator find smartphones wearable device accurate track physical activity data . The investigator conduct pilot study leverage information acquire Digital Connectedness Survey test deployment social incentive intervention use FHS Offspring , Generation 3 , Omni cohorts increase PA . The investigator leverage strength FHS recruiting trio nuclear family test whether social connectedness increase PA . The investigator utilize randomize controlled trial design . The investigator test social incentive intervention strategy use team-based design participant work together jointly achieve PA goal , social connectedness intervention . The primary outcome intervention pilot study proportion individual participant-days goal achieve 12-week intervention period . Individuals find PA maintenance challenge PA sustainability study systematically . As secondary aim intervention study , investigator examine PA goal achievement durability 12 week intervention end . Specific Aims : Aim 1 . To test feasibility use team-based social incentive intervention increase PA FHS participant . H1 : The demographic clinical characteristic individual agrees randomize young healthy agree participate . H2 : FHS participant elect Fitbit place Moves app differ base demographic clinical characteristic . Aim 2 . To evaluate effectiveness team-based social incentive intervention achieve PA goal among connected individual team compare control group individual . H4 : A team-based social incentive intervention comprise connected individual team effective achieve PA goal control group individual . Secondary Aim . To evaluate whether difference achieve PA goal study arm 12-week intervention sustain 12-week follow-up period . H6 : PA level 12-week follow-up decline arm remain different similar fashion intervention period . This study potential address major public health problem sedentary lifestyle , consequent increase risk obesity CVD risk factor progression . The investigator bring together multi-disciplinary team expertise PA , CVD epidemiology , biostatistics , behavioral economics . The investigator propose innovative link classical randomized clinical trial ( RCT ) design many strengths epidemiological FHS . This pilot RCT examine effectiveness different approach leverage social incentive improve health behavior , area considerable promise increase effectiveness variety health intervention . Ultimately goal leverage pilot study implement large study FHS . The investigator also anticipate ultimately linking result extant FHS genetics database .</detailed_description>
