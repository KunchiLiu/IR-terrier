	<brief_summary>Current post-operative monitoring patient recovery consist measure two blood marker C-reactive protein ( CRP ) White Blood Cell Count ( WBC ) . However , slow respond onset infection . However , monitor absolute level proteins three pathway complement cascade provide fast good predictor patient recovery . The investigator propose pilot trial measure concentration Complement Cascade ( CC ) activation biomarkers blood time course around operation major abdomino-pelvic surgery involve bowel resection . Further , analysis differential CC pathway activation identify onset recovery complication clinical symptom present potentially identify cause allow clinician target therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The propose study pilot study cohort participant recruit routine elective colorectal surgery RD &amp; E . The pilot trial collect blood time course patient record blood plasma level Complement proteins peri-operatively admission discharge . The assay schedule detail Table 1 . The trial perform additional CC activation test routine blood sample take patient 's stay hospital . In addition 4 trial sample take time interval capture impulse response patient 's CC . Sample analysis perform parallel clinical chemistry laboratory laboratory assay CRP complement protein C3 C4 . The additional trial assay perform MSD platform loan period trial .

The TCC assay design Cardiff ( Prof Morgan collaborator Prof Shaw ) investigator extensive experience design C protein assay . For target biomarkers antibodies neo-antigens reveal post enzymatic cleavage complex formation use capture antibody surface MSD platform . The C protein detect polyclonal antibody provide Prof Morgan Cardiff label ruthenium tag antibody . Whole EDTA-stabilised plasma incubate 96-well format ; 5 assay , include calibration curve , run simultaneously . Electroluminescence ruthenium complex collect quantify automatically . Absolute measurement C protein perform use standardise fully activate serum contain constant amount activation product complement pathway . The serum available Prof Morgan 's collaboration 'Complement Standardization Group ' . C activation relative standard determine . This work lead array C activation marker test patient cohort . This array include pathway marker may ultimately become basis routine clinical test .</detailed_description>
