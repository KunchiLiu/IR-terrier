	<criteria>Women metastatic breast cancer ( measurable evaluable include bone metastasis ) Histologically confirm triple negative breast cancer ( ER &lt; 10 % , PR &lt; 10 % , Her2neu IHC 0 1 FISH/ISH negative ) Age ≥ 18 year WHO performance status ≤ 2 Adequate bone marrow function show : ANC ≥ 1.5 x 10^9/L , Platelets ≥ 75 x 10^9/L , Hb &gt; 9 g/dL Adequate liver function show : serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN ALT AST ≤ 2.5x ULN ( ≤ 5x ULN patient liver metastasis ) Adequate renal function : serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN Signed informed consent Patients may 3 prior regimen metastatic disease A baseline CT chest/abdomen/pelvis bone scan PET/CT Negative serum pregnancy test within 7 day prior start treatment Stable brain metastasis allow ( &gt; 2 week , clinicallystable post treatment surgery+/radiation radiation alone steroid ) Prior carboplatin allow provide great 12 mo elapse since last dose carboplatin Patients currently receive anticancer therapy receive anticancer therapy within 2 week start study drug ( include chemotherapy , radiation therapy , biologics ) Patients , major surgery significant traumatic injury within 4 week start study drug , patient recover side effect major surgery ( define require general anesthesia ) patient may require major surgery course study Prior treatment investigational drug within precede 2 week Patients receive chronic , systemic treatment corticosteroid another immunosuppressive agent , except corticosteroid daily dosage equivalent prednisone ≤ 20 mg . However , patient receive corticosteroid must stable dosage regimen minimum 4 week prior first treatment Everolimus . Topical inhale corticosteroid allow . Coadministration strong inhibitor CYP3A4 ( e.g. , ketoconazole , itraconazole , ritonavir ) Pglycoprotein ( PgP ) prohibit . Coadministration moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor ( e.g. , erythromycin , fluconazole ) PgP inhibitor may use caution everolimus dose must discuss PI time enrollment . For current table Substrates , Inhibitors Inducers please access follow website : http : //www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/ '' Patients receive live attenuate vaccine within 1 week start Everolimus study . Patient also avoid close contact others receive live attenuate vaccine . Examples live attenuate vaccine include intranasal influenza , measles , mumps , rubella , oral polio , BCG , yellow fever , varicella TY21a typhoid vaccine Uncontrolled brain metastasis Leptomeningeal metastases Other malignancy within past 3 year except adequately treat carcinoma cervix basal squamous cell carcinoma skin . Patients severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition condition could affect participation study : Symptomatic congestive heart failure New York heart Association Class III IV unstable angina pectoris , symptomatic congestive heart failure , myocardial infarction within 6 month start study drug , serious uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia clinically significant cardiac disease severely impaired lung function define spirometry DLCO 50 % normal predict value and/or 02 saturation 89 % less rest room air uncontrolled diabetes define fast serum glucose &gt; 1.5 x ULN active ( acute chronic ) uncontrolled severe infection liver disease cirrhosis , chronic active hepatitis chronic persistent hepatitis Note : A detailed assessment Hepatitis B/C medical history risk factor must do screening patient . HBV DNA HCV RNA PCR test require screening patient positive medical history base risk factor and/or confirmation prior HBV/HCV infection . See Appendix I ( Hep Screening Form ) A known history HIV seropositivity Impairment gastrointestinal function gastrointestinal disease may significantly alter absorption Everolimus ( e.g. , ulcerative disease , uncontrolled nausea , vomit , diarrhea , malabsorption syndrome small bowel resection ) Patients active , bleeding diathesis Patients receive prior treatment mTOR inhibitor ( sirolimus , temsirolimus , everolimus ) . Patients know hypersensitivity Everolimus rapamycins ( sirolimus , temsirolimus ) excipients Patients know hypersensitivity carboplatin History noncompliance medical regimen Patients unwilling unable comply protocol Ongoing alcohol drug addiction Female patient pregnant breast feeding , adult reproductive potential use effective birth control method . If barrier contraceptive use , must continue throughout trial sex . Hormonal contraceptives acceptable sole method contraception . ( Women childbearing potential must negative urine serum pregnancy test within 7 day prior administration Everolimus )</criteria>
