	<brief_summary>Many infectious pathogen , like ETEC , initiate infection first interact gut mucosal surface human host . Consequently , vaccination strategy well stimulate protective mucosal immunity need effectively control large number intestinal pathogen cause morbidity mortality human . The LT toxin ETEC unique antigen also inherent mucosal adjuvant property co-administered antigen . Thus , protein potential stand-alone vaccine well mucosal adjuvant co-administered vaccine antigen . The primary objective ass safety tolerability dmLT vaccine administer three dos intradermally range dosage healthy adult subject .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 1 Study dmLT ID Vaccination Healthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , double-blinded , single site outpatient Phase 1 study healthy adult determine safety immunogenicity ETEC candidate vaccine , attenuate recombinant dmLT ETEC , administer ID route . The sample size determine base historic sample , power calculation . The study involve 99 subject ( 83 vaccinee 16 placebo control ) 4 consecutive cohort 16 individual ( 13 vaccinee 3 placebo control ) final cohort 35 ( 31 vaccinee 4 placebo ) subject . A total 16 subject ( retain 10 vaccinee 1 placebo evaluable subject ) cohorts 1-4 initially recruit , 13 subject receive three separate dos dmLT intradermally 1 , 22 43-day , 3 subject cohort receive three dos placebo ( saline ) blind fashion . As outpatient study , subject receive vaccination remain clinic observation minimum 30 minute . Safety data review Safety Monitoring Team Committee . Subjects may replace ensure 10 evaluable subject single cohort , define receive 3 vaccine dos . If replacement subject include need randomize per cohort single group include 1 subject receive placebo maintain blind ensure one placebo cohort . Final confirmatory cohort include 35 vaccinee randomly select receive either 1 , 2 3 vaccine dos placebo . The study duration approximately 1.5-2 year , include 6 month follow-up approximately 9 month subject duration . The Primary Objective ass safety tolerability dmLT vaccine administer three intradermal dos range dosage level healthy adult subject . The Secondary objective assess long-term safety follow-up immunization Month 6 month post last vaccination , follow three ID dose dmLT vaccine range dosage level evaluate dmLT-specific immune response assay .</detailed_description>
