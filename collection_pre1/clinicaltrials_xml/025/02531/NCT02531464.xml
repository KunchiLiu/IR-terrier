	<brief_summary>Family caregiver play crucial role cancer patient care , principal source support . It well recommend provide resource , information support need maintain good health , sustain caregiving role . Recently , oncology centre implement systematic distress screen program , focus limited cancer patient , little intervention family caregiver . This study aim address gap . It implement test effectiveness simple intervention integrate primary care oncology care transfer practice main recommendation governmental authority expert globally improve supportive care . The intervention include systematic distress screen problem assessment family caregiver diagnosis , every two month , privilege contact nurse away patient address caregiver distress identify problem , caregiver experience high level distress , liaison study nurse family physician transfer information identify problem level distress facilitate share follow-up . This intervention pilot-tested family caregiver , health care provider decision maker involve lung cancer care , well community-based family physician , ensure feasibility acceptability . This study finding may clearly improve patient caregiver experience cancer care , reduce burden disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intervention Improve Supportive Care Family Caregivers Patients With Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lung cancer may cause severe distress patient also family caregiver ( FCs ) , direct impact quality life ( QoL ) . Distress high FCs patient . Results recent study continuity cancer care conduct investigator support finding , significantly large proportion FCs patient report high level anxiety distress early diagnosis lung cancer difference remain 6 12 month . Several cancer center implement systematic distress screen program care trajectory , target patient without extend FCs . This study aim implement assess effectiveness multi-faceted intervention improve supportive care FCs patient lung cancer . Specific objective : 1 . To assess effectiveness intervention : 1.1 Caregivers ' outcome : distress ( primary outcome ) , anxiety , depression , QoL , need , burden , perception health , preparedness caregiving , perceive social support 1.2 Patients ' outcome : distress , anxiety , depression , QoL , pain symptom relief 1.3 Care process outcome : FCs patient ' utilization service 2 . To document describe : 2.1 In experimental group : FCs perceive usefulness intervention perceive effect distress/QoL 2.2 In oncology team : perceived usefulness intervention perceive effect practice/organization care Methods : An experimental design use test intervention 9 month pulmonary oncology clinic Quebec City distress screen tool implement cancer patient ( FCs ) . A total 120 FCs patient newly diagnose non-surgical lung cancer , follow clinic randomly assign either intervention ( experimental group N=60 ) usual care ( control group N=60 ) . Considering 20 % withdrawal rate ( due death severe deterioration patient ' condition ) , sample size allows detect 33 % difference distress score two group , estimate baseline distress score ( HADS ) 13.7±7 ( range 0-42 ) , 5 % alpha error power 80 % . The intervention comprise 3 component : 1 ) systematic distress screen problem assessment FCs relative 's cancer diagnosis , every 2 month maximum 9 month ; 2 ) privilege contact oncology nurse away patient identify address FCs ' problem ; 3 ) liaison oncology nurse family physician FCs report high level distress ( score ≥ 4 distress thermometer , indicate need intervention ) , mention need help . In group , outcomes related FCs care process measure validated tool baseline every 3 month , maximum 9 month . Measures take interval patient since physical mental health may influence FCs ' distress . Individual interview 12 FCs plan assess usefulness intervention effect QoL . Interviews pivot nurse oncology document satisfaction regard intervention effect practice . Relevance . This translational study aim assess effectiveness intervention transfer practice main recommendation governmental authority expert regard integrate care globally improve cancer supportive care . It potential make significant impact burden disease FCs improve quality care . If proven effective , condition success intervention could replicate setting type cancer .</detailed_description>
