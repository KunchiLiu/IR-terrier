	<detailed_description>Objective : This purpose protocol development two potential nonpharmacologic treatment youth chronic , severe impair irritability . The first potential treatment Interpretation Bias Training ( IBT ) , computer-based training design shift emotional judgment ambiguous face away angry , toward happy , judgment . The first component protocol include randomize , trial active IBT youth severe irritability . The second potential treatment cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) target severe irritability ; goal protocol develop pilot use CBT design treat severe irritability . Specifically , CBT , protocol include work design develop treatment procedure ; train clinician method ; collect pilot data could provide justification randomize control trial CBT irritability . Objective 1a : Assess efficacy Interpretation Bias Training ( IBT ) youth severe irritability , operationalized meeting criterion DSM-5 Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder ( DMDD ) . To accomplish objective , conduct randomize , control trial ( RCT ) active Interpretation Bias Training 40 youth DMDD . Subjects randomize receive four IBT training session ( active vs. placebo , double-blind design ) four day follow weekly mood rating two week . Primary outcome measure trial ass change irritability use Affective Reactivity Index ( ARI : clinician-rated , parent-rated , child-rated ) Clinical Global Impressions-improvement ( CGI-I ) . After complete RCT , participant continue show irritability measure Clinical Global Impressions-Severity ( CGI-S ) rating 3 great , receive four open , active IBT session , deliver schedule RCT use primary outcome measure . Objective 1b : Pilot efficacy weekly booster additional IBT session ( IBT extension ) , beyond Objective 1a , extend augment impact IBT irritability youth DMDD . To accomplish objective , extend IBT three time week , eight week individual continue show symptom irritability . Specifically , anyone , complete Open Active IBT , continue show clinical impairment due irritability , measure Clinical Global Impressions-Severity ( CGI-S ) rating 3 great , eligible continue Active IBT training . Primary outcome measure IBT extension ass change irritability use ARI ( clinicianrated , parent-rated , child-rated ) CGI-I . Objective 2 : Develop pilot use manualized CBT severe irritability youth DMDD .

Secondary Objective 2 : Assess effect CBT irritability clinical measure depression , anxiety , functional impairment . Subjects participate one potential treatment . If opt , IBT occur first four-week wash-out period start pilot work CBT . Study population : The study take place National Institutes Health ( NIH ) . All outpatient , age 8-17 , enrol NIMH-DIRP Protocol 02-M-0021 , stable treatment community invite participate study . Design : The first part protocol involve conduct randomize controlled trial IBT 40 youth meet criterion DMDD . The goal novel , potential treatment decrease severity child irritability . Subjects also offer eight week Extension Open Active IBT session . The second part protocol involve develop CBT target severe irritability . After develop CBT treatment train staff conduct , pilot 60 child . If pilot study promise result , apply IRB permission conduct randomize trial psychotherapy . Subjects elect participate IBT randomize control trial extension session , CBT treatment development piloting , . If subject elect participate , complete IBT arm first , follow CBT arm , one-month wash-out period . Outcome measure : The main outcome measure assess change irritability use ARI ( clinician-rated , parent-rated , child-rated ) CGI-I . Secondary measure include parent self-report measure depression , anxiety , anger , social status , aggression , well clinician rating depression , anxiety , impairment .
