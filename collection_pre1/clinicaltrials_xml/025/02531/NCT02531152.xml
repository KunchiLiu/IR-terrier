	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : To assess local systemic safety tolerability ascend repeat topical dos SAR366234 monotherapy patient open angle glaucoma ( OAG ) ocular hypertension ( OHT ) compare latanoprost . Secondary Objective : To assess pharmacodynamic activity ascend repeat topical dos SAR366234 patient OAG OHT compare latanoprost .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>28-Day Repeated Topical Study Evaluate Safety Activity 5 Escalating Dose Levels SAR366234 One Dose Latanoprost Patients With Open Angle Glaucoma Ocular Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The total study duration one patient 11 week , include screen period 6 week run-in ( depend washout requirement ) , 4-week treatment period , 1-week follow-up period . The study design also parallel cohort study ass safety , tolerability , pharmacodynamic activity SAR366234 .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion : Male female patient ≥18 year age . Patients diagnose OAG ( include pseudoexfoliation pigment dispersion syndromes patient history narrow angle closure patent peripheral iridotomy ) OHT . Documented intraocular pressure ( IOP ) fulfil eligibility criterion ( ) screen baseline visit : At screen visit IOP ≤21 mmHg eye currently treat IOPlowering medication IOP ≥22 mmHg &lt; 36 mmHg treatmentnaïve IOP lower medication least 5 week . At baseline visit follow washout IOP ≥22 mmHg &lt; 36 mmHg 8:00 , IOP &gt; 20 mmHg &lt; 36 mmHg 12:00 noon , IOP &gt; 18 mmHg &lt; 36 mmHg 4:00 pm . Baseline laboratory parameter within define screen threshold Investigator site , unless Investigator consider document abnormality clinically irrelevant . Having give write informed consent prior undertake studyrelated procedure , include stop current glaucoma treatment , , engage correspond washout procedure . Patients agree discontinue concomitant topical ocular medication ( ) current IOPreducing agent . Best correct Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( ETDRS ) visual acuity score +1.0 logMAR ( Snellen equivalent 20/200 ) good eye screen baseline visit . Patients systemic β blocker must stable dose least 2 week screen expect continue treatment study anticipate alteration medication dose . Patients agree discontinue contact lenses treatment study medication . Exclusion criterion : Any clinically significant disease concomitant medication would interfere study evaluation . Patients advance glaucoma risk progression study opinion Investigator . Presence history hypersensitivity latanoprost know history nonresponse prostaglandin analog give reduction IOP . History hypersensitivity allergy component investigational medicinal product diagnostic medication material use conduct study . Use expect need ocular ( topical , periocular , intravitreal ) , local ( inhaled nasal ) , systemic glucocorticoid medication within 4 week prior baseline visit duration study . Any vaccination within last 28 day randomization screen whichever longer . Any patient exclusion period previous study accord applicable regulation . Any patient contact case emergency . Any patient Investigator subinvestigator , research assistant , pharmacist , study coordinator , staff thereof , directly involve conducting study . Positive result follow test : hepatitis B surface ( HBs Ag ) antigen , antihepatitis C virus ( antiHCV ) antibody , antihuman immunodeficiency virus 1 2 antibody ( antiHIV1 anti HIV2 Ab ) . Positive result urine drug screen ( amphetamines/methamphetamines , barbiturate , benzodiazepine , cannabinoids , cocaine , opiates ) unless result medical prescription . An IOP ≥36 mmHg time screening , baseline , randomization visit ( Day 1 predose ) . History ocular surgery ( include laser ) trauma either eye within 6 month screen visit . History glaucoma filter surgery aqueous shunt procedure ( traditional valve and/or microinvasive glaucoma surgery [ MIGs ] ) . History ocular infection within past 3 month ongoing recurrent ocular inflammation ( ie , moderate severe blepharitis , allergic conjunctivitis , herpetic keratitis , peripheral ulcerative keratitis , scleritis , uveitis ) either eye . Any ocular abnormality symptoms indicative ongoing ophthalmic disease ( except relate glaucoma OHT ) . Central corneal thickness &lt; 500 µm &gt; 620 µm baseline visit . Any evidence cornea guttata corneal endothelial dysfunction medical history baseline visit . Uncontrolled disease would interfere study conduct , interpretation study result , ability patient meet requirement study schedule . Any corneal abnormality prevent reliable applanation tonometry . Closed/barely open anterior chamber angle history acute angle closure either eye adequately treated peripheral iridectomy . Diagnosis clinically significant progressive retinal disease ( eg , diabetic retinopathy , advance agerelated macular degeneration , inherit retinal dystrophy ) either eye . Advanced optic nerve abnormality history visual field loss either eye base assessment Investigator could put patient risk glaucoma progression participate study . History aphakia , pseudophakia torn posterior lens capsule , macular edema , know risk factor macular edema either eye . The information intend contain consideration relevant patient 's potential participation clinical trial .</criteria>
