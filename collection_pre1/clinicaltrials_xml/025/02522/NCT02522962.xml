	<brief_title>Innovative Physiotherapy Coordination Care People With MS : RCT Qualitative Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research project first aim compare effect high-intensity individualized group-based core stability training ( GroupCoreSIT ) people MS standard care primary health care focus balance , walk , ADL , quality life cost-effectiveness . Secondly , project aim investigate patient ' experience participate intervention standard care , particularly address reflection regard content , relevance feasibility , change ADL , continuity care , self-management . The third aim investigate PTs act interact group conduct intervention , particularly individualization carry , PTs ' reflection participate education performance intervention . Finally , change patient ' pathway coordination represent another main objective project . The RCT : hypothesis , study outcome measure : High-intensity individualised group-based core stability training perform municipal PTs ' facility , complement home exercise , improve balance , walk , ADL , quality life cost-effectiveness . This reflect primary secondary outcome . RCT conduct collaboration outpatient clinic people MS Nordland Hospital Trust , Bodø , together six municipality Nordland County . The municipality include : Bodø , Rana , Meløy , Rødøy , Vågan Fauske . The out-patient clinic agree recruit participant send write invitation people MS select municipality , fulfil inclusion criterion . Six PTs expertise neurological physiotherapy agree conduct intervention . These PTs attend four day practical theoretical training intervention , 1-2 follow videoconferences study . A prospective RCT conduct , 72 person MS participate , undergo 6-week intervention , follow 6 month . Participants randomly assign two arm 1:1 ratio . Participants intervention arm A offer individualised group-based core stability training term GroupCoreSIT PTs facility , complement home exercise . Participants control arm B offer standard care . Significant improvement outcomes expect intervention arm compare standard care . Randomisation stratify European Disability Score Scale ( EDSS ) minimize selection bias preserve homogeneity arm . Randomisation data collation perform use Remote Data Entry ( WebCRF ) , Internet-based solution develop Norwegian University Science Technology ( NTNU ) . The researcher aim recruit subject within 5 month . After enrolment , PTs responsible perform intervention , conduct individual assessment participant arm A basis individualisation group base intervention . Each training group consist three participant . The training session last 60 minute , perform three day per week , six week , 10 5 pm . A total 32 exercise 5 level difficulty describe illustrated photo , available `` exercise bank '' . 10-12 repetition exercise good quality movement perform . Every session end active stretching/active relaxation instruction home exercise . The participant perform 30-minute exercise , optional divide small interval , home two day per week organize group training . Intervention arm A : participant perform train program : GroupCoreSIT facility municipal physiotherapist . Control arm B : participant control group receive standard care , i.e . follow ordinary physiotherapy service and/or routines/activities . Procedures test The trial restrict patient volunteer provided write informed consent accordance Declaration Helsinki Ethics Committee procedure . At enrolment , neurologist EDSS screening , medical history , type MS medication . An appropriately trained PT , also blind arm membership , perform standardize assessment participant use relevant test provide activity monitor . The following baseline information collect insert electronically WebCRF system use also randomize patient : 1 . Medical history , type MS , EDSS , age , gender , weight , height , medication , physiotherapy previous 6 month . 2 . Two primary outcome measure balance sitting , stand walk . 3 . Nine secondary outcome measure balance , waling , activity daily live ( ADL ) , quality life physical activity At 1 week , 3 month 6 month post intervention participant undergo standardize assessment perform baseline . Exercise , activity disease monitoring On weekly basis participant record : change medication , general wellbeing ( qualitative self-score ) , exacerbation , physical activity use diary . The ActiGraph monitor use 1 week prior intervention , 1 week post intervention follow 3 6 month test , demonstrate delivered subject test PT . In addition , participant arm A record : degree exhaustion follow group session ( Borg scale ) home exercise completion ( train diary ) . An intention-to-treat analysis perform randomised subject serve primary analysis outcome study . The data analysis carry use SPSS . Possible difference group baseline calculate use independent sample t-test continuous variable chi-square categorical variable . Primary outcomes , change balance walk group calculate use independent sample t-test . A cost-utility analysis conduct use healthcare system cost quality adjust life year ( QALYs ) . QALYs calculate base answer Health Questionnaire ( EQ-5D-3L ) use measure change patient ' quality life . The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ( ICER ) compute differential cost intervention arm standard arm study period , differential QALYs . Healthcare utilisation ( include hospitalisation , emergency department admission , outpatient visit , examination , primary care visit , rehabilitation ) relate cost collect hospital ' electronic patient journal ( DIPS ) , Norwegian Patient Registry The Norwegian Health Economics Administration 's ( HELFO ) system . This secondary outcome provide relevant knowledge regard new effective method organise healthcare service . This used basis decision make regard large-scale implementation rehabilitation . Patients ' experience : The patient ' experience intervention examine qualitative research interview . The interview conduct sample 8-10 participant intervention control arm twice ; end intervention 6 month post intervention . In accordance qualitative method , researcher select sample strategically promote breadth variety data production . Variation train group , EDSS , age , gender time since diagnosis consider important . The interview take place participant ' home another convenient place municipality . The interview topic include : first assessment/consultation , group situation , content training , intensity/quantity , pros con , home-exercises ADL . The number subject control group interview regard experience standard care , investigate topic . In order provide insight user ' experience beyond intervention period scope second interview : retrospective reflection regard wellbeing cop ADL period , intervention , self-management , continuity care , pros con regard intervention standard care . A theme-based interview guide use well audio recording interview . The material transcribe analyzed use Systematic Text Condensation apply phenomenology body , enactive theory complement neuroscience theoretical framework . Physiotherapists ' performance intervention experience : What PTs emphasize individual assessment prior first group session investigate observation videotape assessment one patient training group ( 12 observation ) . These observation complement qualitative research interview actual PT ( 12 interview ) illuminate PTs ' reflection regard assessment , plan group session , choice exercise goal individual . To investigate PTs ' tailor intervention situ , act interact participant , one session group observe videotaped ( 12 observation ) . To illuminate PTs ' reflection regard education intervention , experience conduct , particularly focus consideration regard goal attainment , individualization group set home exercise , PTs interview end training group period ( 12 interview ) . An observation guide , hand hold video-camera theme-based interview guide use well audio recording interview . The material transcribed analyse use Systematic Text Condensation apply phenomenology body , enactive theory complement neuroscience practice knowledge theoretical framework . Changes patient 's pathway coordination care : In 2007 The Northern Norway Regional Health Authority ( Helse Nord RHF ) report 650 person MS , select outpatient clinic 300 person enrol , prevalence incidence Nordland County recently increase high risk area MS . Courses newly diagnose person priority specialist care current offer complex rehabilitation , include high intensity physiotherapy provide rehabilitation unit UNN , The Rehabilitation Centre , Kurbad North Norway , Valnesfjord Rehabilitation Centre , supplement The National Hakadal MS centre . These institution currently characterise long wait list . A system early admission neurological physiotherapy , particularly high intensity program primary health care , establish within coordination care people MS . Referral municipality physiotherapy systematic , wait list primary health care long , service often general specifically address need people MS. To explore coordination care outpatient clinic people MS municipality regard high intensity physiotherapy , qualitative interview conduct select health personnel ( MS-nurses , neurologist , PTs , total 8-10 subject ) hospital ' outpatient clinic municipality ( general practitioner , PTs , total 8-10 subject ) , intervention ( standard care ) RCT ( new organizational model ) . The interview focus structure collaboration content service .</detailed_description>
