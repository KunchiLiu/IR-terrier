	<brief_summary>This clinical trail intend evaluate intervention base Infliximab trough level individualize therapy adaption pediatric IBD-patients undergo anti-TNF-alpha-therapy . Main aim individualize strategy attain maintain early disease control order keep many patient possible disease remission , avoid primary secondary therapy failure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TOPIT ; Trough Level Optimized Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease Therapy : A Multicenter Study Comparing Effectiveness Trough Level Optimized Infliximab Maintenance Therapy With Standard Dosing Regimen Pediatric Patients With Crohn 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anti TNF-alpha agent Infliximab efficient safe treat pediatric IBD-patients . However maintain remission therapeutic response still challenge practitioner . In addition relevant number primary non-responding patient individual clearance immunogenic effect lead secondary loss response significant number patient . So far patient clinically manage decrease infusion interval increase dose . Besides increase risk potential side effect high number patient need switch treatment biologicals despite intervention . Improved strategy need avoid primary secondary therapeutic failure , promise lead seem individualized therapy . Especially pediatric IDB-patients faster turnover anti-TNF base high metabolism rate new way adapt dose maintain therapeutic serum level necessary . In context role IFX-trough level fully clear . Previous study show serum IFX trough level correlate inversely turnover rate directly therapeutic response . Thus highly desirable keep trough level therapeutic window . In adult patient recent study show advantage use IFX-trough level therapy optimization , lead good disease control short long term . However clear evidence show benefit IFX-target-level approach maintenance therapy . An early therapy optimization begin rapid control mucosal inflammation seem set pathway sustained therapy response disease remission . We assume clear benefit individualize , IFX-trough-level guide therapy optimization pediatric IDB-patients intend clarify role Infliximab trough level plan trial .</detailed_description>
