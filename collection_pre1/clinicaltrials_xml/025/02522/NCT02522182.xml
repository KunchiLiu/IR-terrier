	<brief_title>ALLiance sEcondary PREvention After Episode Acute Coronary Syndrome ( ALLEPRE )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ALLEPRE enrol all-comers population resident Emilia Romagna diagnosis ACS ( unstable angina , non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction , ST segment elevation myocardial infarction ) admit specialist cardiological department participate centre 20 day index event . All eligible patient randomise 1:1 nurse-led intensive secondary prevention programme ( ISPP : intervention/experimental arm ) usual treatment ( UT : control arm ) . Randomisation centralise mean IVRS responsibility Study Coordinator Principal Investigator hospital centre , patient allocate group e-mail . Due nature study , neither participant research personnel blind group assignment . The randomisation data keep coordinate centre . OPERATIVE PHASE After randomisation , patient arm undergo baseline examination require return reference centre follow-up visit 12 , 24 60 month outcome assesment . Outcomes also record 36 48 month basis telephone enquiry . ISPP : intervention arm . This consist series program session involve centrally train nurse patient randomise ISPP . There total nine session : discharge , one , three , six , 12 , 18 , 24 , 36 48 month discharge . During session , last one hour , train nurse record main clinical parameter ( i.e . risk factor , lifestyle habit , adherence therapy , discrepancy patient report recommend goal ) use ad hoc clinical file ( SIM : scheda infermieristica multidimensionale multidimensional nursing form ) , activate intervention lay pre-specified rule inside SIM order correct discrepancy . The activation pre-established multidisciplinary network ( anti-smoking , anti-diabetes anti-hypertension centre , psychological support ) completely nurse ' control . Caregivers encourage support patient achieve behavioural change time . Adherence proven secondary prevention treatment monitor use Morisky scale order ensure follow class cardioprotective medication prescribe accord guideline dos use clinical trial : antiplatelet therapy , beta-blockers , angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor angiotensin II receptor blocker , statin . The reason non-adherence also investigate order ensure target intervention . The risk factor lifestyle behaviour goal stop smoking , eat healthy Mediterranean diet , undertake physical activity least 30 minutes/day five days/week , maintain body mass index ( BMI ) &lt; 25 kg/m2 , blood pressure &lt; 130/80 , LDL cholesterol level &lt; 70 mg/dL ( 1.81 mmol/L ) . A goal diabetic subject good glycemic control . The nurse also assess subject ' psychological characteristic mean questionnaire measure anxiety , depression , anger hostility , type A type D personality , perceive social support perceive self-efficacy , use ad hoc questionnaire referral psychologist necessary . To ensure nurse intervention partecipating center study start preliminary TRAINING PHASE involve professional nurse propose participate centre ( 6-10 per centre , 50 % hospital setting , 50 % community set ) . The training programme coordinate Training Continuous Education Centre Parma University Hospital , deliver multidisciplinary team medical/nursing/psychological expert aid ad hoc paper-based teaching material . It consist three 8-hour session hold consecutive day nurse train secondary CVD prevention take multi-dimensional structured responsibility ACS patient use appropriate communication strategy aim reduce risk factor , modify lifestyle improve adherence prescribe pharmacological therapy . The programme repeat four time order allow creation small group ( 20 participant ) good interaction . UT : control arm . The patient randomise control group follow standard secondary prevention hospital admit . DATA MANAGEMENT All data peripherally record electronic case report form store analysis . An external monitoring provide partecipating centrers clinical data verification , accuracy completeness electronic case report form . Sample size statistical aspect On basis result GRACE UK-Belgian Study , conservatively expect cumulative rate clinical endpoint standard care arm ( all-cause mortality , non-fatal reinfarction , non-fatal stroke ) five year ' follow-up 28 % . Using formula Lakatos Lan ( Statistics Medicine , 1992 ) , order detect 25 % risk reduction experimental group , 90 % power two-sided significance level 0.25 , least 1030 patient require group . However , two-year interim analysis major clinical endpoint show real divergence curve provide information estimating require duration study precisely . The estimated sample size also valid analysis first primary endpoint . The plan primary secondary analysis include Kaplan-Meier analysis time event , HR , log-rank comparison base ITT PP population . The baseline characteristic intervention control group compare use chi-squared test categorical factor Student 's test independent sample continuous factor . The data express mean value Â± standard deviation . All statistical analysis make use SPSS programme .</detailed_description>
