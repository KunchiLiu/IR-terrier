	<brief_summary>Background : Cancer-induced bone pain ( CIBP ) common people cancer . Bone cancer also lead anxiety , depression , reduce mobility quality life . Researchers believe research drug call resiniferatoxin ( RTX ) may able help . Objective : To learn whether RTX safe reduce cancer induce bone pain . Eligibility : People age 18 old CIBP relieve standard treatment Design : Participants 6 outpatient visit 7 month . These include : Medical history Physical exam Blood urine test . Thermal testing : disk place skin test ability sense temperature around area pain Chest x-ray EKG : sticker place chest measure heart signal ECG : measure electrical activity heart Participants 1 inpatient visit last 2-4 day . This include : Catheter insert vein arm . They give anesthesia , sedation , x-ray contrast . A needle pass skin back inject RTX . Participants keep log pain medication take surgery . Participants call 1 week 2 , 3 , 4 month injection . Participants mail survey questionnaires complete 2 , 3 , 4 month injection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Periganglionic Resiniferatoxin Treatment Intractable Pain Due Cancer-induced Bone Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cancer-induced bone pain ( CIBP ) common clinical problem.1 While primary osteosarcoma relatively uncommon , bone metastasis frequently cause cancer-related pain metastatic spread bone 60-84 % case . 2 Resiniferatoxin ( RTX ) ultrapotent agonist analog capsaicin target receptor express specific dorsal root sensory ganglion ( DRG ) neuron expect reduce pain within target zone . The overall program goal develop new treatment intractable chronic pain mid-thoracic level result CIBP control conservative treatment . Primary Objectives To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) RTX inject near one DRGs , characterize safety/toxicity profile identify dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) . Study Population Up 30 adult subject total across site estimate necessary enrollment order 16 subject receive RTX provide study-related assessment result 30-day time point . Design The study multicenter , open-label Phase 1b dose escalation safety efficacy trial adult subject intractable pain due CIBP mid-thoracic level meet eligibility criterion . Subjects undergone informed consent ( IC ) process sign approve IC form study assign Screen # ( S1 , S2 , etc. ) . Those subject meet inclusion exclusion criterion undergo various study procedure schedule unilateral periganglionic ( PG ) DRG injection ( ) ( maximum 3 contiguous level ) fluoroscopic guidance treat target DRGs demonstrate responsible chronic CIBP . Subjects screen failure prematurely terminate participation replace 16 subject receive injection ( ) complete study-related assessment day 30 ( D30 ) time point . Outcome Measures The primary outcome achieve dose-response relationship safety , although data pain reduction obtain secondary outcome measure . All subject receive RTX . There placebo group invasive nature injection dose escalation perform study . This dose escalation safety study base upon 4 progressive dose level ( 0.8 microg/ganglion ; 1.6 microg/ganglion ; 3.2 microg/ganglion , 6.4 microg/ganglion . The adaptive dose selection design employ establish primary outcome , MTD RTX . MTD define 1 dose level DLT observe one-third subject . The efficacy outcome variable evaluated establish dose-response curve , dose plot x-axis change efficacy endpoint ( D30 , D60 , D90 D180 treatment ) plot y-axis . If , end study , dose level RTX equal pain-relieving efficacy , Data Safety Monitoring Committee ( DSMC ) may determine appropriate include dose low 0.8 mcg and/or control group . On hand , dose-response curve show high dos could result great pain-relieving efficacy , protocol may amend include high dos RTX .</detailed_description>
