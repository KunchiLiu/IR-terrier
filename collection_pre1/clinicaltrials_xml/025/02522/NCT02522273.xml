	<detailed_description>A cardiotocograph ( CTG ) use labour assess heartbeat well-being baby . An abnormal CTG may sign baby low oxygen level ( hypoxia ) become distress . In situation blood test take scalp baby . A high lactate level high acidity ( low pH ) blood indicate urgent delivery require prevent long-term harm newborn . Obtaining scalp blood difficult , time consume high failure rate . In UK majority maternity unit ( include North Bristol NHS Trust ) use blood gas analyser measure lactate . These generally large , non-transportable device locate nearby maternity unit . The blood gas analyser require relatively large drop baby 's blood due 's fix location , require midwife leave delivery room process . Samples small contain air bubble blood clot reject need repeat . The process take twenty minute complete . After delivery blood umbilical cord routinely obtain high-risk delivery measurement pH lactate . This establish wellbeing baby time birth guide on-going treatment . Lactate sample also measure use blood gas analyser . SensPoint new medical device measure lactate . It several potential benefit current method measure lactate portable hand-held device ( allow use delivery room ) , require much small volume blood produce result quickly current method measure lactate . Before new device adopt clinical practice , important first confirm accurate reliable intend use . The researcher propose study evaluate ability SensPoint device accurately reliably detect lactate laboratory clinical set compare performance reference device currently use . The study divide three part : 1 . Comparison SensPoint device reference device laboratory prepared sample . 2 . Comparison SensPoint device reference device use small volume leftover blood umbilical cord blood test obtain routine care . 3 . Comparison SensPoint device reference device use small volume leftover blood foetal scalp sample obtain routine care . All foetal blood sample utilise study surplus clinical requirement would otherwise discard . Retrospective consent obtain . For purpose ensure validity , reliability repeatability device researcher test 90 laboratory standard sample , 90 arterial venous cord blood sample 90 foetal scalp capillary blood sample . This study enable research team design large study directly compare two method measure lactate , assess factor speed patient satisfaction .</detailed_description>
