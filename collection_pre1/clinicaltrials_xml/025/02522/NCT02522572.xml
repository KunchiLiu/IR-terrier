	<detailed_description>The investigator previously demonstrate proteasome inhibition ( bortezomib ) provide effective antihumoral therapy antibody-mediated rejection ( AMR ) desensitization kidney transplant recipient candidate . These study also demonstrate plasma cell population exhibit significant heterogeneity . Newly produce plasma blast plasma cell , whether primary anamnestic immunologic response , acute AMR , sensitive proteasome inhibitor-based therapy . Of plasma cell population examine , demonstrate great degree resistance proteasome inhibitor therapy reside within bone marrow niche . These long live bone marrow niche resident plasma cell ( LLBMNRPC ) population demonstrate significant degree resistance bortezomib therapy . This concept plasma cell niche provide long term survival signal support substantial literature murine model . A number signal involve derive plasma cell niche think contribute long live plasma cell survival include CXC-chemokine receptor 4 ( CXCR4 ) /chemokine ( C-X-C motif ) ligand 12 ( CXCL12 ) interaction , Interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) , B cell activate factor ( BAFF ) , cluster differentiation 44 ( CD44 ) . In addition , number cell demonstrate involved plasma cell niche either human murine model , include eosinophil , osteoclast , bone marrow reticular cell , amongst others . Interruption CXCR4/CXCL12 interaction plerixafor use induce cluster differentiation 34+ ( CD34+ ) bone marrow stem cell mobilization peripheral blood . Since CXCR4/CXCL12 interaction also think responsible plasma cell home bone marrow niche , hypothesize plerixafor may also provide systemic mobilization bone marrow niche resident plasma cell , alternatively , may induce local mobilization bone marrow niche plasma cell . Given previous study indicate mobilization long live plasma cell think result short term ( le 72 hour ) survival long live plasma cell , represent significant potential enhancement proteasome inhibitor-based plasma cell target therapy . Indeed , previous abstract oncology literature provide preliminary evidence combine plerixafor bortezomib therapy may use mobilize malignant myeloma cell bone marrow niche , thereby enhance sensitivity bortezomib . The purpose propose study conduct proof concept preliminary safety evaluation plerixafor alone also combine therapy plerixafor bortezomib . The investigator prospectively conduct meticulous assessment bortezomib-related toxicity transplant recipient AMR transplant candidate desensitization population recently publish Transplantation . This experience , include 100 treated patient , indicate toxicity profile bortezomib quite comparable observed myeloma population . The investigator ' preliminary analysis plerixafor bortezomib base toxicity demonstrate significant degree overlap toxicity significant reason concern regard combinatorial toxicity priori . The investigator ' extensive phase I/II study bortezomib-based desensitization without rituximab-based memory B-cell depletion and/or plasmapheresis provide substantial experience first line approach first generation plasma cell target therapy desensitization kidney transplant candidate . The current proposal first initiation second generation plasma cell target protocol substantial potential application beyond kidney transplant candidate . These type regimen may also lend AMR desensitization kidney transplant recipient also heart solid organ transplant recipient . It also possible second generation plasma cell target protocol may also use desensitization kidney transplant , heart transplant , solid organ transplant population . Finally , plasma cell target therapy may also use autoimmune disease autoantibody think represent major pathogenetic factor .</detailed_description>
