	<detailed_description>Few neurological condition scientifically mysterious clinically , legally , ethically challenge disorder consciousness ( DOC ) . Typically develop severe brain injury , set related condition include Coma , Vegetative State ( VS ) Minimally Conscious State ( MCS ) . In past 20 year , increase amount research break many convention disorder , include widespread belief patient entirely apallic - , lack kind `` high '' activity . Since , show lot brain activity , include relatively high-level cognitive process , remain DOC patient . Nonetheless , date exists standard intervention patient suffer devastating condition . Developing intervention population extremely important first foremost well-being patient , - today - remain completely dependent assist care , often unable participate rehabilitative program lack behavioral responsiveness , thus find prisoner condition characterize uncertainty medical , legal ethical decision-making level . In addition , condition , last indefinitely , also place great emotional monetary strain family , large burden care-takers - often lead increase rate burn-out - large financial stress medical structure public finance due large cost impose prolonged intensive care . The present project aim evaluate potential non-invasive Low Intensity Focused Ultrasound Pulsation ( LIFUP ) thalamus ( key area consciousness network ) neurorestorative stimulation patient severe brain injury . LIFUP perform two session ( one occur deep sedation stop second one occur discharge ) . The propose experiment involve behavioral ( i.e. , CRS-R ) paramedical ( i.e. , MRI/fMRI EEG ) measurement two LIFUP session ( i.e. , 5 non-consecutive minute stimulation session ) small sample patient ( 15 ) order evaluate feasibility full scale clinical trial . Outcome measure ( i.e. , GOSE CRS-R ) administer discharge , 6 month one year injury . The duration participation study year . In term impact , think project would number immediate consequence . ( ) A successful pilot study indication approach might hypothesize effect would place u unique position initiate fully-fledged double-blind clinical trial large cohort patient . ( ii ) From purely scientific point view , virtue test today prominent physiological hypothesis concern loss recovery consciousness severe brain injury , project direct repercussion understand mechanism underlying condition . ( iii ) From clinical patient management point view present project first necessary step towards open completely new avenue care-taking patient suffer devastate condition intervention . In particular , project successful long run ( e.g. , double-blind full clinical trial ) , could make widely available non-invasive protocol could substitute currently highly invasive ( therefore widely available , high risk ) intervention available .</detailed_description>
