	<detailed_description>Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) chronic disease affect ~1 % population . A large proportion patient establish disease persistent high disease activity spite exist effective pharmacological treatment . Improved treatment thus urgently need , include alternative treatment addition optimal pharmacological therapy . The main purpose study investigate high intake blue mussel ( Mytilus Edulis ) could decrease inflammation disease activity patient establish RA . A secondary goal identify novel biomarkers blue mussel intake metabolic response diet , use metabolomics approach high sensitivity specificity . A third goal look genetic polymorphism relation LCPUFA inflammatory marker . Diet lifestyle associate chronic disease cardiovascular disease , cancer diabetes . Here , evidence base dietary treatment guideline available . In contrast , inflammatory disease RA dietary guideline exist , reflect ambiguous evidence base . Many dietary component related human immune system inflammation . Some co-factors immune- inflammatory response , zinc . Others antioxidant , eg selenium , vitamins E C. RA associate low serum concentration zinc , selenium , vitamins D B6 although may reflect inflammatory response . Dietary effect RA symptom report long chain fatty acid fish probiotic show improve function RA patient . As prebiotics reduce inflammation condition , may positive effect also RA . Most research antioxidant focus single nutrient dietary trial also conduct mixed result . In sum , high-quality study evaluate effect combination food item indicative effect RA need . Blue mussel rich vitamin ( B2 B12 ) mineral ( iron , selenium zinc ) contain LCPUFA eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) .</detailed_description>
