	<brief_summary>Almost one-fifth US adult current cigarette smoker . To make progress lower prevalence , would help increase proportion smoker attempt quit . This application test novel approach motivate smoker quit , base empirically support theory anxiety . The approach use guided imagery increase smoker ' sense urgency prevent negative health consequence smoking .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Approach Participants Eligibility Criteria The investigator plan enroll 290 participant , recruit via newspaper , radio , online ad , flyer distribute community , letter healthcare provider . Ads recruit adult smoke least 10 cigarettes/day willing participate two session four week apart mention smoke cessation . Prospective participant must meet follow criterion phone screen : 1 . Adults ( age 18 old ) . 2 . Daily cigarette smoker ( least 10 cigarette per day ) . 3 . Total score 5 Modified Mini Screen score 0 suicidality item . 4 . Fluent English . 5 . Not plan leave Washington , DC area next month . The Modified Mini Screen ( MMS ) safety precaution loom vulnerability induction , average increase state anxiety . Those score 6 high MMS consider moderate high risk anxiety , mood , psychotic disorder . The MMS modification MINI appear work equally well men woman Caucasians African Americans ; investigator use low ( conservative ) cutoff score recommend basis research validate MMS full diagnostic interview ( SCID ) . Prospective participant exclude basis offer therapy departmental training clinic , well alternate local referral , outside context research project . Fluency English necessary valid completion assessment . Planning remain metropolitan area help low attrition rate . Procedure Eligible participant choose enroll study schedule in-person assessment imagery experiment . The following chart show measure complete assessment : Measure Experiment 4-week follow-up Expired air CO X X State anxiety ( VAS ) X ( pre/post imagery induction ) Demographics X Smoking smoke cessation history X Nicotine Dependence ( FTND ) X X Visualization ability ( VVIQ ) X Contemplation Ladder X X Stage change algorithm X X Current ( past month ) smoking rate X X Self-efficacy ( SSEQ ) X X Outcome expectancy ( SCQ-A ) X X Most accessible outcome expectancy ( SGO ) X X Vividness rating imagery X Perception health consequence smoke looming ( CSCLS-P ) X Quit attempt ( &gt; = 24 hour ) X Description quit attempt method use , length , etc . X Sensation Seeking ( SSS-V ) X First session : Baseline assessment experiment loom vulnerability induction . After complete informed consent , participant complete expire air CO test corroborate smoker status ( &gt; = 9 ppm ) . If smoker status confirm , pay time excuse ineligible . Participants eligible interested complete baseline measure one four random order : Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) state anxiety . State anxiety measure single-item VAS participant make mark along 100 mm horizontal line anchor phrase `` Not All '' leave ( 0 ) `` Extremely '' right end ( 100 ) , word `` Anxious '' print line middle ; score number millimeter leave end participant make mark . VAS measure proven useful indicator state anxiety smoking research . Demographics , smoke history , quit history , current ( past month ) smoking rate measure brief , face-valid questionnaire . The investigator use previous study 10-item measure current smoking rate , year smoking , length long recent attempt quit smoke . This measure similar , bit detailed , Active Smoking Questionnaire downloadable NCI website . It adapt study ass e-cigarette use , rapidly increase , least one-third US adult smoker ever use e-cigarettes . Nicotine dependence indexed Fagerstrom Test Nicotine Dependence ( FTND17 ) , 6-item scale moderate internal consistency predictive validity relation abstinence study varenicline . Visualization ability measure revised Vividness Visual Imagery Questionnaire ( VVIQ2 ) . Respondents ask form image specific scene rate vividness . Validity data favorable . For example , high scorer likely notice change make picture show . Sensation seek measure revise Sensation Seeking Scale-V . This forced-choice self-report measure show high internal consistency extensive evidence concurrent validity relate attitudinal behavioral criterion theoretically associate sensation seek . Contemplation quit measure two way . The Contemplation Ladder ( CL ) consist ladder rung label 1 10 . The low score ( 0 , bottom rung ) represent `` think quit '' , whereas high score ( 10 ) reflect `` take action quit ( e.g. , cut , enrol program ) '' . In national population-based study smoker initially interested quit immediately , CL score predict make quit attempt response intervention . Also , self-reports use stage smoker accord algorithm ( intention quit within next six month = precontemplators ; intend quit next six month next 30 day = contemplators ; intend quit next 30 day = preparers ) . Self-efficacy measure Smoking Self-Efficacy Questionnaire ( SSEQ ) , 17-item self-report measure confidence one 's ability resist temptation smoke various high-risk situation . SSEQ score show predict length time first relapse smoking cessation attempt . Outcome expectancies smoke measure two way . First , premise highly accessible expectancy regard smoking may influential determine smoking-related behavior , `` Self-Generated Outcome ( SGO ) '' test call completion stem `` When I smoke cigarette , I expect â€¦.. '' , cod base solely first response . Scores sensitive current mood smoking status . Second , Smoking Consequences Questionnaire-Adult ( SCQ-A ) well-validated 55-item self-report measure expect consequence cigarette smoke . Experimental manipulation loom vulnerability . After complete baseline measure , participant randomly assign either loom condition control condition ( use pre-selected random order generate via www.randomizer.org , condition unknown experimenter point ) . The randomization stratify sex whether participant ever make attempt quit smoking previously . The imagery scenario condition ( loom control ) one use McDonald et al . present one four random order . Posttest measure : manipulation check hypothesize mediator : After imagery exercise , participant complete second state anxiety VAS immediate manipulation check , along rating vividness imagery . They complete CSCLS-P ( see description validity evidence preliminary study section ) measure perception physical health consequence smoke loom threat . This measure test hypothesized mediator effect imagery induction quit attempt . Advice quit . At completion assessment , experimenter give participant ( regardless experimental condition ) handout contain brief advice quit smoking , along write information ( ) quitnet.com free site could use obtain community support extensive information concern nicotine replacement therapy , medication , behavioral method cop high-risk situation , preparation quit date , , well ( b ) telephone-based counseling provide free via 1-800-QUIT-NOW . Four-week follow-up assessment . Four week later second session , participant complete CL algorithm measure indicator contemplation status well expectancy measure . Participants also report smoke rate quit attempt since first experimental session . Quit attempt primary outcome , investigator also consider change smoke rate meaningful . If participant claim make quit attempt , ask duration attempt whether still effect ( i.e. , whether currently abstinent , include e-cigarette use give health implication switch e-cigarette use remain uncertain . Participants complete expire air CO test , abstinence consider corroborate read &lt; 8 ppm . To minimize demand effect , four-week follow-up session always conduct research assistant ( ) conduct time 1 assessment ( b ) mask experimental condition participant . The protocol follow-up follow : 1 . Interview regard quit attempt least 24 hour since lab experiment . If one attempt , detail seek concern long attempt last , whether ongoing , method use . The remain measure retests baseline : 2 . Current smoking rate . 3 . Nicotine dependence . 4 . Expired air CO reading . 5 . Contemplation quit smoking . 6 . Self-efficacy 7 . Outcome expectancy .</detailed_description>
