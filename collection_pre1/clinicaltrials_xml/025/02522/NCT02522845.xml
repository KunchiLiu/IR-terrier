	<brief_summary>This study look effect compression therapy patient endovenous treatment truncal incompetence varicose vein use either radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) endovenous laser therapy ( EVLT ) . Patients randomise either compression group ( group A ) compression group ( group B ) . The pain score , compliance , quality life score , occlusion rate 6 month well cost effectiveness intervention assess .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Varicose vein common know affect approximately one third population . Chronic venous disease ( CVD ) show negative impact quality life patient treatment varicose vein demonstrate lead improvement quality life patient . Over past decade , new endovenous technique introduce felt cost-effective , especially , perform outpatient 'office-based ' setting . There currently uncertainty use compression stocking follow treatment varicose vein . In consensus statement 2008 , International Union Phlebology ( IUP ) state good evidence use compression certain clinical indication . These include management telangiectasia sclerotherapy , varicose vein pregnancy , prevention thromboembolism heal ulcer . However , question remain unanswered , length treatment level compression used6 . The Society Vascular Surgery American Venous Forum recommend use compression stocking post-operatively 1 week prevent haematoma formation , pain swelling . The 2013 NICE Guidelines Varicose Veins Legs recommend use compression hosiery 7 day interventional treatment varicose vein . However , due current uncertainty compression bandage hosiery compare compression interventional treatment varicose vein , NICE Guideline Development Group advocate research evaluate clinical cost effectiveness post-procedure intervention . The guideline also suggest look length time compression bandage worn show beneficial . Several researcher look practice use compression venous ablation . In survey management varicose vein member Vascular Society Great Britain Ireland , Edwards et al . find majority surgeon use bandage post-operatively , 49 % use elastic bandage . The literature use compression stocking follow treatment varicose vein limit . Between December 2006 February 2008 , Bakker colleague conduct prospective randomise control trial use compression stocking endovenous laser ablation great saphenous vein . One hundred nine patient approach 93 finally randomise use compression stocking 2 day ( Group A ) 7 day ( Group B ) , respectively . All patient follow 3 month post-treatment visual analogue scale ( VAS ) pain record 48 hour , 1 week 6 week . A physical examination quality life assess 1 week 6 week . Occlusion rate 3 month point also evaluate . Physical function vitality show significantly well group B 1 week follow-up , statistically significant difference 6 week . At 1 week , also note VAS score group B ( VAS score 2.0 ± 1.1 ) significantly low patient wear compression stocking 48 hour ( VAS score 3.7 ± 2.1 ) ( p≤0.001 ) 10 . No significant difference , however , observe 6 week post-procedure . Limitations study include high drop trial ( 40 initial 109 approach ) absence phlebectomy sclerotherapy patient . Elderman et al . carry randomised trial ass effect compression stocking endovenous laser therapy ( EVLT ) great saphenous vein incompetence . Patients ' report pain score quality life score evaluate day procedure , 2-3 day afterwards 2-6 week post-procedure . A total 111 patient randomised stocking ( n=55 ) stocking ( n=56 ) . There statistically significant difference pain score favour stocking group day 7 , difference longer present week 6 . There also great use analgesia patient stocking group compare patient wear stocking ( p &lt; 0.05 ) . In addition , patient wear stocking report statistically significantly high score satisfaction 2 day ( 4.44 vs 4.15 ) 6 week ( 4.59 vs 4.18 ) . The absolute difference , however , small . Two notable limitation study high level drop out ( 16 group ) absence blind . Hamel-Desnos et al . undertook randomise control trial look effect compression patient receive foam sclerotherapy saphenous vein . They note patient compression similar pain quality life score patient wear compression . They conclude additional use compression impact effectiveness obliteration vein , satisfaction score , symptom quality life , control trial need answer question whether use compression result difference outcome varicose vein procedure . The investigator , therefore , propose undertake multicentre randomise study look effect compression therapy endovenous thermal ablation . Description This multicentre randomise clinical trial look impact wear wear compression stock follow endothermal ablation ( either endovenous laser treatment ( EVLT ) radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) ) incompetent truncal vein . Those require concurrent phlebectomy foam injection exclude . Patients randomise group A ( compression ) group B ( compression ) . Only use compression randomise decision treatment use discretion clinical team . Target Population Patients refer treatment symptomatic varicose vein recruit find primary great saphenous ( GSV ) small saphenous vein ( SSV ) incompetence colour duplex scan . Intervention Patients randomise compression ( group A ) compression ( group B ) . The compression therapy use Class II compression stocking . The treatment offer endothermal ablation ( either endovenous laser treatment ( EVLT ) radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) ) incompetent truncal vein . Concurrent phlebectomy foam sclerotherapy carry . Patients randomise group A ask wear compression stocking 1 week . Patients randomise group B provide compression . At baseline , patient ask fill quality life questionnaire ( EQ-5D , AVVQ CIVIQ ) clinical score assess ( CEAP VCSS ) . On discharge varicose vein intervention , provide diary record post-procedural pain every day 10 day use validated visual analogue scale ( VAS ) well record return normal activity back work . They also ask attend follow-up 2 week 6 month . Patients ' GP also send letter inform patient 's participation study . Follow-up Patients follow outpatient clinic 2 week 6 month . Follow-up 2 Weeks At 2 week ' follow-up , diary containing detail pain score soon patient able return normal activities/work collect . In addition , patient ask bruise phlebitis two week procedure compliant compression . They examine Venous Clinical Severity Score ( VCSS ) record . They also ask fill EQ-5D , AVVQ CIVIQ score . Follow-up 6 Months At 6 month follow-up , patient examine VCSS record . They also ask fill EQ-5D , AVVQ CIVIQ score . They venous Duplex scan determine occlusion treat vein . Sample Size Study Duration The sample size need observe difference least 10mm VAS score standard deviation 20mm estimate . With power 90 % 5 % significance equivalence , 174 patient ( 87 per group ) need recruit . Previous study look compression stocking show drop rate close 37 % 3 month . Therefore , drop rate 50 % 6 month occurs , least 348 need recruit . If 7 patient recruit per week , approximately 364 patient could potentially randomise year . With 6 month follow-up , therefore , study run 18 month target recruitment 350 patient . Settings Two hospital trust London recruiting patient study . These : 1 . Imperial College NHS Trust 2 . North West London Hospitals NHS Trust</detailed_description>
