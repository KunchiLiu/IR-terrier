	<brief_summary>The primary objective outcome proportion participant compliant ( least four hour use per night night ) Auto Bilevel group compare continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) group 90 day treatment investigation . Proportion calculate use cumulative number hour therapy divide total number day investigation participant . The mean standard deviation mean therapy hour calculate arm investigation . Participants compliance least four hour classify `` compliant '' le four hour classify `` non-compliant '' . The null hypothesis reject mean primary objective outcome participant BiPAP® Auto Bi-Flex® therapy ( auto Bilevel ) arm significantly great participant CPAP therapy arm</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Auto Bilevel Adherence Following Poor Initial Encounter With Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ( CPAP )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Initial Screening It prefer participant 's recruited morning fail clinical CPAP titration lab . Participants able enrol within ninety day follow failure circumstance preclude approach consent morning titration failure . Participants ask wear Actiwatch approximately seven day prior clinical titration polysomnogram ( PSG ; seven day prior final visit . ) Actiwatch worn participant 's wrist ass sleep continuity . Participants ask press `` Marker button '' Actiwatch get bed night document time mark device download . Participants also ask fill sleep diary ( provided sleep clinic ) seven day ( 14 day total ; 7 begin study 7 day prior 90 Day visit ) use Actiwatch . Randomization/Therapy Initiated ( Visit # 1 ) Participants randomize schedule BiPAP® Auto Bi-Flex® titration CPAP titration night lab . General therapy titration guideline document Appendix I &amp; II ( see Appendix I &amp; II end document ) . Heart Rate Variability ( HRV ) assess diagnostic portion titration portion research PSG . During diagnostic portion research PSG , HRV need assessed ten minute participant awake . At end titration portion research PSG , HRV need assessed ten consecutive minute participant awake . Enrolled participant complete questionnaire ass functional outcome sleep quality ( FOSQ ) , Epworth Sleepiness Scale ( ESS ) , Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) mask comfort satisfaction therapy , Psychomotor Vigilance Task ( PVT ) , attitudes toward use measurement , Fatigue Severity Scale ( FSS ; see Appendix III description measurement ) . Participants set respective machine titration within ten day ( 10 +/- 2 ) day titration take device home next three month . Thus , total participation trial average 3-4 month . All positive airway pressure machine include program SmartCard monitor objectively compliance . Participants randomized standard CPAP therapy receive SmartCard program provide CPAP prescribed pressure . Both participant sleep health staff administer questionnaire psychomotor vigilance task , blind therapy SmartCard program provide . Participants randomize novel therapy receive SmartCard program provide BiPAP® Auto Bi-Flex® . The SmartCard program do unblinded study staff member . The setting novel therapy : - Min Expiratory Positive Airway Pressure ( EPAP ) = 4 cmH2O prescribe CPAP ≤ 10 cmH2O ( use 6 cmH2O prescribe CPAP &gt; 10 cmH2O ) - Max Inspiratory Positive Airway Pressure ( IPAP ) = 25 cm H2O - Min Pressure Support ( PS ) = 2 cm H2O ( adjust ) - MaxPS = 8 cm H2O - Bi-Flex set 3 The SmartCard insert device provide program therapy . Both participant CPAP therapist blind therapy SmartCard program provide . The supply necessary use therapy home also provide participant ( i.e . mask , tube , humidifier , etc. ) . The CPAP therapist also provide train necessary use device home provide number call case participant encounter difficulty use device home . Standardized Counseling Optimize Adherence Therapy Counseling optimize adherence CPAP therapy consist : 1 . The clinician discus complaint regard CPAP therapy identify potential contributor poor adherence therapy . The standardized counseling optimize adherence include follow measure address patient complaint concern : Interface - Assure current mask properly apply headgear properly adjust . - Persistent mask leak mask discomfort , skin trauma , skin irritation address first verify mask headgear adjustment mask size . An alternate mask use problem address fit adjustment intervention . - If mouth leak primary concern nasal mask use , nasal/oral mask consider chin strap offer combination nasal mask use . Therapy Side Effects - All patient initially place CPAP device heat humidification . For continued oro-pharyngeal dryness , nasal dryness , nasal congestion , rhinitis , humidification increase . Saline nasal spray , steroid , decongestant prescribe , need . - Dyspnea CPAP claustrophobia address counseling need . - Note : Reducing prescribed pressure improve adherence consider time . 2 . A standardized description obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) risk review participant , well American Academy Sleep Medicine Fact Sheet Drowsy Driving ( see Appendix III ) . 3 . A standardized description evidence regard benefit positive pressure therapy treat OSA review participant . Participants instruct use device much possible sleeping also make sure allow adequate opportunity sleep night .</detailed_description>
