	<brief_summary>1 . Purpose objective : Determine spectroscopic difference tumor , dysplasia , normal cutaneous tissue assess histopathologic diagnosis . If successful , optical measurement could use survey delineate extent malignancy noninvasive manner . 2 . Study activity population group : Competent adult clinically suspicious skin lesion undergo biopsy part routine care . For agree participate , sterilize portable optical spectroscopic probe use measure diffuse reflectance lesion clinical interest . 3 . Data analysis risk/safety issue : The optical spectrometer breach skin defense barrier . As study involve noninvasive optical measurement tissue , significant safety concern anticipate . Qualitative analysis perform describe whether correlation spectroscopy measurement pathologic diagnosis . A variety correlative statistic explore determine relationship find justify large study</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This pilot study determine optical spectroscopy characteristic tumor patient cutaneous malignancy . These spectroscopy measurement compare pathological diagnosis tissue biopsy site . If successful , optical measurement could use survey delineate extent malignancy noninvasive manner . This would especially helpful clinic visit suspicious lesion see would otherwise require biopsy diagnosis . Immediate benefit would include patient numerous suspicious skin lesion would require multiple biopsy . Further spectroscopy measurement tumor site adjacent normal tissue therapy ( chemoradiotherapy radiotherapy ) may provide useful information pertinent tumor physiology therapeutic effectiveness .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients least one clinically suspicious skin lesion warrant biopsy part routine care , outpatient clinic setting . Patients previous histologically confirm malignancy basal cell carcinoma squamous cell carcinoma eligible ; however require enrollment . The suspicious skin lesion ( ) accessible optical probe measurement . If patient previous histologically confirm malignancy skin , primary tumor site must accessible optical probe measurement Patient able provide write informed consent Patient &gt; 18 year age &lt; 18 year age Unable provide write informed consent</criteria>
