	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine additional panretinal photocoagulation ischemic area follow retinal vein occlusion ( RVO ) may reduce rate recurrence allow longer treatment interval anti-Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor ( VEGF ) treatment follow `` trea-and-extend '' scheme .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation `` Treat-and-extend '' Scheme Patients With Retinal Vein Occlusion ( RVO ) With Without LASER Treatment Ischaemic Retinal Areas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients macular edema follow RVO receive anti-VEGF treatment injection Ranibizumab 12 month `` treat-and-extend '' scheme . Following scheme , patient receive series three injection interval 4 week . Thereafter , retreatment interval determine result certain examination . The next control include reinjection schedule extension one week patient present sign recurrence . Assuming time recurrence interval long , next control ( follow retreatment ) schedule one week sooner last control . Following treatment schedule , individualized retreatment interval thereafter keep steady . Half patient receive additional panretinal photocoagulation visit 3 / 4 . Aim study investigate additional panretinal photocoagulation may result long individualized retreatment interval correspond reduce rate recurrence macular edema .</detailed_description>
