	<brief_summary>Dexmedetomidine selective Î±2 adrenergic receptor antagonist , little effect respiratory suppression use sedative agent . Also , dexmedetomidine report prolong anesthesia time use patient undergoing spinal anesthesia . However , dexmedetomidine sympathetic effect cause hypotension bradycardia dose dependently . Therefore , study aim evaluate effectiveness premedication anticholinergic agent vital sign patient undergoing spinal anesthesia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Anticholinergic Premedication Sedation With Dexmedetomidine During Spinal Anesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Before enter operation room , patient randomize one group ( A C ) . For sedative premedication , patient inject intramuscularly midazolam 1mg . After enter operation room , patient monitor blood pressure , ECG oxygen saturation . Before induction spinal anesthesia , patient load plasma solution 5mL/kg . After induction spinal anesthesia , block level check . After fixation block level , load dose ( 0.6ug/kg ) dexmedetomidine dilute normal saline 4ug/mL would start 10 minute . However , start dexmedetomidine , atropine .01~0.03mg/kg 0.5mg would inject group A . Otherwise normal saline 0.5mL would inject group C. The syringe would blind noticed . After load dexmedetomidine , dilute solution would inject 0.25ug/kg/hr end surgery . Every patient undergoing sedation would apply oxygen nasal prong . The heart rate decrease 30 % initial heart rate 40/min would regard bradycardia need treatment , atropine 0.5mg injected intravenously . Systolic blood pressure decrease 30 % basal blood pressure 90 mm Hg would regard hypotension need treatment , ephedrine 5mg injected intravenously . The number medication treat would note .</detailed_description>
