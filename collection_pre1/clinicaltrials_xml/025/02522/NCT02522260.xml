	<brief_summary>This study woman breast cancer chemo- hormonal therapy compare effect different physical training program physical mental well-being systemic inflammation mechanism blood . In sub-group participant , mitochondrial biogenesis function molecular process skeletal muscle biopsy study . The woman randomly allocate three different intervention arm , control arm usual care two different training arm . All participant respond questionnaire blood sample take subgroup muscle biopsy exercise intervention . Participants support uphold exercise collaboration Friskis &amp; Svettis follow 5 year . Some woman also ask participate depth interview experience exercise ongoing treatment . This study contribute increase knowledge type , intensity frequency training patient breast cancer benefit regard impact physical mental wellbeing . This knowledge great importance since experience show patient relative often seek information rehabilitation , self-care physical activity . The study also contribute improvement patients´ quality life , ability return work , reduce social cost , , increase possibility development implementation evidence-based rehabilitation woman breast cancer active treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Purpose The main aim , woman undergo chemotherapy breast cancer , explore different train intervention impact physical capacity psychological well . Research question - Does regular PA improve ability return work breast cancer treatment complete ? - How woman breast cancer chemotherapy treatment respond control supervised aerobic fitness training combination aerobic fitness training strength train physiological , structural molecular outcome measure muscular strength , aerobic fitness , muscle mass , mitochondrial density , gene activity muscle B-Hb , s-CRP blood variable , ? - Is difference woman aerobic exercise training group , combine aerobic strength-training group control group regard symptom distress health relate quality life ? - Is adherence physical exercise impact individual ' personality ? - Are remain effect physical exercise intervention , survival morbidity , 5 year treatment complete ? Study design method Participants A total 240 woman recruit Department Oncology Breast Sarcoma unit Radiumhemmet Södersjukhuset , Karolinska University Hospital . Inclusion criterion : patient 70 year breast cancer Stage I-IIIa start chemotherapy . Exclusion criterion : patient advanced disease , patient physical activity consider contraindicate medical reason heart lung disease , brain bone metastasis , cognitive dysfunction , patient speak understand Swedish language . Randomization The Clinical Trials Unit ( KPE ) Radiumhemmet , Karolinska Universitetssjukhuset , conduct inclusion study randomization . The participant allocate either two different train group control group . The participant also randomize muscle biopsy ( n=45 ) intervention ( see flowchart ) . Group 1 ) include strength train large muscle group ( 2 set , 8-12 repetition intensity 80 % 1-RM ) aerobic exercise ( 80 % HR-max ) exercise bike treadmill twice week 16 week . Group 2 ) include aerobic exercise exercise bike treadmill ( intensity 70 % HR-Max ) twice week 16 week . Group 3 ) control group , get standard information around physical activity treatment supervise training . Data Collection Data collect study participant regard demographic diagnosis , cancer treatment , laboratory sick leave data ( patient-reported ) , relapse , survival , co-morbidity cause death relevant register . - Data collection demographic data occurs ( randomization ) intervention , three time point : 1 year , 2 year 5 year treatment complete . Baseline 5 week surgery initiation chemotherapy . - All participant accept participation study undergo rest ECG examination provide response small , targeted set heart disease history question . - Strength muscular endurance measure instrument JAMAR dynamometer , measure muscle strength hand . This assess study participant intervention . The instrument good reliability validity . - Before intervention aerobic fitness ( VO2-max/kg body weight/min ) participant intervention group assess submaximal exercise test . - Blood sample muscle biopsy procedure take place KPE lab Radiumhemmet , Karolinska University Hospital , Solna . Muscle biopsy obtain local anesthesia m. vastus lateralis ( approximately 100 mg ) Bergström needle . This take place intervention start 24-72 hour last training session . Mitochondrial density expression gene important muscle adaptation analyze . Concurrently , venous blood sample genotyping , analysis white cell distribution epigenetic pattern marker systemic inflammation . - Physical activity level energy consumption determine ActiGraph GT3X ( Actigraph ) . Actigraph combine heart rate sensor accelerometer continuously collect data . The method previously test show good reliability validity . In project participant three group carry Actigraph seven day , intervention . An Activity Diary daily subjective report physical activity also use intervention period . Instruments - Piper Fatigue Scale assess fatigue four dimension . The scale show psychometric property reliable assess subjective dimension fatigue among Swedish population cancer patient . Data collect study participant ( intervention control ) randomization intervention , 1 year , 2 year 5 year treatment . - Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale ( MSAS ) assess 32 common cancer-related symptom . The instrument validate Swedish patient breast cancer . Data collect study participant randomization intervention , 1 year , 2 year 5 year treatment . - EORTC QLQ-C30 cancer-specific instrument measure health-related quality life term physical , emotional , social , cognitive everyday function . Data collect study participant randomization intervention , 1 year , 2 year 5 year treatment . - Sense coherence ( SOC ) questionnaire , show person see world life comprehensible , manageable meaningful . Individuals strong sense coherence able mobilize resource manage health illness treatment . SOC short version consist l3 question participant complete start treatment . The Swedish version SOC-13 show good validity reliability . It also demonstrate high internal consistency . Qualitative interview • Individual interview about/around experience physical activity associate chemotherapy treatment carry 15 participant . An open question ask , `` Can describe experienced period training ? '' . Because nature question , woman freedom narrate story , interview focus element surface significant . Supplementary question ask create depth understand phenomenon . Data Analysis Muscle blood analysis The molecular exercise physiology lab fully equip store muscle biopsy biological material . Many method set-up muscle lab others perform different core facility . Molecular biochemical analysis : Skeletal muscle biopsy sample obtain percutaneous needle technique . Apart direct analysis gene activity , protein content epigenetic marker , primary muscle cell extracted biopsy . Extraction total RNA : Total RNA extract frozen muscle use acid phenol method . Standard procedures laboratory use : conversion cDNA , mRNA level quantify use Q-PCR RNASeq global analysis ( SciLife Lab , Joachim Lundeberg ) protein level analyse Western Blot . Bioinformatics analyse perform lab professor Jesper Tegnér . Quantitative Collected quantitative data analyse use parametric statistic normally distribute data non-parametric statistic non-normally distribute data . Subgroup analysis conduct focus type treatment . Power Calculation : variable muscle strength thighs maximal oxygen uptake , select significance level 0.05 , power 0.80 = 240 patient recruited total detect statistical difference medium effect size . From 45 participant project , plan take muscle biopsy train intervention . For repeat biopsy part patient serve control , mean believe current patient number sufficient part project . Qualitative Qualitative data individual interview 15 patient analyzed inductive content analysis . Workplan Data collection currently ongoing 80 patient include study . With current inclusion rate 240 participant include end 2015 . To support woman uphold PA treatment complete collaboration initiate Friskis &amp; Svettis Stockholm , five year follow period encompass FaR ( physical activitiy receipt ) invitation motivational healthy life style session three time year , session also include information longterm effects/symptoms treatment support self care .</detailed_description>
