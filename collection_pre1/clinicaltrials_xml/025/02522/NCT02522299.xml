	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate specific alteration immune cell mechanism relate neutrophil function detect PI3Kdelta-dependent change messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA ) extract induced sputum patient experience exacerbation COPD , without treatment GSK2269557 . The efficacy treatment GSK2269557 also measure use functional respiratory imaging ( FRI ) spirometry . This randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel-group study . The study consist Screening Phase ( 3 day prior Day 1 ) , Treatment Phase ( Days 1 84 ) Follow phase ( 7 14 day last dose ) . The total duration study 13-14 week include screen visit .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Between 40 80 year age inclusive , time signing informed consent . The subject confirm establish diagnosis COPD , define Global Initiative Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease ( GOLD ) guideline least 6 month prior entry . The subject able produce &gt; 100 milligram ( mg ) sputum screen processing , ( ie , total weight sputum plug ) . The subject postbronchodilator FEV1/FVC &lt; 0.7 FEV1 &lt; =80 % predict . Predictions accord European Community Coal Steel ( ECCS ) equation OR European Respiratory Society Global Lung Function Initiative reference equation document last 5 year . Disease severity : Acute exacerbation COPD require escalation therapy include corticosteroid antibiotic . Acute exacerbation confirm experienced physician represent recent change least two major one minor symptom , one major two minor symptom , 3 major symptom . Major symptom : Subjective increase dyspnea ; Increase sputum volume ; Change sputum colour . Minor symptom : Cough ; Wheeze ; Sore throat The subject smoker exsmoker smoke history least 10 pack year ( pack year = [ cigarette per day smoked/20 x number year smoke ] ) . Body weight &gt; = 45 kilogram ( kg ) body mass index ( BMI ) within range 18 to32 kilogram per meter square ( kg/m^2 ) ( inclusive ) Male Female subject : eligible participate pregnant ( confirm negative urine human chorionic gonadotrophin [ hCG ] test ) , lactate , least one follow condition applies : ( 1 ) Nonreproductive potential define : Premenopausal females one following : Documented tubal ligation ; Documented hysteroscopic tubal occlusion procedure followup confirmation bilateral tubal occlusion ; Hysterectomy ; Documented Bilateral Oophorectomy . Postmenopausal define 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea . Females whose menopausal status doubt require use , use , one highly effective contraception method specify 30 day prior first dose study medication completion followup visit . 2 ) Reproductive potential agrees follow one option list GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) Modified List Highly Effective Methods Avoiding Pregnancy Females Reproductive Potential ( FRP ) requirement 30 day prior first dose study medication completion followup visit . GSK Modified List Highly Effective Methods Avoiding Pregnancy FRP . This list apply FRP sex partner , prefer usual lifestyle subject continue abstinent penilevaginal intercourse long term persistent basis . 1 ) Contraceptive subdermal implant meet GSK standard criterion include &lt; 1 % rate failure per year , state product label . 2 ) Intrauterine device intrauterine system meet GSK standard criterion include &lt; 1 % rate failure per year , state product label . 3 ) Oral Contraceptive , either combined progestogen alone . 4 ) Injectable progestogen . 5 ) Contraceptive vaginal ring . 6 ) Percutaneous contraceptive patch . 7 ) Male partner sterilization documentation azoospermia prior female subject 's entry study , male sole partner subject . 8 ) Male condom combine vaginal spermicide ( foam , gel , film , cream , suppository ) . These allow method contraception effective use consistently , correctly accordance product label . The investigator responsible ensure subject understand properly use method contraception . Specific inclusion criterion Male subject female partner reproductive potential outline : Male subject female partner child bear potential must comply follow contraception requirement time first dose study medication completion follow visit . 1 ) Vasectomy documentation azoospermia . 2 ) Male condom plus partner use one contraceptive option : Contraceptive subdermal implant meet GSK standard criterion include &lt; 1 % rate failure per year , state product label . Intrauterine device intrauterine system meet GSK standard criterion include &lt; 1 % rate failure per year , state product label . Oral Contraceptive , either combined progestogen alone . Injectable progestogen . Contraceptive vaginal ring . Percutaneous contraceptive patch . These allow method contraception effective use consistently , correctly accordance product label . The investigator responsible ensure subject understand properly use method contraception . Capable give sign informed consent include compliance requirement restriction list consent form protocol . To avoid recruitment subject severe COPD exacerbation , presence one follow severity criterion render subject ineligible inclusion study : Need invasive mechanical ventilation ( short term [ &lt; 48 hour ] Noninvasive ventilation [ NIV ] continuous positive airway pressure [ CPAP ] acceptable ) ; Haemodynamic instability clinically significant heart failure ; Confusion ; Clinically significant pneumonia , identify chest Xray screening , judge Investigator . Subjects current medical condition disease well control , judge Investigator , may affect subject safety influence outcome study . ( Note : Patients adequately treat well control concurrent medical condition ( e.g . hypertension noninsulindependent diabetes mellitus [ NIDDM ] ) permit entered study ) . Subject diagnosis active tuberculosis , lung cancer , clinically overt bronchiectasis , pulmonary fibrosis , asthma respiratory condition might , opinion investigator , compromise safety subject affect interpretation result . ALT &gt; 2xupper limit normal ( ULN ) bilirubin &gt; 1.5xULN ( isolated bilirubin &gt; 1.5xULN acceptable bilirubin fractionate direct bilirubin &lt; 35 % ) . A subject clinical abnormality laboratory parameter ( ) is/are specifically list exclusion criterion , outside reference range population study may include Investigator [ consultation GSK Medical Monitor require ] document find unlikely introduce additional risk factor interfere study procedure . Current chronic history liver disease , know hepatic biliary abnormality ( exception Gilbert 's syndrome asymptomatic gallstone ) ECG indicative acute cardiac event ( e.g . Myocardial Infarction ) demonstrate clinically significant arrhythmia require treatment . QTcF &gt; 450 msec QTcF &gt; 480 msec subject Bundle Branch Block , base single QTcF value . Subjects undergone lung volume reduction surgery . Subject currently chronic treatment macrolides long term antibiotic . Subject treat long term oxygen therapy ( LTOT ) ( &gt; 15 hours/day ) . The subject chronic treatment antiTumour Necrosis Factor ( antiTNF ) , immunosuppressive therapy ( except corticosteroid ) within 60 day prior dose History regular alcohol consumption within 6 month study define average weekly intake &gt; 28 unit male &gt; 21 unit female . One unit equivalent 8 gram ( g ) alcohol : halfpint ( ~240 milliliter [ mL ] ) beer , 1 glass ( 125 mL ) wine 1 ( 25 mL ) measure spirit . History sensitivity study medication , component thereof ( lactose ) history drug allergy , opinion investigator Medical Monitor , contraindicate participation . A know ( historical ) positive test human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) antibody . Presence hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) , positive hepatitis C antibody test result screen within 3 month prior first dose study treatment . NOTE : Because short window screening , treatment GSK2269557 may start receive result hepatitis test . If subsequently test find positive , subject may withdraw , judge Principal Investigator consultation Medical Monitor . Where participation study would result donation blood blood product excess 500 mL within 56 day . The subject participate clinical trial receive investigational product within following time period prior first dose day current study : 30 day , 5 halflives twice duration biological effect investigational product ( whichever longer ) . Exposure 4 investigational medicinal product within 12 month prior first dose day .</criteria>
