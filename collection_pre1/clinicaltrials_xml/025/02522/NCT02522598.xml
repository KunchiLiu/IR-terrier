	<brief_summary>VVZ-149 novel analgesic drug candidate show potential analgesic activity inhibit GlyT2 5HT2A simultaneously . These target receptor know play important role induction transmission pain signal . There many effort develop selective drug treat pain , usually unsuccessful due lack efficacy limitation single-target approach new drug discovery . VVZ-149 expect dual-target drug , demonstrate potential synergism GlyT2 5HT2A maximize antinociceptive effect vivo animal model . In Phase 1 conduct among healthy subject , safety tolerability confirm . Phase 2 design randomize , double-blind , parallel-group , placebo-controlled trial evaluate efficacy safety analgesic drug VVZ-149 injection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>VVZ-149 dual antagonist GlyT2 5HT2A . GlyT2 blockage increase inhibitory synaptic transmission glycine spinal cord , result reduction pain transmission brain . 5HT2A blockage decrease descend serotonergic facilitatory modulation pain transmission brain reduces nociceptor activation peripheral nerve , primary source pain post-surgical pain . VVZ-149 show comparable efficacy morphine well control ( blind , complete randomization positive control ) animal study use rat model post-operative pain formalin-induced pain . The PK/PD study animal indicate therapeutic plasma concentration human subject 600-1,900 ng/ml . A clinical Phase 1 study perform healthy subject show clinically significant adverse event plasma concentration level 3,261 ng/ml brief symptom mild nausea dizziness , mild somnolence plasma exposure level 2,000 ng/ml .</detailed_description>
