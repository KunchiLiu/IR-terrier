	<brief_summary>This short pilot study assess tolerance preterm infant , bear 32 week gestation respiratory distress syndrome , flow-cycle ventilation , see infant require less overall pressure ventilator usual conventional setting use , aim provide data construct large trial look long term outcome infant use type ventilation future . Many preterm infant gestation require assistance ventilator due immaturity lung . The lung preterm infant susceptible damage , especially high pressure need prolonged period ventilation . There concern infant 's breathing pattern synchronise ventilator , cause additional distress , long duration ventilation need increase risk complication . Over past 20 year , different type ventilation , know flow-cycle ventilation , trialed , limited use preterm infant . This allow baby determine duration breathe many breath require per minute . This would help baby synchronise good ventilator , consequently require less pressure ventilator . This pilot study conduct St. Mary 's Hospital , Manchester . All baby bear 32 week gestation , stable respiratory effort , eligible consideration study . The study last long 5 hour involve baby receive different pressure ventilator flow-cycle mode 1-hour epoch . Blood gas epoch continuous ventilator data download assess tolerance different setting , return usual conventional setting use unit . The baby continuous monitor throughout per standard neonatal intensive care .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study conduct short term , crossover study , infant act control undertake intervention within study . The study break two part order answer two secondary research question . The limited study look flow-cycled ventilation preterm baby set similar manner . Making infant control limit number infant need pilot study . 1 . Prior preparation regard protocol design The protocol already review University Leeds , paper submission viva determine suitability project educational point view suitability restrict time frame resource available . Discussions neonatal unit technical support staff already undertaken ensure study ventilator ( exact model use unit , mobile ) configure require backup ventilation mode , maintain require level breathe support , safety alarm setting check Eview box ( device allow collection data baby ventilator ) instal per manufacture guideline . Training also give Principal investigator setup maintenance study ventilator ( principal investigator also member clinical team use ventilator daily basis aware use ) . 2 . Prior clinical care give &amp; assessment eligibility Prior study , eligible baby would breathe tube insert surfactant medication give due concern underdevelop / immature lung , fit bear early gestation . They would receive breathe support Engstrom Carestation Version 5.X ( GE Healthcare ) ventilator , ventilator use study , would receive dose caffeine citrate intravenously aid infant 's breathing drive , line unit policy international consensus manage respiratory distress syndrome preterm infant . The clinical team may deem necessary monitoring blood sample inserted catheter one infant 's artery ( arterial line ) , though requisite study , would use monitoring sample study infant suitable . As per routine practice , infant two method monitor time . This would monitor oxygen saturation heart rate well monitor blood pressure , breathe rate temperature deem necessary . As Principal Chief Investigators member clinical team neonatal intensive care unit St. Mary 's Hospital , easy highlight suitable infant study patient list admission unit , though prior discussion take place attend neonatal team discus suitability . For infant deem potentially suitable discussion attend clinical team , parent information leaflet give parent time greet &amp; introduce study , receive update baby 's progress date . As much time possible allow introduction attempt answer question obtain write consent ( minimum one hour ) allow parent uncoerced thinking time . During time , research team corroborate attend nurse / clinician review clinical data infant , include x-rays do time , nurse observation blood gas result , order ass inclusion exclusion criterion . An eligibility form complete signed member research team clinical team ensure agreement eligibility . If concern , infant recruit time . At appropriate time parent , approach Principal Chief Investigator question answer study . The research team happy parent understood information , implication , alternative free make choice ( well eligible consent legally ) . If infant suitable , consent form complete . Randomisation occur take seal study envelope study box find order undertake different part trial , allocate study number , use documentation pertain study , ensure anonymity . ( The study box would already pre-made sealed envelope contain information generate random number database . The process randomisation prevents influence final result purely due order study part undertaken , make study robust analyse . This previous concern study literature ) . The study ventilator ( exact model ventilator use unit ) set safety check undertake , well Eview box ( box allow ventilator data extract analysed though interference work ventilator ) instal , safety back-up mode enable ensure infant sufficient breathe support ventilator event maintain strong breathing pattern , study number weight child accurately enter ventilator research team . The researcher examine infant ensure time commence study infant still satisfy criterion inclusion deem 'stable ' blood gas sample take baby ( either pre-sited arterial line available capillary foot accord standard practice ; distress amount blood minimise cause instability ) . This sample analyse machine routinely use intensive care unit , blood test infant may need ( e.g . blood sugar monitoring , usually do every 2-4 hour stage ) perform time / sample blood ( possible ) minimise distress intervention . A special nursing observation chart commence time attend nurse / research team , record routine observation ventilate infant would require . This first set observation ( pre-study ventilator setting ) would baseline setting , allow deviation stability highlight act upon early . 3 . First part study The infant would switch onto study ventilator , process take less second , involve disconnect old ventilator tube breathe tube reconnecting new ventilator tubing . This necessary order Eview box work ( original ventilator would turn short period time , would ethical leave baby without control breathe support ) . Care would take dislodge breathe tube whilst infant examine ensure chest rise ventilator receive data infant . The time ventilator would note observation chart aid data analysis later . Depending randomisation , infant would either receive high pressure low pressure study ventilator . - All setting would match infant beforehand possible . ( The high low pressure pre-set base pressure infant require study either 80 % ( low pressure ) 120 % ( high pressure ) limit deem safe within acceptable clinical practice ) . - The infant would remain set 1 hour . - Their nursing observation record every 15 minute , include blood pressure arterial line read continuously ( unusual practice baby would receive intensity observation blood transfusion ) . After end hour , blood gas would take , ventilator would switch setting ( either low pressure , infant previously receive high pressure , vice versa ) . The process would repeat term timing observation take . The time ventilator would note analysis purpose pressure switch . After second hour , blood gas would repeat infant place back initial ventilator , set appropriate condition infant time . This complete first part study infant would resume routine care least hour . A blood gas would take 1 hour per usual convention ensure stable settle back onto initial ventilator . 4 . Second part study After 1 hour back standard ventilator , infant would reassess ensure stable . If case , state , blood gas would take part two study commence . The observation record would provide baseline second part study . The infant would switch back study ventilator time note . Depending initial randomisation , infant would either receive time-cycled ventilation ( usual convention ) flow-cycled ventilation ( part one study ) study ventilator . - All setting would match infant beforehand possible . - The infant would remain set 1 hour . - Their nursing observation record every 15 minute , include blood pressure arterial line read continuously . After end hour , blood gas would take , ventilator would switch setting ( either flow-cycled , infant previously receive time-cycled , vice versa ) . The process would repeat term timing observation take . The time ventilator would note analysis purpose pressure switch . After second hour , blood gas would repeat infant place back initial ventilator , set appropriate condition infant time . This complete second final part study infant would resume routine care duration stay unit . A blood gas would take 1 hour per usual convention ensure stable settle back onto initial ventilator . 5 . After completion study After study complete , would handover care back attend clinical team update clinical team parent ( present ) regard clinical condition baby . Regarding data , encrypted flash disk remove study ventilator data download NHS computer unit . This data , along nurse observation chart blood gas result , review independent consultant neonatologist safety quality assurance prior second baby undergo study . The researcher responsible ensure study ventilator clean appropriately line manufacture unit guideline ready future participant . 6 . Safety intervention These highlight main issue question break protocol due safety concern . It clear protocol need do concern . Only one baby undergo study one time concern review researcher .</detailed_description>
