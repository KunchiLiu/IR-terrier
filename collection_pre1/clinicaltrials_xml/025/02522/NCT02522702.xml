	<brief_summary>The aim study develop computer program able distinguish adenomatous non- adenomatous polyp basis optical feature polyp . Still image polyp ( &lt; 10 mm size ) collect routine colonoscopy procedure . All polyp resect endoscopically histopathological diagnosis ( gold standard ) notify . In validation phase study computer program establish aim distinguish adenomatous non- adenomatous polyp basis optical feature derive still image . The program operate use random forest learn method . Afterwards , test phase study , still image 100 polyp ( use validation phase ) present computer program . The establishment well- functioning computer program primary aim study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Adenomas polyp colorectum potential develop colon cancer [ 1 ] . However , adenomas never become malignant , progression adenoma cancer usually take long time . As result , screen colonoscopy program establish order detect resect adenomas early stage [ 2 ] . After resection , polyp send pathology order make histological diagnosis . Not every colorectal polyp adenomatous histology . Approximately 40-50 % polyp contain benign histology ( e.g . hyperplastic inflammatory polyp ) . These polyp bear risk colon cancer . The implementation screen program lead increase number colonoscopy last year [ 3 ] . This approach naturally imply high amount detect polyp . The removal polyp consultation pathologist order make diagnosis time consume expensive . An optical- base prediction polyp histology ( adenomatous versus non- adenomatous ) would enable endoscopists save money inform patient faster examination result . The approach predict polyp histology basis optical feature call `` optical biopsy '' method . The prediction make endoscopists real-time colonoscopy . The aim strategy make optical diagnosis enable user resect polyp without send specimen pathology . Narrow Band Imaging ( NBI ) light-filter device switch colonoscopy . NBI useful well display vascular pattern colon mucosa . It show use NBI facilitate optical classification colorectal polyp [ 5 ] . A NBI- base classification scheme exist used assign polyp specific polyp category ( adenomatous versus non- adenomatous ) [ 6 ] . Prior implementation optical classification approach routine use endoscopy necessary proof feasibility accuracy [ 7 ] . Otherwise approach would entail risk wrong diagnosis could lead wrong recommendation diagnostic therapeutic step . Until , clinical trial show good accuracy optical biopsy method [ 5 ] . However , grow evidence optical biopsy yet meet demanded accuracy threshold [ 8 ] . The aim study create computer program able distinguish adenomatous non-adenomatous polyp . Still image colorectal polyp include NBI- picture polyp use machine learning ( validation phase ) . Afterwards set 100 still picture use test whether computer program able distinguish adenomatous non- adenomatous polyp ( primary endpoint ) . Statistical measure ( accuracy , sensitivity , specificity ) calculate .</detailed_description>
