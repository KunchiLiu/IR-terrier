	<brief_summary>Postoperative atrial fibrillation atrial flutter ( POAF ) common complication cardiac surgery require intervention prolong hospital stay . POAF associate high mortality high risk thromboembolic event . However , It yet unknown whether event postoperative atrial fibrillation indication chronic arrhythmic disease - tendency towards develop recurrent atrial fibrillation merely response stress surgery recurrence . This distinction critical determine appropriate therapy . Since recurred event atrial fibrillation ( Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation ) associate long term risk stroke thromboembolic even patient PAF treat long term anticoagulation . Missing long term recurrence arrhythmia may result under-treatment pose significant risk stroke . Bio-Monitor subcutaneous implanted device automatically detect arrhythmias store electrocardiogram ( ECG ) recording . It enable detection atrial fibrillation period year allow correct diagnosis appropriate treatment . The purpose study study long term behavior POAF , determine likelihood develop paroxysmal atrial fibrillation patient POAF define risk factor eventuality</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Clinical background : Postoperative atrial fibrillation atrial flutter ( POAF ) common complication cardiac surgery require intervention prolong hospital stay . Affecting 10-65 % patient , arrhythmia associate increased mortality , considerable morbidity include systemic therombo-embolism hemodynamic deterioration . Often prolong hospital stay increase health cost . Notably , incidence POAF increase result increase average age arrhythmic risk factor patient undergo cardiac surgery . Although lot POAFs occur patient history PAF , important portion POAF patient never experience AF . In patient POAF may first manifestation tendency fibrillate ( may silent prior surgery ) whereas others may acute response peri-operative stress may never recur acute phase . A recent study show patient first detect AF episode precipitate secondary event ( common cardiothoracic surgery ) likely recurrent event . In fact risk recurrence similar patient AF event obvious precipitate factor Current guideline mainly address acute management arrhythmia . Most conclude anti-thrombotic therapy indicate POAF ( IIA ) usually arrhythmia persists least 48 hour . However recommendation base limited evidence substantial data describe long term natural history complication . POAF describe self-terminating frequently recurrent complete resolution within 6-12 week . However , observation base electrocardiogram follow-up continuous long term monitoring ( ECG holter loop recorder ) therefore limited validity . Emerging data suggest AF recurrence rate may significate range 24 % 6 year . Still , currently unknown many patient present acute episode POAF develop recurrent event , result , clear recommendation regard duration anticoagulantion treatment . The current practice case POAF significant duration administer anti-coagulation therapy combine antiarrhythmic ( often amiodarone ) 6-12 week . The guideline base recommendation base poor evidence administer OAC AF patient follow CABG least 3 month . Holter ECG routinely perform prior end period normal clinical evaluation normal treatment discontinue , usually additional evaluation . Technical overview : This study execute use follow device service : - BioMonitor subcutaneous implanted device automatically detect arrhythmias store electrocardiogram ( ECG ) recording . It implant small subcutaneous pocket , similar pacemaker without need insert electrode . It provide high quality ECG record longevity 6.4 year . In addition wireless capability may transmit data external modem ( CardioMessenger ) though internet base network - Home-Monitoring . - HomeMonitoring Internet-based , automatic , remote , monitoring system use cellular phone network enable transmission record data alert HM Service Center predefined email address , fax cellular phone . Study propose The investigator hypothesize intermediate long term burden newly diagnose POAF significantly great currently describe . We hypothesize may marker affect atrium represent great risk chronic arrhythmia . Therefore , believe substantial group patient present POAF atrial fibrillation recurrence ( paroxysmal , persistent permanent ) require long term anticoagulation We also believe help ILR able define subgroup POAF patient POAF relate acute phase prone recurrence need long term anticoagulation In pilot study propose use ILR diagnose symptomathic asymptomatic event atrial fibrillation subject cardiac surgery . We intend define natural history post-operative atrial fibrillation identify predictor recurrent event . Study aim : 1 . To evaluate incidence recurrent AF event , long term follow-up patient present newly diagnose POAF discharge sinus rhythm . 2 . To identify predictor development recurrent AF event 3 . To verify use implantable loop recorder ( ILRs ) tool detection AF anticoagulant management POAF 4 . To evaluate rate mortality major adverse event ( CVA , systemic thromboembolism , rapid AF require hospitalization ) among patient present POAF discharge sinus rhythm . 5 . To identify predictor mortality major adverse event . Methods - general Study design - pilot • A multicenter , prospective randomize , open label interventional study - Participants randomize ratio 2:1 implantation loop recorder usual follow - Participants follow median 2 year . - Country primary site - Israel Study population - Participants recruit patient admitted cardiac surgery ward participate medical center - Participants recruit index hospitalization within week discharge Recruitment &amp; randomization 1 .
