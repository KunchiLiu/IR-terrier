	<detailed_description>Physical therapist important role initial contact provider individual musculoskeletal disorder . Health care expenditure rise year U.S. large proportion due musculoskeletal disorder . Despite rise spending , improvement outcome individual musculoskeletal disorder . Furthermore , increase medical spending utilization could expose patient iatrogenic harm . Comparative effectiveness study different portal entry would help determine effective pathway individual musculoskeletal disorder seek care . The purpose study determine whether patient musculoskeletal injury well see primary care provider first versus see physical therapist first . Subjects enrol two site ( Temple University , Philadelphia , PA Brooke Army Medical Center , San Antonio , TX ) . Patient self-reported outcome measure collect baseline 6 week . At 6 month , healthcare utilization assess . The investigator plan enroll target sample size 75 subject per site ( 150 total ) . Descriptive statistic compute characterize 2 treatment group ANCOVA use assess difference treatment group 6 week , adjust baseline value , evaluate assumption parallel slop . The investigator investigate source systematic difference response treatment use method generalize estimate equation linear mixed effect model . This research first multi-site study compare effectiveness two pathway individual musculoskeletal pain U.S. With grow old adult population , percentage individual musculoskeletal pain U.S. increase time . This research study timely could meet need identify effective pathway individual musculoskeletal pain seek care .</detailed_description>
