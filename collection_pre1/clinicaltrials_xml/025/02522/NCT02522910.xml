	<detailed_description>This study part conduct open-label , non-randomized , Phase I conventional 3+3 dose-escalating design define safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics , MTD BAY 1000394 ( Roniciclib ) give 3 day / 4 day schedule combination docetaxel subject second- third-line NSCLC . The number subject treat dose-escalation part depend number dose- escalation de-escalation step need determine MTD BAY 1000394 ( Roniciclib ) combination docetaxel subject population . Subjects treat recommended phase II dose level within Phase Ib part study include response evaluation Phase II part .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Screening must perform within 14 day prior first dose study drug . Subjects eligible inclusion study follow criterion meet : Histologically cytologically confirm stage IIIB IV NSCLC Patients receive prior 1 2 line systemic anticancer therapy . For EGFR mutate ALK rearrange patient , EGFR TKI ALK inhibitor also consider line systemic therapy Documented progressive disease platinumcontaining doublet chemotherapy ( Platinumcontaining chemotherapy give neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy , definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy within 6 month consider one line chemotherapy ) For patient show nonprogressive disease 1st line platinumdoublet chemotherapy , continuation maintenance therapy consider line therapy , whereas switch maintenance therapy consider another line therapy . EGFR mutate ALK rearrange patient eligible one line EGFR TKI ALK inhibitor platinumdoublet chemotherapy . Any prior systemic anticancer therapy must complete least 3 week prior initiation study medication . Palliative radiation , whole brain radiotherapy ( WBRT ) , gamma knife surgery ( GKS ) brain metastasis must complete least 2 week prior initiation study medication . Major minor surgery must complete least 4 2 week prior initiation study medication , respectively . Majority minority surgery decide investigator 's discretion . Any acute toxicity must recover Grade ≤ 1 ( except alopecia ) . Male female subject age ≥18 year Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 01 Adequate bone marrow , liver , renal function assess follow laboratory requirement conduct within 14 day prior first dose study drug : At least one measurable lesion base RECIST 1.1 Availability tumor tissue molecular analysis mandatory ( presence archival tissue rebiopsy acquisition tumor tissue strongly recommend ) Subjects exclude study display follow criterion : Prior radiotherapy ( local palliative radiotherapy permit must occur ≥2 week subject must Grade 3 4 toxicity prior first dose study treatment ; palliative define intended cure relieve symptom reduce suffer ) Eligibility local therapy ( surgery radiotherapy ) Previous treatment CDK inhibitor docetaxel Current ongoing administration anticoagulation antiplatelet therapy . However , use lowdose aspirin ( ≤100 mg/day ) and/or lowdose heparin permit unless use condition cancer Known hypersensitivity study treatment excipients preparation agent give association study Previous deep vein thrombosis ( within last 6 month ) , arterial thrombotic event ( include stroke ) , pulmonary embolism History cardiac disease : Congestive heart failure New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class III IV angina ( within past 6 month prior study entry ) , myocardial infarction , cardiac arrhythmia require antiarrhythmic therapy ( beta blocker digoxin permit ) Active clinically serious infection NCICTCAE v4.0 &gt; Grade 2 Known human immunodeficiency virus infection , active hepatitis B C , chronic hepatitis B C require treatment antiviral therapy Seizure disorder require therapy ( steroids antiepileptic ) Symptomatic metastatic brain meningeal tumor , include spinal cord , include case neoplastic meningitis ( also know symptomatic carcinomatous meningitis leptomeningeal carcinomatosis ) . However , WBRT GKS symptomatic brain leptomeningeal metastasis , subject stable 2 week without steroid dosage anticonvulsant stable 2 week , eligible . Asymptomatic central nervous system metastasis eligible subject abnormal finding neurologic examination receive corticosteroid therapy control symptom . History organ allograft Evidence history bleed disorder , ie hemorrhage / bleed event NCICTCAE v4.0 &gt; Grade 2 within 4 week prior first dose study treatment Uncontrolled hypertension ( systolic blood pressure &gt; 150 mmHg diastolic blood pressure &gt; 90 mmHg despite optimal medical management ) Serious , nonhealing wound , ulcer , bone fracture ( bone fracture due bone metastasis acceptable )</criteria>
