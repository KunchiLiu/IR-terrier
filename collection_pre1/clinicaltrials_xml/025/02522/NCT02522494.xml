	<brief_title>Encouraging Patient-Centered Communication Clinical Video Telehealth Visits</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Clinical video telehealth ( CVT ) offer opportunity efficient access high quality primary specialist care Veterans . Enthusiasm CVT especially high VA give geographical separation many Veterans provider VA Medical Centers . However , CVT encounter nature less personal in-person visit , communication CVT visit may challenge patient provider result less patient-centered communication . Less personal visit may less exchange information , low satisfaction , less trust , poorer outcome . Indeed , research compare CVT in-person consultation find patient CVT visit passive CVT interaction dominate provider compare in-person visit . This project leverage prior work two HSR &amp; D-funded pilot project improve provider - patient communication Veterans type 2 diabetes mellitus . In short-term project , SHP-08-182 , investigator conduct focus group elicit understand patient ' barrier communicate provider . This qualitative work use subsequent pilot project , PPO-08-402 develop educational video encourage Veterans use active participatory communication visit provider . This work successfully complete product 10-minute video , test , find acceptable feasible show VA patient immediately precede medical encounter . Objectives : The investigator goal project develop test video intervention also develop pamphlet patient provider encourage active positive communication CVT medical interaction . The investigator goal develop support project 's operational partner Office Telehealth Services integral goal ensure patient-centered care new model care . Patient-centered communication medical interaction critical play important , often overlook , role delivery health service . There two aim . First , investigator develop educational intervention encourage patient provider use active communication behavior CVT visit . Second , investigator conduct randomize trial video pamphlet ( intervention ) vs. pamphlet alone ( comparison ) two-arm randomized effectiveness trial . The investigator evaluate improvement visit outcomes include patient provider measure patient-centered care communication , reduction several common barrier clinical improvement , improve medication adherence measure hemoglobin A1c . In addition , investigator assess mediator moderator relationship intervention condition outcome . Methods : The project two phase . In initial phase propose project investigator develop video intervention . Video development include qualitative interview stakeholder patient regard CVT barrier perceive benefit . The investigator use several exist resource expert panel co-investigators consultant bring element together produce intervention . In phase 2 investigator conduct randomize trial intervention , evaluate improvement number outcome . Impacts : The educational tool deliverable could use prior CVT visit improve communication could serve paradigm develop communication aid medical condition clinical setting . The investigator evaluate whether educational intervention help improve communication associate well visit intermediate outcome . Educational tools encourage patient-centered communication CVT encounter may allow rapid acceptance CVT , thereby improve access healthcare enhance operational mission project 's partner .</detailed_description>
