	<brief_summary>Nowadays increasingly quest improved physical appearance , gradually develop medicine beauty , radio fit additional tool help age process maintenance body shape . The aim study evaluate compare change thickness adipose tissue blood level biochemical marker sedentary active woman underwent radio frequency technique via ultrasound image laboratory test . Seven ( 7 ) session hold , last 20 minute , 22 volunteer allocate two group , sedentary physically active . Measures ultrasound image collect baseline , pre-treatment post-treatment period period serum biochemical parameter ( lipid profile , liver kidney ) pre-treatment post-treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Radiofrequency Located Adiposity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The demand treatment localize adiposity reduction increasingly gain ground beauty clinic due constant search perfect body current standard beauty . The localized adiposity characterize hypertrophy unilocular fat cell occur part body , especially flanks abdomen often food program combine physical activity enough require complementary treatment redefinition body shape . The radio frequency non-invasive technique emits electromagnetic wave generate heat skin layer . The technique indicate treatment edema fibro geloid ( EGF ) , wrinkle , sag also observe lipolytic effect act directly level accumulate fat cell help reduce fat layer . With vision , investigator seek evaluate effect Radio Frequency localize f patient fat abdominal region , compare group sedentary woman group woman engage physical activity . Also evaluate biochemical anthropometric parameter provide indication effect radio frequency human body . This pilot study . The sample consist 30 female volunteer participate , respect criterion inclusion exclusion previously cite read signing Informed Consent Clarified . The sample consist 30 participant , divide two group , 15 individual regular exercise practitioner 15 sedentary , participant group undergo 4-week control period first ( base period ) second ( pre-treatment ) evaluation . Participants instructed change respective routine activity . For physical activity practitioner perform least 150 minute aerobic exercise moderate intensity week , least 75 minute vigorous physical activity , even combine physical activity moderate vigorous intensity week . Both group make 12 session individual radio frequency application , twice week , total 6 week treatment . To monitor result , diagnostic ultrasound use measure fat layer . To collect individual supine position pillow lumbar spine . The head position navel fat thickness measure inner layer skin aponeurosis rectus abdominis muscle middle Alba line area . To measure fatty layer flank head umbilicus displace laterally individual still supine position . The head transverse plane ask individual hold air exhalation collect image . The fat thickness measurement make linear probe ( 7.5 MHz ) depth 4 5cm . The parameter use study previously test show health risk . Among method use assess body composition , electrical bioimpedance widely use , especially high speed processing information , noninvasive method , practical , reproducible , estimate , addition body component , distribution fluid intracellular extracellular space , well quality , size cell integrity . For assessment body composition , Bioelectrical impedance analysis ( BIA ) technique base model cylindrical conductor length uniform homogeneous cross-cutting area , human body resembles . Evaluations shall perform professional training experience type analysis . For examination , use Maltron BF-900 model unit adopt protocol recommendation propose European Society Clinical Nutrition Metabolism : - Assess body mass height individual time examination ; - Individual fasting drink alcohol least 8 hour ; - Urinate exam ; - Do perform physical exercise eight hour test ; - No injury skin electrode ; - Clean skin alcohol ; - Position electrode always side body ; - Minimum 5 cm distance electrode ; - Separated stem arm 30 leg apart 45 ° ; - Environment neutral ( electric magnetic field ) ; - Notice shape body risk possible anomaly ( edema , amputation , atrophy , scoliosis , dystrophy ) ; - In case obesity , use electricity insulate material ( towel , example ) arm torso , thighs ; - When prostheses implant , measure opposite side ; - Do use metal object examination earring , bracelet , watch like . It indicate individual pacemaker pregnancy . Anthropometric measurement measure previously train evaluator . The height determine balance rule couple degree 1 mm , individual back , upright stand position , foot together , try put posterior surface heel , pelvic shoulder girdle contact instrument . Prior first session last session measure body weight , skin suprailiac abdominal fold , waist circumference , waist circumference , hip circumference waist-hip ratio calculation . Body weight measure traditional mechanical scale 100g graduation , front man , upright position , foot together , wear light clothes without shoe . Based two measurement do calculate Body Mass Index , kg ÷ height x height . The skinfold measure use estimate percentage body fat take use caliper . The supra-iliac abdominal fold measure . The suprailiac preaches measure , take anatomical reference iliac crest , oblique direction longitudinal axis body , ply middle region locate last rib iliac crest medial axillary line . Since abdominal crease measure take anatomical reference umbilicus , ply region locate 1 3 cm right scar parallel longitudinal axis body . The ratio waist hip index result equation divide circumference abdomen ( cm ) hip circumference ( cm ) . The measurement waist circumference measure individual standing upright expiratory phase respiration , use flexible measuring tape 1.5m , accurate one decimal place , ribbon position parallel floor , least measured iliac crest last rib . In Radio Frequency procedure use Dermosux RF equipment decrease localize fat abdomen flank . The parameter : maximum power 50 Watts frequency 1 MHz take place measurement skin temperature digital thermometer , keep always 40 - 42 ° C quadrant abdominal flank region . The handle use continuous repetitive movement light pressure . A glycerin oil film treatment area coupling mean use . The session hold 2 time week six consecutive week . The time session around 40 minute , 10 minute area median-right another 10 minute area median-left patient supine position . With patient lateral decubitus apply additional 10 minute right flank region 10 minute leave flank region . The schedule session mark accordance provision sample . It also direct first session importance voluntary change eat habit daily lifestyle habit physical activity , smoke alcohol .</detailed_description>
