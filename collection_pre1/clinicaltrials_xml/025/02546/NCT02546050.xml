	<detailed_description>An , 18 week , one-armed cross intervention trial consist 6-weeks pre-intervention period , 6-weeks intervention period 6-weeks post-intervention period . 25 healthy young men include trial . The pre-intervention period control period treatment . During intervention period participant receive 500 mg metformin daily 1st week , 500 mg twice daily 2nd week , 1000 mg + 500 mg daily 3rd week 1000 mg + 1000 mg daily remain three week . Post-interventional investigator examine gut microbiota participant 6 week completion intervention period . MESUREMENTS : Altered composition gut microbiota investigate 16S rRNA sequence primary outcome study . Secondary outcome investigate change metabolic inflammatory marker blood fecal sample . Blood , urine , saliva fecal sample store future study .</detailed_description>
