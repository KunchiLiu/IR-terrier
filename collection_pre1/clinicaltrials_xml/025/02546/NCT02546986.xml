	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study CC-486 With MK-3475 Treat Locally Advanced Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 2 , multicenter , international , randomize , placebo control , double-blind study assess safety efficacy CC-486 pembrolizumab combination therapy versus pembrolizumab plus placebo previously treat subject locally advance metastatic Non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) receive one prior platinum-based chemotherapy regimen . Approximately 90 subject randomize 1:1 receive CC-486 plus pembrolizumab placebo plus pembrolizumab follow : - Arm A : CC-486 300 mg administer orally daily day 1-14 plus pembrolizumab 200 mg administer 30-minute IV infusion day 1 21-day cycle - Arm B : Placebo administer orally daily day 1-14 plus pembrolizumab 200 mg administer 30-minute IV infusion day 1 21-day cycle Safety evaluate independent data monitoring committee ( DMC ) . A safety analysis perform first 10 subject arm last enrol subject complete 1 cycle treatment . Randomization stratify treatment arm : - Histology ( non-squamous versus squamous ) The decision discontinue subject , delay refuse Sponsor , remain responsibility treat physician . However , prior discontinue subject , Investigator may contact medical monitor forward appropriate support document review discussion . The study conduct compliance International Council Harmonisation ( ICH ) Technical Requirements Registration Pharmaceuticals Human Use/Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) applicable regulatory requirement . Primary analysis conduct 70 PFS event occur .</detailed_description>
