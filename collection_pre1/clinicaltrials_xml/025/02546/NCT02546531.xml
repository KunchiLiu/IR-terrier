	<brief_summary>In pancreatic cancer , target tumor microenvironment become promising therapeutic strategy . Focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) pathway activation essential promote fibrotic inflammatory tumor microenvironment , FAK inhibitor demonstrate reasonable anti-tumor activity preclinical setting . Furthermore , maximal synergetic effect achieve FAK inhibitor give combination PD-1 antagonist chemotherapy multiple pancreas tumor animal model . This support concept use FAK inhibitor reduce stromal fibrosis checkpoint immunotherapeutic treatment . Therefore , robust preclinical finding test proposed phase I trial .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Dose escalation cohort : Histologically cytologically confirm diagnosis advance solid tumor standard curative palliative measure exist longer effective . Expansion cohort : Histologically cytologically confirm diagnosis advance pancreatic cancer . Patients may stable frontline therapy ( define least 4 month stable disease nabpaclitaxel / gemcitabine ) may fail could tolerate least one line chemotherapy indicate advanced pancreatic cancer . There 24 week break last dose nabpaclitaxel/gemzar three drug regimen . No two line prior systemic therapy allow . Measurable disease define lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) ≥ 10 mm CT scan MRI , ≥ 20 mm chest xray , ≥ 10 mm caliper clinical exam . At least 18 year age . ECOG performance status ≤ 1 Life expectancy &gt; 3 month Normal bone marrow organ function define : Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcL Platelets ≥ 100,000/mcL Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x IULN AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 x IULN , ≤ 5.0 x IULN due liver involvement tumor Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x IULN glomerular filtration rate ≥ 60 mL/min INR ≤ 1.5 x IULN unless patient receive anticoagulant therapy long INR PTT within therapeutic range intend use anticoagulant aPTT ≤ 1.5 x IULN unless patient receive anticoagulant therapy long INR PTT within therapeutic range intend use anticoagulant Corrected QT interval ( QTc ) &lt; 480 m ( calculate Fridericia correction formula ) . Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control , abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , must inform treat physician immediately . Ability understand willingness sign IRB approve write informed consent document ( legally authorize representative , applicable ) . A history malignancy ≤ 2 year previous exception basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin treat local resection carcinoma situ cervix . No clinically evident ascites require therapeutic paracentesis . At risk bowel perforation Prior treatment drug FAK inhibitor class antiPD1 , antiPDL1 , antiPDL2 , antiCD137 , anticytotoxic Tlymphocyte associate antigen 4 ( CTLA4 ) antibody ( include ipilimumab antibody drug specifically target Tcell costimulation checkpoint pathway ) . Prior treatment systemic gemcitabine le 6 month Currently receive investigational agent Known brain metastasis . Patients know brain metastasis must exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . A history allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition defactinib , pembrolizumab , gemcitabine , agent use study . Received live vaccine within 30 day prior first study treatment . Has diagnosis immunodeficiency receive systemic steroid therapy form immunosuppressive therapy within 7 day prior first dose pembrolizumab . Has active autoimmune disease require systemic treatment within past 2 month document history clinically severe autoimmune disease , syndrome require systemic steroid immunosuppressive agent . Patients vitiligo resolve childhood asthma/atopy would exception rule . Patients require intermittent use bronchodilator local steroid injection would exclude study . Patients hypothyroidisms stable hormone replacement Sjorgen 's syndrome would e exclude study . Has history ( noninfectious ) pneumonitis require steroid current pneumonitis . Major surgery within 28 day prior first study treatment . History evidence cardiac risk include follow : history evidence current clinically significant uncontrolled arrhythmia arrhythmia require treatment exception atrial fibrillation paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia ; history acute coronary syndrome within 6 month prior first dose study therapy ( include myocardial infarction unstable angina , coronary angioplasty , stenting ) ; history congestive heart failure recent ejection fraction &lt; 45 % ( screen LVEF assessment without history CHF require ) . Known active hepatitis B ( e.g . HBsAg reactive ) hepatitis C ( e.g . HCV RNA [ qualitative ] detect ) Requires continue use warfarin anticoagulation stop warfarin safely switch another anticoagulant Gastrointestinal condition could interfere swallow absorption study medication . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , immunosuppression , autoimmune condition , underlie pulmonary disease , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant and/or breastfeeding . Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test within 14 day study entry . Known HIVpositivity combination antiretroviral therapy potential pharmacokinetic interaction pembrolizumab and/or defactinib . In addition , patient increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Appropriate study undertake patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate .</criteria>
