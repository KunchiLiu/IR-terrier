	<brief_summary>Secretory otitis medium ( SOM ) middle ear effusion common find affect child age 4-5 year . It usually associate 5-15 deci Bells hearing loss . Although spontaneous resolution normalisation hear usual outcome , take several month . Secretory otitis medium common cause hearing impairment paediatric age group . When hear loss cause SOM bilateral persists 3-6 month , surgery tympanostomy tube insertion general anaesthesia indicate . In Sweden , 10000 child undergo operation annually . Although many child unilateral bilateral SOM improve summer , problem usually recur autumn winter . The cost SOM Swedish society 600 million Swedish crown 2005 . In two previous study , investigator conclude nonsurgical treatment method , develop assist child SOM equalise middle ear pressure , could normalise hear level 80 % child SOM minimum duration 3 month . These child avoid therefore grommet insertion . The investigator would like assess effect new treatment method mainly hear threshold child SOM . The investigator expect use new method could help child SOM avoid operation grommet insertion .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : SOM middle ear effusion common cause hearing impairment child . Hearing loss occurs due accumulation fluid middle ear . In case , SOM follow acute otitis medium ( AOM ) . In case SOM bilateral persists 3-6 month , operation grommet insertion general anaesthesia indicate . 10000 child SOM operate grommet insertion every year Sweden . In case unilateral hearing loss cause SOM , grommet insertion rarely indicated duration symptom less one year . Some patient develop persistent perforation eardrum extrusion tympanostomy tube . A new method middle ear pressure equalisation develop Sahlgrenska University Hospital . 45 child age 2-8 year SOM persist 3 month treat new method wait period grommet insertion . 80 % child cure regain normal hearing avoid operation . No complication/side effect notice compliance good . Aim study : The study aim compare surgical treatment new non surgical treatment SOM . The effect treatment method hear level health economics assess . Hypothesis : Can hear improvement achieve new non surgical treatment method child persistent SOM . Material Method : 80 child age 2,5-7 year 3-6 month duration bilateral SOM associate hearing loss type B C2 tympanogram offer inclusion study . All patient undergo first visit microscopic examination ear , audiogram tympanogram . The child randomise thereafter two group . The first group treat new method one month . While group operate grommet insertion general anesthesia . If waiting time operation exceed four week , child undergo new audiogram tympanogram result still abnormal , operation perform . The second group act control . Both group undergo one month complete treatment new examination microscopic examination ear , audiogram group tympanogram group one , due fact tympanogram result conclusive presence grommet ear drum . Intervention : The first group verify middle ear effusion treat new nonsurgical method middle ear pressure equalisation . A face mask connect tube colour balloon attach . The tube also connect balloon . A safety valve use prevent high air pressure . A balloon hidden green soft toy form frog . The parent child hold face mask mouth child blow balloon . On need , mainly begin treatment course , parent press frog 's abdomen order fill balloon air . During first week , low pressure balloon use , change high pressure balloon one week . Full compliance treatment define 20 blow ( 5 minute ) morning even one week . Expected result importance : The investigator expect study show new treatment method SOM , effectively improve hearing affected child . This great significance medical , social economic point view . Hearing impairment paediatric age group great negative impact speech development disadvantageous child parent also whole society .</detailed_description>
