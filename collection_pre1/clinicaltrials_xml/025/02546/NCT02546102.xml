	<brief_summary>ICT-107 consist dendritic cell , prepare autologous mononuclear cell pulse six synthetic peptide derive tumor associate antigen ( TAA ) present glioblastoma tumor cell . This Phase 3 study evaluate ICT-107 patient newly diagnose glioblastoma . Subjects randomize receive standard care chemoradiation ( temozolomide ( TMZ ) either ICT-107 blind control . Reinfusion pulse dendritic cell stimulate cytotoxic T cell specifically target glioblastoma tumour cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 3 Randomized , Double-blind , Controlled Study ICT-107 Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This double blind Phase III study eligible subject randomize two treatment arm follow SOC primary treatment chemoradiation : Arm 1 receive ICT-107 combination standard care , temozolomide ( TMZ ) , Arm 2 receive TMZ blind control . A 1:1 randomization employ , ARM 1 receive ICT-107 Arm 2 receive placebo control . All subject must HLA-A2+ . All subject must glioblastoma tissue tumor assessment MGMT methylation status prior randomization ( stratification ) . Subjects tumor resection magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) prior enrollment study . After sign write informed consent require privacy compliance form screen , enrolled subject undergo large volume apheresis study site collection PBMCs . Apheresis product send manufacturing site active therapy ( ICT-107 ) control prepared subject prior randomization The study period consist 4 time period ; 6-week Post-Surgery Standard Care Treatment Phase subject receive radiotherapy TMZ ; TMZ radiation initiate 8 week surgical resection glioblastoma ; Rest Period 14 day subject reassessed eligibility , randomize ; 4 week Induction Phase study therapy ( ICT-107 Control ) give weekly ; follow Maintenance Phase study therapy give monthly 11 month , every 6 month either progression , withdrawal study , death , supply autologous study therapy exhaust . Randomized subject receive 4 weekly administration subject-specific study therapy ( ICT-107 Control ) Induction Phase . No TMZ give 4 week Induction Phase . Each study therapy injection deliver intradermally ( axilla ) . The Maintenance Phase consist administration subject-specific study therapy monthly 11 month Induction Phase ( total 15 injection 12 month Induction Maintenance Phases ) , every 6 mo . thereafter depletion confirmation progressive disease ( PD ) . During Maintenance Phase ( ICT-107 control give monthly ) , administration TMZ subject specific study therapy control separate time approximately 2 week ( see Section 9.1.4 ) . Pre-treatment , treatment assessment schedule subject .</detailed_description>
