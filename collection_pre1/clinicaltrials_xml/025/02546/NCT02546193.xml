	<brief_summary>Induction labor , cause labor start otherwise start spontaneously , sometimes necessary pregnancy progress ensure safety mother infant . Labor induction often begin cervical ripening , various method use prepare cervix contraction labor . Cervical ripen beneficial decrease need cesarean section ; however , lengthy process . By tradition , pregnant woman admit hospital start process remain inpatient baby bear . There increase interest allow mother return home first part process . She may satisfy comfortable environment family . Growing scientific evidence support use Foley catheter approach outpatient cervical ripening . The Foley catheter safe , effective method already use often inpatient set . It cause increased health risk either mother baby . Previous research study show safe effective woman return home Foley catheter woman spend less time hospital delivery . More information need becomes standard care . This research study allow pregnant woman return home first night labor induction Foley catheter place . In morning return hospital stay delivery . They compare group woman remain hospital entire labor induction . The benefit go home labor induction may include increase maternal satisfaction optimize use resource hospital .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Outpatient Foley Catheter Compared Usual Inpatient Care Labor Induction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize controlled trial . The intervention group comprise low risk pregnant woman Foley catheter place follow dismissal home return morning continuation labor induction process . The control group consist woman remain inpatient entire cervical ripening phase follow continuation labor induction process inpatient set . Low risk pregnant woman term enrol clinic provider recommend induction labor specific indication . They educate induction labor , Foley catheter , propose research study . If would like participate , consent clinic . Computer-generated randomization occur morning plan induction , patient contact phone inform assign group . The randomization stratify parity BMI . Outpatient Foley catheter group : If patient randomize intervention group ( outpatient Foley ) , undergo following . She present Family Birth Center evening 1900 . She undergo nonstress test ( NST ) , ultrasound fetal presentation amniotic fluid index , cervical exam calculation Bishop score . The patient ask regular , painful contraction , decrease fetal movement , vaginal bleeding , leakage fluid vagina concern rupture membrane , fever chill . A Foley catheter place follow criterion meet : nonstress test reactive reassuring ( without presence ≥ 3 variable deceleration 20 minute period , late-appearing deceleration , deceleration last ≥1 minute ) , fetal presentation cephalic , amniotic fluid index 5 centimeter , Bishop score &lt; 6 , cervical dilation &lt; 3 cm , clinical characteristic exclude trial describe inclusion/exclusion criterion . A 30 French Foley place either digitally speculum assistance . It inflate 60 cc normal saline tap patient 's inner thigh . The fetal heart rate tracing monitor 1 hour Foley placement . The patient send home follow criterion meet : fetal heart rate trace reactive category I ; evidence rupture membrane , spontaneous labor , vaginal bleeding spotting ; exclusion criterion present . Before discharge , patient may receive pharmacologic pain relief form one dose acetaminophen and/or fentanyl . The patient instruct return Family Birth Center 0700 follow day . She give detailed verbal write instruction contact return Family Birth Center morning . She provide 24 hour direct access line Family Birth Center call question concern . If Foley catheter expulsed home , record time expulsion . She need return Family Birth Center earlier plan due expulsion . When patient return morning , induction continue discretion provide obstetric team . The remainder care first , second , third stage labor discretion provide team . The patient continuous fetal monitoring . All patient ' labor progress monitor use partogram . Cesarean delivery perform arrest labor fail induction unless criterion meet outline Family Birth Center Workgroup protocol make effective 6/2/14 . Inpatient usual care group : If patient randomize control group ( inpatient usual care ) , arrive Family Birth Center 1900 undergo induction labor . She undergo nonstress test ( NST ) , ultrasound fetal presentation amniotic fluid index , cervical exam calculation Bishop score . The patient ask regular , painful contraction , decrease fetal movement , vaginal bleeding , leakage fluid vagina concern rupture membrane , fever chill . She include exclude study base information . Induction labor may proceed discretion provide obstetric team . Cervical ripening perform either 25 mcg vaginal misoprostol every 4 hour maximum six dose 30 Fr Foley catheter fill 60 cc normal saline . The patient may need method inpatient stay cervix unfavorable . A Foley catheter favor cervical ripening phase tachysystole and/or nonreassuring fetal heart trace preclude misoprostol administration , provide Bishop score still &lt; 6 . The remainder care first , second , third stage labor discretion provide team . All patient ' labor progress monitor use partogram . Cesarean delivery perform arrest labor fail induction unless criterion meet outline Family Birth Center Workgroup protocol make effective 6/2/14 . Follow Each mother ask complete survey leave hospital describe experience satisfaction cervical ripening process . Primary secondary endpoint collect neonatal maternal chart 42 day patient 's delivery date patient 's final postpartum clinic visit , whichever come last .</detailed_description>
