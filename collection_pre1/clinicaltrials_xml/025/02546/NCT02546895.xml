For several decade , many study treatment modality ( surgery , chemotherapy , radiation therapy ) , complication side effect head neck cancer West . Many institution try improve survival rate resolve toxicity chemotherapy radiation treatment head neck cancer patient . However little information characteristic head neck cancer , effectiveness treatment ( survival rate , recurrence , complication rate ) , prognosis , particularly Korean well Asian patient . Therefore necessary evaluate analyze feature head neck cancer etiology , pathogenesis , risk factor , prognostic factor , treatment outcome site specific cohort ( South Korea ) separately . It could helpful improve treatment outcome head neck cancer overall , design race site specific treatment head neck cancer , develop management strategy common Asia well West . The purpose study 1 . To establish prospective tumor registry patient 's information , treatment-related morbidity , treatment outcome quality life , addition prospective collection patient sample ( blood tumor tissue ) . 2 . To establish predictive model treatment outcomes treatment-related morbidity . 3 . To develop biomarkers predictive and/or prognostic factor .</brief_summary>
