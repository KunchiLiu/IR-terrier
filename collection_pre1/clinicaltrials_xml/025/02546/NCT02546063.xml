	<detailed_description>Background For individual type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) current gold standard evaluate carbohydrate ( CHO ) amount meal carefully weigh different component calculate CHO content use reference nutritional table . The result CHO amount use define insulin dose need avoid abnormal postprandial glucose profile . Since cumbersome procedure real life , diabetic individual often estimate CHO amount base personal experience . Especially food serve plate CHO estimate often significantly underestimated lead high variation postprandial blood glucose . Besides immediate risk hypoglycaemia , emerge evidence suboptimal control postprandial glucose affiliate increase risk long-term complication ( e.g . diabetic micro- macro-vascular disease ) . The effect CHO count T1D control increasingly recognize investigate . A meta-analysis include five study individual T1D show , improve CHO count accuracy reduces HbA1c significantly ( 0.64 % reduction HbA1c compare control group ) . Teaching adult individual T1D count CHO reduce HbA1c significantly also lead improvement quality life . Similar finding report child , high CHO count accuracy associate low HbA1c . Even short educational intervention 4 week still result significant sustained effect HbA1c reduction 9 month without increase hypoglycaemia . Lower CHO count accuracy significant predictor prolong time hyperglycaemic state . In one study adult 31 % participant estimate CHO content error le 20 gram per day accurate CHO estimation correlate low HbA1c value . In line finding another study show individual intensive insulin therapy count CHO content meal average error order 16 gram 21 % . In general overestimation small meal substantial underestimation large meal . While breakfast ( +8.5 % ) snack ( -5 % ) estimate fairly accurately , lunch ( -28 % ) dinner ( -23 % ) prone error lead underestimation order 30 gram . In child , inaccuracy ±10grams deteriorate postprandial glycaemic control , whereas ±20 gram variation significantly impact postprandial glycaemia . The debate optimally estimate CHO intake on-going controversial . Fact even well train diabetic individual find difficult estimate CHO precisely especially meal serve plate prone false estimation underline emergent need novel approach CHO estimation . The investigator hypothesize computer vision support CHO estimation beneficial impact postprandial glucose control , ultimately lead reduce episode hypoglycaemia reduction long term complication . The recent advance smartphone technology computer vision permit development application automatic dietary assessment meal image analysis . The application use either number image short video upcoming meal , capture user 's smartphone . Although several system propose past decade , none design individual diabetes , rely strong assumption , often hold real life , require much user input . The GoCARB system provide CHO estimation individual T1D , use two meal image . The current version GoCARB design deal - elliptical plate flat base ; - single-dish image ; - fully visible food item . The system work without assumption food shape , support follow food class : Pasta , green salad , meat , bread food , bean , carrot , mash potato , rice , potato , bread , cheese , egg , couscous , mushrooms spätzli . Objective The purpose study investigate effect GoCARB-supported CHO estimation postprandial glucose control individual T1D sensor augment insulin pump therapy . In typical scenario , user place credit card-sized reference object next meal acquire two image use her/his smartphone . A graphical user interface guide user choose optimal angle image acquisition base smartphone 's built-in sensor . The image transmit dedicated server via Wi-Fi mobile network . Then , follow computer vision algorithm activate : plate detect different food item plate automatically segment recognize , 3D shape reconstruct . On basis shape , segmentation result reference card , volume CHO content item calculate combine food type volume . Finally , result display user . Methods This study 's overall objective perform prospective randomize controlled clinical pilot study compare postprandial glucose control assist GoCARB system usual care approach participant . Scope study investigate whether postprandial glucose profile improve use GoCARB prototype CHO estimation . Postprandial glycaemia evaluate use continuous glucose monitoring .</detailed_description>
