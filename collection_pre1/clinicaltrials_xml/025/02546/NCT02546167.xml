	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria 1 . Subjects must confirm prior diagnosis active MM define updated IMWG criteria101.. 2 . Subjects must relapse refractory disease either one following : 1 . At least 3 prior regimen , must contain alkylating agent , proteasome inhibitor , immunomodulatory agent ( IMiD ) . OR 2 . At least 2 prior regimen `` doublerefractory '' proteasome inhibitor IMiD , define progression within 60 day treatment agent . Note : Induction therapy , stem cell transplant , maintenance therapy , give sequentially without intervene progression , consider 1 `` regimen '' . 3 . Subjects must sign write , informed consent . 4 . Subjects must ≥ 18 year age . 5 . Subjects must least 90 day since autologous allogeneic stem cell transplant , perform . 6 . Subjects must adequate vital organ function : 1 . Serum creatinine ≤ 2.5 estimate creatinine clearance ≥30 ml/min dialysisdependent . 2 . Absolute neutrophil count ≥1000/μl platelet count ≥50,000/μl ( ≥30,000/μl bone marrow plasma cell ≥50 % cellularity ) . 3 . SGOT ≤ 3x upper limit normal total bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/dl ( except patient hyperbilirubinemia attribute Gilbert 's syndrome ) . 4 . Left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) ≥ 45 % . LVEF assessment must perform within 8 week enrollment . 5 . Toxicities prior therapy , exception peripheral neuropathy attributable bortezomib , must recover grade ≤ 2 accord CTC 4.0 criterion subject 's prior baseline . 7 . Subjects must ECOG performance status 02 . 8 . Subjects must measurable disease study entry , must include least 1 follow : 1 . Serum Mspike ≥ 0.5 g/dL* 2 . 24 hr urine Mspike ≥ 200mg 3 . Involved serum FLC ≥ 50 mg/L abnormal ratio 4 . Measurable plasmacytoma exam image 5 . Bone marrow plasma cell ≥ 20 % ( bone marrow biopsy require screen measurable disease present ) . Note : Patients IgA myeloma serum protein electrophoresis deem unreliable , due comigration normal serum protein paraprotein beta region , may consider eligible long total serum IgA level elevate normal range . 9 . Subjects reproductive potential must agree use acceptable birth control method . IMWG Criteria Diagnosis Multiple Myeloma Presence Mcomponent serum and/or urine plus clonal plasma cell bone marrow and/or document clonal plasmacytoma . In patient detectable Mcomponent , abnormal serum FLC ratio serum FLC assay substitute satisfy criterion . For patient , serum urine Mcomponent normal serum FLC ratio , baseline bone marrow must ≥10 % clonal plasma cell ; patient refer 'nonsecretory myeloma ' . Patients biopsyproven amyloidosis and/or systemic light chain deposition disease ( LCDD ) classify 'myeloma documented amyloidosis ' 'myeloma document LCDD , ' respectively ≥30 % plasma cell and/or myelomarelated bone disease . PLUS one following , must attributable underlying plasma cell disorder : Calcium elevation ( &gt; 11.5 mg/dl ) Renal insufficiency ( creatinine &gt; 2 mg/dl ) Anemia ( hemoglobin &lt; 10 g/dl 2 g/dl normal ) Bone disease ( lytic lesion osteopenia ) OR one follow `` myelomadefining event '' Bone marrow plasma cell ≥60 % cellularity Serum free kappa : lambda ratio ≥100:1 ( ≤1:100 ) , involved free light chain ≥100 mg/L More 1 focal bone lesion MRI Exclusion Criteria Be pregnant lactating . Have inadequate venous access contraindication leukapheresis . Have active uncontrolled infection . Have active hepatitis B , hepatitis C , HIV infection . Any uncontrolled medical psychiatric disorder would preclude participation outline . Have NYHA Class III IV heart failure , unstable angina , history recent ( within 6 month ) myocardial infarction sustain ( &gt; 30 second ) ventricular tachyarrhythmias . Have receive prior gene therapy genemodified cellular immunotherapy . Subject may receive , however , nongenemodified autologous Tcells association antimyeloma vaccine ( e.g. , hTERT MAGEA3 ) vaccination infectious agent ( e.g. , influenza pneumococcus ) perform previous study . Have active autoimmune disease , include connective tissue disease , uveitis , sarcoidosis , inflammatory bowel disease , multiple sclerosis , history severe ( judged principal investigator ) autoimmune disease require prolonged immunosuppressive therapy . Have history neurodegenerative central nervous system movement disorder . Have prior active central nervous system ( CNS ) involvement ( e.g . leptomeningeal disease , parenchymal mass ) myeloma . Screening ( e.g . lumbar puncture ) require unless suspicious symptom radiographic finding present . Subjects calvarial disease extend intracranially involve dura exclude , even CSF negative myeloma . Have active acute chronic graftversushostdisease ( GVHD ) , require immunosuppressant medication GVHD , within 4 week enrollment .</criteria>
