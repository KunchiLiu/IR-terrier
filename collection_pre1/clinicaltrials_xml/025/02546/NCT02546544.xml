	<brief_summary>This international , multi-centre , single arm Bayesian design phase 2 study identify determine safety activity anti-IGF-1/IR inhibition patient relapse and/or refractory ESFT . Approximately 40 patient recruit 5-7 European centre . Each patient treat single agent linsitinib , 600 mg orally day day 1-3 , 8-10 15-17 21 day cycle disease progression undue toxicity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>An important development ES identification IGF-1R pathway dependency . The reason remarkable single agent efficacy observe small subset patient remain unknown , relative lack efficacy majority patient . There may heterogeneity response due partial signal pathway inhibition tumour level , inherent resistance ES cell presence alternative pathway activation IR-A receptor signalling . Here aim establish pharmacodynamic response ES tumour use functional image 18FDG-PET-CT repeat post treatment biopsy biomarker response , toxicity clinical outcome dual anti-IGF-1R/IR kinase block single agent linsitinib . This single arm phase 2 study utilise adaptive Bayesian analysis . Approximately 40 patient recruit national bone sarcoma centre 5 EU country 18 month . Eligible patient take 4x 150 mg tablet day , day 1-3 week follow 4 day - repeat 3 week = one treatment cycle . Patients remain treatment long gain clinical benefit . The primary objective determine effect linsitinib patient 's tumour term change biomarker PET scan establish safety trial drug ( linsitinib ) Ewing sarcoma dose treatment schedule use trial .</detailed_description>
