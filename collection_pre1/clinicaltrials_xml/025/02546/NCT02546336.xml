	<brief_title>Ultrasound-Guided Hip Joint Cooled Radiofrequency Denervation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Radiological prevalence HOA high . Hip denervation ( HD ) know palliative procedure initially perform open surgery . The role obturator , femoral sciatic nerve hip joint innervation discover . Several small clinical anatomical study address feasibility benefit radiofrequency hip denervation ( RFHD ) . Ultrasound guidance may eliminate equivocality previously publish technique provide precise image guidance logical anatomically sound approach procedural target include soft tissue , nerve , tendon joint capsule . None structure localize routine fluoroscopy . Ultrasound bedside image tool accept safe reliable . In two meta-analyses , use real-time two-dimensional ultrasound placement CVCs substantially decrease mechanical complication reduce number attempt require cannulation fail attempt cannulation compare standard landmark placement . Pertinent propose study , recent systematic review meta-analysis accuracy US-guided versus landmark-guided hip joint injection reveal US-guided injection significantly accurate landmark-guided . The significance study lie potential improve functional activity pain control patient HOA . Also , may eventually lead decrease patient resort Total Hip Arthroplasty ( THA ) ultimate end solution HOA .</detailed_description>
