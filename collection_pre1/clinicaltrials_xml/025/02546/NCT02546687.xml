	<detailed_description>Prediction Anastomotic Leak/Stricture Esophagectomy Gastric Pull-up Venous Blood Gas . Esophageal resection become routine surgical procedure many medical center . Usually reconstruction esophagectomy achieve gastric pull-up cervical intrathoracic anastomosis . The blood supply gastric tube right gastroepiploic arcade . Bad borderline perfusion gastric tube main reason future anastomotic leak stricture . There lot method intraoperative assessment gastric tube perfusion . This method include basic ( color , temperature tube ) advance assessment optical fiber spectroscopy , visible light spectroscopy , combination laser Doppler flowmeter spectrophotometer , laser Doppler imager , partial tissue oxygen pressure Clark-type polar graphic oxygen electrode , continuous measurement mucosal PCO2 use recirculation gas analysis TONOCAP device together mean arterial pressure measurement , cardiac output systemic vascular resistance pulse contour analysis laser-assisted fluorescent-dye angiography ( 1-5 ) . All method comparative complicate promise good assessment result . The investigator suggest measure component venous blood gas ( O2 , pH , CO2 , lactate ) area future anastomosis construction gastric tube creation anastomosis ( 15-30 minute ) , compare result analysis systemic venous blood . The investigator suppose elevation acid feature blood ( pH decreasing , lactate increase etc . ) expression tissue ischemia gastric tube creation maybe significant predictive sign future anastomotic leak stricture . After operation investigator plan find relationship blood gas change rate anastomotic leak stricture . Objectives The aim study compare change venous blood gas gastric tube together systemic venous blood construction gastric tube creation anastomosis . After operation investigator plan find relationship blood gas change rate anastomotic leak stricture . Study Design This prospective study . Anticipated cohort 50 patient The investigator plan take 1-2 cc venous blood proximal part stomach gastric tube creation time investigator take amount venous blood peripheral vein . This blood analyze `` ABL800 FLEX blood gas analyzer '' ( Radiometer Copenhagen ) routine blood analysis make anesthesiologist operation . This blood sample investigator make 15-30 minute area proximal stomach ( creation gastric tube ) peripheral vein anastomosis creation . Important technical need ( regardless study ) stomach area investigator go get blood analysis remove immediately anastomosis creation . So danger future injury tissue change patient due needle stub blood analysis . Every patient undergo routine follow surgical department minimum 7-10 hospitalization day describe sign anastomotic leak . Patients continue routine follow outpatient clinic ( every patient kind surgery ) two week , 6 week 3 month discharge surgical department evaluation anastomotic stricture sign . Participants . Inclusion criteria Patients schedule undergo elective esophagectomy gastric pull-up reconstruction Beilinson hospital willing able give inform consent . Data collection statistical analysis . Data collect patient demographic data , comorbidities , kind pathology , neoadjuvant treatment ( cancer patient ) , time surgery , patient hemodynamic state surgery . The investigator collect blood result especially measure O2 , pH , CO2 , lactate . After surgery investigator describe collect clinical radiological sign anastomotic leak stricture . Statistical analysis . Logistic regression ROC ( receiver operating characteristic ) use ass relationship blood gas change rate anastomotic leak stricture .</detailed_description>
