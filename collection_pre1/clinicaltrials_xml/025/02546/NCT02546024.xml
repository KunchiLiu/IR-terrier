	<detailed_description>Aim objective : Predictors treatment response may help improve treatment approach late-onset major depression patient . The study identify feature patient major depression may predict good poor treatment response . It use demographic , clinical , neuropsychological brain MRI data investigate potential value predictor response standard treatment 12 week . For example , impairment executive function cognitive testing may predict patient whose depression respond 12 week treatment . MRI may reveal specific characteristic predict good response treatment . Methodology Subject inclusion exclusion criterion Inclusion : Patients major depressive disorder , diagnose first time age 60 year , Mini Mental State Examination score &gt; 24/30 . Exclusion : Participants history major psychiatric illness intellectual disability exclude . Those unstable medical condition , include history neurological disease ( stroke , epilepsy , recent delirium , neurodegenerative disease dementia ) also exclude . Recruitment : Patients late-onset major depressive disorder identify member care teams Mental Health Older Adults Services South London Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust . A poster information leaflet study also provide service facilitate recruitment . The researcher also use trust Consent Contact ( c4c ) ' mechanism assist recruitment process . Potential participant contact researcher give permission contact sent write brief information sheet invite respond via expression interest letter stamp address envelope . If interested , consent screen medical record review seek . And follow screen absence significant cognitive impairment Mini-Mental State Examination researcher already perform , provide full information sheet invite consent participate study home IOPPN depend participant ' preference . Screening assessment The initial screening assessment do potential participant ' residence . A brief history psychiatric medical condition take . Participants interview follow assessment : - Mini-Mental State Examination ( MMSE ) 30 point assessment general cognitive function , exemption complete clinical work within 1 month assessment . - MRI safety questionnaire If potential participant eligible inclusion study remain interested , write information leave appointment make discussion gain informed consent . If eligible study basis screening , decide proceed stage , data collect destroyed . Consent visit baseline assessment : Subjects encourage read information sheet carefully opportunity ask question stage . Their capacity consent assess researcher ask provide verbal write consent involve study . The following baseline assessment neuropsychological test perform participant ' home IOPPN depend participant ' preference last one half hour : 1 . Demographic data include sex , age , marital living status , number education year complete , occupation . 2 . Clinical data include current prescribed medical treatment , current depressive episode onset treatment type , dosage duration receive . 3 . Cumulative Illness Rating Scale Geriatrics ( CIR-G ) score questionnaire assess underlying medical disease . 4 . Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale ( HADS ) , self-rating scale Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HAM-D 21 item ) , interview-based rating scale use depressive severity assessment . 5 . WHODAS 2.0 questionnaire assess general functioning disability . 6 . Neuropsychological test - Trail make test - pen paper base test process speed . - Digit span Spatial Span test - test work memory . - Verbal fluency , category fluency design fluency - test fluency ask participant generate word picture rule give . - Colour-Word Interference test - paper-based reading test inhibition . A letter send participant ' GPs inform participation . The GP may ask confirm provide information case participant questionable medical history might contraindicate MRI procedure . MRI scan procedure : Participants undergo MRI scan CNS base IOPPN within 4 week baseline assessment . A taxi provide participant travel IOPPN . At CNS , participant encourage ask question MRI safety questionnaire repeat ensure contraindication . Noise protection provide participant mock scan offer familiarize real MRI scanner would like . Participants undergo structural functional MRI scan , latter include ask close eye period time . The MRI scan last 1 hour . After MRI scan , transport taxi provide return participant home . Final assessment At Week 11 , researcher contact participant make appointment final assessment Week 12 home IOPPN depend participant ' preference . The final assessment last one hour . Participants undergo assessment baseline assessment Mini-Mental State Examination . Note throughout follow study , participant receive standard care , follow Trust Care Pathway .</detailed_description>
