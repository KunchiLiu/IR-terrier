	<brief_summary>This first human study new therapeutic antibody MOv18 IgE patient advance cancer seek demonstrate potential use IgE antibody example use IgE class antibody treatment cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Study MOv18 IgE , First Class Chimeric IgE Antibody Patients With Advanced Solid Tumours</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Therapeutic antibody significantly improve prognosis patient range cancer . Currently available therapeutic antibody belong IgG class . This study look new drug call MOv18 belongs different class antibody , IgE class . IgE antibody may trigger powerful immune response tumour cell available IgG antibody effective treat certain type cancer . This first time IgE antibody therapy give patient cancer . MOv18 IgE antibody design recognise attach particular protein call folate receptor alpha . Scientists find protein surface certain cancer cell surface normal cell , commonly ovarian cancer lesser extent cancer kidney , pleura , endometrium , lung , breast , bladder , colon pancreas . Once attach , MOv18 IgE antibody trigger body 's immune system attack kill cancer cell . Patients select base presence folate receptor protein tumour previous biopsy . The study first study new antibody treatment give human focus primarily assessment safety confirm finding preclinical study exposure MOv18 IgE trigger anaphylaxis . This addition extensive PK , biodistribution antibody immunological response . The study follow dose escalation design small group patient treat set dose , start low dose follow exponential increasing dos , find safe dose drug good chance effectively treat cancer . Patients receive short course treatment . The majority patient treat high dose level ask provide pre post treatment biopsy explore effect treatment tumour .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Histologically cytologicallyproven advance , unresectable solid tumour type know express FRα percentage case 2 . Archival tumour tissue express FRα ( 1+ , 2+ 3+ membrane stain least 5 % tumour cell immunohistochemistry use BN3.2 antibody , base technique describe Lawson &amp; Scorer , 2010 ) . For patient undergo pretreatment tumour biopsy , FRα expression pretreatment sample take precedence result previous archival specimen . 3 . Advanced disease alternative therapy felt appropriate . 4 . Measurable disease disease evaluable tumour marker . Measurable disease prefer patient enter high cohort facilitate efficacy assessment . 5 . World Health Organisation ( WHO ) performance status 0 1 life expectancy least 12 week . 6 . Haematological biochemical index within range show . These measurement perform within 7 day first dose MOv18 IgE ( Day 7 Predose Day 1 ) . Measurements perform Day 7 may accept CDD demonstrate eligibility repeat test logistically difficult patient consider necessary medically opinion Investigator CDD . Laboratory Test Value require Haemoglobin ( Hb ) ≥ 9.0 g/dL Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 x 10^9/L Platelet count ≥ 100 x 10^9/L Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ≤ 2.5 x ULN unless raise due liver metastases case 5 x ULN permissible Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN 7 . Aged 16 year time consent give . 8 . Written ( sign date ) inform consent capable cooperate treatment followup . 1 . Radiotherapy ( except palliative reason ) , endocrine therapy , immunotherapy chemotherapy previous four week ( six week nitrosoureas mitomycinC ) investigational medicinal product previous 4 week , 5 product halflives treatment . 2 . Patients betablockers unable interrupt betablockade ( may counteract therapeutic effect adrenaline ) , tricyclic antidepressants/MAOIs ( dangerously augment effect adrenaline ) . These agent discontinue least 4 halflives administration first dose MOv18 IgE duration MOv18 IgE therapy . 3 . Patients bisphosphonates treat bisphosphonates last 18 month . 4 . Ongoing toxic manifestation previous treatment resolve Grade 1 low ( alopecia grade Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy ) . 5 . Known brain metastasis previously treat stable least 2 month . 6 . Female patient able become pregnant ( already pregnant lactate ) . However , female patient negative serum urine pregnancy test enrolment agree use two highly effective form contraception ( oral , injected implant hormonal contraception condom ; intrauterine device condom ; diaphragm spermicidal gel condom ) effective first administration IMP , throughout study six month afterwards consider eligible . 7 . Male patient partner childbearing potential ( unless agree take measure father child use one form highly effective contraception first administration IMP , throughout study six month afterwards ) . Men pregnant lactate partner advise use barrier method contraception ( example , condom plus spermicidal gel ) prevent exposure foetus neonate . 8 . Major thoracic abdominal surgery patient yet recover . 9 . At high risk effect anaphylaxis nonmalignant systemic disease include active uncontrolled infection , cardiac failure , peripheral vascular disease , previous cerebrovascular accident ( CVA ) , dyspnoea due heart failure , extensive lung metastasis , significant pleural effusion condition . 10 . History laryngeal oedema , uncontrolled high risk asthma ( accord Global Initiative Asthma ( GINA ) guideline ) , anaphylaxis . 11 . Patients congenital acquire immunodeficiency syndrome receive immunosuppressive therapy ( include dose systemic corticosteroid ) , immunosuppressed post organ transplant . However , patient receive inhaled corticosteroid patient history allergy ( anaphylaxis ) eligible , patient history autoimmune disease . 12 . Known serologically positive hepatitis B , hepatitis C human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) . 13 . Patients baseline elevation βtryptase ( indicate possible mastocytosis ) . 14 . Participating plan participate another interventional clinical trial , whilst take part study . Participation observational study followup phase previous interventional trial acceptable . 15 . Any condition Investigator 's opinion would make patient good candidate clinical study .</criteria>
