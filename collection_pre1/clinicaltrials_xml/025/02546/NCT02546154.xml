	<brief_title>Time Relapse Iron Deficiency Anaemia After Standard Treatment With The Intravenous Iron ( Monofer® )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intravenous ( IV ) iron well-tolerated efficacious treatment iron deficiency anaemia condition Chronic Kidney Disease ( CKD ) Inflammatory Bowel Disease ( IBD ) . Several study CKD IBD patient show IV iron superior oral iron , likely explain decreased uptake poor compliance ( due gastrointestinal side-effects ) use oral iron . The patented Iron Isomaltoside 1000 ( Monofer® ) develop overcome current limitation IV iron drug regard safety convenience use . The possibility administer Monofer® high single dos ( 20 mg/kg ) reduce number treatment visit need full iron correction , cost-effective , resource time-sparing , reduce drug exposure frequency decrease risk side-effects infusion reaction . The objective study monitor quality assure efficacy , include effect quality life , safety Monofer® CKD IBD patient population Monofer® use accord Monofer® label ( Summary Product Characteristics , SPC ) current clinical practice standard routine follow . The scientific rationale fulfill need systematic information/auditing applied practice include short long-term experience use IV iron different hospital setting current clinical practice . The outcome provide evidence base optimise treatment procedure term safety efficacy . The total duration study per site approximately 21 month , include 6 month enrollment period , prospective observation period least 12 month , period maximum 3 month prior last blood test . Patients attend hospital visit plan part standard treatment receive treatment part standard care accord doctor 's discretion . The number patient visit depend number Monofer® treatment course need study period . Each patient receive one treatment course 12 month inform consent . The last blood test take last Monofer® treatment course might occur 13-15 month inform consent . Study termination occur 12 month observational period complete patient last blood test collect last Monofer® treat patient study . Each treatment course consist one Monofer® administration . For administration Monofer® either intravenous infusion injection use . Pre- post-treatment blood test accord standard treatment quality life assessment fatigue symptom ( FACIT-Fatigue IBD-F Scales ) part Monofer® treatment course . Laboratory assessment , i.e . anaemia work-up/treatment evaluation , shall part local standard practice . The protocol accept additional sample outside current local standard practice take . Clinical data management perform accordance applicable standard data cleaning procedure . The collect data systematically enter electronic case report form ( eClinicalOS , myEDC , license BioStata Aps Denmark ) . The source information relevant treatment laboratory result obtain patient record well quality life questionnaire fatigue symptom . The data evaluate Pharmacosmos Medical Affairs team external Data Management vendor locate country within European Union .</detailed_description>
