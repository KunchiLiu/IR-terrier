	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate molecular biology tumor relation treatment response chemotherapy , particular paclitaxel compare combination paclitaxel carboplatin . The study carry two different , separate cohort : Cohort I : Patients large primary breast cancer ( &gt; 2.0 cm ) include locally advanced disease , treat weekly paclitaxel 12 week , continue anthracycline contain regimen another 12 week surgery . Patient randomize 1:1 receive carboplatin addition paclitaxel first 12 week treatment . Cohort II : Patients metastatic disease , available biopsy therapy include receive paclitaxel 24 week . Patients randomize 1:1 receive paclitaxel alone paclitaxel combination carboplatin .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>High-throughput method molecular biology reveal considerable alteration breast cancer genome , transcriptome proteome extensive heterogeneity tumor , potentially explain large variation response treatment . Classification breast cancer base molecular alteration , show clinical relevance . Studies genome-wide mRNA ( messenger ribonucleic acid ) /miRNA ( microRNA ) expression , copy number alteration ( CNAs ) DNA methylation , addition detection circulate tumor DNA could use improve prognostication aid therapy decision highly need . This project include phase II clinical trial patient randomize treatment standard anthracycline- taxane contain chemotherapy without addition carboplatin . The study aim include patient two cohort describe , large primary breast cancer ( cohort I - 150 patient ) patient metastatic disease ( cohort II - 60 patient ) . Essential study mandatory tissue sample comprehensive molecular analysis identify marker response .</detailed_description>
