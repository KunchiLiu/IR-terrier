	<brief_summary>This study intend inactive , middle-aged adult untreated pre-hypertension live Urbana-Champaign area , interested comprehensive program design enhance physical activity &amp; reduce blood pressure . All participant ask engage program develop accordance American Heart Association 's recommendation . Specifically , program encourage support lifestyle behavior change quit smoking , eat heart-healthy food , reduce excessive alcohol , addition weekly exercise .

	<brief_title>Heat &amp; Aerobic Training ( HEAT ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Exercise associate enhance cognitive functioning . Several physiological mechanism change propose , include increase blood-flow , vascular functioning , neurological change . Similar outcome also associate partial-body full-body heat therapy ( e.g . steam-room dry-sauna ) . The purpose study compare full-body HEAT treatment combine exercise 14-week program exercise-only condition . The exercise program involve moderate-intensity aerobic exercise training . All participant also ask adhere American Heart Association 's guideline reduce control blood pressure , include increase physical activity ( least 50 minute , 3 times/week part supervise training session ) , stop smoke altogether , eat healthier ( limit sodium , eat fruit , veggie , low-fat dairy lean protein , reduce saturate fat total fat ) , drink less alcohol ( 1-2 drink day max ) achieve maintain healthy bodyweight ( strive body mass index 18 25 ) . It hypothesize heat treatment combine exercise enhance body 's adaptive response exercise turn , reduce blood pressure &amp; blood flow , improve cognitive functioning relate psychosocial outcome ( include anxiety mindfulness ) . A two-armed ( parallel group design ) randomize control trial involve heat aerobic training ( HEAT ) compare exercise ( ExOnly ) control condition . Therefore , HEAT group receive 42 exercise class follow heat treatment involve 11-20 minute steam-room therapy . Post-exercise time match control condition participant sit lobby session . The exercise intervention assessment conduct trained exercise staff . The participant assess baseline post-intervention . Additionally , brief assessment administer session ( pre post ) log administer participant weekly basis . Assessments include ( ) physical activity &amp; biometric monitoring , ( b ) performance neurocognitive test , ( c ) endothelial function , ( ) battery psychosocial questionnaire , ( e ) functional performance measure .</detailed_description>
