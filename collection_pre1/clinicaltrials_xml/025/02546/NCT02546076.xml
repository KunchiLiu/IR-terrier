	<brief_summary>Skin injury due trauma relatively common , patient concerned scar cause trauma primary repair . Recently , use ablative non-ablative laser base fractional approach become novel strategy treatment scar . The objective study compare efficacy dual-mode Er : YAG laser deliver pulse either without heat/coagulation cohort patient long keloid/hypertrophic scar . The main hypothesis ablative fractional laser without heat/coagulation equivalent laser heat/coagulation term scar volume reduction , secondary hypothesis ablative fractional laser without heat/coagulation superior term post-operative erythema hypopigmentation reduction .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Dual-mode ER : YAG Laser Patients With Long Keloid/Hypertrophic Scars</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Skin injury , laceration abrasion , due trauma relatively common , patient concerned scar cause trauma primary repair . Multiple modality improve clinical appearance scar attempt vary success , include corticosteroid , dermabrasion , surgical revision , chemical peeling , silicone gel application , pressure therapy , radiation . Lasers carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) , erbium : yttrium-aluminum-garnet ( Er : YAG ) , pulse dye ( PDL ) laser use differ success treatment scar . The goal treatment soften depression stimulate neocollagenesis order fill residual defect . Ablative laser use skin resurfacing , CO2 Er : YAG laser , reduce various scar , significant adverse effect limit use , patient downtime extensive . Owing potential risk , nonablative laser develop safe alternative ablative laser resurfacing , report effective safe scar . However outcomes remained unsatisfactory require several treatment achieve satisfactory efficacy . Recently , use ablative non-ablative laser base fractional approach become novel strategy treatment scar , author suggest treatment fractional laser various scar , postoperative , atrophic , acne scar , demonstrate safely improve appearance scar . However , lack study compare coagulation modality laser . Objective The objective study compare efficacy dual-mode Er : YAG laser deliver pulse either without heat/coagulation cohort patient long keloid/hypertrophic scar . Methods This single center , investigator initiate , double blind , within-subject split-lesion design , equivalence randomize clinical study . Consecutive patient , refer Dermatology outpatient fulfil inclusion criterion , include . Participants randomly assign get treatment Er : YAG laser half scar section side equally split lesion area two symmetric uniform part . One side treat coagulation one without . In case multiple lesion per patient , large uniform one select study purpose .</detailed_description>
