	<brief_title>The Effect Of NS-0200 Versus Placebo On Hepatic Fat Content In Patients With Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , 16-week , placebo-controlled , double-blind study evaluate effect two fixed-dose combination leucine , metformin sildenafil , NS-0200 compare placebo , reduction liver fat patient diagnose non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) . Subjects meet inclusion criterion exclusion criterion randomize one three study arm . The primary objective study evaluate change hepatic fat content assess proton-density-fat-fraction ( PDFF ) employ magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) subject : Screening/Visit 2 ( Day-7/Week-1 ) Study Termination/Visit 8 ( Day 112/Week 16 ) receive two fixed-dose combination leucine , metformin sildenafil compare placebo . Secondary objective also assess change serum alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) activity , change circulate cytokeratin 18 , surrogate marker necro-inflammation , change HbA1c , change fast glucose , insulin insulin sensitivity , change blood lipid cholesterol , LDL , HDL , triglycerides , change C-reactive protein . In addition study evaluate safety tolerability NS-0200 . Patients two screen visit , first determine eligibility base lab test second base percentage hepatic fat assess MRI image . Once qualified , patient randomly assign either one treatment group placebo control group monitor total 16 week . Patients return clinic month lab test , routine examination . At conclusion treatment period patient undergo MRI scan examine percentage hepatic fat .</detailed_description>
