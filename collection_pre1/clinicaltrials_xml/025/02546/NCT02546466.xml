Interventions : Participants randomly allocate receive three possible intervention : Functional Star-shape Taping , Sham Functional Taping ( intervention seven day ) Minimal Intervention ( MI ) ( one session ) . Main outcome measure : Primary outcome pain intensity posturography ass balance parameter . Low back pain related disability , global perceive effect treatment fear avoidance belief consider secondary outcome . Four measurement static posturography conduct : pre-intervention , immediately application tape , seven day post-intervention ( removal tape ) one month follow-up period . Secondary primary outcome assess three occasion : pre-intervention , seven day post-intervention one month follow-up period . All statistical analysis conduct follow principle intention treat , effect treatment calculate use linear mixed model .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Functional Taping Static Postural Control Patients With Non-specific Chronic Low Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Considering evidence suggest patient CLBP change postural control , highlight importance conduct study identify treatment strategy influence postural control like FT . In way , objective present study compare effect Functional Star-shape Taping ( FST ) vs. Sham-FT vs. MI pain intensity postural control ( primary outcome ) CLBP patient . The secondary outcome low back pain related disability , global perceive effect treatment fear avoidance belief . METHODS Study design This study sham-controlled , randomize , three-arm parallel-group clinical Study participants The sample compose 120 participant ( gender ) nonspecific CLBP , refer physiotherapy clinic UENP Center Health Sciences ( Paraná state , Brazil ) . Allergy test Firstly , assessor blind treatment allocation collect baseline data perform allergy test participant . This allergy test consist apply small patch FT skin . Participants keep patch 24 hour instruct remove patch call researcher allergic reaction occur . Only patient without allergic reaction patch test schedule undergo randomization . Randomisation allocation The propose study follow recommendation describe Consolidated Standards Reporting Trials ( CONSORT ) statement ( Moher et al. , 2010 ) . Once patient accept invitation participate , give write consent assess eligibility . Firstly , one researcher gather clinical assessment allergy test exclude noneligible participant . Only patient without allergic reaction patch test schedule randomisation . After initial assessment , participant randomly assign follow simple randomisation procedure ( computerized random number ) 1 3 treatment group ( opaque seal envelope contain card use ) : ( 1 ) Functional Star-shape Taping ( FST ) , ( 2 ) Sham-FT ( 3 ) ( MI ) . The allocation sequence generate researcher involved assessment intervention , one research assistant assign participant intervention . Procedures Following allocation process , blind investigator conduct clinical assessment collect primary secondary outcome psychosocial variable . In session , another investigator certify Kinesio tape practitioner , proceed treatment accord group assignment , therefore responsible apply functional tape MI . Patients FST Sham-FT group blind intervention ( sham ) advise leave tape situ one week . The MI group receive booklet biopsychosocial education orientation ( Dupeyron et al. , 2011 ) . Initial evaluation The evaluation carry accord recommendation Initiative Methods , Measurement Pain Assessment Clinical Trials ( IMMPACT ) chronic pain ( Dworkin et al. , 2005 ) . Primary Outcomes Pain intensity Measurement pain intensity accomplish use application NPRS , consist sequence number 0 10 , 0 represent `` pain '' 10 represent `` bad pain imaginable '' ( Costa et al. , 2008 ) . Postural control force platform - Static Posturography without secondary task Static posturography evaluate use force platform ( 400 Biomec , EMG system Brazil Ltda® , São José do Campos , Brazil ) , frequency acquisition 100 Hz second-order 35 Hz low pas Butterworth filter . Posturography analysis COP carry four main parameter balance : ( 1 ) ellipse ( 95 % ) COP square centimeter ( A-COP cm2 ) ; ( 2 ) Root Mean Square oscillation COP ( RMS cm2 ) ; ( 3 ) mean speed ( MVeloc cm/s ) displacement COP anteroposterior ( A/P ) medial-lateral ( M/L ) direction ; ( 4 ) mean frequency ( MF Hz ) displacement COP anteroposterior ( A/P ) medial-lateral ( M/L ) direction ( Silva et al . 2013 ) . A modified clinical test sensory interaction balance ( CTSIBm ) ( Horn et al. , 2015 ) use measure static balance four sensory condition : ( 1 ) eye open stable surface ; ( 2 ) eye close stable surface ; ( 3 ) eye open unstable surface ; ( 4 ) eye close unstable surface . For condition , participant evaluate three time 40 second 30-second interval assessment ( Ruhe et al. , 2011 ) . For assessment static posturography secondary task , volunteer request perform fast movement shoulder flexion ( bilateral ) ( Caffaro et al. , 2014 ) . Participants train carry test maximum arm speed ( approximately 120º/seg ) amplitude 60º immediately auditory stimulus . Participants perform five movement ( open close eye ) , time interval 30 second repetition auditory stimulus precede trigger random period 0.5-2 ( Mok et al. , 2011 ) . Secondary Outcomes Disability ( Vigatto et al. , 2007 ) Participant rating global improvement satisfaction treatment - Global perceive effect ( Dworkin et al. , 2005 ) Fear avoidance belief questionnaire ( FABQ ) ( Abreu et al. , 2008 ) . Psychosocial Measures - Baseline measure Hospital anxiety depression scale - HADS ( Pais-Ribeiro et al. , 2007 ) Pain catastrophizing scale - PCS ( Sehn et al . 2012 ) Chronic Pain Self-Efficacy Scale - CPSS ( Salvetti Pimenta , 2005 ) . Interventions Functional Taping Intervention Participants subject one two possible intervention procedure FT : 1 ) Functional Star-shape Taping ( FST ) ; 2 ) Sham Functional Taping ( Sham-FT ) . The participant blind whether receive SFT , Sham-FT , two intervention perform lumbar region . The elastic adhesive bandage use 5.0 cm wide 0.5 mm thick ( Kinesio Tex Gold® brand , Kinesio Holding Corporation , Albuquerque , USA ) resistant contact water . All participant inform would receive one two type FT application . During period application , participant direct maintain daily life activity , blind respect intervention procedure receive ( sham ) . Minimal Intervention Strategy ( MI ) The MI group receive educational counseling booklet ( The Back Book recommend Dupeyron et al . ( 2011 ) . Data analysis The two primary outcome variable ( posturography pain intensity ) consider calculation sample size . For posturography , consider improvement least 20 % mean speed oscillation COP pre- immediate post-treatment ( Caffaro et al. , 2014 ) . The sample size 27 participant . The following specification consider : α=5 % 95 % statistical power effect size 0.76 F-test . For pain intensity , improvement least 20 % NPRS ( pre-treatment : 5.6 post-treatment follow-up : 4 , SD = 1.8 ) ( Dworkin et al. , 2005 ) . The sample size obtain 93 ( 31 participant per group ) . The following specification consider : α=5 % statistical power 95 % effect size 0.41 F-test . Thus , ensure power suitable assume sample loss , 120 participant consider ( least # 9 loss per group ) ( GPower 3.0.10 , University Kiel , Germany ) . The statistician give group data , data cod statistician remain blind patient ' group allocation protect patient confidentiality . The mean effect intervention group difference outcomes ( primary secondary ) calculate use linear mixed model incorporate term treatment group , time ( post-intervention follow-up ) , interaction term ( treatment subgroup time ) well psychosocial variable , sex age covariates . Secondary analysis conduct use regression model determine whether baseline score psychosocial variable ( HADS , PCS , CPSS ) moderate effect treatment ( FT , sham FT MI ) . The analyzes follow intention-to-treat principle . Additionally , analyze perform subgroup patient worse well postural control parameter determine cut-off value instability base data previously publish literature ( Caffaro et al. , 2014 ; Ruhe etal. , 2011 ) . These analyzes carry identify potential subgroup well bad rate postural control possible effect FT . The procedure perform analyze psychosocial subgroup . For analyzes , use IBM SPSS software package , version 22 ( IBM Corp , Armonk , New York ) .</detailed_description>
