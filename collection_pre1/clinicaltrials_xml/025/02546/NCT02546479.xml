	<brief_summary>Background : Scoliosis curve spine . It usually happen girls child teen . Doctors often use x-ray diagnose . The x-rays give low radiation . This may increase risk young woman get cancer later life . Researchers want learn risk . They look data already collect . Objectives : To study cancer risk repeat low radiation x-rays scoliosis . Also , study death risk relate certain scoliosis patient characteristic . These include cause , kind curvature , kinds treatment . Eligibility : Medical record woman past scoliosis study . Design : This U.S. Scoliosis Cohort include 5,000 woman diagnose 1912 1965 . Data collect woman 1980s 1990s . These come medical record , radiology log book , x-ray film . Researchers find participant , include dead . Some woman give follow-up questionnaire . Researchers want find participant today . They want identify new death participant . They want find cause death . This data add database .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Follow-Up Study People Treated Scoliosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>U.S. Scoliosis Cohort include 5,573 female spinal deformity ( 93 % scoliosis ) patient diagnose 14 medical center U.S. 1912-1965 . The primary objective study evaluate site-specific cancer risk associate repeat low-dose radiation exposure diagnostic x-ray . A secondary objective evaluate late mortality risk associate patient characteristic , etiology , degree type curvature , type treatment . The current proposal extend mortality follow-up 10 year . All patient know deceased submit National Death Index Plus identify new death obtain cause death . A feasibility study conduct four medical center Minneapolis-St. Paul , Minnesota area 1983-1987 . The primary goal feasibility study ascertain adequate number patient meet study criterion could identify locate , medical radiography record available substantially complete , organspecific radiation dos could estimate available data large enough warrant study , reasonable percentage patient would complete follow-up questionnaire . The feasibility study successful meeting goal . Enrolled study 1,030 female patient spinal deformity diagnose 1922-1965 . Medical record abstract , individual x-ray film review , patient locate , follow-up questionnaire administer identify incident cancer . Eleven breast cancer report . Scoliosis patient 80 % high breast cancer risk compare woman general population , base internal cohort analysis , breast cancer risk increase increase number x-ray estimate radiation dose breast . An expand study conduct 1988-1993 . The main goal expand study enlist collaboration suitable additional medical center large number spinal deformity patient treated 1966 , abstract data medical radiology record , trace patient vital status current location , obtain information incident cancer cancer risk factor questionnaire , medically validate report cancer , determine cause death decedent . Another 4,543 patient diagnose 1912-1965 enrolled ten hospital , bring total study population 5,573 patient . Compared woman general population , spinal deformity patient statistically significantly high risk die breast cancer , incidence mortality , breast cancer risk increase increase diagnostic radiation exposure breast . Patients also elevate risk mortality cause , circulatory , respiratory , nervous system , musculoskeletal , digestive , infectious &amp; parasitic disease , primarily relate degree spinal curvature . Additional mortality follow-up enable definitive assessment cancer disease risk radiation factor patient .</detailed_description>
