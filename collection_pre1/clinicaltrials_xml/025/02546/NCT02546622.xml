	<brief_summary>This longitudinal , observational study patient Hemophilia A B planning switch newly approve coagulation factor replacement product , recently switch factor product . The study follow patient 1 year . Patients recruit Hemophilia Treatment Centers ( HTC ) ATHN-affiliates . The primary outcome study development inhibitor ( i.e. , antibody factor ) 1 year 50 exposure day , whichever come first . The study conduct approximately 30 HTCs , plan enrollment 600 patients.The entire study duration project approximately 6 year . In addition , optional substudies include product , `` Product-Specific Modules '' . These questionnaire collect data subject receive select Factor product . For example , subject receive Eloctate approach participate 'Eloctate Product-Specific Module ' ; subject receive Adynovate approach participate 'Adynovate Product-Specific Module ' . Questions related product use , perception product use , post-marketing consumer data .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ATHN 2 : Factor Switching Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This non-interventional , minimal risk cohort study enroll patient Hemophilia A B planning recently switch new Factor product . The study 2 Arms , prospective retrospective . The Prospective Arm enroll patient plan switch new factor . The Retrospective Arm enroll patient recently switch new factor ( within previous 50 week ) . Patient see baseline 4 additional visit , quarterly follow-up phone . Required study visit plan coincide routine follow-up visit whenever possible . Please note Factor Replacement Products provide study . The primary objective ass characterize rate inhibitor development within one ( 1 ) year fifty ( 50 ) exposure day , whichever first , switch clot factor replacement product previously treat patient ( PTPs ) hemophilia A B . Data collect include eligibility , demographic , medical history , hemophilia history ( clot history , product history , genotype family history ) , inhibitor history , co-morbidities baseline ( i.e. , HIV , Hepatitis C. ) , detailed clot factor replacement product ( ) usage switch plan , reason switch factor product . Also target physical exam perform baseline follow-up , target concomitant medication data collect . Data collection also include patient-reported outcome ( ) 1 year , bleed event , surgery , laboratory Inhibitor test detail regard test methodology , pharmacokinetic ( PK ) data ( know ) , new diagnosis , co-morbidities ( target ) , Safety/Adverse Events use European Union Hemophilia Safety Surveillance ( EUHASS ) definition . This study evolve include newly approve ( since January 2013 ) factor come market . Cohorts define brand/type new clot factor replacement product approve January 1 , 2013 . The current list specific new Factor VIII replacement product include Eloctate® ( Biogen ) NovoEight® ( NovoNordisk ) ; Factor IX replacement product include Alprolix® ( Biogen ) , Rixubis® ( Baxalta ) IXinity® ( Emergent Biosolutions ) . Others imminent . The over-arching rationale protocol pragmatic study consistent real world practice across wide range patient principally tie particular manufacturer product may great advantage entire hemophilia community . Study Duration - Subjects prophylaxis follow study 1 year . Each subject see study visit contact telephone least every 3 month ( i.e. , quarterly ) . Patients may participate multiple 'cycles ' , switch factor product study actively recruit . Treatment regimen discretion subject 's hemophilia caregiver . No treatment provide study . - Substudies A number substudies plan pharmaceutical sponsor collect information patient product ' use . Participation optional substudies ( product-specific module ) plan coincide study visit . These module collect information subject perception use factor use/treatment , physical activity level general health question . These data collect via questionnaire , primarily via phone . Concomitant Excluded Therapies - Immune tolerance therapy exclude study . This include immunosuppressive treatment use eradicate inhibitor . Steroid treatment allergic disorder asthma , allow . Data Collection System - All data collect enter electronic case report form ( eCRFs ) within secure ATHN Study Manager system . Subject Identifiers ( IDs ) generate Clinical Manager . - Reimbursement manage participate HTC . Most study center reimburse study subject travel parking , varies center .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Moderate Severe Congenital Hemophilia A B ( FVIII FIX clot activity less equal 5 % normal ) . Able give inform consent ( patient parent/authorized guardian ) . Previously treat plasmaderived recombinant clot factor replacement product least 50 exposure day ( assessed either direct clinical record child age 5 , clinical history dose old patient ) . For Arm B enrol retrospectively , previous treatment must prior product switch study . Planning switch , recently switch within previous 50 week , new brand type replacement factor VIII IX , FDA approve January 1 , 2013 . Arm B : Negative inhibitor screen within last 6 month prior switch . Note : History prior transient inhibitor inhibitor eradicate immune tolerance induction ( ITI ) eligible . Exclusion Criteria Presence know bleed disorder hemophilia A B ( i.e. , patient concurrent hemophilia second hemostatic defect NOT eligible ) . Low Von Willebrand Factor ( VWF ) without VWF diagnosis exclude . Presence active inhibitor &gt; 0.6 BU factor VIII , &gt; 0.4 BU factor IX time eligibility assessment . Detection inhibitor baseline visit prior dose new product ( Arm A ) , dose new factor dosing ( Arm B ) , would result early termination without study assessment . Currently undergo ITI . Immunosuppressive therapy ( cyclophosphamide , mycophenolate , IVIG ) within 90 day Rituximab within 6 month ; topical steroid treatment short course steroid asthma allergy allow . Previous participation Phase I , II III interventional trial factor product switch .</criteria>
