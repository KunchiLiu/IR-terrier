	<brief_summary>It recognize eosinophilic airway inflammation likely respond steroid treatment . However , real-world practice , difficult routinely assess airway inflammation use sputum induction technical facility requirement . COPD ( chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ) heterogeneous disease remain great challenge identify patient eosinophilic airway inflammation respond steroid treatment well . A recent study demonstrate elevated plasma D-dimer associate acute inflammation significant predictor pulmonary embolism COPD exacerbate patient . D-dimer may potentially act marker inflammation predictor cardiovascular event COPD patient . The investigator preliminary study demonstrate exhaled nitric oxide ( eNO ) &gt; 23.5 ppb good surrogate marker predict eosinophilic airway inflammation COPD patient newly diagnose untreated least 3 month . There significant correlation among sputum eosinophil , eNO serum total immunoglobulin E ( IgE ) . Particularly , eNO predict sputum eosinophilia ( &gt; 3 % ) COPD sensitivity specificity 62 % 71 % respectively . Herein , investigator test hypothesis eNO may act biomarker determine treatment option COPD .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exhaled NO Based Treatment Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) , ICS/LABA Versus LAMA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eligible COPD patient ( newly diagnose untreated least 3 month ) enrol out-patient clinic consenting participant . Upon enrollment , exhale NO ( eNO ) measure patient categorize 2 group accord eNO level : either high exhale NO ( great equal 23.5 ppb ) low eNO ( &lt; 23.5 ppb ) group . In group , patient randomize receive either 2 inhalation fluticasone/salmeterol 250/25 mcg/ pudd twice daily 2 inhalation tiotropium 2.5 mcg/inhalation 12 week follow scheduled visit . Testing outcome measure include eNO , lung function , different count mediator induce sputum , test following timing : ( baseline , week 0 ) , treatment ( week 4 week 12 ) . Rescue medication drug compliance record .</detailed_description>
