	<brief_summary>Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) chronic immune-mediated disease central nervous system , accompany vary inflammatory manifestation , demyelinization axonal loss . With chronic progressive relapsing-remitting disease onset person MS ( pwMS ) progressively develop impaired functional capacity show reduce physical activity cognitive decline compare healthy control . The primary aim rehabilitation pwMS therefore increase level activity participation lead increase independence participant . In general exercise range passive physiotherapy-based intervention submaximal endurance training session . Current recommendation advise pwMS exercise match individual performance capacity . Exercise training pwMS potential target improve many component outline ICF-model . Cytokines neurotrophic factor receive increased attention MS research address brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) important mediator neuronal regeneration link effect exercise MS pathogenesis . Data show positive connection elevate neurotrophin concentration , induction neuroplasticity , recovery motor cognitive function apply train intensity . Similarly , intensive progressive exercise bout seem great benefit cardiorespiratory fitness maximum voluntary strength elderly senior dementia . Therefore , specific exercise prescription may necessary target specific impairment also pwMS . This study aim evaluate two different train modality ( intensive versus normal ) pwMS . It expect modality improve cardiorespiratory fitness cognitive function pwMS . Based finding higher train intensity facilitate great benefit , expect pwMS tolerate intensive training intensity show positive connection elevate neurotrophin concentration . The result help clear understand benefit type exercise convey pwMS assist development patient-specific exercise prescription .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study aim evaluate two different train modality ( intensive versus normal ) pwMS . It expect modality improve cardiorespiratory fitness cognitive function pwMS . Based finding higher train intensity facilitate great benefit , expect pwMS tolerate intensive training intensity show positive connection elevate neurotrophin concentration . Primary outcome acute ( CPET ) chronic ( 3-week training intervention ) change neurotrophic factor cognitive function . All measure secondary outcome ( Training value : VO2peak , Workload , Heart rate ; Fatigue : FSMC ; Anxiety Depression : HADS . Participants eligible hold definite diagnosis multiple sclerosis ( revise McDonald criterion ) , EDSS score 1.0 -6.0 , give write consent , severe cardiovascular exacerbation ( RR &gt; 240/120 , HR age predict maximum 220-Age ) persistent , hold severe cognitive impairment , face severe disease progression relapse . Main measurement procedure include : Blood sampling : Blood sample ( 10ml ) primary outcome take vein puncture antecubital vein seat position exercise bout straight reach VO2peak cool , participant still seat ergometer . Before sample take participant require relax 10 minute , blood sample take approximately 5 minute . Cardiopulmonary Exercise Test ( CPET ) : Cardiorespiratory fitness assess progressive CPET perform baseline cycle ergometer t1 repeat day prior discharge t2 . The exercise protocol consist ( ) first 3 minute rest ( pedal ) cycle ergometer ; ( b ) 3 minute unload pedal warm ; ( c ) test phase participant reach symptom limited maximum . Workload continuously ramp type increase 5-10 Watts every minute ensure 8-12 minute test ; ( ) final 3 minute unload pedal cool . Heart rate ( Polar Electro , Kempele , Finland ) blood pressure ( Riva-Rocci ) monitor last 10 second every 2 minute test . The 10-point BORG scale therapy short-form ass rate perceive exertion ( RPE ) phase ( c ) ( ) . Blood sample draw rest prior phase ( ) end CPET phase ( ) t1 t2 Cognitive assessment : Cognitive assessment perform use German version Brief International Cognitive Assessment Multiple Sclerosis ( BICAMS ) . Additionally , German version Trail-Making-Pencil-Test version A/B ( TMT-A/B ) Go/noGo ( TAP version ) use . Cognitive assessment perform baseline ( t1 ) repeat t2 . Fatigue : Fatigue assess multidimensional FSMC scale CPET rest condition . FSMC define cut-off score classify mildly , moderately severely fatigued patient . Cut-off fatigue set total score 43 motoric cognitive sub-scores 22 . The scale proven test-retest liability translate multiple language . Depression Anxiety : Depression anxiety assess Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale ( HADS ) . The HADS self-assessment questionnaire adult physical ailment assess anxiety depression . The questionnaire consist 14 item seven anxiety seven depression high score indicate anxiety depression . Training : Endurance training group consist physiologically define heart rate control cycle 50-60 round per minute ( rpm ) progressive resistance training . All participant stratify accord cardiorespiratory fitness level cognitive fatigue group Intensive Training ( IT ) Normal Training ( NT ) . Training group differ applied intensity frequency . The IT train less frequent training session intensive effect . Training perform daily six session ( three morning three afternoon session ) , synchronize individually match ratio active versus passive session 2:1 . The NT normal training perform daily routine outline usual care Valens clinic . Training perform maximal eight training session synchronize individually match ratio active versus passive session .</detailed_description>
