	<brief_title>Bioequivalence Study - Reference Clinical Fexinidazole Tablet Versus Proposed Market Formulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ideally , BE study conduct fast condition consider sensitive condition detect potential difference formulation . However fexinidazole recommend take food , food increase plasma concentration 2.5 3 fold compare plasma . BE conduct fed condition , use field adapt meal . The wash-out period sufficient ensure drug concentration limit quantification subject begin next period , 2 week wash-out period use . The intra-subject variability fexinidazole evaluate base previous 3-period cross-over study ( 1 ) estimate 25 % . As value quite high close 30 % , replicate design choose . Primary objective : To assess BE clinical trial 600 mg tablet formulation versus ( vs. ) propose market 600 mg tablet formulation fexinidazole feed condition single oral administration 1200 mg . Secondary objective : To assess pharmacokinetic profile two metabolite fexinidazole sulfoxide fexinidazole sulfone feed condition . To assess safety tolerability healthy volunteer study condition . Meal : On treatment period , fexinidazole give concomitant meal composition close possible field condition sample size : In order 24 evaluable subject total 30 subject recruit study . Study Treatment : Single oral dose 1200 mg / period : - Treatment R : Reference formulation , i.e . 2 × 600 mg clinical tablet - Treatment T : Test formulation , i.e . 2 × 600 mg propose market tablets Pharmacokinetic sampling : Pre-dose , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 8 , 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 , 72 , 120 168 h post-dose Total blood drawn : 390 mL ( Pharmacokinetic = 240 mL + safety = 150 mL )</detailed_description>
