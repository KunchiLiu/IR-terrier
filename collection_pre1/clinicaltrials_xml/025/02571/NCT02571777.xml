	<criteria>Patients diagnosis asthma , ( GINA 2015 ≥ step 4 ) period least 1 year prior Visit 1 ( Screening ) . Patients use ICS/LABA combination asthma least 1 year stable medium high dos ICS/LABA least 1 month prior Visit 1 . Patients must symptomatic screen despite treatment mid high stable dos ICS/LABA . Patients ACQ7 score ≥ 2 Visit 101 Visit 102 ( randomization ) ( GINA 2015≥ step 4 ) . Patients documented history least one asthma exacerbation require medical care physician , ER visit ( local equivalent structure ) hospitalization 12 month prior Visit 1 , require systemic corticosteroid treatment . Prebronchodilator FEV1 &lt; 80 % predict normal value patient accord ATS/ERS guideline withhold bronchodilator visit 101 102 . Withholding period bronchodilator prior spirometry : SABA ≥ 6 hr , Twice daily LABA ( FDC ICS/LABA ) ≥ 12 hr , Once daily LABA ( FDC ICS/LABA ) ≥ 24 hr , SAMA ≥ 8 hr , Short act xanthine 12 hr , Long act xanthine 24 hr , . A one=time repeat percentage predict FEV1 ( Prebronchodilator ) allow . Repeat spirometry do adhoc visit schedule date would provide sufficient time receive confirmation spirometry data central reviewer validity assessment randomization . Spacer device permit reversibility test . Patients demonstrate increase FEV1 12 % 200 mL within 30 minute administration 400 µg salbutamol/360 µg albuterol ( equivalent dose ) Visit 101.All patient must perform reversibility test Visit 101 . If reversibility demonstrate Visit 101 one follow criterion need meet . Reversibility repeat . Patients may permit enter study historical evidence reversibility perform accord ATS/ERS guideline within 1 year prior Visit 1 . Alternatively , patient may permit enter study historical positive bronchoprovocation test perform within 2 year prior Visit 1 . If reversibility demonstrate Visit 101 ( repeat assessment adhoc visit ) historical evidence reversibility/bronchoprovocation available ( perform accord American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society ( ATS/ERS ) guideline patient must screen failed Patients asthma attack/exacerbation require systemic steroid hospitalization emergency room visit within 6 week Visit 1 ( Screening ) . If patient experience asthma attack/exacerbation require systemic steroid hospitalization emergency room visit Visit 1 Visit 102 may rescreened 6 week recovery exacerbation . Patients ever require intubation severe asthma attack/exacerbation . Patients clinical condition likely worsen ICS administration ( e.g . glaucoma , cataract fragility fracture ) accord investigator 's medical judgment risk participate study . Patients treat LAMA asthma within 3 month prior Visit 1 ( Screening ) . Patients narrowangle glaucoma , symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia ( BPH ) bladderneck obstruction severe renal impairment urinary retention . BPH patient stable treatment consider ) . Patients respiratory tract infection asthma worsen determined investigator within 4 week prior Visit 1 ( Screening ) Visit 1 Visit 102 . Patients may rescreened 4 week recovery respiratory tract infection asthma worsen . Patients evidence upon visual inspection ( laboratory culture require ) clinically significant ( opinion investigator ) oropharyngeal candidiasis Visit 102 early , without treatment . Patients may rescreened candidiasis treat resolve . Patients chronic condition affect upper respiratory tract ( e.g . chronic sinusitis ) opinion investigator may interfere study evaluation optimal participation study . Patients history chronic lung disease asthma , include ( limited ) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , sarcoidosis , interstitial lung disease , cystic fibrosis , clinically significant bronchiectasis active tuberculosis . Patients Type I diabetes uncontrolled Type II diabetes . Patients , either judgment investigator responsible Novartis personnel , clinically significant condition ( limited ) unstable ischemic heart disease , New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class III/IV leave ventricular failure arrhythmia , uncontrolled hypertension , cerebrovascular disease , psychiatric disease , neurodegenerative disease , neurological disease , uncontrolled hypo hyperthyroidism autoimmune disease , hypokalemia , hyperadrenergic state , ophthalmologic disorder patient medical condition might compromise patient safety compliance , interfere evaluation , preclude completion study . Patients paroxysmal ( e.g. , intermittent ) atrial fibrillation exclude . Patients persistent atrial fibrillation define continuous atrial fibrillation least 6 month control rate control strategy ( i.e. , selective beta blocker , calcium channel blocker , pacemaker placement , digoxin ablation therapy ) least 6 month may consider inclusion . In patient , atrial fibrillation must present runin visit ( Visit 101 ) rest ventricular rate &lt; 100/min . At Visit 101 atrial fibrillation must confirm central reading . Patients history myocardial infarction within previous 12 month . Concomitant use agent know prolong QT interval unless permanently discontinue duration study Patients history long QT syndrome whose QTc measure Visit 101 ( Fridericia method ) prolong ( &gt; 450 msec male &gt; 460 msec female ) confirm central assessor ( patient rescreened ) . Patients history hypersensitivity lactose , study drug similar drug within class include untoward reaction sympathomimetic amine inhale medication component thereof . Patients achieve acceptable spirometry result Visit 101 accordance ATS /ERS criterion acceptability repeatability . Patients unable use Concept1 dry powder inhaler , Accuhaler meter dose inhaler . Spacer device permit . History alcohol substance abuse . Patients known history noncompliance medication unable unwilling complete patient diary unable unwilling use Electronic Peak Flow ediary device .
