	<brief_title>Asthmatuner Self-management App Asthma : A Randomized Controlled Multicentre Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>2 . Background Clinical gap hamper proper asthma management , lead delay undiagnosed disease , poor adherence treatment , inadequate self-care ability , inadequate understanding disease severity , poor patient education , inadequate measurement lung function , inconsistent evaluation symptom . To improve patient 's ability self-manage overcome clinical gap , evidence emphasizes clinic offer comprehensive patient education . The national Finish asthma programme ( 1994-2004 ) focus apply effective strategy asthma management , result , patient 's self-management improve , cost-effective limited demand health-care social security system . Novel application embody smartphones straightforward alternative facilitate health care support patient hands-on guidance self-management asthma . Asthmatuner smartphone app enable evaluation lung function symptom . The app provide patient daily treatment plan adjust symptom lung function . Additionally , information accessible assess health care provider back-end system . Future version Asthmatuner enable patient 's medical record . Self-management apps hands-on guidance self-management asthma present promising future close clinical gap , overall benefit use service treatment asthma need comprehensive evaluation answer scientific question end-user opinion . 3 . Aims The primary aim evaluate Asthmatuner clinical effect patients´ self-reported asthma control test ( score ACT/C-ACT ) . The secondary aim evaluate effect patients´ HR-QoL medical adherence . Primary outcomes The primary outcome score ACT/C-ACT Paediatric asthma quality life questionnaire ( PAQLQ ) Mini-Asthma Quality Life Questionnaire ( Mini-AQLQ ) . Secondary outcomes The secondary outcome score Medicine adherence report scale ( MARS ) cost prescribed dose type control medication total amount direct indirect cost patient/caregiver . 4 . Material method 4.1 Data collection Questionnaires : - A health questionnaire complete first visit provide information regard asthma medical history , health utilization , annual income employment status . - ACT use assess asthma control patient 12 year old , C-ACT child age 6 11 year . A mean score equal 19 indicates uncontrolled asthma . Scores 19 defines asthma control test . - HR-QoL applied patient 6 11 year age use validated Swedish translate Paediatric Asthma Quality Life Questionnaire ( PAQLQ ) , mini Asthma Quality Life Questionnaire ( mini-AQLQ ) patient 12 year age . - Self-reported medication adherence measure five-item MARS , develop assess adherence asthma medication . The MARS comprise statement medication use behavior . The patient ask answer behavior score 1-5 base follow alternative ; `` always '' , `` often '' , `` sometimes '' , `` rarely '' `` never '' . A mean MARS score calculate , score 4.5 great indicates good adherence . - Time consume , utility satisfaction use Asthmatuner ask patient/caregiver , nurse physician relation apply management . 4.2 Subjects Two stratify group diagnose asthma ( male female ) invite study ; child adolescent ( 6-17 year ) lung allergy department Astrid Lindgren child 's Hospital adolescent ( &gt; 12 year ) adults primary care sector Stockholm . Inclusion criterion - Consent participate voluntary . - Age &gt; 6 year - Diagnosed asthma - Asthma control score ( ACT/C-ACT ) less 20 Exclusion criterion - Ongoing comorbidity affect health status asthma - Asthma control score ( ACT/C-ACT ) equal 20 - Participation drug trial 4.3 Power analysis The power analysis base previous analysis ACT/C-ACT HR-QoL score schoolchildren uncontrolled severe asthma [ 21 ] . The score severe uncontrolled asthma average ACT 17 ( SD 3.3 ) PAQLQ 5.4 ( SD 0.77 ) . Thus , estimate improvement ACT 17 19 ( two point ) PAQLQ 5.4 5.9 ( 0.5 point ) require 38-43 patient group ( Asthmatuner vs. conventional management ) attain 80 % power 5 % significance level . 4.4 Study design The study design randomize , multi-centre , blinded-controlled , crossover trail . Patients enrol randomized 1:1 visit 1 . Computer-generated random number sequence use randomization patient one two-arms 8 + 8 week asthma management ; Asthmatuner - conventional conventional - Asthmatuner . The randomization keep blind study team study nurse physician . A washout period minimum 2 week apply management period . Management period 2 initiated visit 3 finalize visit 4 . The clinical setting nurse-based asthma clinic currently regard state-of-the-art conventional asthma treatment primary health care Sweden . The study therefore conduct primary care set integrate asthma nurse follow establish national international guideline . 4.5 Intervention procedure Study nurse physicians consecutively recruit participant asthma clinic . At enrollment Asthmatuner , physician prescribe three level treatment plan , adjust patients´ status asthma control , partly control uncontrolled . Study nurse insert plan back-end system Asthmatuner . Before enrolment conventional management , separate write treatment plan adjust patient asthma apply participant medical journal . Visit 1 : Eligibility participant check . The patient give information study procedure must sign informed consent form . At visit follow procedure conduct document : - Demographic data - Body height weight - Medical history allergy asthma obtain health questionnaire - Asthma control assess ACT C-ACT - HR-QoL ; Mini-AQLQ PAQLQ - MARS questionnaire - Lung function , dynamic spirometry include force vital capacity ( FVC ) , forced expiratory volume one second ( FEV1 ) , FEV1/FVC , force expiratory flow 50 % vital capacity ( FEF50 ) - Randomization ; Asthmatuner - conventional self-management conventional - Asthmatuner - Prescribe apply treatment plan ( Asthmatuner Conventional ) - Control inhalation technique At visit 2 , follow procedure conduct document : - ACT/C-ACT - HR-QoL ; Mini-AQLQ/PAQLQ - MARS - Lung function , dynamic spirometry ( FVC , FEV1 , FEV1/FVC FEF50 ) - Revise treatment plan necessary ( Asthmatuner Conventional ) - Revision adverse event . At visit 3 , follow procedure conduct document : - ACT/C-ACT - HR-QoL ; Mini-AQLQ/PAQLQ - MARS - Lung function , dynamic spirometry ( FVC , FEV1 , FEV1/FVC FEF50 ) - Prescribe apply treatment plan ( Asthmatuner Conventional ) - Control inhalation technique - Revision adverse event . At visit 4 , follow procedure conduct document : - ACT/C-ACT - HR-QoL ; Mini-AQLQ PAQLQ - MARS - Lung function , dynamic spirometry include force vital capacity ( FVC ) , forced expiratory volume one second ( FEV1 ) , FEV1/FVC , force expiratory flow 50 % vital capacity ( FEF50 ) - Revision adverse event 4.5 Statistical analysis The study hypothesis test examine patients´ change baseline asthma control ( ACT/C-ACT ) , HR-QoL ( PAQLQ/Mini-AQLQ ) , MARS score asthma management group . Results summarize group mean score analyse pair t-tests . 4.8 Withdrawal A patient withdrawn trial , opinion investigator , medically necessary , wish patient . In circumstance reason withdrawal document Study termination report . Participants discontinue study reason replace . 4.9 Safety An adverse event ( AE ) untoward medical occurrence participant use use Asthmatuner . AE include follow : - All suspect adverse reaction - All reaction medical overdose , abuse , withdrawal , sensitivity toxicity - Apparently unrelated illness , include worsen preexist illness - Injury accident - Abnormalities physiological test physical examination - Laboratory abnormality require clinical intervention investigation unless associate already report clinical event . Preexisting condition In trial , preexist condition i.e . asthma , report adverse event unless condition worsens episodes increase ( i.e . exacerbation ) frequency adverse event reporting period . Procedures Diagnostics therapeutic non-invasive invasive procedure , surgery , report adverse event . However , medical condition procedure perform report meet definition AE . The AE reporting period begin upon start use Asthmatuner conventional management ( visit 1 ) . Each participant question AE visit 2 3 . All AE occur trial report investigator specify participants´ medical journal separate AE form follow information : - Type AE - Date time AE - Association Asthmatuner ( No/Yes/Unknown ) - Gravity ( Serious Non-serious ) - Reporting time - Follow-up ( resolve unresolved ) Gravity Each AE classify investigator serious non-serious . This classification gravity event determine report procedure follow . An AE meet one follow criterion classify serious : - Death - Life-threatening - Hospitalization - Persistent significant disability/incapacity - Congenital anomaly/birth defect All serious AE directly report investigator . 5.0 Ethics The trial perform accordance World Medical Assembly Helsinki recommendation guide physician biomedical research involve human subject [ 26 ] . It responsibility investigator obtain approval trial regional ethic committee´ . It responsibility investigator give patient prior inclusion trial , full adequate information regard trial procedure . The patient must inform right withdraw trial time . Written patient information must give patient enrollment . In addition , responsibility investigator obtain sign informed consent participant .</detailed_description>
