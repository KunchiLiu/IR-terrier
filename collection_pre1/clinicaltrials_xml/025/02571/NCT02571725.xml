	<brief_summary>Of approximately 21,000 case ovarian cancer diagnose annually U.S , ten percent attribute hereditary syndrome , commonly result mutation breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 2 ( BRCA1 BRCA2 ) . Mutation gene result inability repair double-stranded break DNA . Treating tumor poly ( adenosine diphosphate [ ADP ] -ribose ) polymerase ( PARP ) inhibitor result specific kill BRCA negative cell block second DNA-repair mechanism . Treatment ovarian cancer patient PARP inhibitor result improved progression free survival ( PFS ) , overall survival ( OS ) . It 's completely understood case , preclinical study use ovarian cancer model mice suggest combine PARP inhibitor immune system modulators like T cell checkpoint inhibitor improve long-term survival . Therefore , purpose study evaluate safety efficacy combination PARP inhibitor ( Olaparib ) T cell checkpoint inhibitor ( anti-CTLA-4 antibody Tremelimumab ) woman recurrent BRCA mutation-associated ovarian cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PARP-inhibition CTLA-4 Blockade BRCA-deficient Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The mechanism action Olaparib , potent inhibitor mammalian PARP-1 , PARP-2 , PARP-3 , propose involve trap inactivate PARP onto single-stranded break prevent repair generate potential block cellular DNA replication . In tumor homologous recombination deficiency , BRCA mutation , single agent treatment Olaparib lead cell death tumor regression process know synthetic lethality . Tremelimumab human monoclonal immunoglobulin G2 ( IgG2 ) antibody specific human cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 ( CTLA-4 ) , co-inhibitory receptor express activated T cell . Tremelimumab show block inhibitory signal mediate interaction human CTLA-4 activate T cell B7-1 B7-2 antigen-presenting cell . This think maintain T cell activation tumor microenvironment promote establishment tumor-specific immune response . Like melanoma , ovarian cancer associate significant tumor heterogeneity , also rational target immune therapy . Although antitumor effect observe patient epithelial ovarian cancer response anti-CTLA-4 antibody treatment , evidence clinical disease regression demonstrate . Based data indicate subset ovarian cancer associate germline mutation BRCA1/2 gene may immunogenic , hypothesize BRCA-negative tumor would particularly vulnerable checkpoint blockade , immune priming target cytotoxic therapy use PARP-inhibitor would sensitize ovarian tumor immune therapy optimize patient survival . We demonstrate pre-clinical model high grade BRCA1-negative ovarian cancer . Based significant therapeutic benefit demonstrate pre-clinical model , clinical trial evaluate combination Olaparib Tremelimumab woman recurrent BRCA-deficient ovarian cancer .</detailed_description>

Patients must confirm germline mutation BRCA1 BRCA2 gene Patients must measurable disease define World Health Organization ( WHO ) criterion : least 1 lesion accurately measure least 1 dimension ( long diameter record ) . Each lesion must &gt; 1.0cm measured CT , MRI , caliper measurement clinical exam ; &gt; 2.0cm measure chest xray . Lymph node must &gt; 1.5cm short axis measure CT MRI Patients platinumsensitive platinumresistant disease eligible Patients must receive least 1 prior course platinumbased chemotherapy management primary disease include carboplatin , cisplatin , another platinum compound There restriction total number prior regimen patient may receive Gynecologic Oncology Group ( GOG ) performance status 0 , 1 , 2 Adequate organ marrow function define : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; 1,500/mcl Platelets &gt; 100,000/mcl Creatinine &lt; 1.5x institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) Bilirubin &lt; 1.5x ULN Aspartate aminotransferase Alanine aminotransferase &lt; 3x ULN Alkaline phosphatase &lt; 2.5x ULN Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test prior study entry agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry , duration study participation , 180 day follow completion therapy Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document Patients must meet preentry requirement specify Recovery effect recent surgery , radiotherapy , chemotherapy must demonstrate Patients free active infection require antibiotic therapy ( except uncomplicated urinary tract infection ) Hormonal therapy direct treatment cancer must discontinue least 1 week prior enrollment . Hormone replacement therapy symptom management permit . Any therapy direct treat cancer include chemotherapy , biologic/targeted agent , immunologic agent , must discontinue least 3 week prior enrollment . Any prior radiation therapy must discontinue least 4 week prior enrollment . A history autoimmune disorder vitiligo ( e.g. , psoriasis , extensive atopic dermatitis , asthma , inflammatory bowel disease , multiple sclerosis , uveitis , vasculitis ) , chronic inflammatory condition , condition require concurrent use systemic immunosuppressant steroid reason exclude study . Any patient allotransplant kind would exclude well , include xenograft heart valve . Mild , intermittent asthma require occasional betaagonist inhaler use mild localized eczema exclude . Chronic use immunesuppressive drug ( i.e. , systemic corticosteroid use management cancer noncancer relate illness , e.g. , COPD ) . Known HIVpositive patient acquired/inherited immunodeficiency ineligible due possibility affect response tremelimumab , high risk active opportunistic infection . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition olaparib tremelimumab , agent use study . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Concomitant use know potent cytochrome P450 isoform 3A4 ( CYP3A4 ) inhibitor Persistent toxicity ( &gt; Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Event ( CTCAE ) grade 2 ) cause prior cancer therapy , exclude alopecia Must pregnant nursing potential regimen harm nursing infant evaluate . Patients receive investigational agent For Phase 2 , inclusion/exclusion criterion apply . In addition , follow exclusion criterion apply : Resting electrocardiogram correct QT interval ( QTc ) &gt; 470msec two time point within 24hr period , family history long QT syndrome Patients previously receive antiCTLA4 antibody therapy</criteria>
