	<detailed_description>The typical pattern cognitive deficit HIV reflect degrade brain network functioning , likely due combination brain health insult : generic ( age ) , HIV-specific ( inflammation , diffuse demyelination inherent vulnerability varies across individual ) . Consistent view , cognitive domain affect rely extend network ( e.g . attention executive function rely fronto-parietal fronto-striatal circuit ) , exquisite timing ( psychomotor function ) , . These network-based cognitive function vulnerable , also resilient : high degree learning-dependent plasticity network involve frontal lobe . This argue cognitive deficit HIV may amenable remediation cognitive training , suggest mechanism might occur . There many form cognitive rehabilitation ; approach take advantage advance understand mechanisms neuroplasticity neural system support human cognition likely high yield . In study , make use Plasticity-based Adaptive Cognitive Remediation ( PACR ) , powerful method harness plastic potential . Conceptually , PACR apply well-understood technique derive brain plasticity implicit/procedural/perceptual learning improve speed accuracy information processing , exercise design drive generalized improvement . Simultaneously , exercise heavily engage neuromodulatory system re-establish normal control learn memory . As individual restores degrade ability intensive procedural learning , encode naturalistic information significantly improve , result declarative memory cognitive function base quality incoming information necessarily improve well , lead improvement generalize beyond trained task . Multiple randomize controlled study demonstrate PACR improves cognitive functional ability patient population cognitive dysfunction similar type magnitude patient cognitive deficit due HIV . PACR run web browser Internet connect computer implement engage game-like format . The participant select one cognitive exercise schedule day , performs exercise fifteen minute . The exercise contain core science stimulus task build game-like experience . Participants perform ten hundred trial course fifteen-minute session , trial provide auditory visual feedback reward indicate trial perform correctly incorrectly . After trial , difficulty next trial updated ensure within session , participant get ~85 % trial correct . Thus , train individually tailor maximize effectiveness . Summary screen include game metric ( point , level ) exercise metric ( usage , progress ) show participant end session . The schedule mechanism ensure patient progress exercise define order , generally move simple ( early sensory processing ) exercise complex ( multimodal , cognitive control ) exercise course 8 week experience . At point time , participant access subset ( typically six ) exercise , four perform per day . Each exercise specific criterion completion , criterion meet exercise remove active set next exercise add . This mechanism ensure ongoing novelty engagement participant , participant progress smoothly complete set exercise program use period . Free access provide PACR program , tailor cognitive training program develop French English , specifically target domain mechanisms affect HIV . This include selection suitable training module ( 12 plan ) , optimization Web-based presentation feedback ensure acceptability target group . The treatment goal use assign program 30 minute session , five session per week , 8 week randomization ; program use mix home ( community Internet resource ) in-clinic session . The outcome responder status ( define improvement &gt; 0.5 logits ) B-CAM . With assumption outcome drawn binomial distribution expect probability response 10 % ( n=3 ) intervention , 30 subject immediate training group allow detection positive response P &lt; 0.05 7 person respond . The observed response group provide accurate estimate plan scale work full trial . An exploratory analysis evaluate response complete least 60 % training session , recognize power reduce , information nonetheless important . Participants group also compare eligible randomization intervention platform whole . Generalized estimate equation ( GEE ) apply secondary , general approach permit time point model , consideration outcomes . This accommodate either binary ( responder status ) continuous ( score cognitive test ) outcomes . This analysis use regression model , cluster outcome within time control . For binary outcome , effect group ( immediate control ) express odds ratio ; continuous outcome parameter effect size equivalent adjust paired-t-test . An interaction term test whether effect differ group ( i.e . large immediate training group hypothesize ) . Additional analysis use explain change B-CAM score function change expect intervention . As intervention cohort small , use concordance parameter , rather regression model , quantify degree change hypothesize mechanisms intervention operate concordant ( individual level ) change outcomes ( cognitive ability ) .</detailed_description>
