	<brief_summary>Asthma disease represent public health problem worldwide , several barrier , especially pediatric patient disease , , prevent adequate control condition , addition every day new processing aid entity ; within novel research found relationship decrease vitamin D serum level role regulate immune response , also relationship pathophysiology disease responses event infectious disease respiratory tract exacerbate symptom pediatric patient . We clinical trial aim improve serum level vitamin D asthmatic patient , however , study different source bias thus far solid evidence favor deny relationship asthma vitamin D , paper aim help generate evidence improve clinical management patient lung function increase free time crisis . In trial two study group divide intervention describe : Group low supplementation dose : 1 tablet 400 IU administer every 24 hour via oral , regardless time food , preferably morning improve adherence treatment , complete one year treatment without suspension . Group high supplementation dose : 1 tablet 1600 IU administer every 24 hour via oral , regardless time food , preferably morning improve adherence treatment , complete one year treatment without suspension thereof .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There several potential mechanism describe vitro model vivo model link asthma control elevate level vitamin D serum . These mechanism include structural effect lung , immunomodulation , modulation smooth muscle response level effect bronchial response inhale medicine treat asthma . - Structural mechanism Studies conduct rat 50 day old , lung compliance measure decreased rat whose mother diet deprivation vitamin D compare rat whose mother receive vitamin supplementation observe . In human group , pulmonary function test age 6 carry , significant difference child mother vitamin D deficiency pregnancy child whose mother normal level pregnancy . These finding suggest strong relationship lung embryonic development serum level vitamin D therefore play key role structural development airway - Anti-inflammatory Mechanisms Within mechanism , significantly inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-A ) way inhibition MAP 38 produce monocyte . Another mechanism inhibition transcription factor ( necrosis factor kappa-beta ) . We observe decrease phosphorylation production reactive oxygen specie addition 1-25 dihydroxyvitamin D level lead less inflammatory damage respiratory epithelium . - Immunomodulation Effects occur innate immunity adaptive , innate immunity effect 1,25 hydroxyvitamin D effect reduction inflammatory cytokine decrease expression Toll-like receptor monocyte . Also active antimicrobial peptide defensin 2 4 human defensin cathecidina 18 , study low level vitamin D associate low level peptide - Effects helper T lymphocytes Molecular effect , vitamin D level associate decrease circulate IgE well decrease TH1 response therefore TH2 , however role vitamin D cell unclear , study show prevalence TH2 response patient adequate level Vitamin D , however decrease inflammatory response production cytokine IL 12 show vitamin D modulate response cause pathogenesis Asthma - Decrease early infection severity The previously mention effect adaptive innate immunity may decrease risk early respiratory tract infection , associate first year life high incidence wheezing . In Hawaiian child age 5 suffer rickets incidence respiratory tract diseases wheeze high population without vitamin D deficiency</detailed_description>
