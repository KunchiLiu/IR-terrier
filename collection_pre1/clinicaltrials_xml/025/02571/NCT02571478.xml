Therefore , investigator conduct pilot study adapt MC use military couple Air Force primary care clinic ( FWR20120054H ) . In pilot study original MC adapt military couple fit fast-paced environment primary care . Military specific content assessment tool Marriage Checkup develop . In addition , team develop pilot protocol use one member couple available come Marriage Checkup , give likelihood partner seek MC may partner currently deploy otherwise unable/unwilling participate in-person checkup .

IBHCs work primary care train offer intervention within quasi-experimental research design pre-post change evaluate within subject . To date , twenty-two couple one individual ( N = 45 ; least one partner couple active duty ) two primary care site complete MC . A multilevel model analysis indicate statistically significant pre-post change study variable two week two month , effect size moderate range . Relationship satisfaction ( B = .54 , p = .003 , B = .55 , p = .004 ) , distress ( B = .75 , p &lt; .001 , B = .58 , p = .003 ) intimacy ( B = .43 , p &lt; .017 , B = .47 , p = .014 ) significantly improve . In addition , couple complete questionnaire measure level satisfaction MC intervention . The scale range 1 ( ) 5 ( much ) , across question average response 4.33 immediately post checkup 4.05 one-month follow-up , indicate couple satisfied Marriage Checkup experience . The result pilot study provide preliminary evidence suggest MC effectively adapt military population , successfully use behavioral health consultant ( BHCs ) work integrate primary care clinic .

During screen IBHC also assess presence study exclusion factor . If conclusion first IBHC contact potential participant express interest participate meet inclusion exclusion criterion , meet Research Assistant review complete informed consent document study participation baseline questionnaire . The study use randomize two-group research design participant randomly assign sign informed consent document either receive MC right away place 7-month wait list condition . All participant complete study measure baseline , eight week ( 1 month post-treatment assign first MC condition ) 28 week ( six month post-treatment assign first MC condition ) . Participants assign 7-month wait-list condition offer MC completion 6-month follow-up measure .</detailed_description>
