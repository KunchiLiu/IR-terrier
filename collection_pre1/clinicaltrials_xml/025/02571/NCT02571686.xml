	<brief_summary>The aim project test accuracy pulse oximeter mild , moderate severe hypoxia . This do comparing read pulse oximeter brief , steady state hypoxia gold-standard measurement blood oxyhemoglobin saturation ( arterial blood sample process laboratory hemoximeter ) . The data obtain submit pulse oximeter manufacturer FDA device approval .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Accuracy Pulse Oximeters With Profound Hypoxia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Overall design : Studies normally involve 6-12 normal adult volunteer pay subject , 20-25 1-2 ml arterial blood sample subject obtain different steady-state level hypoxia 70-100 % . Blood sample obtain arterial line measure hemoximeter determine true saturation value . Some sponsor may require blood sampling . Some sponsor may require additional blood sample , 35 sample may draw . Readings test pulse oximeter record compare `` gold-standard '' blood value . The pulse oximeter probe may locate variety sit subject , include finger , toe , ear , forehead , scalp bridge nose . These detector-probes non-invasive . The level hypoxia measure controlled investigator . A computer program display prediction , breath breath , arterial oxygen saturation , ( SaO2 ) study subject . SaO2 compute end-expired Po2 Pco2 determine mass spectrometer gas analysis . This information permit inspire gas mixture air , plus CO2 nitrogen , adjust operator watch value compute expiration analog meter . This computer-estimated saturation adjust operator one 6 level predict saturation , hold stable 30 second level . Two three `` run '' conduct per subject . Each `` run '' last 8-12 min 4 5 plateau test per run . The manufacturer may choose target value . Plateaus typically seek 92 % , 86 % , 80 % , 74 % , 68 % 62 % . Other manufacturer ask equal number data point point 70 % 100 % . Some sponsor may also request additional variable measure test include high low Carbon Dioxide ( CO2 ) , subject asked hyperventilate ; low perfusion , subject ask lay flat , head ; test pulse oximeter motion , subject 's hand fix motion machine ; measure eye-tracking hypoxia . The subject 's informed study staff consent form additional procedure apply .</detailed_description>
