	<brief_summary>This study intend investigate optimum interval micro-osteoperforations accelerate orthodontic tooth movement . Overall , investigator compare rate tooth movement micro-osteoperforated site non micro-osteoperforated site . Next , investigator compare rate orthodontic tooth movement micro-osteperforation perform 4 , 8 12 week ' interval . In addition , investigator evaluate pain intensity impact pain quality life different interval micro-osteoperforations 4 , 8 12 week . Finally , investigator compare rate orthodontic tooth movement maxilla mandible . The significance outcome determine optimum recommend interval micro-osteopeforation use accelerate orthodontic tooth movement . By find optimum interval , investigator come recommend interval micro-osteoperforation use routinely patient fasten orthodontic tooth movement .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . TRIAL DESIGN This prospective randomized clinical trial single centre study ( Faculty Dentistry , University Malaya ) . Participants include molar class I malocclusion , molar Class II &amp; III &lt; ½ unit , require extraction four permanent first premolar maximum anchorage control Temporary Anchorage Device ( TAD ) . 2 . SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION Sample size calculation base type 1 error frequency 5 % power statistical test set 90 % ( P = 0.9 , B = 0.1 ) This base animal study guide detect least 50 % difference rate tooth movement . ( Teixeira CC et al.,2010 ) . The sample size calculate base formula describe Lisa Kuramoto Vancouver Coastal Health Research Institute . Total participant need 30 minimum 10 participant per group . We anticipate 20 % drop-outs base previous study . Thus , minimum 36 participant recruit . 4 . ETHICAL APPROVAL Approval conduct study obtain Medical Ethics Committee , University Malaya 5 . RANDOMIZATION This study conduct one orthodontic resident together one orthodontic Consultant Faculty Dentistry , University Malaya , main supervisor study . A simple randomization method employ assign patient experimental site also frequency interval micro-osteoperforation . 6 . INTERVENTION Sequence event clinical trial follow : - 1 . Diagnostic record taking ( Study model , Photographs , x-ray ) 2 . Randomization experimental site maxilla mandible &amp; randomization interval micro-osteoperforation ( Group 1 : 4weeks maxilla &amp; 8weeks mandible , Group 2 : 8weeks maxilla &amp; 12weeks mandible , Group 3 : 12 week maxilla &amp; 4 week mandible ) 3 . Treatment plan Orthodontic Consultant 4 . Placement TADs bilaterally maxilla mandible &amp; Clinical calibration inter-observer error 5 . Referral extraction 14,24,34 44 ( Extraction must do within 2 week insertion TADs ) 6 . One month extraction , Banding Bonding upper low preadjusted edgewise fix appliance ( MBT prescription 0.022 '' x 0.028 '' slot ) . 7 . Arch wire sequence level align follow : - - Upper low 0.014 NiTi Arch wire - Upper low 0.018 NiTi Arch wire - Upper low 17 x 25 NiTi Arch wire - Upper low 19 x 25 SS Arch wire - Dead coil place maintain extraction space premolars - Interval arch wire sequence 6 week 8 . One month insertion work arch wire , micro-osteoperforations perform &amp; Inter-obverver error measurement do 2 week insertion work arch wire day mirco-osteoperforations . 9 . Three micro-osteoperforations place buccal aspect buccal cortical bone site premolar extraction ( experimental site ) canine retract bilaterally NiTi Coil Spring . 10 . Participants give questionnaire procedure questionnaire collect follow visit 11 From onwards , participant review respective interval . Either 4,8 12 week interval . 12 . This critical period study micro-osteoperforations perform questionnaire give participant . 13 . Data collection conduct period 16weeks ( 4 month ) - canine retraction</detailed_description>
