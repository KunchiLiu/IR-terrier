	<brief_summary>The TAP space muscle layer abdominal wall house nerve supply abdominal skin . Injecting local anesthetic ropivacaine space block nerve prevent pain follow c-section . The investigator compare two different approach inject local anesthetic space . Conventionally , block do surgery complete abdomen close . The anesthesiologist introduces needle abdominal wall skin ultrasound guidance reach TAP space drug inject . Since TAP layer one deep layer abdominal ( belly ) wall closer inside abdomen outside ( skin ) , inject inner aspect abdominal wall surgery easy quicker perform conventional block require ultrasound guidance risk injury abdominal organ like liver . With research investigator attempt prove surgically administer TAP block take 25 % less time perform compare conventionally administer TAP block post cesarean section pain relief . Surgical TAP block also cost-effective addition reduce OR time , safer require skilled operator specialized equipment . Secondary outcome include total time spend Operating room , presence severity postoperative pain , time first request pain medication , total postoperative narcotic consumption 48 hour surgery side effect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparative Study Two Different Techniques Perform TAP-blocks</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator propose perform prospective randomize trial surgically administer TAP block compare conventional TAP block . The investigator recruit woman undergo scheduled cesarean delivery neuraxial anesthesia . Participants recruit labor delivery Maimonides Medical Center . Written inform consent obtain patient standardized consent form explain voluntary nature study , benefit risk procedure alternative . Sample size calculation : Estimates time take perform anesthetic block set average 10 minute standard deviation 3.75 minute ( range 5-20min ) . The number participant necessary detect 25 % reduction time take perform block power 80 % Î±=0.05 36 patient group total 72 patient . Allowing 15 % dropout rate require 42 patient recruit group total 84 patient . The investigator initially conduct pilot study first five patient . Patients undergo stratified block randomization control BMI ( BMI &lt; 40 BMI &gt; =40 ) , complexity surgery base number previous uterine scar ( &lt; = 2previous scar , 3 previous scar ) Anesthetic regimen : Cesarean section perform neuraxial anesthesia- spinal , epidural combine spinal-epidural . Standard dose local anesthetic use patient . Patients receive supplemental short act non-opioid medication ( eg : ketamine ) intraoperatively include patient convert general anesthesia exclude . TAP Block : The conventional TAP block perform skin close completion surgery dress apply . The abdomen prepped drape sterile fashion block perform sonographic guidance level umbilicus anterior axillary line . A blunt tip 21G needle use perform block 20ml 0.5 % ropivacaine inject confirm location needle sonogram . Similar procedure repeat side . The surgical TAP block perform technique adapt description DJ Owen et al ( Owen DJ , 2011 ) . After uterine closure complete good hemostasis secure , abdominal wall side away surgeon retract superiorly surgical assistant surgeon palpate lateral border rectus muscle . The block perform lateral rectus muscle order avoid injury inferior epigastric vessel . Safe access TAP plane achieve inserting blunt needle parietal peritoneum transverse abdominis muscle time appreciable loss resistance ( 'one pop ' ) . The needle local anesthetic drug use identical conventional TAP block . After careful aspiration , ensure vascular injury occur , 1 ml anesthetic solution introduce slowly . The presence substantial resistance injection bleb formation ( peritoneal site ) suggest incorrect needle tip position , result needle reposition advancement retraction require . The surgeon feel expanse plane significant volume inject little resistance . The surgical TAP block perform side similar manner except surgeon switch side assistant good visualization perform block . Following block , rectus sheath skin close usual manner . Blinding : The patient operator assess postoperative outcome measure ( pain , analgesic requirement , side effect patient satisfaction ) blind allocation . The investigator assess primary outcome ( time take perform block ) blind due nature study independent observer surgeon anesthesiologist performing procedure . The investigator two independent observer collect data time outcomes reduce error also procedure film random sample 10 % patient verify time assign study personnel . Postoperative : Each woman prescribe standard analgesic regimen toradol 30mg IV every 8 hour IV Tylenol 1000mg every 6 hour need . Morphine PCA also available pain control toradol Tylenol . The presence severity postoperative pain , sedation , nausea/vomiting , respiratory depression assess postoperatively 4 , 8 , 24 48 hour investigator blind group allocation . The time first request rescue analgesia total consumption opioid non-opioid pain medication 48 hour also record . The severity pain rest coughing assess use 10-cm visual analog scale ( 0 pain 10 bad imaginable pain ) . Presence side effect like nausea/vomiting , sedation itching record . Outcomes : The primary outcome time take perform block ( conventional TAP block surgical TAP block ) . Secondary outcome include time component ( total time spend Operating room , time uterine closure hemostasis exit OR ) postoperative outcome ( presence severity postoperative pain , time first request rescue analgesic , total consumption pain medication 48 hour surgery , sedation , postoperative nausea/vomiting , itch ) . Statistical analysis : Standard descriptive statistic use mean median use describe data depend whether assumption normality violate . For primary outcome time take perform block , student test appropriate nonparametric test compare difference two group perform . An intention treat analysis perform . All calculation do use SPSS software . Senior biostatistician Dr Peter Homel perform analysis . The study suspend Fridays , Saturdays , Sundays , observe religious holiday . Physicians nursing staff Department Anesthesiology Obstetrics blind dose ropivacaine administer collect data 4 , 8 , 24 , 48 hour cesarean section verbal interaction staff patient . The patient ' answer record data collection sheet place chart future analysis principal co-investigators , physician nursing staff affiliate Departments Anesthesiology Obstetrics . For quality control bimonthly review data collect ensure integrity completeness information collect .</detailed_description>
