	<detailed_description>The perioperative management cardiac surgery patient change dramatically last fifteen year development new cardiac output monitoring device , availability new inotropic molecule , modern treatment cardio-circulatory failure . However , study report possible change practice . The last French national survey conduct 2001 . Since , literature poor subject , impact new approach marginally address . Recently , German postal survey conduct among cardiac surgery anesthesiologist , purely declarative element without patient data . The investigator offer type national prospective observational study evaluate professional practice , morbidity mortality cardiac surgical patient . This study must include patient undergoing cardiac surgery participate center 7 week . The main objective work assess proportion patient undergoing cardiac surgery receive cardiac output monitoring . Secondary objective describe relationship use cardiac output monitoring use positive inotropic agent vasoactive ( type molecule , duration ) , volume expansion transfusion first 24 hour , incidence postoperative complication patient undergo cardiac surgery .</detailed_description>
