	<detailed_description>Sleep disturbance consistently report HIV+ individual , occur early course infection . Among disorder sleep commonly find HIV , insomnia far frequent condition , affect almost 75 % HIV-infected individual . Compared non-infected individual , HIV+ patient 17 % likely develop insomnia . Furthermore , insomnia frequent HIV ; also severe HIV+ compare HIV- individual . The precise mechanism underlie vulnerability population insomnia still remain hypothetical , might involve neurodegenerative process related infection , associate mood disorder ( e.g. , depression , anxiety ) , side effect antiretroviral medication , psychosocial factor . Importantly , sleep disorder HIV demonstrate affect severity infection . For instance , sleep disturbance show mediate association psychological distress immune status ( T-cytotoxic/suppressor cell count ) . In addition , sleep disruption also affect response treatment , illustrated report demonstrate sleep disturbance mediate association medication adherence self-reported HIV symptom severity . Finally , insomnia HIV seem closely associate presence cognitive disturbance . Indeed , virtually HIV infected individual cognitive impairment present insomnia complaint , great sleep disturbance associate worse cognitive performance ( e.g. , executive function , psychomotor speed ) population . Therefore , insomnia show affect symptom severity , treatment adherence cognition HIV+ individual . Despite demonstrated importance sleep well-being HIV patient , study sleep treatment intervention HIV . Two study implement educational intervention promote healthy sleep habit ( e.g. , healthy diet , reduce caffeine consumption , exercise bedtime , regular sleep-wake schedule ) , consist either one single session 10 weekly session , little consistent sleep improvement population . This surprising give previous study show limited efficacy intervention focus solely sleep hygiene general chronic insomnia population . The effective treatment chronic insomnia currently consist multimodal psychological intervention , call cognitive-behavioral therapy insomnia ( CBT-I ) . CBT-I improves sleep degree hypnotic medication short term , , contrast hypnotic , show side effect remain effective long term , sustain improvement sleep daytime function 2 year completion therapy . CBT-I proven effective patient primary insomnia ( i.e . without associated medical condition ) , well insomnia comorbid depression cancer . However , efficacy CBT-I study HIV+ individual insomnia . Digital Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy Insomnia ( CBT-I ) : Sleepio program CBT-I intervention aim break pattern maladaptive think behavior serve maintain insomnia . It include range technique include behavioral component ( stimulus control , sleep restriction , relaxation ) combine cognitive ( manage sleep related worry , race mind intrusive thought ) educational ( sleep hygiene ) component . CBT-I usually dispense group session , include 5 8 patient trained therapist . The different component CBT-I cover 6 8 weekly session 60-90 minute . While CBT-I demonstrate efficacious treatment option , personnel-intensive nature CBT-I constitute important barrier widespread clinical use . Web-based ( digital ) CBT-I develop overcome barrier . Two randomize control trial ( RCT ) evaluate separate digital CBT-I ( dCBT-I ) application . In first study , six-week wait-list control trial self-help dCBT-I test via simple web-based platform deliver CBT-I content . Insomnia improvement significantly well dCBT-I group compare wait-list control , 4 week follow-up . In addition , 48 week follow intervention , within-subjects improvement insomnia severity also observe . The second RCT CBT-I include six-week placebo-controlled dCBT-I intervention , use medium rich , interactive application online discussion forum user . This platform , name Sleepio ( www.sleepio.com ) , allow user receive weekly , interactive session online virtual therapist . That RCT show large effect sleep efficiency ( d=1.00 ) insomnia severity ( use Sleep Condition Indicator ( SCI ) scale , d= .77 ) , relative placebo control , 8 week follow-up . Overall 75 % patient respond intervention , defined recovery healthy sleep efficiency level . In addition , dCBT-I also significantly improve daytime function , include self-reported assessment concentration productivity , thereby suggest potential benefit CBT-I cognitive function . The current intervention sub-study test Sleepio dCBT-I intervention people HIV . Free access provide Sleepio program . The program deliver entirely online , 6 weekly session spread 6-12 week . The CBT-I session deliver animate virtual therapist , `` The Prof '' . At start therapy , participant complete short questionnaire , use suggest examples goal . Participants encourage complete daily sleep diary online throughout entire course , use provide personalized help . Indeed , interaction virtual therapist dynamically drive information daily sleep diary complete user , provide baseline , adherence , performance progress data ; sleep diary information also use tailor sleep restriction schedule function patient ' usual bedtime . Within therapy session , sleep diary data review , goal review new target set . The treatment content base CBT insomnia manual include follow technique : psycho-education , goal setting , sleep hygiene , sleep restriction , stimulus control , cognitive restructuring , paradoxical intention , mindfulness , positive imagery , relaxation ( progressive muscle relaxation &amp; autogenic training ) , put day rest , think stop . Participants encourage select appointment time Sleepio session prompt via email attend . In addition , participant receive email reminder morning prompt fill sleep diary access moderate online community online library information sleep throughout course intervention . They able view online 'case file ' include four section : progress review , reminder strategy try session , agree sleep schedule list reading . In addition Sleepio program , participant ask complete short set questionnaire assess mood , quality life , cognitive symptom sleep quality via online link prior start end program , next routine ( main study ) follow-up visit .</detailed_description>
