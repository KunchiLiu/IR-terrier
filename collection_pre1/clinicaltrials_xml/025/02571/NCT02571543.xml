	<brief_title>Can Ibuprofen Delay Ovulation Natural Cycle-IVF ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background In vitro fertilisation perform without use gonadotropin-stimulating medication , = Natural Cycle-IVF NC-IVF short . The effectivity NC-IVF limited pro treatment cycle one follicle develop , ovulate prematurely . If case , follicle aspiration longer possible next cycle must await . One possibility prevent premature ovulation prescription NSAID , common practice many centre , even though , effectivity proven . To test meaningfulness worldwide implementation NSAIDs NC-IVF , proof concept need . An exactly define study outline explore use Ibuprofen dosage 3x400mg/24h 3x800mg/24h . At low dose , Ibuprofen show increased side effect randomise placebo-controlled study . The primary purpose study therefore determine whether NSAIDs form Ibuprofen successfully delay ovulation way would useful everyday application NC-IVF . Secondary purpose measure effect Ibuprofen Prostaglandin-E2 level fluid extract follicle also whether number oocyte obtain extracted follicle differs regular IVF-treatment . The study design prospective , non-randomised , single-arm , proof-of-concept trial . The intervention study dose either 400mg Brufen® dose 800mg Brufen® ( Drug class : Ibuprofen ) , take every 8 hour ( night 12 hour ) equal daily dose 1200mg/24h 2400mg/24h . The intervention continue 42 hour , total 5 tablet . Patients recruit enter study take part duration one NC-IVF treatment cycle , roughly 2 month . Each patient take part , one treatment cycle . The study population include female age 18-42 , indication NC-IVF . They must wish treatment fulfil necessary requirement , regular menstruation every 26-32 day accessibility ovaries transvaginal follicular puncture . The study plan 25 complete cycle 25 individual patient two interim analysis allow stop trial futility potentially first 8 complete cycle ( two-stage design ) . Blinding occur , placebo non-historical test group use , thus open trial . No randomisation stratify sample occur . Patients qualify recruit NC-IVF consultation investigator ' Clinic . The total study span 5 consultation : Consult 1 : Recruitment patient , description study hand patient information inform consent documentation . Consult 2 : Day 8-14 Patients ' menstrual cycle . Collection inform consent documentation definitive enrollment study . The patient undergo sonographic examination follicle size well determination E2 LH serum level . Following consultation , patient self-inject HCG time commence study intervention 400mg Brufen® every 8 hour Consult 3 . Consult 3 : Exactly 42 hour HCG injection , patient undergo sonographic check follicle remain unovulated , retrieved via vaginal access . Along OPU , second study intervention form 5ml venous blood sample take place , order determine serum level Ibuprofen . Consult 4 : If follicle retrieve successfully fertilise , 2-3 day later transfer patient ' uterus . Consult 5 : 14-18 day embryo transfer , patient perform pregnancy test . Should 8 complete cycle dose 400mg Brufen® able show effect delay ovulation &gt; 3 8 study participant , treatment dose raise 800mg Brufen® study recommences . Justification study design : Large study include one prospective randomise study use NSAIDs versus medication perform test efficacy NSAIDs . However , study design proven useful test hypothesis NSAIDs delay ovulation . Therefore design prove hypothesis ovulation induction follow follicle aspiration late follicle definitely ovulate . If patient take Ibuprofen follicle still ovulate 42 hour ovulation induction , hypothesis confirm . Objective - Overall Objective The purpose study evaluate whether Ibuprofen delay ovulation manner use effectively patient undergo NC-IVF treatment aim describe efficacy safety profile Ibuprofen context . - Primary Objective The study seek primarily determine whether Ibuprofen delay ovulation , order reduce rate premature ovulation NC-IVF . - Secondary Objectives A secondary objective analyse Ibuprofen inhibit detachment oocyte follicular wall lead reduce oocyte yield . Methods As first study intervention patient receive 400mg Ibuprofen every 8-12 hour morning day plan follicular extraction . This equivalent 5 tablet begin time HCG injection , induce ovulation . The follicular extraction take place 36 hour usually case , 42 hour HCG injection . In case trial stop futility first 8 complete cycle , treatment dose Ibuprofen increase 800mg study recommence . Should follicle already ovulate treatment continue regular IVF therapy ( fertilisation oocyte follow embryo transfer ) . As second study intervention , patient give blood sample ( 5ml ) time follicle extraction order determine serum concentration Ibuprofen , thus prove take .</detailed_description>
