	<brief_summary>The purpose study demonstrate 7-day course systemic glucocorticoid decrease inflammatory activity moderate severe bronchiolitis paediatric patient compare standard treatment . To evaluate morbidity ( regard clinical course : Intensive Pediatric Unit Care unit ( PICU ) admission , mechanical ventilation , ionotropic support , nosocomial infection , rescue therapy respiratory failure ; duration PICU stay hospitalization ; exitus ) treatment control group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A Prospective , randomise , double blind placebo control study . Patients assign experimental group ( group 1 ) receive iv methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg/day ( two divide dos ) and/or oral prednisolone 2,5 mg/kg/day ( two divide dos ) every 12 hour , 7 day . Patients assign control group ( group 2 ) receive iv/oral glucose 5 % solution placebo , dose time experimental group . A total 50 ( initially 39 , extend 50 Protocol Amendment ) patient per group recruit . Bronchiolitis common infection lower respiratory tract . It define , first episode bronchospasm , dyspnea , expiratory difficulty , feed refusal , tachypnea great 50 rpm radiological evidence hyperinflation , less 24 month . It prevalent disease , Respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) infect 70 % child one year 100 % child 2 year generate major health impact epidemic period ( especially December February ) . It frequent cause hospitalization child one year winter 10 % admit need intensive care , 60 % require intubation mechanical ventilation . The estimated disease healthy child , mortality range 0.005 % 0.02 % , hospitalized child become 1 % 3 % . In recent year , numerous study , mainly RSV bronchiolitis , analyze immunological basis disease , discuss complex , order perform prophylaxis treatment optimal infection . Inflammatory response bronchiolitis result activation cytokine chemokines generates viral clearance . However , inflammatory response disproportionate , pathogenesis disease lead bad clinical evolution . Corticosteroids drug inhibitory effect specific immune response , mediate T cell B cell , potent inhibitor phagocyte function . These drug effective management multiple form secondary inflammatory disease immune disorder may also useful management bronchiolitis . The treatment bronchiolitis mainly base supportive therapy : oxygen therapy , proper hydration aspiration nasal secretion . Many treatment try tried lessen severity infection , use bronchodilator / corticosteroid , although controversial result . In literature review conduct PubMed , investigator find 110 related bronchiolitis , MeSH Terms , publication use word `` bronchiolitis '' [ All Fields ] AND ( `` child '' [ MeSH Terms ] . Only three article show result clinical trial , although none relation usefulness steroid bronchiolitis . There case report describe use intravenous corticosteroid infant severe bronchiolitis , combination therapy extracorporeal oxygenation . One important aspects investigator take consideration rhinovirus bronchiolitis one involve cause development asthma , one etiology bronchiolitis could benefit treatment corticosteroid . Prednisolone methylprednisolone also well know use drug , whose side effect often dose duration dependent . The identification recruitment patient take place admission Intensive Pediatric Unit Care unit Hospital Sant Joan de Deu . Treatment patient start day 0 3 hospitalization . The patient treatment duration 7 day , start follow-up phase , duration one month date baseline visit hospital discharge .</detailed_description>
