	<detailed_description>The advanced chronic lung disease ( PAD ) characterize development several structural abnormality , pulmonary systemic functional low potential reversibility , spite treatment . It define DPA whole lung non-neoplastic chronic final phase . Most people DPA consist elderly people lung function quite compromise gas exchange . These condition determine chronically limitation activity daily live , negative impact mental social state , frequent exacerbation disease numerous hospitalization , recognize risk factor increase morbidity mortality ( MACHADO , 2006 ) . Clinically , patient APD may one follow sign symptom : dyspnea ; cough ; intolerance effort ; hypoxemia / hypercapnia ; malnutrition / cachexia ; anxiety / depression ( BTS 2004 ) . According Garden 2004 , DPA affect million people worldwide estimate Brazil two million individual APD . The prevalent lung disease , final stage , fall DPA definition classify obstructive , restrictive , vascular hypoventilation syndrome . Obstructive chronic respiratory insufficiency part individual COPD , bronchiectasis bronchiolitis . Already restrictive cover patient interticiais disease neuromuscular disease . And pulmonary vascular disease fit patient primary pulmonary hypertension secondary chronic pulmonary thromboembolism ( MACHADO , 2006 ; PAUL , 2005 ) . Within restrictive disease high prevalence find interticiais disease heterogeneous disorder , group accord clinical , radiological functional similar . In group condition account majority advance pulmonary disease idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis , hypersensitivity pneumonitis sarcoidosis . The etiology unknown many situation ; know cause stand tobacco-related disease ( Guidelines interticiais lung disease , 2012 ) . Vascular disease also fit advanced lung disease present significant pulmonary systemic change patient . Before insult stimuli different nature , pulmonary vessel undergo change , know pathological remodel circulation . The vessel tougher reactive , cause pulmonary vascular disease . Morphologic lesions arterial tree lead local change pattern blood flow , flow slowly add change detect endothelial surface abnormality coagulation system proteins provide local thrombus formation . Pulmonary hypertension pathological condition present mean pulmonary artery pressure 25 mmHg ( CONSENSUS , 2009 ) . The alveolar hypoventilation major injury respiratory function obesity . The concept alveolar hypoventilation reflect incompetence respiratory system eliminate carbon dioxide proportion reach lung . Implies , therefore , presence hypercapnia ( PaCO2 &gt; 45 mm Hg ) accompany equivalent degree hypoxemia ( low PaO 2 ) . Alveolar hypoventilation syndrome-obesity define chronic alveolar hypoventilation obese patient ( body mass index great 30 kg / m2 ) , without respiratory disease justify disorder gas exchange . Palliative treatment consist control chronic hypoventilation hypoxemia resolute treatment combat obesity ( SILVA , GA 2006 ) . Among obstructive disease major relevance bronchiectasis COPD . Bronchiectasis refers dilatation bronchus irreversible distortion due destruction elastic muscle component wall . It congenital acquire . To purchase need aggression infection disability hygiene bronchial secretion . The patient cough , possibly episodes hemoptysis ( GARDEN , 2004 ) . COPD preventable treatable respiratory disease characterize presence chronic airflow obstruction fully reversible . The airflow obstruction usually progressive associate abnormal inflammatory response lung inhale particle toxic gas . Although COPD affect lung , also produce significant systemic consequence contribute disease severity ( GOLD - Global Obstructive Lung Disease , 2013 ) . The ODP consider non-pharmacological treatment critical patient chronic respiratory insufficiency . Maintaining low stable level oxygen blood great importance organic homeostasis . Oxygen supplementation improve survival patient chronic hypoxemia prescription recommend consensus subject . The main benefit oxygen body decline ventilatory work improve cardiovascular muscular function ( Machado , 2006 ) . Classical study find use ODP 15 h / day patient chronic respiratory disease increase survival patient severe hypoxemia ( Lancet , 1981 ; Ann Intern Med , 1980 ... ) . The use oxygen indicate patient ( GOLD - Global Obstructive Lung Disease , 2013 ) : - PaO2 mmHg SpO2 ≤ 55 ≤ 88 , without hypercapnia confirm two time period 3 week , - = 55 60 mmHg PaO2 SaO2 = 89 % , evidence pulmonary hypertension , polycythemia ( hematocrit &gt; 55 % ) The number patient require ODP increase every year . This type therapy use frequently order reduce morbidity mortality improve quality life patient . This practice allow optimize occupation bed , reduce length number hospitalization thus reduce hospital cost ( Tanni , S. E et al 2007 ) . Two large study evaluate benefit ODP . The first study conduct Medical Research Concil compare use oxygen 15h / X 0 h / , show improved survival patient regularly use oxygen . The second study , Nocturnal Oxygen Therapy Trial , compare use 24h / 12h / , show improved survival patient use oxygen longer ( Nocturnal Oxygen Therapy Trial Group , 1980 ) . The DPA 's important public health problem world . Many people suffer disease year die prematurely disease complication . The DPA , particularly COPD , classify major cause morbidity mortality worldwide result economic social impact substantial growing , debt major highlight medical field recent year ( Gold , 2013 ) . Thus work identify predictor mortality patient DPA ODP help professional public private policy health directly link treat patient , optimize clinical management , help improve treatment patient , increase life expectancy , reduce cost improve quality life patient .</detailed_description>
