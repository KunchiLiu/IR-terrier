	<brief_title>The Cardio-Oncology Breast Cancer Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale study : Breast cancer common cancer among Swedish woman , account third cancer case among female . The breast cancer incidence increase 2596 8000 breast cancer diagnosis 2011 . During past 40 year , age-adjusted incidence double . Early adjuvant therapy reduces risk die 50 % . ( Early adjuvant therapy ; chemotherapy , antibody , endocrine therapy , radiotherapy ) . Treatment advance improve survival rate , treatment-related cardiotoxicity ( CT ) remain substantial problem . In general , earlier treatment cardiotoxicity offer best chance prevent ameliorate clinical cardiotoxicity . Risk factor modify reduced treating elevate blood pressure , normalize lipid , encourage weight reduction smoke cessation . Patient-tailored therapy possible , especially give availability different chemotherapy regimen , safe anthracycline analog liposomal doxorubicin , cardioprotective medication angiotensin convert enzyme ( ACE ) -inhibitors , angiotensin receptor blocker , b-blockers . It suggest new cardiac biomarkers ultrasound technique detect cardiotoxicity early , subclinical , stage . The investigator hypothesize biomarkers use detect subclinical cardiotoxicity detect early sign cardiotoxicity might reduce number , time-to-onset , severity cardiotoxic event . In present proposal investigator aim randomize study compare primary cardiac preventive measurement versus standard care . Objectives trial : 1 . Primary objective In randomized study investigate cumulative incidence cardiotoxic event , per randomize arm , start chemotherapy , treatment 1 , 5 , 10 year completion chemotherapy . 2 . Secondary Objectives To compare number , time-to-onset , severity cardiotoxic event experimental group assess treated subclinical cardiotoxicity start chemotherapy , treatment 1 , 5 , 10 year completion chemotherapy control group receive standard care without early assessment subclinical cardiotoxicity . Data variable collect group start chemotherapy , treatment 1 , 5 , 10 year . Data experimental group use real time guide therapy , data control group analyze end study . To assess subclinical cardiotoxicity serum concentration biomarkers , tissue Doppler strain echocardiography , electrocardiography , magnetic resonance imaging , well standard cardiac risk assessment base standard risk factor : history heart disease , increase age , obesity , hypertension , diabetes mellitus , hypercholesterolemia , smoking , parasternal radiotherapy , cumulative dose anthracyclines trastuzumab . To assess association primary treatment exist standard cardiac risk factor , biomarkers parameter echocardiography , electrocardiography , cardiac magnetic resonance imaging , ( predictor ) subsequent occurrence clinical subclinical cardiotoxicity cardiotoxicity ( outcome ) within between-groups , time . To examine diagnosis breast cancer development cardiotoxicity influence woman 's quality life .</detailed_description>
