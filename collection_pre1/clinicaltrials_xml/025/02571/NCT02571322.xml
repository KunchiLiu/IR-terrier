	<detailed_description>The purpose study determine effect whole-body vibration ( WBV ) body composition , physical fitness , quality life.Twenty healthy adult male female ( age 18-65 ) contraindication exercise training recruit participate study . Subjects participate randomize , crossover trial 24 week . Subjects assign either : ( 1 ) WBV first 12 week aerobic exercise training second 12 week 3 time per week ( n=10 ) ( 2 ) aerobic exercise training first 12 week WBV second 12 week 3 time per week ( n=10 ) . Subjects assess baseline 12 24 week aerobic capacity ( estimate VO2max ) , upper low body strength ( 1-repetition maximum bench press leg press , respectively ) , compartmental total body fat mass , fat free mass , bone mineral density ( use dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA ) ) , body mass index ( height relative weight ) , weight , skin fold body part circumference , rest blood pressure pulse , subjective health-related quality life ( SF-36 ) . Participants train assessed University Miami Miller School Medicine UHealth Fitness Wellness Center , UHealth Champions Executive Medicine , Department Psychiatry Behavioral Sciences . No substantial psychological , medical , social risk exist participant . Although measure protect confidentiality put place , possibility exist electronic data could jeopardize . In remote case event occur , immediately report Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) . Exercise show safe among every population , include chronic disease and/or complication . A DEXA scan equivalent 4 extra day ' worth naturally-occurring radiation . The use HyperVibe WBV training device harmless without know negative effect , WBV even low risk aerobic exercise , participant simply stand platform without move expose full-body vibration . The system completely non-invasive , serious , untoward side effect report manufacturer ( HyperVibe ) system . All study personnel follow instruction operate system . Participants incur additional appreciable psychological social risk participate study . The result obtain study may demonstrate way increase exercise efficiency use WBV help overweight/obese participant lose weight , gain muscular weight , improve physical fitness level . By participate study , subject may improve overall health status unique approach exercise training . The minimal risk participate study reasonable potential information gain worthwhile help people lose weight , significant , give inordinate prevalence overweight/obesity co morbid chronic disease United States today .</detailed_description>
