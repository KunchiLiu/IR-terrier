	<brief_summary>The standard treatment advance hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) sorafenib . Though agent show clear survival benefit two randomized phase III trial , benefit modest response rate percent . Therefore , loco-regional modality , like trans-arterial chemo-embolization ( TACE ) , hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy ( HAIC ) , radiotherapy ( RT ) continuously try , especially locally advanced HCC include portal vein tumor thrombosis ( PVTT ) . With advancement conformal RT technique , RT actively apply HCC , especially PVTT combine HCC . Many researcher report relationship RT dose tumor response rate . RT dose , however , frequently limited complication ( like radiation induce liver disease ( RILD ) , radiation induce gastro-duodenal toxicity , etc . ) also closely related high expose RT dose . Proton beam characteristic depth-dose distribution contrast photon , `` Bragg peak '' . The advantage dose distribution could highlight HCC management , weakness maintenance importance liver function HCC patient . In fact , superior result proton beam therapy HCC constantly report several group prospectively well retrospectively . In background , investigator plan present study evaluate efficacy safety proton beam therapy HCC patient combine PVTT .</brief_summary>
