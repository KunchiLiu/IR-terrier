	<brief_summary>Sickle cell disease ( SCD ) frequent inherit disease world . Literature report SCD patient display intolerance exercise , important muscle weakness profound remodel skeletal muscle include amyotrophy rarefy microvascular network . Because strenuous exercise induces acidosis , hemorheological alteration , endothelial activation oxidative stress , constitute potential trigger factor sickling vaso-occlusive crisis . As consequence , physical activity usually discourage patient SCD . However , moderate regular physical activity seem safe also beneficial SCD patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Training Program Homozygous Sickle Cell Disease Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Besides , endurance training know induce moderate muscle hypertrophy increase microvascular network . Therefore , adapt , moderate regular physical activity appear potential strategy able improve muscle function , decrease symptom disease improve autonomy quality life patient SCD . However , remain necessary define modality exercise therapy SCD objectively evaluate risk , limitation gain physical ability , muscle function quality life patient SCD .</detailed_description>
