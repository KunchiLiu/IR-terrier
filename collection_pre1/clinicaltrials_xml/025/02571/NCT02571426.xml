	<detailed_description>Prior study investigator research group show water sodium retention experimental animal undergo sevoflurane anesthesia . Preliminary data suggest obvious propofol anesthesia . The investigator aim study difference present child . Subjects collect ordinary routine operation hypospadia . By routine , boys undergo surgery get sacral blockade urine catheter . The child randomize either sevoflurane propofol anesthesia . Before immediately induction anesthesia baseline blood sample collect analysis sodium , potassium , creatinine , osmolality , angiotensin II , arginine-vasopressin aldosterone . Perioperative fluid start , balance glucose infusion 132mmol sodium content , cover basal fluid need + 20 % . This infusion continue end protocol ward . At induction anesthesia investigator start measure urine output every 20th minute . The blood sample collect mid-operation . At end anesthesia investigator collect urine send sample urine analysis sodium , potassium , osmolality creatinine . In postoperative ward investigator start collect urine every 20 minute 120 minute . All urine 120 minute collect , sample send analysis . After 60 minute postoperative ward , blood sample collect analysis . In childrens ward protocol postoperative ward repeat , urine collection sample , well blood sample . After 120 minute protocol end .</detailed_description>
