We propose pilot study ass feasibility , acceptability preliminary efficacy two intervention target sedentary behavior . Since currently unknown component sedentary behavior exposure present great risk health , propose separate intervention reduce overall sedentary time promote break sedentary time .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary aim : To determine acceptability feasibility select personal , social environmental strategy reduce overall sitting time increase number time participant stand day . Secondary aim : To assess whether exist new measurement approach detect specific change sedentary behavior . Exploratory aim : To establish whether specified intervention strategy efficacious reduce sedentary behavior whether intervention effect specific target sedentary behavior construct ( e.g . decrease overall sitting time increase number break sit ) .</detailed_description>
