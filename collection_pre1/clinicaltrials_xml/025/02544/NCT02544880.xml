	<brief_title>PDE5 Inhibition Via Tadalafil Enhance Anti-Tumor Mucin 1 ( MUC1 ) Vaccine Efficacy Patients With HNSCC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator perform phase I/II placebo-controlled clinical trial patient HNSCC whose tumor recur , secondary primary tumor detect , post conventional radiotherapy without prior surgery chemotherapy . For patient , salvage surgery standard curative therapeutic option , post-surgical recurrence rate high , life expectancy poor . Patients give Tadalafil ( Placebo ) combination vaccination ( anti-MUC1 + anti-Influenza vaccine placebo ) prior surgery , 3 additional course surgery combination anti-MUC1/anti-Influenza vaccine ( placebo vaccine ) . A final booster vaccination ( anti-MUC1/anti-Influenza vaccine placebo vaccine alone ) administer approximately one-year post salvage surgery . Response treatment include antigen-specific immune response characterization leukocytes subset . As secondary endpoint , tumor recurrence 2 year evaluate determine whether trend toward beneficial prognosis might observe treated patient . Eligible patient unwilling receive study treatment undergo standard curative resection consent follow recurrence-free survival ( RFS ) and/or donate specimen correlative research study ( blood and/or tumor ) also include analysis additional non-randomized control group . These analysis may include blood test obtain non-control patient specify study interval DTH test non-control patient specify interval . Control group patient may elect undergo blood test DTH test specified time interval discretion continue follow recurrence free survival .</detailed_description>
