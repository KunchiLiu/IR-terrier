	<brief_summary>Post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) common debilitate disorder affect many individual expose aversive event . The severity PTSD symptom positively correlate amygdala activation . More severe PTSD symptom follow exposure stressful event , associate amygdala hyper-responsivity prior exposure . A possible intervention PTSD Neurofeedback ( NF ) - treatment method base learn self-modulation neural activity response feedback neural signal . Previous work lab establish NF train procedure utilizes temporal ability EEG spatial advantage fMRI . Further work base method use amygdala BOLD signal ( EEG-finger-print , EFP ) demonstrate potential improving ability self-regulate amygdala activity improve emotional regulation healthy population . The current study aim investigate potential method therapeutic intervention PTSD .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neurofeedback Therapeutic Intervention For Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Patients Compared To Treatment As Usual</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pre-treatment phase ( one week ) Day 1 Participants arrive Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center ( TASMC ) receive explanation regard study protocol sign inform consent . They ask fill demographic psychological questionnaire assess emotion regulation ability ( ERQ ) , state trait anxiety ( STAI ) , questionnaires measure symptom stress , anxiety depression BDI . They also interview use clinically structure interview ( SCID , CAPS ) . All participant undergo psychiatric evaluation trauma clinic TASMC . The evaluation would also entail medication monitoring . The participant would randomize three group NF-T group ( N=20 ) , NF-N group ( N=20 ) treatment usual ( N=20 ) , base : age ( under/over 40 ) time since traumatic event ( 5 year ) . Day 2 All participant undergo brain-imaging scan characterize brain network response associate emotional arousal regulation . Participants scan functional structural MRI , include ROI localizer neurofeedback ( NF ) , rest state diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) . Following participant NF treatment group 1 session real-time-functional MRI-electric fingerprint neurofeedback ( rt-fMRI-EFP NF ) session . Prior session research staff member explain course MRI test participant , enter participant mock simulator verify lie back properly feel comfortable . During scan patient present visual auditory stimulus , well short video clip . Auditory presentation : stimuli heard via MRI -compatible headphone . Visual display : participant view stimuli mirror project onto screen magnet room . In blocks participant give time rest . Participants ask avoid move much possible scan . The total duration testing , participant arrival departure , take approximately 90-180 minute ( 20-30 minute fill form undergo training , 30 minute explanation break , 60 minute image ) . Participants remain MRI 60 minute , circumstance remain longer 90 minute . Treatment phase ( 12 week ) The duration treatment phase 12 week . All group receive 1/2 session per week . Treatment usual session : Participants obtain regular treatment regimen ( pharmacological and/or psychological ) meet psychologist/psychiatrist follow common practice clinic . NF-EFP session : For duration NF-EFP session participant seat comfortably front computer screen . A staff member explain goal meeting participant , present equipment use describe course meeting . Following explanation , staff member place EEG cap participant head ensure he/she feel comfortable . The EEG-NF practice consist five-minute segment repeat 30 minute . During practice segment participant ask modify visual auditory medium provide feedback degree successful brain training . For example , visual feedback participant ask slow speed skateboard present computer screen alternatively , via auditory feedback , reduce intensity auditory stimulus audible headphone . The duration one session approximately 45 minute . NF-EFP session NF-N group : The participant receive one two session per week describe . All training session hold neutral , non trauma-related , context . NF-EFP session NF-T group : The use trauma-related context group do gradually ensure participant gain control feedback training . In first phase include 6 12 session , participant train NF session identical NF-N group . Participants succeed lower EFP signal training ( compare baseline ) 4 6 session , last 3 5 session , qualify continue next phase training . In second phase , participant succeed describe , train context traumatic story . In first session , participant listen record trauma , accompany one team member relevant training , immediately train emotional regulation use NF neutral context . Participants succeed regulation EFP signal least one session continue next trauma-context session . In session , feedback indicate EFP signal would volume trauma-recording . That , successful reduction EFP signal would reduce volume trauma record . Participants n't succeed regulate EFP signal ( neutral context ) immediately listen trauma-recording try follow NF-N session . Midpoint assessment ( one week ) All participant receive second psychological evaluation ( plus medication monitoring ) , complete questionnaire describe pre treatment phase . Post treatment phase ( one week ) Day 1 All participant undergo final psychiatric evaluation , medication monitoring . Day 2 All participant scan functional structural MRI include rest state DTI NF session . They complete questionnaire pre treatment phase .</detailed_description>
