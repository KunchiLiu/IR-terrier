	<brief_title>NM-IL-12 ( rHuIL‐12 ) In Relapsed/Refractory Diffuse Large B- Cell Lymphoma ( DLBCL ) Undergoing Salvage Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-arm , open-label , non-randomized , multi-center study NM-IL-12 dose combination salvage chemotherapy regimen ( R-ICE = rituximab plus ifosfamide-carboplatin-etoposide , R-DHAP = rituximab plus cytosine arabinoside-cisplatin-dexamethasone ) treatment patient relapsed/refractory DLBCL . NM-IL-12 ( 150 ng/kg ) administer subcutaneously . Patients monitor routinely practice ; addition , approximately 1 day NM-IL-12 injection , patient home visit nurse blood sample related pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic ( PK/PD ) evaluation . Twelve patient plan enrolled study ; initially 6 patient enrol . The decision continue recruit remain six patient make Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) review relevant safety data , clinical laboratory evaluation , vital sign collect 21 day post enrollment last patient first treat group . Common Terminology Grades Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) guideline use determine dose-modifying criterion ( DMC ) .</detailed_description>

Male subject must willing use appropriate method contraception ( e.g. , condom ) abstain sexual intercourse inform sexual partner must also use reliable method contraception ( e.g. , birth control pill ) study 11 . Willingness ability comply schedule visit , treatment plan , laboratory test study procedure 12 . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document 1 . Uncontrolled infection require parenteral antibiotic , antiviral , antifungal within one week prior first dose first cycle chemotherapy regimen . Infections control concurrent antimicrobial agent acceptable , antimicrobial prophylaxis per institutional guideline acceptable . Patient need clinically stable define afebrile hemodynamically stable 2448 hour prior study enrollment 2 . Known active hepatitis B C infection , know human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection know positive HCV RNA HBsAg ( HBV surface antigen ) 3 . History active central nervous system ( CNS ) involvement lymphoma 4 . Prior concomitant malignancy past 5 year currently active likely interfere patient 's treatment DLBCL likely increase patient 's morbidity mortality 5 . Concomitant illness associate likely survival &lt; 1 year 6 . Any lifethreatening illness , medical condition organ system dysfunction , investigator 's opinion , could compromise patient 's safety , put study outcome undue risk 7 . Prior chemotherapy radiation therapy ( unless relate NHL / DLBCL treatment ) within last 5 year 8 . Cytotoxic drug therapy within 21 day prior enrollment 9 .
