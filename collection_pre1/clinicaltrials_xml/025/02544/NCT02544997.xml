	<brief_summary>Metastatic breast cancer ( MBC ) incurable disease need improve effective therapeutic strategy include targeted agent . Poziotinib panHER tyrosin kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) show stable activity feasible toxicity MBC patient salvage treatment strategy failure anthracycline taxane phase I trial . Poziotinib rational benefit compare salvage agent , especially patient HER2 overexpression breast cancer . Additionally , recent report show possible rational background patient HER2 mutation-positive breast cancer . Based rationale , investigator conduct phase II single-arm study poziotinib patient MBC show refractoriness conventional treatment salvage treatment .</brief_summary>
