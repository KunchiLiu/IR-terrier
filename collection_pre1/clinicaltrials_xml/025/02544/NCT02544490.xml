	<brief_summary>The objective : 1. derive validate panel miRNAs consistently differentially express plasma patient without sepsis 2. investigate prognostic predictive value panel miRNAs guide treatment 3. investigate role differentially-expressed circulate miRNAs immune modulation sepsis The methodology involve sample blood control subject sepsis continuum early presentation emergency department longitudinally hospitalization . The investigator develop panel miRNAs specific early late stage sepsis , correlate clinical , biochemical microbiological outcome miRNAs .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Prospective observational cohort patient along entire sepsis continuum National University Hospital Emergency Department ( ED ) enrol along non-infective control . Whole blood sample separate immediately plasma serum storage Tissue Repository . Those subsequently admit general ward , high dependency ( HD ) intensive care unit ( ICU ) 2nd 3rd sample obtain 24-48 hour 48-72 hour respectively . The 2nd 3rd sample use prognostic marker ( Objective # 2 ) . Patients discharge directly ED track clinical recurrence disease within 28 day ensure diagnostic accuracy first sample biomarkers extract . Samples batch-processed via circulate miRNA profile workflow comprise pre-analytics , analytics , data processing analysis phase . This qPCR-based miRNA profile much small feature sample ratio thus allow global sequential forward selection optimally combine host feature complementary prediction strength form biomarker panel least number component maximize classification power ( ROC AUC ) . Panel robustness measurement use computational generated noise validation large set blind sample perform . The final objective assess measure concentration secrete cytokine , chemokines reactive oxygen specie synthesis transfection newly-derived miRNA panel monocytes monocytic cell line .</detailed_description>
