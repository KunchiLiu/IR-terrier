	<brief_summary>Background : People neurofibromatosis 1 ( NF1 ) plexiform neurofibroma ( PNs ) pain affect daily life . This study aim improve questionnaire measure pain , daily living , physical functioning . Objectives : To examine improve questionnaire daily live people NF1 PNs . Eligibility : People age 5 old NF1 PN Design : Participants screen medical history . This study 2 phase . Phase 1 participant talk exist pain assessment questionnaires PNs affect life . They group discussion 8 people similar age NF1 PNs , parent child . These last 90 minute . Children age 5 7 parent one-on-one meeting instead . These last 45 minute . Discussions audiotaped . After questionnaire change , individual interview discuss new wording , instruction , question , electronic format new form . Phase 1 participant may invite Phase 2 . Phase 2 participant complete new questionnaire . These may pen-and-paper electronic . The questionnaire take 30 minute adult teen . Children work one-on-one staff member may need 45 minute . A small group participant complete form twice clinic 1 month later home . Also , small group start new pain treatment dose increase treatment complete form twice treatment change 1 month later .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Development Validation Patient Reported Outcome ( PRO ) Measures Individuals With Neurofibromatosis 1 ( NF1 ) Plexiform Neurofibromas ( PNs )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Neurofibromatosis 1 ( NF1 ) genetic disease multiple clinical manifestation , include plexiform neurofibroma ( PN ) cause pain may significantly impact daily function quality life ( QOL ) . - Patient-reported outcome ( PROs ) useful trial condition disable chronic like NF1 , symptom reduction improve functioning QOL currently important treatment outcome , may occur PN shrinkage . - A critical step toward approval drug treat PNs evaluate clinical benefit conjunction reduction tumor volume assess imaging endpoint . - The FDA request use PROs NF1 clinical atrials , especially assess change symptom , pain . - Currently , valid PRO measure exist specific NF1 population ass PN pain , functional impact individual life , overall physical functioning , may affect PNs . Objectives : - Phase 1 : Qualitative Evaluation -- Primary Objective : - To evaluate current modification need additional modification exist measure pain intensity ( Numeric Rating Scale ; NRS-11 ) pain interference ( Pain Interference Index ; PII ) select appropriate item measure physical functioning ( PROMIS Physical Functioning ; PROMIS-PF ) NF1 base qualitative feedback patient NF1 , PNs pain use endpoint clinical trial individual NF1 PNs . -- Secondary Objective : - Convert measure ( include change ) electronic format . - Phase 2 : Evaluation Psychometric Properties Collection Normative Data - Primary Objective : -- -To evaluate final version NRS-11 , PII , PROMIS-PF measure reliability , validity , sensitivity change , feasibility individual NF1 PNs . - Secondary Objectives : - To provide normative data measure pain intensity , pain interference , physical functioning individual NF1 PNs . - To assess psychometric property provide normative data Adult version Impact Pediatric Illness ( IPI ) Scale . Eligibility : Patients document NF1 either NIH clinical criterion molecularly-proven mutation NF1 gene include study . Patients must least 1 plexiform neurofibroma ( PN ) least &gt; 3cm physical exam &gt; 3mL volumetric MRI . Patients must least 5 year age able understand speak English . Design : This protocol limit site , multi-institutional research study maximize ability assess large , diverse sample individual NF1 . NCI lead institution three participate site Children National Medical Center , University Chicago , Cincinnati Children Hospital . This study consist 2 phase : - Phase 1 : Qualitative Evaluation -- The first phase involve evaluation current modification need additional modification NRS-11 PII evaluate appropriate item PROMIS-PF item bank use PROMIS-PF short form conduct focus group interview patient diagnose NF1 PNs parent child . We conduct 24 focus group across various age band . We conduct four group 6-8 subject age band ( 8-11 year ; 12-14 year ; 15-19 year [ still high school ] ; 18- 24 year [ graduate high school ] ; 25+ year ; parent child NF1 ) . In lieu focus group young child ( age 5-7 ) , conduct individual cognitive interview . We conduct 6 interview child age 5 , 6 , 7 , result 18 child cognitive interview ; additionally conduct 6 cognitive interview parent child 5-7 . This qualitative data evaluate necessary change base patient response , make NRS-11 , PII , PROMIS-PF . The measure convert electronic format look like paper version administer electronic tablet . We conduct 18 cognitive interview across age group evaluate measure . Based qualitative result version update necessary prepare phase 2 . - Phase 2 : Evaluation Psychometric Properties Collection Normative Data - The second phase evaluate final electronic version NRS-11 , PII , PROMIS-PF use cross-sectional design examine internal consistency , construct validity , sensitivity change , provide normative data study measure NF1 population . It goal recruit 10 patient per age band approximate total 110 patient 70 parent child adolescent patient . In addition , two subset patient receive measure two different time examine test-retest reliability sensitivity change .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Documented NF1 either NIH clinical criterion molecularlyproven mutation NF1 gene AND Greater equal 1 plexiform neurofibroma location either symptomatic asymptomatic , define follow : 1. neurofibroma grow along length nerve may involve multiple fascicle branch OR spinal neurofibroma involve two level connection level extend laterally along nerve OR skin thickness neurofibroma ; 2. measure great equal 3cm long diameter visual exam , palpation 2D MR imaging OR great equal 3mL volumetric MR imaging . Age great equal 5 year . Ability subject Legally Authorized Representative ( LAR ) understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Participants must able understand speak English language . For phase 1 focus group , patient need report experience PN related pain recently minimum pain level 3 current NRS11 report take prescription medication reduces pain experience PN related pain recently minimum pain level 1 current NRS11 . For phase 2 , testretest sensitivity change subgroup , participant need access computer , tablet , smart phone email able complete followup questionnaire . For phase 2 , participant group evaluate sensitivity change need start new pain medication regimen increase dose exist pain medication . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients severe cognitive behavior impairment , judgment investigator , would able cooperate study procedure exclude . For phase 2 , patient participate testretest subgroup enrol clinical trial start new pain treatment regimen appointment ( e.g. , medication , therapy , physical therapy , etc . )</criteria>
