	<brief_summary>Meal composition important blood sugar level patient diabetes . The aim study investigate meal composition fat , protein carbohydrate important hormonal inflammatory response Patients type 1 type 2 diabetes healthy control include study . At four different occasion participant receive lunch amount calorie different composition fat , protein , carbohydrate fiber . Blood sample take meal . The participant estimate satiety . In addition participant fill questionnaires food habit wellbeing . This study first study compare hormonal inflammatory response , well psychological aspect meal , meal different composition . Results study help make recommendation meal composition beneficial patient diabetes type 1 type 2 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Food important part human be life . During part human being history shortage food problem . Today shortage food unknown phenomena industrial country . Instead human face challenge obesity epidemic . The number obese person increase since 1980 industrial country . Today 20 - 25 % population US normal body mass index ( BMI ) . The population Europe Asia follow trend . It know increased waist ( woman &gt; 80 cm men &gt; 94 cm ) correlate insulin resistance , especially liver increase hepatic fat storage . Increased prevalence obese person follow increased prevalence patient impair glucose tolerance increase risk diabetes type 2 , cardiovascular disease cancer . It known impair glucose tolerance diabetes type 2 prevent efficiently weight loss , reduce total intake fat carbohydrate , increase intake fiber physical activity . Three popular diet , 1 ) low fat , 2 ) low carbohydrate ( high-protein high-fat ) 3 ) low glycemic load , recently receive much attention . Long term study different diet show inconsistent result . There discussion today well metabolic control achieve low-carbohydrate diet compare low-fat diet patient diabetes type 2 compare diet recommend Swedish National Food Administration . In regard dietary composition , hyperglycemia dyslipidemia determine amount quality ingest carbohydrate dietary fat . It suggest postprandial hyperglycemia hypertriglyceridemia trigger oxidative stress cause inflammation , metabolic alteration associate endothelial dysfunction . An important aspect satisfaction meal feel satiety . Subjective feeling hunger also obviously related initiation food behavior intake snack . Neophobia , fear new unfamiliar food , also related success failure food related behavior change . These feeling satiety turn relate factor blood glucose level . Thus effect ingested macronutrients postprandial glycemic response one potential mechanism food may affect satiety . Compared fat proteins , dietary carbohydrate may greatest effect postprandial glycemia insulinemia , may therefore elicit great appetitive rating several hour consumption compare lower-glycemic meal . Lately neuroendocrine hormone ( ghrelin , resistin etc ) adipokines ( leptin adiponectin ) receive attention regulator satiety plausible cause obesity . The effect high-fat , high-protein low-carbohydrate meal hormone know . The adverse effect factor chronic stress depression general health document many decade . Apart influence specific health behavior , interact influence general life stress appear relate directly alteration pro-inflammatory hemostasis process . The physiological pathway psychosocial factor might exert positive negative effect health numerous incompletely understood . However , examples particular interest finding suggest even relatively healthy person , chronic negative appraisal minor life event ( hassle ) associate increase circulating level inflammatory factor , whereas persistent positive appraisal minor life event ( uplift ) associate decreased level factor . It thus important consider general Quality Life , well food-related quality life together health taste attitude nutritional knowledge . Finally gender aspect also importance . Previously presumed inflammatory hormonal response different diet men woman . There known biological hormonal difference men woman . One may question woman get heart infarction later life compare men risk factor include inflammatory response , cholesterol level hormonal change different diet men woman . The aim study compare high-fat , high-protein low-carbohydrate meal regard post prandial glucose triglyceride concentration blood well fast inflammatory response , oxidative stress appetite regulate hormone healthy subject patient diabetes . Gender difference investigate . In general study provide information meal composition beneficial patient diabetes healthy subject . Another aim study investigate psychosocial aspect meal health locus control , neophobia , satiety food relate Quality Life important hormonal response meal . Hypothesis : 1 . Meal high concentration fiber ( 15 g ) beneficial metabolic control patient diabetes . 2 . Low-carbohydrate meal beneficial metabolic control patient diabetes . 3 . High-fat meal result hyperlipidemia worsen hepatic insulin sensitivity increase oxidative stress . 4 . High-protein high-fat meal give early satiety lower blood sugar level compare high carbohydrate diet . 5 . The perception meal affect metabolic control . Design : 30 patient type 1 ( T1DM ) 30 patient type 2 diabetes ( T2DM ) 30 healthy Controls ( HC ) include study . At four different occasion participant eat lunch different composition fat , protein , carbohydrate fiber . All group divide subgroup men woman . Healthy subject receive oral glucose tolerance test include study . The composition meal : Low-fat / high-carbohydrate meal ( 18 Eenergi % ( E % ) proteins , 28 E % fat 54 % carbohydrate ) , high-fat meal ( 18 E % protein , 50 E % fat 31 E % carbohydrate ) , high-protein meal ( 40 E % protein , 30 E % fat 30 E % carbohydrate ) low-fat / high-carbohydrate high fiber ( 18 E % protein , 28 E % fat 54 % carbohydrates 15 gram fiber ) . Before study last meal measure waist/hip ratio , BMI body composition ( Bioimpedance ) . Before study participant document daily meal three day . Patients diabetes time also document blood sugar level ( 7 time per day , fasting level , level 2 hour lunch dinner go sleep ) . Before occasion patient measure blood sugar level one day ( 7 time ) . The participant eat standardize breakfast home morning participate study . They eat one follow meal lunch 11:30 : low-fat high-carbohydrate diet recommend Swedish National Food Administration , high-protein meal , high-fat meal low-fat high-carbohydrate diet 15 g fiber . At occasion blood sample take 30 minute 5 minute lunch 30-minute interval follow four hour lunch . The blood sample analyse hormone regulate blood sugar level , appetite regulate hormone , marker oxidative stress marker inflammation endothelia dysfunction . We previously show insulin sensitivity liver estimate measure Insulin like Growh factor- I ( IGF-I ) Insulin like Growth Factor Binding Protein-1 ( IGFBP-1 ) . These hormone analyze blood sample . The participant estimate satiety desire eat parallel time blood sample withdraw . At occasion participant fill form general perception food estimate health . In case participant follow throughout whole study result analyze used group wise comparison .</detailed_description>
