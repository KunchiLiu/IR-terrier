	<brief_summary>In prospective trial , Stage 1-3 patient mastectomy isolate lumpectomy axillary node dissection randomly assign general anesthesia opioids combine Pecs II block general anesthesia opioids combine placebo Pecs II block . Participants follow postoperatively entire hospital stay determine effectiveness Pecs II block opioids versus placebo Pecs II block opioids postoperative pain treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Large-scale Prospective Double-blind Randomized Controlled Trial Pecs II Block Breast Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Each year , 9400 new case breast cancer diagnose Belgium . It make breast cancer common cancer woman , good one third cancer case woman . Surgical excision tumour necessary effective step cure disease . Recent study demonstrate positive effect regional anesthesia peroperative postoperative pain . Paravertebral block become popular alternative analgesia provide 'gold standard ' thoracic epidural analgesia . However , regional technique complication slow learn curve make unsuitable large proportion breast surgery patient treat day-stay basis . Recently , Rafael Blanco introduce Pecs Pecs II block , practical alternative paravertebral epidural blockade management pain breast surgery . The investigator introduce Pecs II block clinical practice . This study compare general anesthesia Pecs II block general anesthesia placebo Pecs II block breast surgery . The objective evaluate analgesic effectiveness change opioid consumption apply Pecs II block versus placebo Pecs II block . Stage 1-3 patient mastectomy tumourectomies axillary clearance randomly assign general anesthesia Pecs II block general anesthesia placebo Pecs II block . Enrolling 140 patient anticipated time frame 2 year provide 90 % power p-value 0.05 perioperative postoperative opioid consumption well pain score ( NRS ) . Confirming hypothesis indicate minor modification anesthetic procedure reduce opioid consumption ( include 's unwanted side effect ) surgery maintain reduce patient ' indicated pain score ( NRS ) .</detailed_description>
