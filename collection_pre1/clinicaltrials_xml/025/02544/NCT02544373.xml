	<detailed_description>Up 70 % patient MS suffer cognitive dysfunction ( difficulty think , information processing , verbal expression , memory ) . Cognitive dysfunction one disabling symptom MS , profoundly affect job performance , family responsibility , quality life . While treatment show improve cognitive dysfunction MS , many patient evaluate treated common health problem could contribute cognitive dysfunction . Up 50 % MS patient also suffer obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) . Obstructive sleep apnea common disorder upper airway collapse sleep , cause poor sleep quality decrease oxygen level blood . In patient without MS , OSA well-established cause poor cognitive performance . Recent study non-MS patient also suggest cognitive performance may improve OSA treatment . Yet , despite high number MS patient OSA , relationship OSA cognitive performance , effect OSA treatment cognitive performance MS , receive sufficient study . The objective study determine effect obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) cognitive function patient multiple sclerosis ( MS ) ; evaluate whether OSA treatment positive airway pressure therapy could improve cognitive dysfunction MS patient also OSA . Interested participant MS screen positive commonly use screen tool use detect high risk OSA invite participate . Consenting participant baseline cognitive ( memory thinking ) test ass cognitive function , overnight sleep study ( polysomnogram , PSG ) determine obstructive sleep apnea . If sleep study show sign sleep apnea , participant assign treatment sleep apnea positive airway pressure ( PAP ) therapy , either immediately ( Group 1 ) , 3 month baseline sleep study ( Group 2 ) . Groups assign random ( like flip coin ) . There 2/3 chance participant assign Group 1 . PAP therapy consider standard clinical care OSA . It involve wear apparatus include hose mask ( cover nose , nose mouth ) , connect small machine blow air airway sleep . In order determine airway pressure effectively treat individual 's sleep apnea , type mask need , separate sleep study know overnight `` PAP titration study '' also perform . This study similar PSG also involve fit various mask hook individual PAP machine test effectiveness various PAP setting , determine mask tolerable individual . Participants also receive repeat cognitive test 3 month see immediate sleep apnea treatment group ( Group 1 ) show improvement memory thinking , compare standard care treatment group ( Group 2 ) , start apnea treatment repeat cognitive test . Participants compensate travel time throughout course study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Age 1870 year screen ; 2 . Diagnosis clinically definite MS , per 2010 McDonald criterion ; 3 . Willingness undergo polysomnography ( PSG ) positive airway pressure ( PAP ) titration ( need ) ; 4 . Willingness undergo 2 separate 90minute cognitive testing session ; 5 . Either one following : Score &gt; =2 `` STOPBang '' sleep apnea screen questionnaire , administer study staff . The STOPBang questionnaire screen tool consist eight item reflect OSA risk factor . OSA risk STOPBang score â‰¥3 indicate elevate risk moderatesevere OSA general population , score low 2 frequently see MS patient OSA , base previous data PI ) . OR Have preexist diagnosis OSA base previous overnight sleep study ( either home study inlab ) yet start use PAP therapy compliant basis . *If OSA NOT diagnose UM inlab sleep study within past year prior screening , subject must willing get new baseline inlab UM PSG part study . 6 . Willingness start treatment PAP OSA present 1 . Physical , psychiatric cognitive impairment prevents informed consent , PSG , PAP use , reliable longitudinal followup 2 . Cardiopulmonary condition may increase sleep apnea risk 3 . Current treatment , PAP , obstructive central sleep apnea 4 . History surgical treatment OSA 5 . Nervous system disease MS may predispose subject OSA ( Parkinson 's disease , amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , recent stroke ) 6 . History concomitant central nervous system disease could influence cognition , large vessel territory stroke , Alzheimer 's disease , Parkinson 's disease , Lewy body dementia 7 . Concomitant systemic autoimmune disease 8 . Pregnancy 9 . Evidence clinical MS relapse within last 30 day prior enrollment 10 . Steroid use within last 30 day prior enrollment 11 . Unwillingness initiate PAP therapy clinically indicate 12 . Severe depression screen per Patient Health Questionnaire8 ( PHQ8 ) ( The PHQ8 brief , selfadministered questionnaire evaluates core symptom associate major depressive disorder . Scores range 0 24 base frequency severity depressive symptom previous two week . ) 13 . Anticipated initiation , dosage change , discontinuation medication could , per opinion investigator , influence cognitive test score baseline followup , include MS disease modify therapy , hypnotic agent , narcoticbased medication , benzodiazepine , antispasmodic , 4aminopyridine 14 . ESS score &gt; = 16 baseline visit 15 . Subjects extreme OSA accompany sign cardiopulmonary compromise ( RDI &gt; 60 respiratory event per hour severe nocturnal hypoxia unstable ECG rhythm PSG ) , exclude unless randomize immediate PAP arm 16 . Any condition treatment opinion investigator could affect subject safety study eligibility</criteria>
