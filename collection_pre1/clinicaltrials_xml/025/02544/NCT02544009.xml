	<brief_summary>Background : Many people regain weight lose diet exercise . This might happen weight loss slow metabolism . This slow call metabolic adaptation . It may cause people regain weight keep high level exercise major caloric restriction . Researchers want find long-term effect metabolic adaptation previous Biggest Loser study participant . They hope learn body response lifestyle change result weight loss . They also want see certain change lead longer-term success maintain weight loss . Objectives : To good understand long-term metabolic change cause rapid weight loss achieve diet restriction vigorous physical activity . Eligibility : Former Biggest Loser research study participant ( Protocol No . PBRC29008 ) . Design : Participants screen phone interview . This study 3 phase . Phase 1 last least 3 week . Participants receive physical activity monitor wireless scale . These send daily weight activity back NIH . In Phase 2 , participant stay NIH 3 day . Their metabolism measure : Their activity monitor Urine sample daily body weight Medical review physical exam Fasting 12 hour night blood draw follow morning DEXA : low-dose x-ray body BIS : Electrodes hand/wrist foot/ankle measure body water content . Phase 3 last least 3 week . Participants : Continue monitor daily weight activity Collect urine sample send back NIH</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Quantifying Persistence Metabolic Adaptation Weight Regain Following Extreme Weight Loss</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Weight loss accompany slow metabolic rate . Metabolic slow often occur degree great predict amount weight lose , phenomenon call metabolic adaptation , hypothesize persist time promote weight regain . We previously discover large metabolic adaptation response intensive lifestyle intervention part The Biggest Loser weight loss competition . Those subject rapidly lose massive amount weight rest energy expenditure decrease ~500 kcal/d expect base body composition end intervention . The purpose study investigate whether metabolic adaptation persist year follow intervention subject . Furthermore , measure body weight composition subject investigate correlate weight regain .</detailed_description>
