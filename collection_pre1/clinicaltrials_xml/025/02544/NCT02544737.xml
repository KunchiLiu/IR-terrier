	<detailed_description>The purpose study determine effect apatinib metastatic esophageal cancer patient treat surgery definitive chemoradiotherapy . These effect include whether apatinib could shrink tumor slow growth side effect apatinib tumor . Eligible patient metastatic esophageal cancer achieve stable disease disease progression systemic therapy ( surgery definitive chemoradiotherapy ) least one separate measurable site metastatic lesion . Extent metastatic disease record either CT MRI scan . Apatinib ( 850mg ) give daily therapy 28 day . Tumor response evaluate assess clinical CT/MRI response metastatic site . A Phase II clinical trial base optimum two-stage Phase II Simon design use conduct pilot study . Ten patient treated Stage one ; tumor response , trial terminate . If one responses Stage One , trial proceed enroll additional 19 patient .</detailed_description>
