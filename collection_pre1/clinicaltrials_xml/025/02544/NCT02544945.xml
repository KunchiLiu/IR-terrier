	<brief_summary>This cohort study 16 woman undergo post-mastectomy chest wall radiotherapy breast cancer compare two way modify radiation beam bolus ( 5mm rubber substance place skin modify radiation beam ) . The hypothesis 3D print bolus conform closely chest wall standard 5mm-thick standard bolus thus lead less chance underdose overdose skin . Each patient receive standard dose radiotherapy , half treatment use standard bolus half treatment 3D printed bolus ( ie patient act control ) . The primary outcome comparison amount air bolus technique . Secondary outcome amount time take set patient radiotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparing 3-D Printed v Standard Bolus Breast Cancer Chest Wall Radiotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Study Schema Intervention All subject receive standard chest wall radiotherapy dose follow : - Half day bolus applied chest wall per standard care - Half day bolus apply - alternating day standard 5mm rubber bolus experimental 3D printed bolus . Primary Secondary Outcomes Each subject act control compare standard rubber bolus 3D printed bolus term - The volume air-gap bolus chest wall skin - The time take radiation therapist set patient - The calculated versus measure dose skin Sample size 16 patient 4 month 2 . Background Rationale In Canada , 25,000 woman diagnose breast cancer year . Approximately 20 % woman undergo mastectomy ( removal entire breast ) part curative treatment program . Radiotherapy administer chest wall ( breast ) woman whose breast cancer spread lymph node situation high chance might microscopic amount cancer cell leave chest wall . A meta-analysis 25 randomized trial involve 8505 lymph node positive woman show post-mastectomy radiotherapy improve 10-year chest wall control rate 73 % 92.5 % . The overview show 15-year overall survival increase 5.4 % ( 60.1 vs 54.7 % ) woman undergo radiotherapy compare . Applying radiotherapy evenly chest wall course 16-25 daily radiation treatment technically challenge , without modification , high-energy radiotherapy machine under-dose superficial tissue ( exactly cancer cell might reside ) . To compensate phenomenon , flexible polymer ( rubber ) `` bolus '' layer 3-10 mm thick place skin chest wall day radiation course . All sort bolus use internationally rubber candle wax slab . This standard 'bolus ' , typically 40 cm wide 40 cm long , place chest wall keep place tape strap 15 minute take set administer radiotherapy day bolus apply . Because contour woman 's chest wall different often include 'peaks valley ' tissue , inevitably 'air gap ' skin bolus material . This air gap , see easily set imaging , varies day day radiation therapist ca n't reproduce exact placement bolus , woman undergo treatment ca n't get back exact position radiotherapy bed day . The vary air gap affect much radiotherapy get skin , produce potential under-dosing cancer cell overdose normal skin . In Department Radiation Oncology Halifax investigator develop innovative solution problem air gap use 3D print technology create bolus tailor exact shape patient 's chest wall . The investigator approximately 3 year experience produce 3D printed bolus radiotherapy application , include rigorous assessment spatial dosimetric accuracy tissue underneath bolus . Previous research focus medical physic validation study , produce 'smart bolus ' tailor electron therapy treatment multiple treatment site . Through work investigator demonstrate printed bolus conforms precisely even complex patient anatomy , base realistic phantom study ( i.e. , model patient include challenge situation e.g. , treat part foot ear ) . The bolus design directly plan CT data patient anatomy , require patient usual treatment planning calculation . The 3D print bolus typically 5 mm thick x-ray photon beam application consist polylactic acid ( PLA ) , derive starch ( corn , sugar tapioca ) , inert , commonly use e.g. , drink cup surgical pin . The average density 3D bolus controllable printing thus investigator able replicate density standard rubber bolus material . The investigator show previously material accurately account treatment planning system confirm another study . A recent in-house study 3D print bolus thickness use study show calculate measured machine closely correlate . In proposed study , produce 3D printed bolus patient 's chest wall could produce multiple advantage current technique : 1 . The 3D bolus may decrease amount air gap bolus skin . Air gap currently limit accuracy uniformity deliver radiation therapy . The 3D printed bolus would individualize every patient design fabricate sub-millimeter precision ; 2 . The time require multiple radiation therapist prepare bolus setup prior CT imaging may reduce , particularly challenge anatomy , give 3D printed bolus produce automated way CT data afterwards ( without patient therapist present ) . 3 . The time set patient treatment machine ( linear accelerator ) may decrease individualized bolus 'slips ' place ( compare status-quo bolus position iterative , error-prone time-consuming ) . 4 . As patient individualized bolus , issue infection control ( contamination bacteria reuse standard bolus ) mitigate . 3 . Study Objectives To test whether 3D printed bolus produce less air gap , faster apply , produce reliable buildup radiotherapy compare standard rubber bolus woman undergo chest wall radiotherapy . 4 . Study Methods This single-centre study accrue breast cancer patient already agree undergo chest wall radiotherapy Study Flow Individual Patient 1 . Accrual patient completion consent process 2 . CT simulation standard bolus production ( do exactly per current standard care ) 3 . Production 3D printed bolus use Simulation CT scan 4 . Choice location calculation skin dose 5 . Creation individualized patient treatment plan - Plan generate dosimetrists - alternate bolus bolus - Outline day standard bolus 3D bolus 6 . Delivery Radiotherapy No bolus days- per standard care 7 . Delivery Radiotherapy Bolus day - Application Diodes Chest wall - Timing Set time - CBCT scan machine set ( allows measurement air gap afterwards ) 8 . Monitoring patient treatment - Air gap calculation - Measured dose skin - Skin reaction</detailed_description>
