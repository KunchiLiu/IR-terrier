	<detailed_description>Context The survival time number long time survivor radiotherapy brain cancer patient increase last decade . Therefore topic late-delayed neurotoxic effect therapy gain importance . Among side effect , main frequent one leukoencephalopathy , diffuse progressive damage white matter characterize myelin loss , loss axon vascular lesion . The incidence rate assessment , well occurrence time , base retrospective study low number patient , seem reach 30 50 % patient accord follow-up . The risk seem increase first two year radiotherapy , persist decade . No complete characterization cognitive impairment do yet due crucial discrepancy neuropsychological assessment use ( namely miss pre-treatment assessment ) , follow-up patient apply treatment . However , base previous study , say short term memory frontal function mainly affect quality life exceedingly impaired . Irradiation scheme , particular high dos large irradiated volume , identify risk factor leukoencephalopathy . However , spite modify protocol tend limit risk , remain occurrence disease suggest high dependency individual risk factor , still poorly know make individual sensitivity develop secondary effect unpredictable . Other factor cardio-vascular factor , smoking , old age combine radio-chemotherapy link leukoencephalopathy well , although association prove large study . Moreover , specific bio-markers could complete clinical examination predict risk cognitive impairment patient . Several biomarkers could interest : The protein S-100B protein synthesize mainly glial cell cell Schwann . It intracellular protein regulate cytosolic availability calcium . Its concentration 30-100 time brought cerebral tissue tissue . Its plasmatic half-life 1 hour , elimination renal . So , protein S-100B marker traumatic brain injury , certain neurodegenerative disorder malignant glioma . The dosage maybe realize serum urine . - Growing evidence implicates oxidative/nitrative damage pathogenesis neurodegenerative disorder . Subsequent study undertake show specific isoprostanes ( iPs ) level elevate urine blood Alzheimer Disease patient value correlate memory impairment . This suggest iPs useful biomarkers neurological disease . Their level could measure urine plasma patient . - Homocysteine sulfur-containing amino acid , derive metabolism methionine . Higher level homocysteine associate bad memory performance large group old subject . While homocysteine diagnostic test , may represent modifiable risk factor dementia . Highlighting neuropsychological disorder include early stage require reliable reproducible assessment patient 's cognitive state . However , comprehensive neuropsychological assessment take several hour qualified staff , make difficult implement conventional patient monitoring . The use simple fast tool detect cognitive impairment would help develop systematic approach screen disorder . A detection computerized neuropsychological standardize test ( Computerized Cognitive Speed Test - CSCT ) assess process speed information , attention work memory validate multiple sclerosis patient compare healthy volunteer . CSCT quickly detect patient cognitive impairment , could test complete test . It conduct people neuropsychology train test time le 2 minute . This study allow good understanding impact cognitive sequela patient treat glioma current standard treatment , include radiation . The validation new screen test , CSCT , disease eventually detect earlier effect possibly initiate treatment lesion advance . Feasibility implementation CSCT `` routine '' practice patient treat brain radiotherapy test . • Objectives methodology To gain insight radiation-induced leukoencephalopathy , objective project study onset evolution leukoencephalopathy 3-year prospective cohort patient undergone cerebral radiotherapy glioma ( stage 3-4 ) , use specific cognitive test , MRI scan brain predictive bio-markers cognitive impairment . Primary objective : - To constitute prospective cohort patient treat glioma ( stage 3-4 ) radiotherapy order estimate incidence rate occurrence time leukoencephalopathy end follow-up ( 3 year first inclusion ) . Secondary objective : - To validate CSCT- Computerised Speed Cognitive Test detect early cognitive impairment patient population compare complete cognitive test - Estimate precisely dose receive different anatomical part brain - To study relation risk leukoencephalopathy receive dose brain - To analyze prognostic risk factor leukoencephalopathy ( either link radiation treatment patient ' clinical condition ) among patient glioma ( stage 3-4 ) - To propose test bio-markers predictive factor cognitive impairment - To study radiological change MRI associate neurological abnormality - To build biological collection patient treat Pitié Salpêtrière Hospital Patients diagnostic glioma ( stage 3-4 ) treat radiotherapy 2 hospital ( Hospital Pitié Salpêtrière , Paris Institut Paul Strauss , Strasbourg ) eligible study . Taking account 100 patient glioma treat every year Radiation Oncologic department Pitié Salpêtrière Hospital 50 Paul Strauss Institute , inclusion 200 patient take 2 year . Considering survival patient rather short , median 2 year glioma 3-4 , complete follow-up available majority high glioma stage , likely develop leukoencephalopathy . The study mainly observational follow-up patient base classical monitoring . The additional information collect come CSCT test , simple quick test ( 90 second ) identify mild cognitive dysfunction . A detailed neurological assessment neuro-psychologist perform radiotherapy , 12 36 month radiotherapy case abnormality CSCT . Methodology - Study design : Observational prospective cohort 200 patient , follow every 2-3 month period 3 year enrolment . - Eligibility : Study population : Patients undergo brain radiotherapy glioma ( stage 3 4 ) April 2015 April 2017 Mazarin Radiotherapy Department , Pitié-Salpêtrière University Hospital Paul Strauss Institute , Strasbourg . Before radiotherapy : - Description cancer : histological type , date diagnosis , treatment cancer : type surgery ( total partial resection ) , chemotherapy , etc… - The radiotherapy planning record : type radiotherapy ( whole brain radiotherapy , stereotactic radiotherapy ) , total fractionary deliver dos , - Results CSCT test detail neuro-psychological test treatment Comorbidities collect medical record : hypertension , diabetes , smoke habit , cardiovascular disease , etc… After radiotherapy , every 2-3 month : During routine consultation neuro-oncologists , follow information collect : - Clinical examination : brain feature : intracranial high pressure , progressive focal neurological deficit , epilepsia… toxicity feature : alert symptom ( amnesia , dysexecutive disorder , gait trouble , urinary dysfunction ) - MRI scan brain : tumor feature : progression , stability , response toxicity feature - Results CSCT test Additional data collect : - Neurocognitive test result perform dedicated consultation neuropsychologist : radiotherapy 12 36 month radiotherapy - Blood sample : radiotherapy 12 36 month radiotherapy In case abnormal result 2 consecutive CSCT test ( -1.5 Standard deviation ( SD ) loss ) exclusion relapse MRI , additional cognitive test perform dedicated consultation neuropsychologist . At end follow-up , vital status lose follow-up patient assess National Register Identification Physical Persons ( RNIPP ) . - Outcomes : Primary outcome Cognitive dysfunction due leukoencephalopathy define abnormal result CSCT test ( confirm complete cognitive test ) MRI scan brain ( exclusion brain tumor relapse ) . Secondary outcome - Overall death - Death associate leukoencephalopathy cognitive dysfunction ● Data analysis : In longitudinal study , survival analysis method apply . Occurrence time leukoencephalopathy incidence rate different follow-up time point ( month 6 , 12 , 18 36 ) consider . The Kaplan-Meier estimator use estimate leukoencephalopathy free survival function . For potential risk factor , hazard ratio associate outcomes estimate use Cox model . Specificity sensitivity CSCT assess comparison complete cognitive test ( gold standard ) This project involve Neurology department Radiotherapy department Pitié Salpétrière University Hospital Paul Strauss Institute</detailed_description>
