	<detailed_description>AHFS management challenge give heterogeniety patient population , absence universally accept definition , incomplete understand pathophysiology , lack evidence base guideline . The majority patient appear respond well initial therapy consist loop diuretic vasoactive agent . however , treatment fail decrease post-discharge mortality readmission rate represent important goal AHFS . In last year , many drug test AHFS set try adress issue , however result disappointing term efficacy / safety . Although evidence support beneficial effect digoxin hemodynamic , neurohormonal , electrophysiological parameter patient CHF , recent publication rise concern safety profile therefore decrease use . The effect digoxin alone combination vasodilator see within hour administration result increase cardiac output , decrease pulmonary wedge pressure , increase ejection fraction , improve neurohormonal profile without change blood pressure . All finding make u rise question whether digoxin effective short term treatment acute heart failure ?</detailed_description>
