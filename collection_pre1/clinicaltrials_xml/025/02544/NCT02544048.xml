	<brief_summary>Background : People malaria often show alter immune response many illness vaccine . This mean malaria might cause immune suppression . It clear vaccine impact malaria . It also clear impact people preemptively treat get vaccination . Researchers want see link take antimalaria drug prior get vaccine immune response vaccine . To , study people take part certain NIAID study . Objectives : To compare proportion PD1+ CD4 T cell among T cell vaccine immune response adult receive antimalarial prior get Menactra vaccine . Eligibility : Healthy Malian adult : Were previously enrol NIAID Protocol 13-I-N109 15-I-0044 Reside Bancoumana neighboring village Are pregnant Design : Participants screen physical exam . Participants get vaccine list part Protocol 13-I-N109 15-I-0044 . This study follow schedule . At visit , participant give blood sample . They also physical exam . Each visit last 1 2 hour . At visit 1 , participant get hepatitis vaccine . Two week later , participant may get antimalarial drug Coartem . They choose random . Two week later , participant get Menactra . Participants 5 follow-up visit get Menactra . The study last 4 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Malaria patient often show alter immune response , malaria parasite also unrelated pathogen ( eg , HIV , EBV , salmonella , helminthes ) antigen , include routine vaccine , suggest active immune suppression accurately perhaps , immunomodulation , occur course malaria infection . How vaccine impact clinical malaria asymptomatic parasitemia completely clear whether impact significant enough recommend delay pre-emptively treat individual prior vaccination . Up 75 adult recruit volunteer enrol NIAID protocol 13-I-N109 NIAID protocol 15-I-0044 unblinding opt receive complete comparator vaccine series : Euvax ( Hepatitis B ) TWINRIX ( Hepatitis B ) Menactra ( Meningococcal ) . This longitudinal study conduct Bancoumana neighbor village Mali . In September 2015 , 50 adult present Vaccination # 3 Euvax enrol NIAID protocol 13-I-N109 . In October 2015 , 25 adult present Study Day 168 enrol follow unblinding NIAID protocol 15-I-0044 . Following receipt Euvax B TWINRIX vaccination , subject randomize receive receive course Coartem ( artemether-lumefantrine ) 2 week prior schedule Menactra vaccination . They follow approximately 3 month post receipt Menactra . Samples collect adult time prior follow receipt vaccination assess ex vivo assay marker T-cell suppression primary outcome study . For secondary outcome , examine level regulatory T cell , measure T cell response stimulation assay , survey parasitemia blood smear polymerase chain reaction assay . We expect level T-cell suppression regulatory T cell similar group antimalarial treatment malaria infection , treatment subject remain uninfected level significantly low compare untreated infected subject .</detailed_description>
