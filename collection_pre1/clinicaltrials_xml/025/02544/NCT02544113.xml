	<brief_summary>This 24-month , Phase II , multi-center , two-arm , randomize control study adult patient receive single organ liver transplant decease donor ; purpose determine efficacy Thymoglobulin® induction delay initiation CNI long-term preservation renal function liver transplantation . This study base outcomes earlier phase 1 pilot study perform Cleveland Clinic . This study conduct 3 center , 110 subject randomize 1:1 two group : Group 1 receive Thymoglobulin® induction , ( 4.5 mg/Kg , 3 dos 1.5 mg/Kg/dose ) delay initiation CNI begin Day 10 post LT. Group 2 receive early CNI initiation ( started later Day 2 post LT ) , Thymoglobulin® induction ( antibody ) . All subject also receive maintenance immunosuppressive regimen consist corticosteroid mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) accord standard practice orthotopic liver transplantation ( OLT ) . Subjects consent pre-transplant . Participation may last 12 month post OLT . There 15 study-related visit complete standard care ( SOC ) visit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial Thymoglobulin® After Liver Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Functional recovery renal function acute renal failure occur 75 % patient approximately 14 day onset disease . In liver transplantation , intraoperative hemodynamic insult typically lead acute renal failure may worsen exposure CNI therapy early postoperative period . In practice , patient demonstrate early evidence acute renal failure often CNI therapy delay 4-5 day . This duration CNI delay short salutary effect course severity acute kidney injury le 20 % patient experience functional recovery day 5 . Thymoglobulin® ( Sanofi , Cambridge , MA ) polyclonal immunosuppressive agent derive rabbit immunize pediatric thymocytes . It contain antibody wide variety T-cell antigens major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) antigens approved treatment kidney rejection FDA . Thymoglobulin® show safe efficacious induction therapy permit delay exposure CNI therapy prevent occurrence acute rejection kidney transplantation . The investigator hypothesize perioperative insult lead AKI OLT recipient unlikely beneficially impact short delay CNI introduction . Further hypothesize avoidance CNI 10 day beneficial effect course severity perioperative AKI . Since perioperative AKI potent risk factor chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) late post-transplant period , also hypothesize minimize risk severity AKI prolong delay exposure CNI beneficial effect renal function late liver transplantation .</detailed_description>
