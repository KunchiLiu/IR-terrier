	<criteria>1 . A. Relapsed refractory acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) , base World Health Organization Classification ; Patients must morphological proof AML ALL blast peripheral blood ( PB ) 5 % bone marrow ( BM ) within 2 week prior study registration . I. Refractory disease consider failure either respond induction chemotherapy and/or salvage therapy . II . 2nd relapse III . Relapse follow autologous allogeneic stem cell transplantation . B. patient physician discretion eligible standard chemotherapy , whether induction consolidation , due age significant comorbidities 2 . Age ≥18 year . 3 . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . 4 . Female patient childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test within 2 week prior enrollment use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . 5 . Male subject agree use acceptable method contraception duration study . 6 . Eastern cooperative oncology group ( ECOG ) performance status ≤ 2 7 . Hydroxyurea permit control high white blood cell ( WBC ) count prior study entry . 8 . Previous treatment related toxicity must resolve less Grade 2 ( exclude alopecia ) . 1 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , serious cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . l. Myocardial infarction within 6 month prior enrollment New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class III IV heart failure , uncontrolled angina , uncontrolled hypertension , severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia , electrocardiographic evidence acute ischemia active conduction system abnormality . Prior study entry , ECG abnormality screen document investigator medically relevant . 2 . Patients compromise pulmonary function need oxygen therapy . 3 . Any significant concurrent disease , illness , psychiatric disorder would compromise patient safety compliance , interfere consent , study participation , follow , interpretation study result . 4 . Patients chemotherapy ( except hydroxyurea ) , biologic therapy , immunotherapy , radiotherapy within 2 week induction therapy 4 week consolidation intensive therapy ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . 5 . Patients receive investigational agent . 6 . Patients surgical procedure , exclude central venous catheter placement minor procedure ( e.g . skin biopsy ) within 14 day Day 1 . 7 . Serious medical psychiatric illness likely interfere participation clinical study . 8 . Patients prior malignancy eligible ; however , patient must remission prior malignancy complete chemotherapy radiotherapy least 6 month prior registration treatmentrelated toxicity must resolve . 9 . Leptomeningeal/ central nervous system involvement AML ; lumbar puncture need perform unless clinical suspicion . 10 . Patients active central nervous system disease granulocytic sarcoma sole site disease . 11 . Patients prior pulmonary radiation . 12 . Liver enzymes ( AST alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) 2.5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) , total bilirubin 1.5 x ULN within 14 day enrollment . 13 . Renal function : Serum creatinine 1.5 x ULN within 24 hour enrollment . 14 . Existence intercurrent organ damage medical condition would prohibit interfere study drug therapy . 15 . If patient comorbid medical illness , life expectancy attribute must great 3 month . 16 . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition Astarabine/AraC . 17 . Pregnant woman exclude study Astarabine/AraC agents potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother Astarabine , breastfeed discontinue mother treated Astarabine . 18. known history Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) active hepatitis B C 19 . Concurrent use follow medication : Digoxin , Gentamycin , fluorocytosine , Lasparginase , drug supplement interfere blood clot raise risk bleed treatment AraC . These include : vitamin E , nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) aspirin , warfarin , ticlopidine , clopidogrel .</criteria>
