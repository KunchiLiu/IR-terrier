	<brief_summary>Rheumatoid Arthritis ( RA ) chronic potentially severe autoimmune disease affect 2 million United States . The role environmental factor modulate autoimmunity pathogenesis clearly describe yet specific mechanisms action remain poorly understood . A grow body evidence implicate microbiota mucosal surface development autoimmune disorder . Various study clearly link RA periodontal disease . The latter link red-complex include oral bacterium Porphyromonas gingivalis . And yet systematic analysis oral microbiota RA determine whether specific marker P. gingivalis ( oral bacteria ) link RA . In study , investigator characterize oral microbial composition ( microbiome ) gene content ( metagenome ) DNA isolated oral sample obtain patient ( ) early stage RA prior biologics treatment ( ii ) subset RA patient responsive unresponsive anti-TNF-alpha therapy . The innovative aspect study go beyond identification oral bacterial specie , level strain gene associate group . The overall hypothesis oral microbial variation exist individual influence development autoimmunity autoimmune disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This multi-disciplinary research study five investigator different , yet complementary , discipline establish new collaboration . There high translational potential information gain project base collaboration rheumatologist , dentist , oral biologist , infectious disease expert expertise immunology , microbiology , genomics . In brief , RA participant recruit rheumatologist . A total 100 participant recruit two group study ; one group subject RA group healthy control . These two group divide follow group participation study : Group 1 : consist 25 RA adult subject treat biologics compare 25 healthy control age-matched member household . Group 2 consist 25 RA adult subject responsive first line anti-TNF therapy compare 25 subject age sex RA resistant two TNF antagonist . The participant schedule research study visit University Florida Dental Clinic Research Unit . During exam follow take place : multidimensional health assessment questionnaire ( MDHAQ ) , dental exam , saliva collection , dental plaque remove different tooth surface supragingival . The supragingival subject deep sequencing genomics lab . To test two specific aim : 1 ) test hypothesis oral microbiome profile base 16S RNA data associate development RA response specific therapy , 2 ) test hypothesis specific gene , variant , functional capability ( metagenome ) associate RA therapeutic response . Upon completion pilot study , investigator systematically identify bacterial biomarkers ( e.g . specie , subspecies , gene ) correlate RA may serve potential target disease treatment . These marker may develop new drug target RA therapy future study .</detailed_description>
