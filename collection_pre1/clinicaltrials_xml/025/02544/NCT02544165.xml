	<detailed_description>Materials method Study population The study population consist student Health Care Professions accept participate study give inform consent participation . The population study include healthy volunteer without cardiovascular problem , chronic systemic disease . Participants divide 3 intervention group : first group non-smokers consume caffeine daily basis , second group smoker consume caffeine daily basis , third group smoker consume caffeine daily basis . Additionally , control group consist non smoke student caffeine user daily basis . Methodology A complete medical history information health status subject , drug use main risk factor cardiovascular condition record . Details concern smoke drinking habit , caffeine intake medical condition condition individual family history retrieve , filling-in self-reporting questionnaire . Information dietary habit physical activity subject also record . Body weight height participant measure . Also , participant inform day schedule measurement , breakfast smoke 2 hour ( smoker ) prior measurement finally abstain physical activity . Inclusion criterion group smoker cigarette smoke 10 cigarettes/day least 2 year . Skin- autofluorescence measurement Tissue AGEs accumulation assess use validate skin-autofluorescence ( skin-AF ) device , namely AGE Reader . In short , AGE reader illuminate skin surface approximately 4 cm2 , guard surround light , excitation light source 300 420 nm ( peak excitation ~370 nm ) . Skin-AF measured volar side low arm approximately 10-15 cm elbow fold . Care take perform measurement normal skin site ( without visible vessel , scar , lichenification , skin abnormality ) . The investigator perform three measurement 5min interval investigator calculate mean value three measurement . For individual smoke , measurement repeat 2 hour smoke one cigarette individual consume caffeine , measurement repeat intake 100 mg caffeine ( deliver beverage ) . This do check whether change accumulation AGEs follow cigarette smoke caffeine intake . Haemodynamic parameter ' measurement The haemodynamic parameter ' measurement include measurement cardiac output , stroke volume , systolic diastolic blood pressure , mean pressure , pulse rate , interbeat interval , arterial compliance systemic vascular resistance . These measurement perform Finometer device ( FMS , Finapress Medical System , BV , Netherlands ) , data record use Beatscope , specially design software , transfer data PC process pressure waveform file . The measurement perform use non-invasive method via finger cuff , wrap around finger individual , lie position 10 min measurement room sound-attenuated , temperature-controlled environment , order ensure measurement perform constant stable condition . Subsequently , haemodynamic parameter ' measurement perform 15 min sit position . Additionally , smoker measurement repeat 15-30 min since smoke one cigarette 45 min individual consume caffeine .</detailed_description>
