	<brief_title>Out Patient Surgery Total Knee Hip Replacement Unicompartmental Knee Replacement - Feasibility Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fast-track total hip arthroplasty ( THA ) , total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) Unicompartmental Knee arthroplasty ( UKA ) length stay ( LOS ) 1-3 well establish concept treat hip knee osteoarthritis , result short reconvalescence , high patient satisfaction , excellent safety profile ( low similar mortality / morbidity compare conventional pathway longer LOS ) . LOS significantly reduce past decade , several center publish even short hospital stay : &lt; 24 hour , patient stay night hospital also outpatient surgery , patient discharge day surgery . However , propose pathway extremely short LOS , perform select patient , detail patient satisfaction , outcome important patient safety . Therefore , possible draw conclusion feasibility outpatient THA , TKA UKA surgery general unselected population . Further , need investigation safety aspect outpatient surgery respect mortality , morbidity , patient satisfaction patient report outcomes . As , likely healthy young , patient might benefit outpatient surgery - eg discharge day surgery , others might ; first step identify patient suitable outpatient THA TKA surgery investigate safety aspect respect mortality , morbidity , patient satisfaction patient report outcome . Aim : The aim study investigate `` feasibility '' `` safety '' outpatient THA , TKA UKA surgery , respectively follow : Feasibility - Proportion patient , include study accord inclusion criterion state , evaluate potential same-day discharge ( I ) ( I = include ) - Proportion include patient ( I ) , discharge day surgery ( U ) discharge stay &gt; 1 day ( B ) - Identify reason patient able discharged day surgery ( B ) Safety - risk complication ( morbidity ) group ( U ) compare group ( B ) ( complication potentially could avoid patient discharge ) - readmission group ( U ) compare group ( B ) within 90 day - mortality group ( U ) compare group ( B ) within 90 day - patient satisfaction group ( U ) compare group ( B ) - Patient report outcome ( Oxford knee score + range motion TKA UKA group , Oxford hip score THA group ) group ( U ) compare group ( B ) - contact primary sector group ( U ) compare group ( B ) within 7 day . - use rescue morphine ( pain journal ) 7 day post op group ( U ) compare group ( B )</detailed_description>
