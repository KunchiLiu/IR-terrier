	<detailed_description>Febrile neutropenia ( FN ) major complication cancer patient undergo intensive chemotherapy . Endogenous flora consider one main source infection neutropenic patient . The first step infection process colonization intestine pathogenic bacteria subsequent translocation intestinal mucosa systemic dissemination . The alteration intestinal flora occurs due chemotherapy also due use broad spectrum antibiotic , suppresses anaerobic growth normal gut flora lead damage colonization resistance . Competitive inhibition gut mucosal colonization pathogenic micro-organism use synbiotics could represent one potential option prevention febrile neutropenia cancer patient . Compared exist selective bowel decontamination quinolones and/or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole , investigator may expect also reduction incidence fungal Gram-positive infection due change intestinal microflora . Based result animal study , probiotic could probably also lead reduction duration neutropenia boost immunity . Synbiotics represent combination two component : probiotic prebiotics . Probiotics live microorganism , form drug food supplement administer sufficient dose help maintain health beneficial microbial balance digestive tract human host . Prebiotics food ingredient nondigestible digestive enzyme , ferment bacteria bowel way selectively stimulate growth activity specific saccharolytic bacterial strain . Lactic acid bacteria currently widely use prevention treatment certain infectious disease . They stimulate immune system , compete substrate pathogenic bacteria , produce bacteriocins , competitively inhibit bacterial adhesion site , increase transepithelial resistance bind mutagen . Current evidence support probiotic use adjunctive therapy anticancer treatment limit , especially cancer patient treat chemotherapy . Some report support beneficial effect certain aspect toxicity relate chemotherapy radiation therapy ; however , large properly design clinical trial need assess real position part anticancer treatment . Eleven study cancer patient include meta-analysis ass efficacy probiotic . Results show probiotic may reduce severity frequency diarrhoea patient cancer may reduce requirement anti-diarrhoeal medication , still study need assess true effect . The importance probiotic treatment acute diarrhea support meta-analysis 34 randomize placebo-controlled study , show significant reduction diarrhea incidence well effect especially pediatric group . Most study perform probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG ( LGG ) . The duration rotavirus diarrhea child diarrhea immunocompromised HIV-positive patient significantly shorten administration certain strain Lactobacilli resp . Saccharomyces boulardii . Investigators find anecdotal report use probiotic patient neutropenia . In experimental model cyclophosphamide-treated mice preventive treatment immunomodulatory lactobacillus successfully use protect myelosuppression immunosuppression . Lactobacilli able induce early recovery neutrophils blood , improve phagocytic cell recruitment infectious site increase resistance opportunistic pathogen C. albicans . In another similar study administration heat-inactivated strain Enterococcus faecalis shorten duration cyclophosphamide-induced neutropenia speed restitution neutrophil count . The important feature lactic acid bacteria ability produce fatty acid short chain , important metabolite colonocytes way may participate fast restitution mucosa chemotherapy . Probiotics fall category organism classify `` generally regarded safe '' . The safety concern probiotic administration cancer patient relate mainly risk infection cause probiotic bacteria transfer antibiotic resistance . Many probiotic strain naturally resistant antibiotic , majority resistance intrinsic ( chromosomally encode ) therefore nontransmissible . This could danger , probiotic become infectious agent , hand probiotic strain intrinsically antibiotic-resistance may benefit patient , whose normal intestinal microflora become greatly reduce unbalanced due administration various antimicrobial agent . For strain ( e.g . LGG ) plasmid-free status proven , time show , strain may carry potentially transmissible plasmid-encoded antibiotic resistance gene , could lead formation new antibiotic-resistant pathogen . Therefore , one key requirement probiotic strain carry transmissible antibiotic resistance gene . Despite fact , incidence infection cause lactic acid bacteria extremely low , exist certain risk , become pathogenic . In case report probiotic mention cause local infection chest infection , digestive tract infection , urinary tract infection , meningitis . Though report lactobacilli bacteremia unusual rare pediatric population . They naturally often observe immunocompromised patient , patient bone marrow transplantation patient AIDS , also demonstrate low-virulency strain . Moreover , clinical isolates L. rhamnosus capture case significant phenotypical difference one property associate virulence compare , use probiotic strain . Concerns iatrogenic infection one main reason limit experience administration probiotic granulocytopenic patient . In addition , due chemotherapy come neutropenia also local affection gut mucosa therefore hypothetically arise possibility bacterial translocation . This phenomenon cause defective intestinal barrier , immunosuppression also gut prematurity . It describe passage viable indigenous bacteria gastrointestinal tract extraintestinal site may result transfer bacteria organ , thereby potentially cause bacteremia , septicemia , multiple organ failure . However , evidence animal model study suggest actually reduction translocation bacteria probiotic give , opposed transmigration probiotic bacteria bloodstream . The concern around bacteraemia/fungaemia blood culture growth significant cancer patient , risk need consider alongside potential benefit . Systematic review include 17 study cancer patient identify five case report 756 case describe consume probiotic . Moreover case note also patient know consume probiotic . In addition , evidence population base study increase risk bacteremia endocarditis due probiotic incidence still remain extremely low despite current widespread use probiotic . Even finding small study group specific immunocompromised patient ( e.g. , patient HIV infection ) support safety particular probiotic strain . One recent systematic review identify 11,977 publication , 622 study ( include 24,615 participant use probiotic ) include review . Based report adverse event , randomize control trial show statistically significantly increase relative risk number experienced adverse event ( Relative risk ( RR ) = 1.00 ; 95 % Confidence interval ( CI ) : 0.93 , 1.07 , p = 0.999 ) ; gastrointestinal ; infection ; adverse event , include serious adverse event ( RR = 1.06 ; 95 % CI : 0.97 , 1.16 ; p = 0.201 ) , associate short-term probiotic use compare control group participant ; long-term effect largely unknown . Case study suggest participant compromise health likely experience adverse event associate probiotic . However , randomize control trial ( RCTs ) medium-risk critically ill participant report statistically significantly increase risk adverse event compare control group participant . In conclusion author analysis state , available evidence RCTs indicate increase risk ; however , rare adverse event difficult ass . However , despite substantial number publication , current literature well equip answer question safety probiotic intervention confidence , especially group critically ill patient . Nevertheless , specific probiotic group , lactobacillus bifidobacteria , author report current evidence suggest , risk infection probiotic group similar infection commensal strain though consumption product present negligible risk consumer , include immunocompromised host . Moreover , potential risk need always consider alongside potential benefit . Despite limited data , seem probiotic bacteria live microorganism could safely administer even set neutropenia . Future research focus selection effective safe probiotic strain combination , and/or administration probiotic prebiotics increase success maintain colonization resistance prevention adverse event anticancer treatment . In comparable study phase I. probiotic strain apply 11 cancer patient evaluate benefit safety . Subsequently , 14 patient acute myeloid leukemia treat chemotherapy enrol phase II . None report febrile episode induce probiotic strain severe adverse event record . Despite limited number patient , first direct evidence safety probiotic patient receive chemotherapy . One cause fail efficacy probiotic prevention febrile neutropenia may presence entry infection central venous catheter . Also , efficiency colonization , mucosal damage due chemotherapy dose specific probiotic strain may cause . Another reason may inability one probiotic strain compensate change intestinal microflora induce chemotherapy . One way solve problem may use combination multiple probiotic strain . Appropriate selection strain require , cause must behave antagonistically . Other option use combination prebiotics probiotic . This lead acceleration gut colonization probiotic , also stimulation endogenous flora growth , may enhance colonization resistance another level .</detailed_description>
