	<detailed_description>STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Overview : This pilot randomize control trial ( RCT ) enroll 92 child 6 month 6 year age chronic lung disease ( CLD ) bronchopulmonary dysplasia two pulmonary illness season . If minimum number patient ( n=92 ) Season 1 achieve , perform interim analysis data . However , recruitment reach 92patients first season continue recruit Season 2 ( 2016-2017 ) . These child patient receive primary medical care either High Risk Children Clinic similar High Risk Infant Clinic care premature infant discharge age 2 . Clinic record screen determine eligibility . Patients parental consent give baseline EKG , nasal aspirate , oscillometer reading ( 2 year age ) , six month supply either medication placebo initial study office visit . The medication/placebo take day three day week : Monday , Wednesday Friday . The azithromycin medication dose 5 mg/kg/day . Adjustments dosage amount make 6 month trial . Any child eligible receive Synagis give every 28-30 day clinic . Patients follow monthly basis closely monitor adverse reaction ; occur phone , clinic regularly schedule appointment , and/or necessary illness visit . Any child adverse reaction discontinue medication , continue follow clinically . At clinic visit child present respiratory infection , include pneumonia , upper respiratory illness , bronchiolitis , etc. , he/she additional nasal aspirate oscillometer reading perform . At completion six month treatment phase , child final EKG , final nasal aspirate oscillometer reading perform . Data continue collect follow twelve month , monitor respiratory illness . Study Procedures : Patients randomize REDCap statistical program double blind manner . Parents provide entire 6 month medication placebo . Half patient receive azithromycin dose 5 mg/kg give day Monday , Wednesday , Friday . The dosage adjust trial period . The half , control group , provide placebo medication similar taste , color , texture , consistency , also take day Monday , Wednesday , Friday . Both study medication placebo dispense Corner Compounding Pharmacy , mixed fish-oil base ensure shelf life six month , flavor citrus improve palatability . Parents contact monthly , either clinic phone , monitor adverse reaction , include rash , nausea , vomit , diarrhea , abdominal cramping . If significant adverse reaction occur , medication discontinue . If allergic reaction ( rash shortness breath ) note , blind broken Claudia Pedroza , statistician , involved project . This un-blinding do note allergy medication . After initial appointment , face face encounter ( unscheduled sick visit hospital admission/ER admission Monday Friday ) patient present respiratory symptom , patient evaluate research coordinator one co-investigators . Specifically , patient present follow symptom : cough , wheeze , tachypnea , rhinorrhea , increase respiratory secretion , hypoxemia , and/or increase oxygen requirement , additional nasal aspirate sample oscillometry reading ( patient 2 year age ) perform . These sample also store office Dr. Piedra . At conclusion six month treatment phase , final nasal aspirate sample , oscillometer read EKG perform patient clinic office visit . There expect study visit compensation provide parent patient . Research Aims Primary Aim : To determine prophylactic use azithromycin reduce total number day one unscheduled medical encounter occur clinic , urgent care , emergency room ( ER ) hospital set 3-6 month study period subsequent 2 month . Secondary Aims : 1 . To determine prophylactic use azithromycin reduce total number day one unscheduled medical encounter occur acute respiratory illness clinic , urgent care , ER hospital set 3-6 month study period subsequent 2 month . 2 . To determine administration azithromycin similar number adverse side effect , adverse event lead unscheduled face-to-face clinic , urgent care , ER hospital visit compare placebo 3-6 month study period subsequent 2 month . 3 . To determine prophylactic use azithromycin reduce healthcare cost 3-6 month study period subsequent 2 month . Exploratory Outcomes : 1 . To determine prophylactic use azithromycin reduce level pro-inflammatory cytokine additional biomarkers disease include Lactate Dehydrogenase Myeloid Peroxidase , 10 % . 2 . To determine prophylactic use azithromycin 3-6 month intervention reduce level airway resistance patient CLD respiratory illness baseline compare placebo group measure Airwave Oscillometry System 3 . To determine prophylactic use azithromycin reduce total number unscheduled face-to-face provider visit respiratory related illness clinic , urgent care , emergency room hospital set 12 month intervention phase . Data Analysis Plan : Patients randomize one two different branch REDCap data base randomization program . This double-blind placebo control study . Standard frequentist Bayesian analyse perform use intent-to-treat approach . Total hospital day , total ER visit ( count one day ER visit ) , unscheduled clinic visit ( count one day visit ) analyze related treatment ( Azithromycin v Placebo ) , logistic regression model treatment group covariate random intercept account within patient correlation ( due multiple ED visit ) . To assess probability benefit , use Bayesian hierarchical model interaction term treatment group ( Azithromycin v Placebo ) predefined potential moderator . The group stratify synagis use tracheostomy . Sample size power : Based data HRCC , expect control group 1.6 encounter per child-year ( SD=1.66 ) . Assuming two-sided alpha = 0.05 , sample size 92 ( 46/group ) 80 % power detect difference 1 encounter rate placebo azithromycin group ( i.e. , 1.6 v 0.6 encounter rate 38 % reduction ) . Power limit secondary outcome Bayesian analysis provide estimate probability benefit outcome .</detailed_description>
