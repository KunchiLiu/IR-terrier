	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose ruxolitinib phosphate give together tacrolimus sirolimus prevent acute graft-versus-host disease reduce intensity donor hematopoietic cell transplant patient myelofibrosis . Sometimes transplanted cell donor attack normal tissue transplant patient call graft-versus-host disease . Ruxolitinib phosphate may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . It may also reduce graft-versus-host disease reduce inflammation immune modulation . Giving ruxolitinib phosphate together tacrolimus sirolimus transplant may prevent graft-versus-host disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Among dose level test , determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) recommend phase II dose ( RP2D ) ruxolitinib ( ruxolitinib phosphate ) , give combination tacrolimus sirolimus ( TAC/SIR ) acute graft-versus-host disease ( aGVHD ) prophylaxis part reduce intensity allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant ( HCT ) , patient myelofibrosis relate myeloid neoplasm marrow fibrosis . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine addition ruxolitinib , standard aGVHD prophylactic regimen TAC/SIR , safe evaluation toxicity include : type , frequency , severity , attribution , time course duration . II . To estimate cumulative incidence aGVHD non-relapse mortality ( NRM ) 100-days post transplant . III . To estimate cumulative incidence chronic GVHD 1- 2-years post transplant . IV . To characterize evaluate hematologic recovery , donor cell engraftment immune reconstitution cell count flow cytometry lymphocyte subset . V. To estimate probability overall progression-free survival ( OS/PFS ) 1- 2-years post transplant . VI . To characterize change aGVHD biomarkers ( regenerate islet-derived 3-alpha [ Reg-3alpha ] , soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor I [ sTNF RI ] , interleukin 2 receptor alpha [ IL2Ralpha ] ) , Janus-associated kinase ( JAK ) -regulated pro-inflammatory cytokine ( i.e . interleukin [ IL ] -6 , tumor necrosis factor [ TNF ] alpha , C-reactive protein [ CRP ] , beta 2 microglobulin ) signal transducer activator transcription 3 ( STAT3 ) phosphorylation ( downstream JAK signal ) time aGVHD status/grade . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study ruxolitinib phosphate . PREPARATIVE REGIMEN : Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously ( IV ) day -9 -5 melphalan IV 20 minute day -4 . Beginning great 48 hour completion melphalan , patient undergo peripheral blood stem cell bone marrow transplant accord standard guideline day 0 . GVHD PROPHYLAXIS : Patients receive ruxolitinib phosphate orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day -3 30 taper day 60 , tacrolimus IV continuously PO BID day -3 100 , sirolimus PO daily ( QD ) day -3 100 . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 2 year .</detailed_description>
