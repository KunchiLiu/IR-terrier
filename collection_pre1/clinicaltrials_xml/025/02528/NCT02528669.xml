	<brief_title>Patient Ambulation Post-Op Recovery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Early ambulation post-operative patient show benefit include short length stay and/or few complication . Accelerometers find useful instrument encourage ambulation patient . Accelerometers non-invasive device evaluate change movement , gait , ambulatory activity . Although device beneficial , little research exist best way engage patient ambulation , develop standard ambulation protocol , best algorithms measure ambulation post-operation . This study seek develop standardized activity tracker program encourage patient ambulation allow patient healthcare provider view progress daily walk goal . A total 3,000 patient ask would like participate study . A healthcare provider explain patient benefit get bed , sit , walk invasive procedure . Patients decide participate give accelerometer pre-operation visit surgery still hospital . Patients ask wear accelerometer continuously waking hour . The accelerometer provide patient daily walk goal , reminder time walk , track step count , record time walk , duration walk . Patients ask wear accelerometer post-op visit ( 30 day ) . The follow data point analyze : - Relationship ambulation patient outcomes - Relationship ambulation health factor - Effectiveness prototype platform motivate monitor patient activity</detailed_description>
