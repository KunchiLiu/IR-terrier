	<brief_summary>In randomize control trial single blind study , tender spot identify 150 participant ` plantar flexor muscle ( gastrocnemius soleus ) . Then participant randomly assign one five intervention group ( n = 30 ) : 1 ) heavy roll massage calf exhibit high tenderness ( Ipsi-R ) , 2 ) heavy roll massage contralateral calf ( Contra-R ) , 3 ) light stroke skin roller massager calf exhibit high tenderness ( Sham ) , 4 ) manual massage calf exhibit high tenderness ( Ipsi-M ) 5 ) intervention ( Control ) . Pain pressure threshold ( PPT ) measure 30 second 15 minute post-intervention via pressure algometer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In randomize , single blind , control trial study tender spot identify participant ` plantar flexor muscle ( gastrocnemius soleus ) . The acute effect different roller massage intervention PPT ( i.e . change PPT pre- post-intervention ) investigate . Participants inform intervention group . The registered massage therapist blind result pre- post-intervention measurement administer different mode massage . In addition , researcher record PPT value pre- post-intervention level blind mode intervention administer massage therapist . It show intra-day inter-day correlation algometry muscle tester range 0.88 0.99 0.94 0.98 , respectively . The CONSORT guideline follow throughout current research study . The study duration June October 2014 . Experimental protocol . Each participant attend lab one experimental session . The participant lay massage table prone position register massage therapist five year experience examine relaxed plantar flexor muscle identify tender spot . A tender spot identify area hyperirritable palpation pressure apply area pressure pain algometer ( approximately 4 kg/cm2 ) elicit localized pain great 5/10 visual analogue scale ( VAS ) . The VAS scale horizontal line anchor end indicate pain ( score 0 ) intolerable pain ( score 10 ) . The identified tender spot mark permanent marker spot exhibit high value chosen measurement . Then local tenderness ( dependent variable ) quantify ( massage therapist screen participant ) measure PPT use pressure pain algometer . The algometer ( Lafayette Manual Muscle Test System™ , Model 01163 , Lafayette Instrument Company , Indiana , USA ) hand-held muscle tester range 0-300 pound ( 136.1 kilogram ) consist padded disc surface area 1.7 cm2 attach microprocessor-control unit measure peak force ( pound kilogram ) . The unit digital readout peak-applied pressure provide built-in calibration routine verifies valid calibration . In order determine PPT , researcher would apply algometer tender spot participant calf muscle increase amount pressure participant verbally inform researcher sensation pressure become pain point algometer remove PPT value record . PPT value obtain every 5-10 second tender spot use pressure algometer PPT measure 6 time . Since post-intervention PPT measurement time sensitive , 6 PPT trial 5-10 second interval perform gain consistent value measurement . After completion pre-intervention PPT measurement , participant randomly ( use random number generator ) assign one five intervention group . The four massage intervention group ( Ipsi-R , Contra-R , Sham , Ipsi-M ) involve 3 set 30 second massage 30 second rest set . The registered massage therapist perform roller massage via Theraband® roller massager ( Hygienic Corporation , Akron , OH ) technique Ipsi-R , Contra-R Sham group . The roller massager consist hard rubber material ( 24 cm length 14 cm circumference ) low amplitude , longitudinal groove surround plastic cylinder . The participant instruct provide feedback level perceive pain heavy roll manual massage ( combination compression petrissage ) intensity massage would adjust accordingly ensure 7/10 visual analogue scale ( VAS ) maintain . The roller massager move proximal distal slow pace ( 2 second 2 second down ) muscle belly . Participants Sham group receive light pain-free cutaneous stroke roll massage pace roll perform Ipsi-R Contra-R group . The Control group receive treatment . They lay table prone position three minute post-intervention data collect . The Control group assign present study account potential confounding influence cutaneous touch Sham .</detailed_description>
