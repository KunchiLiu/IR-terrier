	<brief_summary>This study open label observational prospective study assess clinical efficacy antiTNFα therapy alteration/impact synovial tissue , specific regard lymphoid aggregation , period 12 month patient rheumatoid arthritis . Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) one important chronic inflammatory disorder UK . It affect approximately 1 % adults cause considerable morbidity , substantially reduce quality life significant mortality . It result large direct medical cost well extensive indirect social cost . Despite significant therapeutic progress follow introduction antiTNFα , cure RA still elusive . At present reason variation clinical response know . The main aim study test hypothesis distinct molecular cellular phenotype present within synovial tissue define specific disease subset provide characteristic prognostic implication . In particular , aim ass relationship presence ectopic lymphoneogenesis ( ELN ) within rheumatoid synovial membrane response antiTNFα therapy .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Men woman ≥ 18 ≤ 75 year age , RA define 1987 revised ACR classification criterion . Patients must fulfill National Institute Clinical Excellence guideline TNF Blocking Therapy RA . Patients must MTX least 4 month , stable dose 7.525 mg/week minimum 4 week . Men woman childbearing potential must use adequate birth control measure ( eg , abstinence , oral contraceptive , intrauterine device , barrier method spermicide , surgical sterilization ) duration study . Patients must able adhere study visit schedule . Patients must capable give informed consent consent must obtain prior screen procedure . Must chest Xray within 3 month prior commencement antiTNFα evidence malignancy , infection fibrosis . Women pregnant breast feeding . Use investigational drug within 1 month prior screen within 5 halflives investigational agent , whichever longer . Previous use antiTNF biologics . Treatment therapeutic agent target reduce TNF ( eg , pentoxifylline , thalidomide , etc . ) within 3 month screen . Serious infection ( , HIV , HBV , pneumonia pyelonephritis ) previous 3 month . Less serious infection ( acute upper respiratory tract infection [ cold ] simple urinary tract infection ) need consider exclusion discretion investigator . Have active TB evidence latent TB ( old latent TB chest Xray , without adequate therapy TB initiate prior first dose study drug ) . Also exclude patient evidence old latent TB infection without documented adequate therapy . Presence transplant organ ( exception corneal transplant &gt; 3 month prior screen ) . Malignancy within past 5 year ( except squamous basal cell carcinoma skin treat evidence recurrence ) . History lymphoproliferative disease include lymphoma , sign symptom suggestive possible lymphoproliferative disease , lymphadenopathy unusual size location ( nodes posterior triangle neck , infraclavicular , epitrochlear , periaortic area ) , splenomegaly . Known recent substance abuse ( drug alcohol ) . Poor tolerability venepuncture require blood sample study period .</criteria>
