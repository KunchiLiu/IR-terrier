	<brief_summary>Malaria protozoan infection transmit anopheline mosquito . The severe form cause Plasmodium ( P ) falciparum much less extent P. vivax . Although interest research malaria increase last year , yet little research conduct `` neglected '' malaria specie P. ovale P. malariae . P. ovale first described 1922 , still remain unclear whether display dormant pre-erythrocytic liver stage , call hypnozoites , . Primaquine , market drug liver stage activity present , cause severe hemolysis glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase ( G6PD ) deficient person methemoglobinemia . Because G6PD widely spread Central Africa , important explore whether additional intake liver-active medication really need account research investigate new treatment option liver stage activity conduct . While , due widespread resistance , treatment recommendation P. falciparum mixed infection switch chloroquine safer applicable artemisinin-based combination therapy ( ACTs ) , World Health Organization ( WHO ) guideline still suggest chloroquine first line treatment P. malariae P. ovale mono infection . Further study assess alternative treatment option largely miss . Summing current situation topic show need research . Therefore study aim assess evidence characterize frequency relapse P. ovale infection respect difference subspecies well effectiveness ACT artemether-lumefantrine P. malariae P. ovale mono- mixed infection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Although P. ovale hypnozoites never demonstrate biological experiment finding literature relapse controversial , 14 day primaquine standard therapy recommend every patient suffer P. ovale infection . As clear evidence relapse P. ovale importance conclusively analyze clinical evidence relapse potential evaluate necessity anti-relapse treatment option . Moreover , summarize actual situation show need evaluation clinical use ACTs non-falciparum infection : - Firstly , molecular diagnostic method indicate P. malariae P. ovale prevalent previously think . In many setting malaria treat clinical suspicion . Diagnosis microscopy difficult parasitemia low differentiation specie require experience . This lead assumption P. malariae P. ovale infection already blindly treated common ACTs recommend P. falciparum malaria . The evaluation artemisinin base combination therapy non-falciparum malaria therefore essential . - Secondly , combination therapy proven protective emergence resistant parasites Asia combination therapy could even reduce resistance . As chloroquine-resistant P. malariae parasite report , combination therapy implement order stop emergence spread resistance . Additionally , artemisinins , contrast chloroquine , reduce transmissibility gametocytocidal activity . A uniform treatment algorithm four Plasmodium specie would simplify facilitate treatment malaria . With reduction chloroquine use setting poor quality diagnosis , risk fatal treatment failure due wrongly administer chloroquine chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum would decrease . Finally , 8-aminoquinoline treatment necessary P. ovale infection , could improve safety compliance treatment . The study design open label prospective study within group design . Patients enrol receive oral artemether-lumefantrine tablet 6 dose regimen 3 consecutive day ( Day 0 , 1 2 ) . Dosage depend patient 's weight accord manufacturer recommendation . Patients follow 42 day . If P. ovale diagnose baseline , one-year follow-up conduct every second week . Parasite density , express number parasite per microliter ( µl ) blood , measure regularly determine parasite clearance time ( PCT ) . Blood smear preparation , stain , examination interpretation do accord Lambaréné method . Thick thin blood film parasite count specie diagnosis obtain examine screen D0 confirm inclusion/exclusion criterion . Thick blood film examine every 24h follow first dose administration parasite clear . Thick thin blood film also examine Days 7 , 14 , 21 , 28 , 35 42 day patient spontaneously return . For participant P. ovale infection baseline , read thick thin blood film continue every second week one year . In case reappearance parasite , Coartem administer Follow-up continue schedule . Diagnosis P. ovale effect PCR . Furthermore , genotyping study use differentiate new infection relapse recrudescence confirm microscopic diagnosis specie . Plasma sample collect stored pharmacokinetic analysis 7 day treatment initiation . To determine efficacy clinically , body temperature clinical sign symptom malaria assess . Safety assessment include physical examination , vital sign hematology . Adverse Events Serious Adverse Events ascertain . The investigator / staff notify Independent Ethics Committee Serious Adverse Events soon possible accordance local regulation .</detailed_description>
