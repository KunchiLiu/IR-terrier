	<brief_summary>The aim study compare cardiovascular respiratory effect `` high '' versus `` equivalent '' CPAP pressure post-extubation high endotracheal airway pressure ( EAP ) , define least 8 cm H2O ( water ) , form randomize control cross-over trial . Endotracheal airway pressure ( EAP ) define mean airway pressure ( MAP ) [ high frequency ventilation ] positive end-expiratory pressure ( PEEP ) [ conventional ventilation ] time extubation . Participants randomize `` high '' CPAP group ( CPAP level 2cm H2O high extubation EAP ) `` equivalent '' CPAP group ( CPAP level equal extubation EAP ) undergo crossover arm . We hypothesize `` high '' CPAP level , compare `` equivalent '' CPAP level , adversely impact cardiorespiratory status patient extubated high EAP .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Extubation readiness enrol infant determine solely discretion medical team . All enrol infant check re-confirm eligibility prior extubation . Those enrolled infant ventilate EMV ( endotracheal mechanical ventilation ) airway pressure 8-11 cm H2O time deem extubation-ready team eligible randomization . Once eligibility randomization assess , study coordinator notify research team immediately perform bedside functional echocardiography ass cardiac output PDA ( patent ductus arteriosus ) status . In addition , lung compliance ( measure ventilator ) record . If PDA exist find hemodynamically significant , infant meet one exclusion criterion ineligible randomization . Once eligibility confirm , infant randomize use sequentially number seal opaque envelope . The sequence randomization pre-determined use computer generate algorithm , seal envelope create study coordinator . Once randomize , infant extubated `` high '' CPAP group ( CPAP level 2cm H2O high extubation EAP ) `` equivalent '' CPAP group ( CPAP level equal extubation EAP ) base allocation . After ensure infant stable one hour ( base pre-defined clinical instability criterion ) cardiac output measure use bedside functional echocardiography member research team blind allocation . To ensure blind research coordinator cover relevant digital display ventilator/CPAP machine ( opaque craft paper tape ) immediately prior echocardiography . Other aforementioned outcome record blind investigator use standardize data collection form . Once outcome data collect , infant cross-over opposite arm trial similar assessment protocol follow one hour . The study protocol consider complete second set measurement obtain respiratory management guide medical team . SAFETY ASSURANCE At point study , emergence one clinical instability criterion prompt nursing staff notify medical team would immediately assess infant . If infant show sign clinical instability medical team evaluate infant ' clinical condition per pre-defined checklist . When troubleshoot point mention checklist address medical team infant deem clinically unstable , infant would immediately remove study protocol parent subject notify . To ensure factor affect hemodynamic status infant study , total fluid intake would remain caffeine citrate would administer period pre post extubation assessment cardiac output .</detailed_description>
