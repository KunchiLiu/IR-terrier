	<detailed_description>During July 2010 July 2013 COPD patient two health-administrative area ( integrate sanitary organization -ISO- ) Bizkaia recruit . Each two area support 1 hospital . Hospital Galdakao-Usansolo hospital ( ISO-Barrualde ) , charge health 350000 inhabitant second , hospital Cruces ( OSI-Ezkerraldea Cruces ) 350000 inhabitant . The cohort Galdakao intervention cohort cohort Cruces control cohort . Both cohort followed-up two year . Participants The inclusion criterion establish : COPD ( COPD confirm post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume one second ( FEV1 ) divide force vital capacity le 0.7 ( FEV1/FVC &lt; 70 % ) admit least twice previous year three time two previous year COPD exacerbation ( eCOPD ) . Exclusion criteria another significant respiratory disease , active neoplasm , terminal clinical situation , inability carry measurement project , unwillingness take part study . With requirement , patient choose database hospital . The potential candidate career inform program general informative meeting , individually admission , invited participate . If patient want take part program sign informed consent form . Usual clinical care At time study COPD patient take part specific clinical control program public health system . Patients control follow schedule primary doctor respiratory specialist . The frequency control depend severity disease . In case eCOPD schedule visit primary doctor . Intervention The patient present stable COPD , least six week enrollment . All participant previous spirometry COPD diagnosis confirm moment inclusion program . The program consist : 1 ) Educational program COPD ( general information COPD , general treatment disease focus tobacco inhaled medication , life healthy habit alarm sign relate eCOPD ) . This educational program carried-out respiratory nurse two 30-minute speech patient career , inclusion program 1 year later . 2 ) Training use device ( smart phone ) support telemonitoring . 3 ) Daily phone call make self-confident patient first week . Afterwards phone call establish accord capacity patient manage . Generally speak two year program every phone call patient give advice daily healthy habit , specially physical activity . Written information program ran use smart phone well contact phone number provide every patient career . No home visit part program . No self-management plan exacerbation include program . The implementation program previously explain primary doctor two general meeting . The program support specialized respiratory nurse , work hospital Galdakao-Usansolo full timer two part-time respiratory physician work program Monday Friday . During even weekend centralize call-center ( non specialize respiratory nurse ) charge program . The device smart phone specific software program , include measurement physiological variable temperature , breath rate , oxygen saturation , heart rate steps/day ) clinical questionnaire ( characteristic cough sputum , level dyspnea general clinical health status ) . Patients included program ( telEPOC program ) send information clinical situation daily basis . This daily information send secure internet connection protect server transfer respiratory service , nurse analyzed whole information every patient . Every patient tailored-made baseline level measurement establish stable clinical situation moment inclusion program . This baseline reference daily measurement . Once patientÂ´s measurement receive , automatically order three color level ( traffic light ) depend deviation measurement respect baseline measurement ( alarm ) . The alarm three level establish consensus research team depend different combination measurement daily sent patient . Once patient measurement receive , several possible action . If data normal respect personalize threshold previously establish , single action do . If establish threshold surpass , alarm activate protocol action plan start . The first step phone call patient career . This phone call use confirm alarm level priority try solve long possible . If action consider useful solve alarm nurse two option , depend severity alarm , wait daily evaluation patient bi respiratory physician ( ward daily round ) contact one respiratory physician . At point respiratory physician determine patient sent primary doctor evaluate respiratory specialist send hospital emergency department . If patient evaluate doctor primary level specialize level , nurse program previously contact doctor arrange appointment . An alert system warn monitor team daily measurement submit . Primary outcome : The primary outcome program diminish rate hospitalization eCOPD . We define exacerbation sustain worsen participant 's COPD symptom usual stable state beyond normal day-to-day variation , severity level need hospital admission solve . Control cohort . The control group follow usual care protocol health system . That include periodic control primary respiratory specialist . They receive non-structured information/education COPD follow program control agenda depend severity disease every 4-6 month . Generally speak difference two cohort educational structured program telemonitoring control . Baseline assessment The study protocol perform intervention control cohort include several measurement include program every year follow-up . Sociodemographic variable smoke habit record . The level dyspnea establish use modify Medical Research Council score [ 10 ] . Comorbidities determine review patient ' medical record clinical history Charlson Comorbidity Index calculate . Health related quality life ( HRQoL ) assess use Spanish validate version Saint George 's Respiratory Questionnaire ( SGRQ ) COPD Assessment Test ( CAT ) . London Chest Activity Daily Living scale questionnaire ( LCADL ) . Anxiety Depression measure HAD questionnaire . Complete pulmonary function test include forced spirometry , bronchodilator test , body plethysmography , carbon monoxide diffuse capacity , respiratory muscle strength . Theoretical value establish European Community Steel Coal . Two 6-minute walking test perform accord ATS guideline . The intervention group daily use pedometer . Follow-up In control cohort every year follow-up period , survivor interview underwent previously describe measurement . No others intervention perform related study , research team take part patient ' routine treatment treatment exacerbation . In every visit , review medical report examine hospital database hospitalization determine . Data collection Data hospitalization emergency department admission collect real time patient train notify circumstance daily follow-up permit know situation every patient every moment . Moreover patient send daily data system generate alarm result phone call nurse know reason information sent . Besides , every patient review hospital emergency department admission carry end every year . The questionnaire pulmonary function test exercise capacity perform every year .</detailed_description>
