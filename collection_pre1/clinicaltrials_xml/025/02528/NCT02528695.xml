	<brief_summary>The metabolic function different white adipose tissue depot body role development type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) remain unclear . Several study use fluor-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography compute tomography ( FDG PET/CT ) image metabolic activity different adipose tissue lean obese healthy subject patient T2D without euglycaemic hyperinsulinemic clamping , describe difference metabolic activity visceral adipose tissue ( VAT ) , subcutaneous adipose tissue ( SAT ) gluteal-femoral adipose tissue ( GFAT ) . Recently , FDG PET/CT show high glucose uptake VAT SAT unintentional hypoglycaemic condition non-diabetic patient . Evaluation potential difference FDG uptake white adipose tissue healthy volunteer T2D patient VAT , SAT GFAT subject hyperinsulinemic hypoglycaemic condition would great value explore pathogenesis insulin resistance T2D .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Type 2 diabetes become worldwide epidemic prevalence approximately 700,000 patient annual incidence 70,000 Netherlands . The development T2D depend genetic nutritional factor characterize insufficient insulin secretion pancreatic beta-cells insulin resistance liver , skeletal muscle white adipose tissue . Insulin resistance often precede beta-cell loss associate central obesity , high blood pressure , hyperinsulinemia dyslipidemia , may lead microvascular cardiovascular complication . White adipose tissue increasingly consider key metabolic organ development insulin resistance . Especially distribution adipose tissue body important . Indeed , visceral adipose tissue risk factor coronary heart disease , certain cancer T2D associate increase cardiovascular all-cause mortality , whereas excess subcutaneous adipose tissue . There distinct difference functional hormonal characteristic VAT SAT , may explain part mechanism underlie development insulin resistance . A complete understanding molecular mechanism lead T2D enable identification individual high risk , could lead target prevention pharmacological therapy . FDG PET/CT establish tomographic technique image glucose metabolism validate application oncology , infectious inflammatory disease , brain metabolism cardiac viability . Several study explore usefulness FDG PET image glucose metabolism white adipose tissue report low overall glucose uptake obese lean subject . In subject group , glucose uptake high VAT SAT . Glucose uptake VAT SAT inversely related insulin resistance , uptake GFAT . There study analyze glucose uptake patient T2D FDG PET/CT . In one study impact abdominal obesity newly diagnose T2D insulin action adipose tissue evaluate , suggest excess SAT provide sink glucose , thereby result compensatory decrease insulin resistance . More research need demonstrate difference glucose uptake various adipose tissue depot patient T2D correlate insulin resistance . In order keep glucose constant level FDG PET examination , usually hyperinsulinemic euglycaemic glucose clamp perform scan . Recently , case-report publish describe FDG PET/CT iatrogenic hypoglycemic state non-diabetic patient , demonstrate remarkably increase glucose uptake VAT SAT . Based observation hypothesize glucose uptake hypoglycaemic state pronounce various adipose tissue depot . To knowledge , perform healthy volunteer patient T2D . A control hypoglycemic state may achieve hyperinsulinemic hypoglycaemic clamp , use several clinical study . A demonstration difference FDG uptake white adipose tissue healthy volunteer T2D patient VAT , SAT GFAT hypoglycaemic condition would provide insight glucose metabolism adipose tissue contribute understand insulin resistance T2D . Even importantly , image technique might help good characterise patient T2D patient risk develop T2D , may thereby help increase understanding pathophysiology T2D metabolic syndrome , could lead targeted prevention patient risk personalised pharmacological therapy onset clinically overt disease .</detailed_description>
