	<brief_title>Understanding Methotrexate Induced Gastrointestinal Intolerance Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis Childhood Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Childhood leukemia ( Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia , ALL ) frequent malignancy pediatric population ( 1 ) . Survival rate reach 85 % due advance chemotherapy . High-dose methotrexate ( MTX ) mainstay treatment ALL ( 2-4 ) . Gastrointestinal toxicity well know challenge associate high-dose MTX treatment ( 5 ) . However described significant problem among child reach maintenance treatment receive low-dose MTX treatment . Children Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis ( JIA ) also receive low-dose MTX treatment . Among patient MTX induce gastrointestinal intolerance significant problem . Studies show half JIA patient problem tolerate MTX nausea may lead cessation treatment ( 6,7 ) . It largely unknown MTX cause nausea pharmacogenetic psychological factor think play role ( 8 ) . JIA common chronic pediatric rheumatic disease . Without treatment disease cause significant short- long-term disability quality life impairment . Prognosis greatly improve within recent year result substantial progress disease management MTX mainstay treatment JIA ( 9-13 ) . The aim project create great understanding MTX induce gastrointestinal intolerance among child leukemia child JIA . The project focus nausea investigate level nausea two patient group compare difference exist . The investigator investigate pharmacogenetic psychological factor relation patient ' level nausea . Pharmacogenetic background : MTX absorb gastrointestinal tract transport bloodstream transporter proteins enterocytes . Elimination MTX primarily renal percentage MTX pass enterohepatic circulation first ( 14,15 ) . Studies use high-dose MTX treatment child ALL suggest fast hepatic clearance MTX increase degree gastrointestinal toxicity . It show patient mutation ( Single Nucleotide Peptides , SNPs ) gene encode hepatic transporter protein SLCO1B1 , responsible transport MTX liver , less gastrointestinal toxicity high-dose MTX ( 16 ) . The transporter protein encode SLC19A1 place liver enterocytes ( 15 ) . Studies adult patient diagnose either psoriasis rheumatoid arthritis treat low-dose MTX , study ALL patient high-dose MTX show SLC19A1 associate concentration MTX plasma erythrocytes well MTX-related toxicity ( 1,17-20 ) . Transporter proteins transport MTX liver bile duct encode ABCC2 ABCB1 ( 15 ) . Studies adult patient rheumatoid arthritis low-dose MTX , adult Chronic Myeloid Leukemia study ALL patient high-dose MTX show gene pharmacokinetically important ABCC2 show associated MTX-related gastrointestinal toxicity ( 5,21-24 ) . Previous study patient rheumatoid arthritis , childhood leukemia JIA show frequency clinically relevant SNPs gene encode MTX-related transporter protein : SLCO1B1 ( 70.3 % ) , ABCB1 ( 20.6 % ) , ABCC2 ( 56.8 % ) , SLC19A1 ( 31 % ) ( 5,16,17,19,21,25-28 ) .The investigator therefore believe conceivable find select genetic polymorphism MTX-related transporter protein participate study population . Pharmocogenetic Aims : Investigate MTX-related gastrointestinal intolerance associate enterohepatic circulation . Specifically , determine SNPs gene encode MTX-related liver transporter protein associate level drug induce gastrointestinal side effect . Pharmacogenetic Hypotheses : Patients SNPs gene encode MTX-related transporter protein liver low level enterohepatic circulation MTX thus low level nausea patient . Psychological Background : Studies adult cancer patient show psychologically base nausea occur treatment chemotherapy possible explanation nausea proportion medicine 's emetogenic potential . It also possible explanation great variation level cancer patient ' nausea type chemotherapy ( 29,30 ) . Studies child chemotherapy different cancer show psychological factor , cop strategy anxiety , affect degree chemotherapy associate nausea vomit ( 31-33 ) . The investigator want investigate also case child leukemia maintenance treatment low-dose MTX well JIA patient low-dose MTX-treatment . Psychological aim : To investigate nausea-coping strategy anxiety level study population associate degree MTX-induced gastrointestinal intolerance . And investigate difference two patient group . Psychological hypothesis : Insufficient psychological coping strategy high level anxiety may cause psychologically base nausea . Thus patient high level anxiety insufficient cop strategy higher degree nausea MTX treatment patient . Perspectives This project contribute great understand MTX-induced intolerance child leukemia JIA . This also beneficial child receive low-dose MTX treatment . The project optimize maintenance treatment childhood leukemia treatment JIA use patient SNP genotype determine tolerate MTX . Additionally , identify patient psychological intervention may diminish MTX-induced nausea . Materials methods The study population comprises : 1 . Children diagnose ALL maintenance treatment 2 . Children diagnose JIA accord ILAR criterion For inclusion/exclusion criterion see `` Eligibility Criteria '' . For patient list disease specific characteristic note . The level MTX-induced intolerance determine electronic `` nausea-diary '' four week , contain `` face nausea scale '' base `` face pain scale '' ( 34 ) . The gastrointestinal side effect evaluate Methotrexate-Intolerance-Severity-Score questionnaire ( MISS ) ( 35 ) . Pharmacogenetic method : Blood sample patient use determine prevalence SNPs gene encode MTX-related transporter protein ( gene include : SLCO1B1 , SLC19A1 , ABCC2 , ABCB1 ) . The genetic analysis perform Institute Biomedicine , Aarhus University . Genotyping carry use Sequenom MassARRAY Genotyping system ( Sequenom , San Diego , CA ) . In brief multiplex PCR perform 5 μl reaction contain 10 ng genomic DNA , 1.25 x PCR buffer , 0.5 mM dNTP , 100nM primer 0.5U Taq polymerase use standard cycling condition . The PCR product treat SAP probe extension reaction ( iPLEX ) carry accord iPLEX standard protocol ( Sequenom ) . The desalted sample analyze use Bruker matrix assist laser desorption/ionization-time flight ( MALDI-TOF ) mass spectrometer ( Sequenom ) genotype determine use MassARRAY Typer 3.4 software ( Sequenom ) . The blood sample also use measure concentration MTX-polyglutamates erythrocyte ( Ery-MTX-PG ) . The measurement Ery-MTX-PG perform HPLC-technique child 's oncology lab , Rigshospitalet , Copenhagen , Denmark . 2 ) Psychological method : The patient ' cop strategy investigate use nausea-coping-questionnaire developed pain-coping questionnaire , specifically developed child previously translate Danish , validate use early study . It consist eight subscales main cop strategy : Information seek , problem solving , seek social support , positive self-statements , behavioral distraction , cognitive distraction , externalize internalizing/catastrophizing ( 36,37,39,40 ) . The patient ' level anxiety assess `` Beck Youth Inventories '' ( BYI ) , previously translate Danish validate . The BYI brief easy use . It consist 20 sentence investigate fear , worry physiological symptom associate anxiety ( 38 ) . Statistics Power calculation : This base primary target measure ( degree nausea ) quantify `` face nausea scale '' nausea diary . The scale end point : `` nausea '' `` extreme nausea '' , number 0 5 . Results earlier study use face pain scale show mean score 0.74 ( SD=0.70 ) 0.91 ( SD=0.86 ) ( 36 ) . From clinical assessment investigator expect mean nausea score group JIA patient 2.5 1 ALL patient . The standard deviation expect similar study ( SD=0.9 ) . If level significance ( alpha ) 0.05 , power 80 % ratio group size 2 , calculate size study population 10 patient JIA group 5 ALL group . If mean nausea score 2 group JIA patient , still 1 group ALL patient , standard deviation great expect , SD=2 . But alpha still 0.05 , power 80 % , ratio group size still 2 . Then calculate size study population 96 patient JIA group 48 ALL group . Research Plan The research group consist : From Department Pediatrics , Aarhus University Hospital Skejby : Main applicant : Nini Kyvsgaard Brix Nørgaard , PhD-student ( enrol Aarhus University ) , M.D . Main supervisor : Troels Herlin , Professor , DMSc ; Co-supervisor : Torben Stamm Mikkelsen , MD , PhD . From Institute Biomedicine , Aarhus University : Co-supervisor : Thomas Juhl Corydon , Associate Professor , PhD , Deputy Head Institute Biomedicine , Aarhus University . From Institute Psychology , Aarhus University : Co-Supervisor : Mikael Thastum , Professor , PhD , Head Clinical Psychology , Aarhus University . The PhD-student perform coordinate daily execution project guidance group supervisor . The first second year project dedicate collection patient data blood sample . Firstly , inclusion JIA patient commence . Then inclusion ALL patient . The third year dedicate analysis gene polymorphisms MTX level , data analysis compilation manuscript publication . The research group extensive research experience clinical expertise within area . Feasibility The laboratory facility take blood sample carry initial handling available . The final analysis perform specify 'pharmacogenetic method ' . The investigator access software perform questionnaires electronically , well access statistical support .</detailed_description>
