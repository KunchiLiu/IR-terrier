	<brief_summary>This pilot study hypothesize hyperthermia deliver via magnetic resonance-guided focus ultrasound ( MRg-FU ) technically feasible safely use combination concurrent reirradiation chemotherapy treatment recurrent rectal cancer . Twenty recurrent rectal cancer patient candidate surgery recruit hyperthermia treatment deliver via MRg-FU concurrent reirradiation oral chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Magnetic Resonance-Guided High Intensity Focused Ultrasound Recurrent Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Magnetic resonance-guided focus ultrasound ( MRg-FU ) non-invasive , outpatient modality investigate thermal treatment cancer . In MRg-FU , specially design transducer use focus beam low intensity ultrasound energy small volume specific target site body . MR use identify delineate tumour , focus ultrasound beam target provide real-time thermal mapping ensure accurate heating designate target minimal effect adjacent healthy tissue . The focused ultrasound beam produce therapeutic hyperthermia ( 40-42°C ) target field cause protein denaturation cell damage . Currently , prospective clinical data report use MRg-FU setting recurrent rectal cancer . Recurrent rectal cancer vex clinical problem . Current retreatment protocol limit efficacy . The addition hyperthermia radiation chemotherapy may enhance therapeutic response . With recent advance technology , investigator hypothesize MRg-FU technically feasible safely use combination concurrent reirradiation chemotherapy treatment recurrent rectal cancer without increase side-effects .</detailed_description>
