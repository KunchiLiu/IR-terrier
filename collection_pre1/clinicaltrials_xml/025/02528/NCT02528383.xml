	<detailed_description>Breast cancer make different subtypes far common characteristic estrogen receptor positivity . Seventy percent breast cancer estrogen receptor positive therefore responsive hormone estrogen , act stimulus growth survival cancer . Studies repeatedly show estrogen deprivation result prevention breast cancer high-risk woman , reduce recurrence cancer locally systemically well overall survival improvement woman .

The investigator also propose use topical vaginal estrogen application ( one commercially available ) carefully monitor ' effect locally vagina possible impact bone health . The investigator expect woman improve vaginal exam well improvement overall quality life treatment . It also expect impact bone turnover topical estrogen replacement . Postmenopausal woman aromatase inhibitor interested study participation ask participate three month period .</detailed_description>
