	<detailed_description>Study Abstract Group B Streptococcus ( GBS ) lead cause neonatal morbidity mortality Canada . It may pass study participant colonize genital tract GBS baby vaginal birth . While approximately 10 30 % pregnant people harbour GBS vagina rectum , incidence neonatal GBS disease 1 2 infant per 1000 birth . The use intrapartum antibiotic treat colonized individual without risk factor lead 70 % decline incidence early-onset GBS sepsis past decade . Despite impressive decline , antibiotic resistance become major public health concern . Association intrapartum antibiotic use ampicillin resistance E. coli isolate neonate previously document . Furthermore , GBS remain sensitive penicillin , 20 % resistant erythromycin clindamycin , alternate drug patient allergic penicillin . Alternative approach therefore need reduce risk GBS infection . We therefore propose study use Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 Lactobacillus reuteri RC-14 ( Lactobacillus fermentum RC-14 ) colonization status GBS pregnant people . Lactobacilli part normal gut vaginal flora widely use probiotic treat various condition . In particular , two strain show beneficial treatment urinary tract infection bacterial vaginosis . Our study design involve recruit two hundred pregnant people ( one hundred arm ) various midwifery practice GTA end first trimester pregnancy . These individual randomize receive probiotic placebo twelve week pregnancy culture delivery determine colonization status . The capsule probiotic placebo provide free charge . The study design choose minimize cost client ' visit clinic vaginal/rectal swab routinely offer 35-37 week gestation . As lactobacilli part human gut flora low pathogenicity , adverse reaction lactobacillus placebo anticipate , though client may experience flatulence . The process reporting unexpected adverse event outline Case Report Form ( CRF ) . Concerns relate integration study practice midwives community mitigate letter information midwives client , informed choice discussion researcher study participant , letter consent . Background Group B Streptococcus ( GBS ) gram-positive bacterium . The gut bodily reservoir GBS , likely source vaginal colonization . While part normal vaginal flora usually noticeable consequence people , GBS emerge 1970s lead cause neonatal morbidity mortality . A primary risk factor neonatal contraction colonization carrier 's vaginal tract , bacteria pass baby travel birth canal , spread amniotic fluid . This vertical transmission lead early-onset GBS disease newborn ( EOGBSD ) , manifest first 7 day life , fatal . Therefore , current clinical recommendation focus prevention GBS-associated disease monitor manage GBS colonization status pregnant person attempt reduce probability neonate contract GBS infection birth . Currently , midwives Ontario advise offer client culture screen GBS 35-37 week gestation . People screen positive GBS offer intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis ( IAP ) either universally , base risk factor . IAP specifically recommend reasonably expect GBS-free ( i.e . screen negative GBS test 35-37 week ) . While EOGBSD potentially serious , use IAP associated risk . Concomitant use IAP risk : maternal anaphylaxis , emergence antibiotic-resistant strain bacteria , infection non-GBS organism , colonization yeast , development allergy asthma . In addition , IAP require client labour attach IV various time-points throughout labour , IAP disruption natural course labour delivery midwife try facilitate . Furthermore , GBS screen positive status stressful people . Therefore , attempt eliminate stress , need IAP risk inconvenience associate , midwife offer certain strategy client attempt reduce probability screen positive GBS bacteria . Homeopathy , garlic suppository , probiotic capsule method midwife client use attempt prevent vaginal colonization GBS . However , evidence support refute use remedy . Probiotics define viable microbial food supplement , give adequate quantity , confer health benefit host . Bacteria lactobacillus sp . common probiotic capsule preparation , also common type organism find natural vaginal flora . The natural vaginal flora play important role dislodge inhibit pathogen . The rationale use probiotic , return vaginal flora healthy , natural state . Indeed , probiotic show alter vaginal flora effective supplement treatment cure bacterial vaginosis , vulvovaginal yeast infection . Probiotic capsule consider safe use pregnancy . Research Question Does take probiotic 12 week pregnancy effect GBS colonization status people 35-37 week pregnancy ? Study Design Probiotic Capsules L. rhamnosus GR-1 L. reuteri RC-14 supply pregnant people gelatin capsule contain 2.5 billion viable cell strain ( CFU ) . These organism previously show colonize vagina take orally displace pathogen cause bacterial vaginosis vaginal yeast infection , show effective treatment , accessory treatment condition . This formulation previously approve use clinical trial Canada . The probiotic placebo provide gelatin capsule . The use gelatin capsule may prohibitive individual vegetarian , vegan , Muslim Jewish . Subjects &amp; Randomization This randomize , placebo-controlled trial . In order achieve 80 % statistical power p value 0.05 assumption 20 % people placebo group become GBS positive , 200 client recruit participate midwifery clinic Greater Toronto Area randomize study arm ( 2 group 100 ) . Clients offer entry study upon begin midwifery care , provide either oral Lactobacillus GR-1 RC-14 placebo ( cellulose , magnesium stearate ) . Two capsule take daily 12 week 24 week pregnancy GBS swab test take 35-37 week pregnancy , routine standard midwifery care . Relevance The hope study shed light utility probiotic midwifery care pertain GBS colonization . This study may provide evidence probiotic prophylaxis effective , low-risk strategy continue offer client reduce risk GBS colonization thus , need IAP risk inconvenience associate . Alternatively , study provide evidence probiotic efficacious supplement offer , recommend , capsule quite costly purchase , decision-making process around whether obtain capsule , may place undue hardship people . Safety Adverse Event Monitoring It investigators mandate protect safety study participant . The possibility adverse event use placebo probiotic extremely minimal . Participants inform small chance experience flatulence capsule . Any unexpected adverse event report immediately participant midwife , document Case Report Form ( CRF ) notify Practice Research Collaborator ( PRC ) clinic . The PRC would notify PI delegate investigation . As study participant direct care midwife aware study client 's participation study , midwives manage , consult , transfer care accord College guideline event unexpected adverse event . The PRC PI delegate responsible document AEs CRF . The PI , collaboration QI Co-I , applicable , determine severity AE causality . Severe AEs reportable REB Health Canada . Study participant experience unexpected , adverse , severe adverse event consider exclusion study .</detailed_description>
