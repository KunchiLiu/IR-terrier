	<detailed_description>This prospective observational study nociceptin level draw patient 's serum well patient 's synovial fluid . The blood draw complete anesthesia team synovial fluid tissue obtain orthopedic team . The initial blood draw preoperative area second blood draw five minute release tourniquet . The synovial fluid drawn surgeon first incision . There randomization control group . Endpoints : 1 . The level absence nociceptin synovial fluid patient receive total knee primary arthroplasty measure via ELISA picograms per volume . 2 . The level absence nociceptin plasma patient receive total knee primary arthroplasty preoperative period ( less 1 hour prior surgery 5 minute tourniquet remove ) via ELISA picograms per volume . 3 . Determine change nociception plasma level perioperative course patient receive total primary knee arthroplasty . Secondary Study Endpoints : 1 . Determine effect present history chronic pain opioid use level nociception present patient ' synovial fluid plasma receive primary total knee arthroplasty . 2 . Determine effect present demographic factor level nociception present patient ' synovial fluid plasma receive primary total knee arthroplasty</detailed_description>
