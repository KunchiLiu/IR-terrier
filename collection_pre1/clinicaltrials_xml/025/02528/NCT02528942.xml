	<brief_title>Feasibility Study Incorporating Lung Function Imaging Into Radiation Therapy Lung Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study plan learn radiation therapy . Radiation therapy one main treatment use treat lung cancer . One known side effect radiation therapy scar lung reduce lung function result shortness breath . At time radiation treatment plan take account difference lung function one part lung another . Studies show lung function vary substantially throughout lung . This study aim plan radiation therapy away high functioning portion lung still deliver intend radiation dose tumor . This study allow researcher determine whether take lung function information account design radiation treatment plan protect lung function radiation therapy .</detailed_description>
