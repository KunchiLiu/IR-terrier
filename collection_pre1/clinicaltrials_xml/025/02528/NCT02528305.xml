	<brief_title>The Effect HIT Patients With Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease/Steatohepatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study aim recruit 12 patient diagnose non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) liver clinic Ninewells Hospital , Dundee . Suitable patient give informed consent assess baseline , 6 week intervention act control period , thirdly 6 week twice-weekly high-intensity interval training ( HIT ) . Assessments perform patient fasted overnight , involve body composition measurement , blood pressure , venous blood sample circulate triglyceride , fast glucose , insulin , liver enzymes alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) , platelet . An oral glucose tolerance test perform use fingerprick capillary sample . Cognitive function test episodic memory , executive function semantic memory perform questionnaire ( SF-36 ) use assess general well-being . Physical fitness assess 12-minute walk test treadmill , allow estimation maximal oxygen uptake capacity ( VO2 max ) , `` get go '' test use assess physical function . The exercise intervention involve 2 minute warm-up , cycle 50 rpm participant ask cycle 100rpm weight add ( 7 % body weight men 6 % body weight woman ) resistance . The sprint last 6 second participant ask rest least 1 minute . This repeat total 5 sprint session 1-3 , 6 sprint session 4 , 7 sprint session 5 &amp; 6 , 8 sprint session 7 &amp; 8 , 9 sprint session 9 &amp; 10 10 sprint session 11 &amp; 12 . Exercise heart rate monitor record . At least 3 day last HIT session pre-intervention test assessment repeat third time . Changes measure variable analyse via repeat measure analysis variance ( ANOVA ) post-hoc test variable .</detailed_description>
