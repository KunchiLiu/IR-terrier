	<detailed_description>Binge-eating disorder recently include Diagnostic Statistical Manual , 5th Edition , recognize serious public health problem . Binge-eating disorder associate obesity psychiatric comorbidities , include depression , may predictive metabolic syndrome . Many patient undertreated despite functional impairment personal social difficulty lead poor quality life .

Therefore , additional clinical trial need identify effective pharmacotherapies . Consuming food necessary life involve brain region quite ancient evolutionary term . The intestinal tract almost like `` second brain '' contains vast amount neuron use transmit process sensory information ; indeed intestinal tract contain neurotransmitter serotonin brain . Peripheral signal body ( include intestinal tract , also blood stream - e.g . glucose level ) transmit brain region hypothalamic nuclei help regulate appetite/hunger maintain equilibrium . Another key aspect circuitry involve eat involves brain reward system , include nucleus accumbens , regulate neurotransmitter dopamine , opioids , noradrenaline , serotonin . In human , less degree animal , also top-down control prefrontal cortex , serve regulate behavior suppress tendency crave reward , allow u flexibly adapt behavior rather get stuck repetitive habit . Thus , binge-eating likely involve dysregulation three domain regulate behavior : primitive 'peripheral-hypothalamic ' feedback system , reward circuitry , top-down control circuitry . On neurochemical level , binge eating may relate dysfunction serotonergic , dopamine , glutamatergic , norepinephrine system . Thus , medication target binge eat need multi-modal term pharmacology .</detailed_description>
