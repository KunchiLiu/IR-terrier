	<brief_summary>Prospective , interventional study pharmacokinetic ( PK ) -focused FVIII dose discussion deliver part patient education package . The study capture severe haemophilia A patient report outcome measure PK-focused dosing discussion , include standardised patient education package , include personalise PK-guided dosing suggestion computational predictive device ( myPKFiT® ) . The pragmatic study design recognise CE mark myPKFiT® device implement routine care nationally consequently require single additional clinic visit purpose consenting .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>National Study Pharmacokinetic-Focused Educational Package Patients With Severe Haemophilia A</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There paucity patient report outcome data document impact PK focus prophylaxis discussion . This prospective , multicentre UK-PK trial coincide initiation myPKFiT® device context enhance clinical review . This include standardised patient education package use short animate film explain PK personalise prophylaxis , follow model patient 's PK use myPKFiT® device discuss dose option patient . The aim PK educational package educate engage patient ensure treatment regimen meet individual need . In addition , study capture prophylaxis dose strategy agree upon patient clinical team treatment decision make jointly patient clinical team ( concordance ) . Looking forward , haemophilia clinical care team member need marker judge predict patient engagement personalise medicine process . Successful consultation strategy may differ team anticipate individual person haemophilia ( PWH ) might respond discussion potential change . The primary outcome measure Patient Activation Measure ( PAM ) gauge knowledge , skill confidence essential manage one 's health healthcare . A PAM score predict healthcare outcomes include medication adherence , healthcare utilisation hospital visit . It hypothesize activated patient receptive change treatment regimen , education information health condition . In addition patient activation , study assess range patient report outcomes psychological factor use validated tool . These include patient ' Haemophilia-related quality life ( HAEMO-QoL-A ) , beliefs medicine ( BMQ ) , self-reported adherence ( VERITAS-Pro ) activity level . These tool provide clear patient report outcome haemophilia community , accompany EQ5D data , enable robust health economic evaluation .</detailed_description>
