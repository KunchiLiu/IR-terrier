	<brief_summary>The aim project : ( 1 ) To establish research platform order integrate multiparametric image metabolomics data uterine malignancy . ( 2 ) Identify potential surrogate biomarkers early diagnosis endometrial cancer use multiparametric magnetic resonance image metabolomics approach . ( 3 ) To develop surrogate biomarkers uterine malignancy , detect tumor involvement myometrium , cervix , lymph node . The investigator propose 3-year research project prospectively collect data 150 female patient 20-80 year old , clinically diagnose suspect uterine malignancy . An additional control group comprise 30 patient normal endometrial tissue enrol . Robust magnetic resonance ( MR ) image technique include MR spectroscopy ( MRS ) , diffusion-weighted image chemical exchange saturation transfer ( CEST ) image apply . Biological sample ( tissue , blood , urine ) analyze detailed metabolomics approach ( high-resolution MRS ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MRI Metabolomics Biomarkers Uterine Malignancy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In 1st year part project , investigator aim identify difference normal endometrium cancer tissue . Standard conventional MR study plus MRS , diffusion-weighted imaging CEST sequence carry 30 eligible surgical candidate pretreatment clinical assessment.Metabolites cancer tissue collect operation analyze use high resolution MRS , compare control group . The primary endpoint part identify different image metabolomic profile normal cancer subject . In 2nd year , investigator continue accumulate case number , order evaluate diagnostic accuracy advance MR image metabolomics biomarker , prediction T stag myometrial involvement . By end 3rd year , investigator collect 150 patient , approximately 20 case cervical invasion 20 case nodal metastasis , order answer approach predict cervical stromal involvement , nodal distant metastasis . The clinical importance project answer relevant question , i.e. , prediction tumor involvement myometrium , cervix , lymph node . This important understanding background mechanism change identify MR 18-F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) /PET , order develop novel image biomarkers therapeutic target . Both molecular imaging metabolomics complimentary share similarity : ( 1 ) Comprehensive data represent information living system whole ( 2 ) information rich data reflect complexity biological system ( 3 ) ease longitudinal observation . Metabolomics data provide detail biochemistry whilst image data provide spatial localization detail . A combination image metabolomics approach would ideal tool develop biomarkers uterine malignancy . By completion project , investigator expect important metabolic biomarkers establish , potentially serve functional tool guide therapy patient uterine malignancy .</detailed_description>
