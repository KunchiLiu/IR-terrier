	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate whether novel anti-cancer drug OXY111A safe tolerate patient primary secondary hepato-pancreato-biliary gastrointestinal neoplasia measure explore maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) . At level MTD , additional patient include aim assess efficacy profile neoplasia entity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects OXY111A Primary Secondary Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary Neoplasm</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The IMP OXY111A counteract hypoxia-induced tumor aggressiveness show decreased tumor burden increase survival five different animal solid tumor model apply monotherapy increase beneficial effect follow standard chemotherapy . The unique ability IMP counteract hypoxic tumor behaviour along non-toxic side effect test animal healthy volunteer outmost interest explore patient solid tumor . The study seek primarily determine safety tolerability OXY111A patient primary secondary hepato-pancreato-biliary gastrointestinal neoplasia measure explore MTD conservative 3+3 dose escalation schedule . The window DLT assessment first dose study drug first dose standard care chemotherapy 10 day follow completion last dose study drug ( whichever short duration ) . Additionally , assess efficacy OXY111A decrease tumor volume , metabolic activity , well circulatory tumor angiogenic marker .</detailed_description>
