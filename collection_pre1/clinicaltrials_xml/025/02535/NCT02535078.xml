	<brief_summary>This study Phase Ib/II , multi-center , open-label study IMCgp100 single agent combination durvalumab ( MEDI4736 ) and/or tremelimumab metastatic cutaneous melanoma . The purpose study characterize safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) , pharmacodynamics , anti-tumor activity IMCgp100 combination durvalumab ( MEDI4736 , program death-ligand 1 [ PD-L1 ] inhibitor ) , tremelimumab ( CLTA-4 inhibitor ) , combination durvalumab tremelimumab compare single-agent IMCgp100 alone . The study enroll patient metastatic melanoma refractory treatment anti-PD-1 inhibitor well patient naive therapy metastatic setting . Recent biologic evidence indicate optimal response program cell death-1 ( PD-1 ) direct therapy require presence CD8+ T cell tumor microenvironment thus therapy IMCgp100 recruit effector cell tumor may overcome pre-existing resistance checkpoint blockade . This emerge biology checkpoint inhibitor resistance suggest combination IMCgp100 checkpoint inhibition may enhance activity patient pre-existing resistance .</brief_summary>
