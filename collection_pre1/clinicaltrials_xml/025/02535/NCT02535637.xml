	<detailed_description>The objective study determine offspring overweight/obese non-diabetic mother breastfeed great total fat trunk fat mass accumulate fat mass great rate ~ 1 month 6 month life compare breastfed infant normal weight mother . Specific Aim 1 : Understand maternal obesity breast-feeding impact body composition offspring . Based upon investigator preliminary data counter accept dogma hypothesis six month age total fat mass , particularly trunk elevate 6 month age infant whose mother either overweight obese vs. infant normal weight mother . Specific Aim 2 : Identify adipocytokines breast milk . The postulate breast milk overweight obese mother great level insulin , glucose , Ghrelin , IGF-1 , IL-6 , TNFα , high-sensitivity C-reactive protein , low Leptin level breast milk normal weight mother correlate offspring fat mass .</detailed_description>
