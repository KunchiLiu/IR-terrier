	<brief_summary>Background : Systemic lupus erythematosus ( lupus ) autoimmune disease often involve many system organ body . Symptoms include fever , joint pain , rash . Serious lupus also damage organ like kidney , lung , brain . Drugs use lupus serious side effect . Also , drug help people . Researchers want find new , effective safe treatment . Objective : To evaluate safety tolerability drug tofacitinib ( study drug ) people lupus . Eligibility : People age 18 old mild moderate lupus currently recently certain lupus treatment . Design : Participants screen another protocol . Participants 7 five-hour visit 3 month . They fill multiple questionnaire . They test , include : - Physical exam - Blood urine test - ECG/EKG : Soft electrode stick skin monitor heart . - Optional SphygmoCor : Cuffs attach arm thigh measure blood pressure flow speed . - Optional Endopat : A thimble-shaped cup place finger measure blood flow . A cuff put arm measure blood pressure flow . - Optional CAVI : ECG electrode place wrist , microphone place chest , blood pressure cuff place arm leg measure blood pressure velocity . Participants receive either study drug placebo . They take twice day mouth 56 day . Participants contact phone 4 time .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ( SLE ) autoimmune disease variegate clinical presentation result involvement multiple biologic pathway . The pathways lead loss tolerance SLE include : multiple autoreactive cell type ( B , T , dendritic , Th17 regulatory T cell ) abnormal cytokine milieu , genetic factor , environmental hormonal influence , influence cell differentiation pattern reset tolerance checkpoint . In addition , recent study indicate putative role neutrophil lupus pathogenesis associate end-organ damage . Currently available therapeutic frequently inadequate treat disease flare simultaneously expose patient potentially serious toxicity . Further , premature cardiovascular disease explain Framingham risk equation become one important cause morbidity mortality patient population . To date , treatment use lupus appear significantly decrease cardiovascular risk . Identifying drug immunomodulatory effect also vasculoprotective unmet need disease . Tofacitinib orally administer Janus kinase ( JAK ) inhibitor recently approve Food Drug Administration treatment moderate severe rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) . The JAKs family intracellular enzyme ( JAK1 , 2 3 TYK2 ) mediate signal via broad range cytokine receptor . Targeting JAKs attractive therapeutic possibility SLE many reason . Many inflammatory cytokine implicate pathogenesis SLE signal via JAK-STAT pathway . JAK inhibitor find efficacy various murine model lupus . Mice treat JAK2 inhibitor exhibit reduced serum level IL-6 , IL-17 along reduced number long-lived autoantibody produce plasma cell spleen bone marrow . Furthermore , find administration tofacitinib reduce serum level ANA , IL-6 , IFN-gamma ; ameliorate glomerulonephritis ( unpublished data ) . This study therefore represent innovative investigative measure safety efficacy JAK inhibition SLE predict genetic predisposition . We also investigate effect tofacitinib vascular function SLE subject identify biomarkers may useful endpoint future study . PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : To determine safety tolerability tofacitinib patient SLE mild moderate disease activity . STUDY DESIGN : This Phase Ib , randomize , double blind , placebo control clinical trial orally administer tofacitinib , 5 mg twice daily , treatment SLE subject mild moderate disease activity stratify presence absence STAT4 risk allele .</detailed_description>

Has mild moderate disease activity define SLEDAI 2K equal 2 less equal 14 screen visit . If glucocorticoid , dose must less equal 20 mg daily stable 4 week prior screen visit . If hydroxychloroquine antimalarial chloroquine quinacrine , dose must stable 12 week prior screen visit . The maximum allow dose hydroxychloroquine 400 mg/day 6.5 mg/kg/day 400 mg/day . The maximum allow dose chloroquine phosphate 250 mg daily quinacrine to100 mg daily . Males females potential reproduction must agree practice effective birth control measure . Females adequate contraception childbearing potential documented clinician , unless patient spouse previously undergone sterilization procedure . Adequate consider intrauterine device ( IUD ) alone hormone implant , hormone patch , injectables , oral contraceptive plus barrier method ( male condom , female condom diaphragm ) , abstinence vasectomized partner If patient ACE inhibitor ARB medication , dose medication must stable 4 week prior study entry . Patients may lipid lower medication initiate least 6 month prior screen visit . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Pregnant lactate woman . Women childbearing potential require negative pregnancy test screening . Current prior treatment rituximab , belimumab biologic agent 6 month prior screen . Current treatment immunosuppressive drug ( methotrexate , azathioprine , mycophenolate mofetil , cyclosporine , tacrolimus ) . Glucocorticoids allow per inclusion criterion . At investigator discretion , glucocorticoid may taper study . Patients previously methotrexate , mycophenolate mofetil , cyclosporine tacrolimus stop least 8 week time screen . Treatment cyclophosphamide , pulse methylprednisolone IVIG within 6 month prior screen . Increase glucocorticoid dose within 4 week screen . A history drug alcohol abuse within 6 month prior screen . History chronic liver disease elevate LFTs : ALT AST great equal 2x upper limit normal screen serum unconjugated bilirubin &gt; 2mg/dL screen Dialysis serum creatinine &gt; 1.5mg/dL . Protein creatinine ratio 1 mg/mg 24 hour urine protein 1000 mg . Active urinary sediment ( WBC , RBC mix cellular cast 1+ /hpf ) .

Active infection require use oral intravenous antibiotic resolve least 2 week prior administration first dose study medication . Active chronic infection include limited HIV , Hepatitis B , Hepatitis C , BK viremia screen visit . History cancer , exclude skin cancer ( squamous cell basal cell treat ) . Known active tuberculosis untreated latent tuberculosis . History opportunistic infection . Subjects active renal central nervous system disease BILAG A organ system .

Current treatment potent inhibitor Cytochrome P450 3A4 ( CYP3A4 ) ( e.g. , ketoconazole ) receive one concomitant medication result moderate inhibition CYP3A4 potent inhibition CYP2C19 ( e.g. , fluconazole ) would increase serum availability tofacitinib . Past treatment mention agent allow week prior administration first dose study medication . Significant impairment major organ function ( lung , heart , liver , kidney ) condition , opinion Investigator , would jeopardize subject safety follow exposure study drug .</criteria>
