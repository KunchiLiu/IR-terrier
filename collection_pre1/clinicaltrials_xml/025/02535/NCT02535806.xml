	<brief_title>Four Drug Reinduction With Bortezomib Relapsed Refractory ALL LL Children Young Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1.0 GOALS AND OBJECTIVES ( SCIENTIFIC AIMS ) 1.1 Primary Aims 1.1.1 To evaluate feasibility toxicity use bortezomib combination ALL R3 re-induction regimen pediatric patient relapse refractory ALL LL . 1.1.2 To determine rate complete response negative minimal residual disease status follow bortezomib combine R3 reinduction . 2.0 BACKGROUND Despite progress make treatment ALL child , relapse disease remain significant treatment problem . By , number patient relapse ALL would 4th common childhood malignancy overall survival patient poor . Using conventional treatment , second remission rate bone marrow relapse ALL 81-93 % long-term event free survival ( EFS ) 27-50 % . Initial standard therapy child follow relapse include four drug reinduction strategy , typically use prednisone , vincristine , PEG-asparaginase , doxorubicin . For child first marrow relapse ALL le 36 month diagnosis , four drug reinduction strategy result CR rate 68 % . However , 75 % patient CR2 minimal residual disease ( MRD ) positive ( &gt; 0.01 % ) end reinduction . The presence MRD relapse ALL strongly associate bad long term outcome . For child ALL relapse follow second ( CR2 ) remission , outcomes dismal 5 year disease free survival 15 % . In 2010 , result publish ALL R3 trial Children 's Cancer Leukemia Group United Kingdom Ireland . This trial randomize child first relapse ALL receive four drug reinduction use either mitoxantrone idarubicin anthracycline . The study close early due statistically significant improvement survival child randomize mitoxantrone . Children receive mitoxantrone 3 year disease free survival 64.6 % compare 35.9 % idarubicin group . Toxicities study excessive , child randomize receive mitoxantrone significantly less toxicity idarubicin group . Based result trial , Children 's Oncology Group ( COG ) begin use reinduction regimen backbone new clinical trial child relapse ALL . Despite improvement outcome child relapse ALL treat mitoxantrone R3 study , still need continued effort improve outcome patient ALL LL experience relapse . This particularly true high risk group early bone marrow relapse ( &lt; 36 month diagnosis ) , second great relapse relapse LL long term survival remain less 50 % Bortezomib proteasome inhibitor demonstrate activity number cancer type include acute leukemia . Bortezomib act inhibit ubiquitin-proteasome pathway result blockade NF-κB activation stabilization multiple proapoptotic protein include p53 , p21 , p27 , Bax . Collectively , effect induce apoptosis enhance cytotoxic effect chemotherapy . In Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program ( PPTP ) , bortezomib show activity number ALL cell line . As single agent , bortezomib effective inhibit NF-κB clinical response 9 heavily pretreated child ALL . Proteasome inhibition able induce apoptosis , may best utilized combination conventional chemotherapy drug help overcome resistance . Preclinical evaluation bortezomib number drug commonly use pediatric ALL therapy demonstrate synergy dexamethasone additive effect give along vincristine , asparaginase , doxorubicin . In phase 1 study child relapse ALL bortezomib combine four drug reinduction use dexamethasone , vincristine , doxorubicin , PEG-asparaginase intrathecal therapy , bortezomib dose 1.3 mg/m2 give day 1 , 4 , 8 11 well tolerate . The phase 2 study regimen able produce complete response complete response without platelet recovery 73 % patient . These result encourage heavily pretreated patient treat 2 3 previous regimen . Due 3 death infectious toxicity , study amend require infectious prophylaxis vancomycin , levofloxacin , voriconazole . No death see child follow change . Other toxicity see study include grade 3 peripheral neuropathy 2 patient . This phase II study design investigate combination bortezomib mitoxantrone reinduction regimen use ALL R3 trial . The study enroll patient high risk ALL relapse include early bone marrow relapse second great relapse kind . Patients relapse LL also eligible . Bone marrow evaluation perform blood count recover assess rate CR ( &lt; 5 % bone marrow blast ) MRD status child follow regimen . Further treatment without HSCT discretion primary physician . 2.1 Bortezomib Injection 2.1.1 Scientific Background Bortezomib Injection small-molecule proteasome inhibitor develop Millennium Pharmaceuticals , Inc. , ( Millennium ) novel agent treat human malignancy . Bortezomib currently approve United States Food Drug Administration ( US FDA ) treatment patient multiple myeloma ( MM ) . It also indicate treatment patient mantle cell lymphoma ( MCL ) receive least 1 prior therapy . In European Union ( EU ) , bortezomib combination melphalan prednisone indicate treatment patient previously untreated MM eligible high-dose chemotherapy bone marrow transplant . Bortezomib indicate monotherapy treatment progressive MM patient receive least 1 prior therapy already undergone unsuitable bone marrow transplantation . By inhibit single molecular target , proteasome , bortezomib affect multiple signal pathway . The antineoplastic effect bortezomib likely involve several distinct mechanism , include inhibition cell growth survival pathway , induction apoptosis , inhibition expression gene control cellular adhesion , migration , angiogenesis . Thus , mechanism bortezomib elicits antitumor activity may vary among tumor type , extent affect pathway critical inhibition tumor growth could also differ . Bortezomib novel pattern cytotoxicity National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) vitro vivo assay . ( 19 ) In addition , bortezomib cytotoxic activity variety xenograft tumor model , single agent combination chemotherapy radiation . Notably , bortezomib induces apoptosis cell express bcl-2 , genetic trait confers unregulated growth resistance conventional chemotherapeutics . The mechanisms action lead apoptosis clearly define include initiation unfolded protein response direct/indirect effect various molecular target include cell cycle control proteins p27 p21 , cyclins , signal transduction molecule , transcription factor c-jun HIF1- , tumor suppressor protein p53 , angiogenesis factor , many others . Bortezomib think efficacious multiple myeloma via inhibition nuclear factor B ( NF-B ) activation , attenuation interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) -mediated cell growth , direct apoptotic effect , possibly anti-angiogenic effect .</detailed_description>
