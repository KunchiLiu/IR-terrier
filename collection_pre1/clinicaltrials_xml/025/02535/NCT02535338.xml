	<brief_title>Erlotinib Hydrochloride Hsp90 Inhibitor AT13387 Treating Patients With Recurrent Metastatic EGFR-Mutant Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety tolerability erlotinib hydrochloride ( erlotinib ) Hsp90 inhibitor AT13387 ( onalespib ) patient EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . ( PHASE I ) II . To preliminarily assess efficacy combination erlotinib onalespib recommend phase II dose ( RP2D ) determine phase I portion study EGFR-mutant NSCLC patient complete partial response Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 frontline erlotinib within 6 month . ( PHASE II , COHORT A ) III . To preliminarily assess efficacy combination erlotinib onalespib RP2D NSCLC patient whose tumor harbor EGFR Exon 20 Insertion ( EGFR mutation typically responsive single agent erlotinib ) . ( PHASE II , COHORT B ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To observe record anti-tumor activity ( primary aim phase II , secondary aim phase I ) . II . To evaluate preliminary manner progression-free survival ( PFS ) disease control rate ( DCR ) patient treat erlotinib/onalespib . III . To characterize pharmacokinetics drug combination recommend phase II dose ( RP2D ) . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To explore plasma EGFR-mutant deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) biomarker detect change plasma EGFR-mutant DNA level ( include plasma EGFR-T790M ) new mutation may represent resistance treatment . II . To demonstrate knockdown Hsp90 client oncoproteins via treatment erlotinib onalespib multiplexed immunofluorescence serial tumor biopsy . III . To establish patient derive xenotransplant model EGFR-mutated NSCLC focus tumor lack response single agent erlotinib patient tumor harbor EGFR exon 20 insertion . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study Hsp90 inhibitor AT13387 follow phase II study . Patients receive erlotinib hydrochloride orally ( PO ) daily Hsp90 inhibitor AT13387 intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day least 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 12 week 1 year annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
