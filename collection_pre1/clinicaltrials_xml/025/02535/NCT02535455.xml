	<brief_summary>Innovative approach need optimize benefit treatment prevention ( TasP ) among HIV+ substance user , experience profound health disparity amplify onward transmission risk . This project systematically develop , refine conduct open pilot ass feasibility acceptability two-phase emotion regulation intervention target emotional barrier HIV-related self-care among individual endorse active substance use . Emotional barrier shame internalized stigma identify barrier optimal HIV care among individual struggle HIV substance use . To effectively implement TasP , strategies address barrier need . Utilizing transdiagnostic approach ( e.g. , positive affect-focused emotional regulation , mindfulness self-compassion ) investigator develop , refine pilot two-phase emotional regulation intervention require 5 face-to-face hour ultimately implement case-management-level staff person train peer educator . The first phase intervention multicomponent in-person intervention target emotional , cognitive behavioral barrier HIV self-care behavior among HIV+ substance user . The second phase intervention extend intervention benefit send personalized positive self-reappraisal text message response text message query participant ' mood . This phase use innovative personalize bi-directional platform , leverage exist text message delivery system . This project instrumental develop relatively low-resource intervention strategy address unmet emotional barrier optimal HIV-care among individual actively use substance . This work provide necessary pilot data subsequent grant submission ass preliminary efficacy intervention . The result intervention potential address emotional barrier self-care along HIV care cascade : include retention care , antiretroviral treatment adherence persistence , ultimately viral suppression .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Investigators develop refine two-phase emotion regulation intervention . This process involve 5 step : 1 ) conduct 5-8 key informant interview , include obtain feedback draft manual material provider case manager , 2 ) integrate qualitative data , 3 ) run 2 participant condensed version intervention obtain feedback content , language , text message interface , 4 ) integrate additional feedback , 5 ) conduct open pilot 20 participant assess feasibility acceptability revise intervention . The pilot include 4 research assessment visit involve completion self-report questionnaire use Qualtrics baseline , within one week completion phase 1 , within one week complete phase 2 , 4-months follow completion phase 1 . Viral load ( VL ) CD4 test assess baseline VL assess 4-month follow . Qualitative interview . The investigator conduct 5-8 semi-structured qualitative interview provider case manager . Interviews inquire unmet psychological barrier HIV-care , perception propose domain text message question response option . All interview record , transcribed analyzed use thematic analysis . Prominent theme suggestion bring interview integrate intervention material implementation . Trial run pilot . After integrate feedback key informant interview , investigator recruit two participant complete condense version intervention . After 5 session , participant ask complete perceive usefulness survey . Both participant interview obtain feedback intervention . These interview record , transcribe analyze use thematic analysis . Prominent theme suggestion bring interview well logistic challenge integrate intervention material implementation procedure . Text message . Investigators use question adapt previously publish personalize bi-directional text message intervention involve HIV+ substance user ( TxText ) ass mood , adherence substance use . Each participant receive 3 texts/week inquire current mood course intervention . Additionally , phase 2 participant receive weekly text ask medication adherence . Given stigmatized nature substance use , investigator use coded query , adapt TxText , ass substance use form weather question . This coded query strategy demonstrate feasibility acceptability among similar population HIV+ active substance user . All participant remind mean question phase 1 . During last in-person intervention visit , participant identify 5 positive self-reappraisal statement link response option mood query base feel would helpful regulate emotion . Throughout phase 2 , participant receive link positive-self reappraisal statement response mood query . Participants ask respond 6-point scale indicate helpful positive self-reappraisal ( 0=extremely unhelpful 5= extremely helpful ) , use assess engagement phase 2 intervention . HIV disease marker . Blood sample 35mL peripheral venous blood sample obtain baseline final follow-up visit assess viral load . CD4 count assess baseline provide personalized feedback HIV-related self-care . A total 44 blood sample obtain , 2 participant pilot .</detailed_description>
