	<brief_summary>This open label investigation evaluate safety , efficacy potential mechanism action new form electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) . The investigator recently complete preliminary open-label study FEAST , first Columbia University , Medical University South Carolina Charleston ( Nahas et al. , 2013b ) . The investigator publish outcome first 17 patient study . One patient withdrew study single titration session . After course FEAST ( median 10 session ) , 46.1 + 35.5 % improvement Hamilton Rating Scale Depression ( HRSD24 ) score compare baseline ( 33.1 + 6.8 , 16.8 + 10.9 ; P &lt; 0.0001 ) . Eight 16 patient meet response criterion ( ≥50 % decrease HRSD24 ) 5/16 meet remission criterion ( HRSD24≤10 ) . Patients achieve full re-orientation ( 4 5 item correct ) 5.5 + 6.4 min ( median time = 3.6 min ) , time eye first open treatment . The investigator study 18 patient ( see result ) , complete study original IDE another two patient still enroll . This work allow u refine treatment . For example , investigator selectively modify electrode geometry decrease interelectrode resistance . Additionally investigator modify titration schedule , administer standard 800 ultrabrief pulse , thus longer titrate current domain . In next propose trial continue gather efficacy safety data , compare parallel non-randomized group receive ECT standard care . ECT typically deliver dynamically adaptive manner , person different number treatment , average 8-12 treatment 4-5 week . We thus use imprecise time point 'at end acute treatment course ' rather specify date visit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Focal Electrically-Administered Seizure Therapy ( FEAST ) Studies Two Enrolling Sites Further Test Refine Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study provide preliminary evaluation follow : 1 . Further characterization efficacy FEAST safety treatment . 1 . The primary efficacy measure 24-item Hamilton Rating Scale Depression . The change score immediately follow treatment course ( typically 4 week ) compare patient treat FEAST methodology match nonrandomized patient facility treat conventional ECT method ( ultrabrief right unilateral [ RUL ] ECT ) . 2 . Acute subacute cognitive side effect follow FEAST assessed brief neuropsychological battery . The primary acute measure time return orientation follow seizure induction . The primary subacute measure assessment retrograde amnesia autobiographical information . The neuropsychological measure compare patient treat FEAST methodology ( IDE ) match ( nonrandomized ) patient treat conventional ECT method ( also cover IDE ) . 3 . Safety also determine examine number frequency serious adverse advent adverse event . 2 . Characterization focal nature seizure onset FEAST RUL ECT . We use two main method address issue focality . 1 . Resting state fMRI course FEAST ( conventional RUL ECT ) . We address whether FEAST cause change hyper connect prefrontal cortical subcortical network , whether effect restrict prefrontal cortex FEAST relative conventional RUL ECT . 2 . Peri-ictal EEG acquire immediately , immediately FEAST seizure . We acquire patient treatment session . Again , comparison , use identical EEG acquisition method patient treat conventional RUL ECT .</detailed_description>
