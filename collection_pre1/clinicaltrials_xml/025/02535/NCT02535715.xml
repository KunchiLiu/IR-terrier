	<brief_title>A Euglycemic Insulin Clamp Study Type 1 Diabetic Patients With Oral Insulin ( ORAMED )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Insulin therapy absolute requirement type 1 diabetic patient . Multiple injection present barrier achieve normal/near-normal glucose control diabetic patient ( 1 ) . Therefore , considerable interest develop alternative route insulin administration . ORAMED develop oral insulin , preliminary study , show promise . In present study investigator perform pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic study evaluate novel insulin preparation potential therapeutic option type 1 diabetic patient . 10 type 1 diabetic subject study . Each subject study three occasion interval 3 day 4 week study . During study subject receive : ( ) two 8 mg ORAMED capsule contain insulin ; ( ii ) three 8 mg ORAMED capsule contain insulin ; ( iii ) one 16 mg ORAMED capsule contain insulin . If fasting plasma glucose &gt; 200mg/dl procedure day , procedure reschedule . Prior study subject refrain eat ( except water ) 10 night report Clinical Research Center approximately 7 morning . A catheter place antecubital vein prime ( 40 microCuries x fast plasma glucose/100 ) - continuous ( 0.4 microCuries/min ) infusion tritiated glucose start continued end study . Plasma glucose monitor necessary 1st hour tracer equilibration , small amount IV regular insulin administer obtain fasting plasma glucose 100-130mg/dl . After 3-hour tracer equilibration , subject ingest ORAMED capsule contain insulin variable infusion 20 % glucose start maintain plasma glucose concentration 100-120 mg/dl . Plasma sample glucose , insulin , glucagon , free fatty acid ( FFA ) concentration tritiated glucose radioactivity obtain every 5-15 minute 4 hour follow ingestion ORAMED capsule contain insulin . Calculations : Following overnight fast , steady state condition prevail basal rate glucose appearance equal rate glucose disappearance calculate tritiated glucose infusion rate divide tritiated glucose specific activity . Under postabsorptive condition , Basal rate glucose appearance primarily reflect hepatic glucose production ( 2 ) . Following ingestion oral insulin , non-steady state condition prevail Ra Rd calculate use Steele 's equation ( 3 ) . Endogenous ( primarily reflect liver ) glucose production calculate subtract exogenous glucose infusion rate tracer-derived rate glucose appearance . Endogenous rate glucose disappearance reflect glucose uptake tissue body , primarily reflect skeletal muscle ( 4 ) . Sample Size : The present study represent pilot study gain information absorption oral insulin effect hepatic peripheral ( skeletal muscle ) glucose metabolism . This information use determine whether ORAMED oral insulin preparation represent viable option treat diabetic subject , gain information dose response effect ORAMED insulin glucose metabolism , provide quantitative data effect oral insulin hepatic peripheral ( muscle ) glucose metabolism . Therefore , investigator conservatively set sample size 10 .</detailed_description>
