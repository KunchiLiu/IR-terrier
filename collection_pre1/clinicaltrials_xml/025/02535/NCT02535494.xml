	<detailed_description>Study Design A significant cause mortality among opioid user overdose , commonly occur follow voluntary ( opioid detoxification ) involuntary ( incarceration ) opioid abstinence . For purpose current application , opioid overdose define use opioid amount result over-sedation and/or respiratory depression require intervention medical non-medical person . Nearly 85 % overdoses occur presence witness . Common method intervention individual without medical training ineffective technique shake victim inject salt water . Naloxone opioid antagonist long use successfully trained medical personnel emergency resuscitation follow opioid overdose . In effort reduce fatal non-fatal opioid overdose , number state implement program non-medical personnel provide brief instruction recognize sign opioid overdose administer naloxone . However , exist program design collect empirical data safety effectiveness intervention . Reporting naloxone use voluntary without incentive , experience train prescribed naloxone follow . The propose investigation one first large-scale , prospective attempt obtain data effectiveness naloxone distribution among opioid-abusing population high risk unintentional opioid poisoning . Specifically , opioid abuser recruit drug detoxification sit well access service needle exchange program . All participant ( N=700 ) receive standard opioid overdose education naloxone . One third participant randomize receive additional in-depth psychosocial education focus recognition prevention opioid overdose , appropriate use naloxone . Another third participant receive extensive training require engage spouse , partner , relative , friend supplementary intervention . We plan randomize individual group [ Treatment Usual ( TAU ) vs. Extensively Trained ( ET ) vs. Extensively Trained Significant Other ( ETwSO ) ] , continue follow one year , compare self-reported overdose reversal attempt ( without naloxone use ) , naloxone-related adverse event , change pattern heroin drug use . In addition compare outcome variable TAU , ET ETwSO group prospectively , analyze data collect study initiation compare fatal non-fatal opioid overdose rate neighborhood facility offer overdose prevention train naloxone , use data provide collaborator New York City ( NYC ) Department Health Mental Hygiene ( DOHMH ) . Specific Aims Hypotheses - Primary Aim ( Prospective Study ) : Determine extent additional psychosocial intervention improve effectiveness current overdose prevention training measure : - increase frequency naloxone use ( ETwSO &gt; ET &gt; TAU ) - decrease number opioid overdoses ( ETwSO &lt; ET &lt; TAU ) - improve recognition opioid overdose naloxone indication knowledge ( increased BORRA score ; ETwSO &gt; ET &gt; TAU ) - Secondary Aim ( Prospective Study ) : Determine potential harm novel naloxone-prescribing practice measure : - proportion participant call 911 response overdose , compare participant ' recent history call 911 response overdose - risky drug use behavior ( e.g . increase heroin/prescription opioid use , increase use illicit drug combination ) follow training , compare pre-training Outcome Measures Primary Outcome Measures ( Prospective Study ) : Determine extent additional psychosocial intervention improve upon effectiveness current overdose prevention training : 1 ) increase frequency naloxone use among ET participant ( continuous variable ) ; 2 ) decrease number lethal opioid overdoses witness experienced ET group ( continuous variable ) ; 3 ) improve accurate recognition opioid overdose naloxone indication knowledge ( increased Brief Overdose Recognition Response Assessment ( BORRA ) score among ET participant ( continuous variable ) . These variable assess repeatedly course 1 year : baseline ( BL ) , immediately post-training ( T0 ) , 1- , 3- , 6- 12-months ( T1 , T3 , T6 , T12 ) . The frequency naloxone use outcome overdose reversal attempt measure T1 , T3 , T6 , T12 . Secondary Outcome Measures ( Prospective Study ) : Evaluate potential harm novel naloxone-prescribing practice assess : 1 ) decrease proportion 911 call response overdose , compare participant ' previous history call 911 witness overdose ( continuous variable ) ; 2 ) change use illicit opioids , illegal drug , drug combination follow training ( longitudinal continuous variable ) ; 3 ) prevalence adverse event relate naloxone administration non-medical personnel ( continuous variable ) . Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria All participant must meet follow inclusion criterion enrol study : - Male female age 21 65 year - Has meet Diagnostic Statistical Manual ( DSM ) -V criterion moderate-severe opioid use disorder within past 6-months , actively use heroin , prescription opioids , detoxify within last 3 month . - In otherwise good health base medical history laboratory test - Able provide inform consent comply study procedures - Able fluently speak read English - Able identify spouse , friend relative willing serve `` significant '' Participants enrol study he/she meet follow exclusion criterion : - Active psychiatric disorder might interfere participation make participation hazardous , include DSM-V organic mental disorder , psychotic disorder , bipolar disorder mania - Naloxone training opioid overdose prevention previous 2 year ( Clinical Interview ) - Previous Basic Cardiac Life Support First-Aid train previous 2 year - Active treatment extended-release naltrexone ( Vivitrol ) alcohol opioid dependence</detailed_description>
