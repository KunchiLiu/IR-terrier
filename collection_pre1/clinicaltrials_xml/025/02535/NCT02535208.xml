	<brief_summary>The primary aim study determine mean number red blood cell ( RBC ) transfusion receive preterm infant care use restrictive Hgb guideline combination splanchnic cerebral oxygenation ratio ( SCOR ) assessment compare mean number transfusion receive preterm infant care use liberal guideline alone . This study design prospective randomize controlled trial . Preterm infants less 30 week gestational age 500-1250 gram weight recruit enrolled study day life 0 3 . Study participant randomly assign two group : restrictive transfusion group liberal transfusion group . In liberal group , RBC transfusion give subject Hgb level fall define value base respiratory support status . In restrictive group , RBC transfusion give subject either Hgb level fall define value base respiratory status , despite reach Hgb trigger threshold , manifest symptom judge clinical care team consistent anemia ( i.e . apnea , bradycardia , desaturation episode ) subsequently near-infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) evaluation demonstrate SCOR &lt; 0.73 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Previous study demonstrate premature infant transfuse use restrictive guideline , red blood cell ( RBC ) transfusion trigger relatively low Hgb threshold , receive significantly few transfusion similar clinical outcome premature infant transfuse use liberal transfusion guideline use high Hgb threshold . However , remain apprehensive restrictive transfusion approach , primarily research remain somewhat limited . In addition , concern also exist previous researcher find although difference mortality base whether restrictive liberal transfusion guideline use , find liberal transfusion policy may provide neuro-protective benefit . This implies may circumstance neonate transfuse restrictive strategy could benefit increased Hgb level , receive transfusion Hgb drop predefined transfusion trigger level . The investigator previously demonstrate observational study measure tissue oxygen saturation ( rSO2 ) level use near-infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) specific determine RBC transfusion need preterm population rely Hgb value derive blood sample . Using model calculate splanchnic cerebral oxygenation ratio ( SCOR ) [ splanchnic rSO2 / cerebral rSO2 ] could predict high probability preterm infant would improve clinically RBC transfusion . Infants low SCOR , physiologic state blood oxygen divert away gastrointestinal tract , usually benefit transfusion . Neonates high SCOR , oxygen saturation gut tissue relatively constant brain tissue , unlikely improve transfusion . The intent study determine whether SCOR assessment ( perform addition traditional measurement Hbg ) good predict premature infant benefit RBC transfusion subset infant demonstrate sign anemia reach transfusion threshold restrictive transfusion protocol . The goal ass whether additional assessment oxygen delivery ( SCOR ) safely reduce rate transfusion group subject treat restrictive protocol compare transfuse use liberal transfusion protocol . The hypothesis incorporating measure transfusion need , SCOR , clinical management group preterm infant follow restrictive guideline approach , still reduce average number transfusion infant receive compare similar group preterm infant manage liberal approach , yet difference morbidity , include neurological outcome . This study design prospective randomize controlled trial . Preterm infants less 30 week gestational age 500-1250 gram weight recruit enrolled study day life 0 3 . Study participant randomly assign two group : restrictive transfusion group liberal transfusion group . In liberal group , RBC transfusion give subject Hgb level fall define value base respiratory support status . In restrictive group , RBC transfusion give subject either Hgb level fall define value base respiratory status , despite reach Hgb trigger threshold , manifest symptom judge clinical care team consistent anemia ( i.e . apnea , bradycardia , desaturation episode ) subsequently near-infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) evaluation demonstrate SCOR &lt; 0.73 .</detailed_description>
