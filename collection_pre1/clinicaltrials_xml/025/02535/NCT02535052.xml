	<brief_summary>This study investigate function immune system people chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) compare people normal kidney . The investigator use standard vaccine - seasonal flu vaccine pneumococcal polysaccharide ( Pneumovax ) vaccine - examine immune system respond challenge . All subject receive recommend vaccine part routine care . Blood urine sample collect tested different time point look immune response develop vaccine difference people CKD without . This help u understand CKD affect function immune system .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Compared general population , people CKD know get infection likely complication . Protective measure vaccination common infection effective patient CKD people healthy kidney . The reason happen clear . It know increase age , body 's immune defence weaken , yet clear different old people CKD compare old people healthy kidney . Understanding CKD affect body 's immune defence new infection vital help prevent severe consequence infection make vaccination effective group people . This project aim look function immune cell CKD patient people normal kidney function , together responses clinically recommended vaccination , include Pneumococcus ( common pneumonia organism ) influenza virus ( flu ) . Study participant invite receive clinically recommend seasonal influenza pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine seasonal influenza vaccination season ( September - December ) , mirror routine care would receive community . Information age , gender pre-existing health problem , together blood urine sample collect CKD patient comparison healthy volunteer follow timepoints : day vaccination , day 7 28 6 month vaccination .</detailed_description>
