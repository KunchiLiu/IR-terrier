	<brief_summary>Muscle strength help determine person 's quality life functional independence . Patients rheumatoid arthritis often suffer muscle weakness pre-diabetic condition call insulin resistance . By study , investigator hope learn patient rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) suffer muscle weakness .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Skeletal Muscle Dysfunction Rheumatoid Arthritis ( RA )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator plan enroll 80 participant RA 30 non-RA control age 35 65 August 2015 December 2018 ( arm-1 ) . The investigator plan perform needle muscle biopsy subset participant agree undergo procedure . From total cohort number enrol participant , 36 participant identify insulin resistance recruit participate pioglitazone study ( arm-2 ) . Those patient elect participate pioglitazone/ placebo study sign separate consent document Visit 1 . Since RA common woman , anticipate 2/3 participant woman . Children , pregnant breast-feeding woman , adult impair consent capacity , vulnerable population enrol . In cross-sectional study , provide informed consent , participant undergo history physical exam rheumatologist verify diagnosis RA healthy volunteer . All inclusion exclusion criterion verify examine physician . During visit , participant complete questionnaire include Brief Pain Inventory ( BPI ) , Health Assessment Questionnaire ( HAQ ) , Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System ( PROMIS ) questionnaire SF-36 . Participants undergo dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) scan assess muscle mass upper leg ( dominant non-dominant side ) , well compute tomography ( CT ) ass body composition . Women child bear age undergo urine pregnancy test . Participants undergo strength test fatigue bout knee extension exercise . Blood drawn glucose , insulin , liver function test ( LFT ) , lipid profile , rheumatoid factor ( RF ) , anti-citrullinated protein antibody ( ACPA ) , insulin like growth factor ( IGF-1 ) , C-Reactive Protein ( CRP ) , insulin like growth factor bind protein-1 ( IGFBP-1 ) insulin like growth factor bind protein-3 ( IGFBP-3 ) . All participant ask wear accelerometer 7 day measure physical activity . The participant schedule return Center Clinical Translational Science ( CCTS ) within 7 day biopsy vastus lateralis muscle . In pioglitazone clinical trial study , 36 participant insulin resistance recruit receive pioglitazone . After participant provide informed consent , woman childbearing potential give urine pregnancy test visit 1 , 3 6 . The investigator review participant eligibility participant randomize receive either pioglitazone 45 mg daily match placebo 15 week . Below dose schedule . Participants start take increase dos three week follow : 1 capsule ( 15mg ) per day 7 day , 1 capsule per day ( 30 mg ) 7 day , 1 capsule ( 45mg ) , tolerate . Participants continue dose ( 45 mg ) throughout 10 week treatment . The placebo non-pioglitazone capsule look identical pioglitazone capsule , contain inert substance , escalate dose schedule . If participant experience difficulty drug , investigator slow pace dose escalation . If take 45 mg/day , may drop study . The placebo capsule look identical pioglitazone capsule , contain inert substance . Drug compound dispensing ( include blind ) handle University Kentucky 's Investigational Drug Service , routinely serve function . All participant pioglitazone study undergo second round assessment . During 15-week drug trial , participant receive monthly phone call monitor adverse effect . Additionally , participant ask fill daily medication diary monitor compliance adverse effect . A skeletal muscle biopsy perform treatment pioglitazone/ placebo , take place within 1-2 week second round assessment follow pioglitazone treatment .</detailed_description>
