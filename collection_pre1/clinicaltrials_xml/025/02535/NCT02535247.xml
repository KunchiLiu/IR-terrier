	<brief_summary>This multicenter , single-arm , open label 2-stage phase 2 study explore monotherapy PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab ( MK-3475 ) give intravenously fix dose 200mg every 3 week 36 cycle patient relapse refractory Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma ( PTCL ) , receive least 1 prior systemic therapy . The primary endpoint study progression-free survival . Secondary outcome overall survival response rate . Patients assessed response PET CT CT every 12 week use revise Cheson criterion . Correlative endpoint exploratory assess PD-1 expression peripheral blood lymphocyte ; peripheral blood T-cell NK-cell functional assay ; PD-1 PD-L1 expression tumor tissue ; tumor infiltrate lymphocyte prognostic predictive biomarkers .</brief_summary>
