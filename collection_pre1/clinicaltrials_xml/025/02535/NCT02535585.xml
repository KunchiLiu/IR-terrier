	<brief_title>Arthroscopic Treatment Anterior Shoulder Dislocation Using Knotted Knotless Anchors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The shoulder joint commonly suffer dislocation , anterior instability frequent form . The overall incidence first-time dislocation require close reduction 23.1 per 100,000 people/year , high incidence male Caucasians . Individuals young age first dislocation show high rate recurrence . Arthroscopic repair gold standard treatment recurrent shoulder dislocation , similar outcome open repair . The technique less aggressive tendon subscapularis need address , lead short hospital stay , less scarring , early return normal activity , great postoperative range motion . In technique , glenoid labrum-ligament complex ( GLLC ) repair use bone anchor metallic , absorbable , flexible . Biomechanical study show three type anchor similar term cyclic load resistance bone fixation . Absorbable anchor frequently use metallic anchor cause postoperative imaging interference MRI study , migrate become loose break , damage articular cartilage . Flexible anchor submit cyclic stress produce cystic cavity bone tissue attachment 21 , probably lead failure glenoid labrum-ligament complex suture . The commonly use technique attachment GLLC knot anchor . Studies show perform arthroscopic knot challenge technically difficult . The knot volume produce friction shoulder movement , lead joint discomfort cartilage damage . The quality soft tissue heal depend knot quality . The dislocation recurrence rate technique range 4 % 19 % . In 2001 , Thal introduce concept tissue fixation use knotless anchor applicability GLLC lesion . Although new technique solve difficulty tie knot , result regard GLLC suture show gap formation complex glenoid bone , delay anchor loosen postoperative arthropathy . The recurrence rate high associate perianchor radiolucency.The recurrence rate technique high 23.8 % . Some researcher publish study use knotless anchor compare technique use knot anchor , demonstrate similar reconstruction labral height functional outcome , recurrence rate still contradictory . To date , prospective randomize control clinical trial compare two technique GLLC repair . Our researcher aim compare clinical outcome image evaluation patient undergoing GLLC repair arthroscopically use absorbable knotless knot anchor .</detailed_description>
