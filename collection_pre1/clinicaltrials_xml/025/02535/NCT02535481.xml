	<brief_summary>Split thickness skin graft normal standard care wound closure . However , invasive procedure associate pain also additional donor site morbidity . Epidermal graft emerge clinical alternative gain clinical practise . Epidermal grafting ( EG ) alternative method autologous skin graft 'harvests ' finer layer skin traditional Split thickness skin grafting ( SSG ) . This potentially result less pain reduced donor site morbidity deliver several cell layer wind may less effective healing wound . It known EG effective alternative SSG . Further mechanism achieve wound healing may different . EG promote wound heal express growth factor accelerate wound heal encourages keratinocyte migration . Whereas SSG transplant several skin layer integrate exist wound bed formal skin cover . The investigator wish compare two clinical practises ; epidermal grafting split thickness skin graft wound heal . Further undertake translational study investigate mechanism technique achieve wound heal .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study evaluate efficacy EG , alternative current wound management therapy , SSG . In pilot study carry centre ( unpublished data ) , investigator note technique offer method autologous skin harvest minimal pain scar free donor site . Moreover , complete wound epithelialisation achieve maintaining patient independence . Therefore , device potential save healthcare resource , eliminate need theatre space hospital bed , result well Patient Reported Outcomes Measures .</detailed_description>
