	<brief_summary>Major depressive disorder place tremendous burden workplace disability year . Its diagnosis base presence characteristic symptom include disturbance mood regulation , maladaptive belief , behaviour . Impairment neurocognitive function ( e.g. , information processing speed , attention , memory , problem solve skill ) absent current diagnostic criterion radar clinical treatment setting , yet increasingly recognize primary cause poor work function outcomes . This disconnect root cause poor vocational outcome target treatment result failure return work follow illness , job underproductivity , work-related stress , contribute indirect cost society year . The investigator seek expand scientific support treat neurocognitive impairment order increase occupational productivity reduce job-related stress associate depression . The investigator develop novel group cognitive remediation ( CR ) treatment , Action-Based Cognitive Remediation ( ABCR ) . It build procedural learn skill explicit work-related role-plays facilitate immediate salient abstraction drill practice remediation technique . The activity develop collaboration community rehabilitation partner study systematic interview job placement specialist supervisors employment site use agency . The props match use work setting include miniature version cash register , file system , conveyer belt , clean closet , garden nursery , secretarial station . The activity capitalize procedural learning skill roleplay prop simulate work environment . ABCR maintain important aspect drill practice , strategic monitoring enhance flexible problem solve approach , bridge . The role-plays follow computerized drill practice exercise therapist facilitate group discussion cognitive skill flexibility thinking drill practice effective directly engage everyday work environment . Thus , bridge use ABCR tangible , procedural , realistic . This approach bridge differentiates treatment standard CR , discussion-based approach limit auditory learning , memory , abstraction deficit observe depression .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants meet PI clinical graduate student discus component cognitive remediation , expectation , client goal . Follow-up meeting occur ensure client satisfaction determine progress goal achievement . Randomization ABCR standard CR do group 8 ensure adequate number participant group . Twenty-four participant randomize group course study . Several aspect treatment match ideal comparison . Both group meet two time per week , two hour per session , 8 week . The computerized drill practice , strategic monitoring , verbal bridging approach use group . The primary difference ratio aspect treatment manner bridge work environment . In standard CR group 60 % session involve computerize drill practice . In ABCR group , 20 % group session devote computer drill , whereas 40 % involve simulate work skill directly link computer task ( see Figure 1 example ) . The remain 40 % group involve didactic component introduces concept session ( e.g. , memory strategy , avoid distractors ) , review homework , group discussion bridge . Strategic monitoring occur aspect treatment , though ABCR link computerized drill work make explicit move back forth computer drill role-play task . Graduate student clinical psychology program train supervised Dr. Bowie conduct treatment group . These student blind study hypothesis , though possible blind group . Video recording session regularly review Dr. Bowie ensure treatment fidelity . In group , participant give opportunity engage supplemental homework exercise outside schedule treatment group . Scientific Brain Training Pro use computer drill session homework , program investigator use previous study . The company provide software research cost , input design output study . Due online availability exercise , participant encourage login program one two time per day 20 minute session . Variability homework completion expect ( therefore consider treatment process variable potential mediator longer-term durability generalization ) , yet compliance sample anticipate engaged standard vocational service program four day per week , give access on-site computer room attend regular appointment . Few previous study examine work stress function supplemental treatment vocational rehabilitation investigator ' knowledge project first measure self-reported psychophysiological indicator stress .</detailed_description>
