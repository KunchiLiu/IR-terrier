	<brief_summary>The purpose study see add probiotic corticosteroid treatment child PFAPA could improve health daily patient reduction febrile period frequency length , along concomitant reduction associate symptom . Current standard care incorporate administration corticosteroid ; however , limit symptom associate PFAPA , corticosteroid use show increase frequency symptom occur . Investigators hypothesize administration probiotic along corticosteroid work decrease frequency febrile episodes occur . Additionally , probiotic may decrease maximal fever experience episode , amount corticosteroid need control symptom , average length episode , number patient ultimately undergo tonsillectomy due unsuccessful treatment medication .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Periodic fever , aphthous stomatitis , pharyngitis , cervical adenitis ( PFAPA ) first describe 1987 study 12 pediatric patient . PFAPA predominately consider pediatric illness onset typically occur age 5 . This syndrome characterized periodic febrile episode ( 39°C - 42°C ) lasting average 4 day recurrence approximately every 21-30 day . Patients classically exhibit least one three major associate symptom ; aphthous stomatitis , pharyngitis , cervical adenitis . Between period fever , patient asymptomatic experience long-term deleterious effect growth development . Currently , etiology syndrome unknown appear heritable target specific population . Due lack applicable diagnostic test , identification PFAPA predominantly dependent patient history physical examination . This methodology rely heavily upon clinical presentation patient 's illness rule cause periodic fever . As result unknown cause PFAPA , several propose treatment approach available . Corticosteroids current standard care ; typically single dose prednisolone ( 1 mg/kg ) , give upon first sign fever subsequent dose febrile period necessary . Several study show administration prednisolone sufficient abort febrile episode . However , treatment method typically result decrease healthy interval fever reoccurrence . The reduction fever allow child attend school participate activates , increased frequency provide additional complication child parent . Oral cimetidine , histamine H-2 receptor agonist result reduce production stomach acid , also use possible treatment . This treatment show inhibit febrile episode , effective &lt; 30 % patient . If medication therapy fail resolve recurrent febrile episode , option tonsillectomy present possible alternative . PFAPA syndrome show resolve majority patient , however prefer first line treatment due risk associate surgery general anesthesia . Recently publish literature suggest potential new treatment PFAPA target chemokines proinflammatory cytokine . A possible method inhibition cyclic inflammatory response PFAPA would exposure patient safe level continuous low-grade inflammation , result immune response . In previous study investigate allergy eczema relief pediatric population , show administration probiotic induce elevated level inflammatory marker . These low level inflammatory response result adverse effect provide immunologic activation benefit . Use probiotic provide previously unstudied approach treatment PFAPA . Dr. Nicholas Bennett also observe anecdotal evidence patient self-administered probiotic experienced relief PFAPA symptom . This randomize , prospective , double-blind , placebo-controlled study randomization do research pharmacist use equal randomization process , stratification patient . Dr. Bennett patient recruiter remain blinded participant group assignment . The standard care consist corticosteroid dose 1 mg/kg body weight give onset febrile period , repeat within 24 hour necessary , two dos per cycle . The second dose corticosteroid give within one day follow initial dosage fever persist . The investigational product administer daily duration study . For investigational product patient instructed take daily one sachet study product mixed 60 ml water hot . On day 90±7 , 180±7 270±7 patient come study site re-supply probiotic evaluation compliance . Throughout 1-year followup period , parent ask keep journal track corticosteroid usage , probiotic usage , additional medication usage , fever intensity , associate symptom . Standardized thermometer provide ensure consistency . These journal collect patient progress monitor standard care visit every three month . In addition , follow-up phone call make monthly ass progress address concern .</detailed_description>
