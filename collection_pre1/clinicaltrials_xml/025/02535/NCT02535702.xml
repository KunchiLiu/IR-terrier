	<brief_summary>Background : Abusing alcohol , drug , substance cause serious health problem . These substance also affect brain function . Researchers want learn brain function use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . This use magnetic field radio wave take picture brain . Objective : To develop new way use MRI study brain . Eligibility : Healthy people 18 year age old . Design : Participants screen medical history , physical exam , blood urine test . They answer question drug use psychiatric history . They ask family history alcoholism drug abuse . Participants answer question see participate MRI . Participants MRI scan . The scanner metal cylinder strong magnetic field . Participants lie table slide cylinder . A device call coil may place head . Each sub-study include 3 different MRI visit . Participants multiple sub-studies . But 1 MRI per week 20 per year . During MRI visit , participant may urine collect . They may get another MRI questionnaire . Participants may clinical MRI brain scan . This may show physical problem brain . During scan , participant may perform simple movement , memory , think task . Participants may connect machine monitor brain activity scan . Small metal electrode place scalp . A gel place space electrode scalp .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Development Of Neuroimaging Methods To Assess The Neurobiology Of Addiction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Objectives : There two main goal protocol , 1 ) improve sensitivity well spectral spatiotemporal resolution magnetic resonance ( MR ) study assess structural , neurochemical , hemodynamic electrophysiological change occur human brain resting state well occur response novel sensory , motor , cognitive emotional stimulation paradigm ; 2 ) conduct pilot sub-studies , exploratory nature , order gather enough information hypothesis generation . The criterion transition new full protocol sufficient amount information generate power analysis . - Study population : We intend complete study healthy volunteer 120 male 120 female , 18 year old . - Design : We design small project ideas pertinent theme Addiction conduct pilot sub-studies , 16 subject , optimize MR pulse sequence and/or functional MR imaging ( fMRI ) task paradigm . MR pulse sequence and/or fMRI task paradigm validate appropriated gold-standard methods/tasks . These study require order maximize sensitivity new image technique fMRI task use clinical research application take advantage 3T 7T MRI scanner MR center . If exploratory sub-study lead result interest large population necessary reach statistical significance , separate protocol submit priori hypothesis , specific study design power analysis adapt pilot exploratory sub-studies perform present protocol . - Outcome parameter : Although multiple measure collect , primary outcome amplitude reliability regional-specific BOLD fMRI signal . - MRI : analyze measure amplitude reliability test-retest measure fMRI signal ; functional connectivity metric ; tractography seed target region interest ( diffusion tensor imaging , DTI ) ; morphometry brain region ( use automatic segmentation voxel-brain morphometry , VBM ) ; brain metabolite level region interest ( use MR spectroscopy , MRS ) . - EEG ( electroencephalography ) : quantify measure event task-related potential , coherence sensor source locate close brain area interest . - Behavioral measure fMRI task : quantify measure reaction time accuracy ( use MRI compatible response pad ) well eye movement ( use MRI compatible eye tracker ) self-reports study experience ( i.e . degree interest motivation alertness ) . - We may measure autonomic data course fMRI experiment ( blood pressure , skin conductance , respiratory frequency heart rate ) , would correlate outcome measure .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Eighteen year old . 2 . Ability provide write informed consent determine physical examination verbal communication . Capacity consent determine obtain informed consent . 3 . Willingness abstain drug use schedule testing day . EXCLUSION CRITERIA 1 . Positive urine pregnancy test female . 2 . Presence ferromagnetic object body contraindicate MRI head ( include limit pacemaker implant electrical device , brain stimulators , type dental implant , aneurysm clip , metallic prosthesis , permanent eyeliner , implanted delivery pump , shrapnel fragment ) fear enclose space determine selfreport checklist . 3 . Claustrophobia . 4 . Body weight &gt; 550 lb , weight limit MR scanner . 5 . Current past DSMIV DSM5 diagnosis psychiatric disorder ( nicotine/caffeine use disorder ) determine history clinical exam include substance use disorder , alcoholism alcohol dependence . Those binge drink history last 10 year also exclude . Past history mental disorder define DSMIV DSM5 exclude severe enough require hospitalization ( length ) , chronic medication management ( 4 week ) , could impact brain function time study . Binge drinker female consume 4 drink male 5 drink one occasion least month . Subjects receive psychotherapy may include study 6 . Serious neurological disorder MS , Parkinson Disease , ALS , etc 7 . Currently take psychoactive drug Celexa ( TM ) , Prozac ( TM ) , Wellbutrin ( TM ) , Zoloft ( TM ) , and/or stimulant caffeine Adderall ( TM ) , Dexedrine ( TM ) Ritalin ( TM ) . Subjects take PRN medication ( e.g. , sleep medication ) may include study . 8 . Clinically significant laboratory examination result . 9 . Study investigator staff , well superior , subordinate immediate family member ( adult child , spouse , parent , sibling ) . Subjects exclude enrollment onto study urine test positive drug . However , test positive schedule study procedure day involve MRI , procedure postpone reschedule . We allow 3 reschedule study day result positive urine drug screen . If drug test positive third reschedule visit , participant withdrawn study .</criteria>
