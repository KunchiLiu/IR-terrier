	<detailed_description>The dentistry training program report stressful one ; academic pressure high , high level dexterity skill dentistry demand often cite major source stress . There research impact caffeine general energy drink particular academic performance , however , considerably less data impact drink manual dexterity . This study aim test hypothesis relationship consumption energy drink manual dexterity skill final year dental student . Identification baseline caffeine consumption selection sample Baseline caffeine consumption identify distribute caffeine consumption questionnaire final year student Riyadh Colleges Dentistry Pharmacy . Based caffeine consumption score study recruit 60 moderate . To avoid confound effect nicotine consumption , study recruit non-smokers .female candidate take oral contraceptive eliminate due correlation caffeine . Subjects history renal disease prevent participation study Test manual dexterity Acrylic block ( 2cmx2cmx2cm ) prepare use standardized mold . All subject require prepare box 2mmx2mmx2mm use high speed handpiece ( NSK , Japan ) no.330 cut bur . Each participant allow two attempt cut cavity test cavity select assessment . The ability participant reproduce dimension ( 2mmx2mmx2mm ) time take complete task use criterion evaluate dexterity . The participant require perform test 30 minute energy drink exposure . Energy Drink Exposure Subjects test group ( n 30 ) give 330ml energy drink contain caffeine , sugar taurine ( Red Bull , Red Bull GmbH , Austria Vienna ) three hour last meal hand control group ( n30 ) receive placebo drink apple juice . Statistical Analysis Dexterity outcomes compare exposure energy drink use pair test . Outcomes compare different group different time interval use two way , multiple measure ANOVA . All data analyze use SPSS ver.21 data processing software .</detailed_description>
