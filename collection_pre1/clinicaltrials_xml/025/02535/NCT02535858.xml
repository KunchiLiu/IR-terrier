	<brief_summary>Anxiety one major influence relapse substance abuse treatment dropout . Chemically dependent individual need aware emotional state situation jeopardise treatment . The current therapeutic resource still subjective limited treatment success . This research present develop virtual environment ( VE ) simultaneously connect physiological signal device acquisition allows , biofeedback , chemically dependents consciousness vulnerability front different situation 'risk ' , without direct assessment therapist . Developed 3d Max® software , VE compose scenario object habit chemically dependent individual 's daily life . The interaction environment accomplish use Human-Computer Interface ( HCI ) convert incoming physiological signal indicate anxiety state command change scene . Anxiety characterized average variability heart respiratory rate 30 volunteer undergoing stress environment situation . To evaluate effectiveness VE biofeedback chemically dependent 's vulnerability front situation risk , total 50 volunteer drug user , monitor 10 therapist , enrol . Prior VE , result demonstrate poor correlation therapist ' prediction chemically dependent individual . After exposure VE , significant increase 73 % awareness risk relapse chemically dependent individual , confirm hypothesis VE couple biofeedback device may assist therapist treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>2.1 Ethical approval Approval obtain Local Ethics Committee ( CAAE-0094.0.237.000-07 , process CEP/UMC-093/2007 ) participant . They inform methodology confidentiality personal information . The participant inform methodology confidentiality personal information . All procedure perform write informed consent participant . 2.2 Study Participants To determine limit normal emotional anxious , thirty volunteer male 's adult ( GL ) age range 20 50 year recruit . None pathology associate anxiety psychiatric disorder , none drug user take medication . Three mental health professional ( PG1 ) , specialized chemical dependency , evaluate emotional state volunteer . A second group fifty adult volunteer ( DG ) ( mean age 35±10.02 year ) ongoing outpatient chemical dependency clinic [ treatment average 's population : 5 month 14 day ] . The patient abstain drug use least two month , select test VE . None DG 's participant pathology associate anxiety psychiatric disorder , none take medication . The DG volunteer narcotic user two illicit drug , alcohol , marijuana , tobacco , cocaine crack cocaine . Addiction alcohol tobacco 72 % 56 % respectively . The group 's percentage use psychoactive drug , 70 % cocaine crack cocaine 32 % marijuana . For group , 10 mental health professional ( PG2 ) , therapist , specialized chemical dependency responsible monitoring group 's treatment assess emotional state . To elaborate scenario characterize character virtual environment ( VE ) , another eight specialist professional ( PG3 ) chemical dependency field recommend situation , place , object , sign , cue think trigger crave . 2.4 Testing Protocol Prior CDI test , therapist answer questionnaire identifying situation risk present VE could lead patient relapse . The questionnaire also complete CDI VE test . In addition , application structure base risk factor survey . The question present listed : 1 . If receive phone call friend drug user , would stimulate take drug ? 2 . If walk place use sell drug area , would relapse chance ? 3 . If colleague invite drink , would favor take drug ? 4 . Family issue situation family absent , would contribute relapse ? 5 . Would relapse chance go party place might drug ? 6 . A friendship drug user offer would trigger wish drug ? The questionnaire VE test apply CDI single day morning . The patient present therapist perform test . The test conduct comfortable room part therapeutic community CDIs . This room hold test equipment , support table equipment , chair patient therapist . Communication test recommend . Extra care take avoid test ' interruption include disturbance cause equipment ( air conditioning , audio , etc . ) well people enter exam room . Regarding sensor , cardiac frequency meter place distal phalanx little finger respiratory rate ( RR ) sensor near right nostril use headset support . The CDIs inform outcome situation present VE would correspond physiological state facing risk situation . Their question answer , emotion show influence scenario . The test start volunteer watch desired film select basal level physiological signal simultaneously acquire . It follow introduction develop VE heart respiratory rate measure minute compare previously acquire baseline level . The script automatically select scene depend identified emotional state . When state identify anxious , program change scene , show character use drug . Otherwise , plot proceed .</detailed_description>
