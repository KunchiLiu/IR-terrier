	<detailed_description>Trauma lead cause death person young 40 year . Hemorrhage etiology 30 % death , remain leading cause potentially preventable mortality ( 66-80 % ) battlefield . Death secondary hemorrhagic shock occur surgical bleeding coagulopathy . Due knowledge increase fibrinolysis promote hypocoagulable state severe trauma , trial perform determine antifibrinolytics tranexamic acid ( TXA ) could reduce morbidity mortality reduce death hemorrhage . TXA antifibrinolytic inhibits plasminogen activation plasmin activity , thus prevent clot break-down rather promote new clot formation . Despite extensive use TXA many surgical population increase use severe trauma patient , TXA FDA approve indication patient traumatic injury . The effect TXA immune function thoroughly examine , especially patient severe traumatic injury . The study effect TXA use endothelial activation injury also important due inter-relationship coagulation endothelial function . Endothelial injury secondary local hypoperfusion cause acute traumatic coagulopathy fibrinolysis . Therefore thorough comprehensive evaluation effect TXA immune , coagulation , endothelial parameter important allow well understanding mechanisms action agent . This randomized placebo control trial obtain mechanism action data , pharmacokinetic information , efficacy safety data use TXA severely injure trauma patient . Participants randomize 1 3 treatment arm ( 1:1:1 ) : TXA 2 gram IV bolus , TXA 4 gram IV bolus , placebo . The study period time enrollment hospital discharge transfer . The study intervention occur upon enrollment trial . Participants receive study drug within two hour initial injury . Blood sample draw multiple time point immune parameter , Pharmacodynamics , repository sample . Immune parameter sample draw approximately 0 , 6 , 24 72 hour study drug/placebo administration . Pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic sample draw accord two schedule . Even number sample time , blood drawn approximate time point : 0 , 20 min , 1 hr , 2 hr , 4 hr , 6 hr , 8 hr , 12 hr . A patient sample odd number sample time sample draw approximate time point : 0 , 10 min , 40 min , 1.5 hr , 3 hr , 6 hr , 10 hr 24 hr . Repository sample draw approximate time point : 0 , 1 , 6 , 24 , 72 hour .</detailed_description>
