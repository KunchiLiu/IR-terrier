	<brief_summary>Platinum-based chemotherapy regard standard first-line treatment patient advance urothelial carcinoma ( UC ) . However , patient fail response experienced progression platinum-based chemotherapy grim prognosis standard salvage treatment available . UC known harbor multiple mutation . In investigator ' high-throughput molecular profiling study , commonly observe mutation include TP53 , FGFR3 ( fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 ) HRAS . Since RAS signal attenuate use selective farnesyl transferase ( FTase ) inhibitor , tipifarnib , highly potent selective inhibitor FTase , propose effective therapeutic approach treatment UC .</brief_summary>
