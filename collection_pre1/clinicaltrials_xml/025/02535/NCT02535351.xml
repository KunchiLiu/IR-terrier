	<detailed_description>Two randomized trial cytokine era clearly show CN role mRCC increase life expectancy . The survival benefit TKIs include first-line sunitinib pazopanib mRCC demonstrate , majority patient enrol pivotal phase III study undergo nephrectomy.Therefore unknown similar survival benefit could achieve without CN new target agent . At time need good understand mechanism primary secondary resistance TKIs mRCC patient identify eight prognostic predictive biomarkers well define risk factor potentially druggable target . The hypothesis study CN follow TKIs improve overall survival ( OS ) compare TKIs alone subject mRCC . Circulating blood biomarkers ( CBBs ) promise become non-invasive real-time surrogate tissue-based biomarkers . Circulating tumor cell ( CTCs ) shed primary tumor metastasis , circulate tumor DNA ( ctDNA ) release bloodstream die tumor cell , likely capture entire tumor heterogeneity provide clear picture tumor genetic landscape . Moreover , CTCs fluctuation reflect possibly anticipate treatment outcome . Through comparison CBBs disease become refractory therapy , investigator would able address challenge research question regard TKIs resistance mechanism . This study design compare clinical benefit measure Overall Survival ( OS ) , progression-free survival ( PFS ) , overall response rate ( ORR ) safety provide CN follow TKIs v upfront TKIs mRCC subjects.To prospectively collect blood sample patient commencement TKIs therapy development resistance , purpose analyze CTCs ctDNA mutational profile highlight mechanism underlie TKIs resistance . The investigator additionally aim assess role CTCs prognostic pharmacodynamic biomarkers prospectively collect demographic clinical outcome data molecular pathological analysis measure clinical endpoint . Rationale TKIs treatment choice : Pazopanib sunitinib compare therapy previously untreated patient mRCC within phase 3 non inferiority COMPARZ trial represent first-ever head-to-head comparison first-line treatment mRCC . Overall , median PFS OS pazopanib compare sunitinib statistically non-inferior , show agent active provide similar high quality care . For reason TKI assign base patient characteristic accord guideline every single institution involve study . Statistical plan : The sample size calculate order compare 5-year OS subject randomize receive CN follow TKIs subject randomize receive TKIs ( main study endpoint ) . A total 191 death yield 80 % power detect hazard ratio 1.5 TKIs vs. CN follow TKIs overall type 1 error 0.05 ( two-sided log-rank test ) . Such hazard ratio ( HR ) correspond increase 5-year OS , anticipate value 10 % TKIs 21.5 % CN follow TKIs . The investigator estimate approximately 270 patient ( 135 arm ) , recruit 3 year minimum follow 2 year , necessary see necessary number death . An interim analysis OS base O'Brien-Fleming stop rule plan 96 death approximately 34 month randomisation .</detailed_description>
