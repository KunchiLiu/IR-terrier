	<brief_summary>Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) fifth common third lead cause death cancer worldwide1 . Hepatectomy still main effective treatment HCC accompany well-preserved cirrhosis liver transplantation feasible due lack donor Recurrence tumor within liver remnant also common , report 5-year recurrence rate 50-70 % , patient undergo `` curative '' hepatectomy . Management recurrent HCC still urgent several treatment develop . Repeat hepatectomy consider first choice recurrent HCC 5-year survival rate 19.4 56 % . Unfortunately , repeat hepatectomy perform small proportion patient HCC recurrence due poor functional liver reserve widespread recurrence . With 3-year survival rate 62 % 68 % treatment , radiofreqency ablation ( RFA ) use effective treatment recurrent HCC . The efficacy RFA recurrent HCC report comparable achieve surgery . Laparoscopic surgery consider suitable treatment recurrent HCC due postoperative adhesion make laparoscopic surgical procedure difficult less safe . Recently , several study report laparoscopic surgery recurrent HCC cirrhotic patient safe feasible procedure good short-term outcome . By far , study perform compare efficacy safety laparoscopic surgery RFA treatment recurrent HCC .</brief_summary>
