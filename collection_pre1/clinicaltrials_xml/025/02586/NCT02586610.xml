	<brief_summary>This phase II , prospective open label multi-center study subject stage II-III rectal cancer accrue order determine pathological complete response rate neoadjuvant pembrolizumab combination chemoradiation treatment ( CRT ) . Subjects must diagnosis rectal cancer , stage II ( T3-4 , N0 ) stage III ( T , N1-2 ) . Subjects must receive prior treatment ( chemotherapy , pelvic radiation surgery ) rectal cancer . Eligible subject receive standard chemoradiation pembrolizumab administer every 3 week day 1 , 22 , 43 neoadjuvant interval . In subject , restaging endorectal pelvic MRI chest abdominal CT perform 6-8 week completion neoadjuvant treatment determine resectability rule evidence metastasis . Subjects resectable disease undergo surgery within 2-4 week image ; 8-12 week completion chemoradiation . Subjects find unresectable metastatic disease post treatment combination CRT+ pembrolizumab receive standard care definitive treatment per discretion treat physician .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OUTLINE : This multi-center study . NEOADJUVANT TREATMENT : All subject receive concurrent chemoradiation pembrolizumab neoadjuvant treatment 6 week : - Pembrolizumab 200 mg Intravenously ( IV ) Days 1 , 22 43 - Capecitabine 825 mg/m2 PO ( mouth ) twice daily dos ( daily total 1650 mg/m2 ) 5 consecutive day / week Monday-Friday give radiation day 28 day - Radiation 50.4 Gy ( Gray ) daily fraction 1.8 Gy 6 week interval , exclude weekend POST NEOADJUVANT TREATMENT : - End treatment ( EOT ) 6-8 week last dose neoadjuvant treatment , subject assess determine resectability . Those resectable disease undergo surgery within 2-4 week image , 8-12 week completion chemoradiation . Subjects find unresectable metastatic disease post treatment combination CRT+ pembrolizumab receive standard care definitive treatment per discretion treat physician . - Surgical Resection ( 2-4 week restaging image 8-12 week completion chemoradiation ) - Follow Up - Post Operative Visit ( 4-6 week surgery ) - Disease Follow Up -Years 1-2 ( per site investigator discretion ; suggest every 3-6 month ) - Survival Follow Up - Years 3-5 To demonstrate adequate organ function , screen lab perform within 7 day treatment initiation : Hematological : - Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥1,500 /mcL - Platelets ≥100,000 / mcL - Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL without transfusion erythropoietin ( EPO ) dependency ( within 7 day assessment ) Renal : - Serum creatinine ≤1.5 X upper limit normal ( ULN ) OR - Measured calculated creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min subject creatinine level &gt; 1.5 X institutional ULN Glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) also use place creatinine CrCl Hepatic : - Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X ULN - Aspartate transaminase ( AST ) / Serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase ( SGOT ) ≤ 2.5 X ULN - Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) / Serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 X ULN - Albumin ≥2.5 mg/dL Coagulation : - International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) Prothrombin Time ( PT ) ≤1.5 X ULN unless subject receive anticoagulant therapy ( long PT PTT within therapeutic range intend use anticoagulant ) - Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time ( aPTT ) ≤1.5 X ULN unless subject receive anticoagulant therapy ( long PT PTT within therapeutic range intend use anticoagulant )</detailed_description>

Be 18 year age old day signing inform consent . Have measurable disease base Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors 1.1 ( RECIST 1.1 ) . Be willing provide tissue newly obtain core excisional biopsy tumor lesion . Have performance status 01 Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance Scale . Female subject childbearing potential negative urine serum pregnancy within 72 hour prior receive first dose study treatment . If urine test positive confirm negative , serum pregnancy test require . Female subject childbearing potential willing use 2 method birth control surgically sterile , abstain heterosexual activity course study 120 day last dose study treatment . Subjects childbearing potential surgically sterilize free menses &gt; 1 year . Male subject agree use adequate method contraception start first dose study therapy 120 day last dose study treatment . Subject Unresectable disease , evidence invading adjacent organ surgical resection achieve negative margin Recurrent rectal cancer Evidence metastatic disease ( determine chest abdominal CT ) . Prior malignancy within prior 5 year . Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma skin squamous cell carcinoma skin undergone potentially curative therapy situ cervical cancer . Prior radiation diagnosis expect rectal cancer treatment field . Prior surgery , radiation , chemotherapy , target therapy , investigational therapy rectal cancer . NOTE : If subject receive major surgery reason rectal cancer , must recover adequately toxicity and/or complication intervention prior start therapy . Prior therapy antiPD1 , antiPDL1 , antiPDL2 agent . Diagnosis immunodeficiency receive systemic steroid therapy form immunosuppressive therapy within 7 day prior plan start study treatment . Known history Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) ( HIV 1/2 antibody ) . Known active Hepatitis B ( e.g. , HBsAg reactive ) Hepatitis C ( e.g. , HCV RNA [ qualitative ] detect ) . Administration live vaccine within 30 day plan start study therapy . Seasonal influenza vaccine injection generally inactivate flu vaccine allow ; however intranasal influenza vaccine ( e.g. , FluMist® ) live attenuate vaccine , allow . Known history active TB ( Bacillus Tuberculosis ) Hypersensitivity pembrolizumab excipients . Active autoimmune disease require systemic treatment past 2 year ( i.e. , use disease modify agent , corticosteroid immunosuppressive drug ) . Replacement therapy ( eg. , thyroxine , insulin , physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy adrenal pituitary insufficiency , etc . ) consider form systemic treatment . Known history , evidence active , noninfectious pneumonitis . Active infection require systemic therapy . History current evidence condition , therapy , laboratory abnormality might confound result trial , interfere subject 's participation full duration trial , best interest subject participate , opinion site investigator . Known psychiatric substance abuse disorder would interfere cooperation requirement trial .
