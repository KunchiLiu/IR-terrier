	<brief_summary>The primary objective study assess safety intravitreal aflibercept injection treat visually compromise radiation maculopathy secondary treatment uveal melanoma iodione-125 brachytherapy . The study consist two arm 25 patient ( total 50 patient ) . Subjects arm 1 undergo treatment every 6 week . Subjects arm 2 undergo treatment improvement document follow evaluation next treatment extend two week .

	<brief_title>Role Intravitreal Aflibercept Injection Treatment Radiation Maculopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study consist 2 simultaneous treatment arm : A six week dose regimen arm treat extend ( TAE ) dose regimen arm , total duration 54 week . In TAE arm patient receive intravitreal aflibercept injection first visit , second visit 6 week , begin treat extend second injection forward . Treatment give visit . Patients improved radiation maculopathy ( SD-OCT analysis ) extend re-evaluation two week ( e.g . first interval 6 week ; second interval 10 week ; third interval 12 week , etc ) . Patients increase radiation maculopathy ( SD-OCT analysis ) re-evaluation decrease one week . Both arm consist 25 subject ( eye ) . Fluorescein angiography complete baseline , 4th injection ( within three week week 24 TAE arm ) , end study patient . Spectral domain OCT , clinical evaluation include visual acuity assess every visit patient . Radiation maculopathy grade every visit patient blind fashion use follow classification system : Grade 1 indicates extrafoveal , noncystoid edema ; grade 2 , extrafoveal cystoid edema ; grade 3 , foveal noncystoid edema ; grade 4 , mild-to-moderate foveal cystoid edema ; grade 5 , severe foveal cystoid edema grade 6 subretinal fluid . All patient undergo comprehensive evaluation include adverse event question study timepoint . Patients six-week dose arm receive total 9 intravitreal aflibercept injection study window TAE treatment group receive maximum 9 minimum 5 .</detailed_description>

Must receive previous treatment radiation maculopathy within last 426 week 4 . Any presence macular edema ( evaluated SDOCT ) cause radiation retinopathy 5 . Willing able comply clinic visit studyrelated procedure 6 . Provide sign informed consent A patient meet follow criterion exclude study : 1 . Patients le 21 year age . 2 . Patients mental disability condition precludes acquisition sdOCT image ( nystagmus , neck disease , etc . ) 3 .
