	<brief_summary>Diabetic foot ulceration ( DFU ) common complication 25 % lifetime risk patient diabetes . While ulcer treat successfully outpatient basis , persist become infect . Nearly one fifth patient lower-extremity diabetic ulcer require amputation affect limb , result staggering cost patient healthcare system . Therapies promote rapid complete healing reduce need expensive surgical procedure impact cost substantially . The standard care treatment diabetic foot ulcer removable cast walker ( RCW ) . RCW use demonstrate plantar pressure reduction yet typically perceived compliance issue due removable nature . In address limitation , modify version RCW develop wrap layer cohesive plaster bandage . This technique term `` instant '' total contact cast ( iTCC ) derive seldom-used , gold standard treatment , total contact cast ( TCC ) . While ease application potential clinical equivalence clear benefit , iTCC carry disadvantage account irremovability . For example , frequent dressing change impractical , yet may necessary complex wound care . The goal research continue inquiry innovation basic aspect care , whilst address limitation past research failure domain . The investigator propose examine capability SurroSense RxTM smart insole smartwatch system ( Orpyx Medical Technologies Inc. , Calgary AB ) manage monitor adherence plantar pressure offload alert-based feedback . The insole embed pressure sensor , wirelessly communicate smartwatch provide feedback modify activity pressure profile time . This smartwatch transmit audio , visual , tactile notification excessive pressure-time threshold plantar region interest meet . This feedback allow patient educate plantar pressure , engage caregiver manage adherence offloading . The investigator also propose compare heal rate active neuropathic ulcer use RCWs couple SurroSense RxTM smart insole system ass whether adjunctive use two intervention improve efficiency neuropathic ulcer treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pressure offload lynchpin neuropathic ulcer care . Multiple method statically reduce pressure employ , various degree success , ulcer care continuum . Traditional offloading intervention redistribute load plantar surface , include : non-removable device ( total contact cast , removable walker render non-removable , cast shoe ) , removable device ( walker , forefoot offloading shoe , half shoe , bivalve total contact cast , therapeutic shoe ) 1,2,3 . A Cochrane Review use offload treatment uncomplicated neuropathic plantar ulcer give efficacy device type term percentage ulcer heal time require healing4 . The total contact cast find effective removable device many randomize controlled trial , percentage neuropathic ulcer heal time require healing5,6,7 . Ninety-two percent neuropathic ulcer heal average 6 weeks8 . Removable walker make non-removable may effective total contact casts9,10,11 . The effectiveness forefoot offloading shoe , half-shoes , cast shoe heal neuropathic forefoot ulcer need confirm prospective trials12 . The low efficacy prescribe removable device could attributable low adherence recommend use13 . The effectiveness offload intervention intimately link skin reperfusion see persistent external pressure alleviate . Key modifiable parameter mitigate tissue damage neuropathic foot pressure time . Kosiak report 1959 `` microscopic pathologic change note tissue subject little 60 mmHg one hour '' 14,15 . More recently , exposures 15 min one hour pressure great 240 mmHg , two hour pressure great 67 mmHg , find cause cell death rat muscle tissue16 . Despite , limited information regard efficacy intervention aim preventing pressure ulcer ; comprehensive review literature find enough evidence recommend reposition frequency17 . A consensus document international review pressure ulcer prevention state `` patient confine wheelchair taught reposition every 15 minute '' 18 . While establish pressure offload intervention able statically reduce pressure active ulcer , provide dynamic relief pressure . Since neuropathy characterize loss protective sensation ( LOPS ) , patient often unaware sustained pressure specific anatomic region time . Even static offload instrument , conceivable critical pressure time threshold dynamically exceed without patient 's knowledge ability address problem . Taken together , literature provide support development system monitor pressure time key location , provide alert-based feedback guide as-needed , patient-based offloading use patient active ulceration . The SurroSense Rx system ( Orpyx Medical Technologies Inc. , Calgary , AB ) patent pending ( US Publication # 20120109013 PCT WO/2012/055029 ) footwear system design aid prevention plantar pressure ulceration re-ulceration treatment active ulcer neuropathic patient . It comprise two pressure-sensing insert smartwatch display device . The device alert user `` safe '' pressure time threshold exceed ; current threshold base general clinical understanding pressure ulcer formation , indicate conservative threshold would &gt; 30-50mmHg &gt; 15 minute . For review literature , please refer Appendix 4 . As plantar pressure outcome data collect time , threshold may modify future iteration product . These threshold keep constant duration study question . The device measure plantar pressure discrete point correspond bony prominence would consider high risk ulceration : first metatarsal head ( 1 ) , lateral metatarsal head ( 2 ) , great toe ( 1 ) , lateral toe ( 1 ) , lateral foot ( 2 ) , heel ( 1 ) . These area select base inherent high risk neuropathic ulceration anatomic location . This data track , analysis perform collect last 15 minute . If &gt; 95 % measurement take pressure sensor 15-minute scan window exceed 30-50 mmHg , alert send user via smartwatch guide appropriately offload area . The proof concept design platform supplement management diabetic foot ulcer ( DFU ) assess context randomized clinical trial ( RCT ) pilot . Our hypothesis propose technology : 1 . Accelerate wound heal process ( i.e . success complete wound heal within 16 week , time heal , rate wound size change , complication rate ) ; 2 . Improve adherence RCW use ( measured hour use per day ) ; 3 . Improve offload ( i.e . term pressure-time interval ) . 4 . Upon wound closure , prevent incidence plantar ulcer recurrence . Eligible subject randomize Experimental Arm , Control Arm A Control Arm B ( 25 per arm ) . The experimental group provide active ( alert ) SurroSense RxTM device fit standardized RCW* ( Rebound® Diabetic Walker , Össur , Iceland ) . Control Group A provide inactive ( non-alerting ) version SurroSense RxTM device fit standardized RCW . Control Group B provide inactive version SurroSense RxTM device fit standardized RCW secure device-specific tie ; act iTCC device purpose trial . Patients arm provide New Balance 928 shoe wear contralateral foot ensure optimal device performance . All patient assess baseline every week successful wound heal 16 week , whichever come first . Following wound resolution , patient follow assigned device , use pair New Balance 928 shoe provide patient , 6 month ulcer recurrence . After 6 month , device discontinue , time patient follow additional 12 month ulcer recurrence . Should patient 's wound remain unresolved 16 week , continue use assign device subsequent 6-month period . If wound resolution occur 6-month period , patient switch New Balance 928 shoe remainder period ; however , wound resolution occur time , patient withdrawn study prior commencement subsequent 12-month observation period . For research subject wear SurroSense RxTM , device measure plantar pressure adherence prescribe offload . All group fit Jawbone UP Activity Trackers ( equivalent activity tracker ) monitor activity throughout study . *The removable Rebound® Diabetic Walker insole heat-moldable : heat ( 3 minute 110°C/230°F ) form patient ' foot ( patient stand sock heat insole 1 minute - hexagon remove appropriate ) . This method improve weight distribution plantar foot provide good offload ulcer site , recommend optimal treatment . Primary aim study : - This pilot study investigate efficacy SurroSense RxTM system expedite heal active neuropathic ulcer term rate wound area reduction . - It also investigate system 's potential improve heal rate treatment active neuropathic ulcer use practical RCWs . - It also investigate system 's potential prevent recurrent ulceration post ulcer resolution . To achieve , follow wound resolution , patient follow 18 month ( first 6 month assign device ) monitor ulcer recurrence . Secondary aim study : - Compare complete wind heal 16 week experimental versus control group - Compare heal time rate function patient 's baseline Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument ( MNSI ) Modified Neuropathy Disability Score ( MNDS ) 19 experimental versus control group - Compare change MNDS course study - Performance cost-effectiveness analysis experimental versus control group 's method treat diabetic ulcer - Elucidate pressure data adherence parameter ( activity data—including step count type activity , peak pressure , number alert , measure central tendency time offload , area alert generation , hour use per day ) patient , compare data patient experimental versus control group - Compare area ulceration area SurroSense RxTM device alert generation ( active device ) would-be alert generation ( inactive device ) - Compare pressure data adherence parameter ( activity data—including step count type activity , peak pressure , number alert , measure central tendency time offload , area alert generation , hour use per day ) MNSI MNDS Scales - Examine ability pressure data adherence parameter predict heal - Comparison complication rate experimental versus control group</detailed_description>
