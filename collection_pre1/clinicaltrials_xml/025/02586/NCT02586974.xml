	<brief_title>Effects Warmed , Humidified CO2 Insufflation Body Core Temperature Cytokine Response</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Among possible consequence cool dry gas insufflation laparoscopic procedure hypothermia cytokine response , might cause significant perioperative morbidity . More detail , body core temperature decrease laparoscopic surgery calculate human 0.3 °C every 50 L cold dry insufflation gas . The reported temperature drop cause redistribution heat heat loss , non-specific ( due anaesthesia environmental patient exposure ) specific ( due peritoneal dry cool insufflation ) . The result hypothermia severe , particularly prolong surgery . As cytokine response , increase several pro-inflammatory cytokine describe follow irritate effect peritoneal CO2 insufflation . That say , various device condition insufflate gas investigate reduce specific heat loss result peritoneal insufflation , well evaluate inflammatory response . Previous study conduct animal model clinical setting suggest warmed humidified insufflation allow improved maintenance body core temperature , reduction degree inflammatory response improve quality postoperative course , compare standard insufflating gas . These finding , however , still conclusive confirm adequate randomize , control trial . Furthermore , device provide warm humidification demonstrate conclusive advantage standard cold dry gas term prevention hypothermia laparoscopy man . On basis current available study favour warm humidified insufflation , investigator hypothesize new device providing warm humidified insufflation ( Humigard® Fisher Paykel Healthcare® ) might achieve significant benefit standard insufflation term body core temperature maintenance . The investigator also expect document decrease pro-inflammatory cytokine , response diminish peritoneal irritation .</detailed_description>
