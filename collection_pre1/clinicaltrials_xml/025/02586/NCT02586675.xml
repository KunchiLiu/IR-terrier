	<brief_summary>The purpose study find investigational drug Ribociclib ( LEE011 ) , take standard treatment ( Tamoxifen +/- Goserelin ) safe beneficial effect pre-menopausal post-menopausal woman men type breast cancer know hormone receptor positive/HER2- breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TEEL Study- Phase 1 Tamoxifen Ribociclib ( LEE011 ) Advanced ER+ ( HER2 Negative ) Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase I Dose Escalation : The phase I portion study dose escalation confirm safety combination determine Maximum Tolerated Dose ( MTD ) Recommended Phase II Dose ( RP2D ) ribociclib Tamoxifen . Phase I conduct participant Hormone Receptor Positive ( HR+ ) /Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2 Negative ( HER2- ) locally advanced metastatic breast cancer prior endocrine therapy three prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen administer metastatic locally advanced setting . Phase Ib Dose Expansion : Phase I trials increasingly include dose-expansion cohort ( Ib ) maximum-tolerated dose reach well characterize toxicity profile identify early sign efficacy within specific disease population . The investigator ' goal ass anti-tumor activity Ribociclib + Tamoxifen evaluate safety adult patient HR+/HER2- locally advance metastatic breast cancer . Patients phase 1b expansion exclusion inclusion criterion except allow two line cytotoxic chemotherapy metastatic setting .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically and/or cytologically confirm diagnosis Estrogen ReceptorPositive ( ER+ ) and/or Progesterone ReceptorPositive ( PR+ ) breast cancer local laboratory . Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2 Negative ( HER2 ) breast cancer define negative situ hybridization test Immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) status 0 , 1+ 2+ . If IHC 2+ , negative In Situ Hybridization ( Fluorescence [ FISH ] , Chromogenic [ CISH ] , Silver [ SISH ] ) test require local laboratory test . Participants allow ( require ) two line prior chemotherapy regimen metastatic set dose expansion phase . For dose escalation cohort , three previous line chemotherapy metastatic setting acceptable . Measurable disease , i.e. , least one measurable lesion per Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 criterion *for expansion cohort . For *escalation cohort , bone disease allow . For expansion cohort , must measurable disease state . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status ( ECOG PS ) 0 1 . Written informed consent must obtain prior screen procedure accord local guideline . Adequate bone marrow organ function . Must able swallow ribociclib Tamoxifen capsules/tablets . PreMenopausal Women Eligibility : 1 ) Premenopausal woman receive adjuvant Aromatase Inhibitor Ovarian Suppression ( AI + OS ) adjuvant set complete least 12 month hormonal therapy . 2 ) Premenopausal woman de novo metastatic disease eligible prior endocrine therapy . 3 ) Premenopausal woman receive Tamoxifen metastatic setting , receive two line chemotherapy . PostMenopausal Women Men Eligibility : 1 ) Postmenopausal woman men progress firstline second line therapy aromatase inhibitor metastatic setting . 2 ) Postmenopausal woman men recur completion adjuvant treatment aromatase inhibitor ( complete least one year AI adjuvant set progression AI ) . 3 ) Postmenopausal woman men consider candidate treatment aromatase inhibitory oncologist , patient willing go AI , patient intolerant AI . Postmenopausal woman men allow ( require ) two line prior chemotherapy regimen metastatic set dose expansion phase . For dose escalation cohort , three previous line chemotherapy metastatic setting acceptable . Potential participant inflammatory breast cancer . Prior CDK 4/6 inhibitor exposure . Have receive Tamoxifen metastatic setting ( 30 day ) progress Tamoxifen adjuvant setting . Known hypersensitivity ribociclib excipients tamoxifen . A concurrent malignancy malignancy within 3 year start study drug , exception adequately treat , basal squamous cell carcinoma , nonmelanomatous skin cancer curatively resect cervical cancer . Central nervous system ( CNS ) involvement unless specific criterion meet . Impairment Gastrointestinal ( GI ) function GI disease may significantly alter absorption study drug ( e.g. , ulcerative disease , uncontrolled nausea , vomit , diarrhea , malabsorption syndrome , small bowel resection ) . Known history HIV infection ( test mandatory ) . Any concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition would , investigator 's judgment , cause unacceptable safety risk , contraindicate patient participation clinical study compromise compliance protocol ( e.g . chronic pancreatitis , chronic active hepatitis , active untreated uncontrolled fungal , bacterial viral infection , etc. ) . Clinically significant , uncontrolled heart disease and/or recent event specify study protocol Currently receive follow medication discontinue 7 day prior start study drug : . Known strong inducer inhibitor CYP3A4/5 , include grapefruit , grapefruit hybrid , pummelo , starfruit , Seville oranges . b . That narrow therapeutic window predominantly metabolize CYP3A4/5 . c. That know risk prolong QT interval induce Torsades de Pointes . d. Herbal preparations/medications , dietary supplement prescribe M.D.. Currently receive receive systemic corticosteroid ≤2 week prior start study drug , fully recover side effect treatment . The following us corticosteroid permit : single dos , topical application ( e.g. , rash ) , inhale spray ( e.g. , obstructive airway disease ) , eye drop local injection ( e.g. , intraarticular ) . Currently receive warfarin coumarinderived anticoagulant treatment , prophylaxis otherwise . Therapy heparin , low molecular weight heparin ( LMWH ) fondaparinux allow . Participation prior investigational study within 30 day prior enrollment.. Has receive radiotherapy ≤ 4 week limited field radiation palliation ≤ 2 week prior start study drug , recover grade 1 well related side effect therapy ( exception include alopecia ) and/or ≥ 25 % bone marrow irradiate . Has major surgery within 14 day prior start study drug recover major side effect ( tumor biopsy consider major surgery ) . Has recover toxicity relate prior anticancer therapy NCI Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version 4.03 Grade equal less 1 ( Exception criterion : patient grade alopecia allow enter study ) .
