	<detailed_description>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) currently fourth lead cause death U.S. expect become third lead cause death 2020 . Morbidity mortality COPD result largely acute exacerbation , responsible 1.5 million ED visit 750,000 hospitalization per year U.S . The optimization respiratory management acute exacerbation represent fundamental challenge improve prognosis reduce mortality . The value non-invasive ventilation ( NIV ) severe acute exacerbation COPD formally demonstrate randomized clinical trial . In set severe COPD exacerbation , NIV actually largely employed , largely ahead invasive mechanical ventilation . While hospital mortality patient treat NIV decrease year , currently less 10 % , mortality patient treat invasive ventilation remain high 25 % . Mortality patient treat invasive ventilation failure NIV seem grow actually close 30 % . To improve prognosis patient acute exacerbation COPD require invasive mechanical ventilation therefore major challenge term morbidity mortality . Among mean available achieve goal , minimally invasive extracorporeal CO2 removal ( ECCO2R ) seem promising approach . The investigator hypothesize addition minimally invasive ECCO2R likely limit dynamic hyperinflation COPD patient require invasive ventilation acute exacerbation , improve gas exchange . If confirm , could imply rapid wean invasive ventilation relation : - less hemodynamic consequence positive pressure ventilation - reduce risk baro-volo trauma lung parenchyma - reduction use sedative drug - chest configuration minimize diaphragmatic flattening , therefore favor generation high trans-diaphragmatic pressure - decrease work breathing ( WOB ) , connection previous point decrease alveolar ventilation require pulmonary CO2 elimination ECCO2R treatment All elements clinically relevant , reduction duration invasive ventilation associate literature decrease incidence pneumonia associate mechanical ventilation , well decrease duration ICU-stay .</detailed_description>
