	<brief_title>The I-Score Study : Developing New Patient-Reported Tool Routine HIV Care Patients Antiretroviral Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This 24-month study aim develop validate theoretically found patient-reported outcome measure use routine HIV care patient antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) . Eight clinical site involve ( 4 Canada 4 France ) . The measure centre patient ' report barrier ART adherence adapt administration via electronic tablet . The study four main step . The psychometric validation tool core study conduct Step 3 . The Observational -Prospective design applies field test retest phase Step 3 . The four step nevertheless describe . Step 1 -Development measure 's conceptual framework ( Start : October 2015 ) 1 . A scoping review exist HIV-specific patient-reported outcome measure 2 . A meta-ethnography qualitative research HIV-positive person ' report barrier antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) adherence 3 . A content analysis qualitative interview HIV-positive patient ART perceive barrier adherence ( n = 30 patient ) The meta-ethnography content analysis serve develop conceptual framework tool base . It define tool 's conceptual domain outline relationship concept verify statistically part tool 's validation . Once framework complete , measure specify bank item generate . Step 2 -Linguistic validation preliminary measure The tool 's linguistic validation involve professional harmonization English French version creation universal French version adapt French site . Step 3 - Exploration validation measure 's psychometric property 1 . During pilot phase , administer measure measure small sample size ( n = 80 ) conduct number `` cognitive interview `` participant ( n = 8 ) . This mainly help improve measure field test phase ( e.g. , examine miss data , incoherent response , problem question comprehension ) . 2 . The field test ( n = 160 ) do revise measure pilot phase include exploratory confirmatory analysis examine , among aspect , correspondence collect data conceptual framework develop Step 1 . Here also examine sub-dimensions measure verify concurrent ( e.g. , viral load , intention adhere ART ) , convergent ( e.g. , beliefs antiretroviral medication ) discriminant ( e.g. , quality life ) validities tool . 3 . For retest phase , field test participant recall either 1 week 4 week later another round data collection assess measure 's reliability . In phase additional measure include previous phase include questionnaire ( adherence ART ) . This new measure use verify predictive validity tool . Step 4 -Pilot clinical use instrument Here , finalized tool apply clinical set small sample HIV-positive patient ART ( n = 24 ) clinician ( n = 8 ) .The aim collect data tool 's perceived utility perspective population order provide initial assessment feasibility tool 's wide implementation . Statistical analysis plan Statistical analysis quantitative pilot test phase ( n = 80 ) - Response coherence - Analysis item score distribution - Analysis miss data - Principal component analyse Statistical analysis field test phase ( n = 160 ) - Exploratory analyse - Confirmatory analyse - Verification measure 's convergent , discriminant concurrent validity Statistical analyse retest phase ( random sample n = 160 ) - Principal component analysis internal consistency Cronbach 's alpha order verify whether factor obtain retest phase obtain field test phase - Descriptive statistic multivariate analysis carry order compare score mean verify whether factor associate I-score phase 2 3 Statistical analysis Pilot instrument 's clinical use ( n = 24 patient ; n = 8 HIV clinician ) - The statistic produce step study descriptive ( e.g. , percentage , average ) comparative . For comparative analysis patient doctor ( e.g. , tool 's appreciation ) , test adapt accord whether variable use continuous ( e.g. , t-tests ) categorical ( e.g. , chi-square ) . - Furthermore , patient clinician data analyze multi-level model examine , example , patient appreciation ( non-appreciation ) tool associate difference clinician ' perception ( estimation individual structural factor associate appreciation non-appreciation ) .</detailed_description>
