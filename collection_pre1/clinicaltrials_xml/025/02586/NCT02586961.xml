	<brief_title>Nebulized Adrenalin Oral Betamethasone Children With Bronchiolitis Attending Pediatric Emergencies .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : In infancy , bronchiolitis common acute infection lower respiratory tract often cause respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) . The current treatment bronchiolitis controversial . Although meta-analysis nebulized bronchodilator corticosteroids treatment fail show consistent benefit admission rate , remain widely use pediatric emergency ward . A recent randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , clinical trial factorial design conduct determine whether treatment nebulized epinephrine , short course high dose oral Betamethasone , , result clinically important decrease hospital admission among infant bronchiolitis see emergency department . This study show infant epinephrine-betamethasone group significantly less likely placebo group admit day 7 ( relative risk , 0.65 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.45 0.95 , P = 0.02 ) . However , adjustment multiple comparison , result become insignificant ( P = 0.07 ) . This synergistic interaction anticipate give hope association nebulized epinephrine - short course oral high dose betamethasone might reduce risk hospitalization infant consult pediatric emergency moderate severe acute bronchiolitis . It therefore require conduct trial dedicate evaluation French population . Hypothesis : use Epinephrine-Betamethasone allows reduce rate hospitalization mild-to-severe acute viral bronchiolitis see pediatric emergency department .</detailed_description>
