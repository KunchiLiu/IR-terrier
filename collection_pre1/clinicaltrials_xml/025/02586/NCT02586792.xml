	<brief_summary>The study open-label phase 2 clinical trial single dose inactivate H7N9 influenza vaccine ( non-adjuvanted ) . The subject study previously participate DMID trial 07-0023 , evaluate inactivate Influenza A/H7N7 vaccine . In previous study healthy adult 18 40 year old randomize receive two dos , 28 day apart , placebo 7.5 , 15 , 45 , 90 ug influenza vaccine IM injection 1:1 ratio ( N=25/vaccine group 25 placebo group ) . The primary objective 1 ) ass safety reactogenicity single dose A/H7N9 vaccine individual previously receive two IM dos A/H7N7 vaccine A/H7 vaccine-naïve 2 ) To assess serum hemagglutination inhibition ( HAI ) antibody responses A/H7N9 approximately 28 day follow receipt single dose A/H7N9 vaccine individual previously receive two IM dos A/H7N7 vaccine A/H7 vaccine-naïve .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This Phase II , open-label study 50 male non-pregnant female , 19 50 year old , inclusive , good health meet entry criterion . The study design assess safety , reactogenicity , immunogenicity single dose monovalent inactivate influenza A/H7N9 virus vaccine ( 45 mcg HA/0.75 mL ) manufacture Sanofi Pasteur administer healthy adult previously receive two dos monovalent inactivated influenza A/H7N7 virus vaccine manufacture Sanofi Pasteur one two dos placebo Protocol 07-0023 . All subject receive single dose inactivate influenza A/H7N9 vaccine deliver intramuscularly . Reactogenicity measure occurrence solicit injection site systemic reaction time study vaccination Day 1/Visit 01 8 day study vaccination . Unsolicited non-serious adverse event ( AEs ) collect time study vaccination roughly 28 day study vaccination . Serious adverse event ( SAEs ) new-onset chronic medical condition collect time study vaccination roughly 6 month study vaccination . Immunogenicity test A/H7N9 A/H7N7 antigens include perform hemagglutination inhibition ( HAI ) neutralizing ( Neut ) antibody assay serum obtain immediately prior study vaccination , roughly 8 28 day study vaccination . An additional 60 mL venous blood drawn immediately prior study vaccination , roughly 8 28 day study vaccination exploratory cellular immunology assay . The duration study subject roughly 6 month . The primary objective 1. assess safety reactogenicity single dose monovalent inactivate influenza A/H7N9 virus vaccine individual previously receive two intramuscular dos monovalent inactivate influenza A/H7N7 virus vaccine A/H7 vaccine-naïve . 2 . To assess serum hemagglutination inhibition ( HAI ) antibody responses A/H7N9 roughly 28 day follow receipt single dose monovalent inactivate influenza A/H7N9 virus vaccine individual previously receive two intramuscular dos monovalent inactivate influenza A/H7N7 virus vaccine A/H7 vaccine-naïve . The secondary objective 1 . To assess study-vaccine related unsolicited non-serious adverse event follow receipt one dose monovalent inactivate influenza A/H7N9 virus vaccine individual previously receive two intramuscular dos monovalent inactivate influenza A/H7N7 virus vaccine A/H7 vaccine-naïve . 2 . To assess new-onset chronic medical condition follow receipt one dose monovalent inactivate influenza A/H7N9 virus vaccine individual previously receive two intramuscular dos monovalent inactivate influenza A/H7N7 virus vaccine A/H7 vaccine-naïve.3 ) To assess serum HAI antibody responses A/H7N9 baseline 8 day follow receipt single dose monovalent inactivate influenza A/H7N9 virus vaccine individual previously receive two intramuscular dos monovalent inactivate influenza A/H7N7 virus vaccine A/H7 vaccine-naïve . 4 . To assess serum neutralizing ( Neut ) antibody responses A/H7N9 baseline roughly 8 28 day follow receipt one dose monovalent inactivate influenza A/H7N7 virus vaccine A/H7 vaccine-naïve .</detailed_description>
