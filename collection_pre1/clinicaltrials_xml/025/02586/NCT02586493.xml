	<brief_summary>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) preventable treatable disease characterize airflow limitation fully reversible . The mainstay treatment involve use inhaled medication , include short and/or long-acting bronchodilator along inhaled corticosteroid . For inhaled medication , choice inhalation device important consideration inadequate technique reduces effect inhalation . Therefore , development easy-to-use inhaler delivers drug lung effectively , important . This study ass correct use ELLIPTA inhaler subject COPD ass ease use ELLIPTA inhaler , rat subject determine use inhaler correctly . Study divide two visit i.e . Screening/Visit 1 ( day 1 ) Visit 2 ( Day 28 +/-2 ) phone call Day 8+/-2 day Visit 1 ass safety . In multi-center , single-arm , randomise ( receive one two version ELLIPTA inhaler Ease Use questionnaire ) , open-label , placebo study , subject never use ELLIPTA inhaler establish diagnosis COPD receive COPD therapy able demonstrate correct use ELLIPTA inhaler Visit 1 consider eligible participate study . Approximately 252 subject screen expectation 208 subject complete study demonstrate correct ELLIPTA inhaler use visit 2 . ELLIPTA register trademark GlaxoSmithKline Group Companies .</brief_summary>

Severity Disease : Post albuterol/salbutamol force expiratory volume one second ( FEV1 ) / force vital capacity ( FVC ) ratio &lt; 0.70 FEV1 &lt; =70 % predict obtain within two year Visit 1 . Smoking History : Current former ( defined subject quit smoke least 3 month prior Screening/Visit 1 ) cigarette smoker &gt; 10 packyear smoke history ( Number pack year = [ number cigarette per day divide 20 ] x number year smoke [ e.g. , 10 packyears equal 20 cigarette per day 10 year , 10 cigarette per day 20 year ] ) . Current COPD Therapy : Currently receive maintenance ( one longacting bronchodilator , longacting muscarinic antagonist ( LAMA ; also know longacting anticholinergic ) longacting beta 2agonist ( LABA ) inhaler therapy ( prior ongoing use ELLIPTA inhaler ) treatment COPD . Subjects must able continue use currently prescribe COPD maintenance inhaler therapy throughout study need short act betaadrenergic agonist ( SABA ) rescue use . Ability Use Inhalers : Subject must able demonstrate correct use ELLIPTA inhaler within three attempt Visit 1 . Males Females pregnant plan pregnancy study lactate . Informed Consent : Capable give sign dated write informed consent include compliance requirement restriction list consent form protocol . Subject understand willing , able , likely comply study procedure restriction . Subject must able read , comprehend , record information English . A subject eligible inclusion study follow criterion apply Asthma : Subjects current primary diagnosis asthma . COPD medication : Receiving inhale shortacting betaadrenergic agonist , i.e. , albuterol daily COPD therapy ( need [ prn ] regularly schedule ) ; Has change maintenance COPD treatment within 4 week prior Screening/Visit 1 plan change COPD treatment within 4 week Visit 1 . COPD/Exacerbations/Hospitalization : Subjects experience COPD exacerbation require systemic corticosteroid ( oral , parenteral depot ) and/or antibiotic within four week Visit 1 . A subject must hospitalization COPD within three month prior Visit 1 ; Subjects uncontrolled COPD , investigator 's judgment would affect subject 's ability evaluate `` ease use correct use '' . Other Respiratory Disorders : Subjects respiratory disorder , include active tuberculosis , lung cancer , bronchiectasis , sarcoidosis , lung fibrosis , pulmonary hypertension , interstitial lung disease active pulmonary disease . Lung Resection : Subjects lung volume reduction surgery within 12 month prior Screening/Visit 1 . Oxygen : Use longterm oxygen therapy ( LTOT ; define oxygen therapy prescribe great 12 hour per day ) nocturnal oxygen . Other Disease Abnormalities : Historical current evidence clinically significant rapidly progress unstable cardiovascular , neurological , renal , hepatic , immunological , endocrine ( include uncontrolled diabetes thyroid disease ) haematological abnormality uncontrolled . Significant define disease , opinion investigator , would put safety subject risk participation , would affect analysis disease/condition exacerbate study ; Subjects history psychiatric disease , intellectual deficiency , poor motivation condition limit validity inform consent participate study . Compliance : Subjects risk noncompliance , unable comply study procedure , unable continue current COPD medication . Alcohol Drug Abuse : A know suspected history alcohol drug abuse within last 2 year . A history hypersensitivity component study inhaler ( e.g. , lactose , magnesium stearate ) . In addition , patient history severe milk protein allergy , opinion study physician , contraindicate participation also exclude . Prior Ongoing use ELLIPTA inhaler ( include investigational commercially available product ) . Investigational Product : Subjects receive investigational drug and/or medical device within 30 day entry study ( Screening/Visit 1 ) , within five drug halflives investigational drug , whichever longer .</criteria>
