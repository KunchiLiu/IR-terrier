	<brief_summary>Asthma chronic disease lung characterize airway inflammation , bronchoconstriction increase airway responsiveness . Inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS ) , alone combination inhale long-acting beta-adrenergic agonist ( LABA ) , consider mainstay treatment treatment . For inhaled medication , choice inhalation device important consideration inadequate technique reduces delivery medicine effect inhalation . Therefore , development easy-to-use inhaler delivers drug lung effectively , important . This study design assess correct use ELLIPTA inhaler subject asthma also assess ease use ELLIPTA inhaler , rat subject determine use inhaler correctly . Study divide two visit i.e . Screening/Visit 1 ( day 1 ) Visit 2 ( Day 28 +/-2 ) phone call Day 8+/-2 day Visit 1 ass safety . In multi-center , single-arm , randomise ( receive one two version ELLIPTA inhaler Ease Use questionnaire ) , open-label , placebo study , subject never use ELLIPTA inhaler establish diagnosis asthma receive asthma therapy able demonstrate correct use ELLIPTA inhaler Visit 1 consider eligible participate study . Approximately 252 subject screen expectation 208 subject complete study demonstrate correct ELLIPTA inhaler use visit 2 . ELLIPTA register trademark GlaxoSmithKline Group Companies .</brief_summary>

Subjects must able continue use currently prescribe asthma maintenance inhaler therapy throughout study need short act betaadrenergic agonist ( SABA ) rescue use . Ability Use Inhalers : Subject must able demonstrate correct use ELLIPTA inhaler within three attempt Visit 1 . Males Females pregnant plan pregnancy study lactate .

Subject understand willing , able , likely comply study procedure restriction . Subject must able read , comprehend , record information English . A subject eligible inclusion study follow criterion apply Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) : Subjects current diagnosis COPD . Asthma medication : Receiving inhale shortacting betaadrenergic agonist , i.e. , albuterol daily asthma therapy ( need [ prn ] regularly schedule ) . Has change maintenance asthma treatment within 4 week prior Screening/Visit 1 plan change asthma treatment within 4 week Visit 1 . Asthma/Exacerbations/Hospitalization : Any asthma exacerbation , define deterioration asthma require use systemic corticosteroid ( oral , parenteral depot ) within 4 week Visit 1 . A subject must hospitalisation emergency department visit due asthma within 3 month Visit 1 . Subjects poorly control unstable asthma , investigator 's judgment would affect subject 's ability evaluate `` ease use correct use '' .
