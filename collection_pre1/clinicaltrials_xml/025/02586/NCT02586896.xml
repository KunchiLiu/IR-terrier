	<brief_title>Comparing Interventions Opioid Dependent Patients Presenting Medical Emergency Departments</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As addiction treatment become increasingly integrated medical care system , two model rightly receive great deal attention . The first use Screening , Brief Intervention , Referral Treatment ( SBIRT ) model identify case , provide therapeutic contact , refer severe case longer-term care . The second treatment addiction use medical model treatment , include implement primary care setting . Much less attention pay optimize strategy bridge gap SBIRT intensive/longer-term treatment severe end spectrum . This factor critical importance opioid dependent patient , whose need meet brief intervention brief treatment . Emergency room intervention substance use disorder largely limited brief interventions/SBIRT model , focus primarily alcohol . Although substantial literature document value case management link drug user treatment , approach apply drug user emergency department ( ED ) set . In sample opioid dependent patient see medical ED currently engage treatment , study compare effect brief strengths-based case management ( SBCM ) effect screen , assessment referral alone . Participants meet DSM-IV criterion opioid dependence randomly assign ( 150 per group ) receive 1 ) Screening , Assessment Referral 2 ) 6 session SBCM base model previously implement Rapp colleague prior study . Staff blind treatment condition complete follow-up assessment 3 6 month . Aims study identify main effect SBCM substance abuse treatment initiation engagement , use opioids drug , broad measure health life functioning ; examine interaction treatment assignment select participant attribute predict treatment initiation , engagement , substance use outcome ; examine effect treatment involvement substance use outcomes two treatment group . The propose study first trial use case management approach link drug dependent patient present EDs longer-term addiction treatment . It one first trial focus specifically opioid dependent patient medical EDs . A innovative feature case management approach emphasize linkage pharmacotherapy , facilitate linkage office-based buprenorphine , methadone , naltrexone patient desire treatment .</detailed_description>
