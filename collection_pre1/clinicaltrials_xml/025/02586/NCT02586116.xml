	<brief_summary>This post-market , prospective , randomized clinical investigation evaluate performance nanOss Cervical Interbody Fusion ( IBF ) device nanOss Bioactive Bone Void Filler treatment cervical disc disease . A secondary objective compare performance nanOss Cervical IBF Device nanOss Bioactive Bone Void Filler performance C-Plus PEEK IBF Device autograft . This study enroll 40 patient one ( 1 ) site . After subject sign informed consent , randomly assign either nanOss Cervical IBF device arm C-Plus PEEK IBF Device . Patients complete preoperative visit examination . Patients evaluate discharge , six ( 6 ) week , three ( 3 ) month , six ( 6 ) month , twelve ( 12 ) month . Patients evaluate twenty-four ( 24 ) month post-operatively demonstrate fusion 12 month time point .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison nanOss Cervical IBF System C-Plus PEEK IBF Device With Autograft</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The nanOss Cervical Interbody Fusion Device CE-marked single level intervertebral body fusion C3 T1 treatment cervical disc disease . The nanOss IBF device design used one device per level , graft material supplemental fixation . nanOss BABone Void Filler resorbable porous calcium phosphate bone void filler use bone graft substitute bone void filler . It CE mark use bone void filler spine , re-hydrated Bone Marrow Aspirate ( BMA ) alone , mixture patient 's BMA autograft . The C-Plus PEEK IBF Device indicate use skeletally mature adult one level cervical spine , C3 T1 , treatment cervical disc disease . The device use patient six week non-operative treatment . Autogenous bone graft place within central cavity C-Plus PEEK IBF Device . The SlimFuse Cervical Plate System components titanium alloy plate screw design temporarily provide resistance flexion , extension , lateral bend axial rotation strength stiffness cervical spine ( C2-C7 ) order promote cervical fusion . The anterior approach use implant SlimFuse Cervical Plate System . The primary goal study evaluate outcome nanOss Cervical IBF Device C-Plus PEEK IBF Device . The primary endpoint objectively determine via x-rays CT scan ass fusion . Secondary endpoint include subjective patient score neck arm pain quality life along analysis proportion patient experience treatment failure .</detailed_description>
