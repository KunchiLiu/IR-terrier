	<brief_title>Effect S-Adenosyl Methionine Treatment Recurrence After Curative Resection Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) major health problem . Although recent advance treatment HCC significantly improve prognosis patient HCC , overall survival rate still unsatisfactory ; 5-year survival rate 50-70 % even curative treatment hepatic resection percutaneous radiofrequency ablation . One reason poor prognosis HCC high rate recurrence.However , anti-relapse treatment remain press work . In recent year , study report S-Adenosyl Methionine impact promote apoptosis inhibit growth breast cancer , colon cancer , gastric cancer liver cancer vitro vivo . In study , aim examine whether S-Adenosyl Methionine effect improve patient ' recurrence curative resection Hepatocellular Carcinoma .</detailed_description>
