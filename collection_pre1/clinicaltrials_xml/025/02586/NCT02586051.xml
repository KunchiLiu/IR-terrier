Participants enrol two cohort receive either one ( Cohort 1 ) two ( Cohort 2 ) obinutuzumab infusion . Both cohort receive standard pretreatments reduce risk infusion-related reaction ( IRRs ) . In Cohort 1 , 5 participant receive single dose obinutuzumab IV infusion Day 1 . Following review Cohort 1 aggregate safety data 4 week post dose last participant cohort 1 , cohort 2 allow proceed . In Cohort 2 , 20 participant receive obinutuzumab IV infusion Days 1 15 . Participants qualify transplantation receive compatible kidney offer inclusion Cohort 1 Cohort 2 receive two additional infusion ( one time transplantation second Week 24 post-transplantation ) obinutuzumab . Assessment safety tolerability obinutuzumab regimen conduct Week 24 desensitization phase Week 28 post-transplantation .
