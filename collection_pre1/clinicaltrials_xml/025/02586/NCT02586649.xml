	<brief_summary>Respiratory complication lead cause death initial year acute SCI , third lead cause death thereafter . Complete partial loss respiratory muscle innervation individual cervical high thoracic injury lead inadequate ventilation inability effectively clear secretion , often prompt supportive ventilation follow initial injury . Development atelactasis , pneumonias respiratory failure common respiratory complication observe acute phase injury . It well known restrictive ventilatory defect , dependent upon level completeness injury , apparent individual chronic cervical SCI . Respiratory functional impairment might compromise individual , majority share many aspect obstructive airway physiology commonly associate asthma . The asthma-like feature individual chronic cervical SCI demonstrate hypothesize due override cholinergic airway tone carry intact vagal ( parasympathetic ) nerve fiber arise brainstem , whereas sympathetic innervation interrupt level upper thoracic spinal cord . Whether airway narrow AHR chronic cervical SCI also relate chronic airway inflammation unknown , although conceivable repeated respiratory infection , possibly , neurogenic component , could contribute chronic airway inflammation . Therefore , investigator aim assess long-acting bronchodilator ( tiotropium bromide ) affect various index lung function , include : pulmonary function test , level inflammation cough strength across 24 hour receive study drug . Results analyze baseline , 1 hour , 3 hour , 20 hour 24 hour post drug inhalation active medication non-active placebo .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In addition restrictive ventilatory defect stem respiratory muscle paralysis , cervical SCI ( tetraplegia ) associate obstructive airway physiology similar associate asthma . The investigator hypothesize aspect obstructive physiology stem unopposed increase cholinergic airway tone result autonomic imbalance ; vagal innervation ( cholinergic neurotransmission ) lungs intact , bronchodilating adrenergic influence sympathetic pathway interrupt . The investigator demonstrate use spirometric criterion , significant bronchodilator response approximately 50 % subject tetraplegia follow inhalation short act beta-2 agonist ( albuterol sulfate ) anticholinergic agent ( ipratropium bromide ) . When specific airway conductance ( sGaw ) , sensitive indicator bronchodilation , assess via whole body plethysmography , significant bronchodilation restoration normal airway caliber note subject . Intuitively , one might expect bronchodilation susceptible individual tetraplegia already compromise respiratory muscle strength weaken cough might benefit good airway clearance , via increase lung volume improve length-tension relationship residual expiratory muscle initiation forceful cough . Based upon comparative study bronchodilator effect ipratropium bromide versus albuterol person tetraplegia ( publication ) , appear ipratropium bromide elicit great bronchodilation , perhaps specificity action block acetylcholine bind muscarinic-3 ( M3 ) airway smooth muscle receptor . The investigator purpose preliminary study ass whether salutary effect upon pulmonary function , cough strength , airway inflammation observe across twenty-four hour period follow inhalation single dose tiotropium bromide 18 mcg inhalational capsule versus placebo utilize double-blind crossover design person chronic stable tetraplegia .</detailed_description>
