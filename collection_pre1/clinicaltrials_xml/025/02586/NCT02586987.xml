	<detailed_description>This Phase I , open-label , multi-centre , drug combination study double triple combination oral selumetinib ( AZD6244 Hyd-sulfate ) plus intravenous ( IV ) MEDI4736 oral selumetinib plus IV MEDI4736 IV tremelimumab patient advance solid tumour refractory standard therapy standard therapy exist . The safety , tolerability , preliminary anti-tumour activity ascend dos Selumetinib ( AZD6244 Hyd-sulfate ) Combination MEDI4736 Selumetinib Combination MEDI4736 Tremelimumab investigate . Once safety tolerability establish relevant dose , expansion cohort commence order evaluate safety , tolerability , provide preliminary evaluation mechanism action anti-tumour activity drug combination . Mandatory paired biopsy expansion cohort tumour-type specific . Expansion cohort open independently double triple combination treatment .</detailed_description>
