	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether bromodomain extraterminal domain ( BET ) inhibition treatment RVX000222 high-risk type 2 diabetes mellitus patient coronary artery disease increase time major adverse cardiovascular event .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect RVX000222 Time Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events High-Risk T2DM Subjects With CAD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The majority ( 75 % ) death subject diabetes mellitus ( DM ) due atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . Recent study suggest major adverse cardiovascular event ( MACE ) rate &gt; 11 % 18 month type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) despite baseline LDL-C &lt; 2.1 mmol/L . Bromodomains ( BRDs ) family evolutionary conserve protein-interaction module play key function chromatin organization regulation gene transcription . One recognize family bromodomain-containing protein bromodomain extra-terminal ( BET ) family . BET inhibition represent novel , epigenetic approach treat CAD . RVX000222 affect biological process important atherosclerosis acute coronary event via selective inhibition BET proteins . RVX000222 available capsule formulation standard excipients establish stability . The BETonMACE study focus prevention subsequent MACE subject CAD DM high intensity statin therapy co-medication .</detailed_description>
