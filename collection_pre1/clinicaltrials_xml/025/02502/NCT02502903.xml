	<detailed_description>Study TNT009-01 First Human ( FIH ) study use Integrated Protocol Design . This Phase 1 study protocol comprise three sub-parts : Single Ascending Dose ( SAD ) Multiple Ascending Dose ( MAD ) study normal male female human volunteer ( NHVs ) , Multiple Dose ( MD ) study patient various complement-mediated disorder confine single disease therapeutic area . Although patient represent population diverse set clinical diagnosis united common mechanism disease match mechanism action TNT009 . Several key safety measure incorporate design study , include use Sentinel Dosing Groups independent Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) , well appropriate program prophylactic vaccination clinical biomarker surveillance related risk potentially associate inhibition complement system .</detailed_description>
