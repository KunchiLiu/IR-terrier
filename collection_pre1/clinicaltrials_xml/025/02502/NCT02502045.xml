	<brief_title>Effect Therapeutic Light Sleep , Circadian Rhythm , Global Function Women With Alzheimer 's</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The impact disturb sleep cognition functional domain vitally important study order increase understand Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) phenomenology . Research show severity sleep disturbance dementia advance parallel possibly manner amenable therapeutic intervention . In AD , sleep disruption characterize change sleep architecture . It contention neuropathology specific AD alters circadian system suprachiasmatic nucleus ( SCN ) . Environmental light powerful regulator circadian system,4,5 know significant regulatory effect pineal melatonin synthesis secretion via SCN multisynaptic pathway downstream SCN . This study explore efficacy particular type therapeutic light intervention regulate circadian system AD , use data analytic method capable detect change multiple time scale . Our central hypothesis properly-timed light exposure individual AD synchronize disorganize circadian sleep-wake rhythm improve functional plasticity [ approximate entropy ( ApEn ) , fractal dimension ( FD ) ] , thereby result increase sleep efficiency ( SE ) , reduction sleep fragmentation ( SF ) , reduce excessive daytime sleepiness ( EDS ) dementia-related behavior , improvement cognition daytime behavior . Women nearly twice likely men develop AD due long life expectance emerge evidence . In light increase risk also enhance aspect biological uniformity study , project investigate woman AD .</detailed_description>
