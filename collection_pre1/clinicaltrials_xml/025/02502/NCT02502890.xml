	<detailed_description>This study prospective , longitudinal , nested case-control study design identify change gene transcription predictive associate asthma exacerbation child age 6 17 year difficult-to-control , exacerbation-prone asthma . Participants follow prospectively onset cold subsequent asthma exacerbation . An internet-based asthma cold symptom diary access participant use hand-held device . When participant report development cold , clinic visit schedule soon possible ( within 48 hour cold symptom onset ) collect blood nasal sample . A second clinic visit occur 4-6 day onset cold symptom obtain sample initial cold , prior use systemic corticosteroid .
