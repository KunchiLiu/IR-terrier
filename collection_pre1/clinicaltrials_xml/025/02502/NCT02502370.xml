	<brief_summary>The utility adjuvant chemotherapy management Small Bowel Adenocarcinoma ( SBA ) remain unproven awaits result large , global , prospective , phase III , randomise , control trial . Across 830 million population North America Europe , approximately 3,000 patient stage I-III SBA every year would potentially eligible adjuvant chemotherapy trial . Given absence good-quality evidence-based data , agree trial consider adjuvant chemotherapy versus chemotherapy appropriate patient stage I-III SBA oncologist patient feel benefit adjuvant chemotherapy uncertain . For patient stage I-III SBA , oncologists , feel potential benefit adjuvant chemotherapy certain ( hence willing accept randomisation 'no chemotherapy ' arm ) , randomisation single agent fluoropyrimidine versus doublet fluoropyrimidine oxaliplatin chemotherapy offer . Tumour stage use stratification factor . Those patient consent randomise offer registration allow collection demographic , clinicopathological survival data , thereby make optimal use rare patient population available . In addition , archival Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded ( FFPE ) tissue contemporaneous venous blood sample collect every registered patient allow molecular profiling future translational research . A questionnaire underlying risk factor ( e.g . Crohn 's disease , coeliac disease , Lynch syndrome etc ) complete along collect data register patient .</brief_summary>
