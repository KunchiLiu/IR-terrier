	<brief_title>Comparing Opium Tincture ( OT ) With Methadone Substitution Treatment Opioid Dependence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose : To compare efficacy safety opium tincture ( OT ) methadone syrup maintenance treatment individual opioid-dependence . Justification : Currently , methadone gold standard maintenance treatment opioid use disorder . Opium tincture ( OT ) could potential new treatment alternative opioid dependence disorder , promise solution address follow issue : 1 . Alternative treatment option As single treatment effective individual opioid dependence , sufficiently diverse treatment option available . Currently , treatment option opioid dependence always effective address addiction , neither treatment offer base client ' choice , even current gold standard substitution drug , methadone . 2 . Avoidance overdose methadone : The long-acting nature methadone , narrow therapeutic window , high potency associate lack standard conversion ratio drug , could result fatal overdose . In contrast , OT short half-life lower potency compare methadone , account low incidence fatal overdose , especially patient high risk overdose currently prescribe medication . Thus , OT could add treatment option current available treatment Buprenorphine/ Naloxone maintenance treatment patient high risk overdose . 3 . Prolonged QT syndrome methadone : Maintenance treatment methadone cause serious , potentially fatal adverse effect cardiac electrical conduction system lead prolonged QT interval predispose patient arrhythmias . As , cardiac conduction co-morbidity ( relative ) contraindication use methadone maintenance treatment . Thus , OT could add treatment option current available treatment buprenorphine levomethadone maintenance treatment patient cardiac conduction defect . 4 . Opium dependence pattern substance use To date , study maintenance treatment opioid dependence mostly carry population heroin predominant substance use comparatively few data opium dependent patient . Opium tincture could treatment choice geographic area high prevalence opium dependence predominant pattern substance use , Iran Asian country . 5 . Traditional medicine cultural acceptance : Being traditional herbal remedy pain , opium tincture appear culturally acceptable alternative methadone part Southeast Asia . 6 . Cost effectiveness : Possible cost effectiveness OT treatment opioid use disorder make potential treatment choice efficacy safety profile could demonstrate RCT . Research method : recruitment strategy : Following method use recruit participant : 1 ) Brochures flyer distribute community outreach , general mental hospital , NGO-run community , college university , drop-in center specialize clinic treatment participant HIV hepatitis C 2 ) Posters ( content brochures flyer ) study stuck billboard bus/subway , local store , hospital , NGO-run community , college university , well specialized health-care center psychiatry addiction treatment 3 ) two main NGO-run community Tehran treat opiate dependent patient Tehran . Investigators use initial contact letter recruit new patient attend community receive treatment . Sample size : Sample size calculation base non-inferiority design . In study , investigator aim evaluate OT less effective term retention ( primary outcome ) gold standard , methadone . Previous clinical trial methadone 's 3- month retention rate primary outcome , demonstrate rate approximately 80 % . Setting type Ι error 0.05 power 80 % clinically acceptable margin 10 % , calculated sample size equal 100 participant treatment group . Considering dropout rate 20 % , total sample size 240 , 120 participant randomize group study . Statistical analysis plan : Retention treatment compare two group use Fisher 's exact test consider P value ≤ 0.05 significant . Secondary outcome compare two group use Fisher 's exact test , independent sample T-test One-way ANOVA test applicable . Prediction outcome variable base generalized linear model generalize estimating equation ( GEE ) model .</detailed_description>
