	<brief_summary>Prognostic factor Inflammatory Bowel Diseases ( IBD ) currently mainly base clinical factor ( disease extension , perianal involvement , need surgery , use immunomodulatorsâ€¦ ) . All immunological marker ( serological ) IBD diagnostic role indeterminate colitis ( ulcerative colitis v crohn 's disease ) never consider predictor IBD course adult . Among used , anti-neutrophil cytoplasm antibody ( ANCA ) Anti-Saccaromyces cerevisiae antibody ( ASCA ) allow distinction ulcerative colitis ( ANCA+/ASCA- ) Crohn 's disease ( ANCA-/ASCA+ ) , combine use sensitivity specificity 85 % . However , 10 antibody identify recently evaluate individually IBD especially pediatric Crohn 's disease : anti-ompC , anti-I2 , anti-flagellins , anti-glycan ( anti-laminaribioside carbohydrate antibody ( ALCA ) , anti-mannobioside carbohydrate antibody ( AMCA ) , anti-chitobioside carbohydrate antibody ( ACCA ) , anti-chitin anti-laminarin ) , anti-goblet cell anti-C.albicans specific mannans antibody . These complementary test improve reliability diagnosis . In previous cross-sectional work cohort 195 IBD patient , investigator show prognostic role anti-glycan Abs especially correlation pejorative form disease Crohn 's disease Ulcerative Colitis ( UC ) prediction corticodependency IBD .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Anti-glycan Antibodies Stability Saint-Etienne IBD Cohort</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There data stability antibody , study cross-sectional . There conflict result among scarce longitudinal data . One study report negativation anti-glycan antibody case ASCA ANCA . On cohort 195 patient include first study , investigator would like assess 3 year immunological profile patient thus compare . In case modification serological status antibody , search associate factor ( clinical , biological therapeutic ) perform . In case sero-negativation anti-glycan antibody , could link decrease normalization increase intestinal permeability IBD . Indeed , subgroup patient , test hypothesis analyze intestinal permeability anti-glycan positive group 2 sample group sero-negativation second sample .</detailed_description>
