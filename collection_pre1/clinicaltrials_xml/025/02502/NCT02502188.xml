	<detailed_description>This 2-part study conduct multiple study center . Part 1 randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled study evaluate safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics CC-90005 follow single oral dose healthy subject . During course Part 1 , subject participate screening phase , baseline phase ( ) , treatment phase ( ) follow visit . There total 3 plan cohort , consist different dose level , 8 subject per cohort . In cohort , 6 subject receive dose CC 90005 2 subject receive placebo depend randomization schedule . Each cohort receive minimum 2 dos , one cohorts receive third dose ( three study period per cohort ) . Administration study drug next high dose level begin safety tolerability precede dose evaluate deem acceptable investigator sponsor 's medical monitor . Part 2 randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled study evaluate safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics CC-90005 follow multiple oral dos subject moderate severe plaque-type psoriasis . During course Part 2 , subject participate screening phase , baseline phase , treatment phase follow visit . There total 4 plan cohort , consist different dose level , 12 subject per cohort . In cohort , 9 subject receive dose CC-90005 3 subject receive placebo depend randomization schedule . It plan study drug administer twice daily 28 day .
