	<brief_title>Variability Response Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) commonly use treatment inflammatory pain . Pain highly subjective experience , select analgesic regimen provide optimal pain relief specific patient challenging . Moreover , patient often express preference particular NSAID , raise possibility efficacy relieve pain variable among individual . However never study systematically . The clinical decision-making process complicate recognition NSAIDs cause serious thrombotic adverse event patient ( 1 ) . Elucidating factor influence individual patient 's risk cardiovascular complication likelihood analgesic efficacy enable clinician prescribe NSAIDs rationally order maximize therapeutic benefit minimize risk adverse cardiovascular event . NSAIDs chemically diverse class therapeutic agent exert analgesic anti-inflammatory effect via inhibition cyclooxygenase ( COX ) -1 and/or COX-2 , enzymes catalyze first commit step prostaglandin ( PG ) synthesis . PGs produce diverse array biologic effect via activation prostanoid receptor , play important role variety pathologic homeostatic process ( 2 ) . COX-2 readily induce response pro-inflammatory stimulus consider primary source inflammatory PGs . In contrast , production PGs homeostatic function , gastric epithelium cytoprotection , ascribe COX-1 , constitutively express tissue ( 2 ) . Consequently , COX-2-selective NSAIDs , include rofecoxib , valdecoxib , celecoxib , develop order retain anti-inflammatory analgesic effect inhibition COX-2-derived PG formation , avoid gastrointestinal toxicity traditional NSAIDs ( i.e . aspirin , ibuprofen , naproxen , etc ) inhibit isoforms . Although few gastrointestinal complication observe clinical trial , treatment COX-2-selective NSAIDs increase risk serious cardiovascular adverse event , include myocardial infarction , stroke , heart failure ( 1,3 ) . The risk thrombotic event associate use NSAIDs , particularly selective COX-2 , mediate via suppression COX-2-derived prostacyclin formation endothelial vascular smooth muscle cell ( 4,5 ) . Prostacyclin possess potent anti-thrombotic vasodilatory effect , thus act general inhibitor platelet activation vivo ( 2 ) . Traditional NSAIDs also inhibit COX-2 vasculature , associate risk thrombosis mitigate extent inhibition formation thromboxane A2 ( TxA2 ) , COX-1-derived PG release activated platelet promote platelet activation aggregation ( 1,3 ) . Thus , risk thrombosis particular NSAID dependent upon relative selectivity COX-2 COX-1 ( 3,6 ) . In addition effect vascular PG production , NSAIDs inhibit renal PG formation , result sodium retention hypertension , may augment cardiovascular risk ( 1,3,7 ) . Currently , recommend NSAIDs avoid use limited duration patient classify high cardiovascular risk ( 8 ) . These recommendation support study demonstrate even short-term NSAID use increase incidence cardiovascular event patient undergo coronary artery bypass grafting ( 9,10 ) follow myocardial infarction ( 11,12 ) . However , long-term treatment COX-2-selective NSAIDs also increase incidence cardiovascular event patient consider low baseline risk ( 13,14 ) , consistent risk transformation due atherogenesis indicate traditional cardiovascular risk factor alone sufficient guide therapeutic decision . Thus , additional study necessary define comprehensively factor modify cardiovascular risk NSAID use facilitate progressive personalization NSAID therapy .</detailed_description>
