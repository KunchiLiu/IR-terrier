	<brief_summary>In stage 3 chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) risk death due cardiovascular cause high greatly exceed risk progression end stage renal failure . This high cardiovascular risk predominantly due sudden cardiac death heart failure , manifestation leave ventricular hypertrophy fibrosis . Aldosterone appear play important role causation myocardial disease direct inflammatory fibrotic myocardial effect via increase arterial stiffness due hypertrophy , inflammation , fibrosis within medium large artery . Levels aldosterone high CKD despite sodium overload treatment angiotensin-converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitor angiotensin receptor blocker ( ARB ) drug due twin phenomena aldosterone escape breakthrough . In previous British Heart Foundation fund study , Birmingham investigator show addition mineralocorticoid receptor blocker ( MRB ) spironolactone background therapy ACE inhibitor ARBs cause reduction prognostically important parameter arterial stiffness LV mass . Because spironolactone therapy also associate significant fall arterial pressure remain possible effect mediate simply blood pressure reduction . In multi-centre , randomise control study , effect treatment spironolactone LV mass arterial stiffness patient stage 3 CKD establish ACE ARB therapy compare chlortalidone , control anti-hypertensive agent . Early stage chronic kidney disease highly prevalent new , cost effective treatment strategy require reduce cardiovascular risk . This study design provide rationale large study morbidity mortality MRB therapy early stage CKD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background 1 . Chronic kidney disease cardiovascular disease CKD major poorly recognise under-treated risk factor cardiovascular disease . It categorise 5 stage accord GFR presence marker kidney damage . Stage 3 CKD , subject proposal , define glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) 30-59 ml/min/1.73m2 . There graded inverse relationship cardiovascular risk GFR independent age , sex risk factor . There also grade association albuminuria cardiovascular risk patient low GFR albuminuria , risk increase multiplicative association . While cardiovascular risk end stage CKD extreme , public health term burden resides early stage ( CKD stag 1-3 ) disease , prevalent affect almost 1 7 entire population , include approximately 4 % age 40-59 40 % 70 year . Thus , CKD potentially important risk factor cardiovascular disease general population . Although risks myocardial infarction manifestation coronary artery disease increase CKD , much great increase incidence heart failure sudden cardiac death stage 3-5 . This almost certainly reflection high prevalence myocardial disease ; leave ventricular hypertrophy ( LVH ) often accompany magnetic resonance image evidence fibrosis present 30 % patient stage 2 ( GFR 60-89 ) stage 3 CKD 80 % patient start renal replacement therapy . To date , prospective trial examine prognostic benefit drug therapy high risk group recently present SHARP trial . This show reduction occlusive vascular event associate LDL lower simvastatin ezetimibe . The Birmingham CRIB-2 study ( see ) publish 2010 provide evidence mineralocorticoid receptor blockade spironolactone exerts beneficial effect intermediate end point strong prognostic value include LV mass arterial stiffness . That work provide basis application . Pathophysiology myocardial vascular disease chronic kidney disease The main pathological feature cardiovascular disease CKD : 1 . Myocardial disease characterise LVH fibrosis accompany systolic diastolic dysfunction . 2 . Arterial wall thickening , stiffen calcification ( arteriosclerosis ) . 3 . Coronary peripheral artery atherosclerosis . Although doubt patient CKD subject accelerate atherosclerosis major pathological feature cardiovascular system CKD myocardial disease ( call uraemic cardiomyopathy ) arterial stiffen due arteriosclerosis . As kidney function decline , range abnormality occur may exert adverse effect upon cardiovascular system . Hypertension , chronic anaemia , oxidative stress , inflammation activation renin-angiotensin-aldosterone ( RAAS ) sympathetic nervous system appear contribute development atherosclerosis , arteriosclerosis myocardial hypertrophy fibrosis . 2 . Aldosterone Cardiovascular Disease The fundamental role RAAS cardiovascular disease apparent result many large ACE inhibitor trial show mortality benefit patient chronic heart failure , high risk , coronary artery disease . These beneficial effect attribute prevention multiple adverse effect angiotensin II . Strong evidence suggest aldosterone may also important mediator cardiac vascular damage many disease state . In trial involve patient chronic heart failure heart failure complicate myocardial infarction , addition MRBs - spironolactone ( RALES ) eplerenone ( EPHESUS EMPHASIS ) - standard therapy include ACE inhibition reduce mortality 30 % . Primary aldosteronism associate great LV mass high risk adverse cardiovascular event control hypertensive population patient myocardial infarction , plasma aldosterone concentration even within normal range predict adverse prognosis . More recently , study subject undergo coronary angiography confirm independent association plasma aldosterone level total cardiovascular mortality . The mechanisms action aldosterone include upregulation Angiotensin 1 receptor direct effect fibroblast collagen synthesis well decrease matrix metallo-proteinase secretion . An anti-fibrotic effect MRB therapy may major importance . After myocardial infarction , circulate marker collagen turnover fibrosis reduce MRB therapy RALES study myocardial collagen turnover significantly reduce spironolactone fall marker index related mortality benefit . In CKD stag 2 3 , data CRIB-2 show spironolactone improves myocardial diastolic function collagen turnover . . Use MRBs Patients CKD Although doubt remain whether ACE inhibitor ARBs superior blood pressure lower drug slow progression CKD , may provide marginal extra benefit widely recommend national international guideline . Conversely , traditional approach nephrologists MRB drug avoid use risk azotaemia hyperkalaemia . There theoretical empirical reason avoidance may incorrect . Firstly , CKD characterise abnormal combination chronic sodium overload high ( unsuppressed ) level circulate aldosterone ; normal relationship circulating volume aldosterone secretion appear alter ( aldosterone escape ) . Secondly , large proportion patient CKD standard treatment ACE inhibitor ARBs , aldosterone 'breakthrough ' aldosterone level high despite inhibition system prevention angiotensin II formation inhibition angiotensin receptor . Thus patient CKD expose high level aldosterone despite standard treatment . The common disease state high aldosterone production continue occur face sodium overload chronic heart failure MRB therapy major prognostic benefit reduce adverse cardiovascular event total mortality . There also accumulate evidence suggest addition MRBs ACE inhibitor CKD might beneficial effect slow otherwise progressive decline renal function . Animal experiment show aldosterone mediate renal injury MRBs eplerenone effectively reduce . MRBs remain effective low aldosterone model CKD probably reflect importance local ( paracrine ) aldosterone synthesis . In human , small study suggest addition MRBs ACE inhibitor ARB reduces proteinuria may slow progression renal disease . Thus , widespread use MRBs CKD advocate even term 'renal aspirin ' . Until publication CRIB-2 trial however , little attention pay potentially beneficial effect MRB therapy cardiovascular system patient CKD . The CRIB-2 trial The Effect Spironolactone Left Ventricular Mass Aortic Stiffness Early-Stage Chronic Kidney Disease ; Randomised Controlled Trial In placebo control double blind trial , 112 patient ( mean age 54 year ) stage 2 3 CKD good blood pressure control establish treatment ACE inhibitor ARBs treat active run-in phase spironolactone 25 mg daily 4 week randomise continue spironolactone receive match placebo total 40 week . LV mass ( cardiac magnetic resonance ) arterial stiffness ( pulse wave velocity/analysis , aortic distensibility ) measure run 40 week treatment . Compared placebo , use spironolactone result large reduction LV mass arterial stiffness ( pulse wave velocity , augmentation index aortic distensibility ) . This trial well receive widely publicise . In recent review , Pitt state `` cautiously optimistic use MRB addition ACE inhibitor ARB reduce mortality morbidity associate CKD , well prevent progression end-stage renal disease health-care health-cost consequence '' . Thus , old inexpensive drug potential reduce adverse cardiovascular event mortality early stage CKD , risk factor screen routinely primary care measurement eGFR United Kingdom population . In CRIB-2 trial , systolic blood pressure significantly reduce ; spironolactone well recognised effective anti-hypertensive agent patient hypertension , even resistant drug . It therefore necessary determine whether improvement arterial stiffness LV mass occur spironolactone mediate effect . Furthermore , large scale clinical trial spironolactone contemplate , necessary demonstrate spironolactone use safely multi-centre trial design local monitoring renal function serum potassium . This study provide pilot data efficacy ( independent blood pressure ) safety necessary undertake definitive phase III trial role spironolactone reduce cardiovascular morbidity mortality patient early stage CKD . Recruitment sample size The trial start recruitment June 2014 , aim recruit 350 patient 2 year period . The study originally plan complete February 2017 . The rate recruitment however much slow anticipated become evident November 2015 would take 2 year reach target . This period time great funding allow decision take change study design . The initial design study use co-primary end point change LV mass change pulse wave velocity . A sample size 350 patient plan give 90 % power detect difference PWV p value 0.025 &gt; 90 % power detect change LV mass . When become evident achievable within funded time frame study re-designed use single end point change LV mass . With p value 0.05 power 85 % , calculate 63 patient per group would require . The sample size calculate 150 patient allow 15 % rate miss data . This allow small sample size achievable within funded time frame .</detailed_description>
