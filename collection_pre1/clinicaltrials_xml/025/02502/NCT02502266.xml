	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II/III trial study well cediranib maleate olaparib work give together separately , compare standard chemotherapy treat patient ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer return receive chemotherapy drug contain platinum ( platinum-resistant ) continue grow treat platinum-based chemotherapy drug ( platinum-refractory ) . Cediranib maleate olaparib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . It yet know whether give cediranib maleate olaparib together may cause damage cancer cell compare either drug alone standard chemotherapy .</brief_summary>

Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II ( CEDIRANIB MALEATE AND OLAPARIB ) : Patients receive cediranib maleate orally ( PO ) olaparib PO determine ongoing Phase I study . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM III ( CEDIRANIB ) : Patients receive cediranib maleate PO daily continuously . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM IV ( OLAPARIB ) : Patients receive olaparib PO twice daily ( BID ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PHASE III : Patients randomize 1 3 treatment arm . ARM I ( REFERENCE REGIMEN ) : Patients undergo physician 's choice standard care chemotherapy Phase II Arm I . ARM II ( CEDIRANIB AND OLAPARIB ) : Patients receive cediranib maleate PO olaparib PO Phase II Arm II . ARM III ( SINGLE AGENT ) : Patients receive either olaparib maleate PO cediranib PO , determine Phase II study . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
