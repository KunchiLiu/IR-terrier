	<brief_title>Pudendal Nerve Block Postoperative Posterior Repair Pain Relief</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pelvic Organ Prolapse ( POP ) occur 50 % woman childbirth . Common complication include urinary infection , postoperative pain , wound infection . The majority prolapse repair procedure carry general anaesthetic ( GA ) regular analgesia require post operatively . The pain often describe `` agonizing '' result substantial consumption analgesia , often lead extend period bladder catheterisation bowel dysfunction . Despite numerous attempt modify surgical technique anaesthetic regimen , problem persist . In attempt relieve problem local clinician promise result addition standardise preventive Pudendal Nerve Block ( PNB ) reduce post- op pain . To widen clinical utility procedure evidence base require . Preventive analgesia : Preventive analgesia broad term use describe analgesic regime give surgery control post - op pain aim reduce impact process know central sensitization . This refer increase synaptic efficacy somatosensory neuron follow tissue injury ( e.g . surgery ) nerve damage . This lead reduction pain threshold , amplification pain response spread pain sensitivity non-injured area result increase post -op pain intensity analgesic requirement . Preventive analgesic ( include nerve block ) incorporate range surgical procedure , recent review identify strong positive impact post-operative pain analgesic consumption . The Pudendal nerve mix nerve ( sensory motor ) derive somatic component sacral nerve root S2-S4 . It locate behind sacrospinous ligament . It supply anal urethral sphincter , pelvic floor muscle , anal perineal skin . PNB routine procedure use instrumental delivery obstetrics low-risk , low-cost anaesthetic technique effectively reduce perineal vaginal discomfort repair obstetric laceration . PNB also increasingly utilised preventive analgesia positive result pain relief , reduce analgesic , improve spontaneous micturition , less pain defecation shorter hospital stay pain follow haemorrhoidectomy . Improving post- operative pain relief enhance patient recovery fundamental importance individual National Health Service ( NHS ) . This study preliminary step assessment preventive analgesia woman 's post- op experience follow routine posterior vaginal wall surgery . Hypothesis : The addition PN ) , administer routine rectocele repair carry general anaesthetic ( GA ) , provide effective prolonged postoperative analgesia short hospital stay compare receive GA alone . Aim : To obtain preliminary data impact administer standard PNB routine rectocele repair woman 's post-op experience , assess feasibility future study potential procedure become routine part clinical practice . Objectives ass : feasibility recruitment retention , impact PNB woman 's post-op experience , obtain preliminary data inform sample size calculation refine outcome measure future study . Study design : This pilot/feasibility study undertaken within Gynaecology Department Royal Devon Exeter NHS Foundation Trust ( RD &amp; E NHS FT ) . Recruitment : It anticipate potential participant identify routine clinical care , clinician inform patient project general term seek permission contact detail pass research team . Potential participant contact member research team give detailed verbal write information . This follow opportunity discussion research team prior invite participate study . All potential participant fulfil entry criterion invite take part . This enable realistic assessment recruitment recruitment strategy . Procedure : Written inform consent obtain prior study procedure . This include permission access routinely collect data participant 's medical note . Baseline data include : height , weight , current medicine ( include routine analgesia ) . Participants randomise either intervention group ( General Anaesthetic ( GA ) PNB ) control group ( GA alone ) computer generate randomisation schedule . Surgical procedure : Participants undergo routine posterior vaginal wall surgery follow standard surgical procedure protocol . For randomised intervention group - standardise PNB administer prior completion surgery . Standardised PNB : A PNB perform injection local anaesthetic around trunk pudendal nerve , locate behind sacrospinous ligament . Using transvaginal approach , ischial spine palpate posterolateral vaginal sidewall . The sacrospinous ligament firm band run medially posteriorly ischial spine sacrum . The needle guide needle syringe contain anaesthetic insert tip lie vaginal mucosa 1 cm medial posterior ischial spine . When needle guide get properly position , needle push beyond tip vaginal mucosa sacrospinous ligament . After aspirate confirm absence intravascular location , 3 ml 0.25 % bupivacaine inject ligament . The needle advance slightly sensation resistance cause ligament lost . The needle lodge loose areolar tissue behind ligament pudendal nerve locate . Aspiration perform confirm absence intravascular position ( pudendal inferior gluteal vessel lie adjacent pudendal nerve ) , remain 7 mL anaesthetic inject . The procedure repeat contralateral side . Post -op : For participant investigator record : post -operative pain ( Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) score ) 6 , 12 , 24 , 36 48 hour , length bladder catheterisation , pain associate defecation analgesic consumption . Data Collection Recording : All participant assign unique study identifier ( ID ) All data collect record store ID number . Data initially record onto study specific data collection form ( DCF ) . Data record onto study specific database . Hard/scanned copy store study specific site file . To ensure data quality , data collect record screened review discrepancy miss data prior analysis . Confidentiality : data hold link-anonymised format , personal identifiable data accessible personnel train data protection . Participants ' research sample data identify unique study ID number data hold password-protected computer Data Storage Archiving : All consent paper data collection form scan onto disc store lock filing cabinet within CI 's controlled access office Centre Women 's Health duration project . Paper copy shred . At end project , study data archive per standard Research Development ( R &amp; D ) department protocol . Primary Outcome measure : Post- op pain score define VAS measure Secondary outcome measure : Length bladder catheterisation , pain associate defecation post-op analgesic consumption Statistics Power Calculations : The aim study obtain preliminary data determine feasibility future Randomised Control Trial ( RCT ) , determine clinical difference . The investigator estimate 40 potential participant available 9 month period ( figure obtain RD &amp; E Gynaecology Surgery dept . base last year 's operation list ) . The investigator invite patient fulfil entry criterion participate . This enable u determine realistic recruitment rate obtain estimate difference post-op pain score inform full RCT . Analysis restrict descriptive statistic . Adverse events/patient safety : It anticipate participant involve project subject adverse effect . Pudendal Nerve block rarely associate complication anaphylaxis , haematoma infection site injection , ischial paraesthesia systemic toxicity due intravascular administration . The risk rare complication would apply nerve block currently use routine clinical practice . The risk minimise procedure carry Gynaecological Consultant experience procedure , full anaesthetic surgical team back require . The CI inform adverse effect within 24 hour report follow local NHS R &amp; D protocols , copy adverse event form store project site file . Subjects inform free withdraw study time data cod anonymised . When data fully anonymised , participant still able withdraw data retain . During routine clinical care clinician involve study in-depth discussion woman care include treatment option potential complication associate surgery . Of particular concern patient much pain , leading initial idea use PNB relieve post-op pain . Resultant anecdotal feedback suggest result low post-op pain level patient ward similar operation . This lead directly development current project . The investigator subsequently discuss proposal cross section woman attend pre- post op Pelvic Organ Prolapse ( POP ) clinic . All express enthusiasm project willingness involve either participant user representative definitive study . Blinding : recruitment , member clinical surgical team ( member research team ) open next line randomisation envelope identify surgeon participant 's group allocation . This record participant 's unique study ID . Un-blinding : Should serious , adverse event clinical situation occur require participant un-blinded , decision make Chief Investigator ( CI ) report sponsor per standard R &amp; D Dept . Governance protocol ? Time scale : 12 month . In short term study provide preliminary data impact administer PNB woman undergo routine posterior vaginal wall surgery . In long term data inform future definitive study clinical economic impact routine use PNB context . Results write submitted publication peer-reviewed journal .</detailed_description>
