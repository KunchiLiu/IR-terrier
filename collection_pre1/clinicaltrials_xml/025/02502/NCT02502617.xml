	<brief_summary>In anorexia nervosa ( AN ) still remain clarified , psychiatric symptom direct consequence malnutrition adaptation starvation . There clinical consensus depression/anxiety cognitive impairment AN mainly sequelae malnutrition . However , consensus largely base experimental starvation study healthy subject back 1940s famine- food program third world , whereas evidence study AN lacking . The main objective study detail elucidate short-term change psychopathological profile , depression , anxiety , cognitive function relation intensive nutritional rehabilitation weight gain 10-30 % specialized medical stabilization unit . Secondarily , examine whether cortisol level associate depression/anxiety symptomatology cognitive impairment . The hypothesis improvement nutritional status short time lead clinically significant improvement psychopathology cognitive function , remain 2-3 month discharge , make patient accessible psychotherapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Anorexia nervosa ( AN ) syndrome characterize distorted body image morbid fear obesity . Restrictive eat compensatory behavior form excessive exercise vomit result malnutrition . Repeated revision diagnostic criterion recent decade definition result increase prevalence . The disease high mortality among psychiatric disorder . The majority death relate malnutrition consequence . There effective evidence-based treatment . At least 25 % remain chronically undernourished long course prolonged hospitalization psychiatric medical unit , social psychiatric institution - support , early retirement premature death . The etiology remain unknown unclear psychological symptom consequence malnutrition , one premorbid comorbid . Depression anxiety co-existing familiar feature patient AN occur degree term comorbidity . Antidepressant therapy show therapeutic effect AN . Varying degree cognitive impairment also well know feature AN , literature scanty investigate psychometric analyze . In early stage disease , starvation weight loss interpret cop strategy relief anxiety depressive symptom . If cop strategy work , effect may decrease line severity malnutrition . There almost clinical consensus depression / anxiety cognitive impairment AN sequela malnutrition . But , consensus rely mainly experimental study healthy subject back postwar year observation famine food program 3rd World . Knowledge relationship psychopathology malnutrition AN still limit small study contradictory conclusion . In recent study hospitalize patient , correlation body mass index ( BMI ) select psychometric variable could detect , essential limitation cross-sectional study population patient narrow BMI range . To knowledge , one longitudinal study change BMI depressive symptom publish . In study , mean weight gain significant predictor reduce score several `` specific '' eat disorder symptom , concern diet , weight gain predictor concern body depressive symptom . To knowledge , longitudinal re-nutrition study relationship weight gain anxiety cognitive function publish . A consequence starvation stress endocrine ax alter AN , lead protein- energy preserve adaptation . Thus , particular , increased level cortisol well describe AN patient primary affective disorder . Depression/anxiety cognitive impairment also well-described side effect pharmacological treatment corticosteroid well-known symptom excess endogenous cortisol production ( mb . Cushing ) . Moreover , neuroanatomical animal study indicate cortisol per se neurotoxic property may play pathogenic role affective disorder anxiety . There preliminary experimental evidence pharmacological cortisol synthesis inhibition may therapeutic efficacy depression . However , far investigate AN . In one study , find cortisol level correlate positively anxiety depression . Center Eating Disorders Odense University Hospital one three highly specialized national center Denmark . Within center , formalize collaboration psychiatric somatic unit . Patients life-threatening weight loss primarily hospitalize Nutrition section somatic stabilization weight gain typically , 10-40 % , either transfer psychiatric department discharge two-track psychiatric / somatic outpatient treatment . The Nutrition section receive severely ill patient nation . The median BMI 84 admission year 2013 13.8 ( range 7.8 - 25.8 ) . Internationally , somatic unit similar specialization patient volume , constitute basis study effect intensive re-nutrition per se . The center 's organization patient population describe several observational intervention study . International national guideline recommend treatment AN interdisciplinary double-track psychiatric - somatic . But , clear far fast nutritional rehabilitation may beneficial effect depression , anxiety cognitive impairment patient severe AN .</detailed_description>
