	<detailed_description>1 . INTRODUCTION 1.1 . BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE OF THE STUDY The long term prognosis patient suffer acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) progressively improve since introduction reperfusion therapy particular primary angioplasty [ 1 ] . In set ST-elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) , immediate reopen acutely occlude coronary artery via primary angioplasty treatment choice salvage ischemic myocardium . However , sudden re-initiation blood flow lead local acute inflammatory response endothelial myocardial damage . This phenomenon , describe 'reperfusion injury ' , may explain , despite optimum myocardial reperfusion , short-term mortality AMI approach 7 % [ 1 ] incidence heart failure approach 15-20 % [ 2 ] [ 3 ] . Despite use full conventional treatment , include ACE inhibitor , beta-blockers , aldosterone inhibitor diuretic , context randomise control trial yearly mortality rate patient post-infarction heart failure still range 10-13 % rehospitalisation worsen heart failure occur yearly rate 6-8 % [ 4 ] . Registry data indicate dismal outcome real world clinical experience . A major reason high morbidity mortality heart inadequate regenerative response myocardial necrosis sustain follow AMI ; cell death ischemic damage lead progressive ventricular dilation dysfunction process adverse leave ventricular remodelling . However , discovery tissue resident cardiac stem cell mammalian heart [ 5 ] challenge long hold belief heart terminally-differentiated organ open possibility use bone marrow derive stem cell repair heart . Indeed , recent experimental study document bone marrow-derived cell ( BMC ) injection infarcted heart stimulate formation newly form cardiac myocytes , although origin myocytes still matter debate [ 6 ] . Numerous pre-clinical study provide high degree evidence bone marrow derive cell contribute cardiac repair acute myocardial injury , limit infarct expansion improve cardiac function likely via paracrine mechanism action . Pre-clinical evidence corroborate several small intermediate size clinical trial demonstrate beneficial effect bone marrow derive cell top state-of-the-art reperfusion treatment [ 7 ] . For reason , European Community recently fund within FP-7 `` The effect intracoronary reinfusion bone marrow derive mononuclear cell ( BM-MNC ) cause-mortality acute myocardial infarction ( BAMI ) '' project aim definitively demonstrate efficacy BM-MNC patient myocardial infarction . Considering recovery post-infarction LV function favourably correlate bone marrow derive stem cell mobilization induce endogenous Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor ( G-CSF ) [ 8-9 ] , therapeutic stem cell mobilization propose alternative method ameliorate post-infarction LV function . Several basic study support notion suggest stem cell mobilization might improve LV function increase stem cell home damage myocardium addition favourable direct effect G-CSF LV myocardium [ 10-12 ] . On base several study evaluate effect G-CSF LV function patient myocardial result mixed result [ 13 ] . In general , G-CSF proven safe effect appear modest . However , patient large myocardial infarction effect significant clinically relevant approach 5 % increase LVEF . In particular Rigenera Trial conduct Catholic University Sacred Heart Rome 41 patient large anterior wall AMI high risk unfavorable remodel randomized 1:2 Lenograstim ( rhu G-CSF , Myelostim 34 , Italfarmaco ) ( 10 μg/kg/day 5 day ) conventional therapy . After median follow-up 5 month patient treat Lenograstim exhibit improvement 5 % LVEF , absence LV dilation . In contrast , patient treat conventionally exhibit significant LV dilation absence improvement LVEF [ 14 ] . In present study , subgroup 8 patient randomized Lenograstim receive also administration second-generation ultrasound contrast agent contain sulphur hexafluoride ( SonoVue® , Bracco , Milan , Italy ) administer intravenously ( 5 ml 1 ml/min ) myocardial opacification collect diagnostic image Myocardial Contrast Echocardiography . Interestingly , post hoc analysis , reveal patient receive Sonovue® show significant benefit LV function [ unpublished data ] . This could due increase home effect mobilize bone marrow derive stem cell due myocardial destruction contrast medium-microbubbles 3.5 MHz ultrasound produce Echo machine . As regard , two basic study demonstrate highly focused ultrasound-mediated stimulation microbubbles increase migration stem cell across myocardial endothelium post-ischemic myocardium vivo [ 15-16 ] . Moreover , long term ( 10 year ) follow data RIGENERA trial recently collect , confirm safety procedure significant improvement quality life assess NYHA functional class , Seattle Heart Failure Model , Minnesota Living Heart Failure Questionnaire ( p &lt; 0.005 ) compairing patient treat G-CSF versus standard therapy . Data regard efficacy , term LVEF , end-diastolic volume end-systolic volume currently analysis . On basis previous result , The Recupero dall'Infarto miocardico con G-CSF E Nuovi Esempi di Rigenerazione Avanzata ( RIGENERA 2.0 ) trial specifically test efficacy combine effect subcutaneous Granulocyte - Colony Stimulating Factor sulphur hexafluoride post-infarction leave ventricular function . 1.2 BENEFIT-RISK ASSESSMENT In every clinical trial , anticipate benefit need weigh study associate risk . In previous investigation G-CSF use , G-CSF associate adverse reaction report . Only MAGIC trial prematurely stop due possible safety concern treat patient term unexpectedly high restenosis rate stented vessel [ 17 ] . However , three patient G-CSF group receive angiographic follow-up , thus clear conclusion incidence restenosis reasonably draw study . In study use G-CSF adverse event comparable patient control [ 13 ] . Nevertheless G-CSF largely use oncology treatment febrile neutropenia hematology indication mobilization stem cell transplantation . As regard G-CSF consider reasonably safe without association document increase malignancy [ 18 ] . SonoVue show safe well tolerate minimal risk patient . In clinical trial , overall incidence adverse event relatively low ( 10.7 % overall , 5.2 % investigational product-related ) subject receive SonoVue . The frequently report adverse event headache ( 2.1 % ) , nausea ( 0.9 % ) , chest pain ( 0.8 % ) , chest discomfort ( 0.5 % ) . All adverse event occur frequency &lt; 0.5 % . Most adverse event mild resolve spontaneously within short time without sequela . Serious adverse event occur 0.43 % patient 0.08 % event consider relationship administration SonoVue ( probable , possible , unlikely ) . No product- related death report within MAH-sponsored trial . The anticipated benefit RIGENERA 2.0 trial study participant expect well LV function , parameter well-known influence long-term outcome . Nevertheless , chiefs different Units involve present study form Data Monitoring Committee stop study case observe increase rate adverse event . 2 . STUDY OBJECTIVES 2.1 .

OVERVIEW OF STUDY FLOW The RIGENERA 2.0 trial phase II placebo-controlled , randomize , open label , Blinded Evaluation end-points . One hundred twenty STEMI patient plan enrolled 4 Italian center ( Rome - Catholic University Sacred Heart , Ferrara , Pisa Padua ) . Patients acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction define universal definition AMI undergo acute revascularization ( i.e . either acute PCI within 24 hour symptom onset thrombolysis within 12 hour follow acute PCI within 24 hour symptom onset ) screen investigational site . Patients acute PCI institution different investigational site ( recruit center ) also include : interested patient may refer screen participate study site within 3 4 day . Informed consent assessment eligibility patient respect in- exclusion criterion do recruiting center . If eligibility criterion meet , echocardiography perform 3 6 day acute PCI ejection fraction quantify . In case LVEF≤45 % patient 1:1 electronically randomize G-CSF MCE placebo MCE accord site . Patients randomize receive either subcutaneous Granulocyte - Colony Stimulating Factor ( group 1 ) Placebo ( group 2 ) add top optimal standard care Myocardial Contrast Echocardiography intravenous infusion sulphur hexafluoride .
