	<detailed_description>In study , researcher evaluate intervention aim increase participation communication old adult primary care consultation General Practitioner ( GP ) . The researcher particularly interested Photo novel tool aim . Photo novels picture story , advantage use familiar narrative format , thereby possibly increase comprehension , personal involvement motivation self-efficacy perform relevant behavior offer role model ( story character similar old adult ) . The patient perspective doctor-patient communication underrepresented research . This study aim incorporate patient perspective different way : address need barrier focus group discussion , collect communication strategy solution barrier role play exercise , involve develop photo novel , study response photo novel evaluation study researcher describe research protocol . Aim intervention ( Photo novel ) : 1. increase old adult ' awareness need barrier conversation GP ; 2. improve old adult ' access information enable ask different question GP ; 3. increase old adult ' problem solve ability conversation GP ensure good self-management health issue . 4. find format efficacious This could include honest limited understanding , ask information enable improve share decision make consultation enable improve self-management consultation . This could also include filter information enable patient determine relevance information . Furthermore , could include strategy translate advice concrete action , e.g . transform 'knowing ' 'knowing ' ( I know / understand I use less salt but… How to… decrease salt-intake daily life ? ) In photo novel , researcher provide old adult 'template communicative behavior ' embedded picture story use primary care consultation GP . Relevant communicative behavior include 'asking question ' , 'expressing lack misunderstand ' , 'expressing uncertainty ' , 'expressing preference need ' relevant communicative behavior identify focus group discussion older adult informal care giver . These relevant communicative behavior embed within different relevant domain , base communication theory / literature output focus group discussion . The seven scenario link endpoint medical communication framework develop Haes Bensing . The researcher propose evaluate effectiveness photo novel use Experimental Design , include quantitative qualitative measurement . This combination measurement provide u insight regard three important Research Questions : 1 . To extent photo novel effective tool / intervention empower old adult conversation GP compare traditional brochure contain tip GP-patient communication ? 2 . Which elements domain include photo novel effective ? 3 . Which narrative / theoretical mechanism account effectiveness photo novel ? The researcher recruit old adult participant ( &gt; 50 year ) , live area indicative limited marginal health literacy . The researcher perform follow procedure recruitment . The researcher recommend build relationship GP practice , healthcare organization community organization ask cooperation pre-established period time . The researcher pay careful attention part study , e.g . carefully design recruitment wording : 'We conduct study improve relationship/ conversation GP , way make sure health care receive improve . We invite participate study . Would like participate ? ' Participants ask come neutral setting , example within University , visit community building , take part study . Based consent participate , schedule develop eligible patient . Participants randomize one two condition present photo novel traditional brochure either present hard copy brochure pdf tablet computer ( 2x2 factorial design ) accompany questionnaire . The researcher aim participant different age .</detailed_description>
