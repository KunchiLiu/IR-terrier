	<brief_summary>The primary purpose study evaluate whether type fluid ( 0.9 % saline 6 % Hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 ) context individualize goal-directed fluid therapy associate difference morbidity mortality within first 14 day patient moderate-to-high risk postoperative complication abdominal surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fluid Loading Abdominal Surgery : Saline Versus Hydroxyethyl Starch ( FLASH Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fluid administration mainstay treatment suspect hypovolemia surgery , effect different crystalloid colloid solution outcome remain poorly explored surgical patient . Two recent international multicenter study ( 6S CHEST study ) show , compare crystalloid solution , use hydroxyethyl starch ( HES ) could responsible high morbidity , especially renal failure , mortality ICU patient , thus lead recent restriction range indication . In contrast , surgical patient , recent meta-analyses conclude absence difference term mortality postoperative renal failure crystalloids late generation HES . Excessive fluid administration surgery associate increase risk postoperative morbidity , include renal dysfunction mortality . It suggest , compare volume-restoring effect colloid , crystalloid use may require administration high fluid volume , may contribute poor outcome . In surgical context , clinical trial meta-analyses show individualized goal-direct fluid administration reduce postoperative morbidity . Although GDT study use colloid solution fluid load , effect type fluid currently unknown crystalloids propose first-line therapy . The propose Flash multicenter study conduct assess use HES crystalloid solution individualize GDT contribute outcome difference patient moderate-to-high risk postoperative complication abdominal surgery . As fluid widely use surgery current concern risk relate use HES-based product ICU patient , trial provide important data clinician involve perioperative care .</detailed_description>
