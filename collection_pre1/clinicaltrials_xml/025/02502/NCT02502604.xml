	<brief_summary>Individuals affective disorder ( include post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) major depressive disorder ( MDD ) ) often experience decline cognitive ability memory attention . Such difficulty reduce function important aspect life , include work school . Little research conduct investigate cognitive dysfunction reduce individual PTSD MDD follow specific treatment . Thus , investigator plan determine utility cognitive training program call goal management training ( GMT ) reduce cognitive dysfunction MDD/PTSD . GMT aim assist participant build skill perform specific behaviour rely basic cognitive process , allow achieve identify goal . 64 individual PTSD 64 MDD divide two group 32 , one GMT group , one wait-list group receive GMT study completion . The investigator predict comparison wait-list group , GMT group show great improvement cognitive function everyday function follow treatment improvement remain long-term .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In addition core affective component , MDD PTSD associate poor cognitive functioning across host highly similar domain , include declarative memory , short-term memory , attention , executive functioning . These deficit associate reduced response pharmacological non-pharmacological intervention poor functional outcome . Given potentially devastating impact poor cognitive functioning ability patient affective disorder benefit treatment intervention , association poor functional outcome , urgent need identify novel treatment intervention aim reduce cognitive dysfunction disorder . Accordingly , aim present proposal randomize control trial examine efficacy well-established cognitive intervention aim reduce attentional executive dysfunction , Goal Management TrainingÂ® ( GMT ) , treatment cognitive deficit among patient MDD PTSD . A secondary aim determine longer-term impact approach functional outcome . Importantly , limited investigation cognitive remediation therapy perform population . Only one study conduct examine impact non-standardized intervention protocol aim improve cognitive functioning PTSD . Here , clinically ( statistically ) significant improvement note small pilot study measure cognitive function employ bottom-up executive training approach conjunction transcranial direct current sample four patient . Previously , investigator apply computer-assisted cognitive remediation , bottom-up restitution base approach , patient MDD , result improvement performance work memory task conjunction increase functional activity lateral prefrontal parietal area , however , broad benefit train observe small sample ( n=12 ) generalize large group . GMT demonstrate efficacy several clinical non-clinical population experience deficit executive functioning , attention , memory ( similar see MDD PTSD ) , include old adult , individual suffer traumatic brain injury , ADHD , poly-substance abuse disorder , spina bifida . In study , participant show improvement complete every-day task ( measure self-report ) , well improvement executive function decision-making , work memory selective attention . Critically , result maintain follow-up ( assess ) . Given previous success intervention remediate frontal-temporally mediate brain dysfunction across clinical population , investigator hypothesize GMT ability target similar cognitive difficulty experience suffer MDD PTSD . The investigator examine whether putative improvement cognitive performance translate functional improvement analogous see psychiatric population undergo cognitive remediation . In current study , investigator conduct first study investigate utility GMT patient MDD PTSD . Specifically , primary aim propose study examine whether standardized 9-week program GMT result durable improvement cognitive function relative wait-list control ( WLC ) . A secondary aim determine whether participation GMT group associate long-term functional improvement . The investigator hypothesize post-treatment , participant MDD PTSD assign GMT group show significantly great improvement neuropsychological test performance great functional improvement compare participant WLC group ; gain expect maintain 3 month follow-up .</detailed_description>
