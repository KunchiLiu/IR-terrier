	<brief_title>Effect Urinary Alkalinization Urine Uric Acid Precipitation Crystallization Adults With Type 1 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetic nephropathy characterize glomerular disease also tubulointerstitial injury . The tubular change associate diabetic nephropathy , include basement membrane thickening , tubular hypertrophy , epithelial-mesenchymal transition , glycogen accumulation interstitial inflammation . Although glomerular change receive significantly attention researcher clinicians tubulointerstitial change diabetes , tubular injury know associate well renal function glomerular injury . In fact , tubular proteinuria may precede microalbuminuria type 1 diabetes , suggest tubular damage may induce early glomerular injury course diabetic nephropathy . Serum uric acid ( SUA ) low adolescent adult type 1 diabetes compare non-diabetic peer . Despite low level SUA remain important risk factor diabetic nephropathy type 1 diabetes , large clinical trial underway examine ability allopurinol prevent early renal loss . Several mechanism propose explain low level SUA type 1 diabetes include glucosuria induce uricosuria lead spill urine uric acid ( UUA ) lower SUA , notion intracellular uric acid ( IUA ) and/ UUA rather SUA may responsible development complication . Animal study demonstrate block uric acid production protect kidney tubulointerstitial injury , suggest causal role uric acid development diabetic tubular injury . Relative dehydration , secondary glucosuria , exercise inadequate liquid intake , may lead concentrated acidic urine , may cause UUA precipitate crystallize type 1 diabetes . The UUA precipitation crystallization think induce inflammation injury tubule possible retrograde glomerular injury . Moreover , recently show UUA promote apoptosis human proximal tubular cell oxidative stress activation NADPH Oxidase NOX 4 . Oral alkali replacement readily available , safe include follow formulation sodium bicarbonate , BiCitra ( sodium citrate citric acid ) , PolyCitra ( citric acid , sodium citrate , potassium citrate ) , polycitra-K ( potassium citrate citric acid ) . In contrast sodium bicarbonate , citrate convert bicarbonate liver thus conversion affect liver disease . Usual adult dos urinary alkalinization 325 2000 mg orally 1 4 time day . One gram provide 12 mEq ( mmoL ) sodium bicarbonate , titrate goal urine pH 8.0 . In prospective open-label trial 4 g sodium bicarbonate administer orally 3 time daily 9 healthy volunteer 24 hour , 10 hour participant urine pH ≥ 7 20 hour participant urine pH ≥ 8 . No adverse effect abnormal blood result document 24-hour follow-up . Urinary alkalinization solubilize UUA thereby increase concentration uric acid urine decrease precipitation crystallization UUA . It unknown whether alkalinization urine reduces UUA precipitation crystallization type 1 diabetes . With diabetic nephropathy lead cause end-stage renal disease Western world , critical develop well understanding determinant risk progression early diabetic nephropathy , improve outcome patient type 1 diabetes . UUA particularly attractive therapeutic target due potential reduce tubular injury sodium bicarbonate . Accordingly , investigator propose pilot experimental study examine effect urine alkalinization oral sodium bicarbonate UUA precipitation crystallization adult type 1 diabetes .</detailed_description>
