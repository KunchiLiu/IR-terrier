	<brief_summary>- Number dose interval : Two dos , 2 week apart - Method administration : Oral administration - Volume vaccine administer : 1.5 mL/dose - Observational period : 4 week ( 2 week dose ) - Number visit : 3 visit 1 . Visit 1 : Screening enrollment ( 1st dose ) 2 . Visit 2 : 2nd dose 2 week 1st dose ( 14+3 day ) 3 . Visit 3 : 2 week 2nd dose ( 28+3 day ) , end subject participation . This study carry healthy adult child , two site , enrollment competitive site . Subjects stratify accord age adult ( 18~40 year age ) child ( 1~17 year age ) . According pre-generated randomization list , participant randomize test comparator group ( Visit 1 ) give either test vaccine comparator vaccine . For immunogenicity assessment , blood sample take Visit 1 ( prior vaccination ) , Visit 2 ( prior vaccination ) , end-of-study Visit ( Visit 3 ) . For Safety assessment : participant observe 30 minute post vaccination instruct record solicit adverse event occur 6 day vaccination participant diary card . This study observer-blind : vaccine administrator vaccine safety evaluator two distinct person avoid bias safety assessment . Trial staff vaccine administrator remain blinded handle investigational product .</brief_summary>
