	<brief_summary>Pelvic organ prolapse ( POP ) common condition woman . Approximately 20 % woman undergo surgical correction POP lifetime . Overactive bladder symptom ( OAB ) often associate POP 25-69 % patient POP show independent risk factor OAB . There scientific evidence surgical repair POP reduce eliminate OAB &gt; 85 % . In addition , stress urinary incontinence ( SUI ) also often associate POP , either clinically evident potential post-operative complication . The clinical decision include surgical technique treat SUI repair POP surgically still matter controversy . Most surgeon institution include extra procedure , specifically retropubic sling , SUI clinically evident . Some include unless urodynamic clinical evidence potential SUI post-operatively . Finally , include regardless clinical urodynamic finding base apparent high incidence SUI prolapse repair . The Tension-Free-Vaginal Tape ( TVT ) observe reduce OAB well produce de-novo OAB symptom , effect TVT OAB still unclear . The purpose study determine effect additional TVT surgery OAB symptoms patient undergoing POP repair . It hop data well determine effect either surgical intervention strategy OAB symptom . This prospective cohort study compare patient OAB undergo surgical repair prolapse without additional TVT surgery . The outcome measure use pre- post-operative validated questionnaire ( PFDI-20 , OAB-q short form ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Additional Stress Incontinence Procedure Overactive Bladder During Pelvic Organ Prolapse Repair</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis : Based limited data available , investigator expect find less improvement OAB symptom woman undergo POP surgery TVT undergo POP surgery alone . Primary Aim : To determine effect addition TVT OAB symptom woman undergo surgical repair pelvic organ prolapse use validated questionnaire . Secondary Aims : To compare postoperative complication undergo prolapse surgery alone undergo prolapse surgery TVT . Lastly investigator would like evaluate comorbidities potential association degree OAB symptom Methods : Potential eligible subject recruit use information provide urogynecology staff review upcoming OR schedule . After subject identify , surgeon contact confirm whether patient contact research team . Only permission communicate surgeon research team team approach patient potential participation . After patient consent participate ask fill PFDI-20 questionnaire . This validated questionnaire divide 3 section relate prolapse symptom , bowel symptom urinary symptom , respectively . It base 5 point scale- 0 , term bothersome symptom 2- , 3- somewhat , 4- moderately , 5- quite bit . A high score indicate great degree bother . Focus UDI-6 section , pertain urinary symptom . The question determine inclusion exclusion patient question 15 16 : `` Do usually experience frequent urination '' `` Do usually experience urine leakage associate feeling urgency ; , strong sensation need go bathroom ? '' Those respond negatively question exclude respond affirmatively question include . The patient OAB symptom ask fill OAB-q short form validate questionnaire include 6-item symptom bother scale ( OAB-q s ) 13-item HRQL scale ( OAB-q HRQL ) . This complete pre-operatively 6 week , 6 month 12 month post-operatively . Interventions : No intervention make . This observational study . Outcomes Primary : The primary outcome measure use pre- post-operative validated questionnaire ( PFDI-20 , OAB-q short form ) . The primary study endpoint Overactive Bladder Questionnaire Symptom Severity ( OAB-q s ) change score 6 week surgery . The change score score pre-operatively minus score post-operatively . A positive score indicate less symptom severity surgery . The investigator define significant improvement change score OAB-q ssâ‰¥10 base previous work determine minimally important difference OAB-q s 10 high . Secondary : The secondary study endpoint OAB-q HRQL change score UDI-6 change score calculate use method .</detailed_description>
