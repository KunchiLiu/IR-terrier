	<brief_summary>Mild Cognitive Impairment ( MCI ) represent group person risk incident dementia near-term . Persons MCI deficits short-term recall ( amnestic MCI ) significant risk incident Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) ( term prodromal AD ) , thus represent worthy target secondary prevention intervention . There increase evidence risk factor metabolic syndrome ( prediabetes type 2 diabetes ) increase risk incident cognitive impairment possibly AD , evidence neuron AD brain fact insulin resistant diminish glucose uptake physiological condition . Thus , person MCI prediabetes type 2 diabetes may particular risk incident cognitive impairment AD . A large clinical trial ( ACCORD ) 1 demonstrated tight control peripheral blood glucose improve cognitive ( health ) outcomes old person peripheral insulin resistance . Thus , need target cognitive outcome person MCI metabolic risk factor , drug target insulin resistance good blood-brain-barrier ( BBB ) penetrance potentially accomplish objective . While phase III study intranasal insulin target strategy , nutraceuticals offer low-tech solution would suitable future secondary prevention trial MCI . Bioactive Dietary Polyphenol Preparation ( BDPP ) combination two nutraceutical preparation grape seed polyphenolic extract ( GSE ) , resveratrol contain abundant concentration polyphenols . The investigator find oral BDPP administration associate improved cognition brain plasticity long-term potentiation ( LTP ) mouse model metabolic syndrome AD , well lower brain amyloid tau burden AD mouse model2-4 . The investigator demonstrate excellent absorption oral BDPP small study human similarly excellent CSF penetration oral BDPP rat , crucial demonstrate safety CSF penetration oral BDPP human assess potential treatment MCI prediabetes type 2 diabetes .</brief_summary>
