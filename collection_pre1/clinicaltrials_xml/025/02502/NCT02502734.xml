	<brief_summary>This study conduct evaluate effect daily treatment fluticasone furoate ( FF ) low leg growth pediatric subject persistent asthma use knemometry . Approximately 65 paediatric asthmatic subject , age 5 11 year ( inclusive ) , screen achieve 60 randomise 50 evaluable subject . Subjects meet eligibility criterion enter 2 week run-in period . After complete run-in period , subject randomly allocate one two treatment sequence : inhale fluticasone furoate follow placebo placebo follow inhaled fluticasone furoate . Each treatment administer via ELLIPTA™ dry powder inhaler . The two treatment period separate two-week wash-out period . Subjects complete two treatment period enter 7 day follow-up period . ARNUITY™ ELLIPTA ( FF ) approve US adult adolescent age 12 . ARNUITY ELLIPTA register trademark GlaxoSmithKline group company .</brief_summary>
