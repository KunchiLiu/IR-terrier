	<brief_summary>Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) common disorder characterize recurrent collapse upper airway sleep . OSA patient small upper airway keep patent wakefulness compensatory increase upper airway ( UA ) dilator muscle ( e.g . genioglossus ) activity . At sleep onset compensation reduce lose , result upper airway narrow collapse . Previous study upper airway muscle training show variable result OSA , far practical , long-term , systematic upper airway muscle training develop study treatment OSA . In theory , strengthen upper airway muscle exercise training theory help maintain patent airway sleep . Therefore , investigator aim test hypothesis : 1 ) UA muscle train improve sleep apnea patient OSA , include already receive treatment PAP oral appliance therapy . 2 ) Muscle train viable therapy definable subset OSA patient . Investigators hypothesize patient OSA mild moderately compromise upper airway anatomy benefit . 3 ) There positive association change muscle function improvement OSA severity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) common disorder characterize recurrent collapse upper airway sleep , lead recurrent arousal subsequent daytime sleepiness . The commonly accepted reason initiation obstructive respiratory event OSA patient small upper airway keep patent wakefulness compensatory increase upper airway dilator muscle ( e.g . genioglossus ) activity . At sleep onset compensation reduce lose , result upper airway narrow collapse . Upper airway ( UA ) muscle training appear benefit OSA improvement AHI , although current data show variable result , particularly publication bias take account . Many remain skeptical data base clinical experience prior negative study ( remain largely unpublished ) . Moreover , previous positive study involve exercise usually impractical continue long-term . Therefore , investigator undertake rigorous assessment practical UA muscle training OSA . Investigators recruit patient OSA wither unable/unwilling use CPAP , well already treatment PAP oral appliance . The exercise include 4 step : step 1 put individualize fitted oral retainer device guide exercise ; step 2 push tongue towards hard palate press movable part oral retainer device 4 minute ; step 3 touch hard palate use middle part tongue , hold 10 second repeat 4 minute ; step 4 remove retainer device brush tongue gently side 2 minute . The exercise take 20 minute day ( 10 minute morning 10 minute afternoon/evening ) . Investigators study effect upper airway ( UA ) muscle train OSA severity , muscle strengh endurance . Investigators aim determine characteristic OSA patient likely benefit UA muscle train association change muscle function OSA severity .</detailed_description>
