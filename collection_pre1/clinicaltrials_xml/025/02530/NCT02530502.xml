	<brief_summary>The purpose phase I trial determine safest , effective dose MK-3475 ( pembrolizumab ) , use radiotherapy temozolomide treat newly diagnose patient glioblastoma ( GBM ) . Phase II trial evaluate MK-3475 use combination temozolomide radiation follow radiation temozolomide see good use radiation temozolomide alone . Temozolomide bind deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) , change , trigger death tumor cell . MK-3475 investigational drug , currently approve Federal Drug Administration ( FDA ) use treat GBM approve treat melanoma . MK-3475 work target local tumor immune-protection solid tumor . It hop addition MK-3475 usual treatment GBM improve current treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy With Temozolomide Pembrolizumab Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) radiation therapy ( RT ) + temozolomide ( TMZ ) + MK-3475 ( pembrolizumab ) follow MK-3475 + TMZ x 6 cycle ( 1 cycle 9 week ) , MK-3475 continue additional 12 month . ( Phase I ) II . To determine progression-free survival ( PFS ) newly diagnose glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) patient treat RT + TMZ + MK-3475 follow MK-3475 + TMZ x 6 cycle ( 1 cycle 9 week ) , MK-3475 continue additional 12 month . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine PFS-6 ( percentage patient alive progression-free 6 month post registration ) ; response rate ; overall survival ( OS ) ; OS-6 , 12 24 ( percentage patient alive 6 , 12 24 month respectively ) ; safety MK-3475 GBM . ( Phase II ) TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine correlation program cell death 1 ( PD1 ) program cell death 1 ligand 1 ( PDL1 ) expression T-cell infiltrate pathology first , applicable , second surgical specimen outcome . ( Phase I/II ) II . Assess change peripheral T-cell activation tryptophan metabolite . ( Phase I/II ) III . Correlate o-6-methylguanine-deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) methyltransferase ( MGMT ) status outcome . ( Phase I/II ) OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study pembrolizumab , follow phase II study . RT PORTION : Patients undergo focal RT 42 day , receive concurrent temozolomide orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-42 pembrolizumab IV 30 minute day 1 , 22 , 43 . POST-RT : After completion RT , patient receive temozolomide PO QD day 1-5 29-34 course 1 day 1-5 29-33 subsequent course , pembrolizumab IV 30 minute day 1 , 22 , 43 . Treatment repeat every 9 week 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After 6 course , patient derive benefit may continue receive pembrolizumab additional 12 month . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 2-4 month .</detailed_description>
