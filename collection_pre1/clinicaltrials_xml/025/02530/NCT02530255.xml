	<brief_summary>A method detect amyloid retina develop . A specially design retinal camera directly visualze record retinal amyloid via image processing generate number : retinal amyloid index ( RAI ) . The amount retinal amyloid correlate cerebral amyloid predictive value Alzheimer 's disease . Telomere attrition account cellular age felt pivotal role Alzheimer 's disease . The investigator plan screen individual select retinal amyloid evaluate oral telomerase activator determine use alter RAI time compare placebo .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Telomerase Activation - Retinal Amyloid Study Telomere attrition link neurodegenerative disease Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . AD definitively diagnose autopsy fact prompt exhaustive investigation look reliable biomarkers AD . It known clinical sign AD end result year accumulation aggregate protein substance , amyloid . The retina part brain recently , diagnostic technology develop allows detection retinal amyloid . Tissue study show correlation retinal cerebral amyloid , propose early detection retinal amyloid , long clinical dementia , may offer opportunity intervention slow halt progressive amyloid deposition . Special image technology develop capable detect retinal amyloid via adapted retinal camera . Neurovision Imaging ( NVI ) company develop test technology : retinal amyloid detection measurement . A study propose investigate measurable treatment effect telomerase activator TA-65 retinal amyloid participant . It anticipate recruit primarily direct adult child individual clinical AD . The study include 50 participant term 12 month ; anticipate 300 individual screen acquire participant . The study conduct single site : Chippewa Valley Eye Clinic , Eau Claire , Wisconsin and/or satellite . TA-Sciences sponsor study , provide telomere length test saliva sample collect start conclusion study . TA-Sciences also provide active placebo product term study .</detailed_description>
