	<brief_title>Mesenchymal Stem Cells ( MSC ) Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>MSCs type stem cell remove bone marrow sample grow many different cell type use treat cancer . The MSCs use study collect healthy male donor store laboratory MD Anderson . The use male cell help u detect cell infuse versus female cell . The MSCs genetically change laboratory MD Anderson add protein call interferon . The MSCs genetic material introduce molecule call plasmid help produce interferon beta . Interferons ( IFNs ) proteins may interfere growth tumor . The MSCs grown laboratory test give . MSC-INFβ Dose Levels : If find eligible take part study , assign dose level MSC-INFβ base join study . Up 4 dose level MSC-INFβ test . Up 3 participant enrol dose level . The first group participant receive low dose level . Each new group receive high dose group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose MSC-INFβ found . Your dose level may lower tolerate MSC-INFβ infusion . Your study doctor discus . MSC-INFβ Administration : About 1-2 week first MSC-INFβ infusion , intraperitoneal ( IP ) catheter place abdomen . A catheter sterile flexible tube place abdomen local anesthesia . Your doctor explain procedure detail , receive Patient Information Sheet include definition intraperitoneal therapy information placement catheter care catheter study . You also provide specific separate inform consent IP catheter placement Interventional Radiology staff MD Anderson . One time week 4 week ( 4 time total ) , receive MSC-INFβ infusion IP catheter . The length time infusion depend size tumor . You remain clinic 30 minute observation MSC-INFβ infusion . Study Tests : About 1 week first MSC-INFβ infusion : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign ( blood pressure , heart rate , temperature , breathe rate ) . - Your medical history record . - Blood ( 4 tablespoon time ) drawn routine test , check kidney liver function , check status disease , INFβ test comparison purpose . Blood test may repeat frequently study doctor think need . - You complete symptom questionnaire . It take 10-15 minute complete . About 1-2 week first MSC-INFβ infusion , procedure IP catheter placement , tumor biopsy check status disease . To collect tumor biopsy , affect area numb anesthetic small amount tissue withdrawn large needle . A day two tumor biopsy , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn test clot factor blood . Once week 4 week , MSC-INFβ infusion : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Blood ( 4 tablespoon time ) drawn routine test , check kidney liver function , check status disease response infusion . ° Blood test may repeat frequently study doctor think need . - If become pregnant , blood urine pregnancy test . If blood , include routine blood draw list . - Before 1st , 2nd , 3rd MSC-INFβ infusion , complete symptom questionnaire . It take 10-15 minute time complete . - Before MSC-INFβ infusion , 2 teaspoon peritoneal fluid ( present ) drawn catheter store laboratory MD Anderson future research relate study . Before peritoneal fluid use research , researcher must get approval Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) MD Anderson . The IRB committee doctor , researcher , community member . The IRB responsible protect study participant make sure research safe ethical . Your sample give code number . No identify information directly link sample . Only researcher charge bank access code number able link sample . This allow medical data relate sample update need . After last MSC-INFβ infusion : - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn test clot factor blood . - You tumor biopsy IP catheter remove . The tumor biopsy test determine MSC-INFβ infusion effect tumor . Follow-Up Visits : About 1 week last MSC-INFβ infusion : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Blood ( 4 tablespoon ) draw 1 week last MSC-INFβ infusion routine test , check kidney liver function , check status disease response infusion . If doctor think need , blood ( 2 tablespoon time ) draw 44 day last MSC-INFβ infusion month 2 month check response infusion . - You complete symptom questionnaire . It take 10-15 minute complete . About 4-6 week last MSC-INFβ infusion , CT scan chest , abdomen , pelvis check status disease . This may repeat every 2 month 12 month start 4-6 week last MSC-INFβ infusion , doctor think need . Length Study : You take study disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , study doctor think best interest . Long-Term Follow-Up : For safety reason , U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) require patient receive infusion stem cell treat gene transfer procedure must follow long-term follow-up least 15 year receive gene transfer . Once year Years 1-5 last MSC-INFβ infusion : - Blood ( 2-4 tablespoon time ) drawn routine test . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - You complete questionnaire ask medical history ( general health , status medical condition , illness hospitalization may occur ) . It take 15-30 minute complete . - You ask change contact information . - If necessary check status disease , compute tomography ( CT ) scan and/or additional routine blood test ( 1-2 tablespoon ) . Once year Years 6-15 last MSC-INFβ infusion , research staff contact . Either phone , email , mail , fill questionnaire ask medical history ( general health , status medical condition , illness hospitalization may occur ) . The phone call questionnaire take 15-30 minute time . This investigational study . MSC-INFβ infusion ovarian cancer investigational . Up 21 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
