	<detailed_description>Hoarseness one common present complaint otolaryngology . The differential diagnosis hoarseness board , large percentage attribute laryngopharyngeal reflux ( LPR ) . LPR refers symptomatic effect regurgitate gastric content pharynx larynx.1-3 1,2 Although dual-probe 24 hour pH monitoring gold standard diagnosis LPR , always perform due inconvenience cost . Patients commonly treat base history physical examination finding alone . The literature efficacy anti-reflux therapy LPR controversial . Karkos et al perform systematic review use empiric treatment proton pump inhibitor ( PPI ) patient suspect LPR find statistically significant difference patient treat PPI treat placebo reference symptom severity frequency presume reflux event . 2 Commonly patient start empiric therapy anti-reflux medication lifestyle modification . Laryngoscopy perform patient present dysphonia . While variety finding characterize consistent reflux study perform Hicks et al , find 86 % normal volunteer finding consistent reflux flexible laryngoscopy.5 This call question sensitivity specificity laryngoscopy diagnosis LPR . Park et al perform study compare effectiveness anti-reflux therapy alone versus combination voice therapy PPI treatment presume LPR-related dysphonia , find combination therapy superior anti-reflux therapy alone . 3 Because study compare voice therapy directly anti-reflux therapy , one determine whether improvement due augmentation anti-reflux therapy voice therapy , voice therapy alone superior treatment LPR-related dysphonia . There currently study compare effectiveness voice therapy alone , anti-reflux therapy alone , combination therapy . Patients present dysphonia may treat anti-reflux medication . These medication without side effect . It hypothesize subset patient think reflux relate dysphonia misuse voice successfully treated voice therapy alone . This study prospective , randomize , unblinded control trial . Patients present Otolaryngology clinic diagnose LPR-related dysphonia meet inclusion criterion eligible enroll study randomize one three treatment arm . Reflux symptom index ( RSI ) score , reflux find score ( RFS ) , voice handicap index-10 ( VHI-10 ) score , consensus auditory perceptual evaluation-voice ( CAPE-V ) score compare prior initiation therapy well 1 , 2 , 3 month follow initiation treatment .</detailed_description>
