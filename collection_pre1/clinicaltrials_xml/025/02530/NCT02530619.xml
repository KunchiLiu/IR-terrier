	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety alisertib effect , bad and/or good , acute megakaryoblastic leukemia ( AMKL ) myelofibrosis ( MF ) . The study drug , alisertib , investigational drug . An investigational drug one approve U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . Alisertib show evidence lab may effect type cell produce platelet . This cell call megakaryocyte know defective ( n't work well ) AMKL MF .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Alisertib Treating Patients With Myelofibrosis Relapsed Refractory Acute Megakaryoblastic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine safety profile alisertib patient acute megakaryoblastic leukemia ( AMKL ) patient myelofibrosis ( MF ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine preliminary efficacy alisertib population . TERCIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Describe pharmacodynamics ( PD ) effect alisertib peripheral blood and/or bone marrow sample . II . Evaluate relationship biomarker expression level response alisertib . III . Evaluate reduction splenomegaly palpation ( MF arm ) . IV . Evaluate improvement MF symptom ( MF arm ) , assess Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment form ( MPN-SAF ) . V. Assess change bone marrow fibrosis patient MF arm . OUTLINE : Patients receive alisertib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-7 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow approximately 30 day 6 month .</detailed_description>
