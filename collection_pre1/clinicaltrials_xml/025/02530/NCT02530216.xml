AEGIS utilizes computerize adaptive testing ( CAT ) guide patient question draw library 300 symptom attribute measure timing , severity , frequency , location , quality , character GI symptom , along relevant comorbidities , family history , alarm feature .

In cross-sectional study American Journal Gastroenterology compare AEGIS versus physician-documented HPIs , investigator find blind physician reviewer perceive AEGIS HPIs high overall quality , good organize , succinct , comprehensible , complete useful compare HPIs write physicians usual care academic GI clinic . In current study , investigator aim evaluate computer-generated HPIs prospectively wider scale diverse academic community-based setting . Moreover , investigator aim test enhance AEGIS intervention tie patient HPIs individualize `` education prescription '' guide patient library multi-media educational material GI symptom , condition , treatment .</brief_summary>
