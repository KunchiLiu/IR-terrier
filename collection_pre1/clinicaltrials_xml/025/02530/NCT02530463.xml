	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn nivolumab and/or ipilimumab , without azacitidine , safe give patient MDS . Researchers also want learn study drug combination help control disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nivolumab Ipilimumab With 5-azacitidine Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndromes ( MDS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign 1 6 study cohort , base join study treatment already receive . Participants already receive treatment call hypomethylating agent Cohorts 1-3 . Participants receive treatment Cohorts 4-6 : - If Cohort 1 , receive nivolumab . - If Cohort 2 , receive ipilimumab . - If Cohort 3 , receive nivolumab ipilimumab . - If Cohort 4 , receive azacitidine nivolumab . - If Cohort 5 , receive azacitidine ipilimumab . - If Cohort 6 , receive azacitidine , nivolumab , ipilimumab . Study Drug Administration : Study cycle Cohorts 1-3 3-4 week long . Study cycle Cohorts 4-6 4 week long . If receive nivolumab , receive vein 1 hour Days 1 15 . If receive ipilimumab , receive vein 90 minute Day 1 6 cycle . If receive azacitidine , receive vein 10-40 minute 5 day every 4 week , receive drug ( ) describe Days 6 and/or 20 cycle . If Cohorts 1-3 doctor think best interest , may begin receive azacitidine Cycle 6 . Study Visits : One ( 1 ) time week Cycle 1 , one time every cycle : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . These test may do often doctor think need . If doctor think need , Day 21 28 Cycles 1 ( depend cohort assign ) every 3 month , bone marrow aspiration check status disease cytogenetic testing . If become pregnant , urine blood ( 1 teaspoon ) pregnancy test every 6 week . Length Treatment : You may continue take study drug ( ) long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug ( ) disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study follow-up visit . Follow-up visit : If become pregnant , urine blood ( 1 teaspoon ) pregnancy test 30 70 day stop take study drug . There additional laboratory research study may eligible may help researcher learn disease . You give separate consent form study explain goal risk . This investigational study . Nivolumab ipilimumab FDA approve commercially available treatment MDS . Nivolumab ipilimumab approve treatment melanoma . Their use MDS investigational . Azacitidine approve FDA treatment MDS . The use drug combination investigational . Up 120 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
