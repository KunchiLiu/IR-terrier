	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : Each study cycle 21 day . You receive study drug 2 set 4 cycle ( 4 cycle surgery 4 cycle surgery ) . On Day 1 Cycle 1 , receive atezolizumab vein 60 minute . On Day 1 later cycle surgery , tolerate first infusion , receive future infusion atezolizumab vein 30 minute . You receive nab-paclitaxel vein 30 minute Days 1 , 8 , 15 Cycles 1-4 surgery . If side effect , study doctor may decide low dose study drug stop take drug . You may able restart study drug later low dose . The study doctor discus . Study Visits : On Day 1 cycle : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - During Cycle 3 , ultrasound breast ( ) surgery . Additional imaging may do part routine care , doctor think need . - During Cycle 3 , blood ( 1 tablespoon time ) drawn surgery time surgery . On Days 8 &amp; 15 Cycles 1-4 , blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine testing . Within 6 week receive 4 cycle study drug , surgery part standard care part tumor tissue remove surgery collect biomarker test . You give surgery consent form describe procedure risk . On Day 21 Cycle 8 , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine biomarker test . Length Treatment : You may receive study drug 4 cycle surgery 4 cycle surgery ( 8 cycle total ) . You longer able take study drug , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . You may able continue take study drug disease get bad doctor think best interest . Your participation study follow-up . Follow-Up : Every 6 month 3 year , either clinic visit call member study staff ask . If call , call last 15-20 minute . This investigational study . Atezolizumab FDA approve commercially available . It currently use research purpose . Nab-paclitaxel FDA approve commercially available treatment metastatic ( spread ) breast cancer . The study doctor explain study drug combination design work . Up 37 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
