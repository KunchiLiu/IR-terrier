	<brief_summary>It critical improve understand knee osteoarthritis design well therapeutic option disease . The function knee walk important factor development progression disease . Many model insole insert regular shoe objective improve function knee available market without prescription . Prior study insole fail report clear benefit patient , mainly result vary strongly person . Walking complex task well know everybody develop his/her individual way walking ( ie. , subtle important difference function knee ) . This observation fact patient response could vary individual suggest use standard insole patient might appropriate . This suggest care could greatly improve possible identify patient would respond positively model insole . Unfortunately , several randomize control trial conduct insole knee osteoarthritis , paucity data regard effect ambulatory function knee . Therefore , study aim improve understand regard effect insole freely available market term knee mechanic walk relation quality life . This study test hypothesis ( ) insoles effect static dynamic lower-limb function ( ii ) benefit perceive patient related mechanical effect produce insole .</brief_summary>
