	<brief_summary>Modify design CoSense device ( Model C20112 , currently clear FDA ETCO ( end-tidal carbon monoxide ) monitoring improve accuracy consistency temperature condition encounter country high prevalence SCD ( Sickle Cell Disease ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Carbon Monoxide Measurement Screen Sickle Cell Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Increase temperature operate range ETCO measurements 5 45°C . The signal output-to-CO ( carbon monoxide ) concentration correlation CO sensor dependent temperature . The new algorithm different approach current algorithm limit capability . We establish new specification determine performance bench model simulated temperature condition . We determine ability modify device distinguish SCD healthy control . During initial testing , examine validity ETCO measurement regulate room temperature hospital set . We enroll 20 subject , 10 SCD arm control arm determine mean variance ETCO value .</detailed_description>
