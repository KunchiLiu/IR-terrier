	<brief_summary>GABA ( gamma-aminobutyric acid ) main inhibitory neurotransmitter human brain . For year , drug enhance effect ( e.g. , benzodiazepine diazepam/Valium ) use treat various disease epilepsy , insomnia , anxiety movement disorder . However , use medication often compromised side effect , sleepiness , memory problem , addiction . Therefore , effort make develop drug act selectively brain exert positive therapeutic effect devoid unwanted side effect . AZD7325 one drug . It test 700 people far prove generally well tolerate . Positron emission tomography ( PET ) study human demonstrate AZD7325 bind GABA A receptor brain single dose . Early clinical study show less sedative cognitive adverse event compare benzodiazepine lorazepam . The investigator wish evaluate effect AZD7325 objectively measure healthy volunteer establish drug 's outcome could utilised study patient neurological disease . The investigator especially interested effect AZD7325 manual dexterity skin sensation hand . This assessed number simple non-invasive test object manipulation detection different sensory stimulus touch , vibration , temperature . Recent study show healthy individual perform good similar task GABA relevant area brain . If performance task healthy volunteer improve enhance GABA effect brain AZD7325 , would create ground use medication treat symptom certain neurological disorder motor control sensation hand impair ( e.g. , polyneuropathy ) .</brief_summary>
