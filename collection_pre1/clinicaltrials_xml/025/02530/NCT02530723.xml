	<detailed_description>Resistance training gain popularity age intervention since effective countering loss muscle mass strength senescence . Traditionally , strength training ( ST ) protocols elderly involve relatively heavy load ( 70-80 % maximum force ) focus increase strength . There evidence increase function strength training albeit inconsistent report literature . More recently , several study design resistance training program aim increase power rather strength , since finding indicate measure power well predictor physical function measure strength . In word , improve power may beneficial elderly susceptible functional limitation , mobility disability , dependency . Since difficult produce great deal power increase intensity , lift heavy load may relevant everyday function elderly , study investigate training improvement power rather traditional improvement strength . The effect power training ( PT ) versus ST functional outcome older adult vary , study show enhanced improvement function , others show difference function compare regular ST compare intervention walk . Discrepancies might result variety functional test use , mode training , variable frequency session per week , difference study length , adult vary functional status . It suggest perhaps standard 3-sessions-per-week frequency may optimal elderly . A previous investigation demonstrate effect PT 40 % 1-repetition maximum ( 1RM : high amount lift ) old adult comparable effect ST 80 % 1RM improvement similar two mode despite low daily rating perceive exertion ( RPE ) report PT ( PT : RPE leg press ( 12.2 ) knee extension ( 14.6 ) v ST : RPE leg press ( 15.1 ) knee extension ( 17 ) ) . Therefore , 'easier ' exercise training experience result sacrifice gain strength power . In theory , factor ( light load , low perceive exertion , similar strength power gain ) could affect adherence exercise research-related exercise intervention complete thus important consideration design train program . The purpose research investigate effect low-intensity ( 40 % 1RM ) PT functional outcome old woman .</detailed_description>
