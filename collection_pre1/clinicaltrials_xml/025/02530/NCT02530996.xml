	<brief_summary>Systemic sclerosis ( SSc ; scleroderma ) multi-organ systemic disease characterize activation immune cell , result vascular dysfunction ( vasculopathy ) subsequent scarring ( fibrosis ) . SSc high expect prevalence US military . On national level 5,766 SSc patient ( ICD-9 710.1 ) presently care Veterans Health Administration ( VHA ) . While cure SSc , study therapeutic help slow disease progression valuable Veterans . This proposal address solicitation project attention SSc request President Obama review potential contamination water Camp Lejeune . This proposal patient-centered outreach Veterans SSc inform prevent catastrophic endstage vascular abnormality , include digital ulcer , pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) scleroderma renal crisis SSc . The study propose novel application therapeutic disease . A good understanding initiating insult natural progression SSc vasculopathy need order develop therapeutic goal curing/treating underlying disease . This project potential impact Veterans SSc , also vascular abnormality include digital ulcer , PAH , renal crisis . This proposal represent potential major therapeutic advance Veterans SSc .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Systemic Sclerosis ( SSc ) Vasculopathy : Improved Clinical Monitoring Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although SSc heterogeneous extent organ involvement prognosis , accept SSc case progressive usually devastate course . Since vasculopathy precedes fibrosis disease , focus understanding natural history preventative measure vascular dysfunction profound implication . This pilot work suggest measurement endothelial dysfunction flow mediate dilatation ( FMD ) hold promise novel method ass disease progression well therapeutic efficacy pharmacologic compound tetrahydrobiopterin ( BH4 ) SSc . The investigator believe BH4 , target endothelium , great promise reduce SSc-related tissue hypoxia , end organ damage , potentially may impact underlie disease progression . The first aim adopt integrative approach validate novel , non-invasive technique , FMD define vasculopathy SSc . The second aim examine BH4 effective ameliorate vascular dysfunction patient SSc . The third aim determine role oxidative stress BH4-mediated improvement vascular function patient SSc . The overarch goal aim improve vasculopathy detection management Veterans SSc .</detailed_description>
