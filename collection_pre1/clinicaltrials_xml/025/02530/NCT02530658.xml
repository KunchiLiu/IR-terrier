	<brief_summary>The development next generation sequencing ( NGS ) technique , include whole genome ( WGS ) , exome ( WES ) RNA sequence revolutionized ability investigator query molecular mechanism underlie tumor formation . Through Pediatric Cancer Genome Project ( PCGP ) , investigator St. Jude Children 's Research Hospital ( SJCRH ) successfully use NGS approach evaluate 1,000 pediatric cancer range hematologic malignancy central nervous system ( CNS ) non-CNS solid tumor . From related study , become clear genomic approach accurately classify tumor distinct pathologic prognostic subtypes detect alteration cellular pathway may serve novel therapeutic target . Collectively , study suggest characterize genomic make-up individual tumor , investigator able develop personalize potentially effective cancer treatment and/or preventive measure . Despite recent advance , NGS approach yet routinely used part clinical care due high cost technical complexity , well many challenge relate data analysis translation clinical setting . The overarch goal protocol establish test process NGS technology , include WGS , WES RNA sequencing , offer pediatric oncology patient undergoing treatment SJCRH . This non-therapeutic study examine feasibility , acceptance impact clinical WGS , WES RNA sequence pediatric oncology set . Investigators anticipate sample size approximately 400 patient 400-800 biological parent .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : - To perform clinical next generation whole genome ( WGS ) , exome ( WES ) , RNA sequence SJCRH pediatric oncology patient prospectively 24-month period . - To use WGS , WES RNA sequence data identify characterize somatic genetic variant pathological significance germline genetic variant associate increase cancer risk . OTHER PRESPECIFIED OBJECTIVES : - To generate analyze data describe informed consent process patient/parent perception genomic investigation research . - To generate analyze data surround return genomic sequencing result , examine patient/parent understand result assess impact result patient family . - To determine feasibility reliability perform WES RNA sequence derivative formalin-fixed , paraffin-embedded ( FFPE ) tumor sample alongside analysis match frozen tumor germline sample . For participant give consent , tumor and/or normal tissue sample obtain used WGS , WES RNA sequence analysis . Once result analyse available , disclosed physician , patient parent . Mixed measure approach use ass understanding , acceptance impact genomic result patient parent . All tumor sample analyze via clinical genomics pipeline undergo routine clinical pathology test , run parallel study . Genetic variant deem reportable Clinical Genomics Committee consider return physician , patient parent several validation step . Genes tumor tissue analyze biological and/or clinical relevance report . A defined list 63 gene analyze report use normal ( germline ) tissue . During course study , investigator anticipate list gene report use normal tissue change due advance literature evidence link additional gene tumor formation cancer risk , new list may define . To assess provider , patient family understand describe impact genomic test return result , study also incorporate administration survey semi-structured interview . Surveys interview optional , offer primary SJCRH provider , well eligible participant parent , regardless whether consent pursue genomic testing . A sample blood skin biopsy obtain source germline DNA . This sample necessary comparator tumor sample evaluate . Skin biopsy may do patient diagnosis peripheral blood likely contaminate tumor cell .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>New St. Jude patient prospectively identified time study activation : Newly diagnose solid liquid tumor ( benign malignant ) , Relapsed solid liquid tumor ( benign malignant ) , Refractory solid liquid tumor ( benign malignant ) Current St. Jude patient develop new mass undergo surgical procedure establish diagnosis recurrent disease new primary tumor . Current St. Jude patient , therapy , develop refractory disease undergo surgical procedure palliate symptom . Adequate tissue must available ( e.g . sufficient germline and/or tumor tissue , &gt; 1 µg DNA &gt; 0.1 µg RNA must isolate ) . Patients retinoblastoma , diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma , craniopharyngioma , optic pathway tumor tumor tissue available may enroll use germline sample . Past history hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( condition would result hematopoietic cell DNA fail match host tissue DNA ) . Tumor germline tissue meeting criterion list . Inability unwillingness research participant legal guardian/representative give write informed consent . Participants unable read , write converse fluently English exclude Prespecified Objectives 3 4 .</criteria>
