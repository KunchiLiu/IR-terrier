	<brief_summary>The goal Phase 1B clinical research study find dose Taladegib give safely chemotherapy drug carboplatin paclitaxel radiotherapy patient esophageal gastroesophageal junction cancer . The goal Phase 2 clinical research study learn Taladegib give chemoradiation help control disease . The safety treatment combination continue study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Taladegib Combination With Weekly Paclitaxel , Carboplatin , Radiation Localized Adenocarcinoma Esophagus Gastroesophageal Junction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Central Venous Catheter ( CVC ) : If participant find eligible take part study , participant receive CVC participant already one . A CVC sterile flexible tube place large vein participant local anesthesia . Participant 's doctor explain procedure participant detail , participant require sign separate consent form procedure . Study Groups : Participant assign study group ( Phase 1B Phase 2 ) base participant join study . If participant Phase 1B , dose Taladegib participant receive base participant join study . Up 2 dos Taladegib test . Up 6 participant enrol dose level . Participant 's study doctor tell participant dose study drug participant receive compare dose participant receive . If participant Phase 2 , participant receive dose Taladegib find tolerable Phase 1B . Study Treatment : Phase IB Participant start Taladegib day participant begin chemoradiation . Participant take Taladegib every day participant complete chemoradiation . Phase 2 : If participant one first 27 participant enrol Phase 2 , participant take Taladegib 7 day participant begin chemoradiation . If participant join study 27 participant enrol , participant start Taladegib day participant begin chemoradiation . Participant continue take Taladegib every day participant complete chemoradiation . Phase 1B Phase 2 : Participant take Taladegib 1 time day mouth morning . Participant may take Taladegib without food . Each tablet take time morning . If participant forgets take dose , participant skip dose take next dose schedule . Participant need make missed dos . Participant ask record dos time take drug diary . Participant ask bring diary , along unused tablet pill bottle , study visit . Participant receive radiation every weekday 5 ½ week . Once week time , participant also receive paclitaxel vein 3 hour follow carboplatin vein 2 hour . Study Visits : Every week treatment Taladegib chemoradiation , blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw routine test . If participant become pregnant , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn pregnancy test every 2-4 week treatment . If participant enrol Phase 1B , every week participant physical exam . If participant enrol Phase 2 : - Every 2 week participant physical exam . - Participant endoscopy ultrasound biopsy perform 8 day participant 's first dose Taladegib biomarker test . Tests Before Surgery : Five ( 5 ) 6 week completion Taladegib chemoradiation , participant test check status disease help participant 's doctor decide participant surgery : - Participant physical exam . - Participant CT PET/CT scan . - Blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - Participant endoscopy ultrasound biopsy . If test show participant surgery , participant sign standard consent form surgery . Some tissue collect participant 's surgery use biomarker test . If participant able surgery , participant take study . Length Treatment : Participant 's treatment study participant finish Taladegib , chemoradiation , surgery , Taladegib chemoradiation alone participant surgery . Participant longer able take treatment disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , participant unable follow study direction . Participation study follow-up visit . Follow-Up Surgery : About 3 month surgery : - Participant physical exam . - Participant endoscopy , ultrasound ( need ) , biopsy perform . - Blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - If participant 's doctor think need , participant PET/CT CT scan . After Month 3 , every 3-6 month first year surgery : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - Participant PET/CT CT scan check status disease . Every 6 month Years 2 3 : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - Participant PET/CT CT scan check status disease . - If participant 's doctor think need , participant endoscopy ultrasound biopsy . At Years 4 5 : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - Participant PET/CT CT scan check status disease . Once study treatment complete , study staff continue follow participant 5 year . If participant stop come MD Anderson , participant contact phone every 3 month . The phone call last 5 minute . This investigational study . Taladegib FDA approve commercially available . It currently use research purpose . The study doctor explain study drug design work . The combination carboplatin , paclitaxel , radiation standard treatment cancer esophagus gastroesophageal junction . Up 66 participant enrol study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Histologically cytologically confirm adenocarcinoma esophagus gastroesophageal junction ( EAC ) . 2 . Male female patient whose age great equal 18 year ( Because nonclinical study suggest TALADEGIB may adversely affect development maintenance teeth , bone , growth plate pediatric population , child exclude study . In addition , EAC extremely rare child ) . 3 . Localized EAC baseline clinical stage determine : T2T3N0 T13N+ . Imaging study suspicious metastasis must follow negative biopsy patient enter study . 4 . Patients malignant celiac node eligible primary lesion midthoracic distal thoracic esophagus involve gastroesophageal junction . 5 . Tumor must label index great equal 5 % nuclear Gli1 ( integral biomarker perform MD Anderson Cancer Center CLIA laboratory ) patient eligible trial ( enough archival tissue available determine label index , patient must agree biopsy eligible study ) . 6 . Tumor may extend great 4 cm gastroesophageal junction . 7 . ECOG performance status 0 1 . 8 . All patient must willing provide research tumor tissue biomarker study baseline ( archival tumor tissue endoscopy sufficient archival tissue available ) . All patient must also allow biomarker study tissue obtain surgery remove primary cancer . 9 . Phase II : Patients volunteer Phase II part protocol must willing undergo research endoscopy tissue collection day 8 ( +/ 2 day ) begin therapy . 10 .
