	<brief_title>The Corrona , LLC Spondyloarthritis Psoriatic Arthritis ( SpA/PsA ) Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The epidemiology SpA le certain RA , partly relate lack understand general medical community vary clinical presentation various SpA subset , well evolve criterion disease classification . A recent estimate prevalence form SpA US 0.3 1.3 % general population.1 A recent NHANES study suggest though potentially high prevalence 1.4 % axial spondyloarthritis . 2 Given high estimate axial SpA 1.4 % could even underestimate give known prolonged delay diagnosis misdiagnosis , important learn disease management via registry data order educate potential stakeholder . Data SPARK survey , conduct Abbott rheumatology practice North America Europe , suggest SpA represent 40 % inflammatory arthritis manage survey rheumatology practice US . Of patient , 36 % PsA , 23 % AS , 18 % `` Undifferentiated SpA '' , 12 % Reactive Inflammatory Bowel-Related SpA.3 It likely patient classify `` undifferentiated '' classify either `` axialSpA '' `` peripheral SpA '' new ASAS criterion conditions.4,5 There significant unmet need develop clinical registry data presentation , natural history , management , outcomes SpA . There large clinical registry SpA patient see general rheumatology practice . It anticipate CORRONA 's registry supplement information gather program potentially represent general rheumatology spectrum SpA patient representative general population . Corrona 's objective create national cohort Spondyloarthritis patient care rheumatologist well understand epidemiology natural history disease , comorbidities , current treatment practice , response therapy outcomes related medication therapy . The primary goal registry systematically collect analyze longitudinal outcome associate spondyloarthritis . This include assess baseline characteristic , trend patient characteristic treatment pattern . Corrona evaluate prevalence rate comorbidities burden disease population . The registry design prospective , multicenter , observational registry patient spondyloarthritis psoriatic arthritis . It obtain longitudinal follow-up information via data collect patient treat rheumatologist every 6 month . The registry gather data disease duration , prognosis , disease severity activity , medical comorbidities , surgery , hospitalization , use medication laboratory image data . After enrollment visit , SpA patient physicians complete follow-up questionnaire regularly schedule clinical encounter . The goal collect data patient provider six month interval , exceed 2 visit 12 month period . Adverse event may volunteer spontaneously subject , discover result general questioning Principal Investigator . During CORRONA relate visit Principal Investigator , subject question regard occurrence adverse event .</detailed_description>
