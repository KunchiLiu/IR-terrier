	<brief_title>Prospective Study Non-operative Management SBO Without Nasogastric Tube Placement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study conduct prospective randomize design use patient population admit general surgery service Yale New Haven Hospital presenting presume diagnosis adhesive small bowel obstruction ( SBO ) Yale New Haven Hospital . All patient least 30 day prior abdominal operative procedure . Diagnosis SBO CT scan abdomen thereby exclude patient obstruction due incarcerate hernia minimize possibility obstruction due malignancy , volvulus cause . All patient select non-operative management attend physician eligible randomization either `` Nasogastric Tube Decompression '' `` No Decompression '' group . Eligible patient within 6 hour hospital admission naso-gastric tube ( NGT ) place . Patients NGT place emergency physician prior consultation emergency general surgery exclude . Patients require NGT placement prior approach enrollment prior randomization , agreeable , enrol prospective observational group patient data element collect . Study Procedures : Randomization : Once consent patient his/her surrogate obtain , eligible patient randomize either `` Nasogastric Tube Decompression '' `` No Decompression '' group . Sequentially numbered opaque seal envelope maintain locked office surgical critical care fellow surgical intensive care unit . The group assignment within envelope generate computerized random number table . Patients randomize nasogastric decompression NGT place within one hour randomization . Patient Management : If patient `` No Decompression '' group develop recurrent intractable emesis unresponsive anti-emetic medication deem unsafe trialed anti-emetic medication due change mental status attend physician NGT place followed third group patient fail management without NGT decompression . Recurrent and/or intractable emesis define two episode emesis least 50cc within twelve hour period single large volume emesis 300cc . For patient NGT placement mandatory however patient develop volume emesis NGT placement consider consistent protocol . Change mental status loosely define deterioration Glasgow Coma Scale ( GCS ) less 14 , however remain discretion attend physician . For patient failure NGT placement manage discretion attend surgeon analyze use intention treat methodology . All standard care patient SBO include intravenous fluid , correction electrolyte management chronic medical problem discretion attend surgeon . All patient monitor daily clinical examination development complication ( vomit , worsen abdominal pain , abnormal vital sign , leukocytosis , fever ) . Patients ' subjective comfort level also assess daily group use visual analog scale . Pain manage IV morphine unless allergy present develops case alternative narcotic use base decision treat physician . Improvement follow return bowel function , improve abdominal pain resolution symptom . The time take resolution symptom group follow , well relative number patient improve deteriorate . All care decision beyond initial NGT placement , choice anti-emetic choice analgesic discretion attend surgeon . These decision may include limited NGT placement removal , laboratory testing , image ( Abdominal X-rays and/or CT scan ) , diet advancement , need operative intervention . Should patient choose withdraw study point randomization management NGT also come within purview attend physician . This may include placement NGT patient randomize NGT arm removal even NGT place part protocol . Primary Outcomes : 1 . Hospital length stay Secondary Outcomes 1 . Pain level , measure visual analog scale document treat nurse . The maximum mean score day record . Pain also assess amount use . 2 . Duration NGT use hour . 3 . The number abdominal chest imaging test prior discharge operation whichever come first .</detailed_description>
