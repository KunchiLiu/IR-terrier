	<brief_title>Intra-articular Morphine Clonidine Injections Pain Management Hip Arthroscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Over last decade , use safety arthroscopic hip surgery considerably improve though evolution development arthroscopic image instrumentation ( Lynch et al. , 2013 ) . There still considerable amount room growth research comparison arthroscopic knee shoulder surgery , around much long . One area need attention postoperative pain management patient undergo hip arthroscopy . The benefit control postoperative pain range improve patient comfort decrease time recovery decrease narcotic medication usage reduce cost care ( Ramsay 2000 ) . Many study use morphine injection joint arthroscopic knee surgery demonstrate effectiveness reduce patient report pain narcotic medication usage surgery ( Stein et al. , 1991 ; Yari et al. , 2013 ; Zeng et al. , 2014 ) . Furthermore , study show joint injection clonidine improve pain relieve effect morphine two use combination ( Joshi et al. , 2000 ) . While considerable evidence support use joint injection morphine knee surgery , little cite use hip arthroscopy ( Lavelle et al. , 2007 ) . The purpose study well ass effectiveness morphine clonidine joint injection reduce patient report pain narcotic medication usage hip arthroscopy . Protocol : Participants study part trial use morphine clonidine joint injection hip surgery . Participants randomly select either receive standard dose morphine clonidine normal saline solution joint injection . The normal saline active drug ingredient . In either case injection occur conclusion surgery . The joint injection change medical care occur patient decide participate study . Pain level monitor treat surgery , pain management surgery follow normal standard care . Additionally , participant ask fill brief questionnaire surgery . All patient send home short diary allow record medication usage , pain score , potential side effect week follow surgery . The diary information return patient come back standard-of-care two week follow-up appointment . No additional visit appointment beyond procedure already entail need participate study . The treatment ( morphine/clonidine normal saline injection ) chosen chance , like flip coin . Neither participant study doctor choose treatment patient get . There equal chance give either treatment . Neither participant study doctor know treatment assign . Morphine clonidine FDA-approved drug use non-approved context ( hip injection ) . All standard care procedure take place ensure patient safety surgery , patient outpatient surgical center . All adverse event properly document report IRB . Data Management : Data point include age , sex , height , weight , tobacco use , VAS pain score , discharge time , duration surgery , discharge criterion score , medication use , score QoR-15 survey . All information include personally identifying information , name medical record number , enter database medical information . Identifying information enter separate database link patient arbitrary study number . Statistical analysis data include Student 's T-Test , non-parametric Mann Whitney test , chi-square test . If substantial data miss subject , would otherwise essential analysis , subject 's information particular analysis exclude . To best extent possible , data interpolate utilized .</detailed_description>
