	<brief_summary>The purpose study analyze pre- intra-operative joint aspirate native joint joint suspicion periprosthetic joint infection ( PJI ) hip , knee shoulder acquire clinical routine . Joint aspirate analyze new diagnostic method ( microcalorimetry , PCR , alpha-defensin , etc. ) . Diagnostic speed accuracy method compare standard diagnostic method clinical routine , blood culture joint aspirate , cell count/differential , intra-operative tissue culture histology sonication .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In study , joint aspirate patient undergo joint aspiration context routine pre- intra-operative clinical diagnosis hip , knee shoulder joint collect . Routine joint puncture clinic regularly perform emergency room , outpatient clinic intra-operatively diagnostic revision surgery . A minimum 5 ml aspiration fluid require inclusion study . Empty dilute aspiration exclude . Joint aspiration perform orthopaedic surgeon 18-gauge needle accord standardized aseptic technique . Intraoperative puncture perform prior arthrotomy . A minimum 1ml joint aspirate immediately transfer native study vial study , native vial gram stain culture native vial polarization microscopy , respectively . A minimum 1 ml joint aspirate transfer ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( EDTA ) vial determination leucocyte count . Finally , minimum 1 ml inoculate paediatric blood culture bottle . Standard microbiological method perform external laboratory routinely collaborate clinic . Leucocyte count perform automatically mention EDTA vial . Polarization microscopy perform pathohistological department order detect crystal sign infection joint aspirate . If write informational consent sign patient , study vial immediately transport internal laboratory analysis new diagnostic method ( microcalorimetry , PCR , etc. ) . When immediate transportation feasible , vial store cool fridge +3Â° C transportation possible . Each case individually review classified experienced infectiologist take case 's clinical history laboratory result account .</detailed_description>
