	<brief_title>Responsiveness MID 4 Metre Gait Speed Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This observational study investigate simple test usual walking speed , measure use 4 metre gait speed ( 4MGS ) test patient lung disease call Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis ( IPF ) . Drug development disease slow part lack reliable measurement assess effectiveness treatment . Slow walk speed show relate poor outcome older adult people another lung disease call Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) . The investigator interested see whether usual walk speed IPF patient change follow treatment call pulmonary rehabilitation ( exercise education programme patient lung disease ) change , small change meaningful patient ( minimum important difference - MID ) . The investigator also investigate whether change walk speed predict survival , number hospital admission lung disease progression . This help inform u potential use 4MGS outcome measure . To , participant consent take part study time walk usual walk speed distance 4 metre ( 13.12 foot ) course pulmonary rehabilitation follow-up 1 year complete pulmonary rehabilitation .</detailed_description>
