	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate pidilizumab effect , bad and/or good , immune system relation ability fight cancer cell . Many cancer bring phase call complete remission ( cancer find ) chance may come back . Researchers work improve therapy find new drug low chance disease come back . This study use drug call pidilizumab . The drug target immune system . It change immune system find cancer cell . The drug may kill remain cancer cell see compute tomography ( CT ) scan . The drug , pidilizumab , study cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pidilizumab Treating Patients With Stage III-IV Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma Following First Remission</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate rate response , whereby either cluster differentiation ( CD ) 4+CD25+programmed death 1 ligand 1 ( PD-L1 ) + T lymphocytes CD4+CD62L+CD127+ T lymphocytes `` increase '' follow administration pidilizumab patient diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) complete induction chemotherapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine toxicity tolerability pidilizumab therapy follow induction chemotherapy . II . To estimate progression free survival ( PFS ) 2 year . III . To estimate overall survival ( OS ) 2 year . IV . To estimate time second line chemotherapy ( TSLC ) 2 year . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To characterize programmed death 1 ( PD-1 ) pathway specific expression marker diagnostic biopsy specimen . II . To characterize serum biomarkers immune inflammatory response treatment pidilizumab . III . To characterize level soluble PD-L1 related treatment pidilizumab . OUTLINE : Patients receive pidilizumab intravenously ( IV ) approximately 5 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 42 day 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion treatment , patient follow 30 day every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
