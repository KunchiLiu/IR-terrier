	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study well photoacoustic image work detect ovarian fallopian tube cancer . Photoacoustic image image method us laser light tissue , convert light information ultrasound image . Photoacoustic image provide image structure tissue , well function level molecule , flow blood blood vessel level oxygen blood . Photoacoustic imaging may help doctor determine whether mass benign ( non-cancerous ) cancerous base molecular difference cancer normal tissue . It may accurate less expensive imaging method , expose patient radiation .</brief_summary>
