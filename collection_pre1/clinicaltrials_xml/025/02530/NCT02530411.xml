	<brief_title>Fulvestrant +/- Vandetanib Advanced Aromatase Inhibitor Resistant Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For patient advanced breast cancer spread around body , hormone therapy often best treatment . As well effective , mean patient experience toxicity inconvenience chemotherapy . However , eventually cancer likely become resistant hormone therapy situation , although hormone drug use , sometimes work well . So important find way get cancer respond hormone treatment . There many different way breast cancer cell become resistant hormone treatment , include 'signalling ' pathway cell call RET [ Receptor tyrosine kinase RET ] REarranged Transfection . Research show increase activity RET signalling pathway hormone resistant cancer cell . Vandetanib oral drug inhibits RET signal cell show laboratory study prevent growth breast cancer cell become resistant hormone therapy . Hormone therapy drug include tamoxifen , aromatase inhibitor ( anastrozole , letrozole exemestane ) . The investigator therefore believe give vandetanib together hormone therapy may help prevent resistance treatment patient breast cancer . In trial investigator combine drug fulvestrant , another hormone therapy drug sometimes use alone patient develop resistance aromatase inhibitor , tamoxifen . So patient enter trial one drug , fulvestrant , know work may also give experimental drug , vandetanib . To properly determine vandetanib work investigator believe , study compare activity vandetanib combine fulvestrant fulvestrant combine inactive , 'placebo ' tablet group patient treatment single agent fulvestrant think appropriate . The investigator plan recruit total 160 patient . Half give fulvestrant vandetanib half give fulvestrant placebo , treatment particular patient get choose random chance . Neither patient patient doctor know whether patient get vandetanib inactive placebo . The important measure effect time cancer grows , study also look closely side effect drug . The investigator also look whether way individual respond relate result laboratory study RET pathway carry previously store tumour sample . This mean patient need additional biopsy sample take .</detailed_description>
