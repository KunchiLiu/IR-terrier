	<brief_title>A Tolerance Trial Cinobufacini Injection Intraperitoneal Perfusion Digestive System Cancer With Ascites</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To evaluate tolerance safety cinobufacini injection intraperitoneal treatment digestive system cancer patient malignant ascites , propose dosage regimens future clinical trial . A single-arm , non-randomized , open , drug tolerance trial conduct . The clinical trial divide two part , include single successive administration.The single administration include 7 group , dose escalate 15ml 180ml , 2-6 patient per dose level . Central venous catheter preserve drainage ascites , drainage ascites , slowly inject dilute concentration cinobufacini injection escalate dosage catheter . This treatment give , volunteer observe 24 hour . Then evaluate observation index , include adverse event , vital sign , electrocardiogram , blood routine , urine routine , hepatic renal function , etc . The successive administration include 2 group , accord result single administration , choose second large tolerance dose conduct 1st group successive administration . If significant adverse effect , drop lower dose conduct 2nd group ; trial show adverse effect , upgrade higher dose ( maximum tolerate dose ) conduct 2nd group . The treatment give 3 time week , 2 week period . Adverse effect evaluate treatment .</detailed_description>
