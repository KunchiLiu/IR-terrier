	<brief_summary>Often less experienced medical student charge role camera navigator assistant laparoscopic surgery . Camera navigation generally consider easy skill , require specific psychomotor visuospatial skill . Simulation-based training improve surgical skill , little know optimally structure train program acquire camera navigation skill . The objective trial examine simulation-based laparoscopic camera navigation skill transfer operate room practice one two fundamentally different laparoscopic task simulator . The first group practice procedure virtual reality simulator , second group practice camera navigation virtual reality simulator third group receive training . All participant test camera navigator assistants procedure operating room .</brief_summary>
