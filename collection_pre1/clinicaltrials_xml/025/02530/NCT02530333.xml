	<brief_summary>Anterior cruciate ligament injury program less successful woman 's basketball soccer player , yet reason discrepancy unknown . Thus , study recruit high school age girl 's basketball soccer player , randomized team control experimental group , administer ACL injury prevention program experimental group compare two group low extremity biomechanics completion program . Biomechanical analyse help determine extent woman 's basketball soccer player respond differently uniform injury prevention program , whether prevention program provide adequate stimulus improve low extremity biomechanics basketball-specific task .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Differential Biomechanical Effects ACL Injury Prevention Program Women 's Basketball Soccer Players</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL ) injury prevention program considerably less successful woman 's basketball woman 's soccer . Women 's basketball soccer characterize distinct sport-specific demand , woman 's basketball player perform significantly frequent jumping ( 2- 1-legged landing ) frontal plane movement woman 's soccer player . Despite vary sport-specific demand , ACL injury prevention program uniformly administer sport , emphasize improve high-risk biomechanics 2-legged sagittal plane task . As , may provide appropriate stimulus reduce ACL injury risk high-risk demand associated woman 's basketball . To date , differential biomechanical adaptation result ACL injury prevention program woman 's basketball soccer never investigate . This study use cluster randomize control trial use repeated measure design . Participants randomize ( team ) control intervention group . Participants control group ask continue normal daily athletic activity ( practice , game ) without participate distinct injury prevention training . Participants intervention group complete 6 week ACL injury prevention program previously describe literature effective reduce ACL injury risk . The prevention program last 20-25 minute duration take place warm-up prior practice . The frequency depend solely number practice team hold throughout give 6-week time period . A member research team plan intervention session . All participant complete pre- post-testing approximately 1 week onset completion prevention program , respectively . As state previously , pre- post-testing perform High Point University Human Biomechanics Physiology Laboratory . The follow Specific Aims Hypotheses . Specific Aim 1 . To determine extent woman 's basketball soccer player employ distinct low extremity movement strategy sagittal frontal plane jump landing task . Hypothesis 1 . Prior training , woman 's basketball athletes exhibit significant difference high-risk hip knee kinematics , generate high hip knee joint moment jump land activity woman 's soccer player . Specific Aim 2 . To determine response woman 's basketball soccer athletes 6-week ACL injury prevention program , measure change multi-planar hip knee biomechanics jump landing sagittal frontal plane jump landing task . Hypothesis 1 . After 6 week training , high-risk biomechanics improve large extent sagittal plane frontal plane jump landing task . Hypothesis 2 . After 6 week training , significant difference biomechanical change woman 's basketball compare woman 's soccer player .</detailed_description>
