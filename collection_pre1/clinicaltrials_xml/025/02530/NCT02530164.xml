	<brief_summary>Major depressive disorder ( MDD ) common , recurrent , frequent chronic disorder . Treatment often challenge ; estimate 20-40 % patient benefit sufficiently exist antidepressant intervention include trial medication psychotherapy . A 15-25 % patient manifest chronic , treatment-resistant course illness , result need additional treatment option . Brain stimulation technique consider promising therapeutic approach affective disorder like MDD . Transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) non-invasive brain stimulation method largely investigated experimental neuroscience tDCS prefrontal cortex ( PFC ) propose novel treatment MDD . In large 2x2 factorial randomize control trial MDD date , Brunoni et al . ( 2013 ) show tDCS combine Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor ( SSRI ; sertraline ) result antidepressant efficacy superior placebo treatment , tDCS alone sertraline alone . The purpose study explore sustain efficacy tolerability repeat tDCS treatment MDD . It hypothesize prefrontal tDCS combination SSRI provoke antidepressant effect antidepressant medication alone ( sham tDCS ) . This measured change baseline Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) score 6 week treatment . In randomized , placebo-controlled multicenter trial ( 5 center involve ) patient diagnosis MDD receive 6-weeks treatment prefrontal tDCS ( anode electrode position F3 , cathode F4 , 5 sessions/week 4 week follow 2 sessions/week 2 week , 24 treatment sum , 30min/day , 2mA intensity ) sham tDCS ( frequency duration correspondent active tDCS , ramp ramp period without intermittent stimulation ) , adjunctive treatment SSRI . Follow-up per patient 3 6 month last tDCS treatment session . Before , treatment period different assessment scale conduct record neuropsychological feature course individual symptomatology .</brief_summary>
