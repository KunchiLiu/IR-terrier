	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study find high tolerable dose Hu8F4 give patient advance leukemia . This first study use Hu8F4 human .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Study Hu8F4 Patients With Advanced Hematologic Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign dose level Hu8F4 base join study . Up 5 dose level Hu8F4 test . One ( 1 ) -6 participant enrol dose level . The first group participant receive low dose level . Each new group receive high dose group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose Hu8F4 find . Once high tolerable dose find , additional participant enrol least 6 participant cancer type enrol . Additional 3 group 10 participant may add specific leukemia type `` expansion group '' high tolerable dose find . Study Drug Administration : You receive Hu8F4 vein 30 minute Days 0 , 7 , 14 , 21 28-day cycle . Study Visits : Before take study drug bone marrow biopsy/aspiration . To collect bone marrow biopsy/aspirate , area hip site numb anesthetic , small amount bone marrow bone withdrawn large needle . During Week 1 Cycle 1 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . If test perform within 3 day , need repeat . - If child , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) urine collect pregnancy test . - Blood ( 4 tablespoon ) draw receive study drug test effect Hu8F4 test antibody Hu8F4 . Antibodies create immune system may attack foreign cell substance , study drug . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon time ) drawn pharmacokinetic ( PK ) test 7 time 24 hour dose . PK test measure amount study drug body different time point . On Days 2-14 Cycles 1 2 , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw PK test . During Weeks 2-4 Cycle 1 , blood ( 5 tablespoon ) draw routine test , check effect Hu8F4 , test antibody Hu8F4 . During Week 4 Cycle 1 , bone marrow biopsy/aspiration check status disease . During Week 1 Cycle 2 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . If test perform within 3 day , need repeat . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw check effect Hu8F4 antibody test . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon time ) drawn 7 time 24 hour receive study drug PK testing . During Weeks 2-4 Cycles 2 3 , blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw routine test . At Week 2 Cycle 2 , blood also use check antibody Hu8F4 . During Week 1 Cycle 3 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . If test perform within 3 day , need repeat . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw check effect Hu8F4 . During Week 1 Cycles 4 beyond : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw check effect Hu8F4 . Every 2-4 week Cycles 4 beyond , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . Every 1-3 cycle , bone marrow aspiration check status disease . Length Study : You may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . End treatment : Once longer take study drug , blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw test antibody Hu8F4 . This investigational study . Hu8F4 FDA approve commercially available . It currently use research purpose . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 60 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
