	<brief_title>Continuous Glucose Monitor Children With Poorly Controlled Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial design six month , randomize , prospective , interventional pilot study child uncontrolled ( HgbA1c &gt; 8.5 % ) diabetes ages 7-17 year age . The purpose study determine effect glycemic control measure HgbA1c use iPro™ CGM regularly schedule clinic appointment . Recruitment study limit patient University Texas Health Science Center San Antonio Pediatric Diabetes Clinic May 2011 March 2013 . Subjects randomize Group1 Group 2 use sequentially number , opaque seal envelope ( SNOSE ) . All subject point-of-care HgbA1c ( standard care ) CGM data collect time point 0 , 3 month , 6 month . After regularly schedule clinic appointment , subject family time 0 counsel registered dietician regard carbohydrate counting focus minimize error carbohydrate estimation , standard care patient poorly control diabetes clinic . At time 0 , subject Group 1 2 CGM placement meeting dietician . Group 1 subject blind first CGM data , mean review CGM download data . Group 2 schedule return clinic within 2 week placement meet pediatric endocrinologist involve study interpret CGM result make adjustment insulin regimen appropriate . Both Groups 1 2 blind CGM data 3 month 6 month . Again , CGM place regularly schedule diabetes clinic appointment family return within 2 week visit meet pediatric endocrinologist interpret data adjust insulin regimen necessary . The iPro™ CGM wear minimum 48 hour ( 2 day ) , maximum 96 hour ( 4 day ) . Participants instruct complete minimum 4 SMBG record daily wear iPro™ CGM system calibration purpose . Subjects document SMBGs , meal time , carbohydrate intake , insulin dos , exercise , hypoglycemic symptom log book correlation CGM data .</detailed_description>
