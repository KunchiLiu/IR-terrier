	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : - Part A : To evaluate safety SAR650984 ( isatuximab ) patient relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma ( RRMM ) . - Part B : To evaluate activity SAR650984 ( isatuximab ) assess overall response rate ( ORR ) RRMM patient previously treat daratumumab Secondary Objectives : - Part A : - To determine pharmacokinetics ( PK ) SAR650984 ( isatuximab ) patient RRMM . - Part B : - To evaluate safety SAR650984 ( isatuximab ) . - To evaluate efficacy SAR650984 ( isatuximab ) assess duration response ( DOR ) , clinical benefit rate ( CBR ) progression free survival ( PFS ) . - To assess pharmacokinetics ( PK ) SAR650984 ( isatuximab ) . - To evaluate immunogenicity SAR650984 ( isatuximab ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Safety , Pharmacokinetics , Efficacy Isatuximab Patients With Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study duration individual patient include screen period inclusion 3 week , treatment period , follow period . Treatment SAR650984 ( isatuximab ) may continue disease progression , unacceptable adverse event , reason discontinuation . After study treatment discontinuation , end treatment visit do 30 day assess safety PK , 30 60 day ADA . If ADA positive Day 60 , ADA repeat every 30 day ADA negative . Patients partial remission well discontinue treatment reason progression disease follow monthly progression initiation subsequent therapy , final analysis cutoff date , whichever come first .</detailed_description>
