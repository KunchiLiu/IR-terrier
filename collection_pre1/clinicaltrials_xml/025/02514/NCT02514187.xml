	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate technetium-99m ( 99mTc ) pertechnetate produce cyclotron replacement 99mTc pertechnetate obtain generator contain parent isotope Molybdenum-99 ( 99Mo ) . 99mTc pertechnetate currently use nuclear medicine department across country . 99Mo produce number age nuclear reactor across world severe shortage isotope occur past year . Cyclotron-produced 99mTc offer alternative decentralize production method regional basis . Since manufacture process different , safety efficacy cyclotron-produced 99mTc pertechnetate must evaluate human subject enable routine clinical use .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>WHO performance status 02 Older age majority province study perform , able consent project Ambulatory able lie supine duration examination . Able willing return subsequent visit within 7 day undergo repeat examination participate followup phone call monitor adverse event . Subject refer nuclear medicine examination one follow indication : Biochemically document hyperthyroidism , refer scintigraphy evaluate differential diagnosis hyperthyroidism plan radioiodine treatment . Referred bone scintigraphy evaluation metastasis , fracture , inflammatory condition . Subjects refer limited area ( localize ) bone scan eligible , provide agree undergo wholebody scan part procedure . Pregnant , plan become pregnant within 30 day Severe evolve health problem ( unstable coronary disease , liver failure , heart failure , endstagerenal failure , hospitalize subject severe medical condition ) may confound assessment adverse event . For subject evaluate hyperthyroidism : Recent iodinecontaining IV contrast administration ( &lt; 6 week ) Recent amiodarone usage ( &lt; 8 week ) Ongoing antithyroid medication ( methimazole propylthiouracil ; drug must discontinue prior thyroid image describe ) For subject evaluate bone scintigraphy : â€¢ Recent trauma occur less 24 hour prior first 99mTc bone scintigraphy examination , first second 99mTc bone scintigraphy examination . Women breastfeed eligible participate study , must cease breastfeed 24 hour follow 99mTc examination . They draw milk discard period , use either formula previously collect milk feed child .</criteria>
