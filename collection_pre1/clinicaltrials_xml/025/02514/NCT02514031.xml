	<detailed_description>Screening : - Demographic information ( age , gender , race , ethnic origin ) . - Physical exam review past present medical history include surgery and/or infection ; - Vital sign ( temperature , pulse , respiration , blood pressure ) ; height , weight ; - Concurrent medication ( medication whether prescribed over-the counter take currently take ) ; - Performance Status ( well able perform daily activity ) - Review side effect may experience may experience receive study drug medication - Blood collect routine lab test - Urinalysis - Pregnancy Test ( woman child-bearing potential ) - Radiologic evaluation ( review CT scan may ) - Tumor measurement : - A CT scan ( chest/abdomen/pelvis ) special test produce image body use a. small amount radiation . The image show body tissue structure three dimension ( 3-D ) . - Electrocardiogram ( EKG ) , trace electrical activity heart ; - Oxygen saturation ( measure much oxygen blood carry ) - Biopsy correlative study - archive tumor specimen obtain , need undergo fresh biopsy - Completion Quality life questionnaire This visit may last approximately 1-2 hour .
