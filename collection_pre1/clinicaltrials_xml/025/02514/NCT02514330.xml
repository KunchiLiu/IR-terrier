	<brief_summary>The objective present study determine effect interval session run high intensity 1 % 10 % gradient height drop jump . The cinematic variable concentric phase , eccentric contact time compare run session condition order explain possible change jump performance . The investigator theorize low eccentric overload run 10 % inclination promote high deleterious effect power performance low limb</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Physical training program typically composed activity direct development different valence usually stimulate session . When aerobic activity long duration prior isokinetic strength exercise , isotonic , explosive , deleterious effect seem induced performance valence . These short long-term change muscle strength power would directly associate repetitive eccentric load characterize endurance run . Gradual increase run slope inversely associate proportional reduction eccentric load , turn would result less muscle damage intra extrafusal fiber . So , change slope race would emerge optional way neutralize competitive effect power performance . The research consist five visit . At initial visit conduct familiarization vertical drop jump , immediately , determination VO2max value associate speed ( vVO2max ) . The second visit new familiarization vertical drop jump follow immediately determine Time exhaustion performance vVO2max ( 100 % VO2Max ) . Two jump perform three select height ( 20 , 30 40 cm ) use experimental session control height associate high performance . In subsequent visit ( third fifth ) , participant perform three maximum jump 10 min follow condition : high intensity Interval run 10 % gradient ( C10 % ) , 1 % grade ( C1 % ) control condition ( CON ) .</detailed_description>
