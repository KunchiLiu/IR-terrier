	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate pharmacokinetics paracetamol , amoxicillin talinolol morbid adipose subject well shortly one year proximal Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass ( RYGB ) measure messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA ) expression protein content duodenal and/or jejunal drug metabolize enzyme ( eg . cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 3A4 ( CYP3A4 ) , uridine diphosphoglucuronosyltransferase ( UGTs ) ) drug transport protein ( e.g . P-glycoprotein , MRP2 , OATPB , PEPT ) operation one year proximal RYGB .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Intestinal drug absorption appear complex process characterize gastrointestinal transit , disintegration dosage form , drug dissolution within intestinal lumen , active passive uptake process , mucosal metabolism ( e.g . cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) , UGT , sulfotransferase ( SULT ) enzymes ) efflux transport several adenosine triphosphate binding cassette ( ABC ) transporters P-glycoprotein , multidrug resistance associate protein ( MRP ) 2 breast cancer resistance protein ( BCRP ) . Along gastrointestinal tract , upper small intestine ( i.e . duodenum , proximal jejunum ) represent main site absorption nutrient drug offer appropriately large absorption area nearly 200 m² . Within bowel segment , high expression several physiological relevant uptake carrier nutrient carbohydrate ( e.g . GLUTs ) , fatty acid ( MCTs , FATs ) , peptide ( PEPTs ) , sterol ( NPC1L1 ) bile acid ( ASBT ) exclusively locate small intestine . Furthermore , well establish high intestinal expression phase I &amp; II metabolizing enzymes well drug efflux transporter responsible high first-pass metabolism many compound like cyclosporine , nifedipine , midazolam statin . Apparently , distinct expression gradient along small intestine ( e.g . decreasing level P-gp CYP3A4 increase MRP2 ) . On side , colon feature negligible amount enzymes active uptake elimination carrier . Therefore , extent drug absorption bowel mainly dependent intestinal site drug liberation , thus , dependent administer dosage form , physicochemical property drug individual physiological condition . Due fact , physiological circumstance low expression P-gp upper part gut ( i.e . duodenum jejunum ) , functional `` absorption window '' create enables preferable absorption drug proximal region small intestine . This also support markedly high surface area upper small intestine compare distal segment . It show cyclosporine talinolol increasingly less absorbed deliver deep region human intestine . Since compound well establish P-gp substrate , site-dependent absorption phenomenon seem cause decrease expression level intestinal P-gp counteract drug uptake enterocytes . Additionally , report effective permeability atenolol , metoprolol , cimetidine furosemide markedly low ileum compare jejunum healthy subject . These data verify drug absorption low intestine less effective upper part seem outstanding relevance compound predominately duodenal jejunal absorption ( fast release dosage form ) P-gp substrates ß-lactam antibiotic , furosemide , cyclosporine , talinolol digoxin . Consequently , subject massive dissection proximal small intestine Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery , absence main intestinal absorption area lead malabsorption nutrient ( e.g . protein , fat soluble vitamin , mineral trace element iron ) expect affect oral bioavailability drug `` absorption window '' proximal small intestine . Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery , stomach , duodenum part jejunum dislocate continuous intestinal passage chyme , surgical gold standard option treat morbid adipositas . The method show reduce significantly body weight obesity-related co-morbidity . Today , surgical intervention frequently use bariatric surgery ( USA : approximately 150.000/year ) application still increase . Despite widely use well document risk nutrient deficiency , little know pharmacokinetic consequence intestinal adaptation mechanism patient often subject multiple drug therapy . It assume reduced intestinal surface area reduce time drug disintegration dissolution cause accelerated intestinal transit patient associate lowered intestinal drug absorption . Additionally , could affect reduce production gastric hydrochloric acid lower solubility case alkaline drug . However , possible compensatory process bowel segment could improve drug absorption could mean drug still adequately absorb . From patient resection lower intestinal segment ( i.e . distal jejunum , ileum , colon ) consequence Crohn´s disease ulcerative colitis , so-called small bowel syndrome , know pharmacokinetics drug digoxin , cyclosporine , cimetidine levothyroxine markedly influence form distinctly reduce intestinal absorption . Furthermore , assess time-dependent adaptation process occur patient compensate lose function dissect tissue . Therefore , dependency parenteral nutrition decrease even full intestinal autonomy occur . The variety change complex dependent status underlie disease , exist surface area functional integrity . These complex adaptation process cause many growth factor , cytokine hormone ( e.g . peptide tyrosine tyrosine ( YY ) , insulin like growth factor ( IGF ) , epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) , glucagon-like peptide ( GLP-2 ) , NT ) . Most data adaptive process gastrointestinal tract dissection intestinal segment obtain animal experiment . These data , however , predictive situation man . With regard situation Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery , information drug absorb bypass stomach , duodenum part jejunum . Therefore , pharmacokinetics three probe drug ( talinolol , paracetamol amoxicillin ) intestinal expression intestinal drug metabolize enzyme ( eg . CYP3A4 , UGTs ) drug transport protein ( eg . P-gp , MRP2 , OATPB , PEPT ) , shortly ( 7 day ) one year gastric intestinal bypass surgery patient morbid adipositas measure . Paracetamol ( acetaminophen ) choose rapidly completely absorbed part gut . Appearance blood describes site drug dissolution within intestine . Talinolol represent well establish P-gp substrate absorption limit multidrug transporting protein . Finally , amoxicillin act probe drug active uptake mediate peptide transporter PEPT predominately express small intestine responsible active H+-coupled uptake ß-lactam antibiotic ACE inhibitor . It hypothesize bioavailability talinolol amoxicillin significantly decrease Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery compare situation surgery . One year surgical intervention , adaptation process expression drug metabolize enzyme drug transporter expect least part compensate decrease bioavailability probe drug .</detailed_description>
