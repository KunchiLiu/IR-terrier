	<brief_summary>A malignant tumor high temperature normal tissue temperature tumor dependent tumor growth rate . Thus tumor temperature universal indicator tumor activity . The temperature change begin stage atypical hyperplasia increase proliferation open possibility detection patient high risk lesion . Microwave radiometer ( RTM-01-RES ) allow measurement temperature change internal tissue depth several centimetre allow visualization temperature thermogram temperature field . It noninvasive measurement internal temperature base receive natural electromagnetic radiation tissue gigahertz ( GHz ) frequency range . The device absolutely harmless risk emit radiation . It use repeatedly method monitoring . Microwave radiometry successfully complete seven clinical trial 1000 patient different country . Microwave device ( RTM-01-RES ) use 300 medical center 30 country . Medical technology microwave radiometry include nomenclature medical service Russian Federation , Ministry Health part standard care patient malignant tumor breast . This method microwave radiometry recommend leading Russian mammalogist National guideline breast care . The investigator would like use device clinic Scotland later United Kingdom ( UK ) breast diagnosis monitoring treatment . During 3 month investigator aim examine 150 patient breast cancer 150 patient without cancer control group . The result temperature measurement compare result histology , particular , tumour cellulants p53 expression gene expression data metabolic biomarkers tumor indicator . Statistical analysis data perform . The device initial training provide RES Company ( device producer ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The temperature malignant tumour universal indicator growth rate tumor . Tumor temperature use prediction benefit individual therapy monitor efficacy breast cancer treatment . The temperature tissue around malignant tumour correlate micro vessel density ( MVD ) - main indicator angiogenesis . A traditional infrared camera allow measurement temperature skin breast tumor depth several centimetre . It well known possible detect thermal abnormality internal tissue help measure natural electromagnetic radiation microwave frequency range . Microwave radiometer ( RTM-01-RES ) allow one measure noninvasively temperature change internal tissue depth several centimetre visualize internal temperature thermogram temperature field . It show device use detection carotid temperature abnormalities temperature carotid good correlation risk stroke patient . Today technically possible obtain non-invasively information concern thermal activity tumor use information prediction individual therapy monitor efficacy breast cancer treatment . The clinical trial Russia show tumor low degree malignancy low temperature change tumor high degree malignancy high temperature change . Seven clinical trial ( RTM-01-RES ) 1000 patient show 90 % breast malignant tumours substantial temperature change ( sensitivity 85 % -95 % , specificity 56 % -75 % ) . The standard care patient malignant tumor breast use microwave radiometry recommend leading Russian mammalogist National guideline breast care . Given temperature malignant tumor high benign lesion temperature proliferative thus poor outlook cancer great less proliferative cancer , aim whether date technology temperature measure accurately skin . The benefit device would 1 . Diagnostic - help differentiate benign malignant lesion . 2 . Prognostic - provide insight proliferation rate use non-invasive test . 3 . Predictive benefit - show change temperature predate change tumor volume patient treated drug therapy initially . The investigation non-invasive . If possible demonstrate benefit , simple non-invasive test could useful role assess patient breast lump particularly breast cancer .</detailed_description>
