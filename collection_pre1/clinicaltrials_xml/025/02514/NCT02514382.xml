	<brief_summary>This phase Ib trial study safety best dose wild-type reovirus combination bortezomib dexamethasone see well work treat patient multiple myeloma return ( relapse ) respond treatment ( refractory ) . A virus , call wild-type reovirus , may able infect cancer cell slow cancer growth kill cancer cell . Bortezomib dexamethasone may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving wild-type reovirus together bortezomib dexamethasone may better treatment multiple myeloma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) maximum REOLYSIN ( wild-type reovirus ) dose limit 4.5 x 10^10 tissue culture infection dose ( TCID ) 50 safety profile REOLYSIN combination bortezomib dexamethasone patient relapse refractory multiple myeloma ( MM ) . ( Phase 1b ) II . To explore safety tolerability combination determine overall response rate ( ORR ) ( complete response [ CR ] + partial response [ PR ] ) REOLYSIN combination bortezomib dexamethasone patient relapse refractory MM . ( Phase 1b Dose Expansion ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine ORR Phase 1b part combination escalate dos . II . To determine progression-free survival ( PFS ) patient relapse refractory MM treat REOLYSIN combination bortezomib dexamethasone . III . To evaluate effect REOLYSIN combination bortezomib dexamethasone treatment overall survival ( OS ) . IV . To conduct pharmacodynamic study describe . OUTLINE : This phase Ib , dose-escalation study wild-type reovirus follow phase Ib expansion trial . Patients receive dexamethasone orally ( PO ) , intravenously ( IV ) , intramuscularly ( IM ) bortezomib subcutaneously ( SC ) ( preferably ) IV 3-5 second day 1 , 8 , 15 . Patients also receive wild-type reovirus IV 60 minute day 1 , 2 , 8 , 9 , 15 , 16 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 month every 3 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
