	<brief_summary>The re-activating nature Varicella Zoster Virus ( VZV ) may allow life long boost use vaccine vector conjunction HIV generate durable immunity systemically mucosa . This study aim characterize mucosal immunity vaccination commercial live-attenuated varicella-zoster virus vaccine respect immune activation state , mucosal home property VZV-specific effector immune responses healthy woman low risk HIV acquisition .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Describe Immune Responses Healthy Women Following Immunization With Varicella Zoster Virus Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An ideal HIV vaccine able induce effector specific immune response mucosal site serve portal HIV entry . The use persistent replicate viral vector Varicella-Zoster Virus ( VZV ) great potential assemble specific response . Live-attenuated varicella-zoster virus use vaccine worldwide 25 year well-described safety profile . However , immunogenicity data African population lacking . The general objective study measure magnitude kinetics effector immune response immune activation induce live-attenuated varicella-zoster virus vaccine population Kenyan woman . Specifically , study measure immune activation cervical rectal mucosa context VZV-effector response vaccination compare observe immune activation mucosal tissue blood . A total 44 healthy woman Nairobi , age 18-50 year recruit study , obtain write informed consent . Eligibility participate study depend result laboratory test , review medical history , physical examination answer question HIV risk behaviour . The study ass immune response immediate delay administration live-attenuated virus varicella-zoster vaccine VZV-seropositive individual . Participants randomly divide 2 group . Group 1 receive single dose vaccine day 0 Group 2 day 84 . The participant follow period 9-12 month receive vaccine .</detailed_description>
