	<brief_summary>Some genetic polymorphism know interfere ARV metabolism therefore likely explain inter-individual variation ( efficacy , toxicity , resistance ) observe ART . The common form human DNA variation consist change base nucleotide sequence individual give position , single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) . Therefore , purpose research identification characterization clinical impact several SNPs gene cod transport protein ( e.g.ABCB1 , ABCC1 ) biotransformation enzyme ( e.g.CYP3A4 , CYP2B6 ) know involve pharmacokinetic pathway select ARV drug therapeutic response difficult predict . Aside , influence SNPs response treatment ( CD4+cell , viral load ) toxicity evaluate . Plasma concentration ARV drug correlate therapeutic efficacy also risk toxicity virological failure , basis therapeutic drug monitoring . However , give intracellular location HIV , analyze intracellular drug concentration fundamental investigator also focus new topic .</brief_summary>
