	<brief_summary>Background : KOOS self -administered instrument ass patient 's opinion Knee associate problem . For available English &amp; various language &amp; complete instrument . In India translate Hindi far . However , province country unique language . Maharashtra second large state India Marathi regional language communication . Since KOOS self‐report measure , translation local language think necessary . This disease specific measure originally design English speak region employ non-English population need translate unique method achieve normative equivalence linguistic validation . Methods : After take permission KOOS web manager T1 , T2 , T12 , B1 &amp; B2 version format accord guideline lay AAOS cross cultural adaptation health status measure . T12 version send field test . Total 32 subject meet eligibility criterion Included study . Results : Statistical analysis reliability test re‐test method suggest Perfect correlation ( r =1 ) day 1 &amp; 2 . A range 0.83‐0.54 co‐relation co‐efficient ( r ) demonstrate validity KOOS subscales compare 8 different domain SF‐36 . All correlation statistically highly significant . Sport recreation subscale many miss response since many item subscale appropriate Maharashtrian cultural set-up . Participants additionally provide information functional activity difficult execute due knee associate pain disability . Conclusion : Marathi version KOOS prove reliable &amp; valid measure . Future scope : study demonstrate need undertake cross cultural adaptation since constant pattern impairment reveal execution daily activity sit floor attend certain yoga posture etc . Key word : linguistic validation , disease specific self-report , KOOS , Marathi translation , quality life .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Translation &amp; Linguistic Validation Knee Osteoarthritis Outcome Score ( KOOS ) Questionnaire Marathi Language</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Disability index use Outcome measure diagnostic tool prognostic tool . This index allow healthcare professional measure impact psycho-social physical factor functional performance , ability patient . The people suffer osteoarthritis determine interplay psychosocial , physical physiological neuromuscular factor Quadriceps strength , knee pain , age . These component show important determinant functional impairment elderly subject severity knee osteoarthritis assess radiographically.Disability index design measure influence factor functional outcome hence use clinically justify treatment capture meaningful recovery . The disease specific measure design ass specific diagnostic group specific population goal detect clinical change intervention know efficacy good reliability , validity , responsiveness , low burden administration clinically useful . Such measure standardize patient- center administer low cost . Hence questionnaire develop assess short- long-term patient-relevant outcome follow knee injury form Knee Injury Osteoarthritis Outcome Score ( KOOS ) . This self-administered ass five outcome : Pain , Symptoms , Activities Daily Living , Sport Recreation Function , Knee-Related Quality Of Life . The KOOS meet basic criterion outcome measure use evaluate course knee injury treatment outcome . KOOS use reliable valid measure use evaluate effectiveness intervention knee osteoarthritis , total knee replacement anterior cruciate ligament cartilage injury . It convert various regional language . KOOS translate national language India ie . Hindi . However , many province India primary language communication varies . In multi-linguistic country language shift happen every province concordant diversified culture . Maharashtra second large state India estimate population 117 million appx . primary language communication Marathi 70 % population communicate regional language . A need translational cross cultural adaptation emphasize effective reasonable measurement responses self-report measure whenever wherever applicable . This true especially self-report measure originally design English speak region employ non-English population . It difficult achieve normative equivalence dependent openness stranger , political opinion , tendency conform assert oneself , since culture differ willing share personal information . On hand information relevant semantic conceptual equivalence demographic question across language , extract less difficulty since word idea general commonly use . This emphasize need translate health status self-administered measure use new country . It recognize unique method use achieve linguistic validation reach equivalence original source target language measure instrument . A published report ISPOR suggest consensus follow Principles Good Practice translation cultural adaptation self-report questionnaire . A guideline evolve adaptation process available form template . Adaptation process design attain semantic , idiomatic , experiential , conceptual equivalence source target questionnaire Since KOOS self-administered instrument , translation local language think necessary majority population attend physiotherapy clinic communicate Marathi . Unavailability Marathi version KOOS hence , pose difficulty functional evaluation population day day basis treatment . Hence , exist need provide valid reliable Marathi version KOOS , facilitate well understanding functional evaluation finding population suffer knee osteoarthritis . This study aim translate check psychometric property translate version KOOS per guideline lay AAOS . Objective study provide valid reliable instrument regional language intend evaluate disease specific functional problem Marathi speak population . Methods : Study design : cross section survey design- validation study . Permission obtain Institutional local ethic committee . This study carry 2 phase . Phase I consist translation English version KOOS Marathi version . Second phase consist field test translated version check test-retest reliability validity .</detailed_description>
