	<brief_title>Usefulness Ultrasonography Versus Non-contrast Magnetic Resonance Imaging Surveillance Hepatocellular Carcinoma ( MIRACLE-HCC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) one major complication patient chronic liver disease . The prognosis HCC rely extent disease time diagnosis . Hence detect cancer earlier stage , regular surveillance test important subject high risk develop cancer . Current guideline recommend regular surveillance use ultrasonography 6 month-interval . Ultrasonography non-invasive safe procedure , yet limited skill operator often difficult differentiate cancer regenerate nodule especially atrophy cirrhotic liver . According recent meta-analysis , overall sensitivity specificity detect liver cancer use ultrasonography 90 % , however sensitivity decrease 60 % detect early lesion surgery liver transplantation indicate . Of note , addition AFP ultrasonography also fail increase sensitivity detect small cancer . Taken together , need develop new surveillance test improve sensitivity specificity . Recently , retrospective study report CT MRI show good sensitivity ultrasonography detect early liver cancer . However , perform CT surveillance test limit frequent exposure radiation contrast-dye agent . Although MRI risk radiation-exposure , limited high cost . On contrast , non-contrast MRI offer cost comparable US absence exposure radiation contrast-dye agent , suggest non-contrast MRI good alternative surveillance tool early detection HCC . Therefore , prospective , randomized trial , investigator investigate usefulness ultrasonography versus non-contrast magnetic resonance image surveillance hepatocellular carcinoma .</detailed_description>
