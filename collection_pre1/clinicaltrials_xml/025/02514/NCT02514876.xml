	<mesh_term>Atrial Fibrillation</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Patient least 18 year old . Patient undergo atrial fibrillation ablation procedure . Patient transesophageal echocardiogram ( TEE ) within 48 hour prior ablation procedure rule leave atrial thrombus . Patient provide informed , write consent participation study . Patients placement ICE catheter right atrium adequate atrial visualization technically feasible ( evaluate determine physician perform procedure ) . Patients transseptal puncture relatively contraindicated . Patients leave atrial clot dense spontaneous contrast identified TEE , would increase thromboembolic risk . Women child bear potential , pregnancy exclude . Patients unable grant inform , write consent participation study .</criteria>
