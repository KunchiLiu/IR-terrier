	<detailed_description>Antithrombotic therapy effective prevention cardiovascular ( CV ) event cause bleed . Emerging evidence indicate extra-cranial bleeding important myocardial infarction marker risk subsequent non-fatal fatal CV event , issue prospectively study . If association bleed CV event causal , prevention bleeding , target risk factor , prevention complication bleeding , target causal pathway , could substantially reduce burden bleeding-related CV event . Progress develop approach limit knowledge gap . Known risk factor fully explain bleed risk investigator understand mechanism link bleed adverse outcome whether association causal . One-half bleeds lead CV event patient receive antithrombotic therapy arise GI tract . INTERBLEED- Pilot Hamilton Ontario plan explore risk factor GI bleeding , outcomes GI bleeding , well-circumscribed important group use case-control design prospective 3 month 12 month follow-up . Specific objective : ( 1 ) identify risk factor GI bleed estimate population attributable risk ; ( 2 ) determine risk non-fatal fatal CV event functional outcome GI bleeding ; ( 3 ) explore possible mechanism link GI bleed CV outcome 300 case-control pair 4 centre Hamilton , Ontario Canada recruit 24-month period . Data collect patient characteristic , medical history , case , work-up , management outcomes bleed . Data INTERBLEED-Pilot Hamilton Ontario inform design large study ultimately help develop new approach reduce burden bleeding-related CV event .</detailed_description>
