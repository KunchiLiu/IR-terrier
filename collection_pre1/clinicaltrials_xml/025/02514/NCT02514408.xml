	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study impact radical cystectomy ( surgery ) expulsion ( release ) circulate tumor cell blood stream patient bladder cancer . Significant surgery radical cystectomy may cause expulsion tumor cell . Studying release tumor cell circulation may help doctor understand impact radical cystectomy tumor metastasis and/or tumor recurrence .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To detect number circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) follow radical cystectomy peripheral central line . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To ensure safety use femoral vein access central venous blood supply patient primary bladder cancer withdrawal blood peripheral central line . OUTLINE : Patients undergo placement central line via right femoral vein undergo open radical cystectomy ( ORC ) . Blood sample collect analyzed CTCs pre-surgery , 30 minute 1 hour ORC begin , post-surgery , 7 day surgery . After completion study , patient follow 2 week 1 month .</detailed_description>
