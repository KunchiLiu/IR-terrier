	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess effectiveness Stimwave Spinal Cord Stimulator ( SCS ) System treatment chronic pain utilizing high frequency ( 10,000 Hz ) waveforms comparison traditional stimulation setting .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Wireless High Frequency Spinal Cord Stimulation Chronic Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-center , prospective , randomize study subject receive Freedom SCS System randomize 1:1 receive either HF ( 10,000 Hz ) LF ( 5 Hz 1500 Hz ) stimulation parameter . Enrollment continue 80 responder end trial identify . A description Freedom SCS System find Appendix A . Subjects chronic back back leg pain refractory standard medical treatment associate Failed Back Surgery Syndrome ( FBSS ) . Subjects randomize either test ( high frequency ) control ( low frequency ) group 6-month period maximum one-month trial period . At end 6 month follow-up , subject assess outcomes appoint therapy continue long-term use system . Stimulators place follow site target painful area : - High Frequency ( HF ) Group : Epidural Space midline cover vertebra level T8 T11 ( one stimulator place top T8 second stimulator place middle T9 ) . - Low Frequency ( LF ) Group : Epidural Space cover vertebrae level determine paresthesia mapping painful area .</detailed_description>
