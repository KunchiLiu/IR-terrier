	<brief_summary>Background : - Chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) and/or small lymphocytic lymphoma ( SLL ) tumor abnormal B cell often affect elderly patient . Studies identify critical factor require growth CLL cell . First , CLL cell survive receive signal B-cell receptor . Second , CLL cell benefit interaction cell , especially T cell . - Survival signal B-cell receptor reduce ibrutinib , pill take daily mouth . Ibrutinib approve U.S. Food Drug Administration treat CLL patient . - T cell interact CLL cell remove fludarabine , drug give vein widely use treat CLL . By add short course fludarabine , hope complement action ibrutinib restore healthier immune system . Objectives : - To determine ibrutinib short course fludarabine use safely effectively treat CLL SLL . Eligibility : - Diagnosed CLL SLL require treatment - No prior treatment CLL SLL - Age great equal 18 year - Not pregnant breast-feeding woman - Adequate kidney liver function Study Design : - This phase II study 32 patient . - Participants screen blood test physical exam eligibility . - Eligible participant treat ibrutinib short course fludarabine ; - Treatment give cycle . Each cycle define 28 day . Treatment continue long effective safe participant . - Ibrutinib take mouth start first day cycle 1 . Ibrutinib continue daily . - Fludarabine give vein first five day cycle 3 4 . Each infusion take approximately 30 minute . - Participants also take drug prevent infection complication . - Participants treatment clinic visit test include : - Medical history - Physical exam - Blood urine test - CT PET scan : They lie machine use computer take serial image body . - For PET scan , radioactive sugar inject vein clear visualization body . - EKG : To assess heart rhythm . - Bone marrow lymph node biopsy - Participants avoid grapefruit , Seville oranges , grapefruit juice study . They also avoid live vaccine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II Study Using Ibrutinib Short-Course Fludarabine Previously Untreated Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma ( CLL/SLL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) and/or small lymphocytic lymphoma ( SLL ) tumor B cell often affect elderly patient . While cause CLL still unclear , study indicate critical factor require tumor cell . First , CLL cell grow survive receive signal B-cell receptor ( BCR ) ; second , CLL cell benefit interaction cell , especially T cell . The stimulation BCR reduce ibrutinib , oral drug selectively inhibit Bruton tyrosine kinase ( BTK ) . In clinical trial , ibrutinib demonstrate safety high response rate patient high-risk disease . Ibrutinib gain FDA approval treatment CLL patient 17p deletion least one prior therapy . However , single-agent ibrutinib limitation ; drug eliminate tumor cell , time , tumor cell may become resistant . Therefore , combination ibrutinib drug could beneficial . Here chose fludarabine well-tolerated drug use widely treat CLL . Also , fludarabine kill malignant B cell T cell support growth leukemia cell . With approach hope restore healthier immune system . This study investigate safety efficacy ibrutinib combine fludarabine . This protocol intend previously untreated CLL patient . Ibrutinib give daily disease progression intolerable side effect occur . Fludarabine give cycle 3 4 .</detailed_description>
