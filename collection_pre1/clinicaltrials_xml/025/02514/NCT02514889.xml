	<brief_summary>Investigators University California-Los Angeles ( UCLA ) The Children 's Clinic Long Beach ( TCC ) conduct randomize , control comparative effectiveness trial two government-sanctioned behavior change approach weight control TCC 's obese patient . The first approach calorie-counting calorie restriction ( CC ) approach use Diabetes Prevention Program . The second approach high-satiation/high-satiety approach represent MyPlate.gov . The MyPlate nutritional goal double patient fruit vegetable intake , legume intake , whole grain intake . Both condition stipulate 150 minute moderate physical activity week . Study participants 300 TCC 's obese patient , 75 % expect Latino , 15 % African American 10 % Other Ethnicities . The intervention implement trained community lifestyle change coach brief support clinician . The intervention include two home visit , two group education session seven telephone behavior change coaching session . Compared CC approach , MyPlate approach hypothesize yield well 12 month patient-centered outcome , particularly self-reported satiety .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Is MyPlate Approach Helping Overweight Patients Lose Weight More Patient-centered ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The traditional government advice weight loss obese patient calorie-counting ( CC ) / portion control . In 2011 government begin recommend MyPlate approach ( MyP ) optimal nutrition well weight control . The CC condition ask obese patient reduce daily calorie intake less recommended calorie target . The MyP approach also limit daily calorie emphasize eat MORE high-satiation food make ½ daily food choice fruit vegetable , ¼ daily food choice whole grain . The relative patient-centered outcome effectiveness MyP approach versus CC approach yet test clinic patient . Specific Aims : In partnership local community clinic , investigator conduct randomize control trial ( RCT ) compare patient-centeredness efficacy usual care compare two government-supported lifestyle change approach reduce patient obesity risk . Study participants 300 obese , low income , mostly Latino African American adult patient staff associate community health center Long Beach , California . The intervention implement trained community lifestyle change coach brief support clinician . The first weight loss approach calorie-counting ( CC ) , portion-cutting approach recommend www.nutrition.gov . The second fill-up-sooner-on-fewer-calories approach find http : //www.choosemyplate.gov ( MyP ) . The CC condition asks overweight patient reduce daily calorie intake less recommended calorie target . The MyP approach also limit daily calorie emphasize eat MORE high-satiation food make ½ daily food choice fruit vegetable , ¼ daily food choice whole grain . MyP use progressive goal-setting facilitate double usual fruit vegetable intake . To facilitate adherence , MyP approach also include home environment change make healthy choice easy choice . All condition encourage least 150 minute moderate vigorous physical activity week . Primary patient-centered outcome include self-reported satiety , health-related quality life , self-efficacy eat fruit vegetable , patient autonomy , patient satisfaction , hypothesize favor MyP condition 12 month follow-up relative CC condition . The primary medical outcome reduction body weight . Specific Aims Aim # 1 . Use qualitative information patient clinical staff revise intervention material procedure . Aim # 2 . Use result pilot test intervention condition revise intervention material procedure . Aim # 3 . Conduct 1-year RCT involve two home visit , two group education class , seven telephone support/ lifestyle change coach call . Aim # 4 . Obtain qualitative data provider coach ; combine participant data ass intervention feasibility , acceptability perceive usefulness . Aim # 5 . Disseminate result recommendation community group public health professional . Primary patient-centered hypothesis : Compared CC approach , MyP approach yield well 1-year outcome self-reported satiety systolic blood pressure . Both government-recommended condition yield significant similar 12 month decline body weight . The MyPlate distillation 2010 Dietary Guidelines Americans shift emphasis nutrition recommendation desirable weight loss count calorie maximize satiation , practical step eat MORE fruit vegetable , MORE whole grain , MORE nonfat dairy , MORE water ( LESS sugary beverage ) . Calorie counting help lose excess weight short term rarely able sustain desirable weight loss long-term . The MyPlate approach may easier sustain allows eat 25 percent gram food even reduce baseline calorie intake 10 percent ; extra daily gram food help patient feel full even lose weight . Because MyPlate distillation recommendation healthy Americans , regardless body size , guide eat choice everyone family lifetime . If MyPlate approach show effective help patient sustain long-term weight loss , clinician expect actively engage obese patient weight loss effort .</detailed_description>
