	<brief_title>Resection Nerve Plexus Right Half Celiac SMA Associated With Extended Pancreatoduodenectomy Surgical Treatment Adenocarcinoma Head Pancreas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lymph node metastasis nerve invasion characteristic pancreatic cancer . For pancreatic head cancer , celiac SMA nerve plexus often involve . Many surgeon start improve surgical approach pancreatoduodenectomy extend extent surgical resection include extend lymph node dissection nerve plexus clearance hope achieve good long-term survival rate . Postoperative complication diarrhea malnutrition report celiac SMA nerve plexus resection pancreatoduodenectomy . As result , resection nerve plexus right half celiac SMA associate extended pancreatoduodenectomy recommend . This study perform confirm whether resection nerve plexus right half celiac SMA associate extended pancreatoduodenectomy could improve survival relieve pain pancreatic cancer patient . Subjects undergo surgery randomize extended pancreatoduodenectomy resection nerve plexus right half celiac SMA versus standard pancreatoduodenectomy . Subjects follow every two month survivorship death ass pain , quality life measure , narcotic pain control usage . The primary endpoint overall survival secondary endpoint disease-specific free survival determine two year post surgery .</detailed_description>
