	<brief_title>Multi-center Clinical Study Evaluate C2 CryoBalloon Focal Ablation System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Coldplay 3 multi-center , prospective study provide evidence efficacy safety System treatment patient previously untreated ( treatment naïve ) low grade dysplasia ( LGD ) high grade dysplasia ( HGD ) BE . Subjects may maximum five ( 5 ) ablation treatment session 12 month study participation achieve complete eradication dysplastic BE intestinal metaplasia . As many ablation need treat dysplastic area allow treatment session discretion investigator .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Low highgrade nonnodular , previously untreated ( `` treatment naïve '' ) dysplastic BE , confirm histopathological analysis . If nodular BE Intramuscosal Cancer ( ImCA ) identify patient screening , may treat Endoscopic Mucosal Resection ( EMR ) ≥6 week prior treatment protocol . If previous EMR perform , followup endoscopy must negative nodular BE . Patients ImCA must low risk recurrence , confirm EMR pathology result negative positive margin , poorly differentiate carcinoma , lymphovascular invasion . BE length ≤6cm exclude visible BE island , Prague Classification C ≥0 / M ≥1 Older 18 year age time consent Operable per institution 's standard Provides write informed consent approve informed consent form Willing able comply study requirement followup Nondysplastic indefinite dysplasia BE , confirm histopathological analysis Esophageal stenosis/stricture prevent advancement therapeutic endoscope ( patient may stenosis/stricture dilate treated CryoBalloon ablation protocol subsequent procedure ≥2 week later ) Symptomatic untreated stricture Endoscopicallyvisualized abnormality mass nodule within 4cm treatment zone . Neoplastic nodule must first treat EMR ≥6 week prior plan treatment protocol .
