	<brief_summary>Paracetamol 's solubility achieve add excipient sodium salt , either bicarbonate , carbonate citrate . As relationship salt hypertension well know , due sodium content raise hypothesis may interfere control risk factor . Therefore , objective study evaluate effect blood pressure effervescent paracetamol compare non-effervescent , hypertensive patient . This multicenter , randomize , control , crossover , open , phase IV clinical trial , compare effect two different formulation paracetamol ( effervescent non-effervescent tablet ) blood pressure hypertensive patient 3 week treatment ( cod EUDRACT 2010-023485-53 ) . The washing time two period approximately 1 week ( minimum 3 day )</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Inclusion criterion : Patients include study must meet following criterion : - hypertensive patient 18 year - degenerative joint disease - regularly need analgesic treatment . They must submit BP consultation lower 150 95 mmHg low 135 85 mmHg associate cardiovascular disease ( stroke , coronary heart disease , peripheral arterial disease ) diabetes mellitus . They ca n't receive pharmacological antihypertensive treatment , must stable unchanged last month . In relation osteoarticular disease , degree mild moderate pain , score 1 4 visual analog scale ( VAS ) Evaluation result Primary endpoint : The primary endpoint change mean daytime , night-time ( sleep ) 24-hour systolic BP , measure ABPM , baseline 3 week treatment period . Secondary endpoint : - Changes systolic BP measure clinic end 3-week follow-up respect baseline period . - 24-hour , daytime night-time ( sleep ) diastolic BP measure ABPM : change baseline 3 week treatment period - Changes diastolic BP measure clinic end 3-week follow-up respect baseline period . - Percentage patient maintain clinical BP 140 90 mmHg end period - Degree pain assess visual analog scale - Consumption rescue medication - Therapeutic compliance</detailed_description>
