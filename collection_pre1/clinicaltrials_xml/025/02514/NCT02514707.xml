	<brief_title>Outcomes HIV Infected Individuals After Ten Years Antiretroviral Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . INTRODUCTION : 1.1 . Disease Setting/Patient Population : Advances HIV antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) dramatically reduce mortality HIV , primarily reduction death attributable AIDS defining condition person receive state-of-the-art ART may expect live 25 year potentially longer . However number death attributable cause conventionally consider HIV relate increase 50 % patient HIV die cause consider unrelated HIV . Thus , management HIV involve treatment chronic disease possibility near normal life expectancy , often multiple co morbidity . 1.2 . Background Rationale : Cardiovascular risk patient ART Metabolic complication , include dyslipidemia , insulin resistance , alter fat distribution ( loss subcutaneous fat relative increase central fat ) , common adult infected HIV receive ART . These complication may increase patient ' risk cardiovascular disease . Recent study suggest type ART may associate increase risk cardiovascular disease , cause concern give people live HIV may take ART decade . The mechanisms causing increase risk cardiovascular disease unclear , suggest may relate dyslipidemia , insulin resistance , diabetes mellitus , inflammation , impaired fibrinolysis , factor specific antiretroviral medication , combination factor . Grinspoon Carr speculate HIV ART might associate many risk factor . From observational data evidence link ART cardiovascular disease point specifically PIs class since may promote formation atherosclerotic lesion , NRTI specific agent ( abacavir , didanosine ) . However date role abacavir remain controversial . All potential cardiovascular risk factor , include dyslipidemia , insulin resistance , hypertension , smoking , sedentary lifestyle , weight , family history , assess . Ideally glucose level fast lipid level check annually HIV patient ART . Renal disease The use combination , highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) since mid-1990s result significant sustained reduction morbidity mortality HIV infection , include significant decline HIV-associated nephropathy ( HIVAN ) . At time , however , variety ART-related renal side effect note , include proteinuria renal tubular damage , interstitial nephritis , nephrolithiasis , overall decline glomerular filtration rate . Kidney function estimate abnormal 30 % HIV-infected patient . In addition , metabolic complication type 2 diabetes hypertension may also contribute renal dysfunction time . In Sub- Saharan Africa , include Uganda , tenofovir include one recommend drug first line regimen , due comparable efficacy first-line regimen contain stavudine , zidovudine abacavir , additional advantage low toxicity availability once-daily , fixed-dose generic formulation . Yet concern regard renal tubular toxicity remain especially use resource-limited setting clinical detection renal impairment difficult . Early stage renal dysfunction assess laboratory monitoring creatinine glomerular filtration rate . Current guideline contraindicate TDF use creatinine clearance ( CrCl ) fall 50 ml/min unless dose reduction make . If TDF implement resource-limited setting number require antiretroviral therapy high access laboratory service scarce , monitoring protocol may need simplify . Ideally order monitor patient renal toxicity , It recommend urinalysis proteinuria perform routinely creatinine clearance calculate ; co morbidity may contribute elevate risk kidney disease also closely monitor . Data DART trial , prospective randomize clinical trial conduct African setting , show low ( 1.3 % ) rate severe renal impairment 96 week , difference TDF-containing non TDF-containing regimen . Similarly data routine program setting ( Lesotho ) show renal toxicity due tenofovir rare mild . Late mortality : A multicenter cohort study Europe North America report already 4 year ART cumulative incidence non-AIDS-related death exceed AIDS-related death . The frequent non-AIDS cause death non-AIDS malignancy ( 11.8 % ) , non-AIDS infection ( 8.2 % ) , cardiovascular disease ( 7.9 % , 40 % myocardial infarction/ischemic heart disease 18 % stroke ) , violence ( 7.8 % , include suicide , substance abuse , homicide/accident/unspecified ) , liver disease ( 7.1 % , 55.8 % hepatitis relate ) . The frequent sit non-AIDS malignancy respiratory tract intrathoracic organ ( 36.7 % ) ; digestive organ peritoneum ( 28.7 % ) ; lip , oral cavity , pharynx ( 6.0 % ) ; skin ( 4.7 % ) . Rationale study : Little information available patient ART long term period Sub-Saharan Africa . Particularly information available long term complication ART non HIV related event . Although data available resource rich setting , information may applicable Sub-Saharan Africa due different antiretroviral treatment drug use ART monitoring strategy , different HIV subtypes , well different ethnicity endemic disease .</detailed_description>
