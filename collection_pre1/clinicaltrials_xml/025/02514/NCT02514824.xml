	<brief_title>MLN0128 Recurrent/Metastatic Merkel Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase I/II clinical trial . A phase I clinical trial test safety investigational intervention also try define appropriate dose investigational intervention use study . `` Investigational '' mean intervention study . The FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve MLN0128 treatment disease . MLN0128 may prevent tumor cell divide grow selectively potently inhibit chemical , mTOR kinase , regulate cell growth survival . Patients merkel cell carcinoma observe sometimes carry genetic alteration tumor cell may make cancer sensitive inhibition MLN0128 . In research study , investigator study usefulness MLN0128 merkel cell carcinoma case .</detailed_description>
