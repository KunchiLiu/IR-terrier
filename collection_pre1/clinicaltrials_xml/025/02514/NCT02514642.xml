	<detailed_description>Ticagrelor oral , reversibly-binding , direct-acting P2Y12 receptor antagonist use clinically prevention atherothrombotic event patient acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) . Guideline recommendation use dual antiplatelet therapy ( DAPT ) formulate ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily plus aspirin preference clopidogrel 75mg daily plus aspirin patient ACS without ST-segment elevation . However , East Asian patient ( East Asian descent ) include trial ass use drug . In addition , grow body data support East Asian might different adverse event profile ( thrombophilia bleed ) `` therapeutic window '' compare white subject . Furthermore , `` East Asian paradox '' phenomenon also describe East Asian patient higher prevalence platelet reactivity DAPT , ischaemic event rate follow percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) ACS similar even low white patient . In Korea Japan , report low dos ticagrelor might potent inhibition platelet aggregation ( IPA ) clopidogrel ( 75 mg daily ) healthy subject patient stable coronary artery disease , respectively . But still clear whether low dose ticagrelor superior clopidogrel large population Chinese ACS patient .
