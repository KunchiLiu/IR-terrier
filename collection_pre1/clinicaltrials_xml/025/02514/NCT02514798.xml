	<brief_summary>Patients affect severe parenchymal pulmonary disease , Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) , may experience dyspnea rest due increase work breathing reduce oxygenation . The delivery high-flow humidify nasal oxygen ( HFNC ) show positive-end-expiratory pressure ( PEEP ) effect able flush CO2 upper airways , reduce dead space ventilation . Furthermore proven reduce respiratory rate shortly initiation . These multiple action offer potential change respiratory pattern reduce work breathing , improve efficiency breathe . In short-term , physiological , open , randomize , cross-over pilot study investigator swill describe effect vary setting high-flow nasal oxygen respiratory rate , tidal volume , diaphragmatic work breathe patient severe COPD . The investigator also describe change gas exchange effect subject ' comfort dyspnea breathe response vary set CPAP subject population .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Physiological Effect High-Flow Nasal Cannula Respiratory Pattern Work Breathing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HFNC show many advantage treatment acutely hypoxemic patient , improve clinical outcome . The exact mechanism underlie beneficial effect still completely understood . Few study analyze effect HFNC ventilatory pattern work breathing . The majority study focus effect healthy volunteer . Only one study Braunlich et al . studied effect HFNC COPD interstitial lung disease ( ILD ) patient , show high-flow nasal oxygen reduces respiratory rate increase tidal volume patient . In adult , low flow range 5 10 L/min comparable flow receive standard oxygen device ( nasal cannula facial mask ) . Patients underlie pulmonary disease , study population , high inspiratory flow demand range ( 30 120 L/min acute respiratory failure episode ) compare healthy subject . We expect observe physiological change outcome propose Optiflow ™ setting minimal therapeutic flow 30 L/min , intermediate 45 L/min , maximal flow rate 60 L/min . There extensive clinical experience use high flow rate range generally well tolerate . As mentioned , HFNC generate Positive End Expiratory Pressure ( PEEP ) comparable CPAP range 4 - 8 cmH2O ( minimal maximal PEEP generate HFNC ) . Future study , base pilot study , differ previous one follow way : 1 . We test different technology . The Optiflow delivers substantially high flow rate previous Braunlich study13.That study use single flow rate 24 L/min whereas examine range flow extend considerably high ( 30 60L/min ) . We interested determine effect higher flow rate compare range use Braunlich study , able compare device directly latter device available US . It important understand whether efficacy advantage use high flow rate available Optiflow . 2 . Future study aim understand mechanism effect high flow nasal oxygen . 1 . Are effect anticipate see relate change inspiratory muscle effort determine measurement transdiaphragmatic pressure calculation pressure time product diaphragm ? 2 . Or flush dead space nasopharynx improve ventilatory efficiency gas exchange remain stable even improve ( determine measurement minute volume transcutaneous PCO2 ( PtcCO2 ) ? This implication use HFNC treat patient COPD exacerbation develop respiratory muscle fatigue . 1 ) Our focus COPD patient use HFNC study much date . Most study focus patient hypoxemic respiratory failure . It important understand HFNC affect breathe pattern gas exchange COPD patient earlier report suggest excessive concentration oxygen administer COPD patient retain CO2 actually worsen CO2 retention blunt respiratory drive . The reduction respiratory rate minute volume note Braunlich et al could represent blunt effect O2 drive breathe could promote great CO2 retention . By monitor PCO2 , something Braunlich study n't , assess possibility . 2 ) We wish evaluate effect CPAP breathing index HFNC COPD patient . We plan use CPAP response `` positive control '' , determine population responds describe CPAP study literature . Prior study demonstrate patient severe COPD , use CPAP range proposing , lower diaphragmatic work breathe wish determine population manifest similar effect . Thus future study , base data obtain pilot study , extend Braunlich et al study evaluate effect higher flow rate use different technology available US , determine effect inspiratory muscle effort , monitor gas exchange important mechanistic safety perspective . We hypothesize high flow rate great blunt effect breathe pattern low flow rate improvement ventilator efficiency associate decrease breathe work diaphragm .</detailed_description>
