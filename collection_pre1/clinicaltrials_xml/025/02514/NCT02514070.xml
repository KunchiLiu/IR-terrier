	<brief_summary>Background : - Metabolism body turn food energy . Omega-3 fatty acid substance find food cold-water fish shellfish essential good health . Researchers want see effect two fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) metabolism . They may beneficial cardiovascular health . Objective : - To understand effect EPA DHA metabolism . Eligibility : - Healthy people age 18 year plasma triglyceride ( type fat blood ) level 100 mg/dL high Design : - The study last 20 24 week . - Participants 4 visit NIH Clinical Center . These include : - Medical history - Physical Fasting blood urine test - CAVI test : blood pressure take arm legs , heart monitor . - Participants take EPA/DHA dietary supplement . They take 4 gel capsule , 3 time day , 6 7 week . Then take capsule 8 10 week ( wash-out period ) . They take capsule 6 7 week . - Participants keep food journal .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison EPA DHA-Rich Fish Oils Lipoprotein Metabolism In Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This novel randomize crossover , double-blinded pilot study aim investigate effect different omega-3 fatty acid , namely EPA DHA , lipoprotein metabolism . Subjects unblinded performance measurement complete study . Subjects receive EPA DHA supplement approximately 6 week wash period 8 week two arm study . The study consist 4 outpatient visit laboratory research sample CAVI test perform . A 7-day food diary , pill count , red cell membrane n-3 level monitor assess compliance . Serum cholesterol transport lipoprotein , VLDL , LDL HDL , vary relationship cardiovascular risk . LDL proatherogenic , whereas HDL cardio-protective . Fish oil supplementation , EPA DHA , show reduce triglyceride . EPA supplementation also show low LDL-C , whereas DHA raise LDL-C HDL-C . These differential effect lipoprotein may alter cardiovascular protection afford fish oil supplementation . This study test hypothesis EPA DHA may differ LDL-C lower ability difference modulate plasma PCSK9 level , major determinant LDL-C level . In addition , ass parameter related lipoprotein composition function may impact cardioprotective effect EPA DHA . Other report beneficial effect omega-3 fatty acid supplementation , decrease platelet coaguability , marker inflammation change guy microbiota , also monitor .</detailed_description>
