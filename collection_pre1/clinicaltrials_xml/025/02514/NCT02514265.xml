	<brief_title>Trans-MAPP Symptom Patterns Study ( SPS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To good understand etiology treated natural history UCPPS , identify clinical factor research measurement define clinically relevant sub-groups patient future clinical trial , inform symptom management , NIDDK establish Multidisciplinary Approach Study Chronic Pelvic Pain ( MAPP ) Research Network 20089 ( http : //www.mappnetwork.org/ ) . The primary clinical research effort carry network Phase I prospective cohort study , Trans-MAPP Epidemiology/Phenotyping ( EP ) Study.10 From 12/14/2009 12/14/2012 1,039 men woman enrol , include person UCPPS ( n=424 ) ; person co-morbid illness , include fibromyalgia , irritable bowel syndrome , chronic fatigue syndrome ( n=200 condition ) ; healthy control ( n=415 ) . Study participant extensively characterize ( i.e. , phenotyped ) baseline , UCPPS participant follow 12 month . During follow-up , use web-based symptom data capture system , small battery self-report questionnaire repeat bi-weekly schedule 48 week . In addition , neuroimaging perform subset participant ( n=279 ) baseline , biological sample collect participant baseline follow-up study identify plasma urine biomarkers potential infectious agent . This study complement number Discovery Site-Specific clinical research study ( i.e. , study generally conduct single site ) investigation animal model develop multiple site mimic symptom human UCPPS . Initial analysis data identify number provocative finding . There strong indication certain subgroup participant ( albeit small sample size ) urinary non-urinary symptom tend improve time ; whereas subgroup tend worsen time . These pattern improve worsen differentially express accord sex , subtype bladder pain syndrome ( BPS ) , pain location ( localize pelvic region v pain report pelvic region beyond ) . The second phase MAPP Network design conduct prospective , observational study men woman UCPPS , refer Symptom Patterns Study ( SPS ) . This follow-up study pre-defined subgroup , long follow-up , order investigate clinical biologic factor associate worsen and/or improvement report urinary non-urinary symptom . This propose MAPP Phase II SPS also present opportunity apply many promise research method pain field ( e.g . functional , chemical structural neuroimaging , quantitative sensory test ) course study ( baseline longitudinally ) well characterize men woman UCPPS . Most measure collect single point time Trans-MAPP Epidemiology/Phenotyping Study Phase I , within sample UCPPS patient enrich predefined subgroup . Further phenotyping second phase study allow u good determine measure , measure identify Phase I ( e.g. , urinary serum biomarkers ) , might identify individual likely spontaneous improvement symptom , versus transition `` peripheral '' ( pelvic pain ) `` centralize '' form ( pelvic pain beyond ) urinary non-urinary pain . Eligible participant ask participate study 36 month . During ask complete series in-clinic study visit various time point neuroimaging scan quantitative sensory test , online internet-based questionnaire clinic site/at home ( assess symptom , health care utilization , flare status , quality life ) , physical exam , pelvic exam , prostate massage ( optional male ) .</detailed_description>

Participant receive clinical diagnosis either IC/BPS CP/CPPS ( per AUA guideline ) clinician familiar UCPPS criterion confirm participant meet UCPPS evaluation criterion perprotocol . Any patient meeting one follow criterion eligible enrollment Symptom Patterns Study . However , participant develop exclusion criterion followup phase study continue follow . It record followup data patient develop exclusion criterion . 1 . Participant ongoing symptomatic urethral stricture . 2 .
