	<brief_summary>Therapeutic plasma exchange ( TPE ) establish treatment modality acute removal pathophysiological relevant mediator various disease . Adipokines recently find play important role variety immunologic disease . However , many disease state cardiac inflammatory involvement common biomarkers routinely use diagnosis assessment therapeutic success . The effect TPE biomarkers use clinical routine investigate . The aim study determine adipokine cardiac biomarker removal TPE therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Elimination Cardiac Inflammatory Biomarkers Adipokines Therapeutic Plasma Exchange</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We perform observational prospective single-centered study . Every patient receive two consecutive therapeutic plasma exchange ( TPE ) session study . Plasma exchange therapy perform use either Spectra Optia® Octo Nova® apheresis system . Anticoagulation apply either heparin citrate . The prescribe dose exchange volume every TPE treatment 1.1-times individual calculate total plasma volume , use Nadler-Allen equation . A substitute fluid 5 % albumin concentration use every treatment . Blood sample measurement different adipokines ( resistin , leptin , soluble ICAM-1 , soluble CD40 ligand , monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 ( MCP-1 ) , soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor ( sTNF-R ) well cardiac inflammatory biomarkers routine chemistry drawn ( pre-TPE ) end ( post-TPE ) first second TPE session .</detailed_description>
