	<brief_summary>Acute kidney injury require renal replacement therapy common critically ill patient . The major cause AKI severe sepsis septic shock require effective antibiotic treatment . Patients sepsis ICUs usually haemodynamically instable renal replacement therapy apply use continuous technique . In recent year , efficacy renal replacement therapy improve , namely use regional citrate anticoagulation improve filter lifetime filter patency . At present , extent removal antibiotic drug use citrate-anticoagulated CVVHD critically ill patient investigated thoroughly . Thus , investigator want investigate 1. whether extent antibiotic drug ( piperacillin/tazobactam imipenem/cilastatin ) remove citrate-anticoagulated CVVHD per se 2. whether filter patency citrate-anticoagulated CVVD remain stable treatment period 72 h</brief_summary>
