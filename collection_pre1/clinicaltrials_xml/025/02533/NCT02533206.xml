	<brief_summary>Chronic sinusitis one common chronic disease North America , 5 % Canadian population affect disease . Until , treatment surgery perform operating room . Recently small surgical procedure do clinic patient chronic sinusitis polyp find result symptom control appear similar occurs sinus surgery . Performing small clinical procedure advantage include short recovery time patient , much low cost health care system procedure , short patient wait time procedure do comparison sinus surgery perform operating room . To know great certainty procedure perform clinic good operating room sinus surgery , large multiple investigator randomise clinical trial design . However , carry trial , practice run internal pilot study trial require ensure trial recruit patient rate anticipate procedure obtain measurement use large study adequate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study The EPIC Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For propose internal pilot study 20 patient consent participate meet inclusion criterion none inclusion criterion enrol . The internal pilot study carry site locate Ottawa , Winchester , Toronto , Barrie , Sault Saint Marie London Ontario . A total 7 investigator-surgeons participate . Since internal pilot study sample size calculate , rather , 20 patient enrol internal pilot study include part total sample definite non-inferiority trial , calculate 140 patient . The pilot recruit 15 % total sample sufficient achieve main goal pilot i.e . establish feasibility main trial . Eligible participant randomly assign 1:1 fashion either experimental ( endoscopic polypectomy perform clinic , EPIC ) control group ( functional endoscopic sinus surgery , FESS ) . Patients allocate treatment group use web-based central randomization protect bias , data use confirm design non-inferiority randomize control trial . Duration treatment period For experimental ( endoscopic polypectomy perform clinic , EPIC ) control ( functional endoscopic sinus surgery , FESS ) group , day treatment complete consider time `` 0 '' . There change either procedure relate participant enrol study . After treatment day , participant enter follow-up period final study relate evaluation 90 ( ± 5 ) day follow procedure . Frequency duration follow Enrolled participant re-evaluated investigator procedure twice , normal frequency visit postoperative care patient undergone surgical treatment chronic rhinosinusitis polyp . The first follow-up evaluation 15 day ( ± 5 day ) follow procedure last occur 90 day ( ± 5 day ) follow treatment . The last follow-up chosen 90 day give primary outcome measure interest sinonasal outcome test-22 ( SNOT-22 ) score . Three month treatment SNOT-22 appear change substantially follow-up . A landmark study complete Hopkins et al . ( 2006 ) cohort 3000 patient undergone endoscopic sinus surgery chronic sinusitis follow 36 month demonstrate sinonasal outcome test SNOT-22 score 3 month follow surgery different measure 12 36 month . Therefore , 3-month ( 90 day ) follow-up specifically choose study give primary outcome measure use also SNOT-22 score . Long Term Follow : After second follow visit , patient enter long term follow-up period last 5 year . During period , patient receive follow questionnaire via mail : SNOT-22 , EuroQol ( EQ-5D-5L ) questionnaire , work productivity impairment questionnaire ( WPAI ) , Satisfaction Survey Individual Health Resource Consumption . These questionnaire mail 6 month , 1,2,3,4 5 year procedure . At time patient also ask additional surgery chronic rhinosinusitis nasal polyp</detailed_description>
