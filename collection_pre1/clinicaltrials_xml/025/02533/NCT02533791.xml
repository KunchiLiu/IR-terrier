In 2014 , single center , double-blind , placebo control , dose-escalation phase 1 clinical trial perform Taizhou , China . Our finding show Ad5-EBOV vaccine safe robustly immunogenic . One shot high dose vaccine could mount glycoprotein-specific humoral T-cell response Ebola virus 14 day . The investigator intent evaluate safety immunogenicity booster dose recombinant Ebola adenovirus vector vaccine ( Ad5-EBOV ) healthy adult primary immunization add study . The investigator expect boost immunization vaccine primary immunization possible could confer longer-lived protection need .
