	<brief_summary>The presence Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome ( OSAS ) high frequency patient victim coronary artery disease ( CAD ) ( myocardial infarction , revascularization ) . Unlike patient see sleep Laboratory impact daytime functioning , CAD apneic patient complain daytime functioning . The objective study explore whether objective cognitive assessment measure may good marker efficacy CPAP treatment give non-sleepy apneic CAD patient . Coronary patient AHI 15 40 / h treat ( ) randomization CPAP treatment . The expected result : CPAP apneic coronary patient positive impact cognitive performance , particularly attention span work memory measure improvement Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test score ( PASAT score ) .</brief_summary>
