	<brief_summary>This study investigate incidence undiagnosed ulnar neuropathy patient undergo surgery . The investigator hope determine patient ulnar neuropathy change nerve conduction latency surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Preoperative Prevalence Ulnar Neuropathy Changes Ulnar Nerve Latency During Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After obtain informed consent , participate subject ask question relate ulnar nerve dysfunction . Following investigator focus physical exam look decrement sensation distribution ulnar nerve muscle strength hand muscle supply ulnar nerve . After subject undergo EMG exam measure conduction velocity ulnar nerve . Basically nerve stimulate small current resultant muscle activity hand muscle pick use EKG like patch apply skin hand . If subject diagnose ulnar neuropathy preoperatively investigator would study EMG base nerve conduction surgery 30-60 minute interval duration surgery . For purpose comparison investigator would measure ulnar nerve conduction surgery age sex match control .</detailed_description>
