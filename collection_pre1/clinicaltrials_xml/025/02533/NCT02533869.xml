	<brief_summary>This study focus use contrast enhance low-dose CT image modality differentiate uncomplicated complicate acute appendicitis . Differentiation two form acute appendicitis important accord recent study treatment differs . Complicated form still treat operatively , uncomplicated form treat conservatively antibiotic . In initial phase study , several optimize CT protocol create phantom model . The two best perform model select second phase study , patient present suspected acute appendicitis image two protocol . All patient participate study treat operatively , primarily laparoscopic appendectomy . Thus histological confirmation diagnosis achieve compare CT image .

	<brief_title>The Optimization Low-dose Computed Tomography Protocol Patients With Suspected Uncomplicated Acute Appendicitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute appendicitis one common cause abdominal pain emergency department well one common indication emergency abdominal surgery . The clinical diagnosis base patient history , physical examination laboratory finding well `` clinical eye '' surgeon . Still diagnosis remain challenge . One main problem many disorder mimic clinical presentation appendicitis , thus increase role image technique aid diagnostic accuracy . Now preoperative imaging patient suspect acute appendicitis currently widely accept standard practice , CT show clearly outperform US term diagnostic performance . Nowadays , CT image consider primary image modality diagnosis acute appendicitis appraise high sensitivity specificity . The main disadvantage CT imaging exposure radiation . Thus favorable diagnostic performance CT image encourage optimization protocol minimize exposure radiation development low-dose CT protocol . Initial study indicate contrast enhance low-dose CT inferior standard-dose contrast enhance CT statistical significance negative appendectomy rate , appendiceal perforation rate patient require additional imaging . This study focus use contrast enhance low-dose CT image modality differentiate uncomplicated complicate acute appendicitis . Differentiation two form acute appendicitis important accord recent study treatment differs . Complicated form still treat operatively , uncomplicated form treat conservatively antibiotic . In initial phase study , several optimize CT protocol create phantom model . The two best perform model select second phase study , patient present suspected acute appendicitis image two protocol . All patient participate study treat operatively , primarily laparoscopic appendectomy . Thus histological confirmation diagnosis achieve compare CT image . The goal study optimize well-performing low-dose CT imaging protocol use diagnosis uncomplicated acute appendicitis .</detailed_description>
