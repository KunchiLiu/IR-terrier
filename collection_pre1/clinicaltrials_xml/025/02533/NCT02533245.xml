	<detailed_description>During last decade advance solid organ transplantation , like e.g . organ preservation , surgical technique immunosuppressive treatment contribute improvement postoperative survival . Thereby , solid organ transplantation ( Tx ) move experimental treatment towards clinical reality life-saving surgery , offer patient good long-term survival . However , improvement long-term survival remain major challenge . It increasingly recognize non-pharmacological intervention hold potential improve long-term outcome transplantation evidence show health behavior independently associate transplant outcome ( e.g . physical activity , non-smoking , medication adherence ) . Furthermore , exercise training intervention show positive outcome number population limit research transplantation show positive outcome view exercise capacity , muscle strength , cardiopulmonary variable body composition . However , lack research evaluate exercise train intervention view patient report outcomes ( PROs ) transplant recipient . In University Hospitals Leuven ( Belgium ) project name 'Transplantoux ' launched enhance physical activity exercise capacity transplant recipient . Transplant recipient participate 'Transplantoux ' exercise training intervention 6-months ultimate goal cycle hike Mont Ventoux ( France ) ( distance : 25.9 km , mean slope : 4.4 % ) . Extending previous safety feasibility study demonstrate select Transplant recipient safely participate intense exercise program exercise capacity significantly improve training . The primary aim current study evaluate short- long-term effect 'Transplantoux ' intervention view select Patient Reported Outcomes ( PROs ) , i.e . perceive health-related quality-of-life , depressive symptomatology , stress well-being , physical activity , social contact social support , barrier motivator exercise . The Transplantoux Health Evaluation Study ( THES ) use quasi-experimental design three convenience sample : 1 ) convenience sample solid organ transplant ( Tx ) -recipients participate Transplantoux exercise training intervention , 2 ) match control sample Tx-recipients participate Transplantoux exercise intervention , 3 ) convenience sample healthy control participate Transplantoux exercise intervention . Selected PROs assess use validate self-reported questionnaire . Data collection perform baseline , 3 month ( middle training intervention ) , 6 month ( immediately follow intervention ) , 9 month ( 3 month follow-up period ) 12 month ( 6 month follow-up period ) .</detailed_description>
