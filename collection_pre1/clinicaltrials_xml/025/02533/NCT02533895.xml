	<brief_summary>This un-blinded Phase 1 study 21 patient suffer solid advanced paediatric malignancy ( 14 sarcoma 7 non-sarcoma patient ) treat AV0113 , anti-tumour immune therapy autologous Dendritic Cells ( DCs ) load tumour cell lysates , order investigate safety feasibility . For obtain clear picture AV0113 's utility treatment bone soft tissue sarcoma , long-term ( LT ) follow-up investigation 14 sarcoma patient , treat use AV0113 Dendritic Cell Cancer Immune Therapy ( DC-CIT ) technology plan , order gather first evidence potential LT effect DC-CIT AV0113 . Furthermore , comparison 14 sarcoma patient treat AV0113 DC-CIT cohort match historic control patient treat use standard care conduct . It plan analyse 42 historic control sarcoma patient match disease , recurrence , relapse etc .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In phase I trial 21 paediatric patient solid tumour childhood ( 14 sarcoma 7 non-sarcoma patient ) exhaust conventional treatment option recruit treatment AV0113 . Peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( MNCs ) obtain patient leukocyte apheresis . Monocytes enrich density gradient centrifugation MNCs use generate immature DCs cultivation recombinant human interleukin-4 ( IL-4 ) granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating-factor ( GM-CSF ) . These immature DCs load autologous tumour cell lysates obtain needle biopsy surgery prior tumour vaccination.The antigen load immature DCs receive final maturation stimulus transmit exposure lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) interferon-gamma ( IFN-gamma ) . Maturation enable DCs present antigen high efficiency T-lymphocytes . Subsequently , mature load DCs inject subcutaneously close tumour free lymph node intra-nodally tumour free lymph node weekly interval least 6 week . It anticipate establish feasibility safety tumour vaccination describe clinical setting find clinical and/or experimental evidence induction anti-tumour immune response . For obtain clear picture AV0113 's utility treatment bone soft tissue sarcoma , long-term ( LT ) follow-up investigation 14 Sarcoma patient , treat use AV0113 DC-CIT technology plan , order gather first evidence potential LT effect DC-CIT AV0113 . Furthermore , comparison 14 sarcoma patient treat AV0113 DC-CIT cohort match historic control patient treat use standard care conduct . It plan analyse 42 historic control sarcoma patient match disease , recurrence , relapse etc .</detailed_description>
