	<brief_summary>Major adverse cardiovascular event ( MACE ) lead cause serious complication death follow major noncardiac surgery . The heart biomarkers brain-type natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) high-sensitivity troponin I/T ( hs-TnI/T ) , may aid estimate risk surgery - low value may permit identify patient low risk postoperative complication , potentially help avoid unnecessary test delay prior surgery . Recent study suggest manner anesthetic conduct may important impact postoperative outcome . The combination low blood pressure ( BP ) deep level anesthesia despite low dose anesthetic - also know `` triple low '' - link increased complication death follow surgery . However , unclear whether triple low actually cause postoperative complication whether merely indicator sick patient , general likely suffer cardiovascular event near future . To answer question , study patient randomly assign group low high blood pressure , postoperative rate major adverse cardiovascular event relevant increase hs-TnI ( marker cardiac injury ) compare . Another important question optimal blood pressure target surgery . Currently establish method tailor blood pressure management individual patient . In study investigator perform ambulatory 24h BP measurement prior surgery measure patient ' average BP sleep . In analysis study data , investigator try determine relationship preoperative biomarker level , intraoperative BP ( relation fix target patient 's night-time BP ) anesthetic depth occurrence major adverse cardiovascular event surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Hypothesis purpose This study base hypothesis normal preoperative cardiac biomarkers , lack intraoperative hypotension BIS value 45-60 associated good outcome compare elevated biomarkers , intraoperative hypotension and/or BIS value 45 . Additionally , investigator hypothesize tight blood pressure management reduces incidence adverse outcome compare liberal blood pressure management ( see definition ) . Lastly , investigator test hypothesis individualize , relative low limit blood pressure well predictor adverse outcome absolute , non-individualized limit . 2 . Study design The study comprise cohort study ( RISK ) nest randomize control trial ( RCT ) [ HEMODYNAMICS ] . In period September 2015 August 2018 patient meet inclusion criterion include cohort study ass association perioperative biomarkers , intraoperative blood pressure BIS value occurrence MACE . A small subset patient additionally include RCT ass effect tight versus liberal blood pressure management MACE . Cardiac risk assessment optimization perform accord clinical practice investigator ' institution , follow internal guideline ( base 2007 ACC/AHA guideline . In addition , preoperative cardiac biomarkers ( BNP hsTnI ) measure . Intraoperative blood pressure management base internal hemodynamic management algorithm , however cohort study intervention threshold leave discretion anesthesiologist . The occurrence MACE assess 30 day one year surgery . The association preoperative biomarker level occurrence intraoperative hypotension investigate . In RCT , patient assess similarly protocol cohort study , however patient randomly assign either tight ( mean arterial pressure [ MAP ] &gt; 75 mmHg ) liberal ( MAP discretion anesthesiologist , &lt; 60mmHg ) blood pressure management use hemodynamic management algorithm whole cohort . In subset RCT patient , nighttime blood pressure profile obtain additionally define presume individual low blood pressure limit ( i.e . mean MAP natural sleep ) . The association intraoperative time spend individual low blood pressure limit occurrence adverse outcome assess . 3 . Sample Size The sample size calculation Clinical Trials Unit St. Gallen indicate RCT , assume 10 % drop-out rate , 458 patient necessary detect difference 33 % liberal tight BP group primary composite endpoint MACE ( α=0.05 , β=0.2 ) . 4 . Statistical Analysis In RCT , potential difference incidence primary endpoint tight liberal BP group assess use χ2 statistic . In cohort study , investigator generate logistic regression model use primary ( secondary ) outcome dependent variable . The investigator model preoperative level cardiac biomarkers ( quartile dichotomize ) , time spend prespecified mean arterial pressure ( &lt; 75 mmHg , &lt; 60 individual average mean arterial pressure natural sleep ) time spend BIS &lt; 45 . The model adjust follow prespecified independent variable : Charlson Comorbidity Index , Lee Revised Cardiac Risk Index , age sex . The number independent variable limit avoid overfitting model . For dichotomization BNP , investigator define optimal cut-off value use receiver operate characteristic curve primary outcome assumption equal weight sensitivity specificity . The null hypothesis consider refuted 2-sided p-value &lt; 0.05 . Based previous experience similar study , investigator expect small number loss follow ( &lt; 2 % ) . If number exceed 5 % Cox regression model use time composite endpoint ( time last contact , loss follow occur ) dependent variable calculate . Missing perioperative BNP value handle normal ( &lt; 50 pg/ml ) . Any miss perioperative laboratory value shall also assume normal .</detailed_description>
