	<detailed_description>There four study visit ; screening/baseline follow eight week train three time week , visit 1 eight week follow 4 week washout , Visit 2 12 week follow eight week train three time week , final Visit 3 20 week . At screen visit , volunteer ask perform test include short physical performance battery ( SPPB ) ( gait speed , chair rise , balance ) . If participant score ≤ 9 ≤ 2 three test include SPPB eligible intervention phase . At baseline visit several questionnaire obtain participant proceed muscle function test ( SPPB , jump mechanography , grip strength , timed-up-and-go test ) . Participants randomize one two group . The first group receive vibration + loading treatment first 8 week , second group receive sham treatment ( load ) . After 8 week group go 4 week wash-out period crossover occur . The first group receive sham treatment ( load ) second group receive vibration + loading treatment . The participant train 10 minute , 3 time week , active 16 total week .</detailed_description>
