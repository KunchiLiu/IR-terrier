	<brief_summary>Present criterion use define sepsis non-specific , make difficult distinguish sepsis disease predict patient likely become severely ill . In standard care , patient risk become severely ill neither identified indicated resuscitative effort develop hemodynamic insufficiency organ failure ; progression severe disease , mortality increase significantly . The identification risk patient lead early initiation resuscitation therapy potentially lead reduce morbidity mortality . This study aim determine whether Heparin-binding protein ( HBP ) , secrete neutrophils infection mediator vascular leakage , act biomarker progression severe sepsis circulatory failure . The objective study validate utility HBP predict development delay onset organ dysfunction sepsis patient compare performance HBP relative currently use prognostic biomarkers sepsis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sepsis heterogeneous disorder cause invasive infection result host inflammatory response . The underlying pathogenesis complex dependent etiologic microorganism , site infection , host factor . Present criterion define sepsis ( include change body temperature , increase heart respiration rate , leukocytosis/leukopenia ) non-specific make difficult distinguish sepsis disease particular predict patient likely become severely ill . The consensus definition sepsis debate past year one suggest approach focus presence organ dysfunction . In standard care , patient risk become seriously ill identify indicated resuscitative effort develop hemodynamic insufficiency organ failure . However , progression severe disease mortality increase significantly . A recent study show almost quarter patient present uncomplicated sepsis Emergency Department ( ED ) develop severe sepsis septic shock within 72 hour . Delayed in-hospital progression increase organ dysfunction associate increase transfer intensive care unit ( ICU ) increase hospital length stay . The identification risk patient lead early initiation resuscitation therapy potentially lead reduce morbidity mortality . There also increase evidence single episode severe sepsis negative impact quality life mortality several year actual incident . Also , recent study indicate less severe organ dysfunction , small increase serum creatinine , associate increase long-term mortality among sepsis survivor . Mechanisms trigger release heparin-binding protein ( HBP ) neutrophils presence bacteria previously report . HBP several function chemo-attractant activator monocyte macrophage . Also , induces vascular leakage interact capillary endothelium break cell barrier . In vivo study demonstrate HBP release complex form group A streptococcal M1 protein fibrinogen induces massive tissue edema contribute severe organ damage . In clinical investigation , release HBP demonstrate various infectious disease cause wide array bacteria . A recent single-center study patient admit suspected infection fever show plasma level HBP significantly high among patient present develop severe sepsis circulatory failure . A prospective observational study tertiary care Emergency Department . Patients must identify enrol within 72 hour qualify inclusion criterion . At time , unused blood sample collect routine testing examine plasma level HBP record ; blood sample process lab within 3 hour collection use . In addition , physiologic variable detail data element section , include mental status , metabolic , renal , heme , hepatic , respiratory , cardiovascular , resuscitation , vasopressor use record . Patients meet inclusion criterion identify . Researchers collect record resuscitation summary span 4 hour ; data , outline data element section , link quality improvement ( QI ) database Sepsis Research . Additionally , patient 's HBP plasma level measure unused blood sample collect routine lab test time ( T ) 24 , 48 , 72-hours ( T24 , T48 , T72 ) meeting inclusion criterion ( T0 ) ; resuscitation summary also collect T24 , T48 , T72 . For patient meet sepsis alert criterion , T0 define time patient qualify ; enrol base Predisposition , Injury , Response , Organ dysfunction ( PIRO ) score T0 define time hospital admission order . Patients follow throughout time hospital outcomes record .</detailed_description>
