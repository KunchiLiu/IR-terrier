	<brief_summary>This randomize control trial ( RCT ) regard conservative treatment chronic ankle instability ( CAI ) impairment base rehabilitation program . Individuals CAI deficit neuromuscular control alter gait pattern . Ankle destabilization shoe use clinically may improve neuromuscular control increase low extremity muscle activation , may improve gait pattern . The investigator ' purpose determine whether 4-week rehabilitation program include ankle destabilization shoe ( experimental ) beneficial effect self-reported function ankle gait kinematics compare traditional rehabilitation without destabilization shoe ( control ) CAI patient . In addition , investigator compare ankle strength balance CAI patient healthy individual history ankle injury prior 4-week rehabilitation . The investigator hypothesize experimental group great improvement self-reported function frontal sagittal plane kinematics walk compare control group . In addition , investigator hypothesize patient CAI decrease ankle strength balance compare healthy individual . The design single-blinded randomized control trial . Forty CAI patient complete baseline self-reported function questionnaire walk gait trial randomize control experimental group . Both group complete 4-weeks supervised rehabilitation without destabilization shoe repeat questionnaire walk trial .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>CAI history recurrent ankle sprain , first sprain occur long 12 month ago . Participants linger symptom , disability , actively seek treatment CAI All participant physically active : Participating form physical activity least 20 min per day , three time per week . Neurological vestibular disorder affect balance Currently seek medical care CAI History prior ankle surgery History ankle sprain within past 6 week History ankle fracture Diabetes mellitus Current selfreported disability due low extremity pathology may adversely affect neuromuscular function Lumbosacral radiculopathy Pregnant Soft tissue disorder include Marfan 's syndrome EhlersDandros syndrome</criteria>
