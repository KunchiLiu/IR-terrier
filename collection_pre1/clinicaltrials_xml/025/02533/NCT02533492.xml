	<brief_summary>Total knee replacement one popular reconstructive procedure elderly people regain functional capacity life quality . However report incidence postoperative infection surgical site infection total knee replacement around 1 2 percent . The cost expenditure treat periprosthetic infection high result often detrimental patient suffer complication . To decrease wound heal complication relate contamination bacteria , antibacterial suture use successfully clinical setting animal experiment . Whether antibacterial suture material could use patient total knee replacement address past . The investigator therefore propose prospective randomize double-blinded study investigate efficacy antibacterial suture material total knee replacement . The inclusion criterion patient degenerative osteoarthritis without previous surgery index knee . Patients inflammatory arthritis rheumatoid arthritis , neurovascular disease low extremity , history liver cirrhosis hemodialysis renal failure exclude . One hundred two patient randomize study group ( 51 knee ) control group ( 51 knee ) period 12 month . All case follow standard protocol base clinical pathway . Antibacterial suture material ( Vicryl Plus , Ethicon ) use study group regular suture material ( Vicryl , Ethicon ) use control group . Preoperatively , skin condition ( digital photo image analysis ) , laser Doppler study , inflammatory marker ( CRP/ESR/IL-6 ) , functional score ( KSS : Knee Society Score ; SF-12 : Short Form 12 ) , VAS score assess . Operative data operation time , blood loss wound classification record . Postoperatively , skin condition ( digital photo image analysis ) , skin temperature , inflammatory marker , KSS , VAS assess 1st 3rd postoperative day , 2 week , 4 week , 3 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Compare Antimicrobial Conventional Suture Patients Receiving Primary Total Knee Replacement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Title study : Compare result Antimicrobial Conventional suture material patient receive primary total knee replacement : prospective double-blinded randomize control trial Objectives : Primary Objective : To investigate whether surgical site infection rate total knee replacement different two different suture material . Secondary Objective : To investigate surrogating marker inflammatory response functional outcome two different suture material . Rationale : The reported rate deep infection follow contemporary total knee replacement two percent . The prevalence prolong wound drainage soft tissue complication 17 50 % patient 1.3 % eventually develop culture-proved prosthetic infection . Total knee infection typically require complete removal prosthesis prolong antibiotic treatment . Re-infection rate follow revision surgery infect total knee case also significantly high without infection complication . Total knee infection devastate associate prolonged hospital stay , increase co-morbidity , utilization medical resource . Measures reduce infection rate extensively implement clinically . However use antibacterial suture material reduce wound complication yet investigate . Clinical trial include issue discuss animal study minimal series . The effectiveness new material check . This study design investigate wound condition deep infection incidence follow total knee replacement perform use either antimicrobial conventional suture . A prospective , double-blinded , randomize control trial 102 patient evenly distribute two group propose . Each group 51 patient schedule unilateral total knee replacement . Randomization envelope-drawing minimize confounding risk factor . One hundred two set suture material ( 51 set Vicryl Plus 51 set Vicryl ) separately put seal envelope . The envelope randomly assign consecutive number 1 102 . The envelope randomly give patient wound closure . Finally , one group patient receive antibacterial suture ( VICRYL Plus , Ethicon , Johnson Johnson , Taipei , Taiwan ) follow total knee replacement wound closure group patient receive conventional suture ( VICRYL , Ethicon , Johnson Johnson , Taipei , Taiwan ) follow total knee replacement wound closure . Group sample size 51 51 achieve 81 % power detect difference -4 % null hypothesis group mean 9.0 alternative hypothesis mean 13.0 estimate group standard deviations 6.0 8.0 significance level ( alpha ) 0.05 use two-sided two-sample t-test . The primary outcome measure incidence prosthetic infection within three month surgery . The secondary outcome measure include hospital stay , duration antibiotic use , pain scale ( VAS ) , wound condition ( wound drainage , extent erythema , local heat , temperature ) , serum parameter hospitalization within three month operation .</detailed_description>
