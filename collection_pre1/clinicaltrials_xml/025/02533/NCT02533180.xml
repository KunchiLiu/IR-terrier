	<brief_title>Evaluation Donor Specific Immune Senescence Exhaustion Biomarkers Tolerance Post Liver Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>People liver transplant must take anti-rejection medication ( immunosuppression ) rest life . If stop , immune system may reject transplant liver . All anti-rejection medication side effect . Because side effect anti-rejection medication , important goal transplant research allow people accept transplant organ without long term use anti-rejection medication . This call tolerance . In study , participant receive liver transplant anti-rejection medication ( ) gradually reduced period time stop . The study call 'immunosuppression withdrawal ' . The purpose research study see many people develop tolerance immunosuppression withdrawal . The researcher also want find blood liver biopsy test help transplant doctor future predict whether safe decrease stop anti-rejection medication people receive liver transplant .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Recipient participant must meet follow criterion eligible study : 1 . At time screening : 18 50 year old 6 year posttransplant OR Greater 50 year old 3 year posttransplant 2 . Recipient either decease live donor liver transplant . Recipients live donor transplant must donor also willing enroll . 3 . Recipient single organ transplant 4 . Must screen liver biopsy fulfills follow criterion base central pathology reading : Portal inflammation interface activity preferably absent , minimal focal mild portal mononuclear inflammation may present . Interface necroinflammatory activity absent equivocal/minimal , present , involve minority portal tract generally associate fibrosis . Negative perivenular inflammation . Lymphocytic bile duct damage , ductopenia , biliary epithelial senescence change absent unless alternative , nonimmunological explanation ( e.g . biliary stricture ) . Fibrosis ( present ) mild overall , portaltoportal bridging rare . Perivenular perisinusoidal fibrosis mild accord Banff criterion . Findings obliterative foam cell arteriopathy negative . 5 . Liver function test ( Direct bilirubin , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) ) , less twice upper limit normal ( ULN ) . ULN value liver function test define range Harrison 's Principles Internal Medicine , 18th edition . 6 . Receiving calcineurin inhibitor ( CNI ) base maintenance immunosuppression . Participants may also concurrently receive : Low dose mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ≤ 1500 mg daily ) mycophenolic acid ( ≤ 1080 mg daily ) , OR Prednisone ≤ 7.5 mg daily , equivalent corticosteroid.. 7 . Ability sign inform consent Living donor participant must meet follow criterion eligible study : 1 . At time screening : ≥18 year old 2 . Living donor liver allograft enrol recipient participant 3 . Ability sign inform consent 4 . Willingness donate appropriate biologic sample Recipient participant meet follow criterion eligible study : 1 . History hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection ( define positive HCV antibody test ) . 2 . Positive antigenantibody immunoassay human immunodeficiency virus , HIV1/2 . 3 . Serum positivity HBV surface antigen HBVDNA . 4 . History immunemediated liver disease immunosuppression discontinuation inadvisable ( autoimmune hepatitis , primary sclerosing cholangitis , primary biliary cirrhosis ) . 5 . Any medical condition associate likely need systemic corticosteroid administration , e.g. , reactive airway disease . 6 . Prospective baseline liver biopsy show follow : ( see recipient inclusion criterion # 4 ) acute rejection accord Banff global assessment criterion ; early late chronic rejection accord Banff global assessment criterion inflammatory activity and/or fibrosis excess permissive criterion accord Banff 2012 criterion ; histological finding might make participation trial unsafe . Eligibility determine finding central biopsy reading . 7 . Rejection within 52 week prior screen . 8 . Estimated glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) &lt; 40 ml/min calculate CKDEPI method ( mitigate risk worsen renal failure rejection occur high level CNI require ) . 9 . The need chronic anticoagulation safely discontinue minimum 1 week safely perform liver biopsy . 10 . Pregnant female female childbearing age use effective method birth control . 11 . Current drug alcohol dependency . 12 . Inability comply study visit schedule require assessment , include frequent liver function monitor protocol biopsy . 13 . Inability comply study direct treatment . 14 . Any medical condition opinion principal investigator would interfere safe completion trial . 15 . Participation another interventional clinical trial within 4 week prior screen . Living donor participant meet follow criterion eligible study : 1 . Any medical condition , anemia , coagulopathy , etc. , opinion principal investigator would interfere safe participation trial .</criteria>
