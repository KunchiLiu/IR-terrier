	<brief_summary>Accumulating data early intervention preterm infant Western country demonstrate short- medium-term benefit enhance child cognitive outcome . Furthermore , cumulative plasticity dopamine-related gene may interact environmental intervention influence child 's behavior . However , rare study examine long-term effect early intervention preterm infant Eastern society whether genetic marker interact environmental intervention shape child developmental outcome . To meet contemporary concept family-centered intervention adapt finding previous study program design , develop family-centered intervention program ( FCIP ) preterm infant low birth weight ( VLBW , birth weight &lt; 1,500 g ) Taiwan employ multi-centered , randomize control study design examine short-term effect respect usual care program ( UCP ) biosocial pathways.The FCIP contain ecologically pervasive child- , parent- dyad-focused service last hospitalization 12 month ; UCP contain child-focused service hospitalization phone call discharge . This three-year multi-centered study therefore aim extend research examine long-term effectiveness FCIP child parent outcome compare usual care program ( UCP ) VLBW preterm child Taiwan preschool age investigate dopamine-related gene moderate intervention effect child developmental outcome . A total 270 VLBW preterm infant enrol randomly assign FCIP UCP , buccal cell sample collect type dopamine-related gene . All infant family examine 3 4 year age child parent outcome . Child outcomes include growth , health , cognition , language , motor function , behavioral measure ; parent outcome consist parental stress quality life measure . The long-term effect early intervention preterm infant provide important information help medical/educational professional public policy maker develop assess effective intervention Taiwanese preterm child risk developmental disorder . Furthermore , result help reveal gene intervention interaction child developmental outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Purposes : This study extend previous research longitudinally examine effectiveness FCIP UCP VLBW preterm child Taiwan 3 4 year age investigate dopamine-related gene moderate intervention effect child developmental outcome . Effectiveness examine include child parent outcome . Child outcomes consist growth , health , neurodevelopment ( cognition , language motor function ) behavior . Parent outcome include parental stress quality life . The long-term effect early intervention preterm child neonatal period preschool age provide important information help medical professional public policy maker develop effective intervention Taiwanese preterm child risk developmental problem . Furthermore , genetic susceptibility theory cumulative genetic plasticity theory use examine relation polymorphisms dopamine-related gene child development possible interaction environmental intervention child development . Over twenty dopamine genetic marker identify extensive research associate plasticity neurodevelopmental function examine individual synergistic influence developmental outcome . Participants : Two hundred seventy VLBW preterm child participate previous study bear admit National Taiwan University Hospital ( NTUH ) , Mackay Memorial Hospital ( MMH ) National Cheng Kung University Hospital ( NCKUH ) period April 2012 December 2014 enrol study . Methods : All family contact via phone call mail participate study . Children parent examine follow outcomes child approach 3 4 year age . All measure conduct Infant Motor Development Laboratory , School Physical Therapy , National Taiwan University , Cognitive Electrophysiology Laboratory , Institute Cognitive Science , National Cheng Kung University . The outcome measure study consist primary child outcome ( growth , health , neurodevelopment [ cognitive , language motor function ] behavior ) secondary parent outcome ( parental stress quality life ) . Child neurodevelopment examine use Bayley Scales Infant Development- 2nd edition , Bayley Scales Infant Toddler Development-3rd edition , Movement Assessment Battery Children-2nd Edition , Wechsler PreSchool Primary Scales Intelligence-4th Edition . Child behavior examine use Children 's Behavior Questionnaire , Swanson , Nolan , Pelham Questionnaire- 4th Edition , Child Behavior Check List/4-18 . Parental stress assess use Parenting Stress Index-Long Form quality life assess use Chinese Version World Health Organization Quality Life- Brief Taiwan Version . Each assessment delineate follow .</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Premature Birth</mesh_term>
	<criteria>The inclusion criterion VLBW preterm infant : 1. birth weight less 1,500 gram 2. gestational age lower 37 week The inclusion criterion parent : 1. mother old 18 year age ; 2 . Taiwan nationality 3. absence maternal substance abuse ( alcohol drug ) 4. marry live together delivery 5. family reside northern southern Taiwan . The exclusion criterion VLBW preterm infant : 1. congenital abnormality 2. severe neonatal perinatal disease : Severe neonatal disease refer major neurologic abnormality ( e.g. , seizure , hydrocephalus , ventriculoperitoneal shunt , meningitis , periventricular leukomalacia , grade IIIIV intraventricular hemorrhage stage IVV retinopathy prematurity ) , necrotizing enterocolitis grade II severe cardiopulmonary disease require daily oxygen use hospital discharge may require intensive developmental intervention therefore suit intervention . Furthermore , infant exhibit persistently unstable physiological condition 36 week ' PMA older , discharge hospital 44 week ' PMA older , develop severe neonatal disease early terminate .</criteria>
