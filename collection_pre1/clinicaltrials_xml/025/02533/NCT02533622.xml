	<brief_summary>Despite know complication immobility ICU patient , compliance mobility protocols lack many institution . Significant barrier describe compliance chair weight bear order ICU . Recent study indicate progressive mobility perform acutely ill ICU patient may reduce ICU length stay , reduce overall hospital length stay , incur low hospital cost , reduce rate medical complication increase functionality post ICU discharge . The current protocol seek understand whether TotalCare® P500 Bed System Liko Lift remove barrier associate progressive mobility compliance .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study design process improvement program increase compliance progressive mobility protocol ICU setting . The first part study ( 4-6 month period depend time require implementation ) document 1st day weight bear well secondary outcome measure progressive mobility protocol currently place ICU patient meet inclusion/exclusion criterion . Ease progressive mobility implementation assess . Appropriate education perform importance progressive mobility . The second part study ( 4-6 month ) document outcome , however , progressive mobility protocol include standardized process use Total Care® P500 Bed System combine Liko Lift . During second study period , patient progress step protocol ( see section 6.2 ) begin head bed ( HOB ) 30o initiate orthostatic stress three time daily increase time interval , increase HOB angle , time , finally stand bear weight . The Total Care® P500 Bed System Liko Lift place participate unit duration second phase study . Compliance specific outcome measure measure well ease Progressive Mobility implementation . The total study period 8-12 month ( allow time bed delivery education ) . Patients meet inclusion/exclusion criterion study enrol . Protocol base `` chair '' `` standing '' order follow compliance , length actual sit full chair stand . If patient undergo `` full chair '' bed , consider `` chair . '' Time/days first weight bearing , define weight bearing stand position least 1 minute document . ICU LOS , Ventilator Days assess ICU discharge study patient . Nursing satisfaction ease PM protocol adherence survey perform study period assess standard care Total Care® bed/Liko lift system .</detailed_description>
