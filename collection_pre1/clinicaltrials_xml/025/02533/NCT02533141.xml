	<brief_summary>Statins drug represent commonly prescribe medication treatment hypercholesterolemia . In recently publish study , discontinuation statin therapy patient acute myocardial infarction associate high all-cause mortality ( hazard ratio 3,45 ) high cardiac mortality ( hazard ratio 4,65 ) . Increasing evidence suggest statin also vasoactive property up-regulating endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( eNOS ) positive effect endothelial function . Experiments flow-mediated vasodilatation ( FMD ) show positive effect statin treatment endothelial function also reveal withdrawal statin treatment transiently worsen endothelial function , independently serum cholesterol level . Consequently , placebo control Phase IV crossover study want assess change endothelial function term flicker induce vasodilatation statin therapy well statin withdrawal . For purpose 20 healthy subject treat 40 mg/day simvastatin period 4 week . Flicker induce vasodilatation retinal oxygen saturation measure Dynamic Vessel Analyzer system Imedos baseline , 4th week simvastatin placebo intake well 3 , 7 14 day end intake .</brief_summary>
