	<detailed_description>SPECIFIC AIMS : - Specific Aim 1 : To assess difference pain control , assess validated pain score requirement postoperative analgesia , 14-day post-operative period . - Specific Aim 2 : To assess difference bleed ( hemorrhage ) intraoperatively 24 hour post-surgery ( immediate period ) 24 hour 14 day post-operatively ( delayed period ) . - Specific Aim 3 : To assess difference outcomes ( time resumption normal diet activity ) adverse event ( emergent visit medical care ) 24 hour 14 day post-operatively . BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE : 1 . Epidemiology Tonsillectomy Children . Tonsillectomy second commonly perform procedure child 15 year old , second myringotomy pressure equalization tube placement . It estimate 583,000 outpatient tonsillectomy procedure perform child US 2006 account 16 % ambulatory surgery great number ( 103/10,000 ) child age 0 6 year old . In age group , diagnosis airway obstruction sleep disturbance account majority surgery indication tonsillectomy adenoidectomy account 90 % procedure perform ( vs. 10 % tonsillectomy alone ) . Nemours Jacksonville surgeon perform 995 tonsillectomy with/without adenoidectomy Wolfson Children 's Hospital child 3 6 year old sleep-disordered breathing 2010-2011 . 2 . Surgical Methods Tonsillectomy Children : Surgical technique tonsillectomy include electrocautery , guillotine , laser dissection , harmonic scalpel , argon plasma coagulation , coblation . The commonly used surgical technique Nemours electrocautery coblation . Electrocautery ( bipolar monopolar ) involve use heat produce high-voltage , high frequency alternate current pass electrode apply directly tonsillar tissue expect benefit reduce blood loss cauterization reduce excision adjacent muscle tissue . However , high surface temperature , may exceed 400°C , result deep thermal penetration , collateral tissue damage , associate increase post-operative pain . In project , investigator compare electrocautery surgical method PEAK® Plasma Surgery System [ PEAK PlasmaBlade® TnA Tonsil Adenoid Tissue Dissection Device ] ( Medtronic , Inc ) , recently market device . There publish study compare PEAK® system traditional method perform adenotonsillectomy . Nemours otolaryngologists currently use PEAK® system adenotonsillectomies child 3 18 year age diagnosis sleep-disordered breathing . The PEAK® system generate plasma , `` electrically conductive cloud produce radiofrequency energy contact tissue tissue break '' . The system design precision scalpel , minimal bleeding electrosurgery , reduce collateral thermal tissue damage . Data Medtronic website indicate temperature profile PEAK® system approximately half associate electrosurgery similar cut setting ; human study indicate 66 % 80 % reduction thermal injury depth . PRELIMINARY STUDIES : There preliminary data Nemours use Peak® Plasma System . APPROACH : 1 . Study Design This prospective , randomize , single-blind control study . Patients caregiver study coordinator blind surgical method . This project involve single study visit 6 phone call completion daily diary 14 day follow surgery completion Glasgow Children 's Benefit Inventory 7 6-months surgery . Parents caregiver contact surgery date schedule discus project determine interest . If interested , inclusion/exclusion criterion meet , family advise study invite participate . Parental permission obtain parent/caregiver prior surgery . Children age 3 18 year old include . Stopping Criteria : The study stop unblinded rate postoperative hemorrhage , define Level II Level III , exceed 2 participant surgical group assess first 5-days post-operatively first 30 patient enrol . Post-operative bleeding define follow : Level I . All child report history postoperative hemorrhage , whether clinical evidence . Level II . All child require inpatient admission postoperative hemorrhage regardless need operative intervention . This level exclude child undergo evaluation emergency department report postoperative hemorrhage evidence clot formation hemorrhage deem safe discharge . Level III . All child require return operate department control postoperative bleeding . Patients instruct call clinic one tablespoon blood single episode persistent bleed small amount throughout day . Administration dexamethasone perioperatively find increase risk Level II Level III bleed recent study . Randomization Children randomize block design equal number child randomize electrocautery PEAK® Plasma System surgeon . Caregivers blind surgical technique . The surgeon input device child randomize . The study coordinator blind device child randomize . Surgical Techniques Post-Operative Care Surgical Procedure : Patients prepped usual routine adenotonsillectomy procedure . The procedure perform general anesthesia fellowship train pediatric anesthesiologist . All patient receive 0.5mg/kg dose intravenous dexamethasone ( maximum 15mg ) 11 onset procedure . Patients require adenoidectomy undergo either curette removal follow suction electrocautery ablation suction electrocautery alone . Adenoidectomy technique base upon size adenoid pad enlarge adenoid routinely employ curette . Most child age group receive premedication midazolam 0.5 mg/kg prn anxiety . General anesthesia induce face mask , sevoflurane , nitrous oxide oxygen . A peripheral IV start intravenous fentanyl ( 1-2 ug/kg ) administer . Propofol may administer discretion anesthesiologist . The patient 's trachea intubate direct laryngoscopy . The patient also receive IV dexamethasone , ondansetron , additional fentanyl , need . The maintenance anesthetic include desflurane , nitrous oxide oxygen . At end surgery patient 's trachea extubated patient awake . Post-op rescue analgesic include fentanyl /or morphine . Instrument Settings : Settings method electrocautery PEAK® Plasma System standardize surgeon . For PEAK® Plasma System , set standardize tonsil , 2 coagulation 1 cutting ; adenoid , 7 coagulation , 7 cutting . For electrocautery , set standardize 12 tonsil 30 adenoid . Data Collected Intra-operatively Total blood loss determine method described Walner , et al operate nurse record blood loss base amount suction canister suction tube conclusion procedure . Data extraction blood loss operative report perform data entry specialist study coordinator prevent unblinding study coordinator . The Biomedical Research Department several highly train data entry specialist extract clinical data EHR . Data Collected Post-operatively Parents complete diary card begin day surgery continue 14 day . After 30±4 day follow surgery , study coordinator contact parent patient telephone obtain information incidence late-complications collect global assessment parent 's perception 30-day postoperative period . Assessment consist ask parent state whether child 's pain less , , expect adenotonsillectomy . At assessment , coordinator parent still blind treatment receive . At six-months post-operatively , parent mail Glasgow Children 's Benefit Inventory ( GCBI ) . Unblinding information mail parent 2 week GCBI mail . The following measure collect daily diary card begin Day 0 ( day surgery ) : 1 . Presence bleeding . Post-operative bleeding score follow : - Level I . All child report history postoperative hemorrhage , whether clinical evidence . - Level II . All child require inpatient admission postoperative hemorrhage regardless need operative intervention . This level exclude child undergo evaluation emergency department report postoperative hemorrhage evidence clot formation hemorrhage deem safe discharge . - Level III . All child require return operate department control postoperative bleeding . Children return ED hospital subsequently diagnose Von Willebrand 's disease exclude study include data analysis . 2 . Assessment subjective pain . The child ask parent grade severity pain daily use Wong-Baker FACES pain rating scale 13 morning eating , drinking , take analgesic . The Wong-Baker FACES pain rating scale 0 10 numerical rating scale ( 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 ) face indicate level pain happy face score 0 cry face score 10 . The scale recommend child 3 year old . 3 . Type frequency pain medication record . 4 . Return normal diet . Normal diet define consumption type amount food another family member would able recognize patient undergone throat surgery . Dietary progression liquid soft solid food also document . Diet score 1 , liquid soft diet ; 2 , solid ; 3 , mostly solids ; 4 , normal diet . 5 . Return normal activity . Normal activity define carry type amount daily activity surgery , even still associate fatigue . Activity score 1 , none ; 2 , little ; 3 , mostly normal ; 4 , normal . 6 . At post-operative phone call , study coordinator collect data regard bleed event question document parental phone call visit physician regard parental concern child 's recovery . Assessment Bleeding : The study coordinator query parent phone call elicit follow information period since last phone contact ( adapt Gallagher et al ) : 1 . Has participant evidence bleed mouth ? ________ 1A ) If , skip question # 2 1B ) If yes , bleed stop , participant seek medical help ? 1C ) Where participant seek medical help ( call doctor 's office , primary care doctor , emergency room ) ? 2 . Has participant see medical provider ? 2A ) If yes , see , reason ? 3 . Has participant admit hospital ? 3A ) If yes , participant admit reason ? 4 . Has participant additional surgery ? 4A ) If yes , hospital reason ? Data Collected After 6-Months Six month follow surgery , parent mail Glasgow Children 's Benefit Inventory ( GCBI ) 7 . The GCBI post intervention health-related benefit measure consist 24 broadly word yes/no question applicable area pediatric medicine . The GCBI score compare surgical technique . Parents provide pre-stamped return envelope mail questionnaire back Nemours . The two study group match age sex .</detailed_description>
