	<brief_summary>Cystinosis rare autosomal recessive disorder , characterize abnormal accumulation cystine lysosome . Cystinosis mostly cause mutation cystinosin gene ( CTNS ) . The major mutation , present almost 50 % cystinosis patient , 57-kb deletion . This deletion remove first 9 exon part exon 10 CTNS gene . Exon 10 CTNS gene upstream 5 ' region encodes CARKL gene also first two noncoding exon transient receptor potential channel , vanilloid subfamily member 1 ( TRPV1 ) gene . TRPV1 belong transient receptor potential ( TRP ) superfamily cation channel . TRPV1 primarily express sensory nerve activate heating ( &gt; 43Â°C ) wide range chemical stimulus . One chemical stimulus capsaicin , pungent ingredient hot chilli pepper . The effect bind exogenous ligand capsaicin TRPV1 receptor well know provoke release number bioactive substance include calcitonin gene-related peptide ( CGRP ) . These substance , turn , act target cell surround tissue mast cell , immune cell vascular smooth muscle cell . The result response characterize redness warmth ( secondary vasodilatation ) , swell ( secondary plasma extravasation ) allodynia ( i.e . hypersensitivity heat touch secondary alteration excitability primary sensory neuron ) . The present study want test follow hypothesis : ( ) The DBF response topical apply capsaicin decrease cystinosis patient , compare match control subject . ( ii ) The skin sensitivity response topical apply capsaicin decrease cystinosis patient , compare match control subject . ( iii ) The temperature sensitivity decrease cystinosis patient , compare match control subject .</brief_summary>
