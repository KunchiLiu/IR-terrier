	<brief_summary>This research seek develop culturally-acceptable , effective , sustainable way utilize rapidly grow penetration mobile phone among people Sub-Saharan Africa ( SSA ) , improve currently poor control hypertension among patient high risk future stroke . It also aim develop human capital SSA conduct locally-relevant , high-quality stroke research future . Specifically , study preliminarily test strategy incorporates mobile phone texting home blood pressure monitoring direct trained nurse , improve patient adherence proven medical therapy treat hypertension .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Uncoordinated care shortage physicians limit capacity country Sub-Saharan Africa ( SSA ) implement effective sustainable control hypertension routine clinical practice . Of various cardiovascular disease entity , none strongly link hypertension stroke . Recent estimate indicate death stroke low-income middle-income country ( LMIC ) account roughly 4 5 stroke-related death worldwide , disability adjust life year lose country almost seven time lose high-income country ( HIC ) . Most LIMC SSA . Moreover , give transition primarily infectious condition chronic non-communicable disease , burden stroke SSA likely increase substantially next several decade . Fortunately , proper control hypertension , incidence mortality stroke greatly reduce , recently witness several HIC . Despite immense burden stroke , SSA low density neurologist worldwide , situation exacerbate migration provider researcher industrialized country . Thus , urgent priority SSA develop human capital region investigate enhance stroke outcomes partner establish researcher . The theoretically-based Phone-based Intervention Nurse Guidance Stroke ( PINGS ) intervention comprise protocol-driven mHealth technology ( remote home blood pressure monitor mobile phone texting ) guidance nurse navigator , among patient hypertension experience recent stroke ( within one month symptom onset ) Kumasi , Ghana . In Phase 1 , investigator conduct 3-month feasibility randomize trial 6-month follow-up among 60 stroke patient uncontrolled hypertension , randomly assign standard care PINGS . The investigator assess key methodological parameter , consumer response , clinical outcome include recruitment retention rate , intervention use , patient/provider satisfaction , real time medication adherence rate , medication possession ratio , post-discharge clinic blood pressure level . In Phase 2 , investigator triangulate data Phase 1 refine optimize PINGS prepare full-scale future efficacy/ effectiveness randomize clinical trial . Throughout PINGS , researcher United States mentor co-investigators Ghana impart knowledge develop mHealth research capacity . Successful completion PINGS lead cadre investigator Ghana knowledgeable clinical research methodology , experienced execution innovative , contextualized research target stroke .</detailed_description>
