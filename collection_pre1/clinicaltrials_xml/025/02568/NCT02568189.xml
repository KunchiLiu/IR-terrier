	<brief_title>Utility Ultrasound Assessment Inferior Vena Cava Patients With Sepsis Dehydration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ultrasound widely accept highly useful clinical tool . It carry additional advantage rapid , painless non-radiating . It long use assess cardiac output vascular pathology . More recently emergency trauma clinician use assess hydration status , shock/sepsis state fluid responsiveness . Using sonography look inferior vena cava give clinician rapid view vascular collapsibility previously demonstrate correlate mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) central venous pressure ( CVP ) . Previously , Jones et . al . complete RCT adult great age 17 evaluate goal direct utility early versus delay inferior vena cava sonography patient present non traumatic hypotension emergency department . This study find improve outcomes accuracy diagnostic etiology undergo immediate IVC imaging . The study conduct randomize controlled trial IVC Ultrasonography pediatric patient 0-21 year age . Patients admit Emergency Department trigger triage STOP SEPSIS ALERT ( base triage vital sign chief complaint ) , vomit require zofran diarrhea concern dehydration/hypovolemia , treat physician believe would benefit intravenous fluid , eligible inclusion study . The `` treating physician '' refers one Pediatric Emergency Medicine attending fellow , list co-investigators . Only patient parent express interest participate study , attend fellow care patient determine patient eligible . If patient eligible , criterion would exclude study , write informed consent obtain guardian assent obtain child &gt; 7 year old . The patient enrol study randomize either immediate ultrasonography group ( Ultrasound ( US ) Inferior Vena Cava ( IVC ) first clinician fully assess patient place rehydration order ) control group ( US 15 minute assessment management patient ) . The goal ass use ultrasound impact clinical management outcomes patient present pediatric emergency department sepsis dehydration .</detailed_description>
