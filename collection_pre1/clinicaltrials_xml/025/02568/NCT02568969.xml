	<detailed_description>The combination coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) , repair valve pathology and/or valve replacement remain challenge high-risk aspect current cardiosurgical practice . Direct indirect result surgery affect variety factor include patient 's age , general condition , preoperative severity heart dysfunction remodeling , etc . In addition , result operation may hamper unexpected anatomic technical feature influence surgical approach well duration cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) aortic cross clamping , anesthesia , intensive care respiratory support . The combined complex cardiac surgery require CPB , , parallel increase duration intervention , induces systemic inflammatory response ischemia-reperfusion injury . These pathophysiological mechanism include activation cytokine , complement , neutrophil , monocyte , endothelium platelet . Neutrophil sequestration vital organ response chemotaxis release reactive oxygen specie inflammatory mediator may result tissue hypoperfusion multiple organ dysfunction syndrome , contribute development postoperative complication adverse outcomes . To alleviate CPB-induced systemic inflammatory response organ-specific injury , different intervention exist , include meticulous hemodynamic metabolic monitoring follow goal-directed therapy . Several recent study group author clearly demonstrate beneficial effect approach cardiac surgery . In setting , extraction O2 cellular level may severely disturb , complex analysis change tissue perfusion oxygenation adjust therapy may useful . Current technique continuous monitoring lactate use Eirus system potential broaden knowledge clinical scenario reinforce decision-making high-risk cardiac surgery . Hence , continuous measurement lactate may valuable adjunct routine hemodynamic parameter blood gas , facilitate change fluid therapy inotrope/vasopressor support achievement adequate balance oxygen demand delivery . Combination continuously measure lactate monitoring cardiac output , mixed central venous saturation Pv-aCO2 seem attractive approach `` global view '' systemic oxygen transport bedside . Recently , continuous monitoring lactate validate pilot clinical study cardiosurgical patient mostly isolated CABG aortic valve replacement relatively short-term CPB , however ' role combine cardiac surgery prolong CPB , represent important set lactate-guided therapy , remain unsettled . Thus , aim study ass use continuous monitoring lactate high-risk combined/complex cardiac surgery .</detailed_description>
