The curative treatment modality HCC surgery , local ablation , liver transplantation high recurrence rate either due viral hepatitis infection cirrhosis lead low success rate high economic burden.. Unfortunately , majority patient unresectable disease diagnosis . So , patient search palliative expensive therapy include chemotherapy radiotherapy often fail eradicate tumor lesion completely tend result many adverse events.Thus , novel approach treatment option need patient advanced HCC . In recent year , immunotherapy emerge efficacious treatment modality encourage efficacy slight adverse event cancer therapy . Cytokine-induced killer CIK cell therapy evaluate adoptive cell immunotherapy cancer patient number clinical trial promise efficacy CIK cell malignancy prove . . Clinical study demonstrate excellent method prevent tumor recurrence preliminarily show efficacy inhibit recurrence metastasis primary HCC -Peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) patient primary HCC incubate vitro induce CIK cell presence various cytokine interferon-gamma ( IFN-Ã£ ) , interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) , IL-2 , monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) CD3 . CIK cell infusion perform Once every week , total least4infusions . Infusion give intrahepatic via peripheral vein . The serial biological event follow CIK cell administration cancer patient include ( ) immune activation effective lymphocyte ( mostly C D3+CD 5 6+Tlymphocytes ) proliferation start early first administration , ( b ) clinically measurable antitumor effect mediate activate immune cell week month , ( c ) potential delayed effect patient survival several month even longer first administration . Our team many grant field HCC biomarkers discovery management NIH multicenter study get many international publication . As well grant use laboratory technique cultivation stem cell specialized cell use treatment different disease get publication era . aim project cultivate patient cell vitro get CIK cell study safety efficacy immunization specific antihepatocellular carcinoma Cytokine -induced killer cell Egyptian patient advance hepatocellular carcinoma treatment adjuvant treatment comparison traditional treatment .</detailed_description>
