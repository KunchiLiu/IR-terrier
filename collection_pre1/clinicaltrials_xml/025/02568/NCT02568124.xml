	<brief_summary>BACKGROUND Chronic subdural hematoma ( CSDH ) one frequent reason cranial neurosurgical consult . There widely accept medical treatment CSDH . This trial investigate whether Tranexamic Acid ( TXA ) increase rate CSDH resolution follow conservative management , low number require surgical procedure decrease rate CSDH recurrence follow surgical evacuation . TRACS double blind , randomize , parallel-design , placebo-controlled , phase IIB study design provide preliminary efficacy data well feasibility , safety incidence data require plan large definitive phase III trial . METHODS Consecutive patient present Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Sherbrooke recent ( &lt; 14 day ) diagnosis subdural hematoma chronic component screen eligibility . Exclusion criterion include specific risk factor thromboembolic disease , anticoagulant use contraindication TXA . A total 130 patient randomize receive either 750 mg TXA daily placebo complete radiological resolution CSDH maximum 20 week . CSDH volume measure serial CT scanning . Cognitive function test , quality life questionnaire well functional autonomy assessment perform enrollment , 10 week follow-up 3 month post-treatment follow-up . During treatment period , patient undergo standard CSDH management surgery perform discretion treat physician . If surgery perform , CSDH outer membrane sample vitro analysis . The primary outcome rate CSDH resolution 20 week without intervene unplanned surgical procedure . Secondary outcome include CSDH volume , incidence surgical evacuation procedure , CSDH recurrence , cognitive function , functional autonomy , quality life , incidence complication length hospital stay . Planned subgroup analyse perform conservatively vs surgically-managed subject highly vs poorly vascularise CSDH . DISCUSSION CSDH frequent morbid condition effective medical treatment yet discover . The TRACS trial first prospective study TXA CSDH .</brief_summary>
