	<brief_summary>This phase IIA trial study well recombinant human papillomavirus nonavalent work prevent human papilloma virus ( HPV ) young healthy participant . HPV common virus usually cause infection last month , sometimes last long time cause cancer cervix , vagina , vulva , anus oropharynx many year among adult . Recombinant human papillomavirus nonavalent vaccine type nonavalent vaccine ( vaccine work nine different virus microorganism ) may protect HPV infection health problem HPV infection cause .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine persistence stability serologic geometric mean titer ( GMT ) HPV 16/18 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 month prime dose prior administration second dose . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine persistence stability serologic GMT HPV type 6/11/31/33/45/52/58 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 month prime dose prior administration second dose . II . To assess safety reactogenicity vaccine dose . OUTLINE : Participants receive recombinant human papillomavirus nonavalent vaccine intramuscularly ( IM ) baseline ( prim injection ) 24 30 month ( booster injection ) . After completion study , patient follow 2 week .</detailed_description>
