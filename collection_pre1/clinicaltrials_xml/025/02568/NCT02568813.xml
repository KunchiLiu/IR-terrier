	<brief_summary>Epilepsy multifaceted disorder major public health problem . In addition recurrent unpredictable seizure , abnormality psychiatric status , cognition social-adaptive behavior potential major source disability child adult epilepsy disorder . Recent study unequivocally document raise psychiatric comorbidities child epilepsy , particularly emotional regulation disorder depression anxiety , compare general population child medical disorder , neurological non-neurological . A prevalence 12 % 35 % report , compare 3-8 % general population . Major advance begin uncover potential mediator emotional regulation disorder social comorbidities epilepsy , important gap remain early detection , treatment prevention disorder . A small number investigation examine child epilepsy near time diagnosis . This time effect chronic epilepsy , potential averse social effect epilepsy , complicate aetiological effect minimize . Epilepsy syndromes provide useful framework consider risk type emotional dysregulation comorbidities . But variability within across syndrome needs take account thus require strict phenotyping specialist file pediatric epileptology . Retrospective study , usually include patient chronic epilepsy suffer mixed spectrum epilepsy syndrome introduce bias lead rather disparate finding . Are disorder result common physiopathological mechanism , precede development epilepsy ? The link underlie brain disorder psychiatric comorbidities emerge recent literature , evidence base study adult , suggest bidirectional relation epilepsy neurobehavioural comorbidities . Emotional regulation disorder follow onset epilepsy , also precede , thus serve possible risk factor . The clinical implication bidirectional association neurobehavioural comorbidities might present diagnosis even epilepsy onset . There need great understanding cause condition young people . The degree specific epilepsy syndrome associate relative risk emotional dysregulation disorder child new- recent-onset ( within six month prior enrolment ) rarely comprehensively examined represent focus current investigation . The investigator study base prospectively recruit cohort 280 children/adolescents recently diagnose epilepsy . All participate centre dispose necessary competence precise diagnosis epilepsy syndromes tool per case appropriate aetiology screen . Following first seizure child usually first examine hospital base emergency department . Prompt referral epilepsy team participate present study significantly reduce population bias shortcuts encountered study recruit patient chronic epilepsy follow tertiary care epilepsy unit . The investigator expect result provide great understanding share unique feature emotional regulation disorder , relation specific epilepsy category define basis underlie physiopathological mechanism . Such knowledge also assist clinician family plan diagnosis management resource .</brief_summary>
