	<brief_summary>Platelets increasingly recognize potent ubiquitously present source inflammatory activation . Importantly , antiplatelet therapy show significantly reduce major adverse event renal injury cardiac surgery patient . However , current practice , concern excessive bleeding—not platelet activation thrombosis—shape clinical decision . The investigator recently see , significant drop platelet number follow cardiac surgery associate increase mortality risk acute kidney injury . The investigator hypothesize thrombocytopenia result excessive perioperative platelet activation resultant release inflammatory tissue injurious signal activate platelet . Platelet activation characterize cardiac surgery examine correlation inflammatory response perioperative end-organ injury .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Distant organ injury frequent consequence cardiovascular surgery involve cardio-pulmonary bypass . Acute kidney injury ( AKI ) , common complication , occur 30 % -40 % cardiac surgery patient , even moderate damage , significantly increase mortality healthcare cost . Although organ injury link inflammation , mechanisms initiate propagate event remain poorly define . As median age medical complexity cardiac patient increase , challenge - opportunity - improve organ protection lie identify modifiable target . The investigator preliminary work provide primary evidence activate platelet play novel role initiation tissue injurious inflammatory response microvascular interface . As , platelet aggregate close proximity perivascular mast cell , cell type rapidly launch powerful inflammatory response release preform effector . Platelet activation alone sufficient stimulate mast cell vitro , conversely , pharmacological inhibition platelet reduce mast cell-dependent inflammation end organ injury rat circulatory arrest . Based compelling experimental data evidence human relevance , investigator form central hypothesis platelet activation important trigger inflammatory tissue injurious response cardiopulmonary bypass stimulation perivascular mast cell . The objective define pathophysiologic relevance platelet/mast cell interaction end organ injury , identify target novel strategy organ protection cardiac surgery patient . Specific Aim : Define platelet activation risk factor end organ injury cardiac surgery patient . The investigator preliminary data strongly suggest thrombocytopenia cardiac surgery link AKI increase mortality . In prospective study 100 patient undergoing coronary artery bypass graft ( CAGB ) surgery , investigator define platelet activation consumption likely cause thrombocytopenia , establish association platelet activation general marker mast cell activation , systemic inflammation , AKI . Approach : The objective aim investigate link perioperative platelet activation , systemic inflammatory response , adverse end organ outcome . The investigator perform prospective observational study 100 patient investigate link perioperative platelet activation , systemic inflammatory response , end organ injury follow cardiac surgery . Patient inclusion criterion study base result retrospective study 4201 patient undergo CABG surgery CPB . Here , investigator identify significant incidence thrombocytopenia association thrombocytopenia increase risk develop postoperative AKI . Consequently , propose study design determine whether postoperative platelet activation contribute systemic inflammatory response , hence , causative effect end organ injury . Sample collection processing : 15 mL venous blood drawn ACD buffer incision 10 minute , 6 , 24 , 48 , 72 hour separation cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) . Measurements : The investigator analyze serum platelet marker enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) characteristic change membrane protein expression multicolor Fluorescence-activated cell sort ( FACS ) . Corresponding platelet count determine time point . Aspirin medication give day surgery start postoperative day 2 standard care . Because aspirin resistance may influence outcome , investigator measure 11-dehydrothromboxane B2 urine level . Ensuing subgroup analysis establish relevance aspirin resistance observation . Systemic inflammation examine determine plasma cytokine level ELISA . As additional arm investigation investigator collect patient DNA platelet RNA examine genomic characteristic platelet gene expression profile associate enhanced platelet activation surgery . This data inform study personalize identification risk factor patient undergo cardiac surgery . Primary outcome : AKI clinically relevant manifestation end organ injury serve primary outcome . With incidence 30 % -40 % follow cardiac surgery , investigator expect observe sufficient number case AKI allow adequate statistical analysis . The investigator define AKI accord Kidney Disease : Improving Global Outcomes ( KDIGO ) criterion record AKI use propose stage change serum creatinine value 3 day 10 day surgery date . Secondary outcome : The investigator measure cytokine expression platelet activation secondary outcome . Further , investigator also collect establish measure clinical outcome hospital length stay , ICU length stay , duration postoperative mechanical ventilation , major adverse cardiac event ( MACE ) define all-cause mortality , emergent revascularization , atrial fibrillation , stroke , non-fatal myocardial infarction . Patient characteristic number , power-analysis , patient Data collection : Variables record patient file : 1 ) preoperatively : age , gender , race , Society Thoracic Surgery risk factor , EUROScore , date consent , preoperative drug ; 2 ) intraoperatively : number coronary artery bypass graft , duration cardio-pulmonary bypass , duration aortic cross clamp , cumulative dose heparin administer , blood product , cumulative dose sympathomimetic vasopressor drug ; 3 ) postoperatively : timing complication , cause time death , hospital ICU length stay , duration postoperative mechanical ventilation , dose inotropic vasoactive support . Plate-let count creatinine level , well anti-platelet therapy record 3 day be-fore 10 day surgery . Expected Outcomes . In Aim , investigator expect provide new insight origins systemic inflammation end organ injury follow cardiac surgery . Our preliminary data indicate postoperative thrombopenia associate AKI mortality . The investigator expect demonstrate thrombocytopenia occur set ongoing platelet activation associate systemic inflammation , ultimately , end organ injury . Together , investigation lay foundation novel organ protection strategy cardiac surgery . Statistical analysis . Descriptive comparison make use Kruskal-Wallis test chi-square test , appropriate . Univariable multivariable linear logistic regression analysis apply , appropriate , evaluate association primary secondary outcome pre- , intra- , postoperative variable . R2 linear regression analysis , odds ratio , correspond 95 % confidence limit logistic regression analyse re-ported .</detailed_description>
