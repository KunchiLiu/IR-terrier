	<brief_summary>26 participant Orthodontic Department University Damascus Dental School randomly assign two group . In experimental group , low level laser wave length 830 nm , output 150 mw , energy 2 j per point application time 15 second per point apply tooth six upper incisor accord protocol : root divide 2 half ; gingival cervical . Laser apply center half buccal palatal side mean 4 application point total energy 8 j per tooth . Control group undergo typical orthodontic treatment laser device apply manner without turn ( get placebo effect pain reduction effect ) . This procedure repeat 3 , 7 , 14 day 15 day begin second month till end leveling alignment stage .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Low Level Laser Therapy Accelerating Tooth Movement For Dental Crowding Cases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The long time need orthodontic treatment consider one big obstacle make patient refuse undergo treatment . It also many disadvantage include high caries rate , gingivitis , root resorption . It also combine commonly pain , reduce patient acceptance cooperation treatment . Low level laser therapy orthodontic show pain-reducing effect effect biomodulation lead increase orthodontic tooth movement rate reduce risk root resorption . A recent systematic review state low level laser therapy show efficiency accelerate orthodontic tooth movement , need study determine best protocol regard energy frequency . A review literature show randomize control trail evaluate efficiency accelerate orthodontic tooth movement regard dental crowding case , main purpose study .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1 . Patients age ( 16 24 ) year . 2 . Moderate crowding ( 3 5 ) mm anterior region maxillary dental arch irregularity index ( 7 mm ) mm accord Little Index indication extract upper two premolar . 3 . All upper teeth exist ( except third molar ) . 4 . Patients undergone previous orthodontic treatment . 5 . Patients undergone medical treatment interfere orthodontic tooth movement ( Cortisone , NSAIDs , â€¦ ) . 6 . Patient good oral hygiene ( Plaque Index less 1 ) . 1 . Any medical condition affect orthodontic tooth movement . 2 . Bad oral hygiene ( Plaque Index great 1 ) . 3 . Any periapical lesion develop treatment . 4 . Patient lack commitment toward followup appointment .</criteria>
