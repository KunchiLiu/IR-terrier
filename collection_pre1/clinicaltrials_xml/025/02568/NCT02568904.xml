	<brief_title>Alcohol Consumption With Without Multispecies Probiotic</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Alcohol binge drinking , define 5 drink men 4 drink woman one time , frequent form alcohol consumption worldwide , especially young people . This drinking pattern popular lead increase mortality morbidity . Therefore binge drink major public health issue . The behavioural neurological consequence binge drink well characterize . Less known systemic effect gut first organ contact alcohol . Chronic alcohol intake lead increase gut permeability , bacterial translocation alteration gut microbiome animal model . Recently bacterial translocation show healthy volunteer single alcohol binge . On immune cell , acute alcohol intake seem dichotomous effect . On one hand immunosuppressive anti-inflammatory effect describe , however , alcohol induce liver injury drive pro-inflammatory reaction . These immune effect seem drive endotoxin bacterial product via Toll-like receptor translocate circulation via defective gut barrier . Immune effect alcohol also link hangover symptom alcohol binge . Furthermore evidence endotoxemia might also contribute alcohol dependence promote prolong increase voluntary alcohol intake mouse . On hand mutant mouse lack important gene immune response exhibit decreased alcohol consumption . This indicate immune signal promotes alcohol consumption . Therefore tempt speculate increase gut permeability lead increase bacterial translocation acute alcohol binge could promote desire alcohol consumption . Based finding method decrease bacterial translocation restore gut barrier function would interest prevent harmful effect binge drinking . The use living microorganism ( probiotic ) balance agent intestine say restore intestinal barrier function increase epithelial resistance , inhibit mast-cell activation , tight junction opening , pro-inflammatory cytokine release induce secretion ( anti-inflammatory ) interleukin ( IL ) 10 . Furthermore probiotic increase activation alkaline phosphatase gut thereby directly decrease endotoxin-load . The investigator therefore hypothesize concomitant use probiotic binge drinking able restore gut barrier , decrease bacterial translocation immune dysfunction decrease hangover symptom . Such strategy might also decrease desire drink alcohol . The investigator aim test hypothesis double-blind , placebo control , cross-over clinical trial healthy volunteer undergo episode binge drinking without probiotic supplementation study .</detailed_description>
