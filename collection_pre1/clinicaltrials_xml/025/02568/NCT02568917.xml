	<brief_summary>Background : Dental caries still public health problem among Brazilian child doubt still exist regard effective restorative technique . The aim pragmatic randomize clinical trial evaluate effectiveness single multiple-surfaces restoration perform follow Atraumatic Restorative Treatment ( ART ) premise compare Conventional Treatment ( CT ) primary permanent teeth . Methods : A total 1,214 5-to-13 years-old child least one single multiple-surface dentin caries lesion primary permanent molar select public school Barueri-SP . The participant randomly divide 2 group : CT ( Filtek Bulk Fill - 3M ) ART ( Ketac Molar Easy Mix - 3M ) treat ten untrained dentist dental office inside school . The restoration evaluate 6 , 12 24 month independent train calibrated examiner . The restoration tooth survival , cost-effectiveness analysis two group operator preference treatment regard technique also evaluate . Kaplan-Meier survival analysis log-rank test apply survival restoration . All average event rate two group model compare Cox proportional hazard share frailty model since operator cluster-effect .

The significance level analyse 5 % . Discussion : Our hypothesis despite similar expect effectiveness ART use high viscosity GIC conventional treatment use composite resin treat single multiple-surface posterior primary permanent teeth , ART present superior cost-effectiveness . The result trial support decision-making clinician policy maker Keywords : atraumatic restorative treatment , composite resin , glass ionomer cement , randomize clinical trial , cost effectiveness analysis</detailed_description>
