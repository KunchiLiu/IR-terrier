	<brief_title>Stereotactic Radiosurgery Systemic Dose Chemotherapy Locally Advanced Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current standard care treatment locally advance ( unresectable stage II stage III ) non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) chemo-radiation consist 7 week radiation chemotherapy give reduce dose ( opposed systemic dose chemotherapy give ) . While outcomes improved time remain humbling , current approach associate overall poor result term local ( 30 % patient local failure ) distant control ( 40 % patient distant failure ) median overall survival 17 month . This study evaluate treatment full dose chemotherapy stereotactic body radiotherapy ( SBRT ) . SBRT use high dos radiation precise conformal manner , number treatment much reduce versus conventional radiation ( SBRT would able complete 2 week less ) . The biologically effective dose SBRT much high conventional radiation ; despite short number treatment effective radiation dose high . SBRT would complete 2 week since radiation would complete short time span , would allow patient high ( systemic ) chemotherapy dos . The purpose study explore SBRT addition systemic dos chemotherapy treatment locally advance NSCLC .</detailed_description>
