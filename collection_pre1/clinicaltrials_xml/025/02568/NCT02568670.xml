	<brief_title>Removal Peripheral Intravenous Catheters According Clinical Signs Every 96 Hours : A Non Inferiority Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The care practice standard relate infusion therapy ( IT ) stipulate regulated US institution , Infusion Nurses Society ( INS ) Center Disease Control ( CDC ) , , Brazil , Brazilian National Health Surveillance Agency ( ANVISA ) . Within topic , investigator mention peripherally administer IT peripheral intravenous catheter ( PIC ) use one , since less complex less invasive , offer low risk severe complication compare central line IT . PIC placement , maintenance removal procedure free complication , order prevent , regulatory agency publish formal recommendation . One refers time PIC remain site ( residence time ) , determine 96 hour adult population , i.e. , remove puncture another site , systematically , even show inflammatory sign within 96 hour . Following literature review , one see recommendation base limited evidence , support data old study . For reason , investigator discuss employ systematic elective change procedure adult would best option , investigator take aspect consideration , : Patient safety - The PIC dwell time placement site , show research result , increase throughout decade 24 , 48 , 72 , 96 hour . If PIC change perform child , theoretically , less immune-competent patient compare adult , perform accord clinical sign , investigator conclude adopt procedure adult would safe . Peripheral venous depletion - Logic lead u consider less investigator puncture patient , access available , less outcomes IT-specific complication occur . Patient satisfaction - With reduced exposure painful invasive event , patient also benefit . Few patient refrain show dissatisfaction PIC place electively . Quality - Producing scientific evidence adopt best practice hospital environment practice quality . Economic aspects - If PIC change less frequent , would necessarily imply less spending input device , well less time spend team perform procedure , represent less cost workload . Occupational safety - Studies show estimate relationship occurrence accident biological material perform invasive procedure . Reducing number puncture perform professional , addition decrease workload , may reduce exposure risk accident . Research study carry mostly Australia aim show systematic PIC removal change bring benefit , compare change base clinical manifestation . However , systematic review study 2010 find conclusive evidence , suggest development project several region , different nature reality , mature hypothesis . To support , INS also formally state theme research priority time .</detailed_description>
