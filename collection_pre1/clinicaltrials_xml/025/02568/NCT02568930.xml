	<detailed_description>The purpose study compare health-related quality life ( HRQOL ) outcomes old ( 60-80 year ) advance heart failure ( HF ) patient undergo heart transplantation ( HT ) mechanical circulatory support ( MCS ) permanent implant ( i.e. , destination therapy [ DT ] ) caregiver , risk factor poor HRQOL , adverse event symptom burden , quality-adjusted life year ( QALYs ) . Advanced HF patient , 60-80 year age , appropriate target group study receive HTs MCS device frequently , despite great risk poor clinical outcome , acceptable rate survival . Using prospective , longitudinal design , multi-site comparative effectiveness research compare HRQOL outcomes patient receive HT DT MCS caregiver , baseline 2 year post-operatively . The primary aim propose study determine whether old advanced HF patient undergo DT MCS , compare patient undergo HT , experience non-inferior change overall HRQOL ( primary ) , domains HRQOL ( physical , mental , social ) baseline 2 year surgery . Secondary Aims ( 1 . ) determine whether caregiver older advanced HF patient undergo DT MCS , compare caregiver older advanced HF patient undergo HT , experience non-inferior change overall HRQOL domains baseline 2 year surgery ; ( 2.-3 . ) identify risk factor related poor overall HRQOL old DT MCS patient caregiver , compare old HT patient caregiver , 2 year surgery ; ( 4 . ) determine whether old advanced HF patient undergo DT MCS , compare patient undergo HT , non-inferior rate freedom adverse event &amp; symptom 1 2 year surgery ; ( 5 ) evaluate distribution QALYs older advance HF patient undergo DT MCS , compare patient undergo HT 2 year surgery . Our propose study contribute well patient-centered care older advanced HF patient caregiver , inform decision make guide strategy enhance post-operative HRQOL .</detailed_description>
