	<brief_title>A Study Assess Safety Hep C Vaccine Candidates HIV Seropositive Individuals</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatitis C ( Hep C ) common infection . Worldwide , 180 million people infected . Hep C blood borne viral infection spread direct contact blood infect person . People Hep C frequently symptoms infection lead fibrosis ( scar liver ) , liver failure cancer . Infection Hep C virus ( HCV ) progress rapidly liver damage Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) -infected individual . Researchers University Oxford develop novel candidate vaccine HCV ( 'NSmut ' ) . This vaccine insert carrier virus Chimpanzee Adenovirus 3 ( AdCh3 ) modify vaccinia virus Ankara ( MVA ) , excellent safety record previously test people . However , objective study use exploratory immunological assay ass whether vaccine Hep C induce immune response HIV positive individual similar strength healthy volunteer .</detailed_description>
