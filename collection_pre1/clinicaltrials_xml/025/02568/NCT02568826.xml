	<detailed_description>The purpose trial evaluate Phase 2 A study , analgesic tolerability , safety activity IDN 5243 ( 3-glycosyl-3-O-demethylthiocolchicine derivative ) administer intramuscularly 4mg b.i.d . 5 day subject Low Back Pain ( LBP ) . IDN 5243 ( 3-glycosyl-3-O-demethylthiocolchicine derivative ) new muscle relaxant molecule prepared synthesis D-xylose 3-O-demethylthiocolchicine . The primary outcome study evaluate systemic safety ( vital sign , laboratory evaluation incidence adverse event ) study drug assess Investigator take consideration change baseline DAY 5 , local tolerability assess patient every day treatment period Investigator . The secondary objective study evaluate analgesic activity study drug . Analgesic activity evaluate score spontaneous pain . In particular , secondary outcome trial change Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS Scale ) score ( 100 mm ) evaluate baseline DAY 5 ( Visit V5 ) . Moreover , evaluation secondary parameter analgesic activity change quality life assess . Patients perform total 6 visit : 5 visit treatment duration ( day 1 - day 5 ) Follow-up visit ( day 12 ) perform 7 day end treatment ( ± 2 day event visit occur Sunday ) .</detailed_description>
