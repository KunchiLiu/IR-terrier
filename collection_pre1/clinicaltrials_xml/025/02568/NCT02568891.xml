	<brief_summary>In end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) cardiovascular infectious complication common . The gut microbiome might play important pathophysiological role . ESRD hypothesize associate profound alteration gut microbiome gut permeability . The investigator aim test whether multispecies probiotic mixture able revert microbiome change decrease gut permeability . Furthermore investigator aim test whether improvement microbiome composition gut permeability also associate improvement endotoxemia , uremia cardiovascular risk factor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) prevalence 10 % general population 20 % high-risk group , patient diabetes . Despite widespread availability renal replacement therapy western world , mortality patient end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) still high . The life expectancy patient renal replacement therapy Austria reduce 50 % . Patients renal replacement therapy exhibit increase cardiovascular mortality ( 10-30 fold high general population ) associate accelerated vascular calcification . The KIDNEY DISEASE IMPROVING GLOBAL OUTCOMES ( KDIGO ) -work group introduce term CKD-Mineral Bone Disorder ( CKD-MBD ) describe clinical syndrome encompass mineral , bone , calcific cardio-vascular abnormality develop complication CKD . This syndrome emerge result decline kidney function characterize change circulate level parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) , 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25 ( OH ) D ) ,1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D ( 1,25 ( OH ) 2D ) , vitamin D metabolite fibroblast growth factor-23 ( FGF-23 ) . The ability fail kidney excrete phosphate diminish hyperphosphatemia occurs . High phosphate level together calcium well low concentration fetuin A , main calcification inhibitor physiological condition , lead increase vascular extravascular calcification renal bone disease . Another important calcification inhibitor vitamin K2-dependent matrix Gla-protein ( MGP ) . Dialysis patient exhibit low vitamin K intake suffer substantially vitamin K deficiency . Insufficient vitamin K intake lead production non-carboxylated , inactive MGP deficiency carboxylate MGP may contribute substantially development progression arterial calcification . Bacterial infection sepsis , although decrease last decade , also account 20 % deaths ESRD-patients second common cause mortality hospitalization . Mortality due sepsis 100 - 300 time high dialysis patient compare general population . The mechanism increase susceptibility infection unclear recent study suggest patient ESRD , innate immune response defective . One reason defective innate immunity might lie increase risk endotoxemia . Hemodialysis ( HD ) -induced regional splanchnic ischemia lead increase gut permeability consecutive endotoxin translocation . This possibly result alteration gut microbiome composition . Recently profound alteration composition gut microbiome ESRD show . In ESRD subject , Firmicutes , Actinobacteria Proteobacteria few Sutterellaceae , Bacteroidaceae , Lactobacillaceae observe relative control . The frequent use antibiotic , phosphate binder often polypragmatic drug consumption considerable impact microbiome ESRD-patients . These alteration gut microbiota impact several mechanism ESRD . Gut bacteria produce vitamin K microbiome composition might therefore play pivotal role provide enough vitamin K sufficient carboxylation MGP , potent inhibitor arterial calcification . Treatment vitamin K antagonist , example , associate 10 fold increase risk development calcification calciphylaxis , life threaten calcify arteriolopathy CKD-patients . Furthermore gut potential source endotoxin patient ESRD , due translocation bacterial product across gastrointestinal barrier . In ESRD presence endotoxin independent predictor mortality . Ultrafiltration hemodialysis treatment lead critical ischemia splanchnic vascular bed , thus adversely affect integrity gut barrier . Disruption gut barrier function ESRD allow translocation endotoxin bacterial metabolite systemic circulation , contribute inflammation uremia prompt progression disease . Furthermore , subclinical inflammation ESRD-patients show promote progression cardiovascular disease well . The gut microbiome also impact glucose metabolism play critical role obesity development insulin resistance type 2 diabetes . Protein fermentation gut microbiota generate toxic metabolite many know uremic toxin intestinal origin , include p-cresol indoxyl sulfate . Modulation microbiome contribute reduction/elimination uremic toxin . Improving poor prognosis ESRD patient ongoing challenge . An increased awareness limitation conventional dialysis technique renew interest alternative therapeutic recent year . An unmet clinical need adjuvant therapeutic strategy persist patient whether renal transplantation intend . Supplementation probiotic thereby target intestine , important source endotoxin uremic toxin , might promise approach partly overcome high morbidity mortality ESRD patient . Probiotics live beneficial microorganism , able gastroduodenal passage maintain viability throughout gut . Feasibility gut microbiome modulation ESRD show animal human setting . However , far , unknown extend probiotic able re-establish gut microbiome homeostasis ESRD . Furthermore effect probiotic intervention cardiovascular risk factor , inflammation , gut barrier uremia study detail yet .</detailed_description>
