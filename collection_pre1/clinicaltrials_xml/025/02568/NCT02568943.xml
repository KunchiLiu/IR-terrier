	<brief_summary>The purpose study provide oral panobinostat ( PAN ) treatment relapse relapsed refractory multiple myeloma patient without satisfactory treatment alternative prior commercial availability* reimbursement panobinostat regulatory approval process . This protocol acquire additional safety data use panobinostat combination bortezomib ( BTZ ) dexamethasone ( Dex ) patient relapse relapsed refractory multiple myeloma . In protocol , PAN must administer defined regimen combination BTZ DEX . * ( Note : throughout protocol `` commercially available '' mean local health authority approval functional method reimbursement )</brief_summary>
