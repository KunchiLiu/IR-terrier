	<brief_title>Nintedanib Treating Patients With Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma That Is Recurrent</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess 4-month progression-free survival ( PFS ) patient recurrent , unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma ( MAM ) treat nintedanib . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess response rate ( confirm unconfirmed , complete partial response ) disease control rate ( response stable disease ) subset patient measurable disease RECIST ( Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ) 1.1 criterion Modified RECIST criterion pleural tumor . II . To assess overall survival . III . To evaluate frequency severity toxicity associate treatment regimen . IV . To collect tissue sample future correlative study relate overall study objective . OUTLINE : Patients receive nintedanib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
