	<brief_title>Evaluation Onset Time DWP450-004 Safety Moderate-severe Glabellar Lines</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently , botulinum type A toxin related product use treatment area use often cosmetic area well frequency usage increase well . Daewoong Pharmaceutical Co. , Ltd. develop safe product identify wild-type Clostridium botulinum ( type A ) strain purify high purity , high quality botulinum toxin type A protein strain . As result characteristic analysis ( genotype analysis , morphological / biochemical characteristic verification test , toxicity test , etc ) identify fungi , confirmed biological chemicophysical property equal wild-type Clostridium botulinum ( type A , Hall strain ) . Regarding treatment satisfaction patient administer botulinum toxin product , onset time play important role factor . Limitation find review exist publication define onset time solely determination effect simply response whether improvement . However , study defines improvement rate glabellar line ratio reduction 1 point baseline investigator thus appear objective data obtain exist study . Therefore , background , intend conduct phase 4 clinical study explore onset time DWP450-004 injection 's glabellar line improvement effect .</detailed_description>
