	<detailed_description>This single-blinded randomized control trial evaluate effectiveness Arista hemostatic matrix powder ( Arista® AH , C. R. Bard , Inc. Davol , Warwick , RI ) reduce drainage output total thyroidectomy without lateral neck dissection . Increased drainage total thyroidectomy neck dissection wound bed lead seroma formation possible secondary infection , delay hospital discharge , additional home care need drain care . Arista inert plant base absorbable surgical hemostatic powder easily apply broad surgical field reduce bleed seroma rate . Therefore , application thyroidectomy neck dissection wound bed may bear significant potential benefit . Specific Aim 1 : The main hypothesis study use Arista total thyroidectomy without lateral neck dissection prior closure reduce postoperative drain outputs time drain removal compare total thyroidectomy without lateral neck dissection close without Arista . Specific Aim 2 : This study also evaluate secondary hypothesis Arista reduce postoperative hematoma seroma rate hospital length stay total thyroidectomy without lateral neck dissection . INTRODUCTION Total thyroidectomy increasingly common procedure perform entire thyroid gland remove either benign malignant disease . Common indication include multinodular goiter , Graves disease , thyroid carcinoma . Between 2006 2011 number total thyroidectomy perform United States increase 12 % per year , 45,558 72,344 accord American Cancer Society.1-2 In 2011 48,000 total thyroidectomy perform malignant disease often require additional lateral neck dissection.2 Although patient well total thyroidectomy 90 % 5-year survival patient well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma , total thyroidectomy without lateral neck dissection still carry potential serious complication include neck hematoma seromas . Postoperative fluid collection continue problematic thyroidectomy without lateral neck dissection hematoma rate 1-3 % seroma rate 4-7 % . 3-5 In order try reduce rate hematoma seromas total thyroidectomy without lateral neck dissection , majority surgeon place closed suction drain ( CSDs ) wind prior closure . Surgeons generally use drain attempt identify , reduce , prevent hematoma seromas even though little evidence support practice.3-5 At institution , common practice place single drain thyroid bed another drain neck lateral neck dissection preform remove drain output less 30ml 24-hour period 15ml 12-hour period downward trend . Meeting output volume criterion often take several day . Often , patient give decision discharge home drain wait continue inpatient hospitalization drain output requirement meet . Prolonged drain lead increase infection risk unnecessary hospital stay . According Healthcare Cost Utilization Project , average inpatient hospitalization 2009 cost $ 2,000 per day , increasing6 . The reduction average one hospital day per thyroidectomy patient could potential save $ 144,688,000 dollar year . An evaluation Arista use reduce drain output may reveal unnecessary expense relate increased hospital length stay could lead significant cost saving . Further , associate morbidity health care cost potential seroma infect seroma complication may avoid . According manufacturer , Arista use Microporous Polysaccharide Hemospheres ( MPH ) technology catalyze clot cascade effectively dehydrate tissue initiate hemostasis broad area . Major advantage Arista show safe effective across multiple surgical discipline , completely absorb 24-48 hour , contain human animal components.7-9 Sindwani et al . first report effectiveness safety Arista hemostatic agent otolaryngology demonstrate application control postoperative bleeding endoscopic sinus surgery.7 Zhang et al . demonstrated success rate 100 % prevention seromas patient undergo resection malignant tumor multiple location , include low extremity.8 Arista recently show useful reduce postoperative chest tube output hemostasis time patient undergo cardiothoracic surgery.9 These previous work support idea Arista could effective reduce postoperative fluid collection drainage time free flap donor site . However , would new application Arista wide applicability previously describe . Possible Influence On Clinical Practice Total thyroidectomy without lateral neck dissection , surgery general , evolve era increase attention quality life cost saving . The radical neck dissection increasingly replace focus `` functional '' `` selective '' neck dissection , spinal accessory nerve , sternocleidomastoid muscle , internal jugular vein , cervical sensory nerve preserve narrowly define set lymph node level excise , base oncologic risk profiling . Finding Arista decrease total thyroidectomy without lateral neck dissection drain output lead early drain removal could improve quality life patient , significantly decrease cost care , potentially decrease drain-associated infection . This study seek critically evaluate current clinical practice paradigm well understand potential benefit Arista post thyroidectomy without lateral neck dissection wound bed . A prospective , randomize , control , single-blinded trial clearest methodology evaluate possible limit bias confound variable . No clinical trial level perform topic ; thus , proposal novel finding study potentially important . SUBJECTS AND METHODS Patient Population Enrollment All adult patient ( 18 year old ) undergo total thyroidectomy without lateral neck dissection one two Head Neck Surgery faculty member UCSF include enrollment study consecutively register . Exclusion criterion consist patient age 18 , requirement postoperative anticoagulant medication routine deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis ( warfarin ) , presence clot bleed disorder . Approval intuitional review board ( IRB ) require prior initiation enrollment . Patients eligible inclusion IRB approve study approach study enrollment . Written consent discuss patient approve study investigator and/or research assistant . Further detail provide ( Section 3.0 Patient Selection ) . Study Protocols Surgical Description If successfully enrol study , randomize packet contain patient 's research ID number pull include patient 's chart . Randomization do initiation study create randomization list block stratification surgeon . An envelope contain patient randomize group assignment open end procedure prior closure . The patient randomize one four group . Groups 1 2 consist patient undergoing total thyroidectomy possible central neck dissection lateral neck dissection . Patients Group 1 3 gram Arista apply diffusely wound bed primary closure . Patients Group 2 Arista apply . Per routine , patient group single 10 French Jackson-Pratt drain place within thyroid bed remove per standardize protocol . Groups 3 4 consist patient undergoing total thyroidectomy lateral neck dissection . Patients Group 3 3 gram Arista apply diffusely thyroid neck wound bed primary closure . Patients Group 4 Arista apply . All incision close 3 layer 3-0 vicryl , 4-0 monocryl , 5-0 fast absorbing suture . All patient receive standardized postoperative order include inpatient antibiotic exceed 24hrs ( unless infection suspect ) DVT prophylaxis ; either weight base subcutaneous heparin enoxaparin . The drain remove output le 30ml per 24hr 15ml per 12hr downward trend . All patient receive similar postoperative instruction include wound care , without drain . If patient require drain remain time discharge , patient fully instruct drain care , empty , record . The patient see outpatient clinic , typically approximately 7 surgery , drain removed regardless output . A standardized physical exam perform patient every day inpatient stay chief resident postoperative appointment ( 5-8 day post-operatively ) attend surgeon evaluate clinical evidence seroma hematoma . Physical exam specifically include : 1 . Inspect palpate presence fluctuance . 2 . Inspect color change , erythema ecchymosis 3 . Palpate tenderness All patient give patient satisfaction questionnaire first postoperative visit evaluate overall satisfaction hospital stay , recovery healing wound , comfort home care , level pain . The validated questionnaire , measurement quality recovery ( QoR-40 ) , use . See outline Study Schema Figure 1 . Primary Endpoints Outcomes The primary outcome analyze study total drain output ( mL ) effort determine addition Arista wound bed decrease overall wound drainage drain output . Given drain output influence time drain removal , assessment make determine timing drain removal differs group . Secondary Endpoints Secondary outcome allow robust analysis include : 1 . Development hematoma . 2 . Development seroma . 3 . Requirement patient discharge drain . 4 . Hospital length stay . 5 . Need additional procedure secondary wind complication . 6 . The quantitative outcome patient satisfaction questionnaire</detailed_description>
