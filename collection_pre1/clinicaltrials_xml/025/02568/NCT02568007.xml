	<brief_title>Effects Cyproheptadine Growth Behavior Pediatric Feeding Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND , SIGNIFICANCE , AND RATIONALE Failure thrive inadequate weight gain frequent complaint amongst patient see general pediatrician pediatric gastroenterologist . The reason behind diagnosis vary widely include , limited feeding disorder diverse etiology , poor environmental structure inadequate intake , medication side effect , swallow disorder , variety underlie organic disease . For feed disorder , behavioral feed technique strategy increase caloric intake utilized correct suboptimal growth . However , feed disorder sometimes imprinted behavioral intervention may insufficient promote ideal growth , sufficient growth , inadequate help child avoid graduate nutritional support enteral tube . For reason , medication promote stimulate appetite weight gain frequently use child feed disorder . In pediatric gastroenterology practice , cyproheptadine commonly use drug appetite stimulation , weight gain , feed intolerance young child feed disorder . A first generation histamine serotonin antagonist , cyproheptadine think promote appetite stimulation weight gain increase insulin-like growth factor-1 ( IGF-1 ) concentration . It may also interact receptor ventromedial hypothalamus exert hormonal effect . While exact mechanism action still investigate , several study evaluate benefit cyproheptadine select patient group , include patient cystic fibrosis , cancer , undernourished child , child feed disorder . These study report cyproheptadine promotes weight gain stimulates appetite . Reported side effect cyproheptadine study primarily relate drowsiness tend significantly improve resolve within two week use . Another undesired effect development drug tolerance , i.e . tachyphylaxis . To avoid , common clinical practice cycle medication week month . While study report outcome use cyproheptadine child feed disorder failure thrive , study enrol small patient cohort randomize trial child enrol feeding team program . Two recent study examine role cyproheptadine patient undernourished follow pediatric feeding program . However , randomize study examine effect continuous cyproheptadine versus fix cycled medication dose versus abstain medication perform pediatric gastroenterology population . OUTCOME MEASURES : Number Participants Study : The total number patient require study 75 ( 25 group ) . The group consist three treatment arm : 1. continuous use cyproheptadine 2. cycle cyproheptadine 3. drug intervention This number derive look past statistical data study use similar power , alpha error , beta error . Investigators use Analysis Variance ( ANOVA ) analysis multiple group look repeat measure within factor . Alpha error 0.05 , Power 0.95 . Data Collection : The following category data collect ( see subsection list ) : medical record number ( MRN ) , demographic , feed behavior , side effect experience use cyproheptadine , 24 hour diet recall , medical history , anthropometrics . Demographic Information : Data collect part demographic questionnaire . This include participant 's age , sex , ethnicity , identification primary caretaker , caretaker 's relation participant , caretaker education level , caretaker marital status . Feeding Behavior Questionnaire : Patients/parents complete Mealtime Behavior Questionnaire ( MBQ ) . Participants ' guardian complete Mealtime Behavior Questionnaire ( MBQ ) . This validated , 31-item , parent-report questionnaire assess mealtime behavior structure young child 2 year . The questionnaire measure variables include : 1. food refusals/avoidance 2. food manipulation 3. mealtime aggression 4. choking/gagging/vomiting related meal . Each behavior assign frequency scale 1 correspond `` never '' 5 correspond `` always . '' The MBQ consist total score four subcategory score ( list ) . 24 Hour Diet Recall : Guardians participant question weekly regard oral intake ( type food consume amount ) past 24 hr . Caloric intake calculate base recall compare across duration study . Cyproheptadine Side Effect Questionnaire : Guardians undergo weekly questionnaire look common side effect cyproheptadine . A list side effect read participant 's guardian positive ( yes ) negative ( ) reply participant experience individual side effect since last survey . Medical Information : Data collect include anthropometrics initial final visit ( weight , height , BMI , mid-arm circumference , upper arm skin fold ) , current past medical diagnosis surgery , current medication , current gastrointestinal symptom , dependence tube feed RISK CATEGORY : Research involve great minimal risk child . KNOWN SIDE EFFECTS OF CYPROHEPTADINE : Cyproheptadine antihistamine antiserotonergic side effect related mechanism . These side effect include drowsiness sleepiness , confusion , excitement , fatigue , insomnia , hallucination , blur vision , tinnitus , dizziness , tachycardia , increase perspiration , appetite stimulation , weight gain , constipation , diarrhea , change frequency urination , thicken secretion , dry mucus membrane . Over-dosage result atropine-like effect well central nervous depression , convulsion . SECURITY OF DATA COLLECTED : All investigator receive Health Insurance Portability Accountability Act ( HIPAA ) train certificate completion Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative ( CITI ) train course protection human research subject start review . Information derive questionnaire , data collection compile one central data collection form . These form cod ( special identifier number link patient 's MRN ) . The central database use data collection password protect . A separate secure ( password protect ) database link cod number patient 's MRN . Only principal investigator ( PI ) , co-investigators member study team gathering data access study database . Paper record lock file cabinet within Gastroenterology office area electronic record store password-protected computer . Each subject 's identifying number relate electronic data keep secure , password-protected database provide access PI research staff . Only authorize research personnel access databases paper record . PROVISION FOR THE PROTECTION OF PRIVACY OF SUBJECTS ( confidentiality , health financial risk ) AND TO MAINTAIN THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF DATA : Data store Medical College Wisconsin secure share drive . PROVISIONS FOR MONITORING DATA TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF SUBJECTS ; AND ADDITIONAL SAFEGUARDS TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS AND WELFARE OF SUBJECTS WHO ARE LIKELY TO BE VULNERABLE : The PI monitor health patient study per standard clinical practice . Primary Co-investigators monitor protocol adherence supervise data collection , entry , analysis . ANTICIPATED BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROTOCOL ( value desire outcome / advantage ) TO HUMAN RESEARCH PARTICIPANTS AND SOCIETY ( medical , psychosocial , altruistic ) Anticipated direct benefit study include improvement appetite/behavior growth amongst patient receive cyproheptadine . These benefit may also present group abstain cyproheptadine due standard education give group . However , investigator anticipate benefit significantly low group compare patient cyproheptadine . Long-term benefit include creation utilization protocol outline use cyproheptadine feed team patient . The result study also address side effect profile cyproheptadine population . It may also investigators ' knowledge treatment approach successful , allow physician develop standardize care well serve patient family . STOPPING POINTS THAT WOULD NOT ALLOW THE STUDY TO CONTINUE AS PROPOSED : Stopping point study include achieve adequate information enough goal subject , inability obtain enough data , patients/caregivers elect discontinue study . DESCRIBE HOW THE CONSENT ( AND ASSENT , IF APPLICABLE ) PROCESS WILL TAKE PLACE . INCLUDE A LIST OF APPROPRIATELY TRAINED PERSONNEL WHO WILL BE INVOLVED . Written inform consent participation obtain guardian child 's participation . Consent obtain study personnel participant 's appointment GI Clinic . Participants ' consent allow access information collect program evaluation/clinical purpose . Participants ' guardian option consent document read aloud facilitate understanding . Copies sign consent document give participant ' guardian . Consent obtain study 's principal investigator , co-investigators , member research team . As additional research staff team member add , names submit International Review Board ( IRB ) protocol amendment allow obtain consent . PROCEDURES TO BE EMPLOYED IN ANALYZING DATA ( include power analysis ) AND THE ANTICIPATED SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROPOSED STUDY Analyses conduct Statistical Package Social Sciences ( SPSS ) Statistical Analysis System ( SAS ) software program . Probability level &lt; .05 use cut offs statistical significance . Descriptive analysis examine distribution normality extent parametric test assumption meet . Descriptive analyse also provide summary information participant characteristic . Pearson correlation use examine relationship continuous variable , chi square analyse examine association categorical variable . The key significance study analysis effect cyproheptadine stimulate weight gain improve behavior associate feed . In addition , help give clear comparison use continuous versus cycle cyproheptadine . Cyproheptadine suspect tachyphylaxis couple week many practitioner implement cycle medication without clear evidence support practice . Investigators expect study able design protocol regard use cyproheptadine feed team patient . FINANCIAL RELATIONSHIPS : There financial relationship interest disclose . ADVERTISEMENTS / FLIERS ( use / distribute ) : None use</detailed_description>
