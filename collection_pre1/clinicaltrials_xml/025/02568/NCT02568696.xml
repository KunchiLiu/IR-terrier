	<detailed_description>Background In clinical kidney transplantation organ retrieval , cold-preservation graft well restoration blood flow transplant cause tissue damage ( ischemia/reperfusion injury ) . Clinically event manifest delay graft function ( DGF ) , usually define need dialysis first week transplantation . DGF increase risk develop chronic rejection subsequently loss transplant . Ischaemia/reperfusion injury biologically characterize local profound inflammatory response , activation coagulation system endothelial dysfunction transplant organ . After reperfusion activate neutrophil cause tissue damage graft production reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) release proteolytic enzyme , lead plug capillary accumulation thrombocytes fibrin . Blood flow diminish increased blood viscosity local vasoconstriction swell endothelial cell . Disorders microcirculation lead `` no-reflow '' phenomenon whereby locally tissue remain ischemic , despite good blood flow organ artery vein . Coagulation activate renal transplant reperfusion , circulate factor VIIa ( FVIIa ) come contact tissue factor ( TF ) , express endothelium due ischaemia . FVII-TF complex activates factor X ( FX ) activate FX ( FXa ) cleave thrombin ( FII ) prothrombin . Thrombin activate thrombocyte , cleaves fibrin fibrinogen activates factor XIII ( FXIII ) , stabilize fibrin clot . Fibrin demonstrate accumulate kidney graft reperfusion . Fibrin accumulation aggravate inhibition fibrinolysis due reperfusion . Furthermore , investigator conduct current research project , previously gain indirect evidence small cohort study , accumulation fibrin occur even reperfusion , donor care organ retrieval . Most importantly , specifically pre-reperfusion fibrin deposition relate DGF . Patients sample size There several limitation investigator previous study concern intra-graft coagulation event DGF . It conduct part large trial renal transplantation include 30 patient two study arm different immunosuppressant regimen ( peri-operative basiliximab conventional triple therapy ) . Therefore , new study , large sample size standardized immunosuppression warrant . Therefore , current prospective observational study surgical technique , anaesthesia hemodynamic management , immunosuppressive medication strictly standardize . Sample size increase 100 . The investigator prospectively screen adult patient receive first kidney transplant cadaveric donor . Only patient schedule receive local standard triple immunosuppressant therapy cyclosporine A , mycophenolate mofetil methylprednisolone include . Blood sample prospective data collection Blood sample assessment intra-graft coagulation event ( generation thrombin fibrin , activation inhibition fibrinolysis ) draw peri-operatively . Predefined clinical demographical data collect preoperatively prospectively 3 month kidney transplantation ass influence coagulation event delay graft function accord Halloran criterion ( 8 ) ( primary outcome ) acute cell mediate graft rejection ( primary outcome ) .</detailed_description>
