	<brief_summary>This project expand research conduct investigator ' group , investigator demonstrate increased LV trabeculation , satisfy currently exist criterion LV Non-Compaction Cardiomyopathy ( LVNC ) , group expose high cardiac workload . To investigator ' knowledge , first prospective study aim demonstrate direct relationship high level exercise increase LV trabeculation . This study may add weight theory entity currently describe LVNC , morphological epiphenomenon common many distinct myocardial remodeling process associate increased cardiac preload afterload may better define normal adaptive increase LV trabeculation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Left Ventricular Non-Compaction Cardiomyopathy Left Ventricular Non-Compaction Cardiomyopathy ( LVNC ) myocardial disorder define increase left ventricular ( LV ) trabeculation intertrabecular recess communicate LV cavity . The condition associate progressive heart failure , systemic thromboembolism predilection fatal ventricular arrhythmia sudden cardiac death . However , large proportion affect individual may asymptomatic . One cohort study demonstrate 28 % detected case LVNC asymptomatic , majority identify family screen . It must emphasize currently diagnostic tool , neither genetic imaging , categorically identify individual LVNC . This lack 'gold standard ' make description increase leave ventricular trabeculation difficult , create tendency apply diagnostic label LVNC inappropriately . Traditional thought LVNC result arrest normal trabecular regression myocardial compaction occur embryological development . However , concept challenge report case 'acquired ' LVNC , serial echocardiogram demonstrate transition normal endocardial appearance hypertrabeculated LVNC phenotype . Whether delay presentation genetically heterogeneous cardiomyopathy morphological epiphenomenon share many phenotypically distinct cardiomyopathy , remain unknown . This irresolution exemplify international discordance , American Heart Association classify LVNC genetic cardiomyopathy European Society Cardiology World Health Organisation take view LVNC remain 'unclassified cardiomyopathy ' . In absence congenital heart disease , LVNC think extremely rare condition prevalence 0.05 % 0.24 % . Technical advance echocardiography , largely second harmonic imaging , lead improvement LV apex lateral wall visualization , dramatically increased frequency detection last 20 year . Limitations current diagnostic criterion At present , various diagnostic criterion exist entirely base morphological finding echocardiography magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . All criterion limitation generate small patient cohort , substantial inter-observer variability poor correlation . This perhaps surprising measure different parameter different echo plane different phase cardiac cycle . In study Kohli et al , 24 % heart failure patient least one three diagnostic echocardiography criterion LVNC ( Chin 19 % , Jenni 15 % , Stollberger 13 % ) , well 8 % healthy control , black ethnicity . Only 7 % fulfil three criterion , indicate relatively poor concordance criterion . These study highlight concern echocardiographic criterion sensitive lack specificity , particularly black individual , result over-diagnosis LVNC . Whilst MRI advantage echocardiography tissue characterisation , superior contrast-to-noise signal-to-noise ratio great ability visualize cardiac apex , CMR criterion identification LVNC suffer limitation echocardiography . When apply CMR criterion Petersen et al , recent population-based prospective multi-ethnic cohort study identify 25.7 % low-risk 'healthy ' population meeting criterion LVNC . Currently , application imaging-based criterion diagnosis low risk population create considerable burden anxiety , potential loss opportunity/earnings , unnecessary investigation clinical follow-up , associate cost National Health Service . There considerable need area evaluate cardiac image criterion contribute diagnosis LVNC . Indeed , propose integration clinical criterion include malignant arrhythmia , thromboembolic event , neuromuscular disorder family history LVNC diagnostic algorithm , though none currently exist . Influence ethnicity cardiac remodel pilot data Racial difference cardiac remodel previously describe respect cardiac hypertrophy . Athletes develop physiological increase LV wall thickness cavity size adaptive response high cardiac preload afterload . This response exaggerate black athlete . For purpose study , black ethnicity define person African African-Caribbean origin . In study compare highly train male athlete , 18 % black athlete exhibit leave ventricular hypertrophy ( LVH ) , define LV wall thickness &gt; 12mm , compare 4 % white athlete ( p &lt; 0.001 ) 13 . The investigator ' group show athlete also display high prevalence increase LV trabeculation compare control ( 18.3 % vs 7.0 % ; p &lt; 0.0001 ) 8.1 % athlete fulfil conventional echocardiographic criterion LVNC . As LVH , difference LV hypertrabeculation appear exaggerated black athlete compare white athlete ( 28.8 % vs 16.3 % ; p = 0.002 ) . The investigator ' group also investigate presence increase LV trabeculation population sickle cell anaemia patient . Chronic anaemia sickle cell disease associate increase LV preload high cardiac output . The investigator find increase LV trabeculation 28 % sickle cell anaemia patient compare 12 % asymptomatic healthy black control . 8 % sickle cell anaemia patient fulfil Chin Jenni criterion LVNC . These study limitation cross-sectional design therefore relationship temporal causality increase cardiac preload development increase LV trabeculations could establish . This lead investigator ' group conduct longitudinal cohort study utilizing pregnancy model increase cardiac preload observe effect LV trabeculation . During pregnancy , 28-36 week gestation , increase LV trabeculation see 25.4 % , demonstrate normal myocardium baseline . Moreover , 7.8 % woman fulfil Chin Jenni criterion LVNC . In addition , black woman appear demonstrate high prevalence increase LV trabeculation compare white woman ( 46 % vs. 13 % ; p = 0.0003 ) . With proposed study investigator aim first demonstrate LV hypertrabeculation induce athletic training individual structurally normal heart return baseline de-training . Although population sample healthy cohort , implication investigator ' finding would resonate throughout cardiac image community fundamentally change perspective clinical detection increase leave ventricular trabeculation . The investigator aim go compare echocardiographic CMR measurement leave ventricular trabeculation investigate whether positive correlation exist improvement cardiopulmonary performance extent de novo LV hypertrabeculation . The project also enable assessment impact gender development LV trabeculation . Should investigator ' hypothesis prove correct , would potentially avoid inappropriate diagnostic labelling , unnecessary anxiety , investigation , treatment , follow family screening . This study may strongly emphasize need robust diagnostic criterion diagnosis LVNC .</detailed_description>
