	<brief_title>Lenalidomide Blinatumomab Treating Patients With Relapsed Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) lenalidomide give combination blinatumomab propose regimen . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To observe record anti-tumor activity anti-tumor response ( complete response [ CR ] partial response [ PR ] per International workshop lymphoma response criterion ) . II . To investigate immune response blinatumomab alone combination lenalidomide . III . To document infection rate 96-hour bag change schedule blinatumomab . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . INDUCTION : Patients receive blinatumomab intravenously ( IV ) continuously day 1-56 lenalidomide orally ( PO ) day 29-49 absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . CONSOLIDATION : Patients achieve response receive blinatumomab IV continuously day 1-7 lenalidomide PO day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . MAINTENANCE : Patients receive response completion Consolidation receive lenalidomide PO day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 28 day 2 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 2 year .</detailed_description>
