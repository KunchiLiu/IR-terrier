	<detailed_description>rationale : The introduction drug-eluting stent ( DES ) treatment coronary artery disease lead significant reduction morbidity . However , first generation device positive impact mortality PCI ( compare bare metal stent ) , greatly attribute somewhat increased incidence late late stent thrombosis . Concerns role durable polymer potential trigger inflammation finally adverse event also lead development DES bioresorbable coating , leave degradation coating bare metal stent vessel wall induce inflammatory response . While bioresorbable polymer DES increasingly use clinical practice , data head-to-head comparison bioresorbable polymer DES contemporary highly flexible new generation permanent polymer coat DES . Aim : The aim study compare outcome bioresorbable polymer coat stent ( ORSIRO ) new generation permanent polymer coat stent ( RESOLUTE ONYX ) all-comers patient population non-inferiority setting . Study design : The study prospective , randomize , single-blinded , multicentre trial 1:1 randomization drug-eluting stent type , stratify gender presence diabetes mellitus . Study population : Patients require percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) treatment coronary stenosis indication DES use , accord current guideline and/or operator clinical judgement . All clinical syndrome include . A total 2,470 patient include . Intervention : One group receive ORSIRO stent , group receive RESOLUTE ONYX stent . All intervention procedural characteristic similar . Primary study outcome : Incidence target vessel failure ( TVF ) 1 year follow-up ( accord ARC definition ) . Components primary endpoint hierarchical order : - Cardiac death : death consider cardiac , unless unequivocal non-cardiac cause establish . - Target vessel relate myocardial infarction ( MI ) Q-wave non-Q-wave , related target vessel relate another vessel . - Clinically driven repeat target vessel revascularization mean PCI coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) .</detailed_description>
