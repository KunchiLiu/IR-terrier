	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 give together docetaxel cisplatin treat patient stage III-IVB squamous cell carcinoma head neck may may able remove surgery ( borderline resectable ) . WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 may block growth tumor cell block enzyme need tumor growth may also help docetaxel cisplatin work well make tumor cell sensitive drug . Drugs use chemotherapy , docetaxel cisplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 docetaxel cisplatin surgery may kill tumor cell shrink tumor , allow patient undergo surgery remove .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety profile determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) dose AZD1775 ( WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 ) combination weekly cisplatin docetaxel neoadjuvant approach locally advanced borderline resectable and/or surgically unresectable high nodal burden ( e.g. , &gt; = N2b disease ) judge appropriate non-surgical definitive therapy . II . To determine pharmacokinetics ( PK ) combination single dose AZD1775 fixed weekly dosing docetaxel cisplatin give three four week cycle . III . To evaluate pharmacodynamic ( PD ) biomarkers AZD1775 drug effect head neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) cancer , particular p53 mutate HNSCC patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES ; I . To evaluate preliminary activity efficacy combination term objective response rate patient borderline resectable unresectable HNSCC particular , p53 mutate HNSCC patient . II . The rate resectability borderline unresectable patient note post neoadjuvant therapy . III . The rate unresectable patient underwent definitive therapy via chemoradiation . IV . Progression-free survival note part preliminary efficacy determination study . VI . During part study , patient monitor carefully development adverse experience monitor clinical and/or radiographic evidence disease progression accord usual standard clinical practice . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To gain mechanistic understanding link p53 mutation status disruption immunoglobulin heavy constant gamma 2 ( G2M ) regulation deregulation . II . To confirm kinase inhibition tumor primary culture well patient tumor-derived xenografted ( PDX ) mouse extract , downstream signal consequence ( WEE1 G2 checkpoint kinase [ WEE1 ] ; WEE1 's target , cyclin-dependent kinase 1 [ CDC2 ] ) , mechanism p53 synthetic lethality sensitize cancer cell genotoxic therapy . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 . Patients receive WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 2-4 , 9-11 , 16-18 , day -7 prior course 1 , day 1 PD assessment . Patients also receive cisplatin intravenously ( IV ) day 1 ( two day last dose WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 lead-in complete ) , 8 ( 7 day first chemotherapy dose ) , 15 , docetaxel IV day 1 , 8 , 15 . Patients experience progressive disease undergo surgical resection . Patients deem surgically resectable proceed chemoradiation clinically indicate . Patients experience stable disease partial response may receive 2 additional course treatment every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year every 6 month 4 year .</detailed_description>
