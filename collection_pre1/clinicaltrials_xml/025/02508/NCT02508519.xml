	<detailed_description>Main purpose study estimate efficiency zonal acupuncture method compare control group balance acupuncture method . This study include random completion 3 group participant : zonal acupuncture , control group , balance acupuncture approximately 20 participant . The zonal acupuncture group receive treatment accord zonal method pain level estimate investigator accord visual analog pain scale ( VAS ) 10 minute 15 minute begin treatment change pain level record . If possible pain level measure approximately 24 hour treatment change pain level record . The control group provide estimation pain level accord visual analog pain scale ( VAS ) receive acupuncture treatment . Then possible pain level measure approximately 24 hour first measurement change pain level record control group . The balance acupuncture group receive treatment accord balance method , pain level estimate accord visual analog pain scale ( VAS ) 10 minute 15 minute begin treatment change pain level record . If possible pain level measure approximately 24 hour treatment change pain level record . These measurement primary outcome experiment . Provided statistically consistent treat extract method efficiency estimation . The participant tree group may receive drug analgesia record moment time procedure , however investigator want investigate effect acupuncture analgesia time analgesia effect present , investigator exclude possible interference .</detailed_description>
