	<detailed_description>What study ? The Miami Heart Study long term observational research study design identify new novel relationship risk factor , genetics , lifestyle behavior cardiovascular disease great Miami area .

The investigator expect approximately 4,000 member South Florida community and/or employee Baptist Health participate study next 5 year . The research study aim well understand heart disease cause . Heart disease often start many year person heart attack develop symptoms heart disease . This call subclinical disease - refers heart disease body process cause heart disease , stage symptom experience . Although doctor researcher good understanding heart disease area , subclinical disease well understood . Better understanding subclinical disease allow doctor healthcare staff intervene prevent process develop cause symptomatic ( symptom ) heart disease . Progression refers process subclinical ( without symptom ) heart disease develop clinical ( symptom ) disease . Therefore , purpose research study : - To examine presence severity subclinical disease South Florida community . - To examine unique factor contribute development subclinical disease appearance clinical symptom . In future , investigator hope information allow u good predict prevent development heart disease diverse population . Participants ask come Miami Heart Study clinic examination may take 4 6 hour complete .
