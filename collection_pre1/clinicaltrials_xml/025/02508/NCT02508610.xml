	<brief_summary>This protocol generate response exploratory R21 National Institutes Health/National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases ( NIH/NIAID ) US-Russia collaborative research HIV/tuberculosis ( TB ) . Given exploratory focus protocol short time frame funding ( 2 year ) study TB Irkutsk , Eastern Siberia . Irkutsk one hardest-hit area Russian Federation drug-resistant TB poor TB outcome . Specifically , investigator examine factor anti-TB drug pharmacokinetics , TB drug-resistance mutation virulent/transmissible M. tuberculosis sublineages . This foundational work inform future diagnostic strategy therapeutic regimen .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The multidrug-resistant tuberculosis ( MDR-TB ) epidemic Irkutsk oblast Eastern Siberia arguably severe world . The investigator find Irkutsk TB Dispensary , referral hospital oblast ( state ) , patient HIV primary MDR-TB ( prior history TB treatment ) suffer poor outcome inpatient phase treatment . It also find genotypic drug-resistance mutation partially explain extent phenotypic resistance widespread Irkutsk . Suboptimal serum anti-TB drug concentration amplify phenotypic resistance work setting demonstrate importance optimize pharmacokinetics improve TB outcome . Such foundational work anti-TB/antiretroviral drug concentration lack drug use treatment MDR-TB , absent HIV-infected population . Furthermore , investigator find HIV infection Irkutsk associate Beijing TB genotype similar high burden setting , overall mortality frequent M. tuberculosis sublineage Beijing MIT17 . Thus take together investigator hypothesize high early TB mortality Irkutsk due combination complex MDR extensively drug resistant ( XDR ) -TB incompletely diagnose incompletely treat , poor anti-TB/antiretroviral pharmacokinetics lead low efficacy increase circulation hyper-transmissible virulent M. tuberculosis sublineages . For subject suspect TB , sputum sample leftover sputum/blood specimen screen GeneXpert positive , cultured TB culture specimen subject drug-susceptibility test conventional qualitative resistance minimum inhibitory concentration ( MIC ) , sequence drug-resistance mutation spoligotyping sublineage identification . Primary analysis include standard sensitivity/specificity drug-mutation compare conventional qualitative resistance median/range MIC value among isolates with/without mutation improve discrimination . Sublineage analysis mycobacterial intersperse repetitive unit/variable-number tandem repeat ( MIRU24-VNTR ) correlate drug-resistance conventional susceptibility , MIC sequence result drug-resistance mutation . The transmission capacity sublineages evaluate level cluster via 24-loci MIRU typing . For subject ultimately initiate TB treatment , pharmacokinetic parameter test MIC TB drug patient 's regimen include peak ( Cmax ) area concentration-time curve ( AUC ) . Parameters compare expected range drug express population value individual level ( proportion patient expect range drug ) . The clinical outcome TB treatment failure compare proportion subject baseline ( 2 week ) Cmax/MIC minimal target ( low µg/ml concentration/ high MIC isolate still consider susceptible ) 2 key drug regimen . It anticipate TB treatment failure frequent subject treat drug-susceptible TB Cmax/MIC value low target rifampin isoniazid , subject treat MDR-TB value minimal target ofloxacin kanamycin . A binary logistic regression model use determine possible risk factor TB treatment failure addition pharmacokinetic parameter . The investigator aim drug-resistance sublineage analysis perform M. tuberculosis isolate 250 subject , 200 undergo pharmacokinetic study . Between Irkutsk Dispensary Irkutsk AIDS Center , estimate 700 subject would eligible . The majority enrol Irkutsk Dispensary M. tuberculosis positive specimen ( anticipate ~175 total enrol ) complete pharmacokinetic analysis . It expect few subject ( anticipated ~25 ) enrol referral Irkutsk AIDS Center commence TB treatment Irkutsk Dispensary complete pharmacokinetic analysis . Sample size restrict exploratory/observational focus R21 funding source , thus estimate upon subject recruited/enrolled 12 month period . All microbiologic testing perform onsite TB laboratory Irkutsk Dispensary . DNA sample analyze Institute Epidemiology Microbiology/Russian Academy Medical Sciences Irkutsk . The subset subject positive M. tuberculosis initiate TB treatment Irkutsk Dispensary pharmacokinetic sampling ( research ) plasma anti-TB drug concentration 2 week 12 week initiation anti-TB treatment ( see outline ) . If applicable , antiretroviral concentration ( efavirenz nevirapine ) also perform . In addition , subject structure interview review hospital/clinic chart follow data : demographic ( age , sex , country/region origin ) , prior TB history include prior TB treatment regimen , site TB disease ( pulmonary , central nervous system ( CNS ) , lymph node , bone/joint , genitourinary ) , medical comorbidities HIV ( diabetes , chronic kidney disease , liver disease , smoking , alcohol injection drug use ) , current chest radiograph abnormality , baseline laboratory value ( CBC , chemistry , liver function test , erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( ESR ) applicable recent CD4+ T cell count HIV-1 RNA level ) . For subset initiate anti-TB treatment , follow-up chart review perform time subject discharge death , determine TB treatment outcome . Further detail pharmacokinetic sampling : All subject initiate anti-TB treatment venous blood sample draw pharmacokinetic study 2 week 12 week initiation . The 2 week time point allows steady state accumulation anti-TB drug level , 12 week mark compare change response treat disease , improve malabsorption weight gain and/or initiation antiretroviral ( anti-HIV ) therapy . All medication directly administer observed nursing staff fast state per hospital routine . All anti-TB medication give morning dose . For antiretrovirals ( may assay subset patient 12 week mark ) , nevirapine dose q12 hour efavirenz even dose , whereby efavirenz C2hr level ( relative timing anti-TB med ) serve trough level C12hr peak . This sample strategy minimizes patient blood draw , similar prior pharmacokinetic study . A maximum 10 ml obtain heparinized tube draw 6 drug require assayed HPLC . Blood immediately centrifuge onsite Dispensary plasma store seal screw-cap tube -80°C subject 's study identification number week/time blood draw . Batched plasma specimen ship University Virginia high performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) test per establish protocol . Further detail sputum specimen collection : A trained study nurse use airborne precaution collect expectorate sputum enrol subject . The sputum collect sealable container label subject 's study ID number securely transported day Irkutsk Dispensary TB Laboratory GeneXpert MTB/RIF test available . As GeneXpert validate , WHO-approved test M. tuberculosis screening , result communicate directly treat physician train study nurse , per standard care . The remainder investigation , include MIC testing , sequence drug-resistance mutation spoligotyping sublineage identification , experimental .</detailed_description>
