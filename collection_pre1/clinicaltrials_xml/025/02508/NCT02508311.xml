	<brief_summary>Spinal cord injury ( SCI ) , especially involve cervical upper thoracic segment , significantly compromise respiratory muscle function . Respiratory complication ensue , include lung collapse pneumonia , primary cause mortality association traumatic SCI acute chronic phase post-injury . Lesions level cervical high thoracic spinal cord result respiratory muscle weakness , associate ineffective cough , mucus retention , mucus plugging . Despite fact pulmonary complication major cause morbidity mortality population , paucity effective intervention SCI population know improve respiratory muscle strength pharmacologic intervention receive little attention . The current objective study determine effectiveness 16 week sustain release oral Albuterol ; ( 1 ) improve respiratory muscular strength , ( 2 ) improve cough effectiveness .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Albuterol Improve Respiratory Strength SCI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although past 40 year witness substantial improvement acute chronic management person SCI , mortality remain high first year post-injury , pulmonary complication include pneumonia , lung collapse ( atelectasis ) , respiratory failure , thromboembolism predominant cause . The propensity pulmonary complication among subject SCI stem paralysis respiratory muscle . Injury cervical upper thoracic cord significantly compromise function diaphragm , intercostal muscle , accessory respiratory muscle , abdominal muscle . Respiratory muscle dysfunction manifest diminution lung volume , reduction maximal static inspiratory expiratory mouth pressure ( MIP MEP , respectively ) , reduction peak cough pressure flow . Cough effectiveness contingent upon inspiratory expiratory muscle strength ; increase pressure-generating capacity inspiratory expiratory muscle person tetraplegia high paraplegia may , therefore , translate improve cough effectiveness reduction propensity atelectasis , possibly , pneumonia . Respiratory muscle training , often utilizing simple hand-held portable resistive threshold training device , appear marginal effect vital capacity maximal static mouth inspiratory expiratory pressure ( MIP MEP , respectively ) , although data inconclusive . Pharmacologic intervention improve respiratory muscle strength receive little attention SCI population . Studies involve oral beta-2 adrenergic agonist , show elicit anabolic effect skeletal muscle young men increase muscle strength among patient facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy , also demonstrate salutary effect person SCI . There many foreseeable advantage pharmacologic approach improve respiratory muscle strength person SCI . For instance , RMT physically demand time consuming , compliance issue , sustainable improvement realize . The intent present proposal enroll target cohort 24 comparatively weak subject tetraplegia high paraplegia randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel group trial ass effect oral beta-2 agonist upon respiratory muscle strength cough effectiveness .</detailed_description>
