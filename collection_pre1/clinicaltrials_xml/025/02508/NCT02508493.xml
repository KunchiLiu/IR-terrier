	<brief_summary>Cognitive dysfunction highly persistent , pervasive progressive abnormality young adult ( i.e. , 18-65 year ) MDD . It also show among adult MDD gainfully employ , measure cognition great determinant overall workplace performance total depression symptom severity . Several line evidence indicate cognitive deficit persist episode depression critical determinant functional recovery workplace . The functional implication associate cognitive impairment provide impetus systematic evaluation , measurement assessment domains cognition expect impaired patient population . To date , measurement tool sufficiently validate and/or determine sensitive cognitive deficit young adult MDD . Major limitation available comprehensive psychometric tool include relative lack availability , cost , lack access healthcare provider , else , lengthy time administer . Moreover , need psychometrist interpret result add complexity costliness endeavor . It imperative tool recommend clinical utility align busy nature high-volume clinical practice . The ideal gold standard tool assess presence cognitive dysfunction MDD clinical environment include , limited , feature good conceptual coverage cognitive domain affect MDD , good sensitivity reliability , relatively uninfluenced culture effect practice effect . The tool would also need brief , easy administer interpret , complement busy clinical practice . This study design validate brief user-friendly tool capable detect deficit cognitive performance among adult MDD . Data gather aim determine whether propose tool identifies cognitive deficit adult MDD differentiate clinical MDD population healthy control . It anticipate THINC-it tool free charge downloadable THINC-it website use primary care specialty set . The THINC-it tool accessible via computers/tablets , take 20 minute self-administer clinical setting , performance result immediately available .</brief_summary>
