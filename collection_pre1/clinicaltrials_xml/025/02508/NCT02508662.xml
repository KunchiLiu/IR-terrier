	<brief_summary>Objectives : Primary Objectives : To evaluate anti-cancer activity commercially available , target anti-cancer therapy use off-label treatment patient advance solid cancer know genomic aberration . Secondary Objectives : To determine outcomes patient treat matched target anti-cancer therapy base know genomic aberration . To obtain treatment related adverse event patient advance solid tumor treat -label target therapy . To determine co-genomic aberration may contribute treatment response resistance mechanism . To determine feasibility detect genomic alteration plasma , genomic evolution circulate biomarkers .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Treatment Assignment : If find eligible take part study , study doctor review test result medical record previously perform part routine care . The result test may helpful manage treatment may also help doctor find effective off-label use FDA approve therapy type cancer . After review screen test molecular test result medical record , study staff study doctor work together find off-label use FDA approve therapy best . You may receive single therapy combination therapy . You study doctor discus . The study doctor study staff tell drug ( ) taking , dose study drug ( ) , often take . You sign separate consent form explain detail study drug ( ) administer potential benefit side effect take study drug ( ) . Study Visits : While receive treatment follow-up , routine , standard care clinic visit routine test doctor may check status disease learn therapy choose treat disease effect . Information routine visit collect stored study staff . The timing visit depend type therapy receive . During every cycle therapy ( every 3-4 week ) : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - If doctor think need , urine collect routine test . - If doctor think need , EKG check health heart . After even numbered cycle ( 2 , 4 , 6 , ) , often doctor think need , image scan ( ) do Screening check status disease . This investigational study . Up 100 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
