	<brief_summary>Previous study neglect two important aspect China National Space Administration . First , biomechanical model sensitive characteristic subject , data collect subject biomechanical characteristic different `` typical '' Chinese astronaut . Second , pure video analysis technique kinematic data lack necessary acceleration information important understanding force exert movement control human motion . While study use force moment sensor aid robot torque control human joint work estimation , investigator unaware study perform microgravity environment combine kinetic force moment information acceleration measurement enable reliable motion track without need acceleration estimation . This MICR0-G sensor accompany kinematic video system develop order provide detail analysis astronaut movement control strategy ( joint force torque , kinetic acceleration measurement ) . Knowledge joint torque permit u calculate joint musculoskeletal dynamic require execute microgravity motion , well provide insight altered movement strategy reduce gravity compare 1-G locomotion .</brief_summary>
