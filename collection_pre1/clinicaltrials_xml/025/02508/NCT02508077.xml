	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well fluorouracil , leucovorin calcium , irinotecan hydrochloride ( FOLFIRI ) together panitumumab work treat patient colorectal cancer express RAS B-Raf proto-oncogene , serine/threonine kinase ( BRAF ) wild-type gene , spread original site growth another part body ( metastatic ) , resist effect treatment prior cetuximab ( panitumumab ) plus irinotecan hydrochloride-based therapy , fail least one subsequent non-anti-epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) contain treatment regimen . Drugs use chemotherapy , fluorouracil , leucovorin calcium , irinotecan hydrochloride , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) may kill tumor cell . Monoclonal antibody , panitumumab , may block tumor growth different way target certain cell . Giving FOLFIRI together panitumumab may effective treatment colorectal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>FOLFIRI Panitumumab Treating Patients With RAS BRAF Wild-Type Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Estimate response rate ( RR ) progression-free survival ( PFS ) FOLFIRI + panitumumab patient acquire resistance panitumumab ( cetuximab ) + irinotecan ( irinotecan hydrochloride ) -based therapy document clinical response prolong PFS follow progression subsequent non-anti-EGFR contain regimen extend RAS wild-type BRAF wild-type patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Estimate overall survival ( OS ) re-challenge population . II . Describe safety re-challenge population . III . Investigate impact PFS , RR prior anti-EGFR + irinotecan-based exposure response PFS current study . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Collect serial plasma sample investigate incidence RAS BRAF mutation circulate free deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) baseline , every 2 month , time progression ( follow progression feasible ) . II . Collect serial plasma sample future biomarker exploration , include potential investigation micro-ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) . OUTLINE : Patients receive panitumumab intravenously ( IV ) 30-90 minute , irinotecan hydrochloride IV 90 minute , leucovorin calcium orally ( PO ) , fluorouracil IV 46 hour day 1 . Courses repeat every 2 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day every 3 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
