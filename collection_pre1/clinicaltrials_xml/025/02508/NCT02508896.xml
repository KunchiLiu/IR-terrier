	<brief_summary>Study AFF012 single blind , single-center , randomize , placebo-controlled , parallel group , phase I clinical trial repeat administration subcutaneous injection single dose one two different proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 target AFFITOPE® vaccine Placebo . This study ass Safety , Immunogenicity low density lipoprotein cholesterol-lowering activity two vaccine . 72 healthy subject divide three test group ( 2 treatment group , 1 placebo group ) , consist 24 subject . The subject randomize receive either two AFFITOPEs® ( AT04A AT06A , adsorb 1 mg aluminium oxyhydroxide ) placebo ( 1 mg aluminium oxyhydroxide ) . The study consist 3 part , part A , encompass Visit 1 Visit 8 , cover 3 prim immunization dose 15μg day 0 , 28 56 immediate observation period extend day 140 ; prolong observation period : part B , encompass Visit 9 Visit 10 day 273 365 ; part C consist 7 visit ( V11 V17 ) . Study participant receive 3 priming vaccination complete part B receive part C one boost immunization dose 75μg , apply one year 3rd immunization ( day 420 ) . Probands proceed directly part A part B part C. Continuation part B C consider base part A result , primarily immunological result . The following scenario apply ( provide safety issue ) . None two treatment group exhibit vaccine-specific antibody response placebo group Visit 8 - lead termination trial . One two group fails exhibit vaccine-specific antibody response placebo group Visit 8 - lead discontinuation ; treatment group placebo group continue .</brief_summary>
