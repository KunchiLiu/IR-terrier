	<brief_summary>This randomize , prospective , open label study determine cost-effectiveness genotype-guided antiplatelet therapy . Patients undergo percutaneous intervention ( PCI ) stent implantation , randomize either genotype guide dose antiplatelet therapy usual care . The study utilize novel genotyping device , SpartanRx , determine CYP2C19 genotypes buccal swab sample 1 hour turnaround time .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Clopidogrel thienopyridine antiplatelet agent , inhibit purinergic P2RY12 receptor platelet prevent aggregation . It commonly use patient acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) undergo percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) . CYP2C19 one principal enzymes involve bioactivation clopidogrel pro-drug active metabolite . The common loss function ( LOF ) allele *2 ( c.681G &gt; A ; rs4244285 ) , frequencies ~15 % Caucasians Africans 29-35 % Asians . A large meta-analysis demonstrate CYP2C19*2 carrier treat clopidogrel high risk major adverse cardiac event compare noncarriers.Therefore , clopidogrel less effective patient CYP2C19 poor metabolizers alternative therapy recommend . A newer-generation thienopyridine , prasugrel , find associate reduction major adverse cardiac event ( death , myocardial infarction , stroke ) compare clopidogrel , increase risk fatal major bleed event . Now clopidogrel available generic form , pharmacogenetic ( PGx ) screening could allow individualized anti-platelet therapy patient functional CYP2C19 allele could prescribe clopidogrel , expensive agent would reserve patient poor metabolizer status . A cost-effectiveness analysis CYP2C19 screen selection antiplatelet therapy find genotype-guided therapy would lead cost-effective care rather uniform usage either clopidogrel prasugrel . A recent economic evaluation determine genotyping prescribe ticagrelor LOF allele carrier effective strategy compare routine clopidogrel prasugrel use well genotyping prescribe prasugrel LOF carrier . However , result base decision model hypothetical cohort patient ACS underwent PCI several assumption make regard outcome , cost quality life . True cost associate genotype guide antiplatelet therapy unknown . Future prospective study evaluate cost effectiveness genotype guide approach need . We propose pilot study provide information necessary planning prospective study directly estimate event avert , cost , quality-adjust life year ( QALYs ) cost per QALY ratio . Information obtain pilot include estimate cost variance , preference score ( calculate QALYs ) variance , correlation cost effect ( require sample size estimation cost-effectiveness ratio ) , event rate , implementation metric ( estimate likely penetration test trial ) . The result study provide accurate estimate mean variance cost QALYs require plan future trial . OBJECTIVES - To conduct prospective pilot study determine mean variance cost , QALYs correlation cost effect . - To identify factor link successful implementation clinical pharmacogenetic ( PGx ) test large academic medical center . - To determine rate clinical outcome . APPROACH In genotype guide arm , buccal swab obtain subject immediately follow PCI/stent , determine CYP2C19 genotype SpartanRx system . Subject slow metabolizer status [ 1 2 loss-of-function ( LOF ) mutation ( *2 *3 ) CYP2C19 ] recommend initiate therapy prasugrel ticagrelor place clopidogrel . Subjects normal metabolizer status ( homozygous *1 allele CYP2C19 ) recommend initiate therapy clopidogrel . Antiplatelet choice ultimately decide physician judgment incorporate clinical factor . In control arm , choice antiplatelet therapy decide treat physician per usual care . DNA collect via saliva sample ass CYP2C19 genotype conclusion study . Subjects group complete baseline health relate quality life questionnaire ( HrQoL ) additional clinical data pertain cardiac history collect medical record . Subjects contact every three month medical service utilization , clinical information , HrQoL assessments total one year .</detailed_description>
