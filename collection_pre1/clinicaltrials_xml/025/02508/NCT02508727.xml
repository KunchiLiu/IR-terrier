	<brief_summary>Cardiac exploration almost systematically require acquisition / calculate function index . The ejection fraction ( LVEF ) probably base index widely use cardiac exploration method . This relatively universal overall index many quality . LVEF widely use clinical practice exploration monitor heart disease . Current progress management various cardiomyopathy pass detection early attack . This test often take place upstream change LVEF remain long normal normalize . Sensitive indicator capable detect early abnormality regional function essential addition conventional echocardiography . Various study show contribution new marker early detection abnormality cardiac function . The widely use indicator study high sensitivity analyze movement heart tissue Doppler . Tissue Doppler however limitations particular dependence incident angle , make impossible correct analysis non-aligned axis ultrasonic beam component . A new way explore regional function heart , speckle tracking , analyze heart deformation along principal axes heart . The advantage technique show various pathological situation . Currently , technique mostly use longitudinal transverse view 2D impose multiple plane cut . 3D potential technique currently know , acquisition 3D technology recent ( 2004 ) dedicate software confidential dissemination unvalidated . The validated technique , 3D reference analysis myocardial deformation tag MRI . In 90 , study demonstrate feasibility technique , ability access myocardial deformation space define normal value . The cost procedure , duration , limited accessibility post-processing time consume limited scope clinical benefit modality . Echocardiography major advantage MRI , particularly high availability , low cost flexibility use . The ability access MRI 3D deformation heart new opportunity essential validate . The main purpose study compare strain value obtain 3D ultrasound obtain MRI tag control group group subject anterior infarction sequela .</brief_summary>
