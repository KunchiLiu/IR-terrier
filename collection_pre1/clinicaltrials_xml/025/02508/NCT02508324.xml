	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine overall safety adoptive immunotherapy give chemotherapy AML/MDS . Adoptive immunotherapy mean use infusion cell donor help fight cancer . The donor cell either umbilical cord blood newborn baby cell collect relative ( haplo-identical cell ) . The 2 cohort discuss - adoptive immunotherapy either UCB haplo-identical stem cell - analyze separately . Preliminary data center suggest adoptive immunotherapy cell relative effective approach may improve remission rate survival AML MDS , exert anti-cancer effect ( call graft v leukemia effect ) possibly hasten recovery cell count chemotherapy . The Investigators interested confirm data , also test umbilical cord blood cell purpose . Preliminary data indicate umbilical cord blood cell may powerful graft v leukemia effect cause few side-effects .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>IPA Targeted Adoptive Immunotherapy v Adult Haplo-identical Cell Infusion During Induction High Risk Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase 2 trial evaluate safety adoptive immunotherapy Non-Inherited Maternal Antigen ( NIMA ) compatible , Inherited Paternal Antigen ( IPA ) target CBU haplo-identical stem cell conventional induction therapy high risk Acute Myeloid Leukemia ( AML ) Myelodysplastic Syndrome ( MDS ) . The study 2 cohort - patient cohort 1 receive CBU cell adoptive immunotherapy . Patients cohort 2 receive haplo-identical cell . Both cohort evaluate separately formal statistical comparison cohort perform . There approximately 20 patient cohort , 95 % confidence interval proportion patient experience grade III-IV GVHD complication unexplained prolonged myelosuppression complication cohort construct within +/- 13.1 % observed complication proportion . This calculation assume expect prevalence complication proportion great 10 % . After 10 patient enrol group , incidence above-defined life-threatening complication assess . If one patient 10 enrolled patient ( i.e. , great 10 % ) cohort experience either complication , cohort stop safety . All potential recipient complete HLA type determination HLA antibody . An appropriate umbilical cord blood unit ( CBU ) identify absence appropriate CBU , haplo-identical donor identify . Treatment per treat physician 's choice.. The umbilical cord graft haplo-graft administer 24 - 72 hour completion chemotherapy regimen . The Graft Selection Algorithm follow : 1 . CBU Unit 5/6 Matched - 1 NIMA match patient 2 . CBU Unit 5/6 Matched - Shared IPA target ( ) patient 3 . Haplo-identical relative 4 . CBU Unit 4/6 Matched - 1-2 NIMA match patient 5 . CBU Unit 4/6 Matched - Shared IPA target ( ) patient Within 42 day transplant , recipient 's pre-treatment evaluation include : medical history physical examination , ECOG , CBC , HLA antibody , CMV antibody test . Patients continue therapy specify protocol one following occur : - Achievement protocol endpoint CR CRp induction cellular therapy ; - Failure achieve CR CRp ; , - Extraordinary Medical Circumstances : If , time constraint protocol detrimental patient 's health and/or patient longer wish continue protocol therapy , remove patient protocol treatment . In event . After removal protocol therapy , patient continue follow survival disease status . Samples correlative study continue collect every two month one year cell infusion .</detailed_description>
