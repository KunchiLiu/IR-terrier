	<brief_summary>Ineffective management blood glucose ( BG ) level preconception pregnancy associate severe maternal fetal complication woman type 1 diabetes ( T1DM ) . Preconception care emphasize stringent glycemic control preconception period continue early pregnancy dramatically reduce risk . However , use preconception care US disappointingly low due variety organizational , provider , patient center factor . Furthermore , effort achieve tight glycemic control increase risk severe hypoglycemia ( SH ) T1DM woman , potentially lead serious health consequence . In project , investigator test education base Internet intervention ( Bump2be Blood glucose awareness training ( BGAT ) user might become pregnant ) use T1DM woman either actively try become pregnant ( TP ) plan become pregnant 12 month follow enrollment study ( PP ) . The main objective examine Bump2be 's feasibility preliminary efficacy intervention woman well regulate BG level meet diabetes-related clinical target pregnancy . More specifically , Bump2be test randomized clinical trial 58 T1DM woman either TP PP recruit . As part pre-post study design , participant randomly assign either Bump2be intervention ( n=29 ) routine care group ( n=29 ) . Data collect include frequency extreme BG , consequence extreme BG , average BG level ( HbA1c level ) , estimation BG , detection low high BG , psychological functioning ( include fear hypoglycemia , avoidance hyperglycemia , well-being , internal locus control ) . Interviews 10 trial participant conduct conclusion study participation , enable optimization intervention preparation subsequent R01 submission . This first study investigate use Internet improve detection management extreme BG level Diabetes mellitus type 1 ( T1DM ) woman either TP PP .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Scientific Background : The number woman type 1 diabetes expect rise , particularly early reproductive year . Pre-existing diabetes pregnancy increase risk various maternal ( e.g. , hypoglycemia diabetic ketoacidosis ) fetal complication . Uncontrolled BG level immediately pregnancy associate miscarriage , pre-eclampsia , infant mortality twofold fourfold increase risk major congenital malformation . Maternal hyperglycemia show complicate pregnancy factor associate high rate spontaneous abortion congenital malformation . Preconception care emphasize stringent BG control preconception period ( least three six month prior pregnancy ) continue throughout significantly reduce risk level similar report non-diabetic population . These attempt achieve tight BG control , however , link increase incidence SH early pregnancy . These finding point critical importance provide TIDM woman practical self-management skill actively use good manage BG level , achieve target glycemic control without undue risk hypoglycemia preparation pregnancy . At present , however , publish behavioral intervention specifically tailor improve detection management extreme BG level patient population . Rationale : The overall aim research develop ( Phase 1 ) test ( Phase 2 ) feasibility Bump2be Internet intervention use Diabetes mellitus type 1 ( T1DM ) woman either TP PP help effectively detect reduce occurrence extreme BG level . Phase 1 research submit approve Institutional Review Board ( HSR # 16668 ) 2013 complete . The Bump2be intervention base BGATHome ( Blood Glucose Awareness Training Home ) , automate , tailor , Internet deliver , psycho-educational intervention T1DM patient . BGATHome base theory self-regulation health behavior , train focus patient ' learn use internal cue ( e.g. , physical mood change ) external cue ( e.g. , insulin food action ) improve BG awareness . It proven successful improve patient ' glycemic control well ability detect , anticipate , avoid , treat extreme BG level . Investigators historically exclude T1DM woman either pregnant planning pregnancy BGAT-related study give unique clinical need glycemic target . The investigator propose evaluate feasibility effectiveness Bump2be woman T1DM either TP PP help well regulate BG level meet diabetes-related clinical target pregnancy . This protocol cover Phase 2 project . Relevance : There urgent need effectively support Diabetes mellitus type 1 ( T1DM ) woman either TP PP effort achieve maintain strict glycemic control without experience SH . The investigator propose test Internet-based training program ( Bump2be.org ) assist woman well anticipate , detect , manage , prevent extreme BG occurrences enable meet glycemic goal pregnancy . If find efficacious , Bump2be first Internet-based behavioral intervention train assist woman achieve recommend glycemic target without increase risk SH . The program potential impact target patient major public health level supplement preconception care conveniently accessible program tailor specific need . It hold promise improve BG management also psychosocial functioning ( e.g. , reduce fear hypoglycemia , improve diabetes-related quality life knowledge ) additional burden healthcare system .</detailed_description>
