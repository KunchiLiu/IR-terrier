	<brief_summary>Parabolic flight ground-based condition weightlessness ( 0G ) create long enough safely test change human perception behavior . In addition 0G period , parabolic flight generates equal duration period 1.8G , present another unique opportunity test responses hypergravity back 1G . Cognitive function , together good oculomotor control , eye-hand coordination , spatial orientation perception , critical subsystem use CNS control vehicle complex system high-level integrative function . Evidence space flight research demonstrate function subsystem alter transition gravito-inertial force level . These neuro-vestibular alteration , unfortunately , correspond mission phase physical cognitive performance particularly critical crew safety mission success . To date , limited operational evidence alteration cause functional impact mission-critical vehicle ( complex system ) control capability . However , true operational risk estimable investigator fill knowledge gap investigator accurately assess integrated performance off-nominal operational setting . Accurate perception self-in-space motion self-motion relative object critical piloting , drive , remote manipulator operation . Immediately space flight , crewmembers report degree disorientation/perceptual illusion , often accompany nausea ( symptoms motion sickness ) , frequently manifest lack coordination , particularly locomotion . Despite recent , intensive training , Shuttle landing outside desire performance boundary . Scores indicate neurovestibular dysfunction return astronaut generally correlate poorer fly performance , include low approach land short , faster , harder . An underestimation distance , couple overestimation tilt magnitude misperception type motion , could origin poor performance . This study confirm unload otoliths weightlessness induces alteration egocentric reference space flight . Errors egocentric localization might contribute high level computation mislead world-centered representation , therefore partly responsible illusory sensation motion sickness symptom space flight , postural instability oscillopsia return reduce terrestrial gravitational force level . Beside fundamental implication , result study also practical implication design man-machine interface . Changes judgment distance microgravity reduce gravity affect crew posture reach , display orientation , visual cue , consider hardware operation design .</brief_summary>
