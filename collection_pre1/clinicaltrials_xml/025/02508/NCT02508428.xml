	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether crosslinked Marathon standard Enduron polyethylene liner show difference survivorship due wear-related revision minimum 14-year follow-up every 5 year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Marathon Enduron Polyethylene Long-Term Follow-up</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several institution report low wear rate crosslinked polyethylene base early midterm clinical data . However , since revision associate osteolysis typically occur 10-year follow-up , great benefit reduce wear associate crosslinked polyethylene expect reflect low revision rate wear-related complication long-term follow-up . While crosslinking proven substantially reduce polyethylene wear first decade vivo , characterize long-term clinical performance Marathon polyethylene remain important crosslinking accompanied reduction ultimate tensile strength , fatigue strength , elongation failure ultra high molecular weight polyethylene . As consequence , concern express potential liner fracture , vivo polyethylene oxidation accelerate wear long-term follow-up , effect femoral head roughen time bioreactivity crosslinked polyethylene debris particle . Ultimately , best way address concern context well-controlled , long-term clinical outcome study . This study evaluate outcome minimum 14-years surgery among group patient whose outcome previously report 10-year follow-up . As part effort follow patient throughout life obtain long-term outcome data , continue obtain routine follow-up every 5 year date patient 's primary total hip arthroplasty duration patient 's life revision polyethylene liner ( estimate 25 year ) . Because anticipate reduce incidence wear osteolysis result low incidence revision surgery among patient randomize Marathon liner , implant revision reason relate wear primary outcome measure long-term follow-up .</detailed_description>
