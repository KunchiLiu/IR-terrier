	<brief_summary>There equivalent experiment setup create comparable change gravitation parabolic flight . To determine initial orthostatic response cardiovascular system gravitational condition mar moon essential step well understand 1 ) fundamental function human cardiovascular system ( basic research ) 2 ) specific impact partial-g human heart , lung vessel spaceflight-context 3 ) approach countermeasure development orthostatic intolerance moon mar ( apply research ) . Non-invasive measurement method use achieve cardiovascular key value study : stroke volume ( SV ) cardiac output determination pulse contour analysis , impedance cardiography inert gas rebreathing , beat-to-beat finger blood pressure measurement , heart rate heart rate variability determination ECG . All method prove accuracy parabolic flight . Nevertheless pulse contour analysis impedance cardiography know provide relative SV CO value . Thus inert gas rebreathing give u possibility calibrate stroke volume cardiac output absolute value . Success procedure show former parabolic flight .</brief_summary>
