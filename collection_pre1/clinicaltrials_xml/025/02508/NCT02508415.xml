Periodontal disease chronic inflammatory disease result gingival inflammation , irreversible attachment loss , alveolar bone destruction eventually tooth loss . Worldwide , prevalence periodontitis adult population 10-15 % . Periodontal disease , inflammation destruction periodontium produce clinical sign symptom , may considerable impact quality life ( QoL ) . A positive association obesity periodontal disease repeatedly demonstrate worldwide . Obese individual elevate level circulate TNF- α IL-6 compare normal weight individual . These cytokine decrease weight loss . Adipokines produce adipose tissue could one mechanisms mediate association obesity periodontal disease . This suggest obesity may potential modify host 's immunity inflammatory system . This project extend exist information association obesity periodontal disease include QoL aspect Malaysia population . It also improve knowledge cellular molecular mechanism underpin obesity-periodontal disease relationship .

	<detailed_description>Obesity epidemic increase prevalence country Asia Pacific region . It characterize abnormal excessive lipid deposition result chronic disproportion energy intake energy outflow . The first Malaysian national estimate 1996 obesity 5.8 % . A systematic review report marked increase obesity 1996 , 2003 , 2004 2006 5.5 % , 12.2 % , 12.3 % 14.0 % . Obesity high among adults 40-59 year old , great risk woman compare men high among Indians follow Malays , Chinese Aboriginals . Periodontitis obesity chronic health problem , association two condition exists . A positive association repeatedly demonstrate obesity periodontal disease multiple study around world . Periodontal disease chronic oral infection , destruction tooth support structure , periodontal ligament alveolar bone occur , lead ultimately tooth loss . Worldwide , prevalence periodontitis adult population 10-15 % . In Malaysia , National Oral Health study report 90.2 % adult present form periodontal condition . About 5.5 % subject deep pocket 6 mm . Periodontal disease , inflammation destruction periodontium produce wide range clinical sign symptom , may considerable impact quality life ( QoL ) . A study conduct use community sample find significant association periodontal disease quality life ( QoL ) . They also find self-reported symptom periodontal disease swell gum , sore gum recede gums apparent impact quality life person . With mechanism obesity , expect obese patient may experience severe periodontal disease hence may experience impact quality life . However , evidence still lack . Cytokines play role pathogenesis periodontitis . They play active role wound repair transient inflammation . They also activate defence mechanism may give rise considerable tissue damage severe inflammation . Adipose tissue cell namely adipocytes , preadipocytes macrophage secrete protein signal collectively know adipokines adipocytokines . Adipokines involve inflammation acute-phase response . Production adipokines increase obesity , raise circulating level several acute-phase protein inflammatory cytokine . This lead concept obese state chronic low-grade systemic inflammation causally link insulin resistance metabolic syndrome . Salivary component comprise several inflammatory immune mediator identify involved periodontal destruction . Among adipokines , resistin adipocyte-derived cytokine raise obese mouse . In human , suggest resistin largely express neutrophil , macrophage , monocyte adipocytes . Resistin identify proinflammatory adipokine potentially link obesity diabetes . It also believe human resistin stimulate production secretion proinflammatory molecule like tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) -α interleukin ( IL ) -12 . Studies show high level resistin subject chronic periodontitis may affect systemic health . In study Devanoorkar et al. , state decrease resistin level statistically significant follow non-surgical periodontal therapy . The reason interest GCF/serum level resistin periodontitis lie fact epidemiological research indicate periodontitis interplay obesity diabetes mellitus . It possible raise level resistin periodontitis explain least part link periodontitis chronic inflammatory disease . Therefore , overall aim systematic review provide evidence resistin biomarker chronic periodontal disease might underpin relationship periodontal disease , diabetes obesity . Evidence case-control study summarize evaluate .</detailed_description>
