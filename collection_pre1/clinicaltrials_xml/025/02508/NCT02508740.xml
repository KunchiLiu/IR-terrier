	<brief_title>Single Oral Dose Bevenopran Patients With Varying Degrees Renal Impairment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) draft guidance renal impairment study advise performance PK study patient renal impairment medication primarily excrete urine also medication primarily metabolize secrete bile . The major route excretion bevenopran animal identify hepatobiliary renal . In addition , preliminary finding show &gt; 40 % oral bevenopran dose eliminate unchanged urine 48-72 hour period post-dose . This Phase 1 , non-randomized , parallel group , open-label study characterize effect renal function PK bevenopran 1 study center . At screening , eligible subject enrol assign 1 5 parallel study group approximately 8 12 subject base classification renal function use estimate glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) Modification Diet Renal Disease ( MDRD ) Study , present FDA guidance renal impairment study . There 5 study group base eGFRs .</detailed_description>
