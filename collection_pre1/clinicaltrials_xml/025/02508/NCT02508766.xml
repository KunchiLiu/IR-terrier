	<brief_summary>The primary purpose study examine immediate effect manual stimulation foot plant static dynamic balance young healthy subject . In addition , secondary objective study : 1 ) identify whether manual stimulation foot plant healthy young subject , carry easily reproducible protocol 10 minute duration , improve static balance , measure Unipedal Stance Test ; 2 ) ass whether , manual stimulation foot plant healthy young subject , carry easily reproducible protocol 10 minute duration , improve dynamic balance test , measure Star Excursion Balance Test .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Methods Participants Participants University Valencia ( Spain ) ask volunteer participate study . Patients include university student able willing complete protocol . Participants exclude â‰¥40 years-old know musculoskeletal low extremity injury ( eg , postoperative condition , musculotendinous ligamentous problem ) , previous history neurological problem , balance disorder ( eg , vestibular visual problem ) type physical activity programme balance exercise perform . Study design We conduct randomize single-blind control study investigation . A non-stratified randomization list generate hold centrally sealed envelope . Therefore , participant randomly assign experimental group , receive plantar stimulation right foot , control group , receive intervention . Intervention Plantar stimulation In addition , plantar stimulation direct plantar surface dominant foot perform experienced physiotherapist , describe . Participants perform one practice trial plantar stimulation prior performance . The manipulation perform subject supine position . The intervention last ten minute consist four stage : 5 glide pressure focus interdigital space internal longitudinal arch foot caudal direction , last 10 second duration , ( 2 ) 5 compression-decompression metatarsophalangeal joint , slight tension perceive researcher joint , ( 3 ) 5 glide pressure apply 5 second , region metatarsal head , ( 4 ) 5 static pressure apply 10 second , focus four point sole : head first fifth metatarsal head , heel medial side midfoot ( Figure 3 ) . Duration pressure assess use on-line metronome . Furthermore , pressure , static glide , measure strength dynamometer mean force pressure 48N . After stimulation , give negative effect sudden standing-up several study result , participant stand quietly 20 second balance test .</detailed_description>
