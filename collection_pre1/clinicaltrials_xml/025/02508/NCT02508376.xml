	<brief_summary>This phase I randomize , double blind clinical trial design evaluate safety , tolerability immunogenicity ID93 recombinant protein antigen alone formulate GLA-SE AP10-602 adjuvant 70 healthy adult 18-49 year age . Subjects receive total 3 dos administer intramuscularly Days 1 , 29 57 . Subjects monitor approximately 422 day ( 365 day follow third study injection ) , include safety laboratory analyse do prior 7 day follow study injection . Blood sample obtain immunological assay ( Luminex , intracellular cytokine stain Days 1 71 , antibody analysis Days 1 85 ) . The primary objective evaluate safety tolerability 10 µg ID93 + 5 10 µg AP10-602 compare 10 µg ID93 + 5 µg GLA-SE 10 µg ID93 alone follow three consecutive intramuscular injection administer Days 1 , 29 57 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>TB cause significant morbidity mortality throughout world . Strains Mtb become increasingly resistant antimycobacterial drug therapy often associate poor compliance , increase likelihood antimicrobial resistance . The current licensed BCG vaccine prevent reactivation reinfection adult great need effective vaccine . ID93 recombinant antigen , mixed adjuvant GLA-SE AP10-602 , show great promise elicit think important Th1 T cell response limit bacterial burden Mtb challenge animal . This study phase I randomize , double blind clinical trial design evaluate safety , tolerability immunogenicity ID93 recombinant protein antigen alone formulate GLA-SE AP10-602 . This study enroll 70 healthy male non-pregnant female subject , age 18 49 . Subjects meet eligibility criterion randomize ID93 alone , ID93 + GLA-SE , ID93 + AP10-602 either dose level . Study injection perform subject observe clinic 30 minute . All subject complete write subject memory aid solicit local systemic reactogenicity adverse event 7 day follow study injection . After subject reevaluate ensure continue meet eligibility criterion undergo second third study injection Days 29 57 . General safety evaluate Days 1 , 3 , 8 , 29 , 31 , 36 , 57 , 59 , 64 , 71 , 85 , 169 , 422 subject . The occurrence serious adverse event new onset adverse event special interest ( AESI ) collect throughout study period ( approximately 422 day ) . Each subject 's duration participation 15 month . The Primary Objective : To evaluate safety tolerability 10 µg ID93 + 5 10 µg AP10-602 compare 10 µg ID93 + 5 µg GLA-SE 10 µg ID93 alone follow three consecutive intramuscular injection administer Days 1 , 29 57 . The Secondary Objective : To assess immunogenicity 10 µg ID93 + 5 10 µg AP10-602 compare 10 µg ID93 + 5 µg GLA-SE 10 µg ID93 alone quantify T cell response IgG antibody responses ID93 specify time point .</detailed_description>
