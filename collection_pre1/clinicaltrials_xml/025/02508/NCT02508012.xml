	<brief_summary>Since appearance decade ago , anti-tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) inhibitor demonstrate beneficial activity treatment inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) . However , one-third patient present primary resistance , one third become resistant time . One main factor associate loss response immunogenicity anti-TNF biologics lead production antibody targetting TNF inhibitor , namely anti-drug antibody ( ADAbs ) , accelerate drug elimination serum decrease therapeutic activity . In study investigator propose medico-economic evaluation mesurement anti-TNF agent anti-drug antibody serum concentration management patient inflammatory bowel disease treat anti-TNFalpha inhibitor . 280 patient Crohn 's disease ( CD ) ulcerative colitis ( UC ) include randomized 2 group without drug ADAbs monitoring . In monitored group , case loss response , clinician use biological information adapt treatment follow simple treatment algorithm . In unmonitored group , drug ADAbs measurement transmit clinician . Clinical economical benefit biological monitoring evaluate follow-up period two year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>280 patient Crohn 's disease ( CD ) ulcerative colitis ( UC ) recruted 13 french center randomize 2 group without drug ADAbs monitoring . Anti-TNF inhibitor ADAbs simultaneously measure patient serum ELISA ( LisaTracker - Theradiag ) week 6 24 , month 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 20 24 . In unmonitored group , drug ADAbs measurement transmit clinician . In monitored group , case loss response clinician use immunomonitoring data adapt treatment follow simple treatment algorithm : - loss response therapeutic serum trough level anti-TNF switch another biologic - loss response subtherapeutic serum trough level anti-TNF without dectectable ADAbs increase dose and/or shorten interval infusion - loss rsponse subtherapeutic serum trough level anti-TNF dectectable ADAbs switch another anti-TNF inefficient switch another biologic . Clinical economical benefit biological monitoring evaluate follow-up period two year : - primary outcome : Cost-utility analysis immunomonitoring strategy use incremental cost effectivness ratio - secondary outcome : Evaluation quality life ( IBDQ score )</detailed_description>
