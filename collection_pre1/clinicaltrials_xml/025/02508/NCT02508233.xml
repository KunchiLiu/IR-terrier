	<brief_title>Cross-cultural Adaptation Validation Ankle Osteoarthritis Scale ( AOS ) Use French-speaking Populations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Power sample size calculation The required number patient estimate base quality assess . The reproducibility ( test-retest ) questionnaire one main property assess low acceptable limit .85 . However , know reproducibility English version .97 , investigator estimate French version would least .90 . A sample 10 patient would sufficient obtain power 99 % reproducibility .901,9 . Regarding validity , investigator wish obtain statistically significant correlation three select test . The investigator hypothesize low correlation AOS-Fr SF-36 questionnaire would provide low correlation , SF-36 specific ankle OA . By estimate average correlation .50 , 30 patient require obtain significant correlation power 80 % p &lt; .051,9 . Translation The study approve local ethic committee ( protocol # 09-130 ) . Following guideline cross cultural adaptation process write American Association Orthopaedic Surgeons ( AAOS ) 2000 , translation perform use six-step process 2 : 1 ) Initial translation ; 2 ) Synthesis ; 3 ) Back translation ; 4 ) Expert committee ; 5 ) Test Pre-final version ; 6 ) Submission document developer . For `` Initial translation '' , two independent translator whose mother tongue French translate scale English French . The second step `` Synthesis '' require two translator meet , discus compose synthesise version AOS . Two independent translator , blind original scale , whose mother tongue English , translate synthesise version back English . An `` Expert committee '' compose linguist , two orthopaedic surgeon four translator revise whole process consolidate pre-final version . The `` Test Pre-final version '' perform use 60 subject , ankle osteoarthritis , answer questionnaire evaluate comprehension item . From data collect step , section test change improve comprehension readability . For final step investigator submit corrected version Dr. Charles Saltzman , developer English version , approve translation use ( Supplementary data 1 ) . Evaluation psychometric property In order validate use French AOS version , investigator set evaluate psychometric property test ankle osteoarthritis patient use process original study validate English version AOS 6 . Patients isolated ankle degenerative change orthopaedic outpatient clinic Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Sherbrooke ( CHUS ) include . To include , patient consider French mother tongue able read write French . Patients 18 year old additional foot and/or ankle pathology exclude . At first visit , socio-demographic data ( age , sex , BMI , occupation ) pertinent past medical history ( Diabetes , neuropathy , ankle foot fracture ) ) collect patient ask perform single heel lift test affect unaffected side . The participant complete three questionnaire : AOS-French version , SF-36 , WOMAC . Criterion validity assess compare AOS WOMAC SF-36 score . Construct validity establish examination correlation AOS score single heel lift test . Finally , measure test-retest reliability , patient ask complete AOS second time small questionnaire detail modification treatment ( shoe , orthotics , medication , surgery , injection ) one week follow first visit return mail . Any modification treatment completion two AOS questionnaire would nullify test-retest reliability , patient would exclude analysis .</detailed_description>
