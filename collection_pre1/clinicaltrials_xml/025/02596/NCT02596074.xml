At least one lesion accurately measure ( use RECIST criterion ) least one dimension long diameter ≥ 20mm OR two perpendicular dimension multiply together give surface area ≥ 120mm2 ( e.g . 15mm x 8mm 12mm x 10mm ) This ensure 4x4mm biopsy perform lesion . 1 . Has concomitant disease significant medical condition would , opinion Investigator , potentially compromise safety compliance patient may preclude patient 's successful completion clinical trial . 2 .
