	<brief_summary>The overall goal IQ-MAPLE project improve quality care provide patient several heart , lung blood condition facilitate accurate complete problem list documentation . In first aim , investigator design validate series problem inference algorithm , use rule-based technique structure data electronic health record ( EHR ) natural language processing unstructured data . Both technique yield candidate problem patient likely , result integrate . In Aim 2 , investigator design clinical decision support intervention EHRs four study site alert physician candidate problem detect miss patient 's problem list - clinician able accept alert add problem , override alert , ignore entirely . In Aim 3 , investigator conduct randomize trial evaluate effect problem list alert three endpoint : alert acceptance , problem list addition rate clinical quality .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The clinical problem list cornerstone problem-oriented medical record . Problem list use variety way throughout process clinical care . In addition use clinician , problem list also critical decision support quality measurement . Patients gap problem list face significant risk . For example , hypothetical patient diabetes properly document , clinician would receive appropriate alert reminder guide care . Additionally , patient might include special care management program quality care provide would measure track . Without diabetes problem list , might receive none benefit . In study , investigator develop clinical decision support intervention identify patient problem list gap . The investigator alert provider likely gap offer provider opportunity correct . In first aim , investigator design validate series problem inference algorithm , use rule-based technique structure data electronic health record ( EHR ) natural language processing unstructured data . Both technique yield candidate problem patient likely , result integrate . In Aim 2 , investigator design clinical decision support intervention EHRs four study site alert physician candidate problem detect miss patient 's problem list - clinician able accept alert add problem , override alert , ignore entirely . In Aim 3 , investigator conduct randomize trial evaluate effect problem list alert three endpoint : alert acceptance , problem list addition rate clinical quality .</detailed_description>
