	<brief_title>Titration PEEP During Mechanical Ventilation Patients With ARDS Using Electrical Impedance Tomography .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently , clinical practice regard positive end expiratory pressure ( PEEP ) strategies Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ( ARDS ) revolve around two PEEP/FIO2 algorithm develop NHLBI research ARDSnet program . These two algorithm know `` High '' PEEP/ low FIO2 `` Low '' PEEP/ high FIO2 protocol . The High PEEP/ low FIO2 protocol see aggressive high PEEP level clinician would want set , low PEEP/ high FIO2 see low PEEP level clinician would set . While many study demonstrate safety efficacy PEEP setting base require fraction inspire oxygen ( FIO2 ) maintain adequate oxygenation , yet equal outcome two strategy . There grow evidence Low PEEP/ high FIO2 protocol leave large proportion lung derecruited High PEEP/FIO2 protocol may create overdistension compliant section lung largely free disease use single gas exchange ( oxygenation ) parameter determine PEEP setting . Specific Aim 1 : To demonstrate safety EIT guide PEEP titration strategy . ( Hypothesis : EIT guide titration PEEP improve ventilation oxygenation without increase incidence barotrauma hemodynamic compromise . ) Specific Aim 2 : To demonstrate efficacy PEEP titration strategy increase distribution ventilation improve oxygenation child ARDS utilize EIT guide protocol within two standard care . ( Hypothesis : EIT guide titration PEEP lead homogeneous distribution ventilation , improve lung compliance improve ventilation oxygenation . ) Background Significance Lung unit participate gas exchange know 'recruited ' lung . Patients lung injury suffer proportion lung unit participate gas exchange ( i.e . derecruited state ) , time result impaired gas exchange . Derecruitment alveolus may also cause intrapulmonary shunt worsen lung injury atelectotrauma . Outcomes ARDS improve significantly since clinician begin employ lung protective strategy , include low-tidal volume ventilation permissive hypercapnea . However , low-tidal volume ventilation recognize decrease recruit lung volume , phenomenon persists despite aggressive positive end-expiratory pressure ( PEEP ) strategy employ ARDSNet study . Atelectasis associate low-tidal volume ventilation relieve use so-called sigh breath , high level PEEP recruitment maneuverer . Further , proportion lung remain derecruited state may contribute morbidity mortality associate ARDS . In adult , several strategy utilize recruit lung : sustain inflation ( SI ) maximal recruitment strategy . The so-called open lung approach ( OLA ) include SI follow set PEEP measure low inflection point PV curve . An alternative approach set PEEP decremental PEEP titration , include sequential lower PEEP predetermine decrement PaO2 SaO2 occur . The impact lung recruitment long-term course ARDS yet clear . It clear lung recruitment effective early course ARDS . Grasso et al demonstrated patient receive recruitment maneuver day 1±0.3 ARDS could recruit , versus patient recruit day 7±1 . Similarly , Gattinoni et al7 Crotti et al find limited recruitment patient well along course ARDS . Borges et al , Tugrul et al , Girgis et al recruit patient early course ARDS , find mark lung recruitment , average , patient study . Each study demonstrated ability improve oxygen saturation ( sometimes study ) end-expiratory lung volume . While study examine effect change morbidity mortality , child hypoxemia know common cause morbidity . Importantly child , treatment hypoxia often drive escalate ventilator setting , use high frequency oscillatory ventilation ( HFOV ) use extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation ( ECMO ) . Early recruitment proper titration PEEP child ARDS may prevent need escalation care towards invasive , risk-imposing therapy . Electrical Impedance Tomography ( EIT ) Barber Brown introduce electrical impedance tomography medical community early 1980s . From wide spectrum application medicine range gastric emptying , brain function , breast imaging , lung function explore . It belief valuable benefit EIT monitoring regional lung function critically ill patient . Early EIT device fell susceptible poor sensitivity signal interference clinical setting . After year renew interest commercial company interested ventilation technology , many shortcoming resolve . As new modality , EIT clinical utility application need methodically explore ; therefore propose IRB protocol take u step close journey develop clinically useful tool . Electrical impedance tomography capitalize change electrical impendence air-filled versus tissue fluid-filled space order characterize quantify regional distribution lung volume bedside . This technology validate animal human study . The technology utilizes series 16 electrode place across patient 's chest . As small current , undetectable subject , pass electrode , impedance measure amongst series . Through complex interrogation manipulation impedance value , two-dimensional image form , show correlate clinical radiographic change patient . The ability estimate lung volume regional distribution gas non-invasively real time may give u insight mode ventilation set effective optimize positive pressure ventilation .</detailed_description>
