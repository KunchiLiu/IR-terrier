	<brief_summary>An adaptation cold environment tendency generate heat within body . Some heat come fat tissue . Although fat tissue `` white fat '' , pocket deep within body call `` brown fat '' , specially adapt burning fat make heat . The investigator believe white fat , underneath surface skin , also property burn fat make heat , although high level brown fat . This study examine fat-burning property white fat skin response season cold . Many study do mouse , little do human . There number factor , include age , weight , medical history , may make person eligible ineligible participate study . Certain medication could make person ineligible , medication safely alter , individual may become eligible .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Metabolic syndrome condition involve elevated level fat blood , tendency towards diabetes , hypertension , much fat around abdomen ( increased waistline ) . Individuals metabolic syndrome often impaired glucose tolerance , condition blood sugar normal person eats , high drinking sugary drink . This due abnormality body 's sensitivity insulin ( insulin resistance ) , due part inability muscle take glucose . People metabolic syndrome inflammation fat tissue inflammation fat tissue may impair ability white fat burn fat continue promote obesity . This study involve three arm . A propranolol biopsy arm , heavy water biopsy arm , biopsy arm . The goal understand response fat cold , either acutely , repeat cold exposure , response change season . Individuals ( subject ) accept study report UK Center Clinical Translational Science ( CCTS ) research unit baseline test repeat procedure . Participants ask procedure do approximately 6 month later . Subjects enrol study need come CCTS Unit multiple visit . Most visit le 1 hour , 6 visit involve procedure vary time range 4 hour 6 hour . If subject participates aspect study ( fat biopsy multiple depot , short term , long term , season , total participation approximately 28 visit 6-7 month . However , subject , participation involve few visit , discretion principal investigator . The first visit involve consent process , follow baseline fasting blood sample oral glucose tolerance test . If subject pass screen procedure , subsequent visit involve fat biopsy , DEXA , visit describe . Fat biopsy ( Visits 2 , 14 , 17 28 ) . Regardless study arm assign subject present CCTS fast baseline fat biopsy perform thigh low abdomen . Abdominal thigh subcutaneous adipose tissue remove incision local anesthesia . An ice pack place opposite thigh low abdomen 30 min ; 4 hr later , adipose biopsy obtain iced area . The subject report CCTS daily repeat 30 min ice pack procedure . However , discretion PI , participant may able perform 30 min ice pack procedure home . On day 7 day 14 , subject report CCTS fasting procedure repeat : ice pack place thigh abdomen 30 min , fat biopsy take iced area non-iced area 4 hr later . Propranolol Arm : Subjects qualify subgroup give propranolol 10 mg three time per day . If tolerate medication well side effect , 5 day , increase dose 20 mg three time per day . If tolerate 20 mg dose well side effect , another 5 day ( day 10 ) , increase dose 40 mg three time per day stay duration study . Heavy Water Arm : Subjects qualify subgroup give heavy water ( visit 2 ) every 3 hour next 12 hour CCTS . They send home dos heavy water seal sterile vial , take one vial heavy water twice per day 5 week . The following test procedure perform subject : Glucose tolerance test ( Visits 1 15 ) . This standard oral glucose tolerance test use 75 g glucose , blood glucose insulin drawn time 1 , 30 , 60 , 90 , 120 min . Resting metabolic rate . The investigator measure rest metabolic rate ( RMR ) . RMR measure early morning , fasting , room CCTS . DEXA . Body composition measure DEXA . 12-Lead ECG : To examine heart rhythm heart rate evidence previous heart disease . Urine Collection : Females capable become pregnant also give urine pregnancy test . If test result show pregnant able participate study . Unscheduled Visits : During study either subject PI feel subject see additional visit due adverse event , study staff arrange visit . This visit take 30 minute . During visit investigator : - Review subject 's current medication use , include counter medication herbal . - Ask subject question health problem may since last visit . - If necessary , take blood sample ( 1 tablespoon ) urine sample ( 6 teaspoon ) monitor subject 's general health . - If necessary , perform ECG measure blood pressure pulse . - If necessary , ask question study drug dosing home . After complete procedure , subject ask come back set procedure follow season ( i.e . winter , original procedure summer , vice versa ) . Therefore , subject complete procedure season , total 16 biopsy perform . Following initial study , investigator may refine protocol take few biopsy . For example , early experiment determine abdominal fat responsive season , investigator may discontinue procedure . The investigator may determine baseline fat biopsy ( prior icing ) unnecessary .</detailed_description>
