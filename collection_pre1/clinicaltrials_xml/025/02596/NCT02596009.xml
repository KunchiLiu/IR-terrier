	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare dynamic inspiratory flow rate achieve population Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) patient Breezhaler® , Ellipta® Handihaler® dry powder inhaler ( DPI ) device . No active drug placebo administer patient study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Inspiratory Flow Rates Achieved COPD Patients Through Breezhaler® , Ellipta® Handihaler® Inhaler Devices</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The inspiratory flow rate achieve COPD patient , via breath actuate device , one important factor influence efficiency drug delivery inhalation route . The peak inspiratory flow ( PIF ) rate achieve COPD patient different breath actuate dry power inhaler may differ difference internal resistance different type device . The result inspiratory airflow rate pressure drop time , study , provide assessment range variability inhalation profile characteristic generate COPD patient within population select study ( e.g . demographic , gender , disease control ) Breezhaler market comparator DPIs . The inhalation profile obtain Inhalation Profile Recorder ( IPR ) . The inhalation profile recorder data acquisition device consist computer , interface unit pressure transducer . This allow able measure real time dynamic pressure drop mouthpiece inhaler inhalation maneuver . On graphic user interface , plots inspiratory pressure drop versus time flow rate versus time display real time . The investigator designate study personnel site responsible type Test Location , select Inhaler Type ( Breezhaler , Ellipta , Handihaler ) , type Patient ID Patient Age , select Male Female , record Patient Comments make test session , necessary . Each patient require generate three ( 03 ) inhalational profile three ( 03 ) study device : Breezhaler® , Ellipta® Handihaler® .</detailed_description>
