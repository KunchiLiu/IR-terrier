	<brief_title>Hypoalgesic Effect Median Nerve Neural Mobilization Compared Controlled Group</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Median Nerve Neural Mobilization ( MNNM ) non invasive physical therapy technique achieve pain relief mechanical stimulation Median Nerve brachial plexus . It believe hypoalgesic effect offer neural tissue mobilization procedure consequence descend nervous system pain modulation activity improvement distinct biomechanical sensitive property involve neural tissue . The neural tissue mobilization procedure associate increase nerve mobility , edema , inflammation intraneural pressure reduction without know side effect apply properly important contrast wide variety side effect cause commonly use drug therapy treat cervicobrachial pain . Despite crescent interest among scientific community evidence base option treat pain current lack enough control double blind clinical trial measure effectiveness neural tissue mobilization technique ( MNNM ) specific effect cervicobrachial pain . For reason present investigation consist application treatment protocol base Median Nerve Neural Mobilization control double blind clinical trial aim assess clinical effectiveness treat pain symptom .</detailed_description>
