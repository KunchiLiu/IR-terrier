	<brief_summary>Infrared meibography useful technique evaluation meibomian gland disease ( MGD ) . MGD major cause dry eye symptom , affect large number patient see Corneo-Plastic Unit ( CPU ) . Many parameter use evaluate MGD include tear film break-up time , lid margin abnormality , Schirmer tear test value . Direct visualization meibomian gland infrared meibography show correlate well parameter . Although infrared meibography develop 30 year ago , widely use . This probably due need special equipment , examiner time expertise patient discomfort examination . Analysis acquire image also need video review extraction video still - time-consuming process . Investigators aim pilot rapid non-contact ( non-painful ) method obtain infrared image meibomian gland use equipment already available QVH . This pilot study validate technique check patient acceptability . Investigators hopeful test could use useful tool future research dry eye condition MGD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients receive patient information sheet post Eye Clinic appointment letter . To clear , point list would form standard care dry eye patient attend clinic , apart additional infrared photographic image take study ( point 6 ) . In Consultation room , study explain participant one investigator . If agree participate , consent form sign participant investigator . They question regard absence presence ocular symptom use previously validate accept score scale ( Ocular Surface Disease Index - OSDI ) . This questionnaire allow patient score degree dry eye symptom . Participants undergo : 1 . Schirmers tear test production . 2 . Clinical slit lamp examination look abnormality upper low lid margin . 3 . Fluorescein stain ocular surface ( divide 3 zone comprise nasal conjunctival , corneal , temporal conjunctival area ) . 4 . Observation tear film break-up time ( TBUT ) . 5 . Digital pressure apply upper tarsus , degree ease meibomian secretion ( meibum ) induce , evaluate semi-quantitatively . Eversion upper low eyelid clinic part standard ocular examination . 6 . In photography department , upper low eyelid evert non-contact infrared photograph take . Partial complete loss Meibomian glands score accord meiboscore eyelid . After image take , patient experience gather five-point Lickert scale score sheet . Outcome measure To examine correlation morphologic change meibomian gland visible infrared photography clinical examination finding questionnaire score regard eyelid tear film function population . To assess patient experience acceptability intervention . 4.0 Selection withdrawal Subjects 4.1 Inclusion criterion Patients attend CPU offer opportunity take part comply follow : - Over 18 year age - Able give inform consent 4.2 Exclusion criterion : - Patients age 18 year age - Poor understanding language - Ocular allergy - History contact lens wear - History eye eyelid surgery - Systemic ocular disease may interfere tear film production function . - Use systemic medication tetracycline derivative , antihistamine , isotretinoin , nutritional supplement MGD . - Use topical ciclosporin-A steroid begin within last month . - Refusal patient 's GP inform participation . 5.0 Treatment subject Participants undergo standard care Corneo-Plastic Unit , also examine photograph infrared technique . 6.0 Assessment Efficacy Through assessment describe , statistical analysis OSDI score , ocular surface Meibomian gland score possible . We analyse finding see relationship patient symptom level Meibomian gland dysfunction . 7.0 Assessment Safety Any side effect report patient and/or observe clinician record . Data regard patient experience test also collect .</detailed_description>
