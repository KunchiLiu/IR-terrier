	<brief_summary>Current study suggest alveolar macrophage ( AM ) act silencer immune response lung . However , pathological condition , asthma , hypersensitivity pneumonitis , sarcoidosis , AMs become involved maintenance expansion immune response target organ . The Investigator preliminary data demonstrate CBD AMs site disease involvement ( bronchoalveolar lavage , BAL ) display activate cell surface phenotype compare AMs healthy control . Furthermore , excite data group demonstrate significant difference gene expression profile CBD Beryllium Sensitivity ( BeS ) bronchial alveolar lavage ( BAL ) cell , pivotal immune response gene network . Specifically , Investigator find JAK/STAT pathway JAK2 gene dramatically overexpressed CBD BAL cell . In addition , constitutively phosphorylated JAK2 ( pJAK2 ) find AMs Chronic Beryllium Disease ( CBD ) patient Westernblot increase beryllium ( Be ) stimulation 30 min . Moreover , JAK2 inhibitor TG101348 significantly inhibit Be-induced CBD AMs TNFa IFNy production . Meanwhile , overexpression JAK2 inhibitor SOCS 1 ( suppressor cytokine signal ) protein decrease Be-induced TNFa production AMs . Based information , Investigator hypothesize CBD AMs overexpress JAK2 , augment immune response Be development CBD BeS . The investigator believe study highly innovative since undoubtedly shed light exposure-mediated immune dysregulation Alveolar Macrophages ( AMs ) lead disease development likely progression additional study pathway reveal potential biomarkers clinical prognosis diagnosis . The result obtain study improve investigator understand factor involve development Chronic Beryllium disease ( CBD ) , well define target therapy , serve model exposure-related immune response environmentally-induced chronic disease . Most importantly , study provide investigator preliminary data submit high quality R01 , allow Investigator apply similar approach gene , define potential target similar immune-mediated disease continue research effort National Jewish Health ( NJH . )</brief_summary>
