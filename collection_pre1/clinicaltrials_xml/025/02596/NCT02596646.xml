	<detailed_description>In prospective multicenter randomize clinical trial investigator assign patient refer therapeutic biliary ERCP difficult biliary cannulation ( unsuccessful cannulation 5 minute ) early precut ( group A ) repeat papillary cannulation attempt follow , case failure , late precut ( group B ) . Group A patient undergo precut immediately randomization ( `` early precut '' ) , group B cannulation attempt continue another 10 minute , precut do fail three unintended additional passage guide-wire MPD ( `` delay precut '' ) .</detailed_description>
