	<brief_title>Œùew Molecular Biomarkers Prevention Early Detection Precancerous Cancerous Colorectal Lesions During Screening Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) third frequent cancer worldwide prevalence 1.5 million people / year second cause death cancer ( 650 000 death per year ) gender lung cancer . In Greece estimate 3000 people infect annually CRC . Risk factor emergence CRC : old age , positive family history cancer colon polyp , diet poor fiber rich high-calorie fat food , sedentary lifestyle lack exercise everyday life . Additionally , obesity , smoking , alcohol consumption large quantity , diabetes , inflammatory condition intestine ulcerative colitis Crohn 's Crohn , inherit disorder affect colon factor increase risk CRC . It silent insidious disease since patient present symptom early stage ( bleed , abdominal pain ) , result diagnosis non-curable phase . This make clear survival depend stage disease time diagnosis . For example patient cancer Dukes ' stage A , 5-year survival 93 % whereas stage C , 47 % . Based clear early detection precancerous colorectal lesion cornerstone optimal treatment disease . The CRC ideally disease implement mass screen general population follow specific development process last 7-12 year , lead transformation normal epithelium adenoma eventually carcinoma . There multiple option available CRC detection involve detection blood fecal test ( microscopic examination fecal hemoglobin ) , flexible sigmoidoscopy colonoscopy . Each advantage disadvantage . Specifically , microscopic examination fecal hemoglobin although reduces mortality 16 % CRC nevertheless exhibit low sensitivity detect polyp cancerous lesion distal colon small specificity thus , economic term , negative test use mass screen . Regarding flexible sigmoidoscopy , test clearly faster safer colonoscopy small percentage patient compliance , efficacy clear depend quality bowel preparation importantly , see whole intestine . Computed tomographic colonography another method find new precancerous lesion short diagnostic accuracy compare colonoscopy radiation , recommend mass screening . A colonoscopy best method diagnosis polyp CRC date , also prevent CRC detect adenomatous polyp polypectomy . It allow inspection entire lumen colon result distal proximal lesion discover . He great sensitivity method detection CRC . The disadvantage method cost , bowel perforation bleed risk ( especially polypectomy ) , difficulty preparation patient use laxative liquid , need sedation procedure , low level compliance patient intolerance . It become necessary identify simpler , less invasive affordable method find precancerous lesion sporadic type CRC . One method use potential biomarkers ( i.e . objectively measurable indicator normal abnormal process ) use sample blood ( plasma ) person order find mutation epigenetic change know gene implicate participate process carcinogenesis CRC . More specific , least three main path lead carcinogenesis colorectal lesion : way chromosomal instability ( CIN ) , path microsatellite instability ( MSI ) finally path methylated phenotype island cytosine-phosphate-guanine ( CpG island ) know CpG Island Methylation Pathway ( CIMP ) . After long-term study , find every path participation gene mutation and/or epigenetic change . For example path chromosomal abnormality gather point mutation oncogene tumor suppress gene APC , KRAS , BRAF , SMAD 4 , TP53 . The route microsatellite instability , result malfunction DNA repair gene ( DNA mismatch repair gene -MMR ) , lead multiple mutation cause 15 % sporadic type CRC abnormal epigenetic methylation MLH1gene . Eventually , third path , CIMP , consist two subtypes : first associate mutation BRAF gene , know CIMP-High , second associate mutation KRAS gene , know , CIMP-Low . Additionally , presence circulate nucleic acid ( circulate cell-free DNA ) blood circulation cancer patient lead belief nucleic acid derive cancerous cell therefore may use early detection precancerous cancerous colorectal lesion . Therefore become increasingly strong need find new biomarkers lead u low cost safety , closer precancerous colon lesion , treat one important health problem century . Based , design prospective study evaluate predictive ability detection mutation gene involve carcinogenesis colon ( eg hMLH1 , K-Ras , B-Raf , ccfDNA ) sample Greek population present conduct colonoscopy context screen international CRC prevention instruction . This investigation carry individual normal risk order study specific mutation ( blood tissue ) draw reliable conclusion whether detect ( great sensitivity specificity ) patient precancerous lesion CRC simple blood test thereby reduce cost side effect repeat endoscopic procedure . The sample study consist approximately 90-100 individual normal risk develop CRC age 50-75 year , undergo preventive colonoscopy polyp CRC detection . Participants divide three group patient accord finding endoscopy : without pathological finding , polyp 1 3 centimeter diameter adenomatous element pathology examination finally colorectal cancer . From three population , sample would collect peripheral blood ( plasma ) colon tissue biopsy ( normal abnormal , respectively ) order find possible common mutation gene involve pathogenesis CRC 3 group [ e.g . KRAS12 , 13 , 61 , BRAF ( V600E ) , ccfDNA point mutation hMLH1 ] . The sample blood tissue place blood bottle specific anticoagulant preservative ( RNA latter ) subsequently store -20 degree maintenance . The genome analysis potential mutation do specific commercial DNA kit specific PCR technique . Then accord result , carry try present statistically significant element compatible original purpose investigation . The effectiveness screening program depend accuracy acceptability method use detect pathological condition . An ideal screening test high compliance , high sensitivity specificity , minimally invasive cost-efficient . Because limitation exist colon cancer screen method grow need find new diagnostic method precancerous lesion one molecular biomarkers valuable tool arsenal safe approach healthy subject high risk CRC .</detailed_description>
