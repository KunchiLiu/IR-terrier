	<detailed_description>Plague potentially fatal infection human cause bacterium Yersinia pestis , transmit naturally rodent reservoir human via flea . Human diseases may also result contact blood tissue infect animal exposure aerosolize droplet contain bacteria . Pneumonic plague typically diagnosed human high mortality . It long history plague agent biowarfare , pose serious threat international security . In human history , three outbreak plague world , 200 million people died disease . The increase trend plague epidemic recent year , region country world still outbreak plague . It imply safe effective vaccine urgently develop . Althought kill whole-cell plague vaccine live attenuate vaccine license , vaccine cause significant adverse reaction , include fever , headache , malaise , lymphadenopathy , erythema induration injection site high degree immune variability . They rarely use today toxicity , limited evidence efficacy prevent plague , limited commercial availability . Based research last twenty year , recombinant subunit vaccine comprise fraction 1 capsule ( F1 ) virulence-associated ( V ) antigens main composition cause widely attention provide great protection vaccine comprise either subunit alone . This study aim explore safety immunogenicity new type plague subunit vaccine comprise native F1 antigen recombine V antigen ( F1+rV ) .</detailed_description>
