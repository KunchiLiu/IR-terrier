	<brief_summary>This IND-exempt Phase I trial establish recommend Phase II ( RP2D ) dose eribulin combination fix dose oral irinotecan adolescent young adult relapse refractory solid tumor . Eribulin administer intravenously day 1 8 21-day cycle , irinotecan administer orally day 1-5 . Patients assign eribulin dose level time enrollment use 3+3 Phase I design , intrapatient dose escalation . Once RP2D establish , 10 patient enrol dose expansion cohort . In absence disease progression toxicity , subject may receive 17 cycle therapy .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients must ≥13 ≤30 year age time study entry Patients must histologically confirm solid tumor malignancy either original diagnosis relapse curative therapy exist , either recur progress least one prior systemic therapy . Patients primary brain tumor , brain metastasis time potential enrollment , exclude . Additionally , patient GIST , alveolar soft part sarcoma , dematofibrosarcoma protuberans exclude . Patients must either measurable evaluable disease , Performance Level : ECOG performance status ≤ 2 ( Karnofsky ≥60 % , see Appendix A ) . Note : Patients unable walk paralysis , wheelchair , consider ambulatory purpose assess performance score . Prior Therapy : No limit place number prior therapy . Prior treatment irinotecan eribulin allow , although patient must receive coadministration eribulin irinotecan must disease progression receive either eribulin irinotecan . Patients must fully recover acute toxic effect prior chemotherapy , immunotherapy , radiotherapy prior enter study . Myelosuppressive chemotherapy : Must receive within three week start date protocol chemotherapy ; six week require administration nitrosourea agent . Hematopoietic growth factor : At least 7 day since completion therapy growth factor least 14 day longacting growth factor ( e.g . pegfilgrastim ) Biologic ( antineoplastic agent ) : At least 7 day 3 halflives since completion therapy biologic agent , whichever longer . For agent know adverse event occur beyond 7 day administration , period must extend beyond time adverse event expect occur . The duration interval must discuss PI study . Immunotherapy : At least 6 week since completion type immunotherapy ( e.g . tumor vaccine ) . Monoclonal antibody : At least 3 halflives must elapse since prior therapy include monoclonal antibody . Radiotherapy : ≥ 2 week local palliative XRT ( small port ) ; ≥ 6 month must elapse prior TBI , craniospinal XRT ; ≥ 3 month must elapse ≥ 50 % radiation pelvis ; ≥ 6 week must elapse therapeutic dos MIBG substantial BM irradiation give . Stem Cell Transplant Rescue without TBI : Allogeneic autologous HSCT allow , evidence active graft vs. host disease ≥ 2 month must elapse since infusion . Patients must systemic immunosuppression . Organ Function Requirements : Patients must normal organ marrow function define . Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,000/mcL Platelets ≥ 100,000/mcL ( transfusion independent , define receive platelet transfusion within 7day period prior enrollment ) Hemoglobin ≥ 8.0 g/dl ( may receive RBC transfusion ) . Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × institutional upper limit normal age AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 × institutional upper limit normal Albumin ≥ 2 g/dl Creatinine within normal institutional limit age OR creatinine clearance ≥ 70 mL/min/1.73 m2 patient creatinine level normal EKG QTc ≤480 msec ( CTCAE Grade 2 ) Contraception : Because chemotherapeutic agent may teratogenic , male female childbearing potential must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation 4 month last dose study chemotherapy . Informed Consent : All patient &gt; 18 year must sign write informed consent . Patients &lt; 18 year old must provide assent , parent legal guardian must sign write informed consent . Pregnancy BreastFeeding : Patients pregnant breastfeed eligible study due potential fetal teratogenic toxicity . Negative pregnancy test must obtain female patient postmenarchal . Major surgery within 14 day prior start treatment . No time limitation minor surgery ( eg : core biopsy central line placement ) Current evidence GIST , alveolar soft part sarcoma , dermatofibrosarcoma Concomitant Medications : Growth factor ( ) : Growth factor support platelet white cell number function must administer within 7 day prior enrollment ( 14 day pegfilgrastim ) . Corticosteroids : Patients receive corticosteroid stable decrease dose corticosteroid 7 day prior enrollment eligible . Investigational Drugs : Patients currently receive another investigational drug eligible . Anticancer Agents : Patients currently receive anticancer agent eligible . Enzymeinducing anticonvulsant medication : Patients currently receive enzyme induce anticonvulsant : phenytoin , phenobarbital , carbamazepine , oxcarbazepine eligible . Patients currently take rifampin , voriconazole , itraconazole , ketoconazole , aprepitant , St. John 's Wort eligible . Anticoagulants : Use warfarin allow study . Patients already warfarin use alternative anticoagulant study . Warfarin must administer within 7 day start protocol therapy . Medications prolong QTc : Infection : Patients uncontrolled infection , currently receive treatment C difficile infection . Patients history allergic reaction attribute eribulin irinotecan . Patients document allergy cephalosporin . Patients CNS tumor know brain metastasis . Patients know metastatic tumor bone marrow . Patients opinion investigator may able comply safety monitoring requirement study . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness would limit compliance study requirement . HIVpositive patient combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction eribulin irinotecan . In addition , patient increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy .</criteria>
