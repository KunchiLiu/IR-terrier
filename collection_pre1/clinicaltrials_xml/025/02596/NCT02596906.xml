	<brief_summary>Individuals age 55 old may experience negative effect cognitive decline . The propose research seek evaluate benefit different type intervention : reason train follow transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) reason train follow sham transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) frontal- lobe mediate cognitive measure executive control adults memory complaint , absence dementia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Brain Cognitive Changes After Reasoning Training Individuals With Mild Cognitive Impairment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study evaluate impact reason training individual complaint change memory think absence dementia , combine transcranial current stimulation ( tDCS ) . The reason training study strategy base program individual teach strategy design engage frontal lobe . Participants randomly place one two group ( 1 ) reason train follow transcranial current stimulation ( tDCS ) compare ( 2 ) reason train follow sham tDCS . The study do adult age 50 80 consistent memory complaint low baseline performance memory measure . The primary hypothesis individual receive tDCS prior brain training strong response brain training sham tDCS group . Response training measure improved cognitive function neural change measure neuropsychological testing , MRI , EEG . MRI use evaluate impact reason train brain blood flow , structure function , measure change brain energy metabolism electroencephalogram ( EEG ) evaluate intervention outcome . The reason training program conduct small group Center BrainHealth .</detailed_description>
