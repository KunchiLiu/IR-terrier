To conduct pilot cross-sectional study electronic ( e ) -cigarette ( cig ) user , never-smokers , smoker ( n=30 ) , assess use pattern biomarkers bronchoscopies use bronchoalveolar lavage ( cell count , inflammatory cytokine , untargeted metabolomics ) , bronchial brushing gene expression ( micro ribonucleic acid [ miRNA ] messenger ribonucleic acid [ mRNA ] ) . II . To conduct 4 week pilot clinical trial nicotine-free flavor-free e-cig use regular smokeless tobacco ( ST ) user ( n=30 ) , randomize e-cig use control ( e-cig use ) , assess biomarkers Objective 1 bronchoscopy baseline 4 week product ( week 5 trial ) . OUTLINE : PART I : Patients randomize 1 2 arm . ARM I : Patients undergo bronchoscopy leave lung 30-60 minute . ARM II : Patients undergo bronchoscopy right lung 30-60 minute . PART II : Patients regular ST user randomize 1 2 arm . ARM A : Patients receive nicotine-free flavor-free electronic cigarette instruct use twice daily ( BID ) 2 hour period 4 week .
