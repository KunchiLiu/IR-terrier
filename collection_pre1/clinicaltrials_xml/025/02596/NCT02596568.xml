	<brief_summary>This study attempt use type non-invasive brain stimulation technology sleep improve measure sleep quality memory young healthy student old adult . The type brain stimulation call transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) , use small current electricity increase decrease activity specific area brain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect tDCS Applied During Sleep Memory Consolidation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) safe , non-invasive , inexpensive brain stimulation modality show ability modulate cortical deep brain structure activity . This technique undergone significant amount investigation vary neuropsychiatric population interest technique increase dramatically late . Some researcher study effect modality sleep well memory promising result . One study demonstrate use bilateral tDCS pattern stimulation delta frequency range ( 0-3 Hz ) deliver slow wave sleep , possible increase delta power slow wave sleep , well improve sleep efficiency . In addition show possible enhance slow wave , also demonstrate increase associate improvement measure declarative memory consolidation ( one theorize function slow wave sleep ) . Enhancing memory function normal healthy group raise possibility would also possible enhance memory clinical population would benefit intervention . The investigator propose test intervention replication similar cohort .</detailed_description>
