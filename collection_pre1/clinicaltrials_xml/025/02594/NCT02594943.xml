	<detailed_description>Endodrill newly construct biopsy tool flexible endoscopic use . It use drill motion within case harvest solid biopsy tissue biopsy channel conventional flexible endoscope . It originally design sample tissue submucosal lesion . The investigators´ first study instrument finish . Endodrill safe use generates submucosal tissue compare biopsy conventional biopsy forceps . In study , investigator want compare Endodrill instrument´s ability obtain representative tissue sample group patient diagnose suspect diffuse gastric cancer . 20 patient enrol study . For patient investigator collect 8 biopsy , 4 biopsy conventional biopsy Endodrill instrument respectively . The order randomize patient . For specific biopsy investigator choose particular site suspect tumor tissue without know instrument use biopsy . This procedure repeat 8 biopsy .</detailed_description>
