	<detailed_description>Although functional structural disease identify physician sometimes cure medical technology , non-structural functional symptom , without identify organic cause associate high rate response placebo yet enigmatic less susceptible explanation effective treatment . Often consider non-pathological , physiological sociocultural factor , nociceptive , psychic expand perception symptom experience serious , problematic threaten consequent impact daily activity . Although represent frequent cause consultation specialty Pediatric Gastroenterology currently drug therapy demonstrate effectiveness . In case , unnecessary diagnostic study perform find organic cause , result increase health care cost possibly inappropriate patient care . These type beliefs behavior delegitimize DFG suffering patient . There study say 35 % patient suffer irritable bowel syndrome ( organic cause organic effect ) use complementary therapy , absence clinical trial , emphasize need control study advise / direct patient medical community therapy could adequate . According General Osteopathic Council ( UK ) Osteopathic International Alliance ( OIA ) , Osteopathy health profession dedicate diagnosis , treatment prevention problem musculoskeletal effect nervous system global health . It base theory well-being depends good relationship skeleton , muscle , ligament connective tissue . The lack good relationship lead symptom musculoskeletal problem also visceral . Health see complex process involve part system body . Palpatory technique use diagnose dysfunction physical manipulation use improve function joint , relax muscle tension , promote innervation blood supply tissue help heal mechanism body . There study field Osteopathy evaluate efficacy approach different intestinal dysfunction disease . Da Silva et al demonstrate usefulness increase pressure low esophageal sphincter osteopathic approach patient gastroesophageal reflux . Attali et al suggest visceral osteopathy improves short long term bloat rectal sensitivity patient irritable bowel syndrome . Florance et al report improvement quality life symptomatic improvement patient irritable colon pilot study Piche et al show reduced severity symptom associate irritable bowel patient Crohn 's disease remission . The positive effect osteopathic treatment management symptom cause irritable bowel syndrome confirm couple systematic review recently publish . However , study perform adult patient . On pediatric level , literature focus infant colic . The notable reference Cochrane review 2012 several manipulative therapy evaluate . One weaknesses identify review parent entrust objectify improvement blind . This defect correct subsequent study chiropractor field . The effectiveness osteopathic treatment infantile colic also study always small sample methodological flaw . An example study Hayden et al . Silva et al show use physical therapy ( muscle exercise , breathe abdominal massage ) effective pediatric chronic constipation defecation increase frequency . The scientific evidence regard effectiveness osteopathic treatment digestive disorder adult pediatric patient limit constrain . At time , study pediatric set approach manual therapy abdominal painful functional disorder . OBJECTIVES - Primary Objective : To evaluate efficacy osteopathic treatment adjunct standard medical treatment reduce child functional abdominal pain . - Secondary Objectives : To evaluate influence osteopathic treatment child adolescents functional abdominal pain related absenteeism , number emergency room visit , quality life need rescue medication . The potential adverse effect record . METHODS 1 . Design : Controlled clinical trial single-blind 2 . Site study conduct : Participants recruit follow pediatric service medical intervention carry : Hospital del Mar de Barcelona Hospital Sant Joan de Déu de Barcelona Participants experimental group ( standard medical treatment + osteopathic treatment ) refer d'Osteopathy Clinic Barcelona realization osteopathic treatment . 3 . Sample : A convenience sample include 30 patient per study group ( n = 60 ) recruit . As exploratory study investigator proceed make sample size calculation . 4 . Eligibility Criteria : Inclusion criterion : The sample consist patient school age ( 6-16 year old ) diagnose functional abdominal pain ( Functional Abdominal Pain-Related Disorders ) accord diagnostic criterion functional gastrointestinal disorder ROME guide III . Exclusion criterion : Patients diagnose digestive disease , patient receive medical aid patient study physical treatment . 5 . Randomization : This comparative study two quasi-experimental intervention ( standard treatment vs. standard treatment + Osteopathy ) . The allocation patient group hold ( obtain inform consent ) system randomization plus matching system . Patients meet eligibility criterion randomize receive one intervention first instance . This allocation study group mark induce pairing ( `` match '' ) new subject study meet characteristics previously randomize . To , random award , 3 specific characteristic subject record : 1. age ( 6 year 10 year 11 16 year ) 2. sex 3. type functional abdominal pain severity ( ROME III ) . When new patient characteristic previously patient randomize study group , assign paired form another study group without go randomization process . With design investigator intend balance study group give investigator small sample pragmatic inclusion . f ) Masking : This single-blind trial evaluator blind . The characteristic study intervention possible mask therapist patient . g ) Interventions : - Standard medical treatment : organic cause discard complementary examination , depend symptom patient . Subsequently , appropriate standard pharmacological treatment type functional abdominal pain apply : - Functional dyspepsia : proton-pump inhibitor omeprazole 1 mg / kg / day vo - Abdominal migraine -Treatment : sumatriptan 50 mg PO - Functional abdominal pain : antispasmodic - Irritable colon : methylcellulose + antispasmodic * There study define precise standard treatment functional abdominal pain - Osteopathic treatment ( BMT ) description collect item intervention guide report tidier . The TMO 100 % manual intervention apply individually direct contact therapist patient . For study 5 session set fortnightly interval session last 45 60 'each ( total 2 month treatment ) . Both first visit physical examination prior treatment consist hold : i. Quadrant abdominal palpation ii . Rating excursion tone respiratory pelvic diaphragm iii . Palpation mobility test spine ( especially high thoracic lumbar segment ) iv . Test listen skull base cranial sacral follow model William G. Sutherland . Scanning perform detect presence somatic dysfunction ( DS ) . The term DS part osteopathic terminology define `` alteration function component relate somatic system : skeletal structure , joint myofascial vascular element , neural lymphatic relate '' . The scan result determine treatment adapt particular case within framework follow technique : - See complete description technique Glossary Osteopathic Terminology , 2011 . 1 . Indirect Techniques work abdominal pelvic diaphragm Objective : To work influence pressure distribution ( especially abdominal ) body cavity consequently viscera contain therein , proper arterial supply venous drainage linfático . - Osteopathic model justify approach related reference . 2 . Functional Techniques visceral dysfunction Objective : visceral relaxation technique . Listen treatment visceral motility functional technique apply directly viscera support tissue - Osteopathic model justify approach related reference . 3 . Direct Techniques ( articulatory ) / indirect spine dysfunction 4 . Treatment cranial sacral approach dysfunction skull Objective : Work visceral autonomic innervation ( sympathetic parasympathetic ) different digestive organ order improve vascularization function . Who perform intervention ? : A unique osteopath ( DM ) carry intervention avoid far possible bias among different therapist . DM Physiotherapist Osteopath 10 year clinical experience adult pediatric patient . She specialize pediatric Osteopathy postgraduate training . Strategies ensure adherence treatment co-interventions telephone reminder schedule visit osteopathic treatment . Special care take avoid co-interventions . To participant baseline duly inform special paragraph inform consent h ) Outcomes : - Principal outcome : Pain Measured visual analog scale . A version appropriate pictograms pediatric patient use . Measurements take baseline ( baseline measurement ) 4 , 8 week ( duration intervention ) 6 month post-study - Secondary outcome : - Truancy : record truancy 6 month follow-up study - Number visit emergency : registry emergency room visit 6 month follow-up study - Quality life : Patients fill form Kidscreen quality life translation Spanish ( begin end study ) - Calendar symptom : Patients fill schedule symptom 6 month follow-up study follow variable : day onset pain , pain intensity , pain location , trigger , associate symptom need take rescue medication . - Adverse effect : record adverse effect might occur study</detailed_description>
