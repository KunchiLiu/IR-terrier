	<brief_summary>The investigator perform research study determine whether low iron-sulfur cluster level cause disease know pulmonary hypertension ( PH ) . PH define abnormally high blood pressure arteries lung . Usually , small specialize structure inside human cell call mitochondrion charge generate energy within lung artery normal function . During situation disease stress , lung artery undergo change teh function mitochondrion , result development PH . In study mouse , investigator learn alteration production specific metal complex call iron-sulfur cluster responsible change . This make likely mouse develop PH . In study , investigator want find alteration iron-sulfur cluster formation lead increase likelihood develop PH human .</brief_summary>

This blood isolate PBMCs generation iPSCs ( case skin biopsy work ) . In case , investigator 's lab take blood skin biopsy ship directly ice investigator 's collaborator Yale ( Yibing Qyang ) . - ECG , do research coordinator read PI/Sub-Investigator - 6 Minute Walk Test , do research coordinator - Skin Biopsy underarm inner thigh Dr. Laura Ferris . Patients escort research coordinator 3rd floor Falk Dermatology Clinic . All visit occur Outpatient Cardiology Presby 5B clinic except Skin Biopsy note . This visit last 6-7 hour . Study Visit Two - Right Heart Catheterization do Presby 's Cath Lab PI/Sub-Investigator . Duration ~ 3 hour - IF result show pressure lung vessel elevate without exercise AND abnormality heart function , investigator NOT need perform exercise test . In case patient rest echocardiography . ( determined PI/Sub-Investigator ) - In case , patient Exercise Right Heart Catheterization Rest Stress Echocardiography . ( Determined PI/Sub-Investigator - Resting Echocardiogram complete echocardiogram lab Presby train sonographer . Results give PI/Sub-Investigator . Duration ~ 30-45 minute - Exercise Echocardiogram complete Presby 's cath lab . If patient unable exercise medication ( Dobutamine ) give . Duration ~ 1-2 hour - Exercise Right Heart Catheterization complete Presby Cath Lab Dr. Ishizawar .
