	<brief_title>PreOperative Steroid Abdominal Wall Reconstruction : A Double-blinded Randomized Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preoperative high-dose glucocorticoid show attenuate postoperative inflammatory response lead decreased morbidity length stay ( LOS ) colorectal aortic surgery , well decrease pain subjective recovery orthopedic surgery . Methylprednisolone ( MP , `` Solu-Medrol '' ) one glucocorticoid , show safe usage surgery . Giant ventral hernia repair associate high risk postoperative morbidity prolong LOS compare hernia repair procedure require laparotomy . Further , total cost procedure remain high . Systemic administration high-dose preoperative MP ventral hernia repair describe anecdotally literature , never aim improve treatment patient group specifically . It however unknown extent benefit weigh downside usage high-dose MP giant ventral hernia repair , patient often increase risk postoperative wound infection . On background hypothesize preoperative high-dose MP result improve recovery giant ventral hernia repair compare placebo .</detailed_description>
