	<detailed_description>JDM chronic systemic autoimmune disease predominance muscle skin inflammation unknown etiology vary prognosis . Children JDM unresponsive corticosteroid immunosuppressive medication face poor clinical functional outcome suffer various sequelae disease . Abatacept fully human soluble recombinant protein consist cytotoxic T cell Lymphocyte Antigen-4 ( CTLA4 ) fuse Fc region human IgG1 modify prevent complement fixation antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity . Abatacept bind specifically CD80 ( B7-1 ) CD86 ( B7-2 ) molecule , express antigen-presenting cell ( APCs ) . Upon engagement CTLA4 CD80 CD86 , resultant inhibition signal transduction inhibits T cell activation.. The rationale use Abatacept therapy JDM include expression CTLA4 , CD28 , CD86 , CD40 inflammatory cell muscle biopsy patient DM , well CTLA4 CD28 muscle cell . A patient 's participation study last approximately 24 week possible extension 48 week . At screen , participant physical exam , muscle strength assessment , blood urine collection , chest x-ray ; also ask complete several questionnaire . All participant receive week subcutaneous injection Abatacept . Each injection give outpatient basis . There total 6 study visit . All participant visit outpatient clinic select time point muscle strength testing , physical exam , disease activity measurement , blood urine collection , muscle MRI ; also ask complete several questionnaire . During study , participant monitor closely improvement worsen disease serious drug relate side effect . Eligibility Ages Eligible Study : ≥ 8 year old Genders Eligible Study : Both Race/Ethnic Backgrounds Eligibility Study : No restriction</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Adults definite probable JDM pediatric patient eight year age old definite probable JDM 2 . Body weight least 30 kg ( least 66 lb ) age ≥ 7 year age . 3 . Patients must reside within United States . 4 . Refractory myositis , define intolerance inadequate response corticosteroid plus adequate regimen least one immunosuppressive agent , include azathioprine , methotrexate , IVIG , mycophenolate mofetil , cyclophosphamide , tacrolimus cyclosporine A , biologic therapy . The definition intolerance : side effect require discontinuation medication underlie condition precludes use medication . 5 . At least moderately active disease document : MD global VAS minimum value 2.5 cm 10 cm scale AND At least 2 abnormal core set measure list : Core Set Measures : An MMT8 score great 125/150 Patient/Parent Global VAS minimum value 2.0 cm 10cm scale CHAQ/HAQ disability index minimum value 0.25 Elevation least one muscle enzymes [ include creatine kinase ( CK ) , aldolase , lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ] minimum level 1.3 x upper limit normal . Global extramuscular disease activity score minimum value 2.0 cm 10 cm VAS scale 6 . Therapy prednisone another glucocorticoid require , unless document intolerance medical record medical condition contraindicates use prednisone . The prednisone dose must stable least 4 week prior screen visit ( recommend dose ≤ 1.0 mg/kg/day ) . Background therapy least 1 noncorticosteroid immunosuppressive agent require stable dose least 6 week prior screen visit unless documentation patient intolerant , define side effect require discontinuation medication ( ) underlie condition precludes use IS medication . 7 . If immunosuppressive agent discontinue prior screen visit must : 4 week washout prednisone methotrexate 8 week washout IS agent For discontinuation biologic therapy , washout 5 terminal half live 8 . If hydroxychloroquine colchicine , dose stable 6 week prior Visit 1 . 9 . If statin fibric acid derivative agent , dose stable 6 week prior Visit 1 . 10 . Ability patient parent complete selfreport questionnaire . 11 . Men woman reproductive potential must agree use reliable method birth control 24 week duration trial describe reproductive risk section protocol ( section 4.3 ) . They must also agree use reliable method birth control 100 day last dose study drug administer . 12 . Patients must agree forgo immunization live vaccine course study within 3 month discontinuation . 13 . Patients must letter refer rheumatologist specialist supervise care JDM , agree patient 's participation study continue provide care patient , include emergency care trial . 1 . Druginduced myositis ( myositis patient take medication know induce myositislike syndrome , include , limited , statin agent , fibric acid derivative , colchicine ) . 2 . Juvenile polymyositis ; inclusion body myositis ; cancerassociated myositis , define diagnosis myositis within 2 year diagnosis cancer except basal squamous cell skin cancer carcinoma situ cervix least 5 year since excision 3 . Myositis overlap another connective tissue disease ( CTD ) preclude accurate assessment treatment response ( example , difficulty assess muscle strength scleroderma patient associate myositis ) 4 . History receive live vaccine 4 week prior initiation study treatment 5 . Joint disease , severe calcinosis , musculoskeletal condition , preclude ability quantitate muscle strength . 6 . Wheelchair bound patient . 7 . Known hypersensitivity abatacept prior receipt abatacept 8 . Concomitant illness would prevent adequate patient assessment investigator opinion pose add risk study participant : Recurrent chronic infection , include HIV , tuberculosis , hepatitis B C , TB infection , include contact household contact active tuberculosis ( TB ) receive appropriate document prophylaxis TB . ( documented negative Hepatitis B surface antigen Hepatitis C antibody complete screen visit within 6 week prior screen visit require ) Have symptomatic herpes zoster herpes simplex infection within 12 week prior entry screen period Have history disseminated/complicated herpes zoster ( example , multidermatomal involvement , ophthalmic zoster , central nervous system ( CNS ) involvement , postherpetic neuralgia ) Known liver disease ( i.e . cirrhosis condition compromise synthetic function liver ) Disorders would preclude accurate assessment neuromuscular function Cardiomyopathy arrhythmia investigator opinion pose additional risk study participant New York Heart Association Classification III IV congestive heart failure Psychiatric illness precludes compliance neuromuscular assessment Serum creatinine &gt; 2.0mg/dl 9 . Pregnant female nurse mother 10 . Life threaten illness would interfere patient 's ability complete study . 11 . Known suspected history drug alcohol abuse within past 6 month determine medical record patient interview 12 . Anticipated poor compliance 13 . Participation another clinical experimental therapeutic study within 30 day screen visit . 14 . Any history evidence severe illness condition would make patient , opinion investigator unsuitable study . 15 . Low total WBC &lt; 2.000 , platelet &lt; 100,000/mm3 ; hemoglobin &lt; 10 gm/dl 16 . History recurrent infection include active skin infection calcinosis 17 . Subjects history cancer last 5 year 18 . Subjects time receive treatment investigational drug within 28 day ( less 5 terminal halflives elimination ) day 1 dose study drug , include wait CD19 return detectable level patient receive rituximab . 19 . Concomitant treatment antiTNF therapy , rituximab anakinra biologic therapy . 20 . Initiation colchicine hydroxychloroquine new drug study participation allow . 21 . Initiation statins fibric acid derivative study participation allow . 22 . Initiation exercise program within 4 week screen visit . Only stretch program may initiate study ( See section 5.4 Other Restrictions )</criteria>
