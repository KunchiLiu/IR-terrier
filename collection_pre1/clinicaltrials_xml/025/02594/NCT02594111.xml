	<brief_summary>Inflammation artery heart may increase risk cardiac death . The propose research seek identify potential beneficial role safe anti-inflammatory medication , colchicine , reduce damage cause opening blockage artery heart . With quick onset action excellent safety profile , colchicine may potential reduce risk major adverse event related heart . This research also seek well understand role neutrophil , common type inflammatory white blood cell body , damage heart .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator use colchicine tool elucidate role neutrophil activation acute vascular injury , explore association neutrophil activation adverse cardiovascular outcome . Colchicine reduce cell surface expression selection , adhesion molecule key neutrophil recruitment vascular injury . Daily colchicine use associate reduced adverse cardiovascular event stable atherosclerosis . Using clinical percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) model , investigator evaluate whether pre-procedural colchicine ( 1.8 mg oral load one hour ) reduce rate post-PCI adverse cardiovascular outcome context double-blind placebo-controlled randomize study . The investigator also characterize neutrophil biology acute vascular injury effect colchicine neutrophil biology set . This study extend investigation study NCT01709981 ClinicalTrials.gov , remain double-blinded . However , main focus study NCT01709981 evaluate marker inflammation , current study 's main focus evaluate peri-procedural myocardial infarction . Although recruitment current study begin 12/2015 , investigator increase power use data already collect initial substudy NCT01709981 .</detailed_description>
