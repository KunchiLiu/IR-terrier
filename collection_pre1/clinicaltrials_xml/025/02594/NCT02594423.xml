	<brief_summary>The cornea transparent window eye , allow light enter eye also contribute focus light ray . One major factor responsible transparency lack blood vessel . However , follow inflammation new blood vessel ( corneal vascularisation [ CVas ] ) grow cornea affect transparency impair vision . CVas lead damage form scarring , oedema , fat deposition major cause corneal graft rejection . In 2000 ethical approval ( OY129801 ) investigator develop publish clinical technique call Fine Needle Diathermy occlusion corneal vessel ( FND ) . This proven successful occlude establish vessel practice many center across world . Recently demonstrate inhibiting chemical stimulant vessel formation call vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) active new vessel growth retina suppress . The approach also use corneal new vessel . Bevacizumab ( Avastin ) chemical inhibitor VEGF use extensively treat retinal new vessel macular degeneration . Avastin show effective safe treat corneal new vessel . The investigator propose evaluate efficacy safety FND alone FND combine Avastin treatment CVas .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Corneal neovascularisation common problem affect sex age induce differ underlying cause . It consider single important risk factor graft rejection . The process angiogenesis , i.e . formation new blood vessel , similar part body . Hence principle adopt alleviate new blood vessel one area apply blood vessel area use similar drug . Over past 8 year component necessary angiogenesis , i.e Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) target induce regression blood vessel patient cancer intravenous dosage anti-VEGF . More recently , anti-VEGF therapy target eye related neovascularisation , especially treatment age relate macular degeneration . This role expand include structure eye affect angiogenesis neovascular glaucoma ( Iris ) diabetic retinopathy ( Retina ) . Over past year attention drawn use antiVEGF therapy surface eye . Many report international peer review literature comment use anti VEGF therapy form drop injection surface eye , subconjunctivally within cornea . They find drop injection safe , although injection appear act favourably . Avastin investigate treat corneal new vessel prove safe effective . Fine needle diathermy ( FND ) routine method occlude corneal vessel develop department 2000 use worldwide . It establish technique suitable active mature vessel . However , consequent transient tissue injury inflammation trigger new vessel formation . Avastin effective occlusion active vessel only.It affect establish mature vessel . Hence FND combine Avastin expect hypothesized efficient last occlusion vessel obtain . In study , investigator aim investigate combine action Avastin fine needle diathermy occlusion corneal vessel . The actual incidence corneal neovascularisation UK unknown American study suggest 1.4 million people affected sight threaten complication annual basis . These blood vessel arise multitude cause , include viral infection , corneal injury , chronic inflammation result corneal transplantation . Conventional therapy present time include surgical occlusion blood vessel diathermy laser chronic use steroid . The latter option associate potential sight threaten complication glaucoma . This study generate data inform control study towards establish Avastin fine needle diathermy treatment choice corneal new vessel .</detailed_description>
