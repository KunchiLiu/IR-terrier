	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Allogeneic Mesenchymal Stem Cells Patients With Rapidly Progressive Interstitial Lung Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite significant progress treatment interstitial lung disease , achieve thanks new drug , pirfenidone nintedanib , many patient drug available poorly tolerate . In addition significant evidence effectiveness safety valid idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis . The transplantation allogeneic stem cell promising direction modern medicine prove safety different disease . But effectiveness therapy still research . We believe severe case rapidly progressive interstitial lung disease transplantation mesenchymal stem cell may effective technology due immunomodulatory property .</detailed_description>
