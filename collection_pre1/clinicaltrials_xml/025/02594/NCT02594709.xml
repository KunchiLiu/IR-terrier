	<brief_title>Multisession Radiosurgery Optic Nerve Sheath Meningiomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction Optic Nerve Sheath Meningiomas ( ONSMs ) rare tumour . They represent approximately 2 % orbital tumour , 1-2 % intracranial meningioma one third optic nerve lesion ( 23 , 32 , 42 , 43 ) . Usually tumour monolateral 5 % bilateral development ( 33 ) On base growth pattern tumour classify primary secondary form . The former type arise arachnoid cap cell fibrous dural capsule optic nerve usually growth circumferentially along nerve . Primary ONSMs subdivide orbital intracanalicular form . Secondary ONSMs usually arise sphenoid ridge tuberculum sellae subsequently spread optic canal orbit ( 14 , 42 ) . Often pathological study show meningotheliomatous transitional histology . Middle age woman often affect ( 4 , 36 , 44 ) . The frequent presentation symptom visual loss , acuity visual field . This nearly expression optic nerve direct compression vascular rearrangement . Optic nerve atrophy common . Optociliary shunt late rare sign direct expression compressive optic neuropathy pathognomonic diagnosis ONSM ( 35 , 43 ) . Traditionally treatment option include observation , surgery radiotherapy , , assume treatment choice . Nevertheless , development new technology improve interest radiotherapy application . Conservative treatment consider due benign nature meningioma slow growth pattern . Nevertheless unavoidably lead visual deterioration complete blindness ( 18 , 33 , 43 , 44 ) . Surgery advocate tumour administration , particularly case progressive visual loss complete blindness , tumour progression intracranial involvement . Anyway intimate relationship optic nerve , ophthalmic artery central retina artery ONSMs complete removal extremely challenge . Moreover post-operative course often characterize symptom worsen ( 4 , 8 , 9 , 15 ) . In recent past , role radiotherapy remain uncertain : many author report positive experience , concern complication secondary effect strongly limit acceptance ( 4 , 5 , 16 , 21 , 22 , 26 , 29 , 31 , 32 ) . Radiation optic neuropathy describe follow conventional radiotherapy treatment ( 45 Gy , 2 Gy per fraction ) ( 40 ) . More recently two large series patient treat fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy confirm positive experience tumour control greatly reduce concern treatment relate toxicity ( 6 , 27 ) . Under light successful meningioma treatment , radiosurgery propose treatment option . Single session , high conformality , frame base radiosurgery system seldom ever propose ONSMs treatment due know dose tolerance optic nerve ( 22 ) . The development radiosurgery technology , start 1994 , introduce new effective therapeutic option ( 3 , 11 , 12 ) . In way possible exploit different recovery speed normal pathological tissue optimize tumour control time spare surround structure avoid damage visual pathway . In fact , comparison various fractionation regimen result roughly equivalent biologically equivalent dose ( BED ) tumour control normal tissue late effect ( assume tumour normal tissue late effect similar α/β ratio ) . In way acute ( early ) reaction would reduce large fraction size ( 19 ) . The first experience ONSMs treatment multisession radiosurgery treatment quite promising ( 32 ) . The aim present study prospectively evaluate efficacy safety multisession radiosurgery ONSMs treatment . The treatment evaluate term tumour growth control spar vision . PATIENTS AND METHODS Patient 's population . XX patient affect Optic Nerve Sheath Meningioma ( ONSM ) , orbital intra-canalicular consider multisession radiosurgery . Eligibility : Inclusions criteria significant visual impairment presentation , progression visual dysfunction observation period , disease progression . Due histological diagnosis imply invasive hazardous procedure , biopsy perform diagnosis exclusively radiological . Pre-treatment evaluation . All patient , treatment , collectively evaluate Neurosurgeon , Radiation Oncologist Neuro-Ophthalmologist . Clinical investigation include full neurological examination . Particularly I , III , IV , V VI pair cranial nerve investigate . Visual acuity , visual field also investigate Neuro-ophthalmologist . Visual acuity investigate use best correct Snellen visual acuity . A standardized automated perimetry humphrey Visual 30-2 field test perform order define presence visual field deficit Dose selection radiobiology consideration . The dose selection base previous experience Radiosurgery Stereotactical Radiotherapy ( 1 , 2 , 23 , 28 , 30 ) , also previous study concern dose tolerance anterior visual pathway ( 38 ) . Assumed consideration plan multisession radiosurgery : patient treat maximum dose 25 Gy ( 5 Gy/fraction ; 5 fraction ) . The total dose plan study comparable dos deliver conventional fractionate regimen ( 50,4 - 56 Gy ) . In fact , assume meningioma 's α/β ratio approximately 3,7-3,8 Gy ( 34 , 41 ) . According equivalent dose formula : EQD2 = D * [ ( + α/β ) / ( 2 + α/β ) = 38,2 Gy D alter schedule total dose , alter daily dose . Then , consider difference overall treatment time conventional fractionate hypofractionated treatment ( 28 fraction , 5 fraction per week , 38 total day 5 fraction , 5 day respectively ) , assume Dprolif = 0,7 tumour ( 7 , 17 ) , Dprolif dose recover daily own proliferation : EQD2 , T = EQD2 , - [ ( T - ) * Dprolif ] = 61 Gy Treatment planning . Patients 1.25 mm thickness MRI , include fat suppression sequence , T1with Gadolinium sequence contrast-enhanced CT scan . The image merge order optimize definition target volume intra-extraorbital segment optic nerve , organ risk ( i.e . retina ) An inverse planning software adopt optimize target coverage time achieve maximum conformality homogeneity prescription dose . The treatment plan use treatment base analysis volumetric dose include dose-volume histogram ( DVH ) analyse PTV critical normal structure . The number paths beam use patient vary determine select individual treatment plan . Target Volumes The target volume consist tumor outline treatment planning software see plan CT and/or MRI . The planning target volume ( PTV ) plan encompass 75-85 % isodose line . All organ risk define . Follow-up . Following multisession radiosurgery , patient evaluate tumour progression visual function multidisciplinary team ( Radiation Oncologist , Neurosurgeon ; Neuro-Ophthalmologist ) . The patient evaluate 3 month treatment , every 6 month first two year per year . Every follow-up include Neurological , Radiological neuro-ophthalmological evaluation . Neuro-Ophthalmologic assessment include comprehensive evaluation visual acuity , visual field , extrinsic eye movement , proptosis . Visual acuity investigate use test base line . Post-treatment radiographic evaluation include MRI scan every 6 month . Primary end point Primary end point local growth control maintenance improvement visual acuity base line Response criteria The partial response define tumour reduction 20 % . Progression disease define increase tumour dimension . Toxicity Ocular toxicity describe reference CTCAE 3 version criterion . DATA COLLECTION Patients allocate number data collect Case Report Forms . Data include information protocol visit complete timely manner . STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS Analysis conduct check tumor control correlate clinical symptom improvement use short course radiotherapy treatment relation previous describe radiobiological consideration . Clinical improvement measure specific ophthalmological test .</detailed_description>
