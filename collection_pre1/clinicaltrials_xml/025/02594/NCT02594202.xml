	<brief_summary>Background : Prostate cancer common noncutaneous cancer among men U.S . Researchers want study blood , tissue , fluid sample people prostate cancer . This help understand change cell gene . These change might lead development progression prostate cancer . Researchers think study could lead new treatment . Objective : To understand change cell gene lead development progression prostate cancer . This could lead new treatment . Eligibility : Men age 18 older suspect prostate cancer Design : Participants screen physical exam medical history . Participants send tissue block tumor , possible . If , provide unstained slide tumor tissue . Participants may provide sample blood , urine , saliva , prostate secretion . Participants may image test . They lie machine take picture body . These test include : MRI prostate CT abdomen pelvis Chest x-ray Participants may need biopsy surgery treatment cancer . If , researcher collect tissue . Participants may answer question prostate cancer quality life . Participants may follow-up visit treatment . They may follow-up phone call every month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - Prostate carcinoma second common malignancy diagnose men . Approximately 1 6 men diagnose prostate cancer lifetime . - Understanding molecular mechanism genomic alteration cause prostate carcinoma provide foundation development novel target therapeutic agent disease . Since 1982 investigator Urologic Oncology Branch study genetic basis urologic cancer . The identification gene cancer kidney lead approval FDA number new agent patient advanced disease . Similarly , goal study cancer biology ( genomic , molecular , cellular biology ) prostate carcinoma order develop novel treatment strategy . - Collection patient tumor sample allow u study molecular biologic pathway develop novel target therapy . Correlation sample radiographical finding clinical outcome patient allow u predict understand clinical outcome possibly develop predictive and/or prognostic biomarkers . Objectives : Primary : Collect blood , urine , saliva , express prostatic secretion , benign malignant tissue patient know suspected prostate cancer purpose elucidate molecular mechanism carcinogenesis prostate cancer ultimately , identify novel therapeutic target . Eligibility : - Adults biopsy-proven suspected prostate cancer require diagnostic therapeutic intervention part diagnosis , standard care treatment , followup/ surveillance neoplasm . Design : - Tissue acquisition protocol normal malignant prostate cancer tissue may obtain time clinically indicate diagnostic and/or therapeutic intervention . - Blood urine sample research obtain baseline follow-up interval . Expressed prostatic secretion may collect baseline follow-up interval . Additionally , saliva may collect baseline . - No investigational experimental therapy give part protocol .</detailed_description>
