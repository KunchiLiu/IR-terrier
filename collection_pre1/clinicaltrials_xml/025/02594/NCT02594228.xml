	<detailed_description>The primary purpose study examine effect increase healthy protein intake ( 25 % daily caloric intake protein ; 25 % healthy fat oil ; 50 % complex , unrefined carbohydrate ) consume 6 small meal day combination exercise training 4 time per week , 16 week period 25 overweight , healthy male female ( 30-60 yr old ) . A secondary purpose compare effect consume two 6 small meal day comprise whole food protein source serving 20g/serving ) match group consume whey protein 2 daily protein serving ( 20g/serving ) . In case group , 1 serving consume immediately follow exercise [ within 30 minute ] 1 serve consume 2 hour go bed . On non-exercise day , participant continue consume 6 small meal per day ratio 25 % lean protein , 25 % healthy fat oil , 50 % complex , unrefined carbohydrate group differ composition last meal day consume 2 hour go bed one group consume protein ( 20g/serving ) whole food protein source group consume single serve whey protein supplement . The primary purpose study quantify change follow health outcome baseline 16 week : total body muscle mass fat mass ( iDXA ) ; abdominal fat mass ( highly relate cardiovascular metabolic disease risk ) ; blood sugar ( glucose ) ; blood lipid ; insulin , aerobic fitness ( assess submaximal exercise test ) ; muscular strength ( measure 1 repetition maximum ( RM ) chest leg press ) . The following additional measure assess baseline 16 week : waist circumference ; body weight , heart rate , blood pressure , hunger ( Visual Analog Scales ) .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Each participant screen prior participate study use Health Fitness History , Physical Activity , Physical Activity Readiness questionnaire administer investigator . Medical clearance secure participant 's primary care physician verify cardiovascular , metabolic orthopedic issue would prohibit perform exercise duration study period Depending outcome health history , fitness activity questionnaires physician 's clearance , participant inform eligibility participate study . A group meeting schedule eligible interested participant review entire study . This process take place prior administering test . Participants exclude smoke , whey protein intolerance , orthopedic condition prohibit engage strenuous exercise</criteria>
