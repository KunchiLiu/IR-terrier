	<detailed_description>The use nasogastric ( NG ) decompression pancreaticoduodenectomy ( PD ) current practice . NG tube associate high rate morbidity include pulmonary morbidity , delay gastric empty finally increase length hospital stay . In era enhance recovery major abdominal surgery , place NG tube remain unproven PD even NG tube clearly abandon liver , stomach colonic surgery . Nowadays , retrospective series report feasibility absence nasogastric tube PD , randomize control trial . The absence NG decompression could corner stone concept enhanced recovery program PD . The objective prospective randomize monocentric study evaluate impact absence NG decompression PD . The aim study decrease postoperative morbidity PD include pulmonary delay gastric empty complication . The impact absence systematic NG decompression could interest term public health decrease length hospital stay . Furthermore , first randomize study compare NG tube decompression PD absence NG tube PD would bring relevant element improve recovery PD .</detailed_description>
