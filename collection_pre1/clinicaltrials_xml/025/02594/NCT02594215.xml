	<brief_summary>Background : Proteus syndrome ( PS ) cause mutation AKT1 gene . This gene make protein communicates protein body make cell grow . The AKT1 mutation change chemical signal body cause overgrowth . PS fatal . The drug ARQ 092 reduces signal AKT1 protein . This may reduce stabilize overgrowth people PS . Researchers want find best dose ARQ 092 base effect tissue people PS . Objective : To determine safety , tolerability , recommend dose ARQ 092 people PS . Eligibility : People age 12 old PS Design : Participants screen medical history , physical exam , blood urine test . Participants take ARQ 092 mouth daily 12 28-day cycle . Participants must stay near NIH Clinical Center ( CC ) whole first cycle , weekly visit CC . For cycle 2 , visit every 2 week . They 1 visit cycle 3 4 , every cycle cycle 5 11 . The final visit end cycle 12 . Visits may include : Small skin sample take . ECG : Soft electrode skin record heart signal . Echocardiogram : A small probe hold chest take picture heart . MRI : Participants lie machine take picture body . Joint mobility function test . Participants complete survey phone person . Participants keep daily medication symptom diary .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dose Finding Trial ARQ 092 Children Adults With Proteus Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Proteus syndrome rare segmental overgrowth disorder cause somatic gain function mutation oncogene AKT1 , encode AKT1 kinase . The disorder progressive , high morbidity mortality living adult disease . Tissues cell line patient Proteus syndrome harbor admixture mutant allele range &lt; 1 % approximately 50 % . This mutation cause constitutive activation AKT1 , Ser473 Thr308 phosphorylation . This activation stimulate AKT/PI3K pathway , mediate process include increase cell proliferation decrease apoptosis . The progressive nature disorder mechanism disease ( gain function ) make AKT1 excellent target therapeutic , specifically repression . The AKT/PI3K pathway mutate numerous cancer well . Because commonly mutated cancer , pharmaceutical company interested target molecule inhibitor . Indeed , Proteus syndrome consider simple model cancer therapeutic , patient know harbor single activate mutation instead hundred thousand mutate cancer . ArQule Inc. develop small molecule , ARQ 092 effectively inhibits AKT , low IC ( 50 ) AKT1 ( compare AKT2 AKT3 , order magnitude low kinase ) . This agent undergone significant development animal toxicity study currently phase I trials patient different type cancer . In addition , perform vitro test ARQ 092 cell patient Proteus syndrome demonstrate reduction AKT1 phosphorylation dose range achievable blood level human low toxicity . Because Proteus syndrome chronic disease , typical approach define recommend phase II dose determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) appropriate unreasonable propose patient would tolerate significant side effect prolong time period . As initial trial disease , propose phase I study determine recommend dose subsequent trial , determine efficacy ARQ 092 Proteus syndrome . The recommended phase II dose determine base tolerability ARQ 092 adolescent adults Proteus syndrome measure drug level plasma affected tissue patient Proteus syndrome measure tissue phosphorylation AKT1 . We hypothesize recommend dose ARQ 092 substantially dos use patient cancer lead highly favorable risk benefit ratio base future efficacy study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Meets publish clinical criterion PS . Measurable disease : Patients must least one measurable lesion volumetric MRI photographic CCTN . Has CLIAvalidated report demonstrate presence mosaic AKT1 c.49G &gt; A mutation . 12 year age old . The age limit include adolescent choose childhood puberty consider great risk disease progression , ARQ 092 may provide benefit young group patient . In addition , important objective study characterize pharmacokinetics ARQ 092 pediatric population since good study adult . Not use use within past 6 month medication know affect AKT/PI3K pathway ( e.g. , everolimus ) , review NIHCC pharmacist . Performance status : Patients great equal 16 year age must Karnofsky performance level great equal 40 % , adolescents 12 16 year old must Lansky performance great equal 40 % . Is willing identify allow u communicate outside medical provider need . Hepatic function : Bilirubin must less equal 1.5 x upper limit normal SGPT ( ALT ) must less equal 2.5 x upper limit normal . Cardiac function : Must ejection fraction normal limit age echocardiogram . Must cognitive ability complete patient surveys/QOL assessment appropriate age appropriate surrogate decisionmaker guardian able complete measure case intellectually impaired adult . Renal function : Ageadjusted normal serum creatinine ( see Table ) OR creatinine clearance great equal 60 mL/min/1.73 m^2 . Age ( Years ) : less equal 15 ; Serum Creatinine ( mg/dl ) : less equal to1.2 Age ( Years ) : &gt; 15 ; Serum Creatinine ( mg/dl ) : less equal 1.5 Body surface area least 1.11 m^2 EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Pregnant breastfeeding female exclude due potential risk fetal teratogenic adverse event investigational agent . Pregnancy test must obtain prior enrollment study female . Males female reproductive potential may participate unless agree use effective contraceptive method . Abstinence acceptable method birth control . Patients anticipate need surgical intervention within first three cycle ( 3 month ) , surgical intervention period DLT evaluation may affect analysis adherence and/or make subject unevaluable . An investigational agent within past 6 month . Ongoing radiation therapy , chemotherapy , hormonal therapy direct disease , immunotherapy , biologic therapy . Clinically significant unrelated systemic illness , serious infection , hepatic , renal organ dysfunction , judgment Principal Associate Investigator would compromise patient ability tolerate agent use trial likely interfere study procedure result . Type I II diabetes mellitus treat insulin oral hypoglycemic agent . Abnormal LVEF echocardiogram . Patients know extensive intestinal involvement disease evidence malabsorption , investigator opinion could compromise drug absorption . Patients opinion investigator may able comply safety monitoring requirement study . Inability undergo MRI and/or contraindication MRI examination follow MRI protocol . Prosthesis orthopedic dental brace would interfere volumetric analysis target lesion MRI . Evidence tumor , cancer require treatment chemotherapy radiation therapy . Patients baseline ( pretreatment ) QTcF &gt; 470ms ECG . Absence approve legal guardian approve surrogate decisionmaker case intellectually impaired adult .</criteria>
