	<brief_summary>Nowadays , ECC exercise realize use various modality target small large muscle mass segmentary dynamic way . The training program propose study realise handmade ergocycle allow eccentric contraction . With type ergometer , O2 consumption ( VO2 ) three five fold low exercise realise power output concentric ergocycle . Due later propertie , origins yet fully identify , increase interest embed ECC rehabilitation program . The investigator hypothesis high pedal rate induce low oxygen consumption , benefit . This study aim compare oxygen consumption two pedal rate : 50 80 rotation per minute ( rpm ) . The ultimate goal ass efficacy tolerance eccentric training ergocycle enhance comprehension physiological mecanisms involve low O2 consumption observe .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The training program propose study realise handmade ergocycle allow almost pur eccentric contraction . Fifteen healthy volunteer realize incremental test exertion concentric ergometer . If minimal power output 200W reach , volunteer familiarize eccentric exercise several bout exercise . This habituation session allow avoid secondary muscular effect high intensity eccentric exercise . Then , volunteer could take part two-stepped eccentric protocol : 1 ) incremental test consist 3 stage . Each stage last 4 minute . 2 ) A constant-load test realize 320W 6 minute . Each test realize twice : 50 80 rpm sequence randomly assign . [ One step ( incremental constant load ) = two test ( 50 80 rpm ) ] During step , oxygen consumption continuously measure , well cardiac output muscular activity intramuscular oxygen kinetic .</detailed_description>
