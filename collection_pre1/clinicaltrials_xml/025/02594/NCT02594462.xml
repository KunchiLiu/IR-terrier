	<brief_summary>Sickle cell anemia homozygous genetic disease high prevalence Brazil . There change conformation physicochemical property red cell generate varied clinical manifestation among chronic hemolytic anemia , cardiovascular disease , fever , splenic sequestration usually painful crisis . Women sickle cell anemia high maternal-fetal neonatal morbidity mortality . During pregnancy , intensification maternal anemia , episodes painful crisis ; also , obstetric risk , pre-eclampsia , thromboembolism hemorrhage . Thus , need adequate reproductive family plan population conduct mainly hormonal contraception . The World Health Organization recommend contraceptive method may prescribe people sickle cell anemia woman , progestogen-only contraceptive method indicate due change venous arterial thrombosis . Nevertheless , need scientific evidence best contraceptive choice among woman sickle cell anemia relation safety , adhesion reduction pain crisis . The objective study evaluate clinical effect safety etonogestrel-releasing contraceptive implant woman sickle cell anemia twelve month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There 3,500 child born year sickle cell disease Brazil . Almost three percent Bahia population sickle cell anemia , prevalent Brazil ( BRAGA , 2007 ) . Despite high prevalence sickle cell disease population , best option Contraceptive woman still uncertain , base low-quality study ( Haddad et al. , 2012 ) . Since condition associate numerous complication painful crisis , splenic sequestration , marrow aplasia , among others , lead frequent hospitalization high absenteeism rate . Women sickle cell disease reproductive age expose non-planning pregnancy , cause high risk maternal mortality ( 33 % ) , increase picture painful crisis , important maternal newborn complication abortion , childbirth premature , thrombosis , among others ( Andemariam , Browning , 2013 ) . Therefore , need provide appropriate method effective reproductive planning . Hormonal contraceptives progestogen , release implant etonogestrel ( ENG ) , represent option reduce unwanted pregnancy , especially patient risk venous thrombosis , patient anemia sickle , doensÂ´t interfere coagulation system ( Conrad et al. , 2004 ; Liedaagard etal. , 2011 ) . Thus , addition avoid unwanted pregnancy , method impact reduction maternal fetal morbidity mortality neonatal know associated pregnancy woman sickle cell anemia ( Santos et al. , 2005 ) . The scientific literature limit scarce association use method contraceptive woman sickle cell disease correlation clinical complication seizures painful anemia ( Haddad et al. , 2012 ) . The contraceptive implant etonogestrel reversibly progestogen-only contraceptive method , long lasting , highly effective , high continuation rate . However , still study woman sickle cell anemia use thereof . As progestogen-only method , increase risk thrombosis may , depot medroxyprogesterone acetate ( Abood et al. , 1997 ) , reduce painful crisis , advantage high efficacy long duration . In context , increase adherence whether clinical benefit use implant contraceptive release ENG , contraceptive method effectively isolate progestogen available Brazil , relation painful crisis anemia among woman sickle cell disease , make fundamental importance development study city high prevalence Brazil .</detailed_description>
