	<brief_summary>Two radiation therapy technique commonly use treatment intermediate high risk prostate cancer : brachytherapy external beam radiation therapy ( EBRT ) . However , limitation . Brachytherapy , radioactive seed insert prostate , produce excellent outcome invasive patient eligible willing receive treatment . EBRT , gentle time delivery , tend prolonged may poorer outcome brachytherapy . This study examine use stereotactic ablative radiotherapy ( SABR ) , patient give , high dose radiation treatment . Treatments short , non-invasive , applicable patient able brachytherapy , may effective conventional EBRT . This study compare SABR EBRT term rate acute late toxicity treatment , disease-free survival , health-related quality life measure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Androgen Suppression With Stereotactic Body External Beam Radiation Therapy ( ASSERT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current study randomize phase II study compare high speed , single arc , LINAC-based prostate stereotactic ablative radiotherapy ( SABR ) conventional external beam radiation treatment ( EBRT ) , along androgen suppression ( AS ) , men intermediate high risk prostate cancer , either unsuitable unwilling brachytherapy . The two primary objective study assess feasibility randomization , compare rate acute late toxicity . Should randomization prove feasible , toxicity comparable , future phase 3 trial pursue . Primary objective : 1 . To determine proportion eligible patient willing randomized 2 . To estimate compare proportion acute late toxicity , focus grade 3 4 complication treatment intervention deliver British Columbia ( BC ) Cancer Agency Secondary objective : 1 . To compare disease free survival reflect biochemical relapse free survival five year two intervention 2 . To compare health relate quality life reflect change EPIC questionnaire two intervention 3 . To quantify degree intra-fraction motion propose SABR technique Research Method To determine willingness eligible patient randomize , screen log document number eligible subject approach participation maintain . Subjects approach decline participation undergo short interview Clinical Research Associate reason non-participation . The Clinical Research Associate read script statement make sure subject refuse trial know free provide provide reason decline trial answer affect care receive . They ask list five reason non-participation trial . At conclusion trial , qualitative analysis do reason non-participation . The two radiation treatment protocol , conventional EBRT SABR , compare randomize , phase II study . Patients biopsy-proven intermediate high risk prostate cancer accrue . T3 T4 disease , men International Prostate Symptom Score &gt; 20 prostate volume &gt; 90 cc eligible . Men high risk disease must &lt; 15 % risk pelvic lymph node involvement eligible . Eligible subject identify treat oncologist enrol clinical trial unit participate regional cancer centre . Once consent form sign , Study Entry Form send trial administrative centre locate Vancouver Island Centre BC Cancer Agency . A Patient Identification Number assign patient randomize treatment arm . This study propose eighty ( 80 ) patient randomize 1:1 ratio . Subjects randomize Arm 1 ( conventional EBRT ) receive 73.68 Gy 28 fraction ( 5 treatment day per week 5.5 week ) . Subjects randomize Arm 2 ( SABR ) receive prescribe dose 36.25 Gy 5 fraction 5 week ( one treatment day per week ) . Subjects randomize SABR arm undergo additional procedure prior radiation treatment place gold seed fiducials ( placement gold seed fiducials optional EBRT arm discretion treat centre ) . Androgen-Deprivation Therapy ( ADT ) administer patient treatment arm . ADT consist luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone ( LHRH ) agonist monotherapy , total androgen blockade also permit discretion treat oncologist . The total duration ADT 6 month men intermediate risk disease , 18 month high risk disease . ADT initiate prior start RT . PATIENT ASSESSMENTS AND FOLLOWUP Pre-radiotherapy assessment : All patient must biopsy indicate prostate adenocarcinoma within 365 day trial registration . A full history physical examination , digital rectal examination , must do within 60 day registration . CT scan abdomen pelvis nuclear medicine bone scan must do within 60 day registration . Baseline PSA testosterone must do 60 day registration repeat week radiotherapy document response androgen deprivation therapy . Physician assessment must do within 60 day randomization . Baseline QOL assessment ( EPIC ) , prostate symptom score ( IPSS ) , sexual health inventory ( SHIM ) do prior start radiotherapy . Assessments radiotherapy : All patient see radiation oncologist ( clinical associate ) weekly radiotherapy . QOL assessment ( EPIC ) , IPSS/SHIM , adverse event assessment ( CTCAEv4 , modify Radiation Therapy Oncology Group ( RTOG ) /SOMA ) do week 5 radiotherapy Arms 1 2 . Post-radiotherapy assessment follow-up : All patient assess 2 week 8 week post-radiotherapy , every 6 month 2 year , yearly year 5 . At time point patient undergo physician assessment , PSA/testosterone , QOL assessment ( EPIC ) , IPSS/SHIM , adverse event assessment ( CTCAEv4 , modify RTOG/SOMA ) . Data Analysis Actuarial rate acute ( defined occur ≤ 6 month initiation treatment ) late ( defined occur &gt; 6 month initiation treatment ) well prevalence late toxicity 1 , 2 5 year determine . Grade 3 4 toxicity compare intervention group use exact test statistic ( SAS FREQ procedure , SAS Gary , NC ) . Stratified analysis also use SAS FREQ procedure Zelen 's exact test equal odds ratio , exact confidence limit common odds ratio , exact test common odds ratio . Quality life score EPIC scale compare intervention use t-test statistic .</detailed_description>
