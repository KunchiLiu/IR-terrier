	<brief_summary>Heart Failure ( HF ) affect 5.7 million Americans major cardiovascular disorder rise . The primary aim study formally study combined effect several different tele-health modality , currently approve available general use , determine combination result increase early intervention resultant decrease acute cardiac decompensation require hospitalization Emergency Room ( ER ) visit . This study attempt characterize frequency health care intervention attributable use technology , relationship intervention frequency hospitalization ER visit . Secondary objective include characterization healthcare utilization , healthcare cost , patient experience regard use provide technology .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It estimate 400,000 700,000 new case heart failure ( HF ) diagnose year number death United States chronic condition double since 1979 - average 275,000 annually . HF account 1.1 million annual hospital discharge , 3.4 million physician office visit , 668,000 emergency department visit , 293,000 outpatient visit per year . The economic impact equally stagger : total estimate annual cost heart failure exceed $ 40 billion . This figure expect reach $ 97 billion 2030 . While initial hospitalization consume vast amount health care resource , readmission also significant problem . The overall readmission rate ( cause ) United States 19.6 % . Studies show 30-day readmission rate HF 24 % . The important clinical implication patient particularly vulnerable early post-discharge period ( 30-90 day hospital home ) require heighten surveillance , especially hospital admission prolong patient prior admission worsen HF . Despite advance pharmacologic monitoring device therapy , inability effectively manage influence patient behavior inability patient identify sign symptom decompensated HF major hurdle improve outcome avoid subsequent readmission . Less 10 % HF patient eligible implantable monitoring device due variety reason . Non-invasive cardiac telemetry unit monitor patient 's echocardiograph ( ECG ) . HF patient present numerous physiologic parameter largely go unmonitored change status undetected discharge hospital home . A worsening status one indicator may predict worsen condition decompensation . This gap leave tremendous percentage ( majority , fact ) HF population risk repeat medical crisis re-hospitalizations . Managing HF patient population require highly skilled clinician , stringent monitoring care coordination , advance technology integration . The investigator propose patient-centered non-invasive remote monitoring care system HF . This model leverage three distinct technology platform . This unique care plan bring together physiologic data capture symptomatic behavioral patient information dynamic patient engagement education mobile platform analyzes , predict notifies clinicians patient 's baseline health change lead negative health consequence subsequent hospital re-admission ER visit . 1 . A small cutaneous Mobile Patient Monitoring patch ( SEEQ® ) Medtronic continuously collect ECG data , plus heart rate , heart rate variability , respiratory rate , atrial fibrillation status . These add physiologic parameter provide clinician precise insight patient 's condition clearly differentiate monitor technology standard approach . The Medtronic patch apply like band-aid patient 's chest prior hospital discharge . As collect data , information wirelessly transmit via Bluetooth patient care platform provider access information live-time 30 day post discharge . Medtronic 's patch require lead like commercially available system , need remove bath normal activity . Thus product increase patient compliance enhances satisfaction . An increase patient compliance ensure complete accurate picture patient 's health . Captured data use 1 ) provide clinicians physiological data patient risk near-term decompensated HF , 2 ) allow clinician deliver live-time treatment intervention guidance anywhere time , prevent health problem escalate health crisis . Another key differentiator care model patient 's use tablet-based tele-health mobile software application include patient 's discharge plan , daily medication management list , reminder , CHAT feature live , interactive communication care team . The software assess patient 's psychosocial status enables clinician coach guide patient change negative health behavior adhere care plan . 2 . Medtronic 's Cardiocom system deploy proprietary cellular-based patient interface tool ( Commander Flex ) , blood pressure cuff interface directly Commander Flex Bluetooth enable medical-grade scale also interfaces directly Commander Flex . The patient require take blood pressure weight measurement prescribe interval evaluation period ( 30 day ) well answer variety behavioral symptomatic question operate proprietary tree-based question algorithm . 3 . Docview® mHealth solution encourage self-management empowers patient become stakeholder health . The application collect real-time data regular `` check-in '' analyze state wellness , enable patient connect live care team - matter . The entire process take less one minute complete answer provide care team actionable risk-stratification snapshot . Automating process allow large patient population monitor , yet drastically reduce provider-patient involvement , at-risk patient need notify ( 10-15 % estimate ) . In traditional setting , monitor team typically call every patient could maintain caseload 20-25 patient ( average call time 20-25 min ) . All patient contact phone determine risk exists . The propose tele-health solution use real-time data analysis predictive modeling proactively notify provider patient 's baseline health change prior negative health issue , quickly deliver intervention patient base clinical decision statistically validate treatment algorithm . This unique care plan bring together physiologic data capture symptomatic behavioral patient information dynamic patient engagement education mobile platform analyzes , predict notifies clinicians patient 's baseline health change lead negative health consequence subsequent hospital re-admission ER visit .</detailed_description>
