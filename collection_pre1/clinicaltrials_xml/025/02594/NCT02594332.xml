	<brief_title>Effects Mepolizumab Compared Placebo Airway Physiology Patients With Eosinophilic Asthma : MEMORY Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Asthma eosinophilic inflammation airway and/or blood eosinophilia associate clinical severity include risk exacerbation relevant comorbidities ( e.g . nasal polyposis ) . Interleukin-5 ( IL-5 ) cytokine essential eosinophil traffic survival . Clinical trial block IL-5 anti-IL-5 antibody ( mepolizumab reslizumab ) patient uncontrolled eosinophilic asthma result improvement exacerbation rate oral corticosteroid use . In study mepolizumab reslizumab beneficial effect lung function ( FEV1 ) . In addition , many patient describe profound impact asthma symptom quality life personal report uniformly reflect clinical trial . The MEMORY trial first primarily evaluate effect mepolizumab treatment pulmonary function patient severe eosinophilic asthma . Importantly , use spirometry bodyplethysmography allow evaluate additional parameter beyond FEV1 closely mirror pathophysiological change functional aspect airflow limitation asthma real life , e.g . airway resistance , hyperinflation diffusion capacity . The propose trial answer important question : , , parameter airway ( patho- ) physiology assess bodyplethysmography best reflect clinical response mepolizumab therapy patient severe eosinophilic asthma . In addition , time course clinical response assess . Equally important , loose correlation FEV1 parameter asthma control asthma-related quality life . This another new important aspect trial carefully monitor asthma control asthma quality life correlation lung function change beyond FEV1 . Finally , tempt speculate propose trial contribute question best define clinical response mepolizumab .</detailed_description>

Physiciandiagnosis asthma evidence asthma document either reversibility airflow obstruction ( FEV1 ≥ 12 % 200 ml ) demonstrate visit 1 visit 2 . 4 . ICS dose must ≥ 1000 μg/day BDP equivalent daily without maintenance oral corticosteroid . 5 . Treatment past 12 month additional controller medication least 3 successive month , e.g. , longacting beta2agonist ( LABA ) , leukotriene receptor antagonist ( LTRA ) , theophylline . 6 . Persistent airflow obstruction indicate prebronchodilator FEV1 &lt; 80 % predict recorded Visit 1 &lt; 90 % patient oral corticosteroid . 7 . An elevated peripheral blood eosinophil level ≥ 300/µL related asthma ≥ 150/µL patient treated oral corticosteroid maintenance therapy demonstrate visit 1 previous 12 month 8 . Confirmed history two exacerbation require treatment systemic corticosteroid ( intramuscular , intravenous , oral ) , 12 month prior visit 1 , despite use highdose inhaled corticosteroid . For patient receive maintenance corticosteroid , corticosteroid treatment exacerbation must twofold increase great dose . 1 . Current smoker former smoker smoke history ≥ 10 pack year ( number pack year = ( number cigarette per day / 20 ) x number year smoke ) . Patients smoke ≥ 6 month visit 1 &lt; 10 pack year include study . 2 . Presence clinically important lung condition asthma . This include current infection , bronchiectasis , pulmonary fibrosis , bronchopulmonary aspergillosis , diagnose emphysema chronic bronchitis ( chronic obstructive pulmonary disease asthma ) history lung cancer . 3 . Patients receive omalizumab [ Xolair ] within 130 day Visit 1 . 4 . Patients receive biological treat inflammatory disease within 5 halflives visit 1</criteria>
