	<brief_summary>Background : Influenza A H3N2 flu virus . Symptoms include fever , cough , runny nose . It also serious . Researchers want know influenza cause disease people . They hope develop new vaccine treatment flu infection . Objective : To find small amount Influenza A H3N2 virus cause mild moderate flu infection healthy people . Also , study body immune response virus infection develop . Eligibility : Healthy people age 18 50 : Non-smokers non-habitual smoker Willing smoke least 9 day Design : Participants screen NIAID protocol # 11-I-0183 Participants stay isolation unit clinic least 9 day . They remain isolation unit except study-specific activity . The influenza virus spray nose . Participants monitor 24 hour day . They test , include : Medical history Physical exam Daily questionnaire symptoms Blood urine test Nasal wash swab : A small tube salt water place nose wash . It collect fluid . Or inside nose rubbed swab . ECG : Measures heart electrical signal ECHO : Sound wave take picture heart PFTs/Spirometry : They blow machine measure air blow . Participants discharge test negative influenza A . Participants return clinic 4 follow-up visit 8 week . They may complete questionnaire home .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Influenza A H3N2 Human Challenge Study Healthy Adult Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The high morbidity mortality associate pandemic seasonal influenza , anticipation future influenza pandemic , put influenza front center infectious disease research . Because natural history pathogenesis human influenza well characterize adequately study animal model current vitro technique , important question influenza pathogenesis approach human challenge study . Although study influenza healthy volunteer play important role address aspect natural history influenza disease develop novel antiviral , prior recently important study perform US decade . The H1N1 challenge study perform since 2012 seek improve upon study do past address many limitation due scope study and/or scientific technique available time . We successfully develop H1N1 model use address important question regard correlate protection implement develop new drug vaccine . We hope develop H3N2 model useful . The primary objective study determine dose influenza A H3N2 human challenge virus induce mild moderate uncomplicated influenza infection healthy volunteer . This protocol examine basic question remain unanswered regard pathogenesis H3N2 influenza human , namely , detailed clinical immunological characterization uncomplicated influenza viral pathogenesis healthy adult volunteer . Secondary objective evaluate clinical disease , length viral shedding , pathogenesis influenza infection include identification clinical marker disease . Notably , exploratory objective seek discover viral factor necessary human infection/adaptation evaluate host immune response , viral replication , viral fitness , intrahost evolution . Collaboration NIAID investigator outside scientist generate opportunity develop expand area clinical influenza research base propose H3N2 challenge model .</detailed_description>
