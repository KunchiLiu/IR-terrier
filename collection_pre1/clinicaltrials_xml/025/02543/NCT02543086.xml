	<detailed_description>This single center multiple sequential Cohort study divide 2 part ( Part A part B ) . A total 8 healthy volunteer per cohort enrol Part A , focus characterize antiparasitic activity KAE609 single dose administration human Induced Blood Stage Malaria model . Once Part A complete , Part B evaluate effect KAE609 follow pre-treatment Piperaquine sexual stage/gametocytemia activity inhibitor onward transmission mosquito vector use experimental mosquito feeding assay . For Part A threshold commencement treatment individual subject occur Quantitative-Polymerase Chain Reaction quantification participant Cohort ≥ 1,000 parasites/mL Quantitative-Polymerase Chain Reaction quantification participant ≥ 5,000 parasites/mL , clinical evidence malaria , define Clinical symptom score ≥6 . The First cohort dose single dose KAE609 . During Part A , additional second single-dose KAE609 subsequent cohort may test ( ~15 day first dose KAE609 may vary ) sexual parasitemia identify . Subsequent cohort part A ( An ) dose base result first cohort ( A1 ) . For Part B , threshold commencement treatment individual subject Polymerase Chain Reaction quantification participant ≥ 5,000 parasites/mL Polymerase Chain Reaction quantification participant ≥ 5,000 parasites/mL accompany clinical symptom score ≥6 , participant reach treatment threshold ( PCR quantification ≥ 5,000 ) , treatment participant begin within 24 h period . Cohort B receive pre-treatment Piperaquine ( 480 mg ) follow KAE609 ( ~15 day ) Piperaquine . Following initial treatment KAE609 ( Part A ) Piperaquine ( Part B ) Day 1 , participant follow in-subjects least 72 hour ensure tolerance treatment clinical response . If subject clinically well per judgment Investigator , discharge monitored outpatient basis safety clearance malaria parasites via Quantitative-Polymerase Chain Reaction . If study subject cohort Part A show evidence gametocytemia initial treatment KAE609 , second single-dose KAE609 administer subject patient . In part B significant gametocytemia expect initial Piperaquine treatment expect clear gametocyte , single dose KAE609 administer time peak gametocytemia . The KAE609 dose Part B select study , base Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic safety analysis Part A . If recrudescent asexual parasitemia identify , compulsory commencement rescue medication use . Treatment recrudescence single dose Piperaquine Part A . In addition , compulsory terminal curative treatment administer participant end study . Participants monitor three day ensure adherence rescue medication therapy . Adverse event monitor via telephone monitoring , within clinical research unit , out-subject review malaria challenge inoculation antimalarial study drug administration . Blood sample safety evaluation , malaria monitoring , red blood cell antibody draw screen and/ baseline nominate time malaria challenge .</detailed_description>
