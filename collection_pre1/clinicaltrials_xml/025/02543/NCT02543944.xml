	<brief_title>Improving Treatment Outcomes Prescription Opioid Dependence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Opioid dependence serious public health problem , particularly dramatic rise prescription opioid abuse , long-term opioid agonist maintenance methadone buprenorphine ( BUP ) may optimal many prescription opioid abuser . Yet current opioid detoxification strategy limit high relapse rate and/or lack efficacy relieve subjective symptom . In addition , antagonist maintenance naltrexone ( NTX ) , may optimal longer-term strategy population , require prior opioid detoxification associate relatively poor outcome heroin abuser . This application take novel , broad approach address problem prescription opioid dependence determine 1 ) utility adjunct gabapentin ( GBP ) outpatient BUP detoxification improve initial outcome 2 ) feasibility transition prescription opioid -dependent patient depot NTX follow detoxification , may improve longer-term outcome . GBP , N-type calcium channel blocker low abuse potential , potentiate opioid analgesia , decrease postoperative morphine consumption movement-related pain , reverse tolerance antinociceptive effect morphine . GBP also well tolerated effective reduce crave illicit opioid use pilot detoxification trial . The efficacy tolerability adjunct GBP BUP-assisted detoxification feasibility subsequent transition depot NTX therapy prescription opioid -dependent participant assess . This 8-week , randomize , placebo-controlled clinical trial determine potential utility adjunct GBP 150 prescription opioid -dependent individual undergo outpatient BUP detoxification whether transition short-term depot NTX therapy feasible . Our three specific aim determine ( 1 ) efficacy tolerability GBP reduce crave illicit use opioids prescription opioid-dependent individual undergoing outpatient BUP detoxification ; ( 2 ) acceptability feasibility transition , short-term maintenance , depot NTX follow detoxification ; ( 3 ) prognosticator completion BUP taper , successful induction onto depot NTX , symptomatology , longer-term outcome . Currently , FDA-approved medication treatment opioid withdrawal opioid agonists methadone BUP , abuse liability , NTX , produce low level withdrawal-like symptom , especially early treatment . Findings , positive , support development GBP adjunct medication well provide integrate , seamless approach outpatient prescription opioid-dependence treatment . Ultimately , work could impact addiction field provide procedural pharmacological tool treat prescription opioid dependence significantly improve outpatient detoxification outcomes markedly enhance access transition NTX therapy . This would shift clinical practice , establish effective adjunct regimen BUP detoxification integrate approach transition NTX therapy . GBP may also clinically useful situation opioid withdrawal concern .</detailed_description>
