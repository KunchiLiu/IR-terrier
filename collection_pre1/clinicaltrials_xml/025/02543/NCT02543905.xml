	<brief_title>The PROFILE Study : Germline Genetic Profiling : Correlation With Targeted Prostate Cancer Screening Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose Design The aim PROFILE study investigate role target prostate cancer screen men family history disease role specific genetic profile biomarkers ( biological sample DWMRI ) . This study design use observational approach look correlation cancer incidence ( biopsy ) genetic profile . The aim evaluate target screen prostate cancer men family history disease , estimate incidence prostate cancer sensitivity specificity PSA screening population correlate single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) profile biological endpoint . Two cohort recruit : 1 . Men family history prostate cancer . 2 . Men AfroCaribbean descent . Men prior screen offer immediate biopsy genetic profiling . This provide data genetic profiling correlation biopsy irrespective PSA men previous screening . A PSA screening algorithm consider alternative biopsy great controversy PSA threshold use cut-off . Recent data show considerable percentage men PSA within normal range cancer biopsy . Therefore decide Steering Committee participant offer biopsy within study . This tell u acceptability approach . Some men may opt biopsy . These men follow six monthly PSA biopsy perform PSA equal 1.0ng/ml man age 50 year , PSA equal 2.0ng/ml man age fifty year . Eligibility Recruitment Men either : 1 . A positive family history PrCa define : - Men first degree relative ( second degree female line ) histologically death certificate prove PrCa diagnose &lt; 70 year - Men two relative side family histologically death certificate prove PrCa least one diagnose &lt; 70 year - Men three relative side family histologically death certificate prove PrCa diagnose age 2 . Of African Caribbean ancestry define : Both parent 4 grandparent origin - Age 40- 69 year - WHO performance status 02 ( see Appendix A ) - Absence psychological , familial , sociological geographical situation potentially hamper compliance study protocol follow schedule . Exclusion criterion - Previous cancer life expectancy less five year . - Previous PrCa - Negative biopsy within one year recruitment - Comorbidities make prostate biopsy risk unacceptable ( Warfarin Clopidogrel ) . - Contraindications MRI ( pacemaker , aneurysm clip , claustrophobia ) Subject Withdrawal Subjects may withdraw study time wish without give reason . No data collect individual , unused sample destroy . Data collect point retain audit purpose . Cancer case Men find prostate cancer biopsy refer local urologist treatment accord local policy . Men follow 10 year order evaluate different treatment regimen . Genetic Profiling All men genetic profile correlate disease status men give result test . It emphasise research result write information provide reference guide . Informed Consent All subject inform aim study , possible adverse event , procedure possible hazard expose , mechanism treatment allocation prostate cancer diagnose . He inform strict confidentiality patient data , medical record may review trial purpose authorise individual treat physician . It emphasise participation voluntary subject allow refuse participation protocol whenever want . This prejudice subject 's subsequent care . Documented informed consent obtain , accord principal good clinical practice ( GCP ) , subject include study register onto study . Risks , burden , benefit There risk complication prostate biopsy , complication detail patient information sheet , together likelihood incidence . Complications rare standard procedure follow site minimise occurrence . The benefit take part may prostate cancer may diagnose men previously unaware disease . While potential overdiagnosis indolent disease , also potential detect treat clinically significant disease . Provision result genetic profile One consideration occurrence anxiety result take part study , particularly receive research genetic test result . There considerable uncertainty genetic profile relates predict risk prostate cancer . For reason individualise write information provide participant put research result context current population risk . It stress research result investigator fully understand mean result . A psychosocial study run concurrently explore issue depth participant 's experience receiving result important component evaluation study . Confidentiality All information collect accessible immediate study team . Any data share de-identified publish data anonymised participant recognisable result . Medical record data collect study may look authorised person Institute Cancer Research , regulatory authority authorise people check study carry correctly . All duty confidentiality participant . End Study Follow−up After participant complete study advise ongoing screen follow−up require . This organised participant general practitioner ( GP ) . Use sample future research The informed consent process explain sample donate `` gift '' . If sample collect consider use future research project would approve Ethics Committee first .</detailed_description>
