	<brief_summary>The primary objective study determine feasibility detect sentinel lymph node ( SLN ) patient early invasive cervical cancer use combine radioisotope blue dye technique . The investigator hypothesize sentinel lymph node ( first node drain tumour/cervix ) early stage cervical cancer represent status regional lymph node basin ( pelvic lymph node ) identification negative SLN would negate need complete pelvic lymphadenectomy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sentinel Lymph Node Detection Early Cervical Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cancers cervix small appear contain cervix ( early stage ) 20 percent chance pelvic lymph node involve . The standard therapy removal uterus cervix ( radical hysterectomy ) removal pelvic lymph node woman early stage cervical cancer . This procedure associate significant intraoperative postoperative complication include increase risk damage blood vessel nerve pelvic region ( lead bladder , bowel sexual dysfunction ) well lymphedema ( swell , particularly leg ) associate significant pelvic lymph tissue removal . The objective study find way accurately identify first lymph node drain tumour/cervix ( SLN ) . If SLN correctly identify , 's status ( positive negative malignancy ) representative entire lymph node basin , complete node dissection could avoid . This could benefit many woman early stage cervical cancer , minority actually evidence disease node surgery ( 5-20 % ) limit lymph node sampling could prevent associated complication full pelvic lymph node dissection . This prospective cohort study . The population study patient newly diagnose early stage cervical cancer undergo primary surgical intervention include radical hysterectomy bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy . On morning surgery , preoperative injection radiolabeled colloid perform Nuclear Medicine Department follow SPECT/CT visualize radiolabelled dye . Patients take operate room plan procedure . After initiation general anesthesia , blue dye inject patient 's cervix . The surgery proceed lymph node `` blue '' and/or `` hot '' remove surgically , anatomic location laterality document sent frozen section intraoperatively . The radical hysterectomy radical trachelectomy complete systematic bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy perform . The SLN status report pathologist base frozen section compare status node remove complete lymphadenectomy report final pathology report ( formalin fixation paraffin embed ) . All data patient prospectively collect . This protocol determine feasibility SLN mapping woman early stage cervical cancer . The primary outcome measure rate detection SLN use combination radiolabelled blue dye ( unilateral bilateral detection rate report ) well sensitivity specificity technique , base assess well intraoperative reading SLN frozen section correspond final pathology lymph node status examine lymph node remove complete pelvic lymphadenectomy . In addition , investigator assess usefulness preoperative SPECT/CT identify SLN whether modality accurately identify lymph node basin contain SLN compare conventional lymphoscintigram .</detailed_description>
