	<brief_summary>Aim study determination ideal timepoint treatment patient acute Non-ST-segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction ( NSTEMI ) acute chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) GRACE score &lt; 140 . It determine prompt coronary angiography protection kidney use contrast agent important outcome patient . Additionally investigated ischemic precondition help prevent heart damage .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optimised Procedure Patients With NSTEMI CKD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>According international guideline coronary angiography perform within 72h patient ( NSTEMI ) . Patients GRACE score &gt; 140 belong high risk group coronary angiography perform within 24h . Until today patient GRACE score &gt; 140 acute chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) best approach know even though 40 % NESTMI patient belong population . CKD connection NSTEMI one predictor short long term mortality serious bleed complication coronary angiography . Additionally patient CKD risk experience contrast agent induce aggravation CKD right kidney failure . The pre- post treatment kidney seem reduce risk . The irrigation kidneys 48h prior coronary angiography optimise kidney function buffer aggravation kidney function cause fluid loss abstention home . Additionally influence ischemic precondition one arm patient evaluate set . First study give hint kidney may protect contrast agent follow catheter examination ischemic precondition .</detailed_description>
