	<detailed_description>A non-randomised observational study validate Structured Light Plethysmography three group participant : stable asthma acute asthma , undergo routine clinical investigation broncho-reversibility use spirometry . We also observe normal healthy group receive clinical intervention . SLP data capture spirometry ( part patient clinical care ) perform Bronchodilator reversibility test part patient normal clinical care ( except normal healthy group bronchodilator give ) . The data collect study allow u examine effect bronchodilator breathe pattern patient also compare breathe pattern asthma patient healthy individual . The participant wear plain white t-shirt . Alternatively , measurement take bare skin participant ( female ) wear plain material white bra . The participant ask sit chair lie neck neutral position back straight possible front SLP device ( Thora-3Di , Pneumacare Ltd ) . The projector line project grid light participant 's chest upper abdomen . instructed perform period 5 minute tidal breathing , They otherwise ask remain still possible throughout measurement . During sequence breathing , thoracoabdominal wall movement capture device . participant completion Bronchodilator Challenge within Lung Function Department clinic The SLP measurement repeat completion Bronchodilator reversibility test within Lung Function Department clinic .</detailed_description>
