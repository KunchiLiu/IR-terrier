	<brief_summary>Background : There good treatment people consider suicide . Researchers want study suicide question , blood test , brain imaging , sleep study . They hope good understand suicide , help suicidal people . Objective : To understand happens brain someone think attempt suicide . Eligibility : Group 1 : Adults age 18 70 thought attempt suicide recently Group 2 : Adults age 18 70 thought attempt suicide past Group 3 : Adults age 18 70 depression anxiety , never think suicide Group 4 : Healthy volunteer age . Design : Participants screen another protocol . Adults recently think attempted suicide must refer doctor . They may 3 phase study . Groups 2 , 3 4 Phase 1 get ketamine . Phase 1 : 1 week hospital . Participants : Physical exam . Questions thought feeling . Thinking memory test simple task . Blood urine test . Two MRI scan . Participants lie table slide metal cylinder take picture . They coil head earplugs computer task . Sleep test . Disks band place body monitor sleep . Magnetic detector head perform task . A wrist monitor activity sleep . Lumbar puncture ( optional ) . A needle collect fluid back . Shock experiment ( optional ) . Participants observe picture sound feel small shock hand . Phase 2 : 4 day hospital . A thin plastic tube place arm , one blood draw , get drug ketamine . Participants repeat Phase 1 test . Phase 3 : 4 ketamine dos 2 week . Participants follow-up call visit 6 month maybe yearly 5 year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A . Objective Suicide occur across demographic psychiatric disorder , kill least one million individual worldwide year . In contrast injury-related death homicide motor vehicle accident , suicide rate increase , particularly among middle-aged adult . Clinicians limited ability predict imminent suicidal behavior , , efficacious treatment available treat suicidal patient . Advances treatment suicidal patient hamper incomplete understanding neurobiological underpinnings suicidal crisis , suicidal thought behavior clearly link specific neural circuit . The aim study evaluate possible biomarkers suicidal thought behavior individual currently experience suicidal crisis . In take dimensional approach suicide research , able study phenomenology across Research Domain Criteria ( RDoC ) unit analysis , gene circuit self-report experimental paradigm . Through approach , identify potential neurobiological risk factor short long-term suicide risk . As secondary aim , use ketamine identify biomarkers ketamine response sample acute risk suicide . B . Study Population Four participant population recruit protocol order encompass continuum suicide risk . A total 170 individual enrol study . Participant population individual follow condition : 1 . ) recent suicidal ideation intent and/or suicide attempt ( Group 1- active crisis , n= 50 ) ; 2 ) past history suicide attempt , suicidal behavior last year ( Group 2 , n= 40 ) ; 3 ) anxiety mood symptom , recent past suicidal thought behavior ( Group 3 , n= 40 ) ; , 4 ) healthy control psychiatric suicide history ( Group 4 , n= 40 ) . C. Design The research protocol occur across three phase : baseline , ketamine response optional repeated infusion . All participant first consent Phase I , may last seven day . This baseline phase entail multimodal assessment , use pathophysiological marker ( blood draw , lumbar puncture ) , neuroimaging ( fMRI , MEG ) , polysomnography , clinical rating experimental paradigm ( shock experiment ) . Participants receive regularly schedule daily medication , receive additional treatment ( include new prn medication , benzodiazepine management anxiety agitation ) brief baseline phase . After completion Phase I , eligible participant Group 1 ( active crisis ) offer participation Phase II , ketamine response phase . This phase , last four day , consist single , open-label trial ketamine ( 0.5 mg/kg ) . The focus phase identification potential biomarkers antisuicidal ketamine response . Participants complete Phase II offer Phase III , involve repeat ketamine infusion two week ( 2 times/ per week 2 week ) . Psychiatric medication adjustment permit Phase III . After participation Phases I-III , participant Groups 1-3 offer standard clinical treatment ( exclude healthy control ) , participation another protocol . In standard clinical treatment , adjustment psychiatric medication commencement psychotherapeutic intervention permit . Finally , participant first three group ( exclude healthy control ) receive follow-up evaluation six month yearly evaluation 5 year study participation . D. Outcome Measures In Phase I , outcome measure underlie psychiatric , psychological , neuroimaging , sleep biological difference participant group . In Phase II , outcome measure reduction suicidal thought depressive anxiety symptom 24 hour post-ketamine infusion .</detailed_description>
