	<brief_summary>An Endoscopic retrograde cholangio pancreatography ( ERCP ) cholangioscopy ( endoscope directly visualize bile duct ) procedure ( small flexible tube insert participant mouth participant stomach participant liver visualize bile duct ) usually perform patient follow purpose : 1 . The removal stone participant bile duct ( present ) . 2 . Acquiring tissue sample biopsy common bile mass examine ( present ) . 3 . Acquiring tissue sample biopsy common bile duct narrowing ( present ) . However procedure associate increase risk infection compare standard ERCP ( ERCP without cholangioscopy ) . Previous study show despite administration antibiotic prior procedure , infection still occur . This lead suspicion factor may cause infection . Factors age , race , gender ethnicity fully explore yet . This study aim examine factor addition others patient undergo ERCP cholangioscopy part routine medical care . This examination allow u bring mentioned factor may involve development infection ERCP cholangioscopy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Factors Associated With Increased Risk Bacteremia Cholangitis ERCP With Cholangioscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ERCP cholangioscopy become widespread technique treat complicate choledocholithiasis , document CBD clearance stone extraction ass biliary duct stricture . During procedure , large amount water use irrigate common bile duct order improve visualization . This result CBD distension may increase possibility bacterial translocation subsequent bacteremia septicemia . According ASGE guideline , antibiotic prophylaxis prior ERCP indicate biliary duct obstruction suspect prior ERCP procedure . There current guideline address antibiotic prophylaxis prior ERCP cholangioscopy . The investigator recent ACG fund prospective trial examine risk bacteremia ERCP cholangioscopy show presence bacteremia 8.8 % patient undergoing ERCP cholangioscopy , thus prompt use prophylactic antibiotic patient undergoing procedure . However study power examine factor associate increased bacteremia infectious complication . In spite use pre-procedural antibiotic publish series , infectious complication cholangitis sepsis still report procedure . In landmark study Chen et al , 297 patient prospectively underwent single-operator cholangioscopy 15 referral center across US Europe , nine patient develop cholangitis . Antibiotics administration prior procedures left standard practice participate institution report study . In retrospective study Kalaitzakis et al , nine 179 patient underwent cholangioscopy CBD stricture treatment CBD stone develop cholangitis . Cholangitis fatal one case require prolonged hospitalization case . All patient study antibiotic prophylaxis prior procedure . Manta et al one case cholangitis series 52 patient underwent cholangioscopy CBD stricture . Two patient 87 patient cholangitis study Osania et al. , prospectively include patient underwent cholangioscopy CBD stricture . The cholangitis rate previously mention study range 2 % 5 % . This high rate post procedure cholangitis spite use pre-procedural antibiotic suggest post procedure antibiotic value subsets patient undergo ERCP cholangioscopy . In investigator preliminary data , bacteremia rate significantly high patient CBD strictures cholangioscopy biopsy . It possible stricture could lead colonization biliary epithelium bacteria . Obtaining biopsy may cause disruption endothelial barrier allow bacterial translocation . In addition , cholangitis see one patient investigator cohort underwent laser lithotripsy large stone . Choledocholithiasis another source bacterial colonization could increase risk cholangitis ERCP cholangioscopy . The investigator protocol objective examine factor potentially associate increased frequency bacteremia subsequent infectious complication ERCP cholangioscopy set uniform pre-procedure antibiotic . The investigator hypothesize biopsy CBD strictures Laser Lithotripsy risk factor increase rate bacteremia infectious complication ERCP cholangioscopy .</detailed_description>
