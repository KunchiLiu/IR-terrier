	<brief_summary>Following tooth extraction ridge preservation procedure suggest limit bone resorptive dimensional change facilitate prospective implant placement . While particularly true anterior teeth , evidence available establish clinical guideline posterior site , i.e . follow molar extraction . This research project answer follow question : What dimensional change hard soft tissue encounter follow molar extraction without ridge preservation ?</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients include study qualify follow inclusion criterion : One molar tooth identified dental faculty require single tooth extraction A dental implant indicate treatment plan replace miss molar tooth Have adequate restorative space dental implantretained restoration Have least 10mm alveolar bone height , without impinge maxillary sinus inferior alveolar canal . Obvious exclusion patient meet inclusion criterion cooperate followup schedule . Patients enter mentally incompetent , prisoner , pregnant . Pregnant woman woman intend become pregnant study period . As standard practice prior dental surgery , females childbearing age ask verbally possibility pregnant . If , proceed surgery pregnancy test do . If woman state possibility pregnant , urine pregnancy test rule pregnancy . So use urine pregnancy test do say may pregnant . [ If need : An overthecounter urine pregnancy test provide female subject graduate periodontics clinic UTHSCSA . Patients allow access private restroom result test read one name investigator . Only negative preoperative pregnancy test eligible study . ] Female patient undergone hysterectomy , tubal ligation menopause exclude pregnancy test . Patients become pregnant study withdraw standard care deliver . Clinical and/or radiographic determination preclude inclusion study : Active localize systemic infection periodontitis . Untreated periodontal disease Inadequate bone dimension restorative space dimension place dental implant Presence disease entity , medical condition therapeutic regimen decrease probability soft tissue bony healing , e.g. , poorly control diabetes , chemotherapeutic immunosuppressive agent , autoimmune disease . Positive medical history endocarditis follow oral dental surgery .</criteria>
