	<brief_summary>This randomized program evaluation undertaken conjunction Department Veterans Affairs Office Mental Health Operations Quality Enhancement Research Initiative . It design answer two related question : ( 1 ) Can evidence-based implementation strategy use CDC 's Replicating Effective Programs plus External Facilitation ( REP-F ) enhance adoption team-based care VA General Mental Health Clinics , ( 2 ) Does establishment team via implementation enhance Veterans ' health status , satisfaction , perception care ? The model team-based care evidence-based Collaborative Chronic Care Model ( CCM ) . In conjunction nation-wide roll-out VA 's Behavioral Health Interdisciplinary Program team ( BHIP ) initiative , investigator structure randomize , control program evaluation answer question . Specifically , use step wedge design investigator randomize 9 VAMCs request support establish BHIP 1 3 wave REP-F support : immediate implementation support vs. 4-month vs. 8-month wait dissemination CCM material ( 3 site per wave ) . Fidelity health outcome measure collect repeat measure design 6-month interval , analyze general linear modeling .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hybrid Collaborative Care Randomized Program Evaluation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Based internal system-wide review mental health service Mental Health Action Plan submit Congress November , 2011 , OMHO undertaken effort establish BHIPs , intend provide GMH care throughout VA . The BHIP goal build effective interdisciplinary team , provide majority care Veterans GMH . It expect every VAMC establish least one BHIP current initial phase ( begin late FY2013 ) , effort scale-up subsequently . Not surprisingly , progress uneven . In 2015 OMHO incorporate Collaborative Chronic Care Model ( CCM ) evidence-based model structure BHIPs . Consistent BHIP goal , CCMs develop provide anticipatory , continuous , collaborative , evidence-based care . CCMs consist 6 element : delivery system redesign , use clinical information system , provider decision support , patient self-management support , linkage community resource , healthcare organization support . Replicating Effective Programs External Facilitation ( REP-F ) show effective implementing complex care model , include CCMs MH , within beyond VHA . Thus conjunction OMHO , investigator propose project Specific Aim evaluate impact REP-F implement CCM-based BHIPs effect Veteran health status . The investigator propose Hybrid Type III implementation-effectiveness step wedge control trial , specifically hypothesize : H1 : REP-F-based implementation establish CCM-based BHIPs , compare exist centralized technical assistance result : ( H1a ) increase Veteran perception CCM-based care , ( H1b ) high rate achieve national BHIP clinical fidelity measure ( implementation outcomes ) , ( H1c ) high provider rating presence CCM element . H2 : CCM-based BHIPs , support REP-F implementation , result improve Veteran health outcome compare BHIPs support dissemination material alone ( intervention outcomes ) . The investigator utilize national BHIP rollout vehicle project . Using step wedge design investigator randomize 9 VAMCs request support establish BHIP 1 3 wave REP-F support : immediate implementation support vs. 4-month vs. 8-month wait dissemination CCM material ( 3 site per wave ) . Fidelity health outcome measure collect repeat measure design 6-month interval , analyze general linear modeling .</detailed_description>
