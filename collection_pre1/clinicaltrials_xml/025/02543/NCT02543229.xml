	<brief_summary>The purpose first-in-human study evaluate safety , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) pharmacodynamics OPT-302 administer monthly intravitreal injection 3 month without Lucentis™ patient wet age relate macular degeneration ( AMD ) . This study conduct two part : Part 1 comprise open label , sequential dose escalation Part 2 randomize dose expansion . OPT-302 soluble form VEGFR-3 comprising extracellular domains 1-3 human vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ( VEGFR ) -3 Fc fragment human IgG1 . It function bind neutralize activity vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) -C VEGF-D endogenous VEGFR-2 VEGFR-3 . VEGF-C VEGF-D promote blood vessel development ( angiogenesis ) bind activate VEGFR-2 VEGFR-3 . VEGF-C also potent inducer vascular permeability leakage . Angiogenesis vascular leakage key hallmark wet AMD . Approved therapy wet AMD include Eylea™ Lucentis™ block activity VEGF-A , VEGF-C VEGF-D alternate member family molecule . VEGF-C VEGF-D stimulate blood vessel growth leakage pathway VEGF-A ( via VEGFR-2 ) , well pathways independent VEGF-A ( via VEGFR-3 ) . Published study also indicate VEGF-C VEGF-D play important role mediate resistance therapy block VEGF-A Lucentis™ Eylea™ . Combination therapy OPT-302 anti-VEGF-A agent provide complete blockade VEGF family . This strategy target functional redundancy VEGF pathway mechanisms 'resistance ' sub-response VEGF-A inhibition .</brief_summary>
