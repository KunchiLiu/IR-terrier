	<brief_title>SUPREME-HN A Retrospective Cohort Study PD-L1 Recurrent Metastatic Squamous Cell Carcinoma Head Neck ( SCCHN )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background/Rationale : Programmed cell death protein 1 ( PD-1 ) immune inhibitory receptor interacts two ligand , program death ligand 1 ( PD-L1 ) ligand 2 ( PD-L2 ) . PD-1 pathway major immune checkpoint implicate adaptive immune resistance squamous cell carcinoma head neck ( SCCHN ) tumor , particularly associate human papillomavirus ( HPV ) infection . Based internal analysis perform AstraZeneca ( AZ ) , report approximately 25 % case SCCHN express PD-L1 . Tumoral PD-L1 expression status correlate closely response anti-PD-1/anti PD-L1 antibody Durvalumab ( MEDI4736 ) immunoglobulin G1 kappa monoclonal antibody high affinity selectivity PD-L1 binding PD-L2 , development treatment patient recurrent metastatic SCCHN . This non-interventional study ( NIS ) aim generate provide data prognostic value PD-L1 status patient recurrent/metastatic SCCHN . Objectives Hypotheses : Primary objective : To determine prognostic value PD-L1 status term overall survival ( OS ) patient recurrent/metastatic SCCHN . Overall survival diagnosis recurrent/metastatic SCCHN assess PD-L1 positive PD-L1 negative patient predefined sub-groups ( e.g. , HPV status , HIV status , smoke history , heavy alcohol use , anatomical sub-site primary tumor , prior exposure radiation therapy ) . Secondary objective : Secondary objective perform follow ) patient meet eligibility criterion , b ) patient per availability tumor sample ( available , available setting ) , c ) patient available tumor sample time , time first line therapy , second line therapy per PD-L1 status ( positive , negative , unknown/not do ) : 1 . To describe relevant demographic clinical characteristic patient , stratify PD-L1 status 2 . To describe first line treatment choice , available , subsequent treatment choice 3 . To describe investigator-assessed tumor response first line second line therapy ( ) , include : best response , duration response applicable , objective response rate ( ORR ) 4 . To describe investigator-assessed progression-free survival ( PFS ) first line second line therapy ( ) . Exploratory objective : 1 . To perform additional biomarker research tumor sample ( depend tissue availability volume ) . 2 . If feasible , assess agreement PD-L1 status sample obtain different time point ( e.g. , chemotherapy radiation therapy ) . Methods : Study design : This retrospective international , multi-center , non-interventional cohort study base use data derive establish medical record secondary analysis archival tumor sample . The study collect data patient tumor characteristic , PD-L1 status , pattern treatment , clinical outcome , 600 adult patient recurrent/metastatic SCCHN . For patient selection , date diagnosis recurrent/metastatic disease use index date . The patient selection period extend 1st March 2011 30th June 2015 . This allow inclusion patient tumor sample approximately ≤ 5 year age , ensure approximately 10 month follow-up living patient recruit last day enrolment window . All patient diagnosis recurrent/metastatic squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) oral cavity ( tongue , gum , floor mouth , other/unspecified part mouth ) , oropharynx , hypopharynx , larynx period consider inclusion study . Patients identify followed medical record death end data collection ( approximately Q4 2016 ) . Patients ' demographic clinical characteristic , medical history describe . Clinical outcome include PFS , best response , duration response , ORR describe first second line therapy ( ) , OS collect . A mandatory archived tumor sample use determine PD-L1 status . If patient one suitable tissue sample , recent sample use mandatory tissue sample . Where available , additional tumor sample obtain time point disease also collect ( optional ) . Statistical analysis perform whole cohort , per PD-L1 status predefined subgroup . Data Source ( ) : The study implement total approximately 20 site US , Asia Europe . Data abstract patient 's hospital medical record death , end data collection . Archival tumor sample retrieve tested immunohistochemistry assess PD-L1 status tumor . Where sufficient tissue quantity , expression biomarkers also evaluate . Study Population : Unselected patient population representative patient may receive MEDI4736 real life set . Exposure ( ) : The primary variable PD-L1 status ( positive negative ) overall patient population . Archived tissue sample , include sample primary site , lymph node distant metastatic site , use determine PD-L1 status . PD-L1 status determine immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) use validate assay . Outcome ( ) : Overall survival assess . Additionally , follow clinical outcome describe first line second line treatment recurrent and/or metastatic disease : investigator-assessed best tumor response , duration response applicable , investigator-assessed PFS . ORR ( sum complete partial response ) derive investigator-assessed best response describe first line second line therapy ( ) . Patient characteristic , disease characteristic , pattern treatment capture describe . Sample Size Estimation : The primary objective study estimate prognostic value PD-L1 status term OS patient recurrent/metastatic SCCHN . The available sample size know priori driven number patient select site available tissue . However , assume PD-L1 status distribution approximately 25 % positive 75 % negative status , median OS patient 10 month , study accrue uniformly 52 month 10 month follow-up last patient enter survival time exponentially distribute , illustration hazard ratio would possible detect 80 % power ( 2-sided alpha 0.05 ) various sample size give table . HR detect Number death Number patient ( Total ) 0.3 30 40 0.4 51 68 0.5 74 112 0.6 136 196 0.7 278 396 HR : Hazard ratio These illustration take account fact binary prognostic factor interest ( PD-L1 status ) may correlate covariates hence could over-estimate power various sample size ( Bernardo et al , 2000 ) . The sample size ( number event ) require correlation assume multiplied 1/ ( 1-R2 ) account R2 &gt; 0 ( Hsieh Lavori , 2000 ) . The correlation currently know . Additionally , proportion patient PD-L1 status available . Given uncertainty , sample size 600 patient felt adequate . Statistical Analysis : Descriptive analysis patient characteristic , treatment choice treatment outcomes conduct . Time event data ( OS , PFS ) include rate affect patient assessed describe use Kaplan-Meier method . Two-sided 95 % CIs provide main statistical estimator . OS PD-L1 status describe subgroup , include limited following : - Per anatomical sub-site primary tumor - Per HPV status - Per HIV status - Per smoke history - Per alcohol consumption history - Per prior exposure radiation therapy - Per type treatment regimen - By performance status diagnosis recurrent/metastatic disease . The prognostic value PD-L1 status investigate use Cox proportional hazard model . Additional covariates include model describe statistical analysis plan .</detailed_description>
