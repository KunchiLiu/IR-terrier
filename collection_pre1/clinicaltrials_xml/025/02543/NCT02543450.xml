	<brief_summary>In hemiplegic stroke patient , gait performance affect impaired walking endurance . Evidence show high exercise intensity improve cardiovascular fitness , great dose task repetition benefit locomotor function . Therefore , goal study examine effect combine cardiovascular/task-oriented interval training programme walk capacity chronic stroke individual improvement participation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Physiotherapy Order Improve Walking Capacity Participation Chronic Stroke Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Owing high prevalence disability stroke old adult , walk capacity participation severely affect . According International Classification Functioning , Disability Health 2001 , participation involve function life . In Rehabilitation Medicine , grow concern way ass success treatment . However , appraisal participation stroke research scarce . In stage stroke , Physiotherapy intervention favor intensive high repetitive task-oriented task-specific training obtain benefit trained action activity . But , effect type treatment impact disease patientÂ´s participation investigate . The aim study determine kind physiotherapy task-oriented training program could better improve participation chronic stroke subject : upper limb strength training program ( ULST ) combine cardiovascular/task-oriented interval training ( IT ) program . Therefore , goal study examine effect combine cardiovascular/task-oriented interval training programme walk capacity chronic stroke individual improvement participation . A randomized single-blind control trial carried . Fourteen subject chronic hemiplegia result stroke ( onset &gt; 6m ) recruit . All participant fully inform experimental procedure aim study . Written inform consent sign subject prior participate . Approval ethic committee University Valencia obtain study . Subjects randomly allocate ULST program elastic band ( n=7 ) cardiovascular/task-oriented IT program ( n=7 ) , focus walk capacity . In ULST group , nine 5-minute station circuit session design . Patients work 2+2 minute exercise , 30-second rest 2-minute period station . The IT program consist set 8 cardiovascular exercise moderate intensity , interrupt 1-minute active break task-oriented exercise . Duration program 3 month ( 3 sessions/week ) . Participation assess Stroke Impact Scale ( SIS-16 ) Frenchay Activities Index ( FAI ) , intervention .</detailed_description>
