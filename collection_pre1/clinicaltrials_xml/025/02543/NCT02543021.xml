	<brief_summary>Patients colitis require regular 'surveillance ' colonoscopy risk develop colon cancer least 2.5 time general population . However , cancer colitis develop flat lesion call dysplasia , easily miss routine colonoscopy . As result NICE guideline colitis surveillance recommend use technique call chromoendoscopy ( CE ) water-soluble blue dye spray colonoscope coat highlight line bowel , make dysplasia easy see . Although CE accept best practice surveillance time-consuming , technically difficult require expertise interpret appearance . For reason , use widespread vast majority patient still receive inferior 'routine ' colonoscopy without CE . New technology mean video image obtain colonoscopy digitally enhance coloured press button - term virtual chromoendoscopy ( VCE ) . This could make surveillance colonoscopy shorter , comfortable cleaner ( result 'dignified ' experience ) well cheap less technically difficult . The main objective explore feasibility study ( large trial ) inform PPI meeting , place ability detect dysplasia equal importance participant 's experience procedure term speed , comfort dignity . This primarily feasibility study assess patient experience , recruitment retention rate investigator ' specify trial design , support development large crossover trial compare VCE CE surveillance colonoscopy colitis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In recruitment period , 60 patient approach invited attend schedule surveillance colonoscopy . Eligible patient ( 18-75 yr ) agree participate randomise undergo CE VCE first procedure . Data capture Observer use bespoke Access-based program . The site number biopsy sample take recorded alongside Endoscopist 's prediction , base visual appearance , whether think area biopsied actually dysplasia . After agree interval ( 8 week , usually 3-6 ) , participant undergo second colonoscopy second technique , perform Endoscopist blind result first test , data capture . For procedure , questionnaire assess immediate patient experience administer Endoscopy department , participant recover procedure . Participants also give second questionnaire assess overall experience take home complete 48 hour procedure , return post .</detailed_description>
