	<brief_summary>Background : Studies show rare genetic variant might lead disease . Researchers want collect blood tissue sample study good understand disease . Objective : To collect blood tissue sample study identify underlying cause disease . Eligibility : People age Design : Participants blood and/or tissue sample collect . Samples collect NIH Clinical Center . Participants doctor collect sample send NIH . NIH staff collect sample site . For blood sample , blood take arm vein use needle . Tissue collection may involve : Buccal smear : Cells collect scrap inside cheek cotton swab . Saliva collection : Participants spit cup . Skin biopsy : A special needle take small skin sample . Surgical waste tissue : If participant surgery , NIH may receive sample tissue would routinely remove . Umbilical cord cord blood collection : If participant baby , NIH may receive small piece umbilical cord blood cord baby deliver .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Human Biospecimen Procurement Protocol : Biorepository Support Translational Research Identify Disease Mechanism ( )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The diversity human research program NIH provide unique opportunity study different patient population monogenetic undiagnosed disease . Patient population mutation almost every major signal pathway relevant research actively investigate NIH Clinical Center . The purpose protocol establish repository biospecimens affect unaffected cohort ( reference biospecimens ) identify underlie disease mechanism ( ) . The collection consist biospecimens obtain participant consent protocol also provide continued storage analysis biospecimens previously obtain NIH IRB- approve protocol NIH protocol near completion . The biospecimens collect protocol include blood ( plasma , serum , peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) , saliva , buccal mucosa , urine , skin biopsy . Additional biospecimens collect protocol may also transfer protocol , include , tissue fluid aspirate ( cerebrospinal fluid , ascites , etc . ) , bone marrow , urine , saliva , skin biopsy , surgical tissue waste , malignant non-malignant tissue sample , and/or direct derivative human tissue ( DNA , RNA , induce pluripotent stem cell ) . Post-delivery umbilical cord core blood cord tissue waste collect time delivery protocol and/or share obtained protocol . Biospecimens may also obtain share sample clinically indicate procedure do inside outside NIH , provide subject consent protocol . The primary objective protocol create robust resource support basic translational research provide mechanism collect , track , store , dispense , analyze , dispose laboratory research sample affect unaffected cohort . This biorepository advance high-quality research area genetics personalized medicine As treatment protocol , primary endpoint . Research study include , limited , genomic study , primary cell isolation cell culture study molecular biochemical analysis , immunohistological analysis , generation patient-specific vitro disease model ( IPSCs ) , etc . As science continuously evolve field , technological advance research method incorporate research study accordingly .</detailed_description>
