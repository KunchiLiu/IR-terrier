	<brief_summary>The purpose study well understand adaptive cardiac resynchronization therapy ( aCRT ) might benefit patient . aCRT work sometimes give stimulation leave side heart , rather side , depend sens heart functioning . CRT without adaptive algorithm work give stimulation side heart . aCRT already approve FDA use patient , clear patient use compare normal CRT . This study include patient already schedule get CRT device . The investigator randomize patient aCRT study arm CRT study arm . After 6 month , investigator assess electrical activity patient ' heart . After time , patient doctor able decide would like change type CRT designate .</brief_summary>
