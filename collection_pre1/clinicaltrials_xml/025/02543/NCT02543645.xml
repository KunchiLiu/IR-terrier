	<brief_title>A Study Varlilumab Atezolizumab Patients With Advanced Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Varlilumab fully human monoclonal antibody bind molecule call CD27 find certain immune cell may act promote anti-tumor effect . Atezolizumab engineer anti-PD-L1 antibody . This study evaluate safety , tolerability efficacy anti-CD27 antibody varlilumab combination atezolizumab . Eligible patient enroll dose escalation portion study assign one three dose level varlilumab combination 1200 mg atezolizumab . The first phase study enroll 18 patient test safety profile combination varlilumab atezolizumab patient various tumor type determine dose varlilumab study Phase study enroll patient RCC . During Phase , 37 patient enrol receive recommended Phase dose varlilumab combination atezolizumab 1200 mg. All patient enrol study closely monitor determine response treatment well side effect may occur .</detailed_description>
