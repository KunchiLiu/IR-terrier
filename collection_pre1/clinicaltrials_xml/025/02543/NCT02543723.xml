	<brief_summary>Oral chemotherapeutic agent ( OCAs ) increasingly use alternative traditional intravenous chemotherapy , factor promote trend include increase survival time require long-term therapy , acceptability among patient , convenience , cost saving due reduce hospital time . Although OCAs commonly prefer patient , adherence medication vary . Suboptimal medication adherence lead loss treatment efficacy , increased toxicity , increase health care cost . Thus , critical develop test intervention effectively improve adherence OCAs . Although medication adherence literature criticize methodological issue , component intervention promise result adherence electronic monitor adherence feedback , cognitive-education , nurse-based intervention , technology-based telehealth strategy . The investigator propose unify component effective approach novel way ass efficacy feasibility two telehealth-based strategy ( electronic medication-event monitoring feedback tailor nurse coach include cognitive-education ) effort increase OCA adherence among cancer patient high-risk non-adherence rural eastern North Carolina .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : To test effectiveness two telehealth adherence motivation strategy among cancer patient oral chemotherapeutic agent high-risk non-adherence . The investigator propose randomize multi-arm intervention study 150 subject two intervention arm control arm ( 50 subject per arm ) . The Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills Model Adherence result specific aim 1 guide aim . Intervention Arm 1 receive Medication Event Monitoring System ( MEMS ) feedback . Intervention Arm 2 receive MEMS plus tailored nurse coaching component . Controls receive standard-of-care Cancer Center . Specifically , investigator want test whether tailored nurse coach intervention component significantly improve medication adherence high rate compare MEMS alone . The MEMS medication bottle cap equip microchip register date time cap opening ( dose history ) . Currently , gold standard measure medication adherence MEMS device demonstrate valid objective method assess medication adherence . The nurse coach intervention component involve individualized barriers/facilitators screen tool regular contact cancer patient via telephone call across six-month period . The investigator hypothesize although telehealth strategy effective increase medication adherence , Arm 2 significantly great effect adherence . This hypothesis support exist medication adherence literature suggest tailor intervention use multiple adherence strategy potentially significant impact increase medication adherence .</detailed_description>
