	<detailed_description>The study design investigate feasibility use applied support ( Angioshield ) saphenous vein use Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery . It feasibility determine safety prior launch large pivotal study . The primary endpoint , 30-day safety , assess record report adverse event surgery throughout investigation 30-day follow-up visit . The secondary endpoint , long term safety patency , assess record report adverse event graft patency ( via serial CT angiogram ) 30 , 90 , 365 day follow-up visit .</detailed_description>
