	<brief_summary>Objectives : This quasi-experimental pre-post-study investigated effect newly develop Nurse-led Patient Pathways ( NPP ) design improve patient ` , health care professional ` well institutional outcome . Intervention : In IG patient care three newly develop NPP . NPP characterize four principle : evidence-based nursing , patient family center care , comprehensive discharge plan beyond hospital discharge nurse ' responsibility patient ` process . The principle support strengthen patient family preference well formalize nursing activity , therefore contribute process transparency relation health care professional . Outcomes : Primary Outcomes define quality nursing care ( nurse care index , NCI ) , patient satisfaction ( patient satisfaction nursing care quality , PSNCQ ) . Secondary outcome define 1 ) nursing work environment ( nurse work index revise , NWI-R ; nurse workplace quality , NWQ ) , 2 ) institutional-related cost ( length hospital stay , LOS ; nursing time nursing cost ) . Additionally , nurse ` health care professional ` experience intervention translation explore .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In Switzerland , hospitalization rate patient musculoskeletal disorder increase within last decade . For example , recent data show Switzerland high rate hip replacement surgery Europe . Due introduction diagnosis relate group Switzerland , increase pressure reduce length hospital stay increase economic efficiency . To achieve require economic efficiency , trend towards standardization care delivery process , often form care pathway . The European Pathway Association define care pathway complex intervention . Pathways incorporate evidence base care , best practice patient expectation . As , care pathway depend communication coordination team member , patient family , well defined role sequence activity . However , care pathway often criticize organization-driven focus , lack patient center perspective miss holistic approach care . Therefore , Balgrist University Hospital Zurich University Applied Sciences develop NPP enhance patient ` , health care professional ` well institutional outcome . Method : A quasi-experimental prospective study pre-post sample design conduct . Usual care give control group ( Pre ) compare group patient assign NPP ( Post ) . The study conduct two large orthopedic unit Balgrist University Hospital , highly specialized center musculoskeletal care , locate Canton Zurich . 1 . A convenience sample recruit , consist 558 surgical patient hospitalize total hip arthroplasty , exploration decompression spinal cord , rotator cuff reconstruction . Demographic , clinical data well data measure quality nursing care , patient satisfaction , cost obtain , 2 . A sample 38 nurse recruit , work two unit . Demographic data data measure nursing work environment contain , 3 . Additionally , sample 6 nurse 5 health care professional ` ( directly involve patient care ) recruit explore experience intervention translation within 2 focus group session . The quantitative data analysis perform use statistical test appropriate sample size , measurement level , distribution independence variable . For group control appropriate test independent group use respect provision necessary assumption . Statistically significance set Alpha .05 undirected hypothesis testing , necessary correction multiple test include . Qualitative data analysis perform use content analysis . We hypothesize NPP-group ( post ) experience high quality nurse care increase patient satisfaction , without increase health care cost . Secondary outcome enhance work environment nurse .</detailed_description>
