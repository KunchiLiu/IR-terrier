	<brief_summary>Allergen challenge facility utilize many year clinical drug trial study onset action , proof concept , duration action , efficacy . Each facility somewhat different design characteristic pollen dispersal technology . Facilities locate disparate geographic area population participant sensitize allergen unique area . Therefore , facility operate single site little effort evaluate facility comparability attempt standardization across facility . The purpose study compare two site ass whether site able achieve similar symptom score .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>When CACF design high degree rigor , quality assurance validation testing , exposure control level pollen facility Environmental Exposure Unit ( EEU ) Biogenics Research Chamber ( BRC ) demonstrate comparable/standardized symptomatic response . This demonstrable follow pollen exposure also similar reduction symptom follow treatment Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve medication know effective treatment seasonal allergic rhinoconjunctivitis ( SAR ) ; cetirizine 10mg . Because quality assurance validation test complete facility priori , comparability demonstrate despite disparate geographical physical location utilization facility somewhat different mechanical technical material method achieve similar outcome . This multi-center study SAR enroll 50 participant site . These participant age 18-65 , male female , mixture ethnic group . The study involve 3 Phases : Screening , Treatment Exposure Visit , cross-over Treatment Exposure Visit . In stage , CACF visit pivotal determine participant eligibility enrollment response therapy . The qualify participant receive double-blinded , placebo-controlled , crossover intervention cetirizine HCl 10mg . All participant give write informed consent prior study related procedure perform . Participants meet inclusion/exclusion criterion screen process ask return EEU first pollen exposure visit ( Treatment Visit # 1 ) . At Screening Visit participant provide full medical history undergo physical examination . They height/weight vitals measure skin testing perform confirm allergic response panel common aeroallergens . Women child bear potential undergo urine pregnancy test rule pregnancy . Eligible participant invite back research centre 4 pollen exposure visit 2 visit participant receive either cetirizine placebo . All participant receive placebo point throughout study .</detailed_description>
