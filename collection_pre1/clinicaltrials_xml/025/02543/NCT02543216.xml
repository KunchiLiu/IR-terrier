	<brief_summary>Interactions gene environment , likely crucial development common disease type 2 diabetes . It recently show FADS1 FADS 2 genotype strong gene genome-wide analysis regulate serum fatty acid profile.The aim study test subject CC TT genotypes FADS1 gene ( rs174547 ) respond differentially diet supplement linoleic acid ( substrate FADS ) . We hypothesize subject TT genotype active desaturases sensitive dietary modification lead robust difference serum FA profile , tissue inflammation serum lipid .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Lean overweight subject ( BMI &gt; 20kg/m2 &lt; 29kg/m2 ) CC TT genotypes FADS1 polymorphism ( rs174547 ) recruit METSIM study ( METabolic Syndrome Men , currently &gt; 10000 men include population live Kuopio ) . The potential participant ask contact study nurse willing participate . Twenty six subject CC genotype select match thirty six subject TT genotype age , BMI medication . Study diet isocaloric follow habitual diet participant supplement 30-50 ml ( 25-45 g ) sunflower oil daily depend body weight . Thus , approximately 16-28 g ( 6 E % ) LA daily provide top average intake approximately 10-12 g ( 4.5 E % ) . This dose sunflower oil know cause side effect adverse event even high dos safe . Food record collect beginning ( 4 day ) third week study ( 7 day ) estimate daily intake macronutrients specifically different fatty acid .</detailed_description>
