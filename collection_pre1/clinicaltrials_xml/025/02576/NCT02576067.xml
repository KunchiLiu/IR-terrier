	<brief_summary>Vascular inflammation , central feature atherosclerosis , participate initiation , perpetuation instability plaque . Multiple clinical trial cholesterol lower therapy statin demonstrate reduction atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) event associate reduction LDL cholesterol ( LDL-C ) systemic inflammatory mediator C-reactive protein ( CRP ) . The Cardiovascular Inflammation Reduction Trial ( CIRT ) investigate anti-inflammatory agent commonly use rheumatoid arthritis ( low dose methotrexate ( LDM ) ) reduce CV morbidity mortality among patient prior myocardial infarction angiographically demonstrate multivessel coronary artery disease ( GCO # 13-1467 ) . In ancillary CIRT imaging study , investigator propose use well validated approach non-invasive serial FDG-PET/CT imaging subset patient enrol main CIRT trial directly visualize vascular inflammation . Once subject enrol main CIRT trial , baseline image do follow image do approximately 8 month baseline image . 18FDG-PET image data acquire , analyze centrally result incorporate main CIRT database . The investigator hypothesize LDM treatment result significant decrease plaque inflammation measure 18-FDG-PET/CT 8 month compare placebo .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The NHLBI fund ( Ridker 5U01HL101422 ) Cardiovascular Inflammation Reduction Trial ( CIRT ) provide unique opportunity investigate whether commonly use anti-inflammatory agent use rheumatoid arthritis ( low dose methotrexate ( LDM ) ) reduce CVD morbidity mortality among patient stable coronary artery disease . CIRT , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , multi-center trial among 7,000 men woman prior myocardial infarction angiographically demonstrate multivessel coronary artery disease . Eligible participant randomly allocate three four year period usual care plus placebo usual care plus LDM ( average dose 15-20 mg po/weekly . CIRT propose reduction CVD event methotrexate derives effect vascular inflammation , thus crucial incorporate measure vascular inflammation image confirmation primary mechanism action underlie CIRT . As , direct evaluation arterial inflammation would enhance scientific value CIRT trial . The inclusion propose vascular inflammation image substudy widespread implication allow image modality serve surrogate measure disease , thereby provide opportunity stratification individual risk CVD evaluation intervention presume anti-inflammatory effect .</detailed_description>
