	<detailed_description>Each subject undergo screening period 5 week , treatment period 2 week PK sample collection , extension treatment period 48 week , allow subject access apremilast treatment medically appropriate ( follow completion 2 week PK portion ) . Regardless stop treatment , subject complete two post treatment follow-up visit approximately 4 8 week last dose . All subject complete final follow-up visit Week 102 timepoint 52 week last dose apremilast take subject withdrawn time prior Week 50 . At least 32 subject enrol study provide adequate PK profile safety assessment subject different age body weight range . Subjects divide 2 age group ( adolescent [ age 12 17 year , inclusive ] child [ age 6 11 year , inclusive ] ) , least 16 subject group . Apremilast treatment start old heavy subject . Group 1 ( age 12 17 year , inclusive ; weight ≥ 35 kg ) - The data collect first 8 subject review independent data monitoring committee ( DMC ) determine appropriate proceed dose balance Group 1 subject proceed dose Group 2 subject . evaluation data DMC complete . Group 2 ( age 6 11 year , inclusive ; weight ≥ 15 kg ) - The dose regimen ( dose strength and/or dose frequency ) first 8 subject base upon PK safety assessment first 8 subject Group 1 . - For remain subject Group 2 , dose ( dose strength and/or dose frequency ) base upon subject weight determine PK safety assessment . The dose strength and/or dose frequency adjust safety concern unexpected change exposure . In event dose regimen adjustment second PK safety assessment , first 8 subject Group 2 return site appropriate dosing adjustment .</detailed_description>
