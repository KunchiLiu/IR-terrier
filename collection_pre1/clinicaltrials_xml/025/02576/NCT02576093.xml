	<brief_summary>Purpose study local tolerability systemic safety novel k-opioid receptor agonist proven inhibit inflammation pruritus preclinical model dermatitis . Three concentration WOL071-007 placebo apply patient AD first-in-human , single-center , combine single/multiple ascend dose ( SAD/MAD ) , double-blind , placebo-controlled , half-side comparison ( MAD part ) study . The IMP apply occlusively lesional non-lesional skin . In SAD part 24 subject receive IMP 2 day . In MAD part , 30 hospitalize subject receive IMP 6 day . Study objectives safety tolerability well ( MAD part ) pharmacokinetics efficacy WOL071-007 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Three concentration Investigational Medicinal Product ( IMP ) WOL071-007 ( = active IMP ) placebo apply patient clinical diagnosis atopic dermatitis screen Investigator 's Global Dermatitis Assessment ( IGADA ) score 1 2 ( mild moderate ) and/or local SCORing Atopic Dermatitis ( SCORAD ) ≤12 . Each dose level cohort begin 2 sentinel patient : 1 patient randomize receive active IMP patient randomize receive placebo . From remain patient 1 patient randomize receive placebo . In Single Ascending Dose ( SAD ) part study active IMP placebo apply defined surface area ≤ 100 cm² non-lesional skin ( Day 1 ) lesional skin ( Day 2 ) 22 hour patient remain study center least 6 hour dose . In Multiple Ascending Dose ( MAD ) part placebo test product + placebo ( half-side comparison ) administer 24 hour achieve define surface area approximately 2000 cm² total ( 10 % Body Surface Area ) dose level cohort . A Data Safety Monitoring Board review data recommend continuation follow dose level cohort . Primary criterion evaluation safety assessment , e.g . Adverse Event ( AE ) recording , assessment local tolerability ( score local symptom ) well systemic tolerability ( e.g . blood test neurological examination ) WOL071-007 . In MAD part additionally pharmacokinetics measure secondary parameter local efficacy .</detailed_description>
