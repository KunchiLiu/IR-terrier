	<detailed_description>This phase II signal-searching study range tumor type potential identify novel tumor indication combination therapy olaparib subsequently explore dedicated study . Patients enrol study base molecular marker genetic profiling perform tumor prior study entry ( outside protocol ) . The trial also identify genetic determinant response resistance . Patients tumor harbor mutation DNA damage repair gene treat olaparib . Patients tumor harbor either TP53 KRAS mutation mutation KRAS TP53 treat AZD1775 plus olaparib . Patients tumor harbor PIK3CA , AKT , ARID1A mutation molecular aberration lead dysregulation PI3K/AKT pathway treat AZD5363 plus olaparib . Patients tumor harbor mutation TORC1/2 TSC1/2 LKB1 mutation PTEN-deficient ( determine either genetic mutation IHC ) treat AZD2014 plus olaparib .</detailed_description>
