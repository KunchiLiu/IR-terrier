	<brief_summary>Stroke lead cause death disability , 15 million people suffer stroke year ; one-third die one-third leave permanently disable . Because risk stroke increase age , consider disease elderly , stroke also occur middle-aged people . Thrombolysis tissue plasminogen activator ( tPA ) prefer choice reperfusion therapy ischemic stroke perform within 4.5 hour symptom onset . Time thrombolysis associate improved outcome : sooner treatment , less risk serious - possibly permanent - damage brain . Unfortunately , small fraction stroke patient make thrombolysis within 4.5-hour ; one explanation may system delay include prolonged transportation . In May 2010 , first physician-staffed Helicopter Emergency Medical Service ( HEMS ) implement Eastern part Denmark . An observational study evaluate short-term effect HEMS implementation compare patient transported conventional ground ambulance ( Ground Emergency Medical Service ( GEMS ) ) patient transport HEMS . Patients transported helicopter increase time specialize care . However , 30-day 1-year mortality slightly low patient transported HEMS , although significant , degree disability three month measure modified Rankin Scale ( mRS ) .</brief_summary>
