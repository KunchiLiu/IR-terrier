	<brief_title>The Role Melanocyte Basal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Melanocytes highly specialized dendritic cell perform multiple function autocrine , paracrine endocrine mechanism . These cell part complex system intercellular communication along keratinocytes , Langerhans cell fibroblasts . This intricate network cellular communication possible thanks interaction cytokine , growth factor neurotransmitter . Although melanocyte perform brilliantly immunoregulatory neuroendocrine function , fundamental role offer protection harmful effect UV radiation production transference melanin keratinocytes , process well know melanogenesis . The latter require 3 basic protein ensure photoprotection : MC1R ( activation ) , MITF ( traduction ) TYR ( melanin synthesis ) . If one main feature melanocytes avoid UV radiation injurious effect , thus raise many question regard possible relation cell skin cancer . Currently great number melanocytic alteration describe melanoma ; however non-melanoma skin cancer role melanocytes less clear . Basal cell carcinoma ( BCC ) frequent neoplasia worldwide . There 30 histopathologic subtypes , however nodular subtype common . Pigmented variety common darker skin type , therefore country . Previous study show increase number size melanocyte . Melanogenesis increase expense hyperfunctioning melanocyte well . In experience noticed clinical course regard pigment nodular basal cell carcinoma benign compare without pigment . Most study regard role melanocyte pigmentation basal cell carcinoma conduct caucasian population , therefore representative may occur mestizo population . The aim study describe characteristic melanocyte pigment non-pigmented variant basal cell carcinoma . Quantify expression melanocytic maturation : transcription factor ( SOX9 SOX10 ) , focal adhesion kinase ( FAK125 ) receptor tyrosine kinase ( c-KIT ) melanogenesis melanocortin 1 receptor ( MC1R ) , microphthalmia-associated transcription factor ( MITF ) tyrosinase ( TYR ) marker . Investigate tumoral microenvironment quantification melanin , mast cell , angiogenesis solar elastosis .</detailed_description>
