	<detailed_description>The overall goal exploit motor learn principle novel way enhance dysphagia rehabilitation patient dysphagia due stroke . Dysphagia swallow impairment lead serious illness death due ingest material enter trachea ( aspiration ) . Specifically , study determine whether last behavioral modification swallow training occur motor learn principle versus standard care . Motor learn principle emphasize continual kinematic assessment biofeedback training . However , continual kinematic assessment rare standard dysphagia care swallow kinematics require instrumentation videofluoroscopy ( VF ) see . Since VF involve radiation exposure high cost , submental electromyography ( sEMG ) widely use biofeedback , although image swallow kinematics confirm therapeutic movement train . This research study compare three form biofeedback train swallow maneuver call volitional laryngeal vestibule closure ( vLVC ) , emphasize swallow airway protection . VF biofeedback training provide kinematic information vLVC performance , incorporate motor learn principle . sEMG biofeedback training provide non-kinematic information vLVC performance , thus , incorporate motor learn principle . A mixed biofeedback training , involve VF biofeedback early establish target kinematics vLVC maneuver , reinforces learn sEMG . Mixed biofeedback training examine clinically feasible VF biofeedback training , still incorporate motor learn principle part vLVC training . The investigator hypothesize VF training reduce swallow impairment mixed training , mixed training reduce swallow impairment sEMG training . Additionally , study investigate whether adjuvant technique know augment motor training ( non-invasive neural stimulation explicit reward test independently ) , augment outcome propose training 's . This innovative experimental design significant investigate motor learn principle within ideal training ( VF biofeedback ) well within clinically feasible option ( mixed biofeedback ) differentiate standard dysphagia training ( sEMG ) , report little improvement intense motor training .</detailed_description>
