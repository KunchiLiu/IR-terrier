	<brief_summary>To include patient traumatic ( calcaneal ) fracture study . They include analyze gait OFM foot model , non invasis model . Patient invite movement laboratory MUMC . Markers detach dubble sided tape anatomical point . After gait record infra-red camera 's animation model form . With model analysis make range motion different segement foot . These result compare patient arthrodesis , healthy subject , futher questionnaire , physical examination radiographic finding correlate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All subject ask come movement laboratory Maastricht University Medical Centre one individual day . Before gait analysis follow characteristic measure ; height , weight , BMI , knee ankle width ( measure two condyle knee measure two malleoli ankle ) leg length . All measurement perform researcher trained examination foot . At least one static trial perform 42 marker , subject stance phase anatomic neutral position . After calibrate marker calculate subject-specific joint ax static trial , 6 marker remove , accord OFM protocol . After subject ask walk barefoot normal speed number practice trial . For speed least 8 proper recording make walk . The healthy subject also ask walk slow speed 8 proper recording make slow-speed walking . One whole step consider complete heel landing ( initial contact ) toe-off . A force plate use determine heel-strike toe-off phase walking . Corrections ax knee ankle make necessary tile save data output .</detailed_description>
