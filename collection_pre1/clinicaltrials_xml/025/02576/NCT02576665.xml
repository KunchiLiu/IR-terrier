	<brief_summary>This multicenter , open label , single arm study Toca 511 Toca FC . Based cancer diagnosis ( brain metastasis non small cell lung cancer breast cancer ; colorectal cancer liver metastases ; metastatic renal cell carcinoma ; locally advance recurrent melanoma ; locally advance metastatic pancreatic cancer breast cancer [ ie , resectable brain metastasis ] ) subject receive Toca 511 either intravenously ( IV ) intralesionally ( IL ) . Up 6 subject enrolled disease group . In melanoma group , Toca 511 administer IV injection 3 consecutive day ( 14 mL per day ) ; melanoma group , least 3 subject may receive Toca 511 IV injection ( dose regimen 3 group ) , least 3 subject receive Toca 511 IL injection ( approximately 0.1 mL 4 mL 5 consecutive day ) . Based disease group , subject either multiple core biopsy resection metastatic lesion ( primary subject renal cell carcinoma undergo debulking nephrectomy ) , approximately 14 28 day Toca 511 administration . A portion resect biopsied tumor sample evaluate presence Toca 511 vector sequence marker disease characteristic . After recovery biopsy surgery ( approximately 4-6 week Toca 511 treatment start ) , subject begin first cycle oral Toca FC ( ie , 7 day course 220 mg/kg/day ; thereafter , cycle 7-day course Toca FC repeat approximately every 6 week ) . Toca FC may continue alone conjunction standard therapy ( investigational treatment prohibit ) . One disease group may expand allow replacement subject provide good assessment efficacy . Subjects follow safety 15 year require regulatory authority . In addition , subject follow efficacy ( objective response survival ) .</brief_summary>
