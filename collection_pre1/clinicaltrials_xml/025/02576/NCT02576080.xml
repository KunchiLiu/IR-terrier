	<brief_summary>Following ACOSOG Z9001trial , imatinib receive market authorization Europe patient GIST significant risk relapse adjuvant setting , accord classification Miettinen Joensuu . Thereafter , SSG XVIII / AI trial prove need revise recommendation European Society Medical Oncology regard optimal duration treatment , currently three year . Patients low risk recurrence receive adjuvant treatment imatinib recommendation make literature data indication adjuvant treatment patient intermediate risk relapse . The provision prognostic molecular marker group so-called intermediate-risk subject would facilitate identification responder imatinib avoid overtreating patient undertreating others would benefit Imatinib . Recently , Lagarde et al . show Genomic Index ( GI = A Â² / C , A total number alteration gain loss C number chromosome involve alteration Comparative Genomic Hybridization array ( CGH array ) ) could prognostic value GIST , particularly intermediate risk GISTs . More recent work author 100 case GISTs intermediate prognosis accord classification Miettinem identify two prognostic group base GI . The rate metastatic relapse 2 year 30.6 % group GI great 10 versus 5.4 % group GI le 10 ( manuscript preparation ) . Thus , legitimate set randomize trial study effectiveness adjuvant treatment imatinib GIST population intermediate risk relapse high GI . This study prospective randomize clinical trial : phase III , open-label , 2 parallel group , multicenter study . The primary objective study assess efficacy adjuvant Imatinib rate metastatic relapse 2 year patient intermediate-risk gastrointestinal stromal tumor present high Genomic Grade Index . The second objective study compare two therapeutic approach term metastasis-free survival 1 year , 2 year 3 year , overall survival , clinical biological tolerance , safety Quality life patient caregiver . The eligible subject must meet following criterion : subject gastrointestinal stromal tumor , intermediary risk Armed Forces Institute Pathology classification [ Miettenen 2006 ] , subject Genomic Grade Index higher 10 determined CGH array , subject surgery primary tumor perform 2 week 2 month start adjuvant Imatinib mesylate , subject evidence residual macroscopic disease surgery medical decision prescribe imatinib . Subjects meet follow criterion must enrol : subject experience spontaneous tumor rupture surgery , subject whose tumor PDGFRA D842V mutation evidence sequence tumor Block subject whose mutational status meet wild phenotype definition evidence sequence tumor Block . The Standard Group receive adjuvant imatinib dose 400 mg per day period 3 year . Patients assessed metastasis every three month three year thoraco-abdominal pelvic CT scan . The Experimental Group receive thoraco-abdominal pelvic CT scan . The estimated proportion subject relapse 2 year 30 % experimental group 2.5 % standard group : alpha risk , 5 % , power 80 % . A total 80 subject ( 40 arm ) include . This trial combine two learned society already take part many clinical trial France ( French Sarcoma Group French Digestive Cancer Federation ) . The expected benefit patient : treat subject treatment would offer little benefit weigh disadvantage treat subject treatment would provide real benefit reduce cost treatment patient would benefit treated imatinib . The originality study include molecular data therapeutic decision demonstrate concept individualize treatment patient population . This could ultimately change current recommendation .</brief_summary>
