	<brief_summary>Myocardial perfusion image efficient tool ass risk major cardiac event patient know suspected coronary artery disease . If test normal , abnormality perfusion represent le 10 % leave ventricle myocardium , patient consider low risk manage optimal medical treatment . Recently , new gamma camera use semi-conductor detector develop . Their diagnostic performance demonstrate confront various anatomical functional reference technique , coronary angiography FFR . The prognostic value normal SPECT MPI specifically assess yet . Coronary microvascular dysfunction ( CMVD ) demonstrate early marker coronary artery disease ( CAD ) . Preliminary data suggest myocardial perfusion heterogeneity ( potential surrogate marker endothelial dysfunction ) assess conventional MP-SPECT , additive independent prognostic value presence myocardial ischemia remain unknown . Accordingly , purpose study : - To assess prognostic value normal myocardial perfusion stress image use semiconductor gamma camera dual isotope high speed protocol , - To evaluate prognostic value myocardial perfusion heterogeneity assess new automatized image processing method , normal SPECT MPIs . The main hypothesis presence myocardial perfusion heterogeneity predictive cardiovascular event patient refer Nuclear Cardiology Department routine evaluation know suspected CAD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>SPECT image protocol analysis Stress test SPECTs perform accord routine protocol use center . Briefly , peak stress , patient inject thallium-201 . Five 10 minute stress , 5-minutes supine acquisition perform follow 5-minutes prone acquisition . Subsequently , technetium-99m-sestamibi inject , 2 minute later single 5-minutes rest acquisition perform . During stress acquisition , patient image supine prone position arm position head . The rest acquisition acquire supine position . The gated SPECT study perform acquisition . Injected activity ( IA ) adjust patient weight . For weight &lt; 80 kg/ 80-100 kg/ &gt; 100 kg , thallium-201 IAs 74/92/111 MBq technetium-99m-sestamibi IAs 300/370/450 MBq , respectively . A uniform imaging pre-treatment reconstruction raw myocardial perfusion image data apply , image reconstruct reoriented obtain transaxial section leave ventricle accord three standard cardiac plane . In study , use new mathematic technique entropy analysis provide precise , objective , automated quantification perfusion heterogeneity stress camera SPECT . This method may non-invasive image assess coronary microvascular dysfunction .</detailed_description>
