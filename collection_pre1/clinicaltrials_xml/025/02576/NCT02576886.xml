	<brief_summary>Participants ask participate research study participant 's doctor order myocardial perfusion SPECT ( Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography ) scan look blood flow participant heart . Myocardial perfusion image proven test look blood flow participant 's heart injection radioactive tracer . The standard test require two injection radioactive tracer take image participant 's heart rest stress test . It propose case , patient could image do stress portion test , normal , rest image would need do . In case , one injection radioactive tracer would need . It propose add another stress image make participant lying stomach , increase confidence report doctor reporting stress image . The purpose study find extra information add image participant stomach help doctor report test result .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combined Supine/Prone Acquisitions Stress-First/Stress-Only Myocardial Perfusion Imaging Reduce Equivocal Results</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Successfully implement SFSO-MPI protocol require validate pre-screening tool proven image protocol aid physician reporting study confidence . The investigator 's previous study , entitle `` The feasibility Stress-First/Stress-Only Myocardial Perfusion Imaging reduce patient radiation exposure select subset patient undergo test tertiary care facility ( SFSO-MPI ) '' , design validate pre-screening tool develop Duvall et al . In investigator 's population tool demonstrate sensitivity specificity ( 95 % CI ) 0.79 ( 0.74-0.83 ) 0.55 ( 0.48-0.62 ) ( unpublished data ) . The sensitivity lower previous publish . However investigator note great proportion participant classify abnormal ( 55 % v 31 36 % two cohort describe Duvall et al ) high number patient ( 15 % ) report equivocal stress image . These factor may affect sensitivity pre-screening tool . A great proportion investigator 's participant would require rest study proper interpretation test . Additional imaging increase patient ' radiation exposure time requirement study affect proper allocation department resource . The department routinely image patient supine position . The implementation routine combine supine/prone image expect decrease image artifact may reduce number study report equivocal . If combine supine/prone image successful change interpretation significant proportion equivocal stress study normal , need rest image obviate large group patient , result reduce radiation dose patient medical staff , good laboratory efficiency due faster throughput , reduce time commitment patient low radiopharmaceutical cost . This change practice also aid meeting American Society Nuclear Cardiology ( ASNC ) goal 9mSv patient exposure 50 % study .</detailed_description>
