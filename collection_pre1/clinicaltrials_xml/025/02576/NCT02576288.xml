	<brief_summary>Abdominal obesity major risk factor heart attack , stroke , peripheral vascular disease , dementia , cancer Type 2 diabetes . The central hypothesis proposal pro-atherogenic mediator emanate inflammation deep subcutaneous adipose tissue ( dSAT ) release systemic circulation damage arterial vasculature . The investigator postulate inflammation dSAT , quantified macrophage phenotyping/enumeration ) closely link systemic level pro-atherogenic mediator b ) tightly associate endothelial dysfunction loss central arterial elasticity , highly predictive future cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) complication . These relationship provide basis macrophage-targeted therapy reduce obesity-related inflammation impair arterial vasoreactivity . The investigator evaluate novel approach use dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor ( DPP4i ) sitagliptin , block signal transduction monocyte/macrophage activation . Thus , abdominally obese , 18-40 years-old adult without clinical CVD , show study expect show sitagliptin versus placebo : 1. significantly improve early measure arterial damage ( brachial artery endothelial dysfunction reduce carotid elasticity ) . 2. significantly attenuate inflammation dSAT local production pro-inflammatory mediator adipose tissue , associate decrease systemic pro-atherogenic mediator contribute atherogenesis . Since many obese person fail sustain weight loss lifestyle intervention include diet exercise , important public health goal identify relatively safe alternative strategy use pre-emptively `` asymptomatic '' obese person arterial dysfunction damage still reversible atherosclerosis progress serious CVD event .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>APPROACH : Overview Study Design : This double-masked , randomize , placebo-controlled pilot study treatment sitagliptin ( 100mg/day ) suppress monocyte/macrophage activation obese non-diabetic participant . 16 abdominally obese18-40 year-old largely minority randomize 3:1 receive sitagliptin ( N=12 ) match placebo ( N=4 ) daily 28 day . Eligibility Criteria Study Cohort : Based prior study conduct investigator , approximately 60-70 % participant enrol Hispanics African Americans . Both minority increase prevalence insulin resistance ( IR ) young age . In prior study , insulin resistance ( HOMA-IR* ≥3.0 ) predictive value 88 % crown like structure abdominal fat ( surrogate fat inflammation ) ; inclusion criterion IR assure study subject abdominal fat inflammation . * homeostatic method analysis-insulin resistance Inclusion Criteria 1 . Age 18-40 year age 2 . Stable weight ( change &gt; 3 % prior 6 month ) 3 . Waist circumference ≥102cm men ; ≥88cm woman 4 . Fasting plasma glucose 100-125 , HgbA1C 5.7-6.4 % HOMA-IR* ≥3.0 Exclusion Criteria : 1 . Regular use non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) ; unwilling stop NSAID drug 2 . On statin prescription anti-inflammatory drug 3 . Diabetes clinically evident cardiovascular disease 4 . Smoking daily consume &gt; 200g alcohol/day Study participant adult 18-40 year age exclude old person irreversible atherosclerosis ( e.g . calcify , stenotic plaque ) subclinical arterial thrombus release inflammatory mediator . Persons Type 2 diabetes ( myocardial infarction equivalent ) receive `` statin '' ( also potent anti-inflammatory drug ) exclude , thereby exclude participant advanced atherosclerosis . The goal identify study person abdominal obesity inflammation young age potential target population pre-emptive anti-inflammatory therapy prevent serious CVD event ensue year . Outcome Measures : 1 . Change arterial vasoreactivity measure quantified ultrasound assessment brachial artery flow mediate dilation carotid stiffness ( elasticity distensibility ) . 2 . Change measure inflammation intra-abdominal adipose tissue : 1 . M1 pro-inflammatory macrophage M2 anti-inflammatory macrophage fluorescent activate cell sort . 2 . Ex vivo secretion inflammatory mediator macrophages fraction . 3 . Change systemic pro-inflammatory/pro-atherogenic marker insulin resistance .</detailed_description>
