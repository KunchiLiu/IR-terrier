	<brief_title>Suprascapular Nerve Block Postoperative Analgesia After Artroscopic Shoulder Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postoperative pain management arthroscopic shoulder surgery traditionally include opioids and/or interscalene brachial plexus block ( IBPB ) . Opioid consumption often lead unpleasant side effect include nausea , vomitting sedation . IBPB offer efficient pain relief include discomfort paralyze arm . Furthermore approach often also lead unilateral paresis phrenic nerve cause reduce respiratory capacity . The latter offering discomfort potential risk patient lung disease heavy overweight . The suprascapular nerve important nerve shoulder selective block nerve could offer good pain relief without mentioned side effect . In randomized study investigator wish examine pain relieve effect selective block suprascapular nerve arthroscopic shoulder surgery . 40 patient randomized block nerve either active drug ( Ropivacaine ) placebo ( Saline ) . All patient get PCA ( Patient Controlled Analgesia ) pump administration i.v . morphine dos base age weight . Patient monitor 6 hour . The primary outcome reduction VAS rest baseline 30 minute nerve block .</detailed_description>
