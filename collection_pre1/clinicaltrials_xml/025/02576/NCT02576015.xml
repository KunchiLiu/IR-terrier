	<brief_summary>The interaction analgesia sedation ot effect prognosis surgical patient still need elucidated.Currently , optimize intra-operative Analgesia sedation improve prognosis surgical patient still mystery.Intra-operative nerve block provide regional analgesia operate knee , reduce dosage sedative analgesics.Based pilot study , investigator find decrease post-operative adverse composite outcome use continuous femoral nerve block ( 2 % versus 7 % ) , therefore , investigator postulate general analgesia light sedation combination peripheral nerve block could reduce post-operative morbidity compare deeper sedation.This randomize control trial design test hypothesis patient receive unilateral knee arthroplasty .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Continuous Femoral Nerve Block With Modulation Depth Anesthesia Prognosis Patients Receiving Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study approve institutional review board First Affiliated Hospital Chongqing Medical University . The protocol design accordance Consolidated Standards Reporting Trials ( CONSORT ) statement.This study design randomize control trial compare intra-operative continuous femoral nerve block combine lighter anesthetic depth ( group L ) deeper anesthetic depth ( group D ) monitor bispectral index ( BIS ) . All potentially eligible participant ask give write informed consent enrol study.The follow outcome assess : post-operative major complication ( post-operative pulmonary infection , need mechanical respiratory support , myocardio-infarction , deep venous thrombosis , pulmonary embolism , stroke , poor wound heal , all-cause post-operative death within 30 day ) .Secondary Outcomes include : acute post-operative pain assess visual analogue scale dosage rescue medication ; Dosages intra-operative vasopressor , anesthetic analgesic ; Life quality measure EQ-5D questionnaire 3 month post-operatively ; adverse event associate femoral catheter ( displacement , infection , hematoma , drop-out catheter ) .</detailed_description>
