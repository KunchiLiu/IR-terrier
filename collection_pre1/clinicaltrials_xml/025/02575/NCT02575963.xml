	<brief_summary>The study multicenter , open label Phase I/II trial . The goal Phase I part study find high tolerable dose Lintuzumab-Ac225 give cytarabine patient AML . The goal Phase II part study learn Lintuzumab-Ac225 cytarabine control AML . The safety drug combination also study . Lintuzumab-Ac225 design deliver radiation therapy directly inside leukemia cell without give radiation surround normal cell Cytarabine design insert DNA ( genetic material ) cancer cell stop DNA repairing .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Low Dose Cytarabine Lintuzumab-Ac225 Older AML Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase I , dose-escalation component : A 3+3 study design estimate maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) . Total Lintuzumab-Ac225 dose administer two equal fractionate dos . The first fraction administer administer approximately 4-7 day first ten-day cycle LDAC complete . The second fraction administer 4-7 day date first fraction . Up 4 group 6 participant enrol . Phase II , efficacy component : A 2-stage minimax design employ enroll 53 patient . Study Groups : If enrol Phase I portion , dose Lintuzumab-Ac225 receive depend join study . The first group participant receive low dose level Lintuzumab-Ac225 . Each new group receive high dose Lintuzumab-Ac225 group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose Lintuzumab-Ac225 found . If enrol Phase II portion , receive Lintuzumab-Ac225 high dose tolerate Phase I portion . All participant receive dose level cytarabine . Study Drug Administration : You receive cytarabine injection skin . This call subcutaneous injection . During first office visit , caregiver teach give injection home . You get cytarabine injection 2 time day Days 1-10 study cycle . Cycle 1 may last 52 day depend recover Lintuzumab-Ac225 . All cycle 28 day . You receive Lintuzumab-Ac225 vein 15-30 minute time point 4 7 day last dose cytarabine Cycle 1 . You receive second time 4 7 day . One ( 1 ) day second dose Lintuzumab-Ac225 , begin take lasix ( furosemide ) mouth every day 10 day . Furosemide take prevent possible damage kidney . One ( 1 ) day last dose furosemide , begin take spironolactone mouth every day 1 year . It also take prevent possible kidney damage . You give standard drug help decrease risk side effect . You may ask study staff information drug give risk Study Visits : During Cycle 1 : - Every week , blood ( 6-10 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - Every week , urine collect routine test . - About 1 week Cycle 2 , bone marrow aspirate biopsy check status disease . During Cycles 2-12 : - Every week , blood ( 6-10 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - Blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) draw find Lintuzumab-Ac225 may affect immune system ( Cycles 3 , 4 , 7 ) . - Every month , urine collect routine test . - About 1 week Cycles 3 5 , bone marrow aspirate biopsy check status disease . Length Study : You receive Lintuzumab-Ac225 first cycle , may continue receive cytarabine 12 cycle . You take study disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study complete follow-up . If stop take study drug 12 treatment cycle finish , may contact telephone see clinic every month 1 year check side effect may . This investigational study . Lintuzumab-Ac225 FDA approve commercially available . It currently use research purpose . Cytarabine FDA approve commercially available treatment AML . The use drug combination AML investigational .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Untreated AML , include patient antecedent hematologic disorder secondary disease . Patients prior MDS may receive therapy immunomodulatory agent hypomethylating agent diagnosis . Patients prior cancer diagnosis allow long measurable disease undergo active therapy , life expectancy ≥ 4 month . 2 . Patients age ≥60 year : 1 . Are unwilling receive intensive ( e.g . 7+3 ) chemotherapy , 2 . Have poorrisk prognostic factor define antecedent hematologic disorder , prior chemotherapy XRT , abnormal karyotype ( 8 ; 21 ) , inv16 , ( 16 ; 16 ) , karyotype FLT3ITD , present WBC &gt; 100K , 3 . Have significant comorbidities , judgment investigator make subject unsuitable standard dose induction chemotherapy ( e.g . anthracycline infusional cytarabine give 7+3 ) , ; 4 . Any patient age ≥ 70 year . 3 . Blast count ≥20 % 4 . Greater 25 % blast must CD33 positive . 5 . Adequate renal hepatic function 6 . ECOG ≤ 3 1 . Patients acute promyelocytic leukemia 2 . Treatment chemotherapy biologic therapy within 3 week , except hydroxyurea , must discontinue prior treatment study 3 . Treatment radiation within 6 week 4 . Active serious infection uncontrolled antibiotic 5 . Active malignancy within 2 year entry , except previously treat nonmelanoma skin cancer , carcinoma situ cervical intraepithelial neoplasia , organ confine prostate cancer evidence progressive disease base PSA level active therapy . 6 . Clinically significant cardiac pulmonary disease 7 . Active CNS leukemia . Patients symptoms CNS involvement , particularly M4 M5 subtypes , undergo lumbar puncture prior treatment study exclude CNS disease . Symptoms include cranial neuropathy , neurologic deficit , headache . 8 . Psychiatric disorder would preclude study participation</criteria>
