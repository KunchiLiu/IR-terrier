	<brief_title>Pancreaticoduodenectomy With Without Preoperative Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients diagnose premalignant malignant tumor common bile duct , periampullary duodenum screen eligibility within 4 week schedule surgery . Initiation therapy define first day HBOT patient receive HBOT therapy ( Arm A ) day surgery patient receive HBOT ( Arm B ) . Patients consider `` enrolled study '' consent form sign , screen procedure undertaken eligibility criterion meet . The fifty eligible patient randomize 1:1 ratio day screen process . The eligible subject undergo HBOT treat 2.4 Atmospheres Absolute ( ATA ) oxygen ( O2 ) , maximum 90 minute day without air break , deem necessary investigator , two day . Patients deem ineligible receive standard care without exception . The start day week commence HBOT Monday Wednesday , second final day HBOT treatment day patient undergoes pancreaticoduodenectomy . The subject complete HBOT regimen must undergo subsequent pancreaticoduodenectomy within five hour termination HBOT . If five hour delay completion HBOT commencement operation , subject consider `` study treatment '' . However , `` study treatment '' patient continue follow every six month first thirty month , annually thereafter . During postoperative period , clinical data questionnaire form collect day 1 , day 3 , day 5 , one month ( ± 2 week ) first year . As secondary objective , investigator collect clinical data patient follow visit office , contact phone , mail protocol specific questionnaires every 6 month 5 year .</detailed_description>

BMI ≥ 35 ) Renal Insufficiency Hepatic Insufficiency Another comorbidity opinion investigator make patient compromise Nutritionally deplete . Albumin level ≤ 3.5 grams/deciliter ( g/dL ) Adequate organ function define : Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500 / ( microliter ) mcL Platelets &gt; 100,000 / mcL Total bilirubin &lt; 2.5 time upper limit normal Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) / Alanine transaminase ( ALT ) &lt; 2.5 time institutional upper limit normal Creatinine within normal institutional limit OR creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min/ per CockcroftGault equation patient creatinine level institutional normal Signed informed consent History asthma . There evidence administration bronchodilator may increase incidence gas embolism brain pulmonary vasodilation . Congenital spherocytosis . Increased risk massive hemolysis . High grade fever time screening ( 38.5 degree Celsius tend low seizure threshold due oxygen toxicity may result delay relatively routine therapy Optic neuritis . Upper respiratory tract infection viral infection ( relative contraindication due difficulty patient may clear ear sinus . Pregnancy . Emphysema carbon dioxide retention . Viral infection . There controversial clinical evidence whether hyperbaric oxygen therapy ( HBOT ) helpful eliminate viral infection otherwise viral infection may considerably worsen HBOT . Cisplatin therapy ( evidence drug retard wound heal combine HBOT ) . Disulphiram therapy . Evidence suggest drug block production superoxide dismutase . This may severely affect body 's ability neutralize oxygen free radical . Doxorubicin therapy . This chemotherapeutic agent become increasingly toxic pressure . Animal study suggest least oneweek break last dose first treatment HBOT . Claustrophobia . Some degree confinement anxiety report .</criteria>
