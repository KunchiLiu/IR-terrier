	<brief_summary>In study suitability two -sequential single step- commercially available culture medium brand compare . The aim study verify whether possible improve efficiency infertility treatment couple usually high cycle cancellation rate , poor responder patient severe male infertility . The study population compose couple attend fertility clinic : purpose couple approach IVF treatment diagnosis OAT , cryptozoospermia , advance maternal age woman `` poor responder '' diagnosis recruit . IVF treatment randomly set culture either two-step sequential medium one-step medium acquire data concern ongoing embryo culture development clinical outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Influence Culture Media Clinical Outcomes Poor Responders Severe Male Infertility</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The final goal field Assisted Reproductive Technology obtain single healthy newborn . For purpose , lot factor strictly interconnect 's carefully evaluate . The choice embryo culture system embryo selection strategy play crucial role obtain identify embryo high implantation potential . One really important key factor choice culture medium . Currently , numerous commercially available culture medium show different composition . Essentially two strategy apply design culture medium : 1 ) `` Back nature '' sequential medium , base physiology embryo measure concentration substance present natural environment 2 ) `` Let embryo choose '' single step medium , none priori assumption concentration component make . In literature , lot study analyze effect culture medium human preimplantation embryo development compare biological clinical outcome among different medium composition . Several study perform comparison development human zygotes either one-step two-step culture system . Usually significant difference two culture medium system regard biological clinical outcome . Anyway , great number blastocyst generally obtain continuous single medium culture compare sequential culture medium , even implantation clinical pregnancy rate comparable .</detailed_description>
