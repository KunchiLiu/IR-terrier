The aim present trial ass safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics efficacy azithromycin ( AZI ) plus piperaquine ( PQ ) give IPTp pregnant Papua New Guinea woman . The study comprise two sub-studies : ( ) A safety , tolerability pharmacokinetic study AZI-PQ pregnancy . ( ii ) A safety , tolerability preliminary efficacy study AZI-PQ pregnancy .</brief_summary>
