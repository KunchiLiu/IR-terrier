	<brief_title>Diagnosis Pathological Complete Response Minimal Invasive Biopsy After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( NACT ) increasingly use approach patient locally advance primarily inoperable breast cancer patient potentially chemosensitive tumor . In clinical routine surgical treatment follow pre-operative chemotherapy . However , recent study demonstrate shrink tumor need less surgical treatment indicate patient pCR could potentially spar surgery future . Up , prediction pCR NACT , i.e . diagnose pCR without surgery , base tumor biology diagnosis , apply NACT regimen breast imaging result ; mediocre accuracy . This prospective , monocenter diagnostic trial aim explore minimal invasive biopsy ( MIB ) might overcome diagnostic challenge . From September 1st , 2014 February 15th , 2015 investigator perform ultrasound guide vacuum-assisted minimal invasive biopsy ( VAB ) 50 breast cancer patient NACT directly prior surgery . To analyse VAB pathologically result categorize follow : residual vital tumor cell ( invasive , situ , , lymphangiosis carcinomatosous ) present , ( significant part ) tumor bed present , neither vital tumor cell ( significant part ) tumor bed ( indicate non representative VAB ) . The result compare pathological examination surgical specimen .</detailed_description>
