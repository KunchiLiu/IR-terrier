	<brief_summary>This phase III study , open-label , randomize study investigate lenalidomide dexamethasone without biaxin subject newly diagnose , previously untreated MM . Eligible subject randomize 1:1 ratio receive regimen consist either biaxin , lenalidomide , low-dose dexamethasone ( BiRd arm ) , lenalidomide low-dose dexamethasone ( Rd arm ) . 306 patient include ( 50 % Spain ( 153 ) 50 % USA ( 153 )</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BiRd Arm Subjects BiRD arm receive clarithromycin , Revlimid ( lenalidomide ) , dexamethasone 28-day cycle . Dosing follow : - Clarithromycin 500mg PO twice daily day 1-28 28-day cycle . If dose clarithromycin miss , take soon possible day . If missed entire day , make . Vomited dos make . - Lenalidomide 25mg PO daily day 1-21 28-day cycle patient calculate creatinine clearance &gt; 60 cc/min . Patients calculate creatinine clearance &lt; 60 cc/min receive 15 mg PO daily day 1-21 28 cycle . If dose lenalidomide miss , take soon possible day . If missed entire day , make . Vomited dos make . - Dexamethasone 40mg PO give day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 28-day cycle . Missed vomited dos make . If subject tolerate oral dexamethasone , give intravenously . Rd Arm Subjects Rd arm receive Revlimid , dexamethasone 28-day cycle . Dosing follow : - Lenalidomide 25mg PO daily day 1-21 28-day cycle patient calculate creatinine clearance &gt; 60 cc/min . Patients calculate clearance &lt; 60 cc/min receive 15 mg PO daily day 1-21 a28 cycle . If dose lenalidomide miss , take soon possible day . If missed entire day , make . Vomited dos make . - Dexamethasone 40mg PO give day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 28-day cycle . Missed vomited dos make . If subject tolerate oral dexamethasone , give intravenously . Correlative study : Relative dose intensity : Projected total dose per cycle component assign drug divide actual dose receive ratio assessed cycle deliver . MRD : Minimal residual disease test perform subject achieve complete response . MRD test may perform either flow cytometry polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) , whichever readily available study institution . Subjects continue randomize treatment assignment disease progression unacceptable toxicity ( whichever occurs first ) . In case toxicity precludes dose one agent ( i.e dexamethasone , clarithromycin , lenalidomide ) , treatment regimen continue remain agent . Subjects unable receive ALL component assign treatment arm remove study reasonable attempt dose reduce manage side effect . Subjects also remove study investigator 's discretion , withdraw consent . At completion early discontinuation treatment , subject follow 30 additional day initiation subsequent treatment ( whichever occurs first ) , active treatment phase study . Long-term follow-up disease status survival proceed subject withdrawn consent , lose follow-up , die .</detailed_description>
