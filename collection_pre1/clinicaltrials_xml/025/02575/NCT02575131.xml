	<brief_summary>Rationale : The worldwide prevalence obesity increase rapidly , moment overweight underweight people world . This partly cause increased energy , food intake . One physiological factor regulate food intake pattern satiety . Though regulation food intake study quite extensively , underlie mechanism well elucidate yet still new factor involve regulation find . Therefore , study investigator aim develop vitro screen tool combine silico model prediction satiety , cost- time - effective screening satiate property new exist complex food product ( functional ) ingredient , base actual satiety score measure . A second aim Wholegrain Satiety project evaluate satiate property different type wholegrain bread oat base product , validation purpose strengthen scientific evidence health benefit wholegrain product . As part study , acute satiety score consumption various breakfast product well-controlled clinical condition compare satiety score obtain 'at home ' test condition . Objective : The current study aim compare acute satiety effect carbohydrate breakfast product .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In present study investigator conduct clinical trial standard protocol use examine five different breakfast ( different type : breakfast cereal bread , macronutrient composition ) satiate ingredient reveal actual human satiety score . The visual analogue scale use determination satiety feeling accept method EFSA study extensively . It use TNO earlier carbohydrate contain breakfast experiment . Subjects may feel eat differently home . Especially since supervision researcher know influence behavior participant . Self-measuring potential give reliable estimate intervention effect . Therefore , interest repeat test perform clinical unit , 'at home ' condition , place consumer eat breakfast habitually ( = ecological validity ) . Study design : The study design open , randomize , control , cross-over trial . Study population : Forty healthy , lean overweight , non-restrained eating woman . Intervention : The intervention consist five different normal breakfast ( normal amount , 243-355 kCal ; bread , cook oatmeal , cereal meal , fry egg bread ) provide breakfast metabolic ward home . Main study parameters/endpoints : Satiety score obtain visual analogue rating scale ( VAS ) . Subjects rate hunger feeling , fullness feeling , satiety feeling , desire eat rate prospective food consumption , multiple time consumption breakfast . A test session last four hour ( = 0 , 15 , 30 , 45 , 60 , 90 , 120 , 150 , 180 , 210 240 minute ) . In controlled condition TNO , finger prick perform = 0 , 30 , 60 , 90 120 minute breakfast consumption measure blood glucose . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : Subjects consume prescribe , standardize breakfast product ; five time clinical unit five time home . No risk associate intake test product . The VAS questionnaire fill laptop multiple time test day ( home clinic ) . No risk real burden concern study . Subjects perform finger prick five time control session TNO , know minimally invasive technique obtain drops blood .</detailed_description>
