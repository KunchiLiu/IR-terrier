	<brief_title>Terameprocol Treating Patients With Recurrent High Grade Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) terameprocol give orally day 1-5 every 28 day patient high grade glioma . ( Part 1 ) II . To evaluate terameprocol tumor plasma ratio resect high grade glioma follow 5 day oral terameprocol administration . ( Part 2 ) III . To assess maximum duration terameprocol safely administer continuous basis . ( Part 3 ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Characterize plasma pharmacokinetic ( PK ) oral terameprocol . II . Evaluate toxicities oral terameprocol . III . Assess progression-free survival . IV . Estimate overall survival . V. Assess tumor response . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess contribution cytochrome P450 , family 2 , subfamily C , polypeptide 9 ( CYP2C9 ) genotypes variability oral terameprocol pharmacokinetics . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive terameprocol orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-5 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day , every 2 month 2 year , every 6 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
