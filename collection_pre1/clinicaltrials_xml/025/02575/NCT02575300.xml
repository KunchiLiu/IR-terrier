	<brief_summary>This prospective phase II open-label trial , stratify patient equally two cohort consist carcinoid tumor pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor ( pNETs ) . The purpose study test good bad effect study drug call Ibrutinib . The study population consist adult patient histologically confirm low intermediate grade NETs GI tract , lung unknown primary ( carcinoid tumor ) pNETs . All patient must confirm advanced disease . The study enroll 51 patient two cohort ( 30 carcinoid 21 pNET patient ) .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Locally unresectable metastatic carcinoid pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor ( pNETs ) Measureable disease Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) Tumors must histologically cytologically proven consider low intermediate grade . Patients high grade neuroendocrine carcinoma small cell carcinoma exclude study . Evidence progressive disease within 12 month study entry Allowed prior therapy include : ) Surgery ( major surgery least four week prior baseline assessment ) ; b ) Locoregional therapy : chemoembolization , radioembolization , radiofrequency ablation , radiotherapy long progressive measurable disease outside area locoregional therapy progression previously treat area ; c ) Any number previous line systemic therapy . Last treatment enrollment must occur 4 week chemotherapy , 6 week antibodies 5 halflives prior tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKIs ) small molecule . Prior concurrent therapy somatostatin analog permit patient secretory NET All patient gastroenteropancreatic NETs must progress ( intolerant ) prior somatostatin analog . Patients pancreatic NETs must progress ( intolerant ) either everolimus sunitinib . Age ≥ 18 year Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 02 Life expectancy 12 week Adequate bone marrow function show : absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,000/mm^3 , Platelets ≥ 100,000/mm^3 , Hb &gt; 10 g/dl Adequate liver function show : serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN , serum transaminase activity ≤ 2.5 x ULN , exception serum transaminase ( &lt; 3 x ULN ) patient liver metastases Adequate renal function show serum creatinine ≤ 2 mg/dl Women childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test within 7 day administration first study treatment . Women must lactate . Both men woman childbearing potential must advise importance use effective birth control measure course study .
