	<brief_summary>Cardiac Arrest among leading cause death , survival still well 50 % majority survivor suffer moderate severe neurologic deficit . The human , social economic cost stagger . During resuscitation , damage mitigate chest compression medical care optimal , allow blood reach brain oxygen reach cell . Once heart start beating , call return spontaneous circulation , brain perfusion reestablish , usually normal . The damage brain fragile , sensitive change blood pressure metabolic abnormality , swell might set . Hypoperfusion persist , without clinician 's knowledge . All event damage brain diminish odds patient regain normal life . Therefore , hour follow return spontaneous circulation critical patient 's future recovery , constitute window opportunity maximize brain ability heal . In order optimize resuscitative effort post-arrest management , clinicians must know actually happen vital organ , brain . The problem difficult comatose patient . The available technology reveal indirect evidence brain suffering , like swell CT-scans , continuously evaluate bedside brain actually receive enough blood . The FDA recently approve device name c-flow , make ORNIM . This device look red blood cell brain speed move evaluate index cerebral perfusion . It sensors put patient 's forehead , emit detect ultrasound infrared light . This index inform clinician amount blood flow brain receives , put place quickly , even resuscitative effort , without danger patient . The study look well information obtain c-flow match one obtain indirect index , importantly , well predict patient outcome . The investigator wish establish threshold value index perfusion predict good recovery information may use optimize patient 's neurological outcome near future .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary Objective : Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation ( CPR ) undergo major paradigm shift , new emphasis optimize neurological recovery . As result , Cardio-Cerebral Resuscitation ( CCR ) prefer term describing protocol direct promote survival recovery cardiac arrest . Establishing maintain brain perfusion critical endpoint resuscitation ; however , currently simple reliable way evaluate adequacy brain tissue perfusion cardiac arrest patient . The overall goal NINCA study determine non-invasive cerebral blood flow index ( CFI ) use simple effective measurement brain perfusion resuscitation cardiac arrest . Our researcher hypothesize monitoring may one day routinely use ( 1 ) evaluate adequacy chest compression , ( 2 ) avoid brain tissue hypoperfusion induce excessive hyperventilation shivering , ( 3 ) serve endpoint goal-directed hemodynamic support , ( 4 ) evaluate potential neurological recovery , ( 5 ) help guide post-cardiac arrest care . Implications Further Research : Successful completion research hopefully establish non- invasive cerebral blood flow monitoring feasible CPR ; dependent adequate MAP , CO , temperature , SpO2 ventilation ; valid predictor neurological recovery . If confirm , monitor may one day become part standard ICU post-cardiac arrest monitoring even part standard resuscitation equipment . Determination optimal CFI threshold target support future study determine `` goal direct '' individualize post-resuscitation ICU care feasible use non-invasive cerebral perfusion index . This could lead new way optimize hemodynamic support , temperature management ventilation strategy maintain adequate cerebral perfusion improve neurological outcome .</detailed_description>
