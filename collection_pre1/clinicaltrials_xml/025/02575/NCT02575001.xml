	<detailed_description>Lately , mark increase incidence earlier age onset type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) note . These observation could also connect increase prevalence stressful experience lower stress tolerance child . The way person respond stress determine interplay genetic environmental factor . Environmental experience specific time development show shape individual 's hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis ( HPA axis ) stress response . It know , early development central nervous system critically dependent child 's interaction environment ( experience dependent maturation ) , especially attachment caregiver ( often mother ) . Appropriate caregiving connect low basal cortisol level child stable HPA axis response exposure stress . Any circumstance disturb formation attachment primary caregiver ( e.g . complication delivery , psychosocial stressor affect mother mother 's postpartum depression ) result high HPA axis responsiveness stress affect child . Changes individual gene also show influence person 's susceptibility stress risk development stress-induced psychopathology .</detailed_description>
