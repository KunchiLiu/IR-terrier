	<brief_title>Safety Powder-free Latex Allergy Protocol Operating Theatre : A Prospective , Observational Cohort Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction Allergic reaction natural rubber latex ( NRL , Latex ) important issue daily anesthesia practice . Latex allergy may result lesion consistent irritation dermatitis type 4 allergic contact dermatitis . But may also result type 1 allergic reaction potentially lethal . ( 1 ) The prevalence latex allergy general population estimate less 1 % , sensitization rise 5.4-7.6 % . ( 3,4 ) In certain population risk , prevalence latex allergy sensitization rise 17 % health care worker even 73 % patient expose latex regular basis ( eg . Patients spina bifida ) . These patient require special logistic organizational requirement stay operate room . Nowadays , guideline Belgian Society Anesthesiology Resuscitation ( BVAR-SARB ) American Association Anesthesiologists recommend patient schedule first case day . ( 1,3 ) In way , patient treat environment minimal amount airborne latex particle . After , study prove use powder latex glove cause substantial contamination operating room . Latex particles even remain airborne 5 hour afterwards. ( 1,3,5 ) . In consequence , guideline mention earlier dictate patient ( high risk ) latex allergy treat operating theatre leave unused least 3 6 hour . ( 1,2,6 ) Of course , requirement result organizational problem potentially result delay procedure , financial loss , patient discomfort dissatisfaction patient well hospital staff . The last year , professional suggest idea planning patient first case day longer necessary certain technical evolution current operating room practice . ( 7 ) In guideline publish Australasian Society Clinical Immunology Allergy ( last update March 2010 ) , patient risk know latex allergy longer schedule first case day . However , require removal powdered latex glove OR ( include pre-anesthesia unit , operate theatre , post anesthesia care unit surroundings ) . ( 8 ) The requirement completely latex free environment en material operate actual patient ( suspect ) latex allergy remain unchanged . Although several study show importance powder glove spread airborne latex particle basis protocol seam acceptable logical , currently literature confirm safety practice clinical setting . Study objective Primary objective : This study want evaluate safety latex safe protocol propose Australasian Society Clinical Immunology Allergy . In word , investigator hope demonstrate patient know latex allergy latex sensitisation treat safely operate theatre without special requirement towards schedule provide powdered latex glove remove OR environment ( preparation room , theatre , recovery room surroundings ) . In contrast , early guideline require theatre left unused least 3 hour patient suspect latex allergy operate theatre . Secondary objective : - The investigator want evaluate extend patient report latex allergy show risk factor latex allergy . - To investigate extend latex allergy proven laboratory test skin test patient report latex allergy . - Type latex allergic reaction patient report latex allergy . - The level satisfaction surgeon OR schedule staff new latex safe protocol switch powder free latex glove . Study procedure Pre-operative setting : Medical history , include allergy every patient assess . Every patient ( suspect ) latex allergy undergo surgery approach participate study . There restriction regard type surgery . The research team ask eligible patient sign inform consent . The researcher ask patient willing participate complete short questionnaire . Patients refuse participate treat protocol . However , contact order provide medical data relation study . During stay OR : Nursing staff anesthesiologist perform time-out procedure prior surgery . A ( suspect ) latex allergy mark electronic case file . The software register case send confirmation research team . At end procedure , anesthesiologist mark latex allergic reaction occur pop -up electronic case file . Post-operative setting : • Recovery room : Continuation latex safe protocol . When patient discharge ward , pop-up electronic case file ask type latex allergic reaction occur . The patient receives short note , explain research team contact him/her 72 hour . • Wards/ discharge hospital : The research team contact every patient mark latex allergic 72 hour surgery answer questionnaire allergic reaction latex ( phone person ) . Types latex reaction : 1 . Irritation dermatitis : non-allergic reaction skin irritans . Lesions limit area contact may occur minute hour exposure . Symptoms include itch , erythema , burn sensation , blistering , flakiness fissuring skin . This type reaction never life-threatening . ( 1,3,6 ) 2 . Allergic contact dermatitis delay cell- mediate hypersensitivity reaction type 4 reaction : T- cell mediate sensitivity chemical additive absorb skin . Lesions occur 6 48 hour follow exposure peak 48 72 hour . The lesion may exceed contact area consist itching , erythema , blister flakiness . ( Symptoms often resemble irritation dermatitis . ) ( 1,3,6 ) 3 . IgE mediate immediate hypersensitivity ( type 1 reaction : Based B-cell mediated production IgE ( immunoglobulin E ) antibodies towards Hev b latex protein first exposure . Symptoms already occur minute 1 hour , depend route exposure ( inhalation , parenteral mucous membrane exposure ) . The severity reaction also vary relation route exposure . Type 1 allergic reaction response latex exposure may lethal . ( 1,2,3 ) Note : • If research team ( daily practice : attend physician ) suspect latex allergic reaction study period , determine RIA ( radioimmunoassay ) - tryptase case anaphylactic reaction . Furthermore , patient refer allergy consultant skin prick test order confirm possible latex allergy . Satisfaction newly implement protocol : Starting 01-02-2016 , research team investigate level satisfaction newly implement protocol mean short questionnaire ( write E-mail ) send involved surgeon OR schedule staff . With questionnaire , investigator want evaluate - general satisfaction regard new protocol mean numeric rating scale range 0 ( unsatisfied ) 10 ( satisfy ) . - whether new protocol simplify OR schedule . The investigator mean numeric rating scale range 0 ( true ) 10 ( absolutely true ) . - level satisfaction regard new type surgical glove case surgeon switch.The investigator mean numeric rating scale range 0 ( unsatisfied ) 10 ( satisfy ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . All patient report prior latex allergic reaction 2 . High risk patient : Frequent blather catheterization : meningomyelocoele , spina bifida , congenital defect urogenital tract . A medical history multiple surgical procedure Atopic constitution ( asthma/hay fever/ eczema ) and/ specific food allergy , eczema ) and/ specific food allergy ( avocado , kiwi , banana , hazelnut , stone fruit , chest nut less extent grape , mango , melon , pineapple , fig , cherry , passion fruit , walnut ) ( 9 ) 3. professional exposure : health care worker , hairdresser , chemical industry The patient refuse cooperate . These patient treat way , although collect data . The patient patient unable cooperate result circumstance may interfere collect data make unreliable . Eg . Language barrier .</criteria>
