	<brief_summary>Introduction : Intravenous infusion amino acid cesarean delivery mother neonates improves neonatal growth . Amino acid anesthesia also prevent hypothermia associate untoward effect . Method : After ethical approval , prospective randomize double blind control study conduct university hospital BPKIHS . Seventy six parturients ( ASA 1 &amp; 2 ) undergo cesarean delivery without fetal distress , intrauterine growth retardation , congenital malformation premature labor enrol . For period start approximately one hour prior spinal anesthesia , Group 1 Group 2 patient receive 200 ml amino acid lactate ringer solution respectively 2 ml/kg/hr . The ambient operating room temperature maintain near 23º C. No heat method apply apart cover blanket . Primary outcome measure neonatal rectal temperature 0 , 5 10 min birth . Secondary outcome measure APGAR score suckle reflex newborn , change rectal temperature relative baseline discomfort relate cold sensation mother occurrence shiver duration hospital stay mother newborn .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Review literature : Hypothermia common peri-operative period ( 1 ) . It lead shiver ( 2 ) , sympathetic stimulation ( 3 ) , ischemic cardiac event ( 3 ) , coagulation disturbance ( 4,5 ) delay recovery anesthesia ( 6,7 ) , alter immune system impair wound healing ( 8,9 ) prolong hospitalization ( 9 ) . Amino acid infusion surgery know prevent peri-operative hypothermia result increase thermogenesis ( 10,11 ) without additional sympatho-adrenal activity ( 12 ) . The mechanism base nutrient induced thermogenesis ; i.e. , nutrient intake , especially proteins amino acid , stimulates rest energy expenditure heat production ( 13 ) . This effect pronounce general anesthesia neuraxial block ( 14 ) . It also prove amino acid infusion and/or anesthesia surgery decrease intra-operative blood loss ( 15 ) , improve peri-operative recovery ( 16 ) shortens duration hospital stay ( 17 ) . The safety intravenous amino acid infusion cesarean delivery long ago establish ( 18,19 ) .While maternal intravenous administration amino-acids lead increased level amino acid maternal venous blood fetal umbilical cord blood plasma , increase fetal uptake amino acid . The safety amino acid first day life delivery also already prove ( 20,21 ) . It use achieve positive protein balance immediate postoperative period neonate undergo abdominal surgery ( 20 ) . Aggressive therapy intravenous amino acid preterm infant 12 hrs two week birth enhance growth improve nutritional status hospitalization ( 21 ) . Rationale study : One way prevent development hypothermia anesthesia stimulate endogenous heat production . Energy expenditure increase ingestion infusion nutrient . The amount energy expend baseline , thermic effect food mainly represent energy cost nutrient absorption , handle , storage . Among different nutrient , protein elicit large increase energy expenditure heat production . Previous study find intravenous amino acid infusion exert enhance thermogenic effect general anesthesia ( 10 ) The mechanism behind phenomenon fully understood , although nutrient intake stimulates energy expenditure , hence heat production , awake state ( 13 ) . The administration proteins/amino acid awake individual result approximately 20 % increase whole-body heat content significant increase body temperature ( 22,23 ) . Since amino acid transfer across placenta depend upon concentration maternal blood ( 21,24 ) , investigator hypothesize increase concentration maternal blood , amino acid level newborn increase . The amino acid induce increased thermogenesis mother likely increase maternal temperature thus fetal temperature . Also amino acid cross placenta may increase thermogenesis fetus , enhance neonatal temperature . Research design methodology : After get approval institutional research ethic committee write informed consent , prospective randomize double blind study conduct University hospital B P Koirala Institute Health Sciences ( BPKIHS ) . Parturients belong American Society Anesthesiologists physical status I II schedule elective cesarean delivery enrol . Pregnancy fetal distress , intrauterine growth retardation , congenital malformation premature labor exclude . With help computer generate random number , consecutive eligible patient schedule cesarean delivery assign one two group receive 200 ml intravenous amino acid ( Active drug ) ( n=38 ) nutrient free standard ringer lactate solution ( active comparator ) ( n=38 ) 2 ml/kg/hr approximately one hour spinal anesthesia . Amino acid solution use balanced mixture 18 pure crystalline amino acid , eight essential amino acid ( Alamin SN ® , Albert D Limited , Kolkata , India ) . On pre-anesthetic visit one day prior surgery , patient explain nature study various question ask study . Approximately 90 minute prior surgery , patient take pre-operative room inside operation theater . Heart rate , respiratory rate , rectal temperature SpO2 monitor continuously non invasive blood pressure every five minute . To maintain blinding , infusion bag cover opaque plastic sheet label 'infusion bag ' hang infusion stand near patient anesthetist involve management data collection thereafter . Intravenous infusion amino acid solution ringer 's solution start approximately one hour prior spinal anesthesia record baseline vital parameter . Each patient receive total 200 ml 2 ml/kg/min . Both patient assessor unaware group assignment . After one hour infusion , patient transfer operating room . The ambient temperature operate room maintain near 23°C . The monitoring non invasive blood pressure , heart rate , respiratory rate , oxygen saturation ( SpO2 ) rectal temperature continue interval . Spinal anesthesia induce 2 ml 0.5 % bupivacaine L 3-4 inter-space apply aseptic precaution patient lateral position . After administration spinal anesthesia , group receive Ringers solution 15-20 ml/kg/hr maintain ambient temperature via separate venous access . All patient cover blanket , heat method apply . Amino acid infusion continue till completion 200 ml solution contain infusion bag . The maternal rectal temperature record infusion ( baseline ) , prior spinal block , time delivery , half one hour spinal block , end infusion 200 ml study solution . At end surgery , mother ask perception cold relate discomfort 0-2 subjective scale ( 0= No perception , 1= Tolerable perception , 2=Intolerable perception ) . The rectal temperature APGAR score assess 0 , 5 10 minute suckle reflex 10 minute birth baby . The occurrence shiver duration hospital stay note mother baby . Primary outcome parameter neonatal rectal temperature 0 , 5 10 minute birth . Secondary outcome parameter include neonatal APGAR score 0 , 5 10 minute birth , number newborn suckle reflex ; number neonate develop shiver within 10 minute birth , duration hospital stay neonate assess time discharge ; change maternal rectal temperature relative baseline various time point study drug infusion , maternal temperature time delivery intraoperative period ; number mother develop cold sensation relate discomfort intra-operative period ; number mother develop shiver intra-operative period , duration hospital stay mother assess time discharge . The sample size calculate use online statistical calculator G power ( R ) version 3.0.1 . Cohen use calculate effect size base finding previous study . ( 14 ) The mean final core temperature 90 min induction spinal anaesthesia 35.8 ( SEM 0.1 ) °C saline group 36.6 ( 0.1 ) °C amino acid group . ( 14 ) It estimate sample size 34 group could achieve power 80 % detect effect size 0.69 outcome measure maternal core body temperature , assume type 1 error 0.05. investigator enrol 38 patient group compensate dropout case shift normality data distribution .</detailed_description>
