	<brief_summary>The reason chronic constipation ( CC ) become common age fully understood . New study suggest bowel contraction pattern , dietary fibre gut bacteria important may differ old people . Since CC reduce quality life major reason elderly admit hospital residential care , need understand factor change age . Currently , place pressure sense catheter inside large intestine ( pancolonic manometry ) gold standard way measure well contract . However involve camera test ( colonoscopy ) invasive risk bowel perforation ( ~80/100,000 ) . The risk high age ( 64-80yr : ~90/100,000; 80+yrs : ~120/100,000 ) , make unethical elderly . A technique call 3D-Transit System develop , involve small ingestible capsule , contain 'trackable ' electromagnet . By track movement capsule swallow participant , provide precise detailed information capsule progression inside whole gut large bowel 's contractile activity real-time . It minimally-invasive radiation-free , make possible ass elderly first time . This study aim assess bowel contraction pattern , dietary fibre intake gut bacteria differ young old adult ( without CC ) , good understand CC common elderly . It pilot , 4 arm , single centre , observational study involve 60 woman age 18-40 year 70-90 year ( 15 non-constipated 15 CC age group ) . The study last 3 week , contain 2 week run-in period 1 week study period . The four group participant ask : swallow 2 capsule assess large bowel 's contractile function use 3D-transit system; provide stool sample analyse gut bacteria; complete questionnaire assess gastrointestinal symptom .</brief_summary>
