	<detailed_description>Bisphosphonates ( BP ) widely use prevention treatment osteoporosis postmenopausal woman old men . Recently , concern risk adverse event several year use agent . This result publication Food Drug Administration suggest , many individual , holiday bisphosphonates might consider 4-5 year continuous use . In publication little , , guidance clinician proceed holiday initiate . Bisphosphonates likely work first bind hydroxyapatite crystal , crystal dissolve acid medium create osteoclast process bone resorption , bisphosphonate release , incorporate osteoclast inhibits farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase interfere intracellular protein trafficking . The consequence loss osteoclast resorptive activity case osteoclast apoptosis . Thus potency particular bisphosphonate dependent independent process , bind affinity hydroxyapatite potency enzyme inhibition . As patient remain bisphosphonates , likely drug become incorporated skeleton . Therefore , drug discontinue , gradually leach skeleton . The rate effect drug wear ( `` off-rate '' ) , evidence change biochemical marker bone turnover , dependent binding affinity . The length time pharmacologic effect continue also dependent potency enzyme inhibition . Thus , bisphosphonate likely unique off-rate . Data extension clinical trial support concept variable rate , head head data determine . Furthermore , clinical trial data may limited utility patient see practice set . Biochemical marker show number study reliable surrogate marker overall rate bone remodel skeleton . After menopause ovariectomy , serum level biochemical marker increase increment associated rate bone loss measure dual x-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) . As individual age , fracture risk determine age bone mineral density ( BMD ) . Trabecular bone score ( TBS ) , advanced application DXA , describe quality bone microarchitecture , show impact bone strength thus fracture risk . In clinical trial data bisphosphonates discontinue subject continue follow , biochemical marker increase drug stop , presumably fracture benefit drug gradually lose . Concern possible association long term side effect bisphosphonates ( notably osteonecrosis jaw atypical fracture femoral shaft ) lead concept , endorsed FDA , drug holiday . At present guideline patient follow drug discontinue . From clinical trial data different subject population differ protocol , well vitro data , inference may draw effect vary different drug . It hypothesize risedronate lose effect rapidly alendronate . However , concept never study prospective clinical study . Therefore , intent prospective study examine patient take 2 different bisphosphonate drug compare rate use two establish biochemical marker ( sCTX P1NP ) .</detailed_description>
