	<detailed_description>OUTLINE : This multi-center trial . The phase 1 dose escalation trial evaluate MLN0128 standard 3+3 successive cohort design identify high plan dose level . Phase II trial subject 1:1 randomize receive either MLN0128 ( investigational arm ) sorafenib ( control arm ) . PHASE I DOSE ESCALATION INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT : Cohort 1 ( dose level +1 ) consist 3-6 evaluable patient receive MLN0128 15mg day 1 28-day cycle . Cohort 2 ( dose level +2 ) consist 3-6 evaluable patient receive MLN0128 20mg day 1 28-day cycle . Cohort 3 ( dose level +3 ) consist 3-6 evaluable patient receive MLN0128 30mg day 1 28-day cycle . Subjects evaluate dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) first 28 day treatment ( 1 cycle ) . However , decision move next dose escalation cohort make subject complete 2 cycle therapy give dose . There dose escalation beyond dose level +3 . PHASE II INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT : Randomization take place follow completion screen evaluation eligibility assessment . Stratification factor employ randomization minimize between-arm assignment imbalance . - 1 Child-Pugh score 5-6 - 2 Child-Pugh score 7 Within stratum , subject randomly assign equal probability either investigational arm ( Arm A : MLN0128 ) control arm ( Arm B : sorafenib ) . Arm A : MLN0128 administer orally recommended phase II dose ( RP2D ) weekly . Arm B : Sorafenib administer 400mg PO BID daily , dose adjustment per standard care . A new treatment cycle ( 1 cycle = 28 day ) initiate follow condition meet : - Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.5 x 10*9/L - Platelets ≥ 50 x 10*9/L - Non-hematologic treatment related toxicity improve grade 1 resolve per Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events v4.0 ( CTCAE ) Treatment may continue progression , unacceptable toxicity , withdrawal study . Estimated Life Expectancy : ≥ 3 month Subjects must adequate organ function , specify , within 7 day study registration : Bone marrow reserve consistent : - Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.5 x 10*9/L - Platelet count ≥ 50 x 10*9/L - Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL Hepatic : - Total bilirubin ≤ 2 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) - Transaminases ( aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) , serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase ( SGOT ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase ( SGPT ) ≤ 5 x ULN Renal : - Creatinine clearance ≥50 mL/min base either Cockcroft-Gault estimate base urine collection ( 12 24 hour ) Metabolic : - Fasting serum glucose ( ≤ 130 mg/dL ) fast triglyceride ≤ 300 mg/dL . - Glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) &lt; 7.0 %</detailed_description>
