	<brief_summary>The main objective study analyze effect dry needling soleus muscle modulate muscle tone healthy non-injured subject . The secondary objective study effect occur due change neural mechanical component ( ) . Hypothesis : Deep Dry Needling latent medial Myofascial Trigger Point ( MTrP ) soleus muscle produce change muscle tone vary passive resistance torque rate 180ยบ/ .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness Deep Dry Needling Muscle Tone Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methods : It double-blinded randomized clinical trial subject healthy volunteer city Toledo 18 40 year . There intervention group ( dry needle medial MTrP soleus muscle ) control group ( dry needling distal MTrP taut muscle band soleus muscle ) . The intervention unique session . Intervention : Dry needling technique perform locate taut band Myofascial Trigger Point . After , thin needle ( 0,32x40mm ) introduce directly Myofascial Trigger Point aim generate `` local twitch response '' involuntary contraction muscle fiber . This puncture may reproduce patient 's symptom , cause muscle relaxation achieve time relief muscle tension pain also recover metabolism muscle . Assessment : The mechanical neural property muscle tone evaluate use isokinetic dynamometry H-reflex test measurement , respectively Isokinetic dynamometric technique consider valid biomechanics method measure muscle tone non-injured subject . The H-reflex utilized probe study neurophysiological phenomenon . This measurement use assess response nervous system various neurologic condition , musculoskeletal injury , application therapeutic modality , pain , exercise training , performance motor task . Outcome measure : Outcome measure include passive resistive torque ankle dorsiflexion , dorsiflexion passive range motion ( PROM ) , maximal isometric voluntary force ( MIVF ) H-reflex M-response measurement evaluate , 10 min 1 week intervention .</detailed_description>
