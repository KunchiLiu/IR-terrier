	<brief_summary>Contrast-induced nephropathy become third-largest cause hospital acquire acute renal injury , morbidity less renal hypoperfusion renal toxicity drug , 11 % case . Pathophysiologic mechanisms contrast-induced nephropathy ( CIN ) entirely clear yet . May associate renal hemodynamic change , medullary ischemia renal blood flow reduction , oxidative stress , endothelial dysfunction , contrast agent damage epithelium renal tubular directly . Currently study prove inflammation ( CRP , TNF-α NF-қB ) play role CIN.It well-know hyperhomocysteinemia ( HHCY ) independent risk factor cardiovascular disease , pro-inflammatory effect . Researches show Hcy stimulate CRP generation NMDAr-ROS-ERK1 / 2 / p38-NF-қB signal pathway trigger inflammatory response . We compare CIN incidence different plasma Hcy level adult hypertensive patient undergo coronary artery diagnosis treatment ( CAG PCI ) . CIN define absolute ≥0.5mg/dl relative ≥25 % increase serum creatinine level 48 hour procedure . The relationship decrease plasma Hcy level blood pressure value use Enalapril Maleate Folic Acid Tablets ( program-based antihypertension ) recovery CIN observe . Using univariate multivariate Logistic regression analyse relationship HHcy CIN , take receiver operate characteristic ( ROC ) curve select best Hcy plasma level predict CIN probability . This study help u understand relationship HHcy CIN course procedure adult hypertensive patient , preoperative plasma Hcy level predict incidence CIN whether Enalapril Maleate Folic Acid tablet reduce CIN hypertensive patient HHcy . Which important clinical significance . This study also offer feasibility research HHcy play role pathogenesis specific signal pathways CIN .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Relationship Between HHcy Contrast-induced Nephropathy Hypertensive Patients After Coronary Artery Diagnosis Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The first stage : establishment hypothesis relationship HHcy CIN The demographic laboratory data retrieve His system . Hypertensive patient underwent coronary artery diagnosis treatment ( CAG PCI ) Fuling Central Hospital Chongqing City June 2013 August 2015 initially include present study . The baseline characteristic hypertensive patient accord tertile plasma homocysteine level analyse , investigate incidence CIN relevant factor . The second stage : To verify hypothesis relationship HHcy CIN patient hypertension CER research method 1. patient accept coronary artery diagnosis treatment ( CAG PCI ) departments Geriatrics Cardiovascular within one year initially participate . According statistic finish , proportion hypertension total patient underwent procedure reach 80 % , 4000 patient hypertension within 1 year involve . The level plasma Hcy total patient detect . The patient divide 2 group accord plasma Hcy level , The hypertensive patient ( adult ) plasma Hcy level ≥10 umol/L take Enalapril Maleate Folic Acid Tablets ( program-based antihypertension ) , The hypertensive patient ( adult ) plasma Hcy level &lt; 10 umol/L take Enalapril Maleate Tablets ( program-based antihypertension ) .The procedure carry blood pressure valve within normal range . 2 . All patient follow 3 month , return hospital 3 time ( month ) discharge . Urine routine renal function test , register blood pressure , change body condition related factor per month , plasma Hcy level detect hypertensive patient higher-homocysteinemia second third month discharge . 3 . Data collection data statistic carry per 2 month . All patient undergo coronary artery diagnosis treatment ( CAG PCI ) divide group A without hypertension , group B hypertensive patient plasma Hcy level &lt; 10 umol/L group C hypertensive patient plasma Hcy level ≥10 umol/L . To compare CIN incidence 3 group time point , CIN incidence group B group C compare , association CIN level blood pressure plasma Hcy analyze multivariate logistic regression analysis accord ROC curve .</detailed_description>
