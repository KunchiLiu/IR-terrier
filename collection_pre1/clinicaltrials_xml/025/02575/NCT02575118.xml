	<detailed_description>Bisphenol A ( BPA ) xenoestrogen show cause abnormality sexual development may lead reproductive damage animal . In epidemiological study BPA associate various health effect . The majority dental plastic filling material contain polymer synthesize BPA . Whether BPA release vivo polymer-based filling - , dose - sufficiently examine . Patients schedule regular dental examination public dental clinic , Bergen Downtown District , need therapy dental polymer-based filling material suitable study ( inclusion / exclusion criterion ) inform project . If patient want participate study , he/she give write information study consent form . It emphasize participation study voluntary patient opportunity read information home , next appointment clinic . The clinical treatment carious lesion ( ) perform accord standardized procedure material use clinic . After cure , fill polish accord standard procedure . The curing lamp control documented weekly project period . All treatment session schedule morning 9 . Questions regard food intake dental hygiene habit include questionnaire answer study . Samples saliva urine collect immediately fill placement 1 hour , 24 hour 1 week treatment . A saliva sample also collect immediately treatment . No food drink intake allow midnight sample collection . Only tapped water permit . The sampling procedure control advance , risk contamination sample minimize . After collection sample refrigerate stored frozen -80 Â°C analysis . Bisphenol A saliva urine determine liquid chromatography mass spectrometry ( LC-MS ) . The detection limit method estimate 0.1 ng BPA/ml . The study approve Regional Committee Medical Health Research ( reference number 2014/1529 ) . Patients participate project collect saliva sample five time urine sample four time , involve extra visit clinic . The biomedical outcome ( concentration bisphenol A saliva urine ) assess pre-defined group individual . The participant may enrol study fulfil criterion ( include need dental filling ) . The participant receive intervention ( placement dental filling ) enrol study . Subjects study receive therapeutic intervention , investigator assign intervention subject study . Thus , study may describe observational study .</detailed_description>
