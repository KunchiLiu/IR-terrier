	<brief_summary>This phase Ib/II trial study side effect best dose pan fibroblast growth factor receptor ( FGFR ) kinase inhibitor BGJ398 give together fluorouracil , irinotecan hydrochloride oxaliplatin ( combination chemotherapy ) treat patient untreated pancreatic cancer spread another place body . Pan FGFR kinase inhibitor BGJ398 may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , fluorouracil , irinotecan hydrochloride oxaliplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving pan FGFR kinase inhibitor BGJ398 together fluorouracil , irinotecan hydrochloride oxaliplatin may better treatment pancreatic cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine dose-limiting toxicity , maximum tolerate dose recommended phase II dose BGJ398 ( pan FGFR kinase inhibitor BGJ398 ) administer combination modify ( ) FOLFIRINOX ( fluorouracil , irinotecan hydrochloride oxaliplatin ) patient advance pancreatic colorectal cancer patient . ( Phase Ib ) II . To determine 6-month overall survival rate patient treatment-naïve metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma treat BGJ398 plus mFOLFIRINOX . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine pharmacokinetic profile BGJ398 , fluorouracil , oxaliplatin , irinotecan ( irinotecan hydrochloride ) metabolites administered combination explore drug-drug interaction . ( Phase Ib ) II . To determine 1-year overall survival rate , response rate , progression free survival cancer antigen ( CA ) 19-9 change treatment-naïve metastatic pancreatic cancer patient treat BGJ398 plus mFOLFIRINOX . ( Phase II ) III . To determine safety tolerability BGJ398 combination mFOLFIRINOX study population . IV . To explore plasma tumor biomarkers associate efficacy study combination . OUTLINE : This phase Ib , dose-escalation study pan FGFR kinase inhibitor BGJ398 follow phase II study . Patients receive oxaliplatin intravenously ( IV ) 2 hour , irinotecan hydrochloride IV 90 minute , fluorouracil IV continuously 46 hour day 1 15 . Patients also receive pan FGFR kinase inhibitor BGJ398 orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 8-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 28 day every 4 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
