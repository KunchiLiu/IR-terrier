A complex intervention design base framework UK Medical Research Council employ guide develop evaluate intervention . This study consist three phase : 1. model phase adapt original Guided Self-Determination program adult type 2 diabetes , use qualitative design 2. feasibility assessment adapt intervention web , employ qualitative quantitative method 3. evaluate effectiveness intervention diabetes self-management behaviour HbA1c , use quasi-experimental design . The two first phase provide important information development intervention acceptability , whereas third phase assess effect health care outcomes systematically develop intervention .</detailed_description>
