	<detailed_description>The design single-blinded , single-site pragmatic superiority RCT 3 parallel arm : comprehensive CR ( education exercise ) versus exercise-based CR ( education , deliver Brazil ) versus wait list control ( i.e. , CR ) . Patient assessment undertaken pre-randomization 6 12 month later ( accordance end CR ) . Mortality ascertain 6 month 1 year post-recruitment . The main program 6 month duration , 36 1-hour exercise session offer follow frequency : 1. participant come CR 12 session , 3x week ( total 4 week intervention ) . 2. participant come CR 8 session , 2x week ( total 4 week intervention ) . 3. participant come CR 12 session , 1x week ( total 12 week intervention ) . Each participant receive individualize exercise prescription base grade exercise stress test . Participants exercise 50 80 % heart rate reserve . In stages patient request exercise community day week , accumulate 30 minute physical activity moderate vigorous-intensity 5 day per week , recommend guideline . In comprehensive CR arm , 24 session education offer , 30 minute duration . More specifically , education component consist : - weekly group education session , strategically map base patient ' information need sequence support program learning outcome . Education session deliver health educator team . See table 1 CR program schedule , include educational topic ( e.g.. diet , medication exercise ) . - A comprehensive education workbook accompany session , contain 20 chapter . The empirically-validated English version translate culturally-adapted Brazilian-Portuguese . Clinicians patient review material , plain language clear design review complete preparation trial . The standard care Brazilian adult CVD include access CR patient , give gross lack capacity . All participant follow-up appointment physician deem medically appropriate . Consistent CONSORT guideline , usual care describe detail participant ( e.g. , number health visit - inpatient outpatient , treatment ) . The number patient approach date record , well reason inclusion/exclusion . With informed write consent patient CR clearance physician , potentially eligible participant schedule come on-site complete pre-test assessment . Participants ask complete sociodemographic questionnaire , establish generalizability sample , among survey . Clinical information extract participant ' chart . Eligible participant randomize one 3 group . The randomization sequence generate use random.org website random block 4 , 1:1:1 allocation ratio . To ensure allocation concealment , local principal investigator allocation sequence password-protected file , provide randomization information student confirm participant eligible . Due nature intervention , participant doctoral student blind treatment allocation . The primary outcome functional capacity assess 6 12 month . All post-test assessment undertaken 6 12 month post-randomization . Mortality ascertain hospital chart family phone call 6 month 1-year . With regard 6 12 month assessment , participant invite come study center : 1. undertake shuttle walk test indicator functional capacity , 2. undertake assessment secondary outcome include blood draw lipid , 3. complete survey relate tertiary outcome . A master 's student blind random allocation undertake post-test assessment , outcome ascertainment data entry . To minimize loss follow-up , investigator send mail telephone reminder patient come on-site assessment , base Dillman method . Measures Participants ask complete sociodemographic questionnaire . Clinical characteristic extract medical chart , include sex , age , risk factor , cardiac history , cardiac test result , comorbidities medication . These base Canadian Cardiovascular Society core element demographic data definition . CR session attendance extract program chart post-test participant randomize CR arm .</detailed_description>
