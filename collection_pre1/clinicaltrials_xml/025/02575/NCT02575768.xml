	<brief_summary>Exertional angina common symptom patient severe aortic stenosis ( AS ) without obstructive coronary artery disease ( CAD ) . Although reduced myocardial flow reserve one propose explanation angina , little known pathophysiology . This study aim adenosine-stress cardiac magnetic resonance use assessment myocardial perfusion reserve suggest pathophysiology development angina patient severe AS without obstructive CAD .</brief_summary>
