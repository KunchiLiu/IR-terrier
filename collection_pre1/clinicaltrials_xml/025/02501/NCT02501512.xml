	<brief_summary>This study aim extract discriminate signal respiration , heart rate swallow standard ECG EMG signal obtain use special neonatal gastric tube . These signal compare standard monitoring signal neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ) . Further , use search objectively quantifiable maturational coordination process respiration , heart rate swallowing . Lastly , study aim identify change ECG/EMG-signals result external stimulus ( e.g . nursing intervention ) NICU .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Coordination respiration , heart rate swallow preterm term neonate subject various study past ; impeccable functioning key criterion fulfil infant discharge home NICU . Whether coordination ability depend gestational age diagnose objectively remain controversial . Also , ideal time point start introduce suck feed challenge coordination breathe swallow unknown largely remain matter trial error risk cause iatrogenic aspiration milk baby ready suck feed . Successful coordination swallow breathe generally consider high neurological function represent mile stone overall child development . Therefore , measurement level functioning could potential serve predictor neurological outcome . However , yet unknown extent difficulty preterm infant allow prediction concern neurological development future outcome . One major reason unsolved question lie lack diagnostic tool objectively measure suck-swallow-breathing coordination sufficient accuracy , make precise analysis coordination pattern preterm infant almost impossible . Considering relevance question , seem important develop tool observe coordination breathing , heart rate swallow neonate possibly great accuracy . In single-centre pilot study 15 preterm infant 32 42 week gestational age include . Transesophageal ECG EMG signal measure use Edi-gastric tube ( Maquet , Getinge Group , Solna Sweden ) , CE-certified neonatal gastric tube equip electrode . Due proximity esophageal electrode within gastric tube heart diaphragm , esophageal ECG EMG signal acquire probably less susceptible motion artefact baby commonly use skin electrode . This well know measurement adult . Moreover , motion esophageal electrode due peristalsis , respiration cardiac motion superimposes ECG baseline wander might surrogate coordination ability preterm infant . Using novel esophageal data study 's goal obtain objective data represent maturational pattern breathe , heart rate , swallow preterm infant . Possibly derive coordination pattern might help guide nurse clinician introduce suck feed develop specific early intervention strategy . Furthermore , gastric tube-EMG prof accessible real time , could potentially replace standard monitoring tool require use skin electrodes future . This would facilitate nursing preserve skin integrity also simplify bond parent infant NICU .</detailed_description>
