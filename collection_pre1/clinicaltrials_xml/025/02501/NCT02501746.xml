	<brief_summary>Specific Aims : Bridging Income Generation GrouP Integrated Care ( BIGPIC ) Over 80 % cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) death occur low- middle-income country ( LMICs ) . Diabetes , major risk factor CVD , also responsible substantial morbidity mortality LMICs . Elevated blood pressure ( BP ) increase CVD risk among individual diabetes pre-diabetes ; BP control therefore powerful way reduce CVD risk . Cost-effective , culturally appropriate , context-specific approach critical . Two promise strategy improve health outcome group medical visit microfinance . Both increase quality care , clinician-patient trust , self-efficacy , health saving , self-confidence , group cohesion , social support . While strategy successful context , impact CVD risk reduction among diabetic pre-diabetics low-resource setting know . In partnership Government Kenya , Academic Model Providing Access Healthcare ( AMPATH ) Partnership expand clinical scope work include diabetes hypertension . AMPATH pilot group care microfinance initiative among patient chronic disease promise early result . Both strategy feasible , integration group medical visit microfinance group . However , effectiveness strategy individually , combination , improve CVD risk know . Thus , objective proposal utilize transdisciplinary implementation research approach address challenge reduce CVD risk low-resource setting . The central hypothesis : group medical visit integrate microfinance group effective cost-effective reduce CVD risk among individual diabetes increase risk diabetes western Kenya , key modifiable CVD risk factor address BP . The research team hypothesize group medical visit microfinance may reduce CVD risk , integration group medical visit microfinance yield large gain . Also hypothesize change social network characteristic may mediate impact intervention primary outcome , baseline social network characteristic may moderate impact intervention . To test hypothesis achieve overall objective , follow specific aim pursue : Aim 1 : Identify contextual factor , facilitator , barrier may impact integration group medical visit microfinance CVD risk reduction , use combination qualitative research method : 1 ) baraza ( traditional community gathering ) form inquiry ; 2 ) focus group discussion among individual diabetes increase risk diabetes , microfinance group member , rural health worker . Subsidiary Aim 1.1 : Use identify facilitator barrier develop contextually culturally appropriate integrate group medical visit-microfinance model reduce CVD risk among individual diabetes increase risk diabetes .

	<detailed_description>The Academic Model Providing Access Healthcare Partnership ( AMPATH ) initiate Kenya 2001 . In 2009 , AMPATH designate Center Excellence Cardiovascular Pulmonary Disease Research NHLBI , program 's research portfolio include CVD , diabetes , risk factor . Population-based prevalence diabetes hypertension Kenya well known , estimate vary accord technique , definition , geography . Prevalence rate range 1 % 12 % diabetes , 5 % 24 % hypertension . The low range figure self-reported disease likely underestimate true prevalence due low awareness screen chronic disease region . In response substantial grow burden diabetes hypertension , AMPATH form Chronic Disease Management ( CDM ) Program , establish productive partnership Kenyan government local community , order optimize care delivery chronic disease , diabetes hypertension . AMPATH Memorandum Understanding Kenyan Ministry Public Health Sanitation Ministry Medical Services test evaluate innovative approach chronic disease management . The CDM Program develop robust diabetes hypertension management protocol derive International Diabetes Federation , World Health Organization ( WHO ) , Joint National Commission 7 8 guideline diabetes hypertension management , use drug contain Kenyan national formulary . The CDM program 's intervention deliver Ministry Health facility associate personnel . In addition , AMPATH develop innovative , community-based solution ensure consistent secure supply essential medicine . The CDM Program enrol 2,000 patient diabetes 3,100 patient hypertension , cared nine rural health center 30 rural dispensary . However , achieve BP control challenge ; preliminary analysis CDM Program data indicate despite average reduction systolic BP ( SBP ) 9.3 mmHg , 30-40 % CDM patient population control BP . Thus , program actively seek innovative approach optimize care delivery outcomes patient . AMPATH also sensitive economic reality catchment population , recognize average daily income substantial proportion client le one US dollar per day . AMPATH create Safety Net Program improve economic security client without encourage dependency , promote income-generating activity . The program conduct preliminary work organize microfinance group , initially start HIV patient pregnant woman , recently expand patient diabetes hypertension . Based model Village-Level Savings Loan Associations , AMPATH 's microfinance program client-driven model involve creation community saving group . Thus , microfinance group member mobilize manage saving , provide interest-bearing loan group member , offer limited form financial insurance , contribute social fund use case emergency welfare issue group member . AMPATH also provide group member specific train agribusiness , entrepreneurship , financial literacy , accounting , marketing , group dynamic , support engagement sustainable income-generating activity . Since program launch November 2010 , total 9,969 client ( 83.8 % female , 16.2 % male ) , 508 group , cumulative deposit $ 250,000 social fund nearly $ 23,000 . The microfinance program increase group membership 14 % retention rate 98 % . An impact evaluation microfinance program reveal group member increase monthly income 10 % increased weekly expenditure food per household 18 % . This research project conduct within AMPATH catchment area , six Divisions western Kenya , geographically administratively divide Community Units ( CUs ) approximately 6,000 individual : Burnt Forest ( 4 CUs ) , Chulaimbo ( 8 ) , Endebess ( 4 ) , Kapsara ( 6 ) , Matunda ( 4 ) , Moi 's Bridge ( 6 ) . Each Division rural health facility ( rural health center rural dispensary ) staff clinical officer ( mid-level practitioner ) nurse , CHWs villages . There longstanding positive relationship among AMPATH , healthcare provider , community . The CDM program establish presence community . Conceptual Framework Both microfinance group medical visit improve health outcomes many mechanism . The research team hypothesize intervention cause change social network characteristic , lead improved intermediate factor ( diet , physical activity , medication adherence , retention care ) , ultimately yield CVD risk reduction . It also possible intervention impact intermediate factor health outcomes independent social network characteristic . Likewise , change social network characteristic may mediate relationship intervention CVD risk reduction independent intermediate factor . In addition , intervention may relate health outcome independent pathway . Finally , baseline difference social network characteristic may moderate impact microfinance group medical visit CVD risk reduction . Microfinance increase saving ( specifically health saving ) income , lead increased ability pay healthy food , medicine , diagnostic service , specialty consultation , health insurance , thereby improve diet , medication adherence retention care . Microfinance also lead improved financial literacy , self-confidence , decision-making agency , positively impact intermediate factor , subsequently CVD risk reduction . Likewise , group medical visit increase efficiency care delivery , improve quality care , encourage self-efficacy , increase level clinician-patient trust , improve intermediate factor thereby achieve CVD risk reduction . Both intervention change social network characteristic within two three month , create group cohesion , social support , share experience , lead social environment conducive healthy behavior choice , medication adherence , retention care , maximize effectiveness . Social network influence behavior several theoretical mechanism : information behavior change , perception social norm , how-to knowledge , social comparison . Through mechanism , individual diabetes increase risk diabetes achieve CVD risk reduction . It likely integrate group medical visit microfinance group may yield even well outcome , combination mechanism describe . To assess independent effect group medical visit , microfinance , integrate group medical visits-microfinance group , four-arm trial propose . In addition , investigator assess whether change social network characteristic mediate relationship intervention , intermediate factor , primary outcome . Finally , research team assess baseline difference social network characteristic moderate relationship intervention primary outcome . In sum , Bridging Income Generation GrouP Integrated Care ( BIGPIC ) study able ass comprehensively relationship microfinance , group medical visit , social network , intermediate factor , CVD risk reduction among individual diabetes increase risk diabetes . Subsidiary Aim 1.1 : Develop contextually culturally appropriate integrate group medical visit-microfinance model CVD risk reduction AMPATH 's Community Strategy Initiative routinely engage exist community-based governance structure gather input feedback community-based initiative . In addition , AMPATH Safety Net Program routinely gather feedback community member , microfinance intervention evolve result input . The research team adhere principle propose project . A participatory , iterative design process purse create `` design team '' consist one facilitator , two research team member , two clinician , two CHWs , two patient , research assistant . The design team meet several design session period four week . The design process involve three phase : brainstorming , conceptualization , creation . During brainstorming , facilitator first acquaint team finding qualitative study specify criterion integrate group medical visit-microfinance intervention ( i.e . prototype describe Aim 2 , incorporate content focus group mabaraza ) . In conceptualization phase , team evaluate advantage disadvantage idea result brainstorming , develop concrete model . The creation phase involve actual creation integrate group medical visit-microfinance model CVD risk reduction among individual diabetes increase risk diabetes . Educational material develop English , Kiswahili , local language use standard approach translation back-translation . Once integrated group medical visit-microfinance model develop , two FGDs conduct patient , microfinance group member , health worker , order ass acceptability feasibility . The investigator previously use type approach positive community feedback . Aim 2 : Evaluate effectiveness group medical visit microfinance CVD risk reduction . The effectiveness group medical visit microfinance group CVD risk reduction evaluate among individual diabetes increase risk diabetes , conduct four-arm cluster randomize trial . The primary outcome measure one-year change SBP , key secondary outcome measure change CVD risk score . Randomization occur level CU ( cluster ) , stratify Division . Each 32 CUs randomly allocate ( eight CUs per arm ) . Preliminary Data As , AMPATH 's CDM Program extensive network rural health facility deliver care diabetes hypertension . Although notable improvement clinical measure , nearly 60 % link care nearly 50 % remain care enrol . Women twice likely engage care men . The CDM Program pilot various form group care diabetes CVD risk factor determine group care feasible acceptable setting . The program implement diabetes self-management support group provide community-based peer support supplement health facility-based clinical care , education , counsel . These group include peer leader specific training , regularly schedule meeting member learn behavioral modification , self-management strategy , problem-solving approach . Analysis 148 subject three month reveal 76 % member attend group meeting least per month . Median hemoglobin A1C improve 9.6 % 9.1 % , significant change BP , body-mass index , waist circumference . The CDM Program Safety Net Program also collaborate integrate microfinance group group medical visit , demonstrate feasibility integrate approach . One-year result preliminary work ( BIGPIC Pilot ) available appear promising . Six integrate group newly form comprise 160 member , 90 ( 50 % ) patient diabetes hypertension . More woman attend initial screening ( 72 % ) , therefore over-represented . After invitation create integrate group medical visit- microfinance group , woman slightly likely participate men ( 83 % vs. 74 % ) . Linkage , retention , change SBP compare usual care vs. BIGPIC Pilot . Model Care Linkage care Retention care ∆ SBP 1 year Usual Care 42 % 50 % - 9.3 mmHg BIGPIC Pilot 66 % 66 % - 21.0 mmHg At one year , member accumulate deposit total $ 7,500 , social fund $ 1150 . The loan repayment rate 97.8 % . Progress Poverty Index mean score increase 36 44 , addition economic indicator . Table 1 provide summary linkage , retention , SBP change , compare usual care BIGPIC Pilot . In year 2 , membership increase 86.9 % , indicative favorable response community . Participants Within CU , AMPATH initiate home-based test community-level screen glucose BP , plan cover one-third CU 's population every year . Adult individual elevate BP ( SBP ≥ 140 diastolic BP ( DBP ) ≥ 90 ) elevate random blood glucose ( ≥ 8.1 mmol/L ) assign unique AMPATH Medical Record System identification number refer local rural health facility evaluation confirmation disease status . At health facility , individual repeat BP fast glucose measure , meet designated cutoff ( repeat SBP ≥ 140 DBP ≥ 90 ; fast glucose ≥ 7 mmol/L ) enter CDM Program .</detailed_description>
