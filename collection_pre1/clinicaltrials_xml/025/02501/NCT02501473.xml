	<brief_summary>This Phase 1/2 open label trial G100 patient low grade NHL . G100 compose glucopranosyl lipid A stable emulsion potent TLR4 ( toll-like receptor-4 ) agonist . G100 administer direct injection ( intratumorally ) tumor low grade NHL follow standard low dose radiation therapy . Preclinical model clinical study cancer Merkel cell carcinoma demonstrate G100 administer manner alter tumor microenvironment , activate dendritic cell , T cell immune cell induce systemic anti-tumor immune response . In trial , safety , immunogenicity , clinical efficacy G100 examine alone pembrolizumab .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This multi-center Phase 1/2 open label trial intratumoral G100 patient low grade NHL . Patients NHL treat local radiation enrol receive G100 accessable tumor mass . Clinical response evaluate injected lesion systemic ( abscopal ) response evaluate distal area involve tumor . The study conduct 3 part . In Part 1 , Dose Escalation , 2 sequentially enrolled cohort patient treat one 2 dose level G100 use standard escalation design . In portion study , follicular marginal zone NHL eligible . In Part 2 , 2 group patient follicular NHL may examine . One group randomly assign receive either single agent G100 intratumorally maximum safe dose determine Part 1 follow local radiation receive treatment regimen sequentially administer pembrolizumab . A second treatment group may explore safety profile Part 1 acceptable . In optional group , patient injectable tumor 4 cm great would enrol treat high dose G100 . In Part 3 , G100 Expansion high dose patient follicular NHL enrol receive local radiation therapy intratumoral G100 . The primary goal study determine safety tolerability different dos G100 administer intratumoral injection . The development anti-tumor immune response preliminary evidence clinical response local distal tumor site also examine .</detailed_description>
