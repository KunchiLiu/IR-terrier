	<brief_summary>Crohn 's disease ( CD ) chronic gastrointestinal inflammatory disease characterize relapse progression . The incidence prevalence IBD increase different region around world , indicate emergence global disease . Though modern medical therapy include immunomodulators biologic agent revolutionize treatment CD , occurrence steroids-dependence resistance intolerance medical therapy quite common . The limitation present therapeutic management high expense biologic agent lead treatment CD become `` refractoriness '' . The occurrence rate steroids-dependence resistance intolerance thiopurine therapy quite high course CD . Approximately 38 % case require surgery within 10 year . Therefore , management refractory CD remain great therapeutic challenge clinician . Thalidomide oral agent immunomodulatory , antiangiogenic TNF ( tumor necrosis factor ) -a- suppress effect . The potential role thalidomide treatment refractory paediatric adult CD investigate small open-label study retrospective case series . Recently , randomize control trial show thalidomide improved clinical remission 8 week treatment longer-term maintenance remission pediatric refractory CD . Gerich et al report retrospective study thalidomide improve long-term outcome among 37 refractory CD adult follow median 58 month . However , dose thalidomide use study range 50mg/d 150mg/d , occurrence rate side effect report variously quite high . The side effect relate dose thalidomide major concern use CD . Moreover , effect thalidomide endoscopic response include mucosal heal objective important outcome CD rarely report . Therefore aim study investigate efficacy clinical endoscopic response adverse effect use low-dose thalidomide active adult CD patient .</brief_summary>
