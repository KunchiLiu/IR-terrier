	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study transrectal magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) -guided biopsy see well work identify cancer patient suspect prostate cancer schedule undergo standard biopsy . Transrectal MRI-guided biopsy use thin needle insert rectum prostate take sample tissue , guide MRI . MRI use magnet take picture prostate may able identify cancer . Transrectal MRI-guided biopsy may accurate cause patient less pain standard ultrasound-guided biopsy . It yet know whether transrectal MRI-guided biopsy effective ultrasound-guided biopsy identify prostate cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To improve treatment patient prostate cancer utilize diagnostic multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) MRI-guided prostate biopsy combine molecular clinical data help determine extent prostate cancer risk disease progression . II . To determine relative accuracy transrectal MRI-guided versus ultrasound-guided biopsy diagnosis prostate cancer patient appropriate dominant target lesion multiparametric MRI , use pooled cancer diagnose either MRI-guided ultrasound-guided biopsy reference standard . III . To determine proportion positive transrectal MRI-guided biopsy demonstrate high Gleason score contemporaneous transrectal ultrasound guide biopsy . IV . To determine management impact transrectal MRI-targeted biopsy result compare transrectal ultrasound ( TRUS ) -guided systematic biopsy result . OUTLINE : Patients receive gadodiamide intravenously ( IV ) undergo diagnostic multiparametric endorectal MRI . Patients lesion visible diagnostic multiparametric endorectal MRI undergo transrectal MRI-guided biopsy within 2 week diagnostic multiparametric endorectal MRI . Patients undergo TRUS-guided biopsy per standard clinical care approximately 2 week transrectal MRI-guided biopsy .</detailed_description>
