	<brief_title>Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Trial RandOmizing Heparin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective study investigate safety clinical effect continuous low-dose intravenous unfractionated heparin ( LDIVH ) infusion prevention aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage ( aSAH ) induce neurocognitive dysfunction delay neurological deficit . Additionally , increase blood CSF level certain inflammatory biomarkers ( IL-6 , hsCRP , etc ) correlate aSAH patient poor clinical outcome . Unfractionated heparin ( UFH ) know anti-inflammatory action . As result , secondary objective study evaluate whether LDIVH reduce blood CSF inflammatory biomarkers level compare control whether association inflammatory biomarker level cognitive outcomes aSAH .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Age ≥ 18 ≤ 70 year 2 . Historical modify Rankin Scale Score 01 3 . WFNS SAH Scale grade ≤ 2 , due spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage attributable ruptured cerebral aneurysm . Cranial nerve deficit ( e.g . CN III paresis ) permissible even WFNS grade 2 . • Initial WFNS grade may determine admission enrollment , preferably patient 's mental status optimize resuscitation interval treatment hydrocephalus ( i.e. , placement intraventricular catheter ) reversal/wearingoff sedate medication use commonly patient transfer transport procedure relate anesthesia . 4 . Admission head CT showing modify Fisher grade 3 aSAH primarily supratentorial space . Snapshot image four relevant axial cut admission head CT need upload via image database confirm modify Fisher grade 3 eligibility potential subject prior enrollment . Minimal intraventricular hemorrhage acceptable . The Modified Fisher CT rating scale : Grade 1 ( minimal diffuse thing SAH without IVH ) ; Grade 2 ( minimal thin SAH IVH ) , Grade 3 ( thick cisternal clot without IVH ) , Grade 4 ( thick cisternal clot IVH ) [ From : Claassen J et al . Effect cisternal ventricular blood risk delay cerebral ischemia subarachnoid hemorrhage : Fisher scale revisit . Stroke 2001 ; 32:20122020 . ] 5 . Location pattern SAH must majority SAH supratentorial space cause either intradural anterior circulation aneurysm OR basilar apex posterior circulation aneurysm primarily supratentorial hemorrhage extension . Angiographic location aneurysm confirm catheter digital subtraction angiography ( DSA ) usually obtain coil embolization procedure . Patients PICA posterior circulation aneurysm cause SAH exclude . 6 . Onset symptom aSAH ( ictus ) occur &lt; 24 hour prior presentation treat facility . 7 . Initiation aneurysm securement procedure occur &lt; 48 hour ictus AND le 36 hour admission treat facility . • In patient exact time ictus uncertain , estimated time ictus may assign time use inclusion criterion assume estimation deem reasonably reliable [ i.e. , actual time highly likely within 6 hour estimate time ] . 8 . All aneurysm ( ) suspect responsible hemorrhage potentially responsible hemorrhage must secure follow manner prior enrollment : • Endovascular Coil Embolization postembolization RaymondRoy Score 1 ( Complete ) 2 ( Residual Neck ) 9 . Ability screen patient obtain head CT 212 hour completion coil procedure ability initiate study drug 12 ± 4 hour completion aneurysm coil procedure.. 10 . After recover anesthesia follow aneurysm coil procedure , patient must remain WFNS SAH grade ≤ 2 without evidence significant new focal neurological deficit include monoparesis / monoplegia , hemiparesis / hemiplegia , receptive , expressive global aphasia . New minor cranial nerve defect without new finding permissible . If NIHSS score obtain prior aneurysm coil procedure , postcoiling ( preenrollment ) NIHSS score must increase ≥ 4 point GCS score must decrease ≤ 2 point . The clinician local site use best clinical judgment whether significant neurological decline occur due procedure . 11 . Patient willing able return study followup visit . 12 . Patient Legally Authorized Representative ( LAR ) provide write informed consent . 1 . Angionegative SAH . 2 . A likely hemorrhage event within several day prior admission related hemorrhage ictus due increase risk early vasospasm . Prior sentinel headache negative CT prior sentinel headache patient seek medical attention exclude patient . 3 . Surgical clipping rupture aneurysm nonruptured aneurysm admission prior enrollment . 4 . SAH cause aneurysm rupture aneurysm identify traumatic , mycotic , blister fusiform type catheter DSA . 5 . Any intracranial stent placement noncoil intraaneurysmal device ( i.e. , stent assist coil Neuroform , Enterprise , LVIS , LVIS Jr , Barrel Stent , Pulse Rider , WEB , LUNA , Medina similar device ) stent device implant treat rupture aneurysm / antiplatelet therapy need . 6 . Patient remain aneurysm ( ) untreated could reasonably consider possible alternate cause aSAH base observe bleeding pattern . Adequate treatment aneurysm coil embolization would result aneurysms longer cause exclusion . MRI may use situation determine associate aneurysms rupture base lack blood see adjacent additional aneurysm . 7 . Femoral arteriotomy stick inferior epigastric artery OR angiographic , CT , clinical evidence arteriotomy related retroperitoneal hematoma large flank hematoma . A stable groin hematoma exclusion . 8 . Patient receive heparin form within last 100 day prior admission ( include coil procedure ) . 9 . Thrombocytopenia ( platelet count le 100,000 assume clump rule cause ) , confirm active disseminate intravascular coagulation ( DIC ) time enrollment OR document history coagulopathy bleed diathesis . 10 . Diagnosis sepsis ( SIRS criterion plus presence know suspected infection ) current document active bacterial viral infection prior enrollment ( Example : significant URI , communityacquired pneumonia ) . A minor non complicate communityaquired urinary tract infection would exclusion treat promptly . 11 . New parenchymal hemorrhage new infarction large 15cc volume , significant increase mass effect see post coil preenrollment head CT compare baseline admission head CT. New hyyperdensity CT scan relate contrast stain exclusion . 12 . Patient document history heparin induce thrombocytopenia ( HIT ) 13 . Patient develop SAHinduced cardiac stun prior enrollment , ejection fraction &lt; 40 % , require IV medicaitons blood pressure maintenance . 14 . Preadmission daily antiplatelet therapy oral subcutaneous anticoagulation therapy prior , coil embolization procedure . A single 325 mg Aspirin ( low dose ) give duiring coil embolization periprocedural period acceptable local standard care , document . 15 . Thrombolytic therapy within 24 hour prior enrollment ( rtPA , urokinase , etc . ) 16 . Plan antiplatelet oral anticoagulation therapy time coil embolization procedure 14 full day enrollment . Antiplatelet therapy may resume 14day window . 17 . Concurrent significant intracranial pathology identify prior enrollment , include limited , Moyamoya disease , high suspicion document CNS vasculitis , severe fibromuscular dysplasia , arteriovenous malformation , arteriovenous fistula , significant cervical intracranial atherosclerotic stenotic disease ( ≥70 % ) , malignant brain tumor . 18 .

Known seizure epilepsy disorder ( diagnosed prior aSAH diagnosis ) antiepileptic medication previously take patient recommend take patient . Childhood seizures resolve longer require treatment part exclusion criterion 20 . Serious comorbidities could confound study result include limited : Multiple Sclerosis , dementia , severe major depression , cancer likely cause death 2 year , multisystem organ failure , condition could cause degree cognitive impairment . 21 . Immunosuppression therapy include chronic corticosteroid usage . 22 . Remote history previous rupture cerebral aneurysm . 23 . History gastrointestinal hemorrhage major systemic hemorrhage within 30 day , hemoglobin le 8 g/dL , INR ≥1.5 , severe liver impairment ( AST &lt; ALT &lt; AP &lt; GGT &gt; 2 x normal cirrhosis ) , creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dL , estimate GFR &lt; 60 ml/min . 24 .
