	<brief_title>Echocardiography RILI Prediction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Severe radiation-induced lung injury ( RILI ) occur approximately 20 % lung cancer patient , treat curative chemoradiation ( CRT ) .This side-effect heavily impact quality life dose-limiting factor treatment . Identifying high risk patient start treatment would make possible adapt treatment choose another radiation technique proton therapy . However , despite fact many patient treatment characteristic associate RILI , possible accurately predict risk RILI individual patient . Recently , show radiation dose heart risk factor lung toxicity animal clinical study . Also , study , carry jointly CARIM GROW , find patient previous diagnosis cardiac disease significantly high risk develop RILI CRT ( p-value &lt; 0.001 ) , even low radiation dose heart . It unknown whether asymptomatic cardiac comorbidity also relate development RILI . Taking account approximately 30 % lung cancer patient suffer symptomatic cardiac comorbidity start cancer treatment , urgent need research project focus cardio-oncology . These project make possible unravel complex relationship heart , lung , chemotherapy radiation treatment . In current project investigator hypothesize biomarkers base echocardiography , reflect cardiac function , prognostic development radiation induce lung injury chemoradiotherapy . In addition , investigator validate previous find presence cardiac comorbidity associate RILI .</detailed_description>
