	<brief_summary>This study investigate whether walnut help promote weight loss , associate increase meal satiety satisfaction , 100 overweight obese men woman participate 6-month behavioral weight loss intervention . Participants randomly assign walnut-enriched reduced-calorie diet standard reduced-calorie diet . Body weight , risk factor cardiovascular disease , self-reported feeling relevant satiety appetite measure baseline 3- 6-month follow-up . Also , response gastrointestinal tract hormone follow meal without walnut measure subset study participant ( n=20 ) . Results study contribute understanding role nut weight control , include knowledge mechanism , expand knowledge nut diet may contribute prevention management obesity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Epidemiological study link regular consumption nut low body mass index reduce likelihood weight gain adulthood . Several mechanism propose explain nut may facilitate weight management , include high satiety property may promote dietary compensation reduce subsequent energy intake . Although propose possible mediating factor , satiety satiation relation nut nut-containing meal examine previous study . The effect nut consumption context weight loss intervention examine five previously-published randomized study , test effect almond , pistachio peanut ( walnut ) mixed result . This project study investigate effect walnut-enriched vs. standard reduced-energy diet body weight satiety via pre- post-meal rating scale , well explore response satiety- appetite-related gastrointestinal peptide meal without walnut sample subset . The specific aim study : 1 . To compare effect walnut-enriched reduced-energy diet standard reduced-energy diet body weight cardiovascular disease risk factor sample overweight obese adult intensive 6-month weight loss intervention . 2 . To examine whether differential response satiety- appetite-related rating scale association walnut-enriched reduced-energy diet standard reduced-energy diet among participant weight-loss study . 3 . To examine response satiety- appetite-related gastrointestinal peptide ( ghrelin , cholecystokinin , glucagon-like peptide , peptide YY ) , meal without walnut sample subset , exploratory aim . The first two aim address randomize control study involve 100 overweight obese men woman assign walnut-enriched reduced-energy diet standard reduced-energy diet context 6-month intensive weight loss intervention . Subjective satiety- appetite-related rating collect specific interval lunch dinner use visual analogue scale . Postprandial gastrointestinal peptide response meal without walnut , third exploratory aim , measure subset study participant ( n=20 ) use within-subject crossover study design . The investigator hypothesize participant assign walnut-enriched diet study arm great weight loss overall good improvement cardiovascular disease risk factor , rating hunger , fullness , anticipate prospective consumption differ participant assign standard reduced-energy diet . The investigator hypothesize postprandial satiety- appetite-related gastrointestinal peptide , play role short-term control appetite may biomarkers satiety , may differ response different isocaloric meal composition . Results study contribute understanding role nut weight control , include knowledge explanatory mechanism , expand knowledge nut diet may contribute prevention management obesity .</detailed_description>
