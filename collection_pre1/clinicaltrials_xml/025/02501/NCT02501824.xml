	<brief_title>Effectiveness Anthroposophic Speech Therapy Patients With Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Breathing retrain technique receive increase attention management asthma , since evidence safety usefulness procedure grow . Physiotherapist-guided breathing program , Papworth method Buteyko method , systematically investigate hence yield best evidence effectiveness . Active breathe modulation technique frequently assign complementary alternative medicine CAM , comprise variety system modality politically dominant healthcare system . However , patient may take different perspective , since prevalence CAM use treatment asthma level 20-30 % among adult 50 - 60 % child , even rigorous estimate apply . Anthroposophic therapeutic speech applies sound syllabic rhythm , e.g . hexameter , improve articulation , breathe cardiorespiratory interaction . The method use many year breathe retrain method asthma setting . This study first systematically investigate effect ATS asthma patient real-life outpatient setting . Objective The following hypothesis test : ) anthroposophic therapeutic speech improve relevant parameter pulmonary function patient asthma . ii ) anthroposophic therapeutic speech reduces use as-needed medication patient asthma . iii ) anthroposophic therapeutic speech improve asthma control quality life patient asthma . Methods The study randomise , control , multicentre , 2-period cross-over clinical trial conduct 3 centre Switzerland Germany . Participants randomly assign 1:1 allocation ratio either firstly receive 11 speech therapy session wait ( control ) , follow cross-over group .</detailed_description>
