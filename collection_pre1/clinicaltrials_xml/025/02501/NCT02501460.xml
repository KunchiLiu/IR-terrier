	<brief_summary>This study conduct low lean muscle mass prevalent among childhood cancer survivor . Lean muscle non-fatty muscle tissue make part body 's lean body mass . Low lean muscle mass associate loss overall body strength , decline mobility eventually , loss independence . Among childhood cancer survivor , low lean muscle mass may contribute reduced physical functioning sense fatigue exertion , limit ability participate adequate physical activity . Loss strength sense fatigue repeat movement make difficult participate daily activity . Although exercise intervention study among childhood cancer survivor specifically design evaluate effect resistance training muscle mass , study among individual chronic disease , include survivor adult onset cancer , indicate resistance exercise improve muscle mass , muscle strength , mobility , vitality physical activity level . Resistance training ( weight lift ) form physical activity design improve muscular fitness exercise muscle muscle group external resistance . The purpose study evaluate effect resistance training combine either protein supplement sport drink change lean muscle mass young adult treat childhood cancer . The sport drink , study , consider placebo .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This double-blind placebo control study randomize adult survivor childhood cancer 18 44 year age , great ten year post first cancer diagnosis , low lean muscle mass two group : Resistance Training + Supplement ( RT+S ) Resistance Training + Placebo ( RT+P ) . Randomization stratify sex age ( 18-29 30-44 year ) block size 4 . Three weekly resistance training session occur 24 week period . The participant , investigator , trainer individual involve test blind group assignment . Participants receive information physical activity health benefit . They randomly assign one two group receive individually tailor resistance training three time per week 24 week . One group receive protein supplement , group receive sport drink ( placebo ) . To assess outcome , participant follow research test : - Blood drawn assess heart health . - Questionnaires complete assess physical activity health well food intake . - Blood pressure measurement . - Electrocardiogram assess heart health . - Height , weight , waist hip measurement . - Lean muscle mass measure dual x-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA scan ) . - Muscle strength measure handgrip , knee extension , ankle dorsiflexion . - Walking speed determine usual walk speed . - Six-minute walk test determine endurance . - Physical activity monitor participant complete survey wear small record device ( accelerometer ) seven day . Study Objectives : - To evaluate effect 24-week supervise RT+S compare RT+P change lean muscle mass , muscle strength , walk speed , self-reported exhaustion physical activity level among childhood cancer survivor . - To evaluate effect 24-week supervise RT+S compare RT+P change blood pressure , high density lipoprotein , triglyceride , abdominal obesity , fast glucose , fast insulin , C-reactive protein among childhood cancer survivor .</detailed_description>
