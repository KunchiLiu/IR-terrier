	<brief_summary>Drawing vertical surface , blackboard ( rather horizontal surface ) often use occupational therapist way develop fine motor control visual motor integration child . While anecdotal evidence support intervention , preliminary result healthy child show difference graphical quality draw vertical horizontal surface . This however investigated child graphomotor impairment . The goal study determine whether movement produce vertical surface differ performance level muscle activation pattern compare movement produce horizontal surface . The investigator predict level performance vertical surface exceed level performance horizontal surface . Additionally , investigator hypothesize proximal muscle activate fatigue ( longer task ) draw vertical surface , distal muscle activate fatigued draw horizontal surface .</brief_summary>
