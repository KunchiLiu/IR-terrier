	<detailed_description>Cortical spreading depolarization ( CSD ) massive event recently observe many type acute brain injury likely lead expansion injury . These `` brain tsunami '' unlike type brain electrical event ( seizures normal neuronal transmission ) progress slowly across surface brain ( 2-5mm/minute ) involve near complete depolarization neuron cell . The similar event neurophysiology anoxic depolarization , final wave loss cell function precede death cell suffer severe , irreversible hypoxia ischemia ( 1 ) . In case CSD , cell able recover function , however , enormous metabolic expense . Massive amount energy substrate ( ATP , glucose , oxygen ) well delivery system bring substrate ( blood flow ) require restore normal ionic gradient cell membrane cell function . Because loss function cell , normal electrocortical ( ECog ) activity transiently lose , result depression high frequency cortical activity , phenomenon also frequently refer `` cortical spreading depression . '' CSD definitively document occur many type acute brain injury include ischemic stroke , aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage , intracerebral hemorrhage , severe traumatic brain injury ( 2,3 ) . The true incidence , time , unknown , measurement technique require placement small cortical electrode time surgical procedure . This limit region measurement relatively small area patient undergoing surgery , however even small sample , incidence delay SD brain injury range 53-88 % ( 4 ) . Efforts underway attempt measure CSD less invasively ( 5 ) non-invasively ( 6,7 ) , however technique currently exploration robust reliability cortical electrode system . Mounting human data couple extensive animal data support assertion CSD marker response severe brain injury , fact , play causal role injury propagation ( 8 ) . Animal data fairly definitive assertion , CSD study uninjured brain induce CSD lead neuronal death , particularly repeat event . Note progressive loss brain electrical activity repeat CSD figure right . In animal model , CSD clearly lead expansion injury , particularly ischemic stroke model . Human data unavoidably observational point , however observe multiple physiologic modality , deleterious effect become clear . A spectrum local blood flow response CSD observe , range wave hyperemia ( term normal hemodynamic response ) wave ischemia ( termed inverse hemodynamic response ( 9 , 10 ) ) . The factor determine response likely availability substrate ( glucose , oxygen ) delivery ( blood flow ) couple baseline metabolic state tissue ( depressed metabolic state may resistant ) . When inverse hemodynamic response observe , associate wave tissue hypoxia observe , become linearly hypoxic repeat CSD short interval ( 11 ) . Brain metabolism also measure CSD , consistent metabolic challenge note , increase micro dialysis lactate decrease glucose ( 12 ) . In case repeat event , glucose depletion become progressive due inadequate time tissue recover massive event lead progressive ischemia ( 12 ) . From clinical perspective , metabolic data support deleterious effect , effect clinical outcome critical determine event relevant potential target therapy . The occurrence severity CSD closely link development new stroke well clinical outcome retrospective prospective series . In subarachnoid hemorrhage , Dreier ( 13 ) report direct association clinical delay ischemic neurologic defect ( DIND ) presence cluster SD . Furthermore , small series , patient go develop stroke markedly longer period depression , indicate inability tissue recover event compare patient without delayed stroke . The extensive clinical outcome data traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) ( 14,15 ) presence CSD show non-significant trend toward predict bad outcome , however CSD occur already dysfunctional tissue ( term isoelectric spread depolarization ISD ) strong predictor clinical outcome composite score standard variable predict outcome ( OR 7.58 ( 95 % CI 2.64-21.8 ) ISD compare 1.76 ( 95 % CI 1.26-2.46 ) composite prognostic score ) ( 15 ) . This mount observational data deleterious effect CSD lead increase excitement regard CSD novel target prevention delay injury diverse type acute brain injury ( 16 ) . The optimal target agent define , promise animal data support wide variety agent , primarily target NMDAVR , think important factor propagation SD ( 17 ) . Initial clinical case report effect ketamine use sedation patient severe TBI ( 18 ) lead large scale effort retrospectively study various anesthetic use standard clinical care frequency CSD monitor patient ( 19 ) . Using sedation medication &gt; 1000 cumulative hour ECog record medication , effect propofol , fentanyl , midazolam , ketamine , morphine , sufentanyl examine . The study find consistent effect ketamine decrease probability CSD/h per patient . This nearly linearly dose dependent , importantly , multivariate analysis , ketamine still emerge significant effect decrease occurrence CSD well occurrence deleterious cluster CSD ( 19 ) . Though ongoing observational data still clearly need well characterize susceptibility effect CSD , order move toward trial CSD direct therapy , prospective trial effect ketamine occurrence CSD necessary confirm retrospective observation establish precedent future therapeutic trial . The SAKS trial provide important confirmatory pilot data direct implementation future trial . This prospective , randomize , control , multiple cross-over trial evaluate efficacy ketamine suppression CSDs . This multiple crossover design choose order able develop preliminary data could guide implementation future multicenter trial . Because significant variability patient , study randomized patient would subject large amount potential bias . Because factor time day hospital day also know affect CSD , brief crossover period 6 hour choose . The study register clinicaltrials.gov prior enrollment patient . Patients severe traumatic brain injury subarachnoid hemorrhage fit inclusion/exclusion criterion approach either research coordinator study investigator consent LAR study prior clinically indicated craniotomy . It expect patient able independently consent give severity condition , however , patient conscious , attempt make discus study well . The patient 's surgical procedure carry plan . The alteration surgical procedure placement subdural electrode strip ( 1x6 cortical strip : Integra : Plainsboro , NJ ) brain cortex adjacent operative site end procedure . These strip standard , FDA approve , disposable , pre-sterilized device use routinely epilepsy monitoring . In addition , investigator use strip part post-injury IRB approve protocol ( 10-159 ) many day surgery . The cortical strip ( plus dermal reference electrode mastoid apex skull ) monitor Moberg CNS monitor . ( Moberg Research , Ampler , PA ) .The Moberg monitor modify version standard clinical use multiparametric monitoring system show cleared FDA 2008 . The difference ECog amplifier , allow direct full frequency spectrum DC recording . Upon arrival , post-operatively , Neurosciences Intensive Care Unit , patient randomization complete via online randomization program . Randomization allocate patient either two group : 1 ) Ketamine first 2 ) Propofol/other first . No secondary randomization criterion think necessary give small sample size pilot trial . Initiation protocoled sedation regimen begin next hour divisible 6 ( i.e . 06:00 , 12:00 , 18:00 , 24:00 ) . The randomization determine sedative start , ketamine propofol/other infusion alternate every 6 hour schedule . Dosages sedate medication standardize , rather titrated clinical effect . The clinical effect determine attend intensivist base patient 's clinical need . This level sedation communicate nursing via Riker Sedation-Agitation Score ( 20 ) . A minimal dose ketamine ( 0.1mg/min 6mg/hr ) infuse ketamine period , low require induce sedation . No minimal sedation requirement exist propofol regimen period . This do test effect ketamine ( hypothesize affect frequency SD ) compare sedation regimen ( think affect SD . ) Each period adjustment sedation regimen treat `` spontaneous breathe trial '' common standard care procedure nurse involves hold sedation determine patient 's neurologic exam respiratory ability subsequent titration back appropriate clinical effect . These sedation break common ICU titration desire clinical effect perform appropriate drug per standard ICU nursing protocol . In event patient longer need invasive positive pressure ventilation prior discontinuation ] neuromonitoring , propofol/other sedation interval mandatory sedative infusion , however , ketamine interval basal dose 0.1mg/min ( 6mg/hr ) . 'The sedation protocol end strip remove . This determined patient critical care need . The strip check daily function well sign problem leak CSF . Once critical care monitor discontinue ( ventricular drain invasive monitoring ) strip remove . Other endpoint include sign CSF leak , adverse event report , treat intensivist think alternate sedation safe . During sedation protocol , cortical electroencephalographic monitoring cortical electrode continuously record . Other physiologic data obtain clinically ( include , limited , vital sign , arterial wave form , laboratory value , video EEG ) subject review data collection correlation occurrence SD . This data obtain part standard care store departmental server anonymous fashion . Clinical video EEG obtain majority patient ( patient ) part standard multimodal monitoring . This video review look external stimulus might induce cortical spreading depression .</detailed_description>
