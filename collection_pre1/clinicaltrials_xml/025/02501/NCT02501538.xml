	<brief_summary>This pilot study . The investigator plan cohort study 10 patient diabetic foot ulcer ( DFU ) . Study duration three week . Patients consent undergo debridement standard care day 0 . Ankle-Brachial Index ( ABI ) , Monofilament Sensory Test Vibration Perception Threshold ( VPT ) test perform day 0 . Tissue sample take visit standard care wound debridement tissue sample wound would normally remove part routine debridement . These tissue sample wind use gene expression bacterial analysis ( research ) . The patient receive topical oxygen therapy use TransCu O2 device ( research ) moist wound dressing 21 day . Moist wound dressing use standard care . Treatment initiated Screening/Baseline visit ( day 0 ) routine wound debridement , patient receive instruction home use device . The patient see routine wound debridement day 7 , 14 , 21 study window 5 days. , Digital photo wound , acetate trace wound vascular evaluation ( SensiLase , Transcutaneous oxygen measurement , Hyperspectral image ) perform study visit ( research ) .Tissue sample take standard care wound debridement every study visit . Results data analysis project use inform design large randomized clinical trial .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients see UT Southwestern Wound Clinic diabetic foot wound identify , consent , screen study . Upon sign consent , patient assign unique screen number . The screening number give first patient 001 increase sequentially subject screen . Screened subject enter onto screen log . Once number assign re-assigned another subject . At Day 0 , vascular evaluation include ABI , SensiLase , Transcutaneous oxygen measurement , hyperspectral image performed.Monofilament Sensory Test Vibration Perception Threshold ( VPT ) test also perform day 0.Patients undergo standard care wound debridement . Tissue sample take routinely standard care . A wound assessment perform , include debridement standard care , wound measurement , digital photo . Gene expression bacterial analysis perform tissue sample . After test perform , patient receive topical oxygen therapy use TransCu O2 device moist wound dressing . Moist wound dressing use standard care . Patient receive instruction continue treatment home . Patient return appointment day 7 , 14 , 21 , vascular assessment ( SensiLase , Transcutaneous oxygen measurement , Hyperspectral image ) , wound assessment ( wound measurement , digital photo acetate tracing ) tissue sample perform follow standard care debridement , Patient cease topical oxygen treatment day 21 , study conclude .</detailed_description>
