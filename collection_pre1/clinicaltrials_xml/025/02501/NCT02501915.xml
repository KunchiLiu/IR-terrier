	<brief_summary>The Kinesio Taping ( KT ) method develop thirty year ago order cause sensory effect epidermis dermis , generate variety physiological effect system . Clinical effect well know level muscle , neurological system , injury , inflammation , edema , among physiological effect thus largely theoretical framework . Objectives : The aim study evaluate Electromyographic ( EMG ) , Electroencephalographic ( EEG ) , muscle temperature flexibility effect Rectus Femoral muscle KT application . Methods : This pilot study six subject divide two group , A B . Group A receive application KT muscle Origin Insertion group B Insertion Origin , group tap non-dominant limb dominant limb use control group . The first application conduct 0 % second 75 100 % tension . Evaluations perform first application , immediately 24 hour later . After last evaluation , withdrawn taping , evaluate without tap , reapplied 75 100 % rat voltage sequence . The sixth last review conduct 24 hour last application . Before every application specific vibration perform patellar tendon order trigger neurophysiological imbalance rectus femoral .</brief_summary>
