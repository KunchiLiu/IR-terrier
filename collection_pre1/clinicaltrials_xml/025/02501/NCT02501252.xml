	<brief_title>Effectiveness Acceptability Availing Skilled Birth Attendance ( SBA ) Services Through Community Reproductive Health Nurses ( CORN ) Household Level Rural Communities Ethiopia ; A Cluster Community Trial Gedeo Zone , SNNPR</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction Every year , 287,000 woman die pregnancy childbirth , 6.9 million child die reach fifth birthday . Almost death occur develop country mother , child newborns lack access basic health care . While child mortality rate decline recent decade , 19,000 mother still mourn loss child every day - unthinkable number heartbreak . This especially tragic since death could prevent modest cost . On hand , majority maternal newborn death cause complication condition could prevent effectively manage inexpensive , low-technology measure . Majority maternal new bear care death follow unskilled delivery attend home . A study conduct Basra reason report woman deliver home preferring home delivery show social support privacy predominant reason give 98.2 % woman home delivery present child . Fear intervention repeat examination hospital concern 71.9 % woman prefer home delivery . About 17.5 % unplanned home delivery result quick labor security situation allow transfer hospital . On hand , recent evidence illustrate maternal death reduce post midwife ( skilled attendant ) need skill , supervision , back-up . Evidences obtain Bangladesh 2004 suggest , programme create cadre skilled birth attendant home birth launched Government . Accordingly , task-shifting seem yield beneficial result important insight human resource plan safe motherhood country . Another similar study Ray AM impact maternal mortality intervention use traditional birth attendant village midwife show village midwife contribute positive programme outcome . The presence skilled provider childbirth immediate postpartum/newborn period single critical intervention save life woman newborns . The skilled provider assist normal delivery also manage stabilize refer complication ; critical intervention reduce maternal newborn mortality . The proportion woman deliver assistance skilled birth attendant one proxy indicator meet fifth MDG . In almost country health professional attend 80 % delivery , Maternal Mortality Rate ( MMR ) 200 per 100,000 live birth [ 11 ] . However , birth skilled attendance low Southern Asia ( 40 % ) SSA ( 47 % ) , two region greatest number maternal death . Though program address majority health problem grass root level , maternal child morbidity/ mortality rate nation still one high world . This mainly attributable competency level rural health extension worker provide cross-cutting maternity service top deep rooted cultural , social economic problem rural community . For example , recent study Tigray Region Ethiopia show even HEWs contribute substantially improvement woman 's utilization family Planning ( FP ) , ANC HIV test , contribution improvement health facility delivery , postnatal check use iodized salt seem insignificant . In addition doubt skill rural Health Extension Worker ( HEW ) , also expect discharge several additional role responsibility along maternity relate service . Moreover , able encourage attend skilled birth delivery service mother , rather expect identify problem refer next high level health facility inaccessible ( geographically , socially , economically ... etc ) rural community . This definitely impend good utilization modern maternity service . Current study finding Ethiopia show skilled delivery service utilization low . Only 13 % woman live birth precede five year 2011 survey assist skilled health worker 12 % deliver health facility although represent improvement 6.2 % 2000 . This rate low bound sub-Saharan Africa standard . Skilled assistance delivery estimate increase low pace 5.6 % per annuum , pace , proportion attend skilled worker predict 21 % 2015 . Multivariate analysis suggest rural woman , uneducated , poor less likely deliver health institution . ( 13 ) The major attributable reason identify geared towards level knowledge maternity service , cultural influence low perceive benefit service utilization . According study trend maternal health Ethiopia 2012 , Women deliver health facility ask reason . The Ethiopian Demographic Health Survey ( EDHS ) 2011 data reveal two outstanding reason `` necessary '' `` customary '' , report 61.4 % 29.6 % , respectively . These follow place far/lack transportation ( 14.4 % ) . Other reason report tiny portion woman . Only ( 2.1 % ) blame service cost reason deliver health facility . Notably , report reason follow similar pattern urban rural area . Strikingly , two-third urban woman deliver health facility say necessary 17 % say customary . Mothers ' reply `` necessary '' `` customary implies fact need someone closer . According finding couple study North West South-East Ethiopia , ( 60.9 % ) mother give brth home need close attention family member , 57.7 % say delivering home usual experience , 33.4 % say labor short/urgent , 21.6 % say problem go health facility , 14.0 % say influence family member reason give birth home . What , even number distribution health worker , particularly nurse , country make progressive improvement , country still far behind achieve maternal child health relate MDGs health service utilization rate far minimum set WHO paradox achievement . Therefore , learn stage novel , culturally sensitive socially acceptable strategy overcome shortcoming limitation fact must come place nation achieve MDGs health related Growth transformation plan . May avail SBA service community ( household ) level deployment Community Reproductive Health Nurses ( CORN ) Kebele ( small village level administrative unit Ethiopian government system ) level helpful fill majority gap overlook yet ? 2 . RESEARCH QUESTIONS - How effective availing Home base SBA service CORN increase birth attend skilled birth Attendants ? - What level acceptability avail Home base SBA service service provider , health service manager general community ( client ) ? - What add advantage deploy Skilled birth Attendants ( CORN ) provide SBA MNH service household level strengthen health extension program Ethiopia ? - What add advantage deploy Skilled Birth Attendants ( CORN ) improve SBA Reproductive Health ( RH ) service utilization ? 3 . OBJECTIVE General Objective : To evaluate effectiveness acceptability avail Home base Skilled Birth Attendance ( SBA ) Services Community Reproductive Health Nurses ( CORN ) rural community Ethiopia . Primary Specific Objective - To determine effect avail home base SBA service utilization - To examine programmatic socio-cultural acceptability home base delivery SBA service Secondary Objectives - To determine effect skilled Birth Attendants ( CORN ) RH service utilization . - To describe effect Skilled Birth Attendants ( CORN ) strengthen Ethiopian Rural Health Extension Program . 4 . METHODS Study design This study two arm ( pre-test , post test ) Cluster Randomized Controlled Community Trial conduct four phase . The two arm : Arm one : CORNs base health center train provide skilled birth attendance RH service demand household level outreach base . Arm two : CORNs base live community health post /kebele/ level provide SBA service either health post house hold level . Interventions first arm test effectiveness acceptability baseline finding . A baseline evaluation formative assessment use qualitative method also conduct document situation health service utilization socio-cultural barrier affect skilled birth attendance study site . This serve pretest data intervention control sit . By apply similar technique tool , post test data collect end study three arm . The main variable comparison pretest post test data coverage delivery attend SBAs two arm , CORNS use exist facility base service delivery . Data collect health institution community within study area . The difference pretest post test indicator within intervention arm measure effect intervention change SBA service uptake . Study Area period The study conduct three district Gedeo Zone , Southern Region Ethiopia population density 650 per Sq . Kms. , . The Region one nine Regions country make 20 % national population . Gedeo Zone one highly populated area Ethiopia Africa large . The Zonal town , Dilla , locate 365 92 Kms away national regional capital , Addis Ababa Hawassa respectively . Dilla University one public Universities Ethiopia situate study site . Currently University 12 faculty three Colleges include College Health Sciences Referral Hospital . The maternal health service coverage utilization Gedeo zone one low country ( 7 , 29 ) . This implementation study expect take around one half year time secure project grant terminal evaluation dissemination . In health institution ( health center health post ) , health record data SBA service coverage ( institutional delivery , ANC PNC ) check secondary source information . Primary data relation barrier facilitate factor collect use semi-structured questionnaire service provider . In-depth interview focus group discussion also conduct , among service provider , health service manager community separately get insight perception , barrier facilitator skilled birth attendance service well extent acceptability deploy CORN . Sample size sample procedure A cluster randomize community trial propose assess effectiveness deploy CORNs advance skilled birth attendance ( delivery ) . A previous Demographic health Survey ( DHS ) 2011 study show proportion subject assist delivery 4 % rural setting . According health sector development plan IV country , plan increase proportion assist delivery 18.4 % 62 % end 2014/15 fiscal year . Hence , pro-grammatically similar important difference 58 % expect deployment CORNs . Assuming Level significance = 5 % , Power = 80 % , Type test = two-sided Based stated assumption , initial sample size require per group 94 . To estimate sample size cluster randomize trial , need estimate degree cluster practice level , available previous randomize trial postnatal care . Using approach previous study , take inter-practice correlation coefficient 0.005 indicated trial , inflated sample size 2.45 time non-cluster randomized trial consider potential cluster design effect . This yield estimate sample size group 230 . Hence total sample size require two arm trial 460 . A sample size 460 household , 230 arm , sufficient detect clinically important difference 58 % group assist delivery deploy CORN use two-tailed z-test proportion two group 80 % power 5 % level significance . This 58 % difference represent 62 % assisted delivery CORNs 4 % assisted delivery without CORN routine standard community care . All secondary outcome yield sample size much low one state . Hence , sake sample adequacy , analysis carry primary secondary outcome , maximum sample size ( 490 ) consider . Study Participants Study participant All pregnant woman give birth home health facility ( include health post ) study period . Husbands , grandmother health worker ( qualitative formative assessment ) The Intervention The study conduct four phase . During first ( preparatory ) phase , sensitization relevant stakeholder recruitment trainee conduct . In second phase , formative baseline assessment well train CORNs take place . In third phase , actual intervention phase , deployment CORNs respective study site do final phase , final evaluation dissemination study finding do . The intention behind deploy CORNs grassroots level give backup skilled delivery Maternal Neonatal health ( MNH ) care service poor rural mother difficult access modern health facility various reason ; intention promote encourage home delivery replace institutional delivery . Perhaps help assimilate rural mother modern health facility . The detail activity phase discuss . 1 . Phase one : Preparatory phase At begin intervention , sensitization orientation workshop organize hold relevant regional zonal level health service manger concerned stakeholder purpose study . After another workshop also organize experienced relevant expert various capacity responsibility finalize curriculum trainee per predefined core competency intervention . With developed curriculum , train manual prepared recruitment candidate sooner commences . Selection candidate do market ( Unemployed nurse midwife ) health facility ( nurse work health center hospital , particularly maternal Child Health ( MCH ) unit ) . This do fact scale intervention , effect work experience quality success program might issue concern . It clear currently Ethiopia , excess number nurse trained government private college . Selection deployment cause shortage professional work place , rather create job opportunity many nurse graduate yet employ . How CORN Trainees Selected ? The selection candidate do mainly give intake exam ( practical theoretical ) check favorability complete training follow oral interview evaluate readiness willingness ( attitude ) provide community base service grass root level door door basis . It also help determine level candidate ' knowledge clinical skill . This do collaboration Dilla University Southern Regional Health Bureau . 2 . Phase two : Pre - Implementation Phase Having identify 16 suitable candidate ( await list , enrol actual intervention ) training , four month practice orient train give University 's Referral Hospital health facility ( health center ) Zone . The education CORN good quality pre-service in-service level system supportive supervision . The education CORN base `` Competency Model '' ( 18 ) . The International Confederation Midwives ( ICM ) competency model currently consider international standard provision skilled , safe , professional care childbearing woman family . This model form conceptual framework upon core skill ability Skilled Birth Attendant base reflect essential knowledge , skills behavior expect ante-partum , intra-partum , post-partum neonatal care . Hence , train CORN include critical component practical skill , problem solving , critical thinking skill decision making . These component think use large degree student center facilitation approach teach learning . After candidate successfully complete train acquire expect knowledge skill major core competency ; another workshop organize sensitization advocacy role CORN key influential people community ( political community leader , mother concerned body ) . In mean time , baseline survey conduct document coverage skilled birth attendance reproductive health service across arm study . Selection cluster study site identification also do time . Data Collection For baseline end line survey ( pre post test ) , relevant data : Socio-demographic characteristic , reproductive history , health seek behavior , health service utilization , socioeconomic socio-cultural factor affect health service utilization ..etc collect use appropriate data collection tool . The tool pretested 5 % study population size non-study area Gedeo zone . ETHICAL CONSIDERATION Though propose formative intervention study non -invasive nature , since strategy avail skilled birth attendant household level new initiative , may various ethical issue .</detailed_description>
