	<brief_summary>BACKGROUND : Central venous catheter ( CVC ) option hemodialysis need patient without definitive vascular access . However , CVC use associate complication infection , thrombosis , dysfunction , lead high mortality expenditure . The aim study compare effectiveness 30 % trisodium citrate ( TSC30 % ) heparin CVC lock solution prevent catheter-related bloodstream infection ( CRBSI ) dysfunction hemodialysis patient . METHODS : Randomized , double-blind control trial compare event-free survival non-tunneled CVC lock heparin TSC30 % adult hemodialysis patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparative Effectiveness 30 % TSC Heparin Lock Solution Hemodialysis Catheters</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>METHODS Study Design This double blind randomize control trial ( RCT ) conduct July 2012 July 2014 dialysis transplantation unit Brazilian university hospital . The patient randomly assign catheter lock either unfractionated sodium heparin 5000 U/mL 30 % trisodium citrate . The randomization perform computer-generated list random number block six . Patients investigator unaware treatment assignment . Allocation concealment perform use opaque , seal envelopes assignment . After hemodialysis ( HD ) session , patient assign 30 % TSC catheter lumen flush 0.9 % sodium chloride lock volume 30 % TSC solution equivalent catheter internal lumen . Patients assign heparin catheter lumen flush 0.9 % sodium chloride lock volume 5000 U/mL heparin equivalent CVC internal lumen . Catheter care accord international guideline , include strict asepsis insertion exit-site dressing change HD session staff wear mask sterile glove . SELECTION OF PATIENTS Patients eligible enrollment RCT old 18 year chronic acute renal failure require hemodialysis catheter . Patients admit intensive care ward , receive tunnel catheter , suspect heparin-induced thrombocytopenia , allergy heparin TSC30 % , systemic localize infection pregnant woman exclude . The site insertion specific type catheter decide interventionist physician . MAIN OUTCOMES Catheter relate bloodstream infection ( CRBSI ) : CRBSI define fever and/or chill dialysis session least one positive blood culture , obvious cause infection careful clinical examination . The management CRBSI perform accord guideline . Empirical antibiotic therapy immediately give . The catheter remove isolation S. aureus fungus , clinical recovery within 48 hour antibiotic treatment . Catheter dysfunction : Dysfunction define persistent inability obtain blood flow 200 mL/min . In situation , catheter remove exchanged guidewire . OTHER PREDICTORS Patients-related : Data also collect age , gender , skin color , presence diabetes , diagnosis CKD acute kidney injury , hemodialysis vintage . Catheter-related : Site insertion ( jugular , subclavian femoral vein ) , ordinal number catheter patient ( consider study period ) . STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Calculation require sample size base main outcome . It assume group heparin lock would rate catheter-related bloodstream infection 150 % great catheter TCS30 % lock . With two-sided test , alfa error 5 % 80 % power , require 112 catheter group . The primary analysis make survival analysis Cox proportional hazard regression . Initially investigator proceed univariate analysis use Kaplan-Meier curve log rank test categorical variable , univariate Cox regression continuous variable . The predictor p-value low 0.25 univariate analysis include final model . Interactions check possible association predictor . The likelihood ratio test use compare nest full model . The proportionality predictor verify introduction time-dependent variable model . If predictor violate proportionality assumption , analysis would stratify predictor . Well-functioning catheter end study period , catheter remove patient acquire functional arteriovenous fistula , renal function recovery , change peritoneal dialysis transplantation analyze censor data . The analysis do intention-to-treat base . All report p-value two side . The analysis perform use STATA 11.2 statistical software ( Stata Corporation , College Station , TX , USA ) ETHICAL ASPECTS The study protocol approve local review board . Written inform consent obtain patient enrollment .</detailed_description>
