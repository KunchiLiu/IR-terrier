	<detailed_description>Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) confer substantial risk mortality morbidity stroke thromboembolism , common cardiac arrhythmia represent major healthcare burden Europe . Stroke prevention central management AF patient , oral anticoagulation ( OAC ) use well-controlled adjust dose vitamin K antagonist novel OACs recommend patient AF ≥1 stroke risk factor . Also , 2012 focus update ESC guideline strongly advocate clinical practice shift initial decision step identification 'truly low risk ' patient , essentially age &lt; 65 without stroke risk factor ( male female ) , need antithrombotic therapy . The ESC guideline recommend use CHA2DS2-VASc score stroke risk assessment , 'low risk ' patient define CHA2DS2-VASc score=0 ( male ) score=1 ( female ) . Subsequent initial step identify low risk patient , effective stroke prevention ( essentially OAC ) offer AF patient ≥1 stroke risk factor , treatment decision make consultation patient incorporate preference . Despite recommendation , substantial number patient AF treat OAC . On hand , patient AF low risk `` overtreated '' , receive OAC despite CHADS-VASc score 0 . Therefore , registry determine , patient non-valvular AF treat ac-cording current guideline . Apixaban oral factor Xa inhibitor , test number indication . In AVERROES study patient non-valvular atrial fibrillation deem suitable treatment vitamin-K antagonist apixaban compare aspirin reduce incidence stroke systemic embolism without increase bleed complication . In large ARISTOTELE study apixaban superior warfarin , re-duced primary endpoint stroke systemic embolism cause less bleeding reduced all-cause mortality . Subsequently apixaban approve European health authority use patient atrial fibrillation . It therefore interest determine use apixaban real life respect patient selection , adherence therapy midterm efficacy safety .</detailed_description>
