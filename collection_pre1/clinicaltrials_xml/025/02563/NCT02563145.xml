	<brief_title>Real-time fMRI Treatment Aggressive Behavior Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study , part European research project MATRICS ( Multidisciplinary Approaches Translational Research ) , investigator focus test innovative , non-pharmacological therapeutic approach adolescent specific , difficult treat subtype aggressive behavior problem . Participants trained acquire control physiological parameter , case study activation certain brain area . While try control parameter , participant get direct continuous feedback physiological state change , reward successful manipulation . Biofeedback method currently use treat patient variety psychiatric disorder attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) . Here , real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging ( rt-fMRI ) feedback use , participant get feedback activation level pattern brain region associate emotion processing ( amygdala/insula ) almost real time lie magnetic resonance tomograph scanner . Investigators focus follow question concern effectiveness treatment approach : 1 . Can participant gain increase control activation define brain region real-time fMRI training ? 2 . Which short- long term consequence expect improved self control brain activation upon aggressive antisocial behavior problem ? Before training , participant undergo extensive pre-treatment assessment part characterization subtyping aggression within large multicenter subtyping study ( EU-Aggressotype EU-MATRICS ) . The assessment include clinical psychometric measure , neuropsychological testing , fMRI ( 3 active task + rest state ) , MRS ( anterior cingulate cortex ( ACC ) insula ) diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) well biosampling ( blood/saliva genetics/epigenetics/hormones ) . Comparison typically develop ( TD ) control group receive intervention allow interpret change term normalization compensation . After completion pretest , subject meet inclusion criterion rt-fMRI treatment study randomly assign two different treatment arm , either experimental fMRI real-time feedback condition comparator condition treatment usual ( TAU ) last 10 week . Subjects assign experimental condition receive 10 session ( 1/week ) real-time fMRI feedback amygdala and/or insula activation ( base activation pattern pre-training assessment ) . Each training last 1 1/2 hour consist 3 experimental block , include feedback- transfer trial . Video clip emotional aggressive interpersonal interaction partly use enrich feedback condition naturalistic , virtual reality type display . Heart rate electrodermal activity record simultaneously session . Subjects comparator TAU arm receive several session psychoeducation counsel parents/caregivers group train 10 week . After completion either train TAU , subject undergo post-treatment assessment , repeat teacher parent report behavioral measure , well neuropsychological testing , fMRI MRS. A follow-up assessment take place 6 month end treatment phase comprise parent teacher report behavioral measure .</detailed_description>
