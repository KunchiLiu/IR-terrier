	<brief_summary>Spine surgery prone position ( involve lie face ) associate various visual change , range temporary change acuity ( sharpness ) permanent blindness . Known risk factor include low blood count ( anemia ) long surgical time prone position general anesthesia . While blindness rare outcome surgery , devastate incompletely prevent control know risk factor . Thus , improve monitoring detection visual injury surgery necessary . The purpose study determine whether novel , non-invasive monitoring device reliably record visual response spine surgery . The first phase study complete involved patient undergo microdiscectomy surgery . The second phase study involve patient undergo single-level lumbar spine decompression/fusion surgery .</brief_summary>
