	<brief_summary>In project , investigator propose study jump different reduce gravity field obtain parabolic flight profile also increase gravity field obtain turn airplane pull-up phase parabola . By mean pneumatic device , additional pull-down force add vertical force cause gravity field . By combine different level gravity different level add pull-down force possible dissociate respective contribution otolithic proprioceptive system anticipatory landing response . To investigator ' knowledge , one study modify gravity field jump . However , author add pull-down force analyze vertical ground reaction force . A good knowledge sensory-motor control land phase jump also increase investigator ' understand physiopathology joint instability . Indeed , similarity could find evolution motor response due absence gravity long-duration space flight pathological process chronic ankle knee instability . The knowledge generate study thus provide invaluable information context human performance rehabilitation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Gravity Muscular Control Landing From Jump</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Investigations description -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- During experiment , subject jump different gravity field submit additional pull-down force equal 0-100 % body weight Earth . During takeoff landing phase jump , ground reaction force record force-platform , movement limb segment record mean high-speed camera electrical activity ( EMG ) main low limb muscle record mean surface electrode . Force platform Subject Loading System We develop device combine force platform subject jump Subject Loading System ( SLS ) pull subject downwards . The force platform 60 cm x 40 cm aluminum plate equip four force-transducers measure three component force exert subject 's foot ground . The SLS consist two pneumatic piston , attach harness one end aluminum plate . The SLS set generate force equal 20-100 % subject 's body weight Earth . A security handrail ( show picture ) attach aluminum plate , around force-platform case unbalance subject . EMG EMG record MyoSystem 1400L use surface electrode . The skin shave ( necessary ) electrodes attached double sided tape plaster . The electrode place level lateral gastrocnemius , medial gastrocnemius , tibialis anterior peroneus longus , thigh level vastus lateralis , vastus medialis lateral hamstring medial hamstring . There 2 electrode per muscle ( fixed one ) one reference electrode place level C7 vertebra . Manufacturer : Noraxon . Conformity certificate : CE 344 Video Movements subject record mean high-speed digital camera ( Basler ) . In order facilitate video analysis , 7 reflective marker ( hemisphere 12 mm diameter ) delimit body segment : 3 glue one shoe , 3 fix skin ( method use EMG electrode ) level ankle , knee , hip one limb last one fix neck . Experimental protocol Before flight subject familiarize setup protocol . For flight day , one subject study . The procedure follow 3 day . The experiment day start 7.30 a.m. test subject equip EMG electrode video marker . After take-off work permit , subject go experimental area equip SLS harness . Before parabola , subject stand beside platform adjust zero level sensor ( 3 second ) . Then subject step platform record weight ( 3 second ) . During hypergravity initial part parabola , subject stand two foot side platform . The traction system loose ( 5 kg traction ) . During injection , traction system start progressively pull downwards subject . The traction force tune 20 % 100 % body weight Earth . The traction force constant parabola . During 20 second weightlessness partial gravity , subject jump several time . At end parabola , subject put foot side platform traction system stop pull downwards pull phase . This experiment also perform period increase gravity obtain turn airplane . Three turn per flight perform 3 level gravity : 1.2 , 1.4 g 1.6 g. During parabola turn , one experimenter take care control traction system collection data , second one take care image acquisition , third one take care modification configuration harness parabola safety subject case unbalance parabola turn .</detailed_description>
