	<brief_title>Comparison Of Respiratory Support After Delivery Infants Born Before 28 Weeks Gestational Age</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study two arm randomise comparison two system ( T-piece device new system ) respiratory support delivery infant bear less 28 week gestational age ( GA ) . This multicentre trial start Karolinska University Hospital sit join throughout study period . The trial academic coordinating investigator sponsor . No company funding consider . The new device design neonatal resuscitation CE-marked intend use . The device operated/handled similar way exist device provide support accord resuscitation guideline . During spontaneous breathe continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) provide new system pressure stable low impose work breathing . The benefit decrease imposed work breathe resuscitation previously investigate . The new system option use prong patient interface . Prongs show promising result trial theoretical benefit . We hypothesis combine use prong low impose work breathing could reduce number infant need mechanical ventilation . Screening eligibility consent perform mother threaten delivery extremely premature infant ( &lt; 28 week gestational age ) . There low gestational age limit patient include decision intubate prior delivery treatment limitation . After patient enrol randomisation hold delivery imminent . Randomisation stratify centre , gestational age antenatal steroid treatment . The intervention blind . The management respiratory support accord international guideline detail description provide clinical management appendix . The intervention respiratory support first 10-30 minute life begin birth infant transfer resuscitation team . The intervention end 1 ) infant intubate ( primary outcome ) , 2 ) minimum 10 minute support , randomized system , patient stable breathing adequately , 3 ) 30 minute respiratory support continue decide clinician ( cross-over allow ) . Apart system use respiratory support patient receive standard care . No assessment investigation trial subject plan . Data report resuscitation team collect record . The primary outcome delivery room intubation death . The secondary outcome include time intubation , use surfactant , use positive pressure ventilation , respiratory support 72 hour temperature intensive care admission . Safety variable include pneumothorax , intraventricular haemorrhage problem ventilation equipment . All analysis intention treat p &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant . The primary outcome variable ( delivery room intubation death ) represent 2x2 cross table analyse Pearson chi-square test . The secondary outcome include Kaplan Meier analysis time intubation comparison mean continuous variable . There predetermined subgroup . Subgroup analysis use describe population generate hypothesis .</detailed_description>
