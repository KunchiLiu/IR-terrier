	<detailed_description>Investigations description Throughout experiment test subject safely attached fixation mechanism center gravity ( hip ) . This mechanism comprise climb harness connect two lateral vertical guide two magnetic connection plate level hip . The test subject lie floor plate equip foam pad create comfortable lie surface . This mechanism allow free postural movement microgravity phase also support test subjectÂ´s lie position 1,8g- phase . At stage experiment test subject able exit fixation alone , use one hand . The harness move vertically linear slide system spring vertical guide . Springs remain compressed 1g/2g-phase lift subject reduction microgravity . At begin weightlessness phase parabola , slide system push participant 's body 30cm floor . After reach free float position , ask perform short effort ( crouch stretch ) relax stay still . Once free floating , three video camera wide angle lens record body movement front , side top view . By electronically synchronize camera produce image use three-dimensional analysis . Additionally three-dimensional force sensor hip fixation use evaluate quality microgravity provide parabolic flight . Experimental protocol Before flight subject familiarize setup protocol . For flight day , 3 subject study . The procedure 3 subject 3 day . The subject rest calm bottom microgravity phase start . As described spring force linear slide system push body mass 300mm . After test subject reach free float position without contact surround area ( bottom ) , perform short effort ( crouch stretch ) . From subject relax allow move muscle intentionally . At end microgravity phase , slide system allow soft landing foam pad .</detailed_description>
