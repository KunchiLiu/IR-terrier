	<detailed_description>A Simon 2-stage single-arm design ( n=17 ) employ evaluate preliminary efficacy . A maximum 17 subject accrue efficacy arm . After first 3 patient enrol efficacy arm , 6 week enrollment hold conduct order ensure safety additional patient enrol . An interim assessment occur first 9 subject enrol , accrual arm proceed pre-specified futility threshold meet . Patients require continuation HER2 direct therapy , trastuzumab , enrol arm .</detailed_description>

Measurable nonCNS disease , define RECIST1.1 criterion Recovered toxicity associate prior treatment , acceptable baseline status grade 1 less ( lab toxicity see limit inclusion , ) , except toxicity consider safety risk , alopecia vitiligo . Peripheral neuropathy must grade 2 less Adequate organ marrow function , define : platelet ≥ 75x 103/μL ; absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1,000/μL ; hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL ; total bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN ( upper limit normal ) except subject document Gilbert 's syndrome ( ≤5 x ULN ) liver metastasis , must baseline total bilirubin ≤3.0 mg/dL ; AST ALT ≤ 3 x ULN , unless associate hepatobiliary metastasis , case ≤5 x ULN serum creatinine ≤ 2 mg/dL ( glomerular filtration rate ≥ 50 ml/min determine CockcroftGault equation ) ; Negative hepatitis B serologic test . If positive result indicative active chronic infection , subject enter study investigator 's discretion Females childbearing potential sexually active nonsterilized male partner must use highly effective method contraception prior first dose investigational product , must agree continue use precaution 6 month final dose investigational product ; cessation contraception point discuss responsible physician . Periodic abstinence , rhythm method , withdrawal method acceptable method contraception . They must also refrain egg cell donation 6 month final dose investigational product ; Females childbearing potential define surgically sterile ( ie , bilateral tubal ligation , bilateral oophorectomy , complete hysterectomy ) postmenopausal ( defined 12 month menses without alternative medical cause ) ; A highly effective method contraception define one result low failure rate ( i.e. , less 1 % per year ) use consistently correctly .

In addition , must refrain sperm donation 90 day final dose investigational product LVEF ≥50 % patient enrol HER2 direct therapy arm CNS complication urgent neurosurgical intervention indicate ( e.g. , resection , shunt placement ) Known leptomeningeal metastasis amenable radiotherapy .
