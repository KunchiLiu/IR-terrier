	<brief_summary>Hypertension one common cardiovascular disease , major risk factor stroke cardiovascular event . Accumulated data show target-organ damage relate 24-h mean intra-arterial BP , also BP variability ( BPV ) subject essential hypertension . There many study effect different kind drug blood pressure , clinical research impact antihypertensive drug BPV limit , conclusion still controversial . In addition , recent study find occurrence development hypertension , especially essential hypertension , closely related hyperuricemia . Serum UA independently prognostic indicator development hypertension . Some study observe effect different kind antihypertensive drug uric acid level hypertensive patient . After adjustment , calcium channel blocker associate low risk incident gout among people hypertension . However , effect alpha blocker uric acid plasma still clear . Therefore , perform study observe different effect alpha blocker calcium channel blocker blood pressure variability uric acid level hypertensive patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hypertension one common cardiovascular disease , major risk factor stroke cardiovascular event . Traditionally , cardiovascular risk stratification hypertensive patient base average blood pressure ( BP ) measure clinic . Accumulated data show target-organ damage relate 24-h mean intra-arterial BP , also BP variability ( BPV ) subject essential hypertension . Growing evidence demonstrate BPV considerable prognostic value all-cause mortality cardiovascular outcome , independent average BP . At present , normal range BPV clear . There many study effect different kind drug blood pressure , clinical research impact antihypertensive drug BPV limit , conclusion still controversial . In addition , recent study find occurrence development hypertension , especially essential hypertension , closely related hyperuricemia . Accumulated data show significant independent association uric acid level onset hypertension men woman participant . Serum UA independently prognostic indicator development hypertension . Some study observe effect different kind antihypertensive drug uric acid level hypertensive patient . After adjustment , diuretic , β blocker , angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor non-losartan angiotensin Ⅱ receptor antagonist associate increase risk gout . In contrast , calcium channel blocker losartan associate low risk incident gout among people hypertension . However , effect alpha blocker uric acid plasma still clear . Therefore , perform study observe different effect alpha blocker calcium channel blocker blood pressure variability uric acid level hypertensive patient .</detailed_description>
