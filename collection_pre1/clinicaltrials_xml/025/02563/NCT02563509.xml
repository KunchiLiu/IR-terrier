	<brief_title>Reconstitution HIV-specific Immunity Against HIV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The research aim establish new treatment strategy HIV . It significantly improve clinical therapy effect effectively reduce morbidity mortality reconstitute immune system HIV infect patient combine multiple therapy strategy . Therefore , research could develop clone amplification system immunocytes vitro , improve antiviral immune system severely damage transfuse clone cell modify specific HIV antigen . So HIV infect patient could discontinue traditional anti-viral drug , develop opportunistic infection , could obviously increase life quality patient .</detailed_description>
