	<brief_summary>This study do learn interaction alcohol consumption HIV brain function . The propose study two broad objective . The first incorporate functional neuroimaging ( FMRI ) approach , along additional Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy ( MRS ) method enable delineation functional cerebral metabolic disturbance affect specific functional brain system associate interaction ethanol ( ETOH ) consumption Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) -associated brain dysfunction . Recent data indicate HIV infect patient heavy ETOH consumption FMRI abnormalities exhibit alteration neuroimaging measure compare moderate drinker people drink . The second objective examine extent reduction ETOH consumption among heavy drinker HIV infection result motivational intervention . The finding study provide important information heavy ETOH HIV interact affect brain functional responsiveness , extent improvement might gain reduce heavy ETOH use .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In research study , participant randomize ( much like flip coin ) computer program either counsel FMRI baseline visit second session visit . Each time point ( baseline , 3 month 9 month ) consist 2 participant session . Session 1 ) baseline purpose recruit determine participant meet study criterion ; visit , study criterion review ensure enrolled participant still eligible . After determine eligibility , study information explain research assistant consent obtain . Additional psychiatric substance use assessment neurological perform . Blood urine specimen obtain send lab measurement immunological , virologic , hepatic status biomarkers . The remainder blood specimen freeze bank future analysis . All blood specimen bank future analysis deidentified . A neurocognitive assessment perform research assistant . The duration approximately 120 minute . Session 2 ) occur within one week visit one . It consist MRI scan lasting approximately 50 minute . Functional imaging conduct MRI time . All participant undergo procedure baseline , three nine month .</detailed_description>
