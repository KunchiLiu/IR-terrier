	<brief_title>The Operation Control Devices During Parabolic Flights : Influence Weightlessness , Stress Motivation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Investigations description -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Subjects sit rack table front 17 '' screen Eye Tracker system ( Tobii® T60 ) . The right part screen cover row operate device ; two rotary knob different size , one turn switch one simple push button . The construction device base real one board ISS . Integrated three device force sensor ( 6D ATI® Nano17 ) , register grip torque force subject ' manipulate device . Four Vicon® Bonita camera position table attached table-fixed metal frame . They register hand dynamic throughout grasp movement normal gravity well microgravity . In accordance classical control task Kramer ( 1999 ) subject ask control pointer instrument , display one screen . These control embed real life scenario subject react specific signal within scenario : As soon one display pointer reach critical deflection , subject react fast possible grasping towards associate control device , rotate push turn back start position . This action bring pointer back uncritical position . The pointer move independent others . Additionally introduce one compatible one incompatible pointer-device connection , i.e . upper pointer control low device , middle pointer middle low pointer upper device . Equipment use -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Hand movement Hand movement register side four infrared high-speed camera ( Bonita Vicon-Cameras - CE mark 0088 ) register 250Hz 3D position ten small reflexive marker ( attach double sided adhesive tape fingertips thumb subject ' right hand ) . The camera connect via cable Ultranet central processing unit . The Ultranet connect network cable correspond desktop computer . Force torque sensors The different knob ( three ) grasp , measure force torque apply rate 250Hz . These sensor ( Nano 17 ATI DAQ F/T System ) connect power supply box booster , supply data via DAQ card desktop computer . We analyze usual force parameter initial force knob , also maximal force apply knob . Experimental protocol -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Before flight subject familiarize setup protocol . For flight day , one subject study . The procedure flight . Overall one subject test 26 parabola . Within first 13 parabolas motivational state manipulate positive way mean positive word presentation ( subliminal priming ) within last 13 parabola negative word . The order positive versus negative priming counterbalance across subject . All subject perform task operate control device level flight first parabola , parabolas parabola . After whole flight subject perform control task .</detailed_description>
