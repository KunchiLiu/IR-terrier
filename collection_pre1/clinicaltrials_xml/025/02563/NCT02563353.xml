	<brief_summary>Objective : This randomize control trial ( RCT ) osteoporosis patient randomized standard parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) treatment alone standard PTH treatment Whole-body vibration ( WBV ) . PTH effective expensive anabolic treatment osteoporosis . WBV stimulate muscle bone . A combined treatment might synergistic additive beneficial effect bone , reduce fracture risk make treatment effective cost-effective . A beneficial effect muscle thereby fall risk WBV may improve fracture risk even . If result pilot study promising strong case make large multi-centre RCT use strong endpoint include fracture fall .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Objectives 1 . To determine WBV addition standard PTH treatment great effect bone mass osteoporosis patient compare standard PTH treatment alone . 2 . To determine WBV addition standard PTH treatment great effect bone microarchitecture osteoporosis patient compare standard PTH treatment alone , assess high resolution peripheral quantitative compute tomography ( HR-pQCT ) . 3 . To determine WBV addition standard PTH treatment great effect marker bone formation resorption osteoporosis patient compare standard PTH treatment alone . 4 . To study effect WBV muscle function balance osteoporosis 5 . To assess safety adherence WBV osteoporotic patient Study Design : General Design This multi-center randomize control trial ( RCT ) osteoporosis patient start standard PTH treatment accord Danish Osteoporosis guideline . Participants randomized standard PTH treatment alone standard PTH treatment WBV . Statistical Plan : Sample Size Determination The inclusion 32 participant ( 16 group ) would give study 80 % power detect clinically significant additional increase 22 % WBV ( assume 9 % increase BMD PTH alone group 11 % increase combine PTH+WBV group , assume SD BMD increase 2 % . Allowing 20 % dropout rate , plan include 40 participant ( 20 group ) . From previous research WBV one investigator ( TM ) , statistically significant difference find bone formation marker muscle strength 3 month WBV control group sample size 35 . The number participant latter pilot work reassuringly consistent sample size calculation . The number need include far less ( 34 % ) actual number patient treat PTH recruit department similar time period last year . Statistical Methods : STATA/SPSS use data analysis . For primary endpoint ( BMD 12 month ) mean percentage change BMD two group compare use Analysis Variance ( ANOVA ) provide distribution normal . For endpoint parametric test use assess difference two group normally distribute data non-parametric test data normally distribute . The randomization do online data capture program Red Cap . There create Data dictionary contains detailed description variable used registry , include source variable , normal range relevant . Information : Participants recruit attendance outpatient clinic . At time subject give full explanation study well patient information sheet invite participate study . At interval less 24 hour , patient invite consent prior start PTH treatment . The information sufficient subject make informed decision participation study . The subject complete sign consent form indicate give valid consent participate trial . Withdrawal Subjects : Patients withdraw consent participation trial withdrawn trial . This affect standard medical management cause adverse effect subject .</detailed_description>
