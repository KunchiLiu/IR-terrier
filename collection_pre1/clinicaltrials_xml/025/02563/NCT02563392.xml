	<brief_summary>Hysterectomy effective treatment use first-line approach uterine myoma . Several others alternative hysterectomy develop recent year woman wish retain uterus : myomectomy , radiological embolization , focus ultrasound . Myomectomy , particularly minimally invasive surgery , currently consider conservative treatment choice patient wish preserve fertility . However , three important issue consider : risk intra- postoperative bleeding , risk recur myoma , preservation subsequent fertility . Preventive uterine artery occlusion combine laparoscopic myomectomy order avoid bleed improve uterine suture . Another expect long-term benefit improvement treatment efficacy , lead less symptoms myoma recurrence . However , effect uterine artery occlusion ovarian reserve woman childbearing age yet study , limit clinical application .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Does Preventive Uterine Artery Occlusion During Laparoscopic Myomectomy Impact Ovarian Reserve Markers ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives : 1 . To assess effect preventive uterine artery occlusion laparoscopic myomectomy ovarian reserve parameter ; 2 . To evaluate effect preventive uterine artery occlusion laparoscopic myomectomy intra- postoperative blood loss , operative time , clinical symptom improvement , long-term recurrence myoma fertility . Materials method : Design : This prospective randomize single blind trial , include 60 woman undergo laparoscopic myomectomy symptomatic uterine myoma . Patients randomize two group : control group `` myomectomy alone '' experimental group `` myomectomy preventive uterine artery occlusion '' . Setting : The duration study normally 5 year take place University Hospitals Geneva . The study include 20 woman per year follow-up last 2 year . Inclusion criterion : woman childbearing age , wish retain uterus , symptomatic uterine myoma eligible laparoscopic myomectomy . The parameter intraoperatively evaluate operation time , blood loss complication surgical technique . Postoperative complication , improve clinical symptom , myoma recurrence fertility discuss short long term follow-up . The ovarian reserve evaluate pre- postoperatively patient . It determine plasmatic AMH ( anti-Mullerian Hormone ) ultrasound antral follicle count . Women undetectable preoperative plasmatic AMH exclude study . Plasmatic AMH antral follicle count measure 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 24 month postoperative follow-up . Limitations : The sample size calculate order demonstrate significant difference plasmatic AMH myomectomy . Small difference highlight study , probably would impact clinical practice . Impact study : The result study could real impact daily surgical practice . In case persistent alteration ovarian reserve experimental group compare control group , preventive uterine artery occlusion laparoscopic myomectomy indicate patient wish pregnancy . If significant impact ovarian reserve beneficial effect reduce intraoperative blood loss long-term improvement symptom , systematically propose patient undergo laparoscopic myomectomy .</detailed_description>
