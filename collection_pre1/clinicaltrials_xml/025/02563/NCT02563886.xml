	<brief_title>Electrically Assisted Movement Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot study quantifies functional gain induce Electrically Assisted Movement Therapy ( EAMT ) , extension Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy moderately-to-severely paralyze patient stable plateau phase recovery . During EAMT , patient assist affected upper limb movement functional electrical stimulation . Initially , patient divide two group . One group receive EAMT , receive best possible physical occupational therapy . Therapy consist 40 session 45 minute twice per day five week , include one-week therapy break . After 20 session , group allocation crossed-over , patient n't receive therapy one week .</detailed_description>
