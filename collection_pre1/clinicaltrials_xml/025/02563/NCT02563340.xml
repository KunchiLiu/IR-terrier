	<brief_summary>This study design investigate efficacy safety allogeneic bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell ( BM-MSCs ) chronic antibody-mediated rejection ( cAMR ) kidney transplantation . Chronic AMR diagnose accord Banff criterion 2013 base renal graft biopsy donor specific antibody ( DSA ) examination . cAMR patient assign MSCs group control group . Patients control group prescribe current desensitization therapy include least one follow treatment : plasmapheresis ( PP ) , intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIG ) , rituximab Bortezomib , depend individual pathological immunological feature ( eg . DSA type titer ) study subject . Patients MSCs group receive additional BM-MSCs therapy besides desensitization treatment control group . Allogeneic BM-MSCs ( 1*10^6/kg ) intravenously administer every two week four consecutive dos . All cAMR patient follow one year . Renal function , DSA level , pathological feature , patient/graft survival , severe adverse event monitor follow-up period . Immunological feature patient group consecutively examine .</brief_summary>
