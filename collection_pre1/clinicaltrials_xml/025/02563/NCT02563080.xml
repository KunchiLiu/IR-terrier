	<brief_title>Pancreatic Exocrine Insufficiency Acute Pancreatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective pilot study 50 patient first attack moderately severe severe acute pancreatitis ( AP ) classify new revise criterion AP 2012 treat Helsinki University Hospital . The included patient treat accord exist hospital practice current guideline AP ( American Pancreatic Association guideline ) . The development pancreatic exocrine insufficiency determine measure fecal elastase-1 test . The test measure hospitalization time ( baseline testing ) , follow-up period 1-2 month 12 month discharge hospital . The baseline test measure soon severity AP know patient include study , first stool sample available . Patients previous history AP , chronic pancreatitis , know pancreatic exocrine insufficiency previous pancreatic surgery exclude . The patient ' characteristic ( age , gender , comorbidities ) etiology AP , laboratory value admission , image finding data give treatment interventional therapy length hospital stay collect hospital chart . Also 30-day hospital mortality record . Patients ' symptom ( weight loss , diarrhea , abdominal pain ) BMIs record physical examination 1-2 month follow-up visit . 12 month discharge hospital patient ' symptom BMIs record phone inquiry . 5-year survival first AP attack determine hospital record . The approval ethic committee hospital obtain . An informed consent obtain patient . Development pancreatic exocrine insufficiency first attack moderately severe severe AP confirm fecal elastase-1 test primary endpoint study . Also , persistence pancreatic exocrine insufficiency probable new development follow-up assessed ( secondary endpoint ) . 30-day hospital mortality 5-year survival first attack moderately severe severe AP determine well ( secondary endpoint ) . The aim study ( study period ) change exist management AP . The exist guideline treatment severe AP patient include enzyme supplementation therapy . However , patient low fecal elastase-1 level indicate pancreatic exocrine insufficiency follow-up period 12 month , inform enzyme supplementation therapy . And patient willing start therapy , administrate .</detailed_description>
