	<brief_title>Association Dipping Pattern Early Morning Surge BP With Asymptomatic Episodes Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation Subjects With Hypertension ( DIMOSPAF )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atrial fibrillation , also know AF Afib , abnormal irregular heart rhythm electrical signal generate chaotically throughout upper chamber ( atrium ) heart . According NICE clinical guideline , patient experience recurrent ( two ) AF episodes terminate spontaneously without treatment le seven day , usually within 48 hour classify paroxysmal AF . It show paroxysmal AF comprise approximately 25 % 62 % case AF , estimate incidence prevalence likely rise worldwide population age dramatically next twenty year . Interestingly , hospitalization due AF increase sharply US last decade , pose thereby heavy economic burden health care system society . Likewise , hypertension ( HTN ) also constitute major public health problem globally , prevalence set increase owe widespread population age . This epidemiological trend especially prevalent rapidly develop country early routine screen point health care underutilized among risk subject , due several perceived barrier . Moreover , HTN awareness critical optimal BP control since under-diagnosis , under-treatment and/or un-treatment high BP level deleterious effect cardiovascular system . In addition , HTN single important risk factor cerebrovascular stroke , clearly demonstrate also associate structural functional change myocardium favor development AF , increase risk thromboembolism . Among alteration , leave ventricular hypertrophy ( LVH ) , impaired ventricular filling , leave atrial enlargement slow atrial conduction velocity identify important herald cardiovascular morbidity mortality . More specifically , since HTN AF two condition often co-exist , especially patient advanced age , risk considerable morbidity mortality increase even , point towards significance optimal BP control hold prevention cardiovascular event . To knowledge , Framingham Heart Study , control age predisposing condition , HTN diabetes emerge cardiovascular risk factor predict AF . It also suggest nocturnal HTN non-dipping BP sleep distinct entity often occur together regard important harbinger poor cardiovascular prognosis . Recently , Pierdomenico et al. , show non-dipper sustained hypertensive two-fold great risk develop AF dipper one . This may due fact nighttime HTN may powerful determinant long-standing left ventricular diastolic dysfunction , subsequently increase atrial stretch . Furthermore , observe nighttime hemodynamics , associate higher sympathetic reduced vagal activity , may trigger AF . Additionally , sympathetic activation associate stimulation renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis ( RAAA ) , lead increase leave ventricular diastolic preload , atrial ventricular fibrosis , exert thus direct cellular electrophysiological effect . Besides , scientist suggest nighttime HTN well associate cardiovascular target organ damage ( TOD ) compare non-dipping pattern . According recent guideline ESH , presence microalbuminuria , increase pulse wave velocity , LVH echocardiogram carotid plaque detect carotid ultrasonography , constitute marker asymptomatic organ damage clearly demonstrate multiple study predict CV mortality independently SCORE stratification . In study try investigate whether abnormality circadian rhythm BP ( extreme dip non-dipping pattern , and/or morning surge ) hypertensive subject without TOD associate development new-onset paroxysmal AF . 24-hr ambulatory BP monitoring ( ABPM ) along 24-hour blood pressure monitor AF detector help u examine incidence AF extremely dippers non-dippers , and/or patient exhibit morning surge BP , without TOD . Some question aim answer conduct study whether asymptomatic AF episode commonly detect extreme dipper , non-dippers , morning surgers , daytime nighttime , whether TOD associate asymptomatic AF episode . Importantly , Iqbal et al , demonstrate association AF nighttime DBP . On top , past decade , research study conduct 546 hypertensive subject age &lt; 60 year age followed-up 9.2 year , show DBP , whether 24-hr mean , daytime mean , nighttime mean , provide incremental value prediction morbid event . Thereby , want examine AF episodes association 24hr systolic diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) level . It would also interest observe association AF occurrence mean 24-hr ABPM office heart rate ( HR ) . Moreover , show pulse pressure ( PP ) determine leave atrial enlargement non-dipper patient never-treated essential HTN . Thus , study , also examine whether wide PP associate silent AF episode treat hypertensive subject . Summarizing , goal study determine ) .the association abnormal circadian BP development paroxysmal AF hypertensive patient , b ) .at level TOD , paroxysmal AF episode detect hypertensive subject , c ) .if association systolic and/or diastolic BP level AF occurrence , ) .whether mean heart rate 24-hr interval associate development paroxysmal AF , finally e ) .examine relationship wide PP asymptomatic AF episodes patient HTN . Study Population We evaluate adult patient refer family physician `` Hypertension Cardiovascular Prevention '' Outpatient Clinic Evangelismos General Hospital Athens , June 2015 present . All patient average office systolic BP ≥140 mmHg and/or average diastolic BP ≥90 mmHg three consecutive visit consider essential HTN . Furthermore , individual treatment one antihypertensive drug also enrol study . Objectives Primary endpoint • To investigate whether nighttime BP pattern ( extreme dipping , normal dipping reduce dip non-dipping include riser ) early morning surge associate detection paroxysmal AF hypertensive subject . Further definition Normal diurnal systolic diastolic BP pattern : arterial BP daily variation characterize substantial reduction sleep , rapid rise upon awaken , increased variability awake period ambulant normal subject hypertensive patient . Reduced diurnal systolic diastolic BP pattern : nocturnal systolic and/or DBP fall 1 10 % daytime value night/day systolic and/or diastolic BP ratio &lt; 1 &gt; 0.9 . Nocturnal HTN : increase absolute level night time systolic and/or diastolic BP ( ≥120/70 mmHg ) .19 Dipping pattern define daytime-nighttime BP/daytime BP reduction - base either ABP home BP ( HBP ) monitoring- great 10 % systolic and/or diastolic BP . Nighttime HTN define nighttime ABP HBP ≥125/75 mmHg ( systolic and/or diastolic ) . Non-dipping rising : reduction increase nocturnal systolic and/or diastolic BP night/day systolic and/or diastolic BP ratio ≥1 . Extreme dipping : marked nocturnal systolic and/or diastolic BP fall &gt; 20 % daytime systolic and/or diastolic value night/day systolic and/or diastolic BP ratio &lt; 0.8 . Morning surge : excessive systolic and/or diastolic BP elevation rise morning . Secondary endpoint - To detect asymptomatic intermittent AF use 24h ABPM atrial fibrillation detector device compare accuracy Holter monitoring . - To investigate agreement detection paroxysmal AF use simultaneously 24h-ABP AF detection device loop record . - To observe level TOD , asymptomatic AF episodes commonly detect . - To study relationship systolic and/or diastolic BP level AF occurrence . - To examine whether office HR mean HR use ABPM associate development silent AF episodes . - To examine whether wide PP ABPM associate development silent AF episodes . Variables use determine primary secondary endpoint - Sociodemographic data ( birth date , gender , education level , employment status , place residence , smoke status/habits , alcohol consumption ) - Anthropometric characteristic ( body weight , height , waist circumference ) - Any abnormal finding physical examination - Clinical relevant medical history comorbidities - Concomitant medication - Electrocardiographic assessment - Investigation TOD , include echocardiography , carotid artery triplex , 24h-urine albumin excretion ABI - Recent laboratory test result include hemoglobin , hematocrit , blood glucose , kidney liver function test - Management HTN ( pharmacologic non-pharmacologic treatment ) Inclusion Criteria - Patients diagnosed essential HTN ( office BP &gt; 140/90mmHg ) patient receive least one antihypertensive medication ( ie .
