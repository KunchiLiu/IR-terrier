	<brief_title>Intestinal Microbiota Patients Before After Bariatric Surgery Healthy Controls</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The human gastrointestinal tract home extremely numerous diverse collection microbe community , collectively term `` intestinal microbiota '' . This amazingly complex poorly understood group community enormous impact human . Indeed , microbiota consider play number key role maintenance host health , include aid digestion otherwise indigestible dietary compound , synthesis vitamin beneficial metabolite , immune system regulation enhance resistance colonization pathogenic microorganism . Conversely , intestinal microbiota also potent source antigen potentially harmful compound . Schematically , human consider exist state natural balance microbial inhabitant . A shift balance microbiota composition may become deleterious host health term `` dysbiosis '' . Dysbiosis gut microbiota implicate numerous disorder , range intestinal inflammatory bowel diseases colorectal cancer disorder systemic effect diabetes , obesity , insulin resistance steatohepatitis . The link microbes human gut development obesity , cardiovascular disease metabolic syndrome , type 2 diabetes , become clearer , complexity microbial community , functional connection less well understood . In humans animal , bariatric surgery ( mainly gastric bypass surgery ) lead alteration gut microbiota , seem favourable . In study investigator aim examine effect different bariatric procedure composition gut microbiota .</detailed_description>
