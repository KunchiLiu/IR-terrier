	<brief_summary>During space mission crew perform wide variety task different acceleration condition . For handle display control item mission , astronaut 's performance strong depend intuitive usability . Currently investigator explore develop different Augmented Reality interfaces International Standard Payload Rack ( ISPR ) Biolab instal International Space Station ( ISS ) module Columbus . Augmented reality ( AR ) live , direct indirect , view physical , real-world environment whose element augment computer-generated sensory input sound , video , graphic GPS data . Using AR technology provide user-oriented support work procedure development , production , operate complex technical product system . It conceivable future man mission interface apply space operation , astronaut handle virtual information enriches physical reality . To improve support operational ground team space crew perform service maintenance task Columbus space laboratory Biolab , investigator explore innovative tridimensional ( 3D ) interaction technique allow intuitive way interact virtual content . The developed AR interface ISPR Biolab ought offer support handle standardize service maintenance procedure . This research primarily focus support ground team work engineering model Biolab locate Cologne Institute Aerospace Medicine . Applying interfaces subsequently space operation require previous exploration regard influence different acceleration condition ought consider investigator ' current stage designing development . Thereby one important aspect focus correct placement virtual user interface interact . To explore human adaption handle control virtual AR interface , experiment denotes usability study supply finding human mental workload sensorimotor coordination perform experimentation task different acceleration gravity . The propose experiment supply essential information understand adequate quality characteristic concern placement virtual interface physical reality identify disturb factor apply hyper-g micro-g condition .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Investigations description -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Augmented Reality 2 different Head-Mounted-Displays ( ARVision3D Trivisio ; dataGlass/2A Shimadzu ) , control 2 PC use . The first HMD monocular optical see-through ( OST ) HMD : equip semi-transparent LCD display one eye . The user directly see physical world without limitation regard peripheral field view . The second HMD binocular video see-through ( VST ) HMD : equip two LCD display stereo camera system record physical environment replay video onto display real-time . Experimental protocol -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Before flight subject familiarize setup protocol . For flight day , 2 subject study one AR device . Halfway flight , 2 subject swap place . The procedure follow 3 day . The experiment day start 7.30 a.m. test subject equip heart rate record device . After take-off work permit , 2 subject go experimental area seat . They equip one HMD ( optical- video-see HM ) . During parabola subject perform experimentation task : symbolic input five letter onto virtual keyboard depend experimental task parabola . To point towards virtual keyboard subject wear thimble forefinger . The body-alignment scenario require additional panel subject 's non-dominant hand . During parabola two subject perform task - one use HMD type 1 hyper-g subject use HMD type 2 micro-g. During 8 minute rest period parabolas 15 16 , 2 test subject switch place . Switching place straightforward process member team expertise man test equipment .</detailed_description>
