	<brief_title>Imputation PaO2 From SaO2</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment ( SOFA ) score validated measure severity illness time intensive care unit ( ICU ) patient use follow course organ dysfunction response treatment1 . SOFA become frequently use scoring system patient multi-organ failure , give high sensitivity specificity predictor morbidity mortality critically ill patients2 . The severity respiratory dysfunction measure SOFA score PaO2/FiO2 ( PF ) ratio , also use measure severity hypoxemia patient acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) . An invasive sampling arterial blood gas ( ABG ) require measure PaO2 PF . Often , patient less severe hypoxemia may clinically undergo ABG test routine basis ; hence clinical research utility SOFA scoring system reduce . Furthermore , previous study reveal concern anemia follow repeat blood sampling ; hence , tendency implement less invasive approach lead less frequent ABG measurement critically ill patients3 . However , almost ICU patient monitor pulse oximeter , measure percent saturation hemoglobin oxygen ( SpO2 ) . Whether SpO2 use impute PaO2 determine PF ratio robustly evaluate prospective study critically ill patient . Prior work investigate association PaO2 SpO2 include post hoc study ARDS Network patients4 . This study exclude patient altitude , use linear model highly non-linear relationship , could determine whether SpO2 PaO2 simultaneously measure . A similar approach apply ARDS Network patient derive SpO2-based respiratory subscore SOFA score5 . Several similar , retrospective study perform mechanically ventilated child , consistently use linear model correlation SF PF ratio , similar limitations6-9 . The Ellis inversion10 Severinghaus equation11 provide useful non-linear method impute PaO2 SaO2 . This technique use multiple cohort patient pneumonia12-14 . This simple calculation improve incorporating PaCO2 pH value , could available venous blood gas may obtain patient without arterial catheter . Because Severinghaus/Ellis estimate SaO2 , method estimate SaO2 SpO2 necessary . There current validate reliable method calculate SaO2 basis measure SpO2 . Skin pigmentation affect accuracy SpO2 , sex oximeter type15,16 . The aim study ( 1 ) find relationship PaO2 SaO2 among mechanically ventilate patient ( 2 ) create reliable system utilize SF ratio impute PF ratio assess respiratory parameter SOFA score .</detailed_description>
