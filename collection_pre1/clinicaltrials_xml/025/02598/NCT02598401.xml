	<detailed_description>Children , teenager young adult age 10 ( include day 10th birthday ) 24 year 364 day ( time diagnosis ) first diagnosis acute lymphoblastic leukaemia lymphoblastic lymphoma ( T-NHL SmIg negative precursor B-NHL ) diagnose standard criterion eligible BONES . The recruitment target 50 2 year period , base anticipated ascertainment target 75 % . Information collect basic demographic , present feature diagnosis initial recruitment . Further data collect end induction ascertain treatment response , along result relevant investigation perform induction detail . Clinical information collect include height , weight puberty stage . At four subsequent time point MRI imagine perform data also collect , include physiotherapy assessment use structure assessment tool marker bone turnover . Investigations The result follow investigation , usually perform part routine assessment , collect : 1 . At diagnosis - high white cell count , immunophenotype , cytogenetics , molecular result ; albumin ; lipid profile ; vitamin D level 2 . At end induction - MRD result , flow cytometry end induction bone marrow ; albumin ; lipid profile DEXA scan perform child &gt; 10y old treatment ALL . It recommend DEXA scan perform diagnosis annually . The result DEXA scan collect . MRI hip , knee ankle comprise unenhanced coronal T1 STIR image minimum protocol . Knees ankle image together .
