	<brief_summary>Glycemic index ( GI ) food know positively associate development several disease include type 2 diabetes , cardiovascular disease age-related macular degeneration . Modest dietary change high-GI food low-GI food show beneficial effect . These finding translate recommendation increase dietary intake whole grain . However , inverse relationship whole grain consumption risk different component metabolic syndrome explain fiber content . Trials add cereal fiber fail induce protective effect fiber thus propose marker component whole grain impart health advantage . Whole wheat grain know rich source several mineral ( phosphorus , potassium magnesium ) play role glucose metabolism , deplete process refinement . Thus , plausible hypothesize benefit whole grain previously ascribe fiber content fact due mineral . The propose research aim restore fortify white bread mineral determine result glycemic index mineral-fortified bread . With much evidence people prefer taste color white bread , low GI , mineral fortify white bread potential reduce risk Metabolic Syndrome consume .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The production white flour require mill wheat grain extraction proportion grain . The level 80 % extraction most-commonly used production white flour market process lead substantial loss vitamin mineral ( Table 1 ) . These vitamin mineral know affect energy metabolism . For example , thiamin know affect carbohydrate metabolism low thiamin intake know cause Beriberi . This lead establishment acceptable carbohydrate energy : thiamin ratio ( 0.4mg thiamin/1000 kcal ) many country fortify white wheat flour thiamin sustain acceptable ratio . Although several mineral know affect energy carbohydrate metabolism clear ratio put place yet . Table 1 : effect mill mineral content wheat flour Mineral content Wheat flour ( white ) Wheat flour ( whole grain ) Loss ( % ) Phosphorus ( mg/100g ) 108 346 69 Potassium ( mg/100g ) 107 408 74 Magnesium ( mg/100g ) 22 138 84 Specific Aim 1 : Determine acceptability mineral fortify white bread . White flour supplement mineral produce mineral-fortified bread . The acceptability bread test . White wheat flour ( 80 % extraction ) fortify mineral . Potassium phosphate use source phosphorus potassium fortify white flour . From previous experience , addition potassium phosphate glucose solution find minimally affect organoleptic property . Unlike sodium phosphate well tolerated subject due development unfavorable flavor ( fishy flavor ) . At time , magnesium chloride use source magnesium . Magnesium chloride know highly soluble commonly use supplement fortificant . Locally produce white wheat flour ( 80 % extraction ) whole grain wheat flour purchase store department . White whole flour sample ( n=3 ) analyze content phosphorus , magnesium potassium accord standard procedure Fortification : White Bread Restoration ( WB-R ) : A quantity white flour fortified mineral level restore content mineral whole grain wheat flour . Based data table , white flour restoration require addition : 250 mg P/100g white flour ( total P =358mg/100g ) 100 mg Mg/100g white flour ( total Mg =122mg/100g ) White Bread Fortification ( WB-F ) : A quantity white flour fortified mineral level 100 % high whole grain wheat flour . Based data table , white flour fortification require addition : 580mg P/100g white flour ( total P= 688mg/100g ) 250mg Mg/100g white flour ( total Mg= 272 mg/100g ) Making bread : Four different type bread make : White bread ( WB ) White bread mineral restoration ( WB-R ) White bread mineral fortification ( WB-F ) Whole grain bread ( WGB ) Acceptability bread : Bread sample ( white bread whole wheat bread control 2 experimental sample ) test acceptability . Panelists ( n= 60 ) recruit base willingness participate study consumption Arabic bread . Panelists ask fill questionnaire rate serve sample 9-point hedonic scale 1 represent dislike extremely 9 represent like extremely overall acceptability , acceptability appearance , texture taste . The order presentation sample counterbalance . Mineral carbohydrate content bread : Phosphorus , potassium magnesium starch content bread determine . Specific Aim 2 : Assess sensory difference different bread treatment . The bread make step . Panelists regular consumer white bread recruit assess sensory difference white bread control white bread mineral supplement experimental sample . The triangle test use difference test . All subject ask sign human subject consent form answer demographic information . Demographic information request : 1 ) age , 2 ) gender , 3 ) frequency bread consumption , 4 ) type bread typically consume , 5 ) factor influence panelist ' bread purchase . Twenty four panelist participate three triangle test , compare white bread control vs. three experimental sample test . In session , subject debrief ) product consume , b ) procedures test , c ) instruction sample beverage , ) use score card . All sample present random , balance order . Specific Aim 3 : Determine glycemic index mineral supplement bread . Glycemic index four different type bread determine . In experiment , healthy subject ( n=12 ) ask maintain regular dietary physical activity habit entire study course , avoid alcohol consumption well unusual strenuous exercise 24 hour prior study . Exclusion criterion include : significant medical disease ; pregnancy lactation ; regular use medication affect body weight ; weight loss 3 % precede 3 month . Following 12 hour ( overnight ) fast , take test facility [ Faculty Agriculture Food Sciences/Department Nutrition Central research unit ( CRU ) / American University Hospital ] : anthropometric measurement ( height , weight ) take . A catheter insert blood withdrawal . Glycemic index food determine . In brief , overnight fasted subject give bread ( 50 g carbohydrate ) ingest within 10-15 min drink 250ml water . Blood sample take immediately meal 15 , 30 , 45 , 60 , 90 120 minute meal ingestion . Blood withdrawn train practitioner use determination glucose . Glucose area curve ( AUC ) calculate . The GI value food calculate mean value : 100 x ( AUC test food ) / ( AUC reference food ) subject . In addition , mineral content blood determine several metabolite ( glucose , Tg , FFA , P ) , K , Mg hormone ( insulin ) measure .</detailed_description>
