	<detailed_description>State question research objective : International trial show ultrasound measurement cervix identifies population high risk preterm delivery . In case short neck several type treatment recommend : progesterone , establishment strap pessary . These three treatment reduce risk preterm delivery . There French study . The objective study reduce prematurity PACA region Monaco-Corsica introducing routine ultrasound screen strategy asymptomatic short neck . Expected result : prematurity 50 % Population concern : All patient active singleton pregnancy 16 26 SA SA eligible ultrasound cervix . Method observation deduction investigation : Study / compare two period : period A ( 2013 ) Period B ( 2015 ) . - Primary endpoint : delivery rate 37 week . - Criteria secondary judgment rate delivery 37 week , neonatal mortality morbidity . Data flow mode : Duration term organization research : The actual duration study ( preparation implementation , monitor inclusion ) set 36 month . This study conduct context network . All maternity hospital belong network invite participate . Referents investigate doctor appoint . The attaché clinical research collaboration Network Coordinator , Michele Marcot , get back data year 2013 transfer record examination , delivery specification , review hospitalization mother child . Data collection 2015 base collection form complement investigator involve project inclusion patient . These sheet collect real time RCAF charge monitoring study proceed seizure . Positive case ( short neck - less 25mm ) offer progesterone treatment , band establishment pessary accord habit practitioner service protocol . If treatment progesterone retain , Vaginal Progesterone 200mg , natural micronized progesterone without excipients know effect capsule form . Data Analysis Method : Statistical analysis initiate verification validity database ( query broadcast clinician involve study , consistency check ) . There procedure data anonymization algorithm give individual number . A lookup table available , separate operating base . Only number enter computer database . The database frozen . After base gel , consolidated data process statistician . Data analysis perform use SPSS Version 17.0 software Windows statistician Unit Clinical Research Methodology ( Loundou Anderson , head Prof. Pascal Auquier ) . Statistical significance test set 5 % . The type unilateral bilateral test depend choose alternative , especially base result already available previous study . The qualitative variable express term number percentage , quantitative variable report use usual parameter position ( mean , median ) dispersion ( standard deviation , range ) . The normality distribution quantitative data systematically search use Shapiro-Wilks test . If variable normally distribute , conventional processing technique ( logarithmic , ... ) implement . Initially , comparability study population inclusion make variable collected time : socio-demographic clinical ( use Mantel-Haenszel test , Chi-2 accurate Fisher qualitative variable , Student 's test ANOVA quantitative variable ) reveal potential confounding factor consider analyze criterion judgment . Comparisons study population also conduct criterion secondary judgment . Adjustments make variable identify confound factor conduct multivariate analysis ( analysis variance , multivariate logistic regression ) . Justification number subject power analysis : The prematurity rate 7.4 % 2013 France ( PACA , Périnat data 2010 ) . We expect reduction rate 1.5 point ( 6 % ) period 2015 refer reduction prematurity obtain Kiss , et al , 2003 . To achieve reduction preterm birth rate , include 3500 patient period . Considering selection criterion active file various partner , inclusion patient period 3500 2014 quite achievable . ( 44,000 birth per year network level , among ensure 10 % meet predefined criterion ) . Regarding second period , reason ; among list eligible patient , random draw conduct determine 3500 patient represent period . Thus 3500 patient include period 2014 , 10 % short neck 350 patient offer Progesterone , band establishment pessary .</detailed_description>
