	<detailed_description>This randomize , observer-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel-group , multicenter , 2-part , Phase 2 study Ad26.ZEBOV MVA-BN-Filo healthy HIV infect adult . In part 1 , prime vaccination MVA-Bn-Filo follow boost vaccination Ad26 14 day later US . In part 2 , two regimen investigate . The first regimen Ad26 prime vaccination follow MVA-BN-Filo boost 28 day later second regimen MVA-BN-Filo prime vaccination follow MVA-BN-Filo boost 14 day later Africa . The study consist Screening phase 8 week ( start moment participant sign ICF ) , Vaccination Phase , participant vaccinate baseline ( Day 1 ) follow boost vaccination Day 15 29 , post-boost follow-up phase maximum 1 year post-boost vaccination . Upon completion 6-month post boost visit participant receive active vaccine enter long-term follow-up 1 year post boost vaccination visit ass long-term safety immunogenicity .</detailed_description>
