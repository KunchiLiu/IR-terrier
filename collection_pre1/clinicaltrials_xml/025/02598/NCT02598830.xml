	<brief_summary>This study evaluate effect vitamin D supplementation outcomes 12 week progressive strength train 130 ageing subject ( &gt; 45 year age ) . Participants recruit two similarly size stratum ; one containing COPD patient one contain healthy subject . In stratum , half participant receive vitamin D supplementation half subject receive placebo</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Physical activity potent way relieve adverse morbidity associate COPD , cachexia . It thus problematic 20-30 % patient fail elicit positive adaptation train . This oddity ascribe inherent muscular property , potential link comorbidities vitamin D testosterone deficiency nature training program . In present project , take double-blinded RCT disclose functional biological efficacy vitamin D supplementation ( concomitant ingestion 1000 mg Ca2+ ) outcome 12 wks strength train 130 age individual without COPD . 65 COPD patient 65 healthy subject allocate two stratum separately randomize two equally sized supplementation group ; ) vitamin D3 ii ) placebo . All subject perform lower-limb strength-training protocol contralateral manner : leg 1 ) high-resistance ( 5-12 RM ) leg 2 ) low-resistance ( 20-30 RM ) . Such one-limb-at-a-time protocol ensure train unconfined cardiorespiratory limitation inherent patient , allow comparison two training modality manner unconfined individual variation exercise adaptability . A pilot study compare one-footed two-feeted training protocol perform . In addition , subject perform selection bilateral upper body exercise ( 5-12 RM ) , ensure adequate hormonal response compliance study . The study likely revitalize guideline rehabilitation COPD patient , provide vital information regard role vitamin D adaptation strength training . For outcome measure specific COPD patient , lung function disease-related quality life , final analysis perform data COPD population . For outcome measure , muscle mass strength , final analysis perform data merge COPD patient healthy subject . An important rationale behind implement healthy control subject project protocol increase statistical power outcome measure unrelated COPD epidemiology hence universal relevance physiologcial adaptation strength training . In related set analysis , perform between-groups comparison , include multivariate analysis . We also compare efficacy high- low-resistance strength training , perform participant , expect result similar muscular adaptation , include similar increase muscle mass strength . In general , anticipate baseline vitamin D level blood ( hence change vitamin D , obtain supplementation ) , measure 25 ( OH ) D , major determinant efficacy intervention . This mean individual low baseline level 25 ( OH ) D expect display pronounce change functional biological outcome measure high baseline value . Such scenario could relate inability project protocol increase blood level 25 ( OH ) D beyond certain level ; i.e . individual certain blood level 25 ( OH ) D respond vitamin D3 supplementation increase 25 ( OH ) D level ( essentially mean ingestion vitamin D3 level exceeded elimination vitamin D derivative ) . Alternatively , may relate inability tissue respond result elevation physiological vitamin D level . To assess individual variation vitamin D response , data functional biological variable muscle mass strength , divide quartile base baseline 25 ( OH ) D-levels , whereupon comparison make low-end high-end quartile . Individual variation also assess use mixed model approach .</detailed_description>
