	<brief_summary>Stage 1 - Evaluation Status Early Reached Target Enteral Nutrition critically ill child PICU ( ERTEN PICU ) . In critically ill child , data factor influence enteral nutrition feed intolerance.The investigator aim reach goal study - To initiate enteral feed pediatric intensive care unit - To demonstrate reason whether early enteral feeding initiate - To determine incidence feed intolerance - To identify situation analgesia , sedation , catecholamine individual preference medical staff lead delay interruption enteral feed pediatric intensive care unit - To investigate relation successful enteral feeding mortality , morbidity du sepsis , septic shock multiorgan failure Stage 2 - IFABP biomarker feed intolerance critically ill child PICU ( IFABP PICU ) Critically ill child increase risk intestinal injury , gastrointestinal dysfunction feed intolerance , associate delayed recovery increase morbidity mortality course pediatric intensive care unit . In critically ill child , little data factor influence enteral nutrition . We hypothesise IFABP might use biomarker show early intestinal damage due medication . Aim There information show role intestinal microcirculation problem mucosal integrity feed intolerance pediatric intensive care unit.We aim reach goal study - To show value IFABP regard identify feed intolerance early detection enteral feeding intolerance - To show relation IFABP concentration enteral feeding intolerance - To show relation mechanical ventilation setting , sedation , inotropic medication dose IFABP concentration feed intolerance - To show relation IFABP concentration mortality morbidity due sepsis , septic shock multi system organ failure Stage 1 ( ERTEN PICU ) complete . In many patient , initiation feed seem delay without evidence-based reason . ERTEN achieve 43 ( 25.3 % ) 95 patient within 48 h PICU admission . Patients Early Initiation Feeding statistically significant likely ERTEN . ERTEN independent significant prognostic factor survival ( p &lt; 0.001 ) , reach target enteral caloric intake day 2 indicating improve survival .</brief_summary>

In critically ill child , little data factor influence enteral nutrition . Feeding intolerance critically ill child may due part alteration gastrointestinal motility secondary underlying disease process administration medication.It also know role hyperglycemia , caloric density enteral nutrition gastrointestinal feedback mechanism , routine intensive care management sedation , analgesia catecholamine feed intolerance critically ill child .
