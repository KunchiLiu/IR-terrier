	<detailed_description>The study randomize interventional non inferiority study enroll 30 adult age 18 old diagnosis cystoid macular edema secondary non-infectious uveitis . Potential subject recruit retina uveitis clinic Casey Eye Institute , Oregon health science University ( OHSU ) . Potential recruit ask sign date inform consent copy give subject prior study procedure . Subjects screen visit injection procedure study doctor decide meet criterion study . This study require 6 visit clinic take 6 month complete . During screen visit , medical/ surgical/ ocular history collect subject medical record . Laboratory test perform rule infectious uveitis subject already infectious type uveitis rule since time diagnosis uveitis . Urine collection pregnancy test female childbearing potential do . Examination subject include measurement visual acuity , examination front back part eye , measurement eye pressure . A scan retina obtain spectral domain optical coherence tomography ( SD-OCT ) . During injection visit , history , examination , pregnancy test repeat addition receive injection . Subjects randomize either inject study drug intravitreal subtenon route . Examination injection perform rule immediate complication . Then subject 4 follow-up visit ( 2 week , 1 month , 3 month 6 month ) . During visit , subject ask adverse event , concomitant medication , eye feel addition obtain clinical examination OCT .</detailed_description>
