	<brief_summary>In colorectal surgery , anastomotic leak septic consequence still remain concern complication result substantial morbidity mortality . A common determine factor assess viability bowel anastomosis adequate arterial perfusion ensure sufficient local tissue oxygenation . Intraoperative near-infrared fluorescence ( INIF ) image use indocyanine green ( ICG ) dye novel technique allow surgeon choose point transection optimally perfused area create bowel anastomosis . Recently , INIF image system instal robotic system help identify intravascular NIF signal real time . Although report several case series retrospective cohort describe feasibility safety image system robotic colorectal surgery , date , study address systematically outcomes technique robotic surgery . Considering limitation report , investigator aim conduct prospective randomize trial compare robotic procedure without INIF image patient undergoing colorectal surgery .</brief_summary>
