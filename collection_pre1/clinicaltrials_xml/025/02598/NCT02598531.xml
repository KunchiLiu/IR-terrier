	<brief_summary>The purpose SWIFT Trial answer two research question . 1 . Does bariatric surgery total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) improve perioperative long-term outcome TKA extreme obesity ? 2 . Does bariatric surgery TKA delay possibly negate need arthroplasty ?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Surgical Weight-Loss Improve Functional Status Trajectories Following Total Knee Arthroplasty ( SWIFT Trial )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obese patient purse TKA procedure typically encourage lose weight prior procedure part patient 's treatment plan . If patient chooses receive treatment obesity , Orthopedic provider may refer patient weight management provider . If patient eligible TKA meet inclusion exclusion criterion ( contain BMI correspond comorbidity measure ) , he/she eligible participate study . In study two arm , Test Arm patient undergo bariatric surgery prior TKA Control Arm patient undergo TKA . Patients choose arm enter , base whether want undergo surgical weight loss intervention prior TKA . Test Arm : Participants either undergo Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy Laparoscopic Gastric Bypass surgery . Approximately 9-13 month post bariatric surgery , test arm participant evaluate determine he/she still candidate need knee replacement long exists ( delay ) . If participant still candidate , he/she undergo TKA . Participants complete nine ( 9 ) research visit course 3.5 - 4 year , addition standard care visit require bariatric surgery TKA . Research visit include study activity vital sign measurement , orthopedic outcome assessment , physical function assessment ( i.e . stair climb , 400 meter walk , etc . ) , questionnaire completion , synovial fluid collection patient TKA procedure perform . Control Arm : Participants control arm undergo total knee replacement without surgical weight loss intervention complete six ( 6 ) research visit course 2.5-3 year , addition standard care visit require TKA . Research visit include study activity vital sign measurement , orthopedic outcome assessment , physical function assessment ( i.e . stair climb , 400 meter walk , etc . ) , questionnaire completion , synovial fluid collection time TKA . The study hypothesis weight loss induce bariatric surgery prior TKA improve TKA outcomes patient extreme obesity . The study hypothesis meet one follow outcome achieve : - In &gt; =20 % bariatric surgery patient , need TKA negate delay least two year . - A statistically significant superiority find among patient undergo bariatric surgery + TKA versus undergo TKA least two follow domain two year post TKA : - Mobility ( 400 meter walk test ) - Osteoarthritis outcome ( WOMAC total score ) - Knee orthopedic outcome ( Knee Society score ) - Quality life ( PROMIS-29 Quality Life Questionnaire ) - Osteoarthritic Pain ( KOOS Pain ) - Patient Satisfaction ( If live rest life symptom , would feel ? )</detailed_description>
