	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess rate 50 % prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) decline docetaxel carboplatin . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess PSA response duration docetaxel carboplatin . ( Phase 2 ) II . To assess response measurable disease . ( Phase 2 ) III . To assess time progression bone lesion measurable disease ( Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors [ RECIST ] ) . ( Phase 2 ) IV . To assess response docetaxel carboplatin tumor mutation deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) repair pathway gene ( breast cancer [ BRCA ] 1 , BRCA2 , ataxia telangiectasia mutate [ ATM ] ) . ( Phase 2 ) V. To correlate presence DNA repair pathway mutation copy number alteration metastatic tissue versus circulate tumor cell ( CTC ) cell free DNA . ( Phase 2 ) VI . To correlate change CTC number PSA radiographic response . ( Phase 2 ) OUTLINE : Patients receive docetaxel intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute carboplatin IV 30 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 10 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
