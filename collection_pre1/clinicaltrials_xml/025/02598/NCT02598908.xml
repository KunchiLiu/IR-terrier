	<brief_summary>Participation EQA scheme , available , mandatory United Kingdom Accreditation Service ( UKAS ) . No EQA scheme currently exist TPMT thiopurine metabolite , potential shortcoming test . A pilot project award fund Clinical Pathology Accreditation ( CPA ) . The purpose work collect sample EQA scheme whole blood TPMT ( activity genotype ) thiopurine metabolite , run collaboration UK NEQAS ( United Kingdom National External Quality Assessment Service ) , facilitate comprehensive world-wide service enables laboratories provide test fulfil quality goal ultimately provide optimal patient care .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An EQA Scheme TPMT Activity Thiopurine Metabolites</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The thiopurine S-methyl transferase ( TPMT ) enzyme involve breakdown thiopurine drug ( azathioprine ) , commonly use treat inflammatory bowel disease autoimmune disease . Different individual population different , genetically determine , level TPMT . An individual absent TPMT activity high risk serious side effect thiopurine drug treatment . In routine practice , TPMT activity blood measure start patient thiopurine drug determine effective safe start dose . Thiopurine metabolites breakdown product thiopurine drug monitor blood patient thiopurine drug optimise drug dose . These test perform laboratory across Britain around world . It important patient care result high quality consistent across different centre . One way assess EQA scheme . No EQA scheme currently exist TPMT/thiopurine metabolite , potential shortcoming test . Venous blood collect NHS staff volunteer SWBH outpatient , TPMT measure part routine care , distribute participate laboratory every two month . Where possible find suitable blood donor , pool surplus blood sample laboratory use instead . The laboratory test sample return result UK NEQAS comparison . A report compile allow compare centre make change necessary .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Pathology staff member able donate 60 mL venous blood . SWBH NHS Trust outpatient TPMT activity measure within last 5 year . Consultant happy contact . Able consent donate 60 mL blood . No known Hep B C , HIV , syphilis cytomegalovirus infection . Donors distribution obligation participate longer willing . Only volunteer able give inform consent recruit ( i.e . child adult lack capacity consent ) .</criteria>
