	<brief_title>Preoperative Cognitive Screening Older Surgical Patients Utility Predicting Morbidity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The override hypothesis preoperative cognitive impairment risk factor poor surgical outcome senior preoperative screen superior standard systematic clinical process identify at-risk patient . The first objective ass marginal benefit structure preoperative cognitive screen relative standard systematic preoperative evaluation identifying senior likely cognitive impairment . The second objective determine whether preoperative cognitive impairment predicts postoperative outcome . This project design prospective , single-center observational study . The cohort consist 250 consent subject ≥ 65 year age present BWH Weiner Center Preoperative Evaluation ( CPE ) prior elective low extremity joint replacement surgery . These surgery select common age group , associate significant morbidity , along dementia consider priority area ( bone joint condition ) AHRQ . These age choose significant clinical data demonstrate increase cognitive impairment community dwell elder . Eligibility criterion include : patient ≥ 65 year age ASA physical status I-IV present elective joint replacement . Exclusion criterion include plan ICU admission postoperatively , uncorrected vision hearing impairment ( unable see picture read hear instruction ) ; limit use dominant hand ( limited ability draw ) ; inability speak , read , understand English . Study staff use CPE computerize schedule system , update continuously real time capture relevant information age procedure , identify potential subject . When patient check receptionist CPE appointment notify ( surrogate ) may eligible participate study CPE involve patient age 65 . The receptionist provide brochure study include information purpose study , risk patient , potential benefit society . The patient ask willing speak one study investigator patient agree speak study investigator approach . Patients know cognitive impairment include study determine whether information include preoperative evaluation form . They sign consent capable go sign surgical procedure consent . In event patient capable sign consent surrogate ask provide consent assent patient . In prior study similar patient population less 1 % documented cognitive impairment . The staff member describe goal risk study quiet room PATC ask patient ( surrogate appropriate ) choose participate . After question answer patient opportunity read consent form , write consent obtain one study investigator . After obtain consent , study staff gain information patient 's age year education . Study staff administer standard instrument assess health functional status ( basic instrumental activity daily live [ ADLs IADLs , respectively , WHODAS ] ) . The World Health Organization Disability Scale 2.0 ( WHODAS ) alternative SF36 measure physical health disability . In addition , patient ask 've fall within last 6 month , whether 've evaluate change memory thinking , accompany appointment , employment status , live situation ( alone , institutionalized , live family member ) patient survey . The study staff also administer MiniCog , simple cognitive screen tool take 2-4 min complete little education , language , race bias . In addition , Animal Fluency Test administer , short cognitive screen take one minute complete . Other measure cognitive impairment obtain study staff : documentation patient 's standard preoperative form , patient informant report diagnosis evaluation cognitive impairment memory concern , systematic medical record review . During routine preoperative blood draw phlebotomist provide three heparinized blood tube label patient 's study ID number return investigative team process within 30 minute blood draw . Briefly , half sample would spin plasma harvest store -80 degree C adequate sample size obtain used measure inflammatory cytokine ELISA . The remainder sample divide 1-ml aliquot incubate 37°C 15 min phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) ( control ) , 100 ng/ml interleukin ( IL ) -6 , 100 ng/ml IL-10 , combination 100 ng/mlIL-2 2 ng/ml granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor , 1g/ml lipopolysaccharide . Blood sample resuspend 1.4 ml stabilize buffer incubate 10 min room temperature fixation PFA , cool 4C , store 80C processing flow cytometry determine immune response white blood cell ex-vivo immune challenge whether correlate Mini-Cog score development delirium . Each enrol patient receive business card listing investigator ' contact information advise expect follow telephone call 6 month 1 year surgery verify data element reassess functional outcome . Delirium assess prospectively per day postoperative day 1 , 2 , 3 train study team member use Confusion Assessment Method [ CAM ] . Delirium common postoperative day 1-3 CAM well-validated measure delirium surgical patient . For functional status , WHODAS administer 6-12 month postoperatively either personnel surgeon 's office part routine follow study staff telephone . Investigators also collect information secondary outcomes include duration PATC visit , presence advance directive , whether surgical procedure , time PACU discharge , discharge place home ( rehabilitation , skilled nursing facility ) , hospital length stay ( LOS ) , hospital complication , perioperative variable include drug administer , BIS , estimate blood loss , blood transfusion , fluid administer , blood pressure , oxygen saturation , 30-day reoperation readmission rate , 30-day 1-year mortality . These outcome record medical record , BWH Balanced Scorecard , electronic database hospitalize patient tabulate 31 element hospital event , BWH Research Patient Database Enhanced Query . Data also confirm follow telephone interview . Thirty day 1 year mortality record .</detailed_description>
