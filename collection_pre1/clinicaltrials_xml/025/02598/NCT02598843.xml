	<brief_title>Standard Non Operative Treatment Versus Accelerated Rehabilitation Achilles Tendon Ruptures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This injury traditionally treat plaster cast apply leg period 10 week allow tendon heal , operation repair tendon . Research undertaken investigator department show patient treat surgery plaster similar chance re-rupture tendon treatment gain similar recovery . The investigator therefore manage injury plaster . More recently , research show new type non-surgical rehabilitation programme , quick traditional non-surgical programme , give tendon re-rupture rate similar surgical treatment . This new rehabilitation programme use walk boot fit heel-raise ( instead traditional plaster ) . The potential benefit quicker rehabilitation programme allow patient put weight leg immediately , whereas patient treated traditional plaster cast non-surgical treatment weight bear ( mean keep non-weightbearing therefore use crutch ) first 8 week . Later programme , also allow patient remove boot undertake supervise exercise physiotherapist , do plaster . Finally , time spend walk boot new , quick rehabilitation programme 8 week spend plaster 10 week . This new non-surgical , quick rehabilitation programme refer accelerated non-surgical programme hereafter . There know increase risk accelerate rehabilitation programme .</detailed_description>
