	<brief_title>A Study Safety Toca 511 , Retroviral Replicating Vector , Combined With Toca FC Subjects With Newly Diagnosed High Grade Glioma Receiving Standard Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-center , open label trial combination therapy Toca 511 ascend dos Toca FC add SOC newly diagnose HGG . Enrolled subject presume newly diagnose HGG undergo plan resection tumor . Subjects HGG receive Toca 511 , administer intracranial parenchymal injection wall resection cavity . This study establish recommend Phase 2 dose Toca FC use combination standard care chemoradiation temozolomide subject newly diagnose HGG . Subjects begin chemoradiation treatment approximately 4 6 week surgery . Oral Toca FC ( 7-day course ) administer concurrent start second sixth week chemoradiation concurrent treatment period , concurrent start temozolomide maintenance treatment period .</detailed_description>
