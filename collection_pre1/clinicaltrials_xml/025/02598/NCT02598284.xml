	<detailed_description>The investigator specific aim : 1 . Evaluate ability small practice investigator region 1 ) implement point-of-care ( POC ) population management ( PM ) quality improvement strategy improve ABCS , 2 ) implement popHealth quality measurement software evaluate performance ABCS allow regional benchmarking . 2 . Conduct practice-randomized trial determine ) whether POC strategy improve ABCS performance measure ( i.e . aspirin prescribing , blood pressure control , cholesterol management , smoke cessation counseling ) compare baseline , b ) whether add locally-tailored PM strategy POC strategy improve performance ABCS measure POC strategy alone . 3 . Deploy open source quality measurement platform ( popHealth ) establish regional QI benchmark base participate practice ABCS measure enable longitudinal track electronic clinical quality measure ( eCQMs ) across investigator region . The investigator perform mixed-methods evaluation examine change practice ' perceive capacity quality improvement whether access comparative quality data within region improve capacity practice sustain quality improvement program around ABCS provide long-term framework practice implement new QI activity .</detailed_description>
