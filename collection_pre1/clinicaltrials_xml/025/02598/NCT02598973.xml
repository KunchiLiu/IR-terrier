	<brief_summary>Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) common neurodegenerative disorder affect approximately 80,000 Veterans , represent priority area VA research . Current medicine PD improve symptom , treatment slow disease progression need , early diagnosis PD may key development . PD symptom mimic medicine ( commonly antipsychotic drug block dopamine ) , patient actually underlie `` prodromal '' PD `` unmasked '' year would cause symptom . This problem increase medicine use common condition include post-traumatic stress disorder depression . The investigator identify prodromal PD patient drug-induced symptom use brain scan . These patient enrol randomized clinical trial aerobic exercise slow progression animal model PD health benefit . The investigator measure effect exercise symptom , disease progression ( use brain scan ) marker PD risk ( use blood test ) . These study improve early PD diagnosis potentially identify way slow progression PD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) incurable neurodegenerative disorder affect approximately 1 million US adult 80,000 Veterans . PD cause significant morbidity due motor non-motor symptom across prolonged course annual economic burden $ 14 billion US alone . Motor symptom associate loss dopaminergic neuron PD may temporarily improve dopamine replace medicine , disease-modifying therapy delay prevent neuronal loss lack sorely need . Exercise promise disease-modifying therapy protect dopaminergic neuron animal model PD associate measure neuroplasticity PD patient . Unfortunately , half dopaminergic neuron substantia nigra lose motor symptom occur make difficult identify patient early enough benefit potentially disease-modifying therapy . Early `` prodromal '' PD identify use non-motor feature include olfactory dysfunction biomarkers dopamine transporter ( DaT ) brain image abnormality apparent year motor symptom . However , strategy would difficult costly implement population level without first identify high-risk individual screen . Commonly prescribed dopamine block antipsychotic drug cause debilitate PD-like motor dysfunction difficult treat , patient find may serve `` stress test '' fail dopaminergic network unmask symptom long would normally appear . Identifying prodromal PD among drug-induced parkinsonism patient offer unique unexplored opportunity early intervention . In proposed study , investigator employ tiered screen strategy inexpensive non-invasive olfactory test drug-induced parkinsonism patient follow DaT image individual olfactory impairment identify cohort patient presume prodromal PD . Subjects presume prodromal PD randomize home-based exercise intervention ( { 5 } time weekly aerobic walking confirm remote activity monitor ) intervention . In cohort , investigator assess : 1 ) Short-term symptomatic effect exercise motor function drug-induced parkinsonism use standard clinical measure ( Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale ) quantitative gait assessment 8 week intervention ; 2 ) potential disease-modifying effect 52 week exercise compare rate change quantitative DaT imaging ; 3 ) mechanism biochemical correlate exercise-induced change use panel serum biomarkers implicate exercise and/or PD risk include brain-derived neurotrophic factor , uric acid , apolipoproteinA1 . Differences rate change group assess use independent sample t-tests linear mixed-effects model adjust age gender . The investigator ' preliminary data demonstrate strong association olfactory impairment abnormal DaT image drug-induced parkinsonism . Based power calculation allow 20 % dropout , investigator screen approximately 250 drug-induced parkinsonism subject use olfactory testing , expectation approximately 88 abnormal DaT imaging agree participate intervention trial . Antipsychotic drug widely prescribe grow list approve indication off-label us include bipolar disorder , depression post-traumatic stress disorder . Studying drug-induced parkinsonism patient prodromal PD allow u identify individual risk , characterize natural history progression evaluate appropriate management strategy earliest stage PD . Exercise putative disease-modifying therapy offer significant advantage include cost , ease access lack toxicity compare unproven pharmacologic intervention especially offer early enough meaningful clinical impact .</detailed_description>
