	<brief_summary>Obesity consider one trouble chronic disease public health rapid growth population . Many causal factor epidemic , recent year study suggest involvement genetic factor etiology obesity risk factor development . Polymorphism FTO gene study past eight year indicate predictor obesity population , well association food intake , raise possibility influence regulation hunger satiety . Accordingly , researcher observe change level postprandial leptin ghrelin , promote appetite change quantity quality food intake subject polymorphism FTO .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Association Between Change FTO Gene With Hormones Food Consumption Obese</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity chronic disease high growth world population , well risk factor development chronic disease . Additionally , know multifactorial disease polygenic , make difficult control . It also recognize environmental factor , emphasis diet , modulate expression certain gene may help control obesity . In recent decade , researcher several country devote study aim propose alternative treatment obesity , emphasize regulation energy balance change lifestyle ( diet exercise ) , try clarify reason individual susceptible factor , favor body weight gain . These difference may explain part , genetic factor . The FTO gene consider strong candidate gene obesity relation secretion ghrelin , important orexigenic hormone involve regulation food intake , could open new perspective study gene-environment interaction obesity . Considering significant increase obesity world population , understood study assess environmental factor - particularly diet - gene genetic variant associate obesity - may represent major breakthrough understand development disease , provide tool propose possible change current dietary prescription population . Also highlight lack study subject , make proposal innovative unprecedented aim evaluate relationship FTO gene polymorphism ghrelin secretion food intake obese . It suggest obese individual polymorphism FTO gene present high serum concentration basal ghrelin postprandial ( after-fat meal ) , usual food intake , well postprandial appetite , associate concentration basal postprandial ghrelin , respectively . These result may generate data change dietary prescription aim reduce secretion , sensitivity hormone control energy intake , whereas individual 's genotype change voluntarily current state art .</detailed_description>
