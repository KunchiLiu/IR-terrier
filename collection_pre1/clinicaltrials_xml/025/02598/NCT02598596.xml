	<brief_title>Tolerization Reduces Intolerance Pegloticase Prolongs Urate Lowering Effect</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This exploratory open-label , multicenter study evaluate effectiveness 16-week high zone tolerance regimen pegloticase response therapy ( serum uric acid &lt; 6 mg/dL ) drug adult hyperuricemic patient gout refractory conventional therapy . Eligible subject weigh &lt; 120 kg receive pegloticase 8 mg intravenously ( IV ) weekly basis ( Week 1 Week 3 - `` Tolerizing Period '' ) , follow 8 mg IV every 2 week Week 17 total 10 dos . Subjects weigh ≥ 120 kg sequentially assign 1 3 different loading dos ( 8 , 12 , 16 mg ) Study Day 1 , receive 8 mg Week 2 3 , follow 8 mg every 2 week Week 17 total 10 dos . Subjects monitor efficacy safety endpoint Week 17 . Subjects also blood drawn pegloticase level prior dose Weeks 2 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 , 11 , 13,15 , 17 . Following Study Week 17 , subject option continue dose additional 8 week . A total 53 subject enrol : 40 subject weigh &lt; 120 kg 13 subject weigh ≥ 120 kg . The study duration , per enrol patient , approximately 26 week include 2-week screening period , 16-week treatment period ( end treatment [ EOT ] visit Week 17 ) , optional 8-week dosing extension .</detailed_description>
