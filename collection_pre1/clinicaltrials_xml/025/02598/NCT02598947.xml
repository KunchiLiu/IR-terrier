	<brief_title>The Effectiveness Treatment Posterior Shoulder Tightness : A Feasibility Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study randomise , control , double blind ( patient assessor ) , parallel group , feasibility study 1:1 allocation ratio . The patient assess inclusion/exclusion criterion randomly allocate one two group . Both group receive exercise educational intervention . The treatment group also receive specific intervention posterior shoulder tightness ; placebo group receive placebo posterior shoulder tightness intervention . Study set The study take place secondary care environment . Subjects recruit outpatient orthopaedic clinic Worthing Southlands Hospitals , part Western Sussex Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust . Recruitment Recruitment promote flier research poster outpatients department . The chief investigator research assistant attend orthopaedic shoulder clinic approach patient wait area introduce study hand flier . The orthopaedic team also introduce study patient appropriate introduce patient chief investigator research assistant patient express interest receive information relate study . Where appropriate chief investigator research assistant ask patient would willing contacted chief investigator follow day discuss study . If patient detail pass chief investigator call patient least 24 hour introduction study . The chief investigator call discus study patient happy participate appointment arrange patient attend physiotherapy department either Worthing Southlands hospital . At time informed consent , eligibility assessment baseline outcome measurement perform . In addition baseline characteristic record attempt minimize selection bias . The estimated time visit 90 minute . Randomisation Blinding Prior subject randomisation , seal envelope prepared contain treatment manual two treatment arm . The assessor assign consent participant unique study number anonymised data forward name research officer Brighton Sussex Clinical Trials Unit ( B &amp; S CTU ) . The officer enter data software package 'sealed envelope ' process data assign subject treatment placebo group . An E-mail containing group allocation send assessor . The patient transfer reception physiotherapy department appropriately number envelop place physiotherapy note patient book initial physiotherapy session . The group allocation patient available treat physiotherapist envelope contain manual open initial physiotherapy consultation . The physiotherapist instruct advise patient group allocate . Data collection Data collection take place prior random allocation , half way intervention ( 6-8 week ) end intervention ( 13-15 week ) . At 26 52 week telephone follow-up interview repeat collection Shoulder pain Disability Index ( SPADI ) EuroQol questionnaire ( EQ-5D-5L ) evaluate surgical outcome . The chief investigator perform data collection , assistant accompany assist measurement posterior shoulder tightness . The assessor blind group allocation participant . Where possible participant complete questionnaire unassisted , assistance require additional explanation provide research assistant . Physical data collect form clinical examination baseline , 6-8 week 13-15 week . The examination involve measurement posterior shoulder tightness use three clinical test . These test perform measurement brace digital inclinometer . A reliability study three clinical test perform chief investigator University Brighton follow approval Faculty Health Sciences Research Ethics Governance Committee . The three clinical test identify patient posterior shoulder tightness ; horizontal adduction , internal rotation 90 degree abduction low flexion . Physiotherapy intervention The treatment intervention deliver physiotherapy outpatient department Worthing Hospital Southlands Hospital . Treatment deliver NHS physiotherapist 13-15 week consist 6-8 session physiotherapy . The first 4 session deliver weekly subsequent 4 session deliver every 2 week . This treatment dose duration consistent previous high quality study ( Holmgren et al . 2014 , Bernhardsson et al . 2011 ) . The intervention deliver patient surgical wait list subacromial decompression surgery . The current wait time surgery vary considerably consultant , 18-28 week . This mean intervention fully complete waiting time surgery . All treatment provide NHS physiotherapist part daily caseload . They allocate 45 minute initial assessment 30 minute subsequent treatment session , line current departmental procedure . All therapist recruit trial voluntary basis . Appropriate training provide physiotherapist . It estimate 2 physiotherapist three physiotherapy site require deliver physiotherapy intervention . For group , physiotherapy treatment consist education regard nature patient condition , prescription exercise program perform day home . Each group perform three strengthen exercise address muscular system scapular rotator cuff musculature stretch exercise anterior shoulder . The exercise select base review available literature relate muscular dysfunction shoulder impingement , electromyography ( EMG ) study shoulder exercise RCTs intervention adequately describe . The exercise teach physiotherapist review session exercise progress regressed depend patient response since last visit . In addition subject allocate 'posterior shoulder tightness ' treatment group also receive specific manual therapy physiotherapy session . The treatment design mobilise structure posterior shoulder . They prescribe home stretch address stiffness posterior shoulder . The 'sham posterior shoulder tightness ' group receive home stretch manual therapy similar duration 'posterior shoulder tightness ' group , deliver structure know direct structural influence posterior shoulder . The intention subject receive similar dose manual therapy control generic effect manual therapy , may pain relieve mechanism . The sham intervention control time attention order create comparable attention-control group . Using design may possible determine additional benefit treat posterior shoulder tightness combination high quality rehabilitation patient shoulder impingement syndrome . All subject ask perform 4 strengthen exercise day 2 stretch day well attend 6-8 physiotherapy treatment 13-15 week period . The exercise take approximately 10-15 minute perform . The study design feasibility study believe many unknown factor proceed directly definitive randomise control study design . These outline full section 11A . It predict recruitment begin May 2016 continue November 2018 . Final follow-up assessment occur one year initial outcome assessment . So predicted final patient contact occur October/November 2019 . The study design discuss depth user group conception June 2013 two patient representative continue assist throughout study design . Patients review recruitment strategy , patient information literature consent form . They agree participate inform consent rehearsal appraisal prior start recruitment ensure informed consent thorough easy patient comprehend allow sufficient time question . The study steer committee meet every 6 month ensure study run smoothly . The steer committee include ; Kevin Hall ( lead researcher ) , Chris Mercer ( Physiotherapy Consultant , physiotherapy clinical lead ) , Professor Ann Moore ( academic supervisor , member academic supervisory team ) , Mr Nurang ( Orthopaedic Shoulder Consultant ) , Richard Brunton ( service user ) , Pamela Clarke ( service user ) , Clare Meachin ( Research Innovation Department ) Physiotherapist ( confirm ) . Progress report submit National Institute Health Research ( NIHR ) 6 month annually 5 year duration study .</detailed_description>
