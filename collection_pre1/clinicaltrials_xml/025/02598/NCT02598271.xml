	<detailed_description>Acute kidney injury ( AKI ) infrequent major well - recognize complication cardiac surgery ( 1 , 2 ) . Its incidence range 1 30 % ( 3 ) . Numerous pre- , intra- , postoperative factor associate development AKI cardiac surgery ( 3-19 ) . Most commonly used definition absolute serum creatinine level , change within one week and/or need dialysis previously undialysed patient ( 1 , 3-5 , 9-11 , 19-25 ) . In patient old , obese Type 2 diabetes hypertension , increase interest effect chronic kidney disease cardiovascular system ( 26 ) . Recent study demonstrate even minimal increase serum creatinine associate rise risk mortality , hospital length stay , cost ( 27 , 28 ) . The Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative Group standardize Risk , Injury , Failure , Loss Kidney Function , End-Stage Kidney Disease criterion modification Acute Kidney Injury Network criterion definition AKI ( 19 , 29 , 30 ) . Both criterion need baseline serum creatinine value estimation ( 31 ) . In recent publish study ( 32 ) cut-off baseline serum creatinine influence mortality cardiac surgery show . Under steady-state stable kidney function , SCr usually produce relatively constant rate body depend absolute amount muscle mass , reliable cost-effective surrogate marker kidney function ( 33 ) . SCr strongly correlate weight , total body water anthropometrically estimate lean body mass ( LBM ) ( 34 ) . Approximately half LBM comprise skeletal muscle mass ( 35 ) . Recent study suggest high muscle mass associate great longevity people CKD chronic disease state ( 36 , 37 ) . SCr , however , several limitation , variation concentration relate age , sex , muscle mass influence dietary protein intake . ( 38 ) Furthermore AKI affect different complex cellular molecular pathway . Several novel urinary biomarkers insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7 ( IGFBP7 ) , tissue inhibitor metalloproteinases-2 ( TIMP-2 ) neutral endopeptidase ( NEP ) involve early phase cell injury predict development severity AKI renal recovery early cardiac surgery ( 39-43 ) In study investigator want test increase bSCr influence body composition . Further investigator want determine incidence AKI different patient estimate cut-off . Therefore investigator want perform prospective cohort analysis take several body composition nutrition parameter test influence predictive power bSCr . Furthermore investigator want evaluate several novel biomarkers AKI predictive effect cardiac surgical patient .</detailed_description>
