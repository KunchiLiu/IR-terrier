	<brief_title>Validation Aspiration Markers Intubated Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At present standard method evaluation vivo cuff leak aspiration . Most tested technique major pitfall render routine application infeasible . Lacking practical reliable marker , possible intervention aim improve cuff seal ETT performance order reduce VAP occurrence go hindered inability truly evaluate efficacy . Radio-labeled marker expensive , expose patient considerable radiological risk , require transport radiological department , would expose critically ill patient additional risk . Dyes potential give useful information presence cuff leak , due persistent stain secretion , allow continuous monitoring aspiration . Amylase detection could good marker aspiration , ability detect aspiration poor even compare pepsin . Pepsin bile acid potential detect aspiration cuff leak happen daily mechanically ventilated patient , due gastrointestinal nature , offer kind information aspiration contaminate oropharyngeal secretion . With research protocol , investigator would like validate use Quinine , FD &amp; C ( food drug cosmetic ) Blue N. 1 FD &amp; C Red N. 3 suspend sterile water marker determine cuff leakage aspiration event ICU population compare efficacy identify aspiration event pepsin detection . Quinine , Bue Red food dye compound commonly use food manufacturing . Their pharmacokinetics -dynamics extensively study . The chemical structure molecules allow detection pico-molar concentration spectrophotometry . The investigator challenge oropharyngeal cavity know concentration Quinine , Red Blue food dye suspend sterile water . The investigator hypothesize detection spectrophotometry substance tracheal secretion prove aspiration . The investigator specific aim : 1 . To quantify measurement Quinine , Red Blue food dye tracheal sample compare pepsin measurement sample . 2 . To assess association amount oropharyngeal aspiration development upper low respiratory complication ( i.e . ventilator associate pneumonia [ VAP ] , tracheobronchitis , ventilator-associated event , acute respiratory distress syndrome [ ARDS ] , etc. ) . 3 . To determine patient 's risk factor associate oropharyngeal aspiration . The introduction new , safe inexpensive marker evaluate ETT cuff performance detect aspiration improve design future study aim VAP prevention .</detailed_description>
