	<brief_summary>This clinical trial men advance prostate cancer may spread part body . Currently , prostate cancer cell spread prostate organ treatable surgery . The purpose study treat patient experimental antibody ( i.e . FDA approve ) call J591 attache special protein cancer cell call PSMA try eliminate cancer cell ( call circulate tumor cell ) circulation . In initial phase study , 6 participant receive experimental J591 treatment . Routine blood test , research blood test , physical exam perform visit . Participants also ask complete questionnaire feeling . Participants radiographic scan every 3 month check status disease . Participants tolerate treatment well may re-treated level every 3 month , may continue treatment long respond therapy experience unacceptable side effect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>J591 Patients With Advanced Prostate Cancer Unfavorable Circulating Tumor Cell Counts</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>J591 de-immunized monoclonal antibody extracellular domain prostate-specific membrane antigen ( PSMA ) . Background data demonstrate mAb Hu-J591 dos low 20 mg may lead decrease CTCs dose 300 mg safe . With goal establish less frequent , potentially convenient cost-effective future therapy , investigator propose single-center , open-label , dose de-escalation study determine effect mAb Hu-J591 circulate tumor cell subject metastatic PC . Four dose level plan minimum 6 maximum 24 subject enrollment start single infusion 300 mg mAb Hu-J591 . In initial phase study cohort 6 subject receive 300 mg mAb Hu-J591 blood sample collect pre post-infusion detection CTCs , PSA assess hematological toxicity screening , baseline , week 1 , week 4 , week 8 , week 12 . In addition , patient receive dose 89Zr-DFO-huJ591 ( 5 mCi ) 2-4 week prior treatment undergo 89Zr-DFO-huJ591 PET image 1-3 week pre-treatment ( optional ) well repeat 89Zr-DFO-huJ591 infusion ( 5 mCi ) 11 week PET/CT image 12 week ( optional ) . If less four subject respond drop CTC count equal 5 CTCs/7.5 mL whole blood le 5 CTCs/7.5 mL whole blood initial cohort , trial end dose . If four subject respond , additional 6 subject accrue second dose level ( 200 mg ) . The decision rule apply evaluate two additional low dose level ( 100 mg , 50 mg ) 6 subject enrol cohort . Imaging study perform prior treatment screen 3 month clinically indicate assess disease response . Subjects tolerate initial infusion well ( &lt; grade 2 toxicity ) may re-treated every 3 month ( 12 week ) dose-level progression .</detailed_description>

If third measurement great second measurement , fourth measurement must take ; fourth measurement must great second measurement subject eligible enrollment study . Furthermore , confirmatory PSA measurement ( i.e. , third , applicable , fourth PSA measurement ) must 2 ng/mL ≥ 25 % previous nadir . Subjects must remain stable hormonal therapy regimen . Subjects receive traditional antiandrogen ( i.e . bicalutamide , nilutamide , flutamide ) therapy result PSA decline must continue antiandrogen therapy demonstrate progression follow discontinuation antiandrogen therapy ( necessary never respond antiandrogen addition ) . Medical surgical castration continue duration trial subject . Subjects measure progression androgen receptor signal inhibitor ( enzalutamide ) CYP17 inhibitor ( abiraterone acetate ) wish continue must remain stable regimen .
