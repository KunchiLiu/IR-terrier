	<brief_summary>The investigator propose post-exercise milk protein feed enhance mitochondrial protein synthesis ( biogenesis ) response exercise-training program . In addition , investigator propose stimulatory effect protein feed overcome potential blunting effect metformin exercise response . The investigator investigate outcome 12-week exercise-training program old adult pre-diabetes without metformin treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Milk Protein Feeding After Aerobic Exercise Older Adults With Pre-diabetes Taking Biguanide Metformin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , placebo control , double blind study . 60 men woman age 55 indication pre-diabetes recruit participation randomly assign one four 12 week exercise training program : 1 ) Supervised aerobic exercise 3 day per week follow carbohydrate drink along daily oral administration Metformin . 2 ) Supervised aerobic exercise 3 day per week follow protein drink along daily oral administration Metformin . 3 ) Supervised aerobic exercise 3 day per week follow carbohydrate drink along daily oral administration match placebo . 4 ) Supervised aerobic exercise 3 day per week follow protein drink along daily oral administration placebo . Daily administration Metformin begin one 500 mg tablet first week increase 500 mg/day/week reaching 2000 mg/day week 4 12 week exercise training program . The titration dose scheme take metformin/placebo meal help reduce common side effect ( i.e. , gastrointestinal discomfort ) . If participant experience gastrointestinal discomfort , dose lowered 1500 mg/day .</detailed_description>
