	<brief_summary>Micronutrient deficiency people live HIV report . Multivitamins address micronutrient deficiency , however benefit multivitamin people live HIV still debatable . While multivitamin intervention study report benefit multivitamin HIV infection , study report statistical difference outcomes interest intervention control group . With clear difference composition strength multivitamin use different study , possible multivitamin use intervention study may unable meet existing micronutrient deficiency . Hence chance high strength multivitamin may better able correct deficiency result good outcome . This study therefore compare three different multivitamin vary strength composition determine one three multivitamin produce good health outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The link micronutrient deficiency advance HIV disease report . Micronutrient deficiency people live HIV/AIDS ( PLWHA ) link reduce antioxidant level oxidative stress . In turn oxidative stress believe promote HIV disease progression . The use multivitamins PLWHA therefore potential cut interconnection micronutrient deficiency HIV disease progression . If beneficial , multivitamin use PLWHA could result improved health outcome . A number study explore possibility different result . Differences multivitamin strength composition could responsible different result . Therefore , likely increase strength composition intervention multivitamin could possibly produce single result improve health outcome across board . Hence study determine multivitamins high strength cause good health outcome study participant compare low strength multivitamin . Multivitamin A compose 7 vitamin recommend daily allowance ( RDA ) , multivitamin B make 22 micronutrient RDA multivitamin C make 22 micronutrient 3 time RDA . These multivitamin administer 190 study participant double blind randomize control study determine would significant difference health outcome participant 6 month multivitamin use . All multivitamin regardless composition manufacture look identical package identical container . This double blind randomize control study conduct HIV treatment center Nigerian Institute Medical Research Lagos State University Teaching Hospital , Lagos Nigeria . At design stage study , feasibility study carry HIV treatment center assess practicability potential success study . Following successful feasibility study , ethical approval apply obtained institution .</detailed_description>
