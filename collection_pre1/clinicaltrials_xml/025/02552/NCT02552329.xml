	<brief_summary>Most research Tai Chi do area balance fall . Studies examine effect Tai Chi exercise cognitive function sparse especially population MCI . Therefore , aim present study : 1 ) examine effect Tai Chi exercise cognitive function elderly MCI , 2 ) investigate effect 6-month Tai Chi exercise serum biomarkers individual MCI .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Mild Cognitive Impairment ( MCI ) transitional stage convert normal age dementia . Older adult MCI 10 time likely develop dementia cognitively intact old adult . Thus , strategy could deter conversion MCI dementia significant impact public health . There grow interest non-pharmacological approach could potentially slow cognitive decline late life . One approach use exercise improve cognitive function . There substantial evidence exercise benefit cognitive function elderly person . Evidence benefit exercise cognition ( either cognitive improvement reduce cognitive decline ) demonstrate epidemiological study , meta-analytical study , randomize controlled trial . Although exercise training hold promise delaying onset slow progression cognitive impairment among elderly person , study utilize aerobic-base exercise relatively high intensity . High intensity aerobic exercise may practical old people likely physical limitation and/or co-morbid diseases.Thus , effect form exercise particularly less intense well suit elderly condition examine . The moderating factor link exercise training cognitive improvement yet investigate . Tai Chi , form mind-body exercise , popular exercise among elderly . Although Tai Chi consider aerobic exercise , focus exercise elder cardiovascular fitness . It characterize slow , gentle motion emphasize conscious control body movement . Several cognitive component include attention mindfulness engage physical movement Tai Chi exercise . Thus , expect Tai Chi exercise would great benefit cognition . Most research Tai Chi do area balance fall . Studies examine effect Tai Chi exercise cognitive function sparse especially population mild cognitive impairment .</detailed_description>
