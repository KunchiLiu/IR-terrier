	<brief_summary>Multicentre , double-armed , randomize control trial design compare mitral valve leaflet resection versus leaflet preservation regard development functional mitral stenosis follow surgical repair mitral valve prolapse . Patients randomize ( 1:1 ) receive : ( 1 ) mitral valve repair leaflet resection ( 2 ) mitral valve repair leaflet preservation ( use polytetrafluoroethylene neochordae ) , follow echocardiographic clinical assessment 12-months following surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Mitral valve repair emerge preferred surgical treatment mitral valve prolapse ( MVP ) , condition wherein mitral valve close properly . One common strategy mitral valve repair leaflet resection , involve remove part one mitral leaflet flop bulge back ( prolapse ) . Another strategy leaflet preservation , involve place man-made fiber ( suture ) securely connect mitral leaflet papillary muscle ( muscle locate ventricle ) . While strategy routinely use lead successful mitral valve repair , clear evidence whether one strategy well term long term outcome . The purpose study determine one repair strategy ( leaflet resection versus leaflet preservation ) lead well long term patient outcomes . A total 88 patient 6 Canadian centre randomly assign one two strategy . The primary outcome functional mitral stenosis ( MS ) assess 12-month mean mitral valve pressure gradient peak exercise .</detailed_description>
