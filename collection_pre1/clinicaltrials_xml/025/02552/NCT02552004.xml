	<brief_title>Assessment Intraoperative Probe-based Confocal Laser Endomicroscopy Digestive Endocrine Surgery : Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intraoperative histological examination fundamental tool cancer surgery ( extent surgery , resection margin , sentinel lymph node ) necessary circumstance like redo surgery endocrine surgery . Using conventional frozen section technique result prolongation operate time 40 minute . Probe-based Confocal Laser Endomicroscopy ( pCLE ) new image technique enable real-time , microscope-resolution imaging . Specifically , intravenous injection fluorescent contrast agent - study fluorescein use , pCLE system provide video sequence tissue , use confocal microscope integrate miniprobe low power laser illumination source ( CellvizioÂ® , Mauna Kea Technologies , Paris , France ) . The pCLE currently use endoscopy , mainly follow-up Barrett 's esophagus , colorectal polyp stricture bile pancreatic duct , also urology . The pCLE never test open video-assisted surgery setting . Sterilizable probe exist certify use via endoscope France ( UHD CystoFlexTM , AQ-FLEX 19TM Mauna Kea Technologies , Paris , France ) . A probe ( CelioFlex UHDTM ) currently develop use laparoscopic surgery setting . This pilot study aim evaluate pCLE surgical setting . Each anatomical structure correspond specific tissue architecture , today know standard histological examination . Conventional histology implies alteration tissue architecture , ablation blood supply , sample technical treatment sample ( fixation , cut , stain ) . The pCLE enable bypass process allow obtain image microscopic structure vivo , without cell damage without interruption blood lymphatic circulation . The obtained video sequence reflect microscopic architecture , form date , neither map exploit deep organ . The potential technique demonstrate intraabdominal organ animal model , encourage result sensitivity specificity pCLE superior standard histological examination . The primary objective depiction histological render normal pathological tissue pCLE . Feasibility real-time diagnosis also assess . All surgical condition usually necessitate frozen section investigate . A total 30 patient , various pathology thyroid / parathyroid , stomach , esophagus , pancreas , adrenal , colon / small intestine , liver include . The installation surgical opening perform accord standard protocol . A contrast agent , fluorescein , inject intravenously allow tissue visualization pCLE . During surgery , surgeon perform pCLE examination , obtain record video sequence situ structure . Frozen section obtain sample guide surgical decision-making . Diagnostic criterion define surgeon - pathologist team validate retrospective analysis sequence comparison conventional histology slide . The data use create image bank reference optical biopsy image . The study allow point surgical condition pCLE effective reliable could eventually replace frozen section technique . A second study , comparative prospective setting , could focus promising condition order evaluate diagnosis accuracy statistical basis .</detailed_description>
