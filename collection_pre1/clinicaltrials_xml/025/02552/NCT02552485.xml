	<brief_title>Evaluation Latent Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Congenital Shunt Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) patient congenital heart disease ( CHD ) usually develop secondary chronic volume overload pulmonary circulation follow leave right shunt . This overload lead elevate pulmonary artery pressure ( PAP ) later increase pulmonary vascular resistance ( PVR ) . This cause pressure overload right heart , thereby right ventricular ( RV ) right atrial ( RA ) dysfunction , may implicate considerable morbidity even mortality . Since PAH nowadays mostly detect symptom occur PAP elevate , disease already evolve advanced ( partially irreversible ) stage treatment often initiate late . Dismissal follow-up surgical correction simple CHD customize seventy eighty . There literature available learn u whether patient really need follow-up . A substantial number must insidiously develop PAH mild pulmonary vascular disease ( PVD ) still prone develop PAH later life . It relevant recall patient dismiss follow-up past , might carry lot useful information natural history PAH development . Focus lie mainly patient simple shunt lesion , atrial septal defect ( ASD ) ventricular septal defect ( VSD ) .</detailed_description>
