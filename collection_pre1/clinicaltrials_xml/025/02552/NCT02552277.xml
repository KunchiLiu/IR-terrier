	<brief_summary>This Phase 2 , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , dose range find study subject diabetic peripheral neuropathy ( DPN ) . The study enroll approximately 24 subject . Subjects randomize receive one 3 treatment : PDA-002 ( 3 x 10^6 cell ) , PDA-002 ( 30 x 10^6 cell ) , placebo ( vehicle control ) 1:1:1 randomization approach . Investigational product placebo administer monthly ( 3 administration total Study Days 1 , 29 , 57 ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Efficacy Safety Study Intramuscular Injection Human Placenta-Derived Cells ( PDA-002 ) Subjects With Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects undergo Screening Period ( 28 day duration ) determine study eligibility baseline level sign symptom diabetic peripheral neuropathy ( DPN ) establish . Subjects enter Treatment Period ( 6 month duration ) . During Treatment Period , subject evaluate ongoing basis ( 8 schedule study visit ) . Subjects receive intramuscular ( IM ) injection investigational product ( IP ) Study Days 1 , 29 , 57 fifteen 0.30 mL injection ( knee ankle ) one low extremity blind manner . After complete Treatment Period , subject enter Follow-up Period continue evaluate schedule study visit subsequent month . An analysis study data occur last subject complete Visit 9 ( Month 6 ) last scheduled study visit .</detailed_description>
