	<brief_title>The Treatment Insomnia Comorbid With Sleep Disordered Breathing Using Armodafinil and/or Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Insomnia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Insomnia sleep disordered breathing common sleep disorder tend highly comorbid . When co‐occur , increase cumulative morbidity , likely two disease interact : promote overall great illness severity ; reduce treatment adherence ; diminish treatment efficacy . The result propose project provide valuable information co‐treatment two disorder promote improved sleep quantity , enhance sleep quality , good compliance Positive Airway Pressure ( PAP ) therapy , good daytime functioning . Background : There substantial evidence Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Insomnia ( CBT‐I ) efficacious Primary Insomnia ( PI ) , potent sedative hypnotic treatment , well sustain time . Further , increase evidence CBT‐I apply insomnias co‐morbid medical psychiatric disorder , equal efficacy . The evidence expand indication , date , insomnia comorbid depression , chronic pain , cancer . Interestingly , study efficacy CBT‐I insomnia comorbid intrinsic sleep disorder , include patient Sleep Disordered Breathing ( SDB ) . This surprising give insomnia frequently occur comorbidly SDB . It estimate 40‐60 % patient SDB also suffer insomnia . The lack data regard applicability CBT‐I insomnia co‐morbid SDB likely due concern CBT‐I difficult tolerate patient insomnia co‐morbid SDB give treatment 's tendency produce acute increase fatigue , sleepiness , transient reduction attention performance . Accordingly , investigator study propose conduct randomize , control trial effect Armodafinil alone combination CBT‐I patient Insomnia comorbid SDB . Note : The choice evaluate Armodafinil monotherapy adjuvant therapy CBT‐I insomnia firm conceptual basis support preliminary data group . The choice evaluate Armodafinil patient insomnia co‐morbid SDB support exist indication sleepiness patient SDB .</detailed_description>
