	<brief_title>Energy Expenditure ICU Patients Using Predictive Formulas Various Body Weights Versus Indirect Calorimetry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several clinical study show energy deficit well overfeed lead increase risk complication , especially infection , increase mortality . The gold standard determine energy expenditure intensive care patient indirect calorimetry . This method expensive require trained team use . In addition reliability measurement depend clinical situation may feasible ( e.g . inspiratory O2 fraction &gt; 60 % , end expiratory pressure &gt; 9cmH2O , presence bronchial gap , etc. ) . Moreover , long market valid indirect calorimeter clinical use mechanically ventilated patient , maintenance old valid one ( Deltatrac IIÂ® ) become increasingly problematic lack spare part . Intensivists choice use prediction equation energy expenditure base imprecise anthropometric data ( height , weight ) . Especially obese malnourish patient intensive care body weight represent reliable data . Similarly , secondary water inflation due metabolic stress resuscitation complicate determination real body weight . The difficulty know weight use predictive equation . Due paucity literature subject , currently consensus reference weight use determination nutritional need medication dos . So prescriber calculates energy target take reference weight base conviction . This study part quality process care practice harmonization , aim identify reference weight use best suit predictive equation , predict energy expenditure patient benefit indirect calorimetry .</detailed_description>
