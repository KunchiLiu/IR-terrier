	<brief_summary>Contamination implant abutment could potentially influence peri-implant tissue inflammatory response . The aim present study assess radiographic bone change around customize , platform switch , abutment place accord `` one-abutment-one-time '' protocol , without plasma argon cleaning treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Plasma Argon Cleaning Implant Abutments : 5-year Results Randomized Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After technical procedure , presence contaminant ( mostly Titanium wear micro-particles , Carbon Aluminum trace due lubricant use customization ) whole abutment surface , internal connection screw find , even usually clean step ( steam ) . Such debris , present titanium/connective-bone tissue interface ( gingival portion abutment ) , could directly indirectly deleteriously influence inflammatory response peri-implant tissue . Plasma Argon clean treatment demonstrate double effect titanium abutment : removal pollution follow customization increase cell adhesion . Additionally , Plasma Argon demonstrate potent anti-biofilm activity . This prospective , match pair , triple-blinded randomize controlled trial aim test plasma treatment customized abutment affect radiographic peri-implant marginal bone level change 5 year prosthetic loading .</detailed_description>
