	<brief_summary>The aim study compare effect spinal stabilization body awareness addition brace wear versus classical exercise subjective verticality perception , trunk symmetry quality life AIS . Study include 30 AIS patient age 14.40±201 year ( stabilization group ) , 14.2±2 year ( Body awareness ) 13.60±1.65 ( classical ) . Cobb angle , rotation , subjective visual ( SVV ) , postural ( SPV ) haptic ( SHV ) deformity perception , quality life assess baseline 10th week treatment . Cobb angle decrease stabilization awareness group . Rotation decrease three group . SVV improve group . SPV SHV , body asymmetry cosmetic deformity improve stabilization awareness group . Only function improve stabilization treatment . Stabilization body awareness exercise create positive change AIS .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In patient idiopathic scoliosis ( IS ) , addition curve progression many problem include altered posture , gait deviation , muscular imbalance , functional limitation , back pain , negative physico-social , body image effect , severe case pulmonary symptom commonly occur . To cope complication , conservative treatment adolescent idiopathic scoliosis ( AIS ) involve variety brace method exercise . Spinal brace important treatment option prevent curve progression moderate curve ( 20-40 ) severe curve AIS . Bracing success rate report 80 % long term level evidence still low . In literature , exercise recommended reduce progression , improve spine thoracic cage flexibility , muscle elasticity strength , correct postural behavior , neuro-motor control , spine stability . In general , traditional exercise ( TE ) include stretch , strengthen exercise spinal musculature , postural training , respiratory exercise use many year IS . Besides traditional exercise , several exercise concept include SEAS , Schroth , Dobomed , Side Shift method ... etc . Effectiveness exercise still debate need study , investigate role specific exercise scoliosis conservative treatment . In scoliosis , muscle imbalance , deficiency muscle ability stabilize posture , loss balance pelvis-spine relation due lateral tilt body postural control impairment result problem define . In addition , tree dimensional scoliotic deformity cause sensory disturbance , stand instability gait modification . Core stabilization exercise ( CSE ) describe therapy technique improve neuromuscular control , strength trunk stabilization muscle , endurance postural muscle , trunk mobilization muscle around spine , balance pelvis spine order maintain functional stability postural control . It indicate literature patient AIS exhibit disturbance vertical perception . Postural vertical line important person perceive body orientation space thereby provide maintain upright posture gait . Body Awareness Therapy ( BAT ) mind-body approach , aim improve body awareness , body posture , quality movement , balance , postural control integrate slow movement co-ordination breathing exercise . BAT program also contain stretch exercise , relax exercise gait training . Patients instructed concentrate body vertical line movement think initiate body center . BAT study many medical condition include back pain , anxiety , fibromyalgia , eat disorder , heart disease , fall elderly . However , limited study determine CSE effect patient scoliosis : one report improvement Cobb 's angle pain sit balance lumbar stabilization exercise . There research examine effect BAT scoliosis . However reason mention , hypothesize CSE BAT therapy positive effect postural re-alignment trunk deformity patient AIS . The aim study investigate effect core stabilization body awareness exercise versus traditional exercise addition brace wear vertical perception , trunk asymmetry , cosmetic deformity health relate quality life patient AIS . The aim study compare effect spinal stabilization body awareness exercise addition brace wear versus traditional exercise subjective verticality perception , trunk symmetry , cosmetic deformity health relate quality life Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis ( AIS ) . This study include 30 AIS patient age 14,40 ± 2,01 year ( stabilization group ) , 14,2 ± 2 year ( Body awareness group ) 13,60 ± 1,65 ( classical group ) . Following record demographic data , bone maturation level accord Riser , curve type accord King , spinal region , include curve , record . Cobb angle antero-posterior X-ray , rotation degree scoliometer Adam 's forward bend test , subjective visual ( SVV ) , postural ( SPV ) haptic ( SHV ) verticality perception laser stick system , cosmetic deformity perception patient , family physiotherapist accord Walter Reed Visual Assessment Scale ( WRVAS ) , trunk asymmetry Posterior Trunk Asymmetry Index ( POTSI ) health relate quality life SRS-22 assess baseline 10th week treatment .</detailed_description>
