	<brief_summary>Pectus excavatum ( PE ) , common congenital chest wall deformity , require surgical repair degree deformity severe . Currently , Pectus Index ( PI ) use classify PE severity . Calculation PI require cross-sectional image chest , usually compute tomography ( CT ) Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) , obtain necessary measurement . However , CT deliver high dose ionize radiation , carry cumulative long-term risk malignancy MRI costly . The purpose study develop method whereby accurate chest wall measurement obtain quantify PE severity without need cross-sectional imaging .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Non-invasive Clinical Pectus Index Measurement Severity Pectus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective study . The study population consist 2 group . The first group ( PE Group ) consist patient present Johns Hopkins All Children 's Hospital ( JHACH ) Pediatric Surgery Cardiac Surgery Clinics outpatient clinic system Johns Hopkins Hospital evaluation pectus excavatum . The second group ( Control Group ) age gender match patient present Radiology department JHACH undergo CT chest indication chest wall deformity . Clinical caliper measurement take used calculate Clinical PI . The step obtain clinical caliper measurement follow : With subject lying , ruler place across chest second ruler use measure depth deep point sternum . The 2nd ruler use measure height horizontal ruler bed side . All measurement make end expiration . With subject standing , measure tape place around chest point deep sternal depression . The sternum , spine bilateral lateral chest location mark temporary ink . The tape keep level possible . Chest caliper use measure deep point sternum posterior midline , posterior midline anterior chest transverse chest diameter . Each measurement take end expiration . The circumference chest record . Each set measurement take 2 independent member research team . Attempts make record amount time take obtain measurement . Consent obtain photograph process illustrative purpose . Every attempt make conceal patient 's identity exclude face photograph . In instance face able exclude , facial feature blur . Clinical measurement may record routine medical care provider 's discretion . However , measurement consider research procedure purpose trial . A copy measurement place medical chart subject evaluate PE provider 's future reference . Measurements obtain Control group strictly purpose research protocol . All subject , regardless group , provide standard care medical condition . All CT MRI perform PE Control group review PI determine single , blinded radiologist . The radiologist determine PI may interpret radiologist responsibility provide comprehensive interpretation study . The PI determine research radiologist record separately subject 's EMR research file . Having single , blind radiologist determine PI entire research cohort allow consistency determine PI , gold standard compare clinical measurement .</detailed_description>
