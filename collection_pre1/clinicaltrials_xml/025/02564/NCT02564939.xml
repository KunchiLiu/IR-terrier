	<detailed_description>Delirium common condition associate significant complication hospitalize adult . The manifestation delirium result disturbance brain functioning , cause include wide array illness , intoxication , stress . Delirium estimate affect 20-50 % hospitalized patient , associate long hospital stay ( 2x ) , great likelihood discharge nursing home ( 2x ) , high rate death ( 2x ) . 20 % delirium admission . Patients experience delirium may persistent confusion ( cognitive impairment ) . In 20 % , confusion appear permanent . Treatment delirium unsatisfactory . Once develops , therapy intervention demonstrate meaningful reduction delirium associate complication . Prevention clearly prefer goal . Based limited report , ramelteon appear promise prevention . Ramelteon , FDA approve ( 2005 ) nonscheduled prescription hypnotic agent , generally consider safe effective serious associate side effect , limitation duration use . It related melatonin action share sleep promote effect ( reduce sleep latency ) improvement coordination circadian cycle . A recent randomized placebo-controlled single blind trial ramelteon treat 33 patient ramelteon 8 mg/d . The researcher report ramelteon associate dramatically low risk delirium ( 3 % vs 32 % ; P = .003 ) , relative risk 0.09 . Estimates time develop delirium delay ramelteon compare placebo , frequency delirium significantly low ramelteon compare placebo ( P = .002 ) . There significant limitation study , however , include high exclusion rate ( 1059 1126 [ 94 % ] patient assess exclude ) , 24+ hour delay initiation study agent , small sample size , unclear sample bias . The investigator propose clinical trial ramelteon prevent delirium patient admit Hartford Hospital . Hartford Hospital unique position conduct study establish ADAPT program systematically apply best practice assessment management delirium . A registry patient screen contains screen result ( 1.5 million CAM screen nearly 91,000 patient ) . Our study permit u evaluate recent limited research finding regard ramelteon large general adult hospitalize population , evaluate potential benefit treatment start earlier course hospitalization .</detailed_description>
