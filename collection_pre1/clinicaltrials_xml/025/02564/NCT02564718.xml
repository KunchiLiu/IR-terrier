	<brief_title>Rivaroxaban Treatment Venous Arterial Thrombosis Neonates</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neonates infant age less 6 month pass screen in- exclusion criterion , treat least five day heparin /or VKA confirm symptomatic asymptomatic arterial venous thrombosis eligible study . Study treatment consist 7-day treatment age- body weight-adjusted twice daily oral rivaroxaban dose achieve similar exposure observe adult treat venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) 20 mg rivaroxaban daily . Rivaroxaban provide granule preparation oral suspension ( 1 mg/mL re-suspension ) use b.i.d . regimen 12-hour interval . An ultrasound perform start rivaroxaban treatment day 1 end rivaroxaban treatment day 8 . The last dose rivaroxaban treatment follow 30-day post study treatment period , regardless duration study drug administration . After cessation rivaroxaban , investigator 's discretion continue anticoagulant . The principal safety outcome combination major clinically relevant non-major bleeding . The efficacy outcome composite symptomatic recurrent thromboembolism asymptomatic deterioration thrombotic burden repeat image . All suspect recurrent thromboembolism , asymptomatic deterioration thrombotic burden repeat imaging , death , well episode bleed evaluated CIAC . Adjudication result basis final analysis . For child , visit schedule regular time point ( see Table 1 ) . Enrolled child treat premature discontinuation rivaroxaban least see end study treatment period . During contact , treatment clinical course child evaluate . Children suspect efficacy safety outcomes undergo confirmatory test per standard care . Blood sample PK/PD take define time point ( see Table 2 ) . An Independent Data Monitoring Committee ( DMC ) monitor child 's safety study give recommendation steer committee .</detailed_description>
