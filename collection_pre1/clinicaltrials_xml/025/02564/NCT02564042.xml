One target plaque locate trunk proximal part extremity ( exclude knee , elbow , intertriginous area ) least 3 ( centimetre ) cm Ñ… 3 cm size Screening Baseline severity representative subject 's overall disease . A female subject eligible participate pregnant ( confirm negative urine human chorionic gonadotrophin test ) , lactate , least one follow condition applies : Nonreproductive potential define : 1 ) Premenopausal females one following procedure document : tubal ligation ; hysteroscopic tubal occlusion procedure followup confirmation bilateral tubal occlusion ; hysterectomy ; bilateral oophorectomy . 2 ) Postmenopausal define 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea ( questionable case blood sample simultaneous follicle stimulate hormone estradiol level consistent menopause fall central laboratory 's postmenopausal reference range confirmatory ) . Females hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) whose menopausal status doubt require use one highly effective contraception method wish continue HRT study . Otherwise , must discontinue HRT allow confirmation postmenopausal status prior study enrolment ; Reproductive potential agree follow one option list modified list highly effective method avoid pregnancy female reproductive potential 30 day prior first dose study medication ( least five terminal halflives OR continue pharmacologic effect end , whichever long ) last dose study medication completion followup visit . Any sign infection psoriatic lesion . A history ongoing serious illness medical , physical , psychiatric condition ( ) , investigator 's opinion , may interfere subject 's completion study . Known hypersensitivity study treatment excipients , history drug allergy , opinion investigator , contraindicate participation . Current chronic history liver disease , know hepatic biliary abnormality ( exception Gilbert 's syndrome asymptomatic gallstone ) , presence hepatitis B surface antigen , positive hepatitis C antibody test result within 3 month screen . Liver function test : alanine aminotransferase &gt; =2x upper limit normal ( ULN ) ; alkaline phosphatase bilirubin &gt; 1.5xULN ( isolated bilirubin &gt; 1.5xULN acceptable bilirubin fractionate direct bilirubin &lt; 35 % ) . QTc &gt; =450 millisecond ( msec ) QTc &gt; =480 msec subject bundle branch block . NOTES : The QTc QT interval correct heart rate accord Fridericia 's formula ( QTcF ) , machine overread . The QTc base single ECG obtain brief recording period . If QTc outside threshold value , triplicate ECGs may perform QTc value average . Ultraviolet ( UV ) light therapy prolonged exposure natural artificial source UV radiation ( eg , sunlight tan booth ) within 4 week prior baseline visit and/or intention exposure study , think investigator potentially impact subject 's psoriasis . Used follow treatment within indicate washout period baseline visit : 1 ) 12 week 5 halflives ( whichever longer ) biologic agent ( eg , 24 week alefacept , 12 week etanercept , 15 week ustekinumab ) ; 2 ) 12 week oral retinoids ( eg , acitretin isotretinoin ) ; 3 ) 8 week cyclosporin , interferon , methotrexate , systemic immunosuppressive immunomodulating agent , psoralen plus UVA light treatment ; 4 ) 4 week systemic corticosteroid adrenocorticotropic hormone analog ; 5 ) 2 week immunization ; drug know possibly worsen psoriasis , betablockers ( eg , propranolol ) , lithium , iodide , angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitor , indomethacin , unless stable dose &gt; 12 week ; 6 ) 2 week topical treatment : corticosteroid , immunomodulators , anthralin ( dithranol ) , Vitamin D derivative , retinoids , coal tar ( use body ) . Participated clinical study receive investigational product within following time period prior baseline visit : 4 week , 5 halflives , twice duration biological effect investigational product ( whichever longer ) .
