	<brief_summary>Recent research suggest skeletal muscle fibrous connective tissue form body-wide network myofascial chain . A systematic analysis dissection study suggest fascia link least variety muscle myofascial chain ( Wilke et al . 2015 ) . As fascia modify stiffness , strain transmission along meridian supposable ( Norton-Old et al . 2013 ) . Tensile transmission along myofascial chain might contribute proper function movement system . However , despite solid evidence vitro study , scarce data available concern vivo behavior meridian . The present study conduct resolve research deficit elucidate whether stretch low limb muscle increase neck mobility . Healthy subject ( n = 3 x 20 ) participate randomize controlled trial . One group perform three 30 bout static stretch gastrocnemius hamstring respectively . A control group remain inactive time . Participants third group perform 6x30 bout static stretch cervical spine zhe sagittal plane ( flexion ) . Pre post intervention well 5 min intervention , maximal cervical range motion ( ROM ) flexion/extension , lateral flexion rotation assess use ultrasonic movement analysis system .</brief_summary>
