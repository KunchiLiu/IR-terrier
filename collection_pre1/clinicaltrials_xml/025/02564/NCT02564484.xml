	<brief_summary>This observational study design establish induced pluripotent stem cell ( iPSCs ) childhood cancer survivor develop persistent treatment-induced peripheral neuropathy , make human neuron compare sensitivity vincristine potentially neurotoxic drug . Investigators assess effect inherit genome variation treatment-induced peripheral neuropathy persists adult cure childhood cancer . Cells childhood cancer survivor develop drug-induced neuropathy isolate induced become neuron . Cell sensitivity anticancer agent test group compare determine survivor genetic variant correspond identify companion genomic study . This assist determine gene variant increase risk treatment-induced neurotoxicity . The investigator interest detect change phenotype pre-post treatment group ( case , control ) respectively , well compare pre-post treatment phenotypic change two group ( case vs. control ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>iPSC Neurons From Adult Survivors Childhood Cancer Who Have Persistent Vincristine-Induced Neuropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants recruit exist protocol St. Jude ( SJLIFE , NCT00760656 ) . Complete neuropathic evaluation obtain part SJLIFE , information share use SJLPSC study . A one-time blood draw obtain , peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC 's ) isolate eventual creation induce pluripotent stem cell ( iPSC ) differentiate human neuron . These human neuron allow investigator functionally validate interrogate CEP72 genetic variant variant gene associate persistent ( acute ) vincristine neuropathy use `` state art '' cellular model human neuron . Furthermore , create neuron patient extremes ( highly sensitive vincristine-induced neuropathy match control ) allow study difference baseline treatment vincristine . PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : - To establish induced pluripotent stem cell ( iPSCs ) childhood cancer survivor develop persistent treatment-induced peripheral neuropathy , make human neuron assess sensitivity vincristine determine whether neuron patient develop neuropathy sensitive vincristine neurotoxic chemotherapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVE : - To evaluate iPSC neuron make patient persistent treatment-related neuropathy iPSC neuron patient develop neuropathy treatment , phenotypic difference prior exposure vincristine potentially neurotoxic medication .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Neuropathy Patients : Adult survivor childhood ALL Presence neuromotor , neurocortical , neurocerebellar toxicity vincristine treatment ( either acute and/or persistent neuropathy ) At least 50 % persistent vincristine neuropathy case CEP72 promoter variant ( rs924607 ) cod variant CEP72 predict damaging ( CADD score &gt; 9 ) . The balance neuropathy case either variant gene associate vincristine neuropathy identify ongoing genomewide association study ( GWAS ) 1250 St. Jude Life ALL survivor , neuropathy absence know genetic variant alter risk neuropathy . Patient understand nature study provide informed consent Inclusion Criteria Controls : Adult survivor childhood diagnosis ALL Absence persistent neurotoxicity ( grade 0 ) completion standard vincristinecontaining chemotherapy regimen ( may may experience acute neuropathy treatment . Matched specify subject neurotoxicity base age ( within 5 year ) , tumor type , chemotherapy regimen total vincristine dosage , race ethnicity . At least 50 % control CEP72 promoter variant T/T genotype ( rs924607 ) cod variant CEP72 predict damaging ( CADD score &gt; 9 ) . The balance control either variant gene associate vincristine neuropathy identify ongoing GWAS 1250 St. Jude Life ALL survivor , know genetic variant alter risk neuropathy . Patient understand nature study provide informed consent Inclusion Women Minorities : Individuals gender , race ethnic group eligible protocol . Exclusion Criteria Both Cohorts : Treatment severely neurotoxic chemotherapy ( i.e . cisplatin ) prior concomitantly vincristine . Carboplatin therapy allow Presence peripheral neuropathy prior vincristine therapy Poorly control insulindependent diabetes condition likely predispose neurotoxicity</criteria>
