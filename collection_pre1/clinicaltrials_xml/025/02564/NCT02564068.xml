	<brief_summary>In human volunteer intranasal administration oxytocin significantly increase parasympathetic decrease sympathetic cardiac control . OSA prevalent disease high cardiovascular risk factor , yet disease remain poorly treat . This proposal , base current literature new basic science result detailed role oxytocin cardiovascular control , test oxytocin administration improve adverse cardiovascular event recurrent nocturnal apnea patient OSA . This project lay groundwork provide preliminary data obtain NIH fund test important hypothesis thoroughly large clinical trial . This study explore intranasal oxytocin positive cardiovascular benefit patient sleep apnea .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This project test follow hypothesis : To test specific aim examine change heart rate group patient recently diagnose OSA . The following approach take two study cohort list : Cohort A : 10 Subjects 1 . 10 subject recently undergone standard `` sleep-lab '' diagnostic polysomnography ( per standard care medical guideline , research purpose ) diagnose OSA recruit research study assess beneficial effect oxytocin treatment . 2 . For research : These 10 subject undergo another `` sleep-lab '' diagnostic polysomnography identical one standard care diagnose OSA . This polysomnography perform research fund externally investigate group . If subject female child bear potential , birth control method duration study record , urine pregnancy test perform prior PSG . 3 . Within one hour prior research polysomnography subject give oxytocin ( 40 International Units , ( IU ) intranasally . 4 . The following 4 outcome measurement compare two sequential diagnostic polysomnographies ( initial without , second oxytocin ) subject : i. basal heart rate sleep ( primary outcome ) ii . mean change heart rate apneic hypopneic event ( primary outcome ) iii . apnea-hypopnea index ( secondary outcome ) iv . percentage time spend patient oxygen saturation : &gt; 90 % , &gt; 80 % &lt; 90 % , &lt; 80 % ( secondary outcome ) The intranasal oxytocin dose 40 IU . The drug store Investigational Drug Pharmacy accord vendor 's recommendation . Polysomnography ( PSG ) comprehensive record biophysiological change occur sleep . It usually perform night , people sleep , though labs accommodate shift worker people circadian rhythm sleep disorder test time day . The PSG monitor many body function include brain ( EEG ) , eye movement ( EOG ) , muscle activity skeletal muscle activation ( EMG ) heart rhythm ( ECG ) sleep . After identification sleep disorder sleep apnea 1970s , respiratory airflow respiratory effort indicator add , along peripheral pulse oximetry . Cohort B : 10 Subjects Once enrollment Cohort A complete , enrollment Cohort B begin . 1 . 10 Subjects recently undergo either standard `` sleep-lab '' diagnostic polysomnography ( per standard care medical guideline , research purpose ) `` home '' PSG test diagnose OSA recruit research study assess beneficial effect oxytocin treatment . 2 . For research : These 10 subject undergo `` sleep-lab '' diagnostic polysomnography would identical one standard care medical guideline diagnose OSA `` sleep-lab '' . This research polysomnography perform within 4 week OSA diagnosis PSG . This PSG perform research fund externally investigate group . If subject female child bear potential , birth control method duration study record , urine pregnancy test perform prior PSG . 3 . Subjects randomize Investigational Drug Services Pharmacy MFA administer either Oxytocin ( 40 IU ) placebo within one hour prior begin study polysomnography . . Both polysomnography technician , patient , research staff blind randomization . The un-blinded personnel IDS pharmacy staff . 4 . Subjects return within 4 week second research study polysomnography perform sleep-lab . This polysomnography perform research fund externally investigate group . 5 . Subjects administer intervention receive first research PSG study within one hour prior begin second polysomnography . Either Oxytocin ( 40 IU ) placebo . 1 . Both polysomnography technician , patient , research staff blind randomization . The un-blinded personnel IDS pharmacy staff . For example : If study polysomnography 1 subject randomize receive placebo 1 hour prior start polysomnography , study polysomnography 2 subject administer oxytocin ( 40 IU ) 1 hour prior start polysomnography . 6 . The following 4 outcome measurement compare two sequential diagnostic PSGs ( initial standard care without oxytocin , second research oxytocin ) subject : i. basal heart rate sleep ( primary outcome ) ii . mean change heart rate apneic hypopneic event ( primary outcome ) iii . apnea-hypopnea index ( secondary outcome ) iv . percentage time spend patient oxygen saturation : &gt; 90 % , &gt; 80 % &lt; 90 % , &lt; 80 % ( secondary outcome ) The intranasal oxytocin dose 40 IU . The drug store Investigational Drug Pharmacy accord vendor 's recommendation . Polysomnography ( PSG ) comprehensive record biophysiological change occur sleep . It usually perform night , people sleep , though labs accommodate shift worker people circadian rhythm sleep disorder test time day . The PSG monitor many body function include brain ( EEG ) , eye movement ( EOG ) , muscle activity skeletal muscle activation ( EMG ) heart rhythm ( ECG ) sleep . After identification sleep disorder sleep apnea 1970s , respiratory airflow respiratory effort indicator add , along peripheral pulse oximetry .</detailed_description>
