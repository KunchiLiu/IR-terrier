	<brief_title>Evaluating Safety Immune Response Human Parainfluenza Virus Type 3 Ebola Virus Vaccine ( HPIV3-EbovZ GP ) Healthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The ongoing Ebola virus outbreak West Africa highlight need prevention treatment strategy , supportive therapy currently treatment Ebola virus disease . The purpose study evaluate safety , infectivity , immunogenicity two dose HPIV3-EbovZ GP vaccine candidate administer intranasally healthy adult . This study enroll healthy adult low pre-existing serum antibody titer human parainfluenza virus type 3 ( HPIV3 ) . Participants enrol sequentially two cohort . Cohort 1 receive two dose 10^6.0 PFU/mL HPIV3-EbovZ GP , approximately 4-8 week apart . Cohort 2 receive two dose 10^7.0 PFU/mL HPIV3-EbovZ GP , approximately 4-8 week apart . Participants admit inpatient unit 1 2 day receive first dose vaccine . While inpatient unit , participant undergo medical history review , physical examination , nasal wash , blood collection , pregnancy test ( female participant ) , pregnancy prevention counsel . Participants discharge inpatient unit Day 7 possibly later , depend result participant 's lab test . An additional study visit occur Day 14 . On Day 26 , participant readmitted inpatient unit , receive second dose vaccine Day 28 . Participants undergo study procedure occur first inpatient stay , discharge Day 35 .
