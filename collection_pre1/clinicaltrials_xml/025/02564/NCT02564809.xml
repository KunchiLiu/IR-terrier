	<detailed_description>This study look effect FBT cognitive function old adult . Additionally , investigator aim explore whether single bout aerobic exercise prior Fit Brains train would magnify train effect cognitive brain outcome . Objectives : 1 ) To compare effect Fit Brains training ( FBT ) effect single bout aerobic exercise prior FBT ( Ex-FBT ) Balanced And Tone ( BAT ; control ) program cognitive performance older adult ; 2 ) To explore effect FBT Ex-FBT BAT brain structure function ; 3 ) To explore whether intervention effect ( i.e. , FBT Ex-FBT ) moderate cognitive status ( i.e. , MCI ) ; 4 ) To explore whether Ex-FBT additional benefit compare FBT . Research Method : The investigator conduct 8-week proof-of-concept , assessor single-blinded randomized control trial ( RCT ) 75 old adult ( i.e. , 25 experimental group ) . A subset participant perform MRI scan baseline 8-weeks . To reduce bias , assessor blind group allocation participant . Participants randomly assign one three group ( i.e. , FBT , Ex-FBT , SCT ) . Participants FBT group require attend 3 formal training session per week , 8 week , Djavad Mowafaghian Centre Brain Health . Each session 60 minute . Additionally , participant ask complete 3 additional one-hour training session home per week . Thus , participant complete total 48 hour cognitive train 8 week . Participants randomize Ex-FBT require attend 3 formal training session per week , 8 week , Djavad Mowafaghian Centre Brain Health . Each session 1 hour . The participant start train 15-minute walk outside . The 15-minute walk follow 45-minute FBT session ( FBT program ) . Additionally , participant ask complete 3 additional 1-hour training session home ( i.e. , 15-minute walk follow 45-minutes FBT training ) . Thus , participant complete total 48 hour cognitive + walk train 8 week . Participants randomly assign BAT group require attend 3 formal training session per week , 8 week , Djavad Mowafaghian Centre Brain Health Centre Hip Health Mobility . Specifically , participant complete total 8 hour sham cognitive training , 8 hour sham exercise training ( Centre Hip Health Mobility ) 8 hour education 8 week . Thus , participant complete total 24 hour sham train 8 week .</detailed_description>
