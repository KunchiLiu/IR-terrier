	<brief_summary>This project evaluate effect piano train computerized cognitive training cognitive performance healthy old adult compare control . The project intend healthy old adult ( 60-80 year ) little previous musical training ( less three year prior musical training cognitive training currently engage music read musical performance , less 10 hour previous cognitive training ) . Investigators anticipate musical engagement serve enjoyable cognitive intervention old adult . Investigators believe piano training enhance cognitive performance executive function essential maintain independence old adulthood . Learning musical instrument , challenge , improve self-efficacy , mood , qualtiy life . Participants engage piano training demonstrate reduce cortisol level increase immune function response . Investigators predict adult enrol computerized cognitive training demonstrate enhance memory , work memory self-efficacy post-training .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The project purpose scientifically examine benefit piano training compare computer cognitive training treatment control cognitive ( process speed , task-switching , verbal fluency , verbal memory , work memory ) , psychosocial ( mood , self-efficacy , quality life ) , physiological variable ( biomarkers ) healthy old adult participant randomize clinical trial design . Participants : Ninety community dwell old adult recruit community . Criteria enrollment : age 60-80 , native English speaker , currently take medication affect memory performance , pre-existing cognitive impairment neurological disorder , ( indicate Telephone Interview Cognitive Status &gt; 30 ) , moderate severe depression ( indicated Geriatric Depression Scale ) , difficulty hand movement , less three year prior musical training , currently engage music read musical performance , less ten hour prior computer brain training experience . Participants randomly assign one three group stratify intelligence gender : piano instruction , computerized cognitive training treatment control group . Informed write consent obtain accordance Institutional Review Board . Procedure : Participants test three visit : pre-training , immediately post-training , three month follow-up . Those randomized piano train computerized cognitive training complete assign train pre-training post-training visit . Measures music aptitude intelligence administer pre-training visit . These factor influence cognitive performance . Any significant difference baseline three assign group statistically control analysis . Standardized cognitive measure use examine process speed , task-switching , verbal fluency , verbal memory , work memory visit . Psychosocial outcome ( mood , self-efficacy , quality life ) physiological biomarkers also evaluate visit . The goal intervention complete 48 hour group train four month period ( 16 week ) . Sixty participant ( 30 piano training ; 30 auditory computer training ) ask attend three hour train week . Thirty participant serve treatment control group . Piano train consist basic piano technique , dexterity exercise , piano literature , music theory . Participants expect perform major scale , repertoire Alfred All-in-One Method , complete weekly theory assignment . Each class session structure cognitive intervention focus upon review material ( 15-20 min ) , remain portion class focus upon learn new skill concept . Computerized cognitive training involve computerize perceptual practice exercise vary difficulty range basic auditory process speed application memory exercise . Within exercise , stimulus ( i.e. , tone , speech sound , word , sentence ) become less discriminable speed presentation increase ( make exercise difficult ) performance improves . The Brain Fitness train program work memory exercise use . Data source ( ) . Data consist series standardize cognitive , psychosocial , neurophysiological measure administer three time point : pre-training , post-training , three month follow-up . All standardized measure previously use assess efficacy cognitive training approach demonstrate good psychometric property .</detailed_description>
