	<brief_summary>Purpose : The primary hypothesis study combination interval exercise training ( IET ) well motivational accelerometry ( MA ) deliver 5-12 week intervention improve cardiorespiratory fitness patient prepare undergo allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation ( alloHCT ) . MA establish term , respect study , MA refers use wearable accelerometry pair regular interval physical activity coach member study staff IET training . The study also look several secondary endpoint include association intervention change cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A , multiple tumor suppressor 1 ( p16INK4a ) , association intervention change symptoms quality life transplant . Participants : 60 patient randomize two group , 30 intervention group consist IET MA , 30 control group apply usual care use wearable accelerometry without motivational physical activity coaching . Procedures ( method ) : Results study inform randomize , multi-site study pre-transplant exercise intervention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator team current protocol recently complete single-arm pilot protocol ( LCCC 1311 ) 6-week home-based unsupervised IET program ( goal three IET session per week , 65 % -95 % Max Heart Rate [ MHR ] ) patient plan undergo alloHCT . In study , participant prepare undergo alloHCT experience average 3.8ml/kg*min improvement peak volume oxygen consume ( VO2peak ) pre post-intervention . Patients LCCC 1311 wore FitBit accelerometer throughout study period . The primary purpose current randomize controlled trial determine , patient prepare undergo alloHCT , whether intervention comprise interval exercise training motivational accelerometry ( IET/MA ) improve cardiorespiratory fitness control group receive usual care accelerometer without motivational physical activity coaching . The study also look several secondary endpoint include association intervention change p16INK4a , association intervention change symptoms quality life transplant . This randomize controlled trial include 60 patient prepare undergo alloHCT ( 30 intervention group , 30 control group ) . We plan analyze effect IET/MA VO2peak . Subjects recruit transplant team determine undergo alloHCT within subsequent 5-12 week . Following recruitment , patient undergo baseline fitness assessment consist cardiorespiratory exercise test use indirect calorimetry cycle ergometry ( assessment VO2peak ) , 6 minute walk distance testing , baseline physical activity , symptom quality life questionnaire . Participants randomize IET/MA group receive individualize IET/MA prescription duration least 5 week , time admission alloHCT 12 week initiation IET/MA , whichever occur first . The mode exercise walking , jogging , run , cycling , elliptical , stair climbing , combination , perform unsupervised home . For first week , participant ask engage 30 minute aerobic exercise intensity 3-4 day . For week two beyond , participant undergo 3-4 session IET , consist 5 minute warm-up five 2-minute interval , goal reach 80 % MHR , separate 3 minute recovery/light activity interval . Each exercise session total 30 minute . Fitness assessment complete end intervention period , time admission alloHCT . Based improvement VO2peak see pre-alloHCT patient population LCCC 1311 , current study power detect 3.8ml/kg*min VO2peak improvement intervention group relative control group . All participant group provide FitBit Surge accelerometer . Participants intervention group also receive weekly motivation study team member achieve 10 % week week improvement average steps/day . Participants control group receive physical activity coaching . Participants continue wear accelerometer intervention 1 year follow alloHCT . Participants group blood draw p16INK4a level IET intervention . Participants group also complete symptom quality life questionnaires intervention periodically throughout year follow alloHCT ( please see study plan time event table ) .</detailed_description>
