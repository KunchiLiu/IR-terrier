	<brief_title>Efficacy Labor Epidurals Postpartum Tubal Ligation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim research determine effect postpartum epidural saline infusion reactivation labor epidural catheter use anesthetic technique PPTL follow vaginal delivery . It propose continuous epidural saline infusion decrease incidence catheter obstruction prevent clot , fibrosis , tissue plug therefore improve reactivation rate . To knowledge , novel method attempt improve epidural reactivation rate successful , would challenge current practice cap epidural follow delivery later attempt reactivation prior PPTL . This may , possibly , become new technique use improve rate epidural reactivation PPTL . If study result show improved labor epidural reactivation rate , benefit would include decreased patient morbidity great patient comfort satisfaction avoid risk additional neuraxial procedure well general anesthesia . These risk include difficult failed intubation , aspiration , hypotension , headache , postoperative nausea vomiting , sore throat . Improving epidural reactivation rate could also result great OR efficiency decrease cost patient hospital . The investigator also hope elucidate factor associate catheter migration dislodgement subsequent failure epidural reactivation . Additionally , hope determine effect obesity length time prior epidural reactivation epidural reactivation rate .</detailed_description>
