	<brief_title>Indocyanine Green Versus Blue Dye Detection Sentinel Lymph Node In Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In past year , Sentinel Lymph Node ( SLN ) procedure emerge interesting solution debate lymphadenectomy endometrial cancer . Using blue-dye inexpensive result unsatisfactory detection rate SLN . IndoCyanine Green ( ICG ) near-infrared image novel technology SLN map initial report use ICG show high detection rate . In present study , aim determine precisely increase detection rate SLN associate use ICG instead blue dye . This randomize controlled trial include patient preoperative stage I endometrial carcinoma . All include woman undergo SLN mapping blue dye one hemipelvis ICG hemipelvis . Randomization concern side hemipelvis blue dye v ICG mapping use , patient 's contralateral hemipelvis serve control ipsilateral hemipelvis . The primary endpoint difference proportion hemipelves successful detection SLN accord dye use . The unique precise information gain present study contribute determine whether benefit use ICG blue dye sufficient justify expense use .</detailed_description>
