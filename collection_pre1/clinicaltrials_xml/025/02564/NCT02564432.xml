	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate clinical implementation new percutaneous prosthetic attachment system determine resident microbial ecology implant exit site simultaneously study systemic local stomal immune response . This study follow 10 patient implant percutaneous osseointegrated prosthetics ( POPs ) period one year . Two state-of-the-art , pre- post-surgery bacterial monitoring technology use ; procedure intend facilitate early prediction , detection , treatment infection , well provide follow-up data potentially use advantageously manipulate stomal microbial environment future clinical trial . Commensal skin bacteria colonize stoma . Colonization necessarily result infection . Over time , presence skin penetrate foreign object ( implant ) cause measurable change bacterial population ( microbiota ) around POP exit site . It anticipate evolve microbiota , concert measurable change local systemic cytokine response , reveal pattern associate mutualistic-commensal bacteria and/or pathogenic bacteria relate stage chronic wound heal . These pattern could use determine presence stable uninfected stoma progression stomal infection . Hopefully , information allow timely intervention prevent infection , i.e . detect early stage infection discern common pattern stable mutualistic-commensal bacterial strain , effective intervention protocol ( antibiotic , probiotic manipulation stomal skin microbiota ) may develop avoid patient morbidity assure implant survival .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Percutaneous osseointegrated prosthetic ( POP ) attachment ( i.e. , direct skeletal attachment artificial limb ) rapidly evolve technology . This follow decade successful European trial largely involved transfemoral amputee . This information together translational animal study make possible commence Early Feasibility Device Exemption ( IDE ) Pilot Program direction FDA . Ten transfemoral amputee , select Veteran active military population receive novel POP device . The objective study follow 10 patient implanted POP period one year . All stomas colonize local skin bacteria ; colonization necessarily result infection . Over time , presence skin penetrate foreign object ( implant ) cause measurable change bacterial population ( microbiota ) around PODS exit site . It anticipate evolve microbiota , concert measurable change local systemic cytokine response , reveal pattern associate mutualistic-commensal bacteria and/or pathogenic bacteria relate stage chronic wound heal . These pattern could use determine presence stable uninfected stoma progression stomal infection . Hopefully , information allow timely intervention prevent infection , i.e . detect early stage infection discern common pattern stable mutualistic-commensal bacterial strain , effective intervention protocol ( antibiotic , probiotic manipulation stomal skin microbiota ) may develop avoid patient morbidity assure implant survival . The study aim test following : Aim 1 : Determine characterize microbiota region surround skin/implant interface . Sampling take place stage wound heal stomal maturation begin Stage 1 Stage 2 surgery , well defined time point , collection site ( i.e. , stoma , ipsilateral contralateral thigh skin ) one year post surgery . This carried-out use specific swab technique collect bacterial fungal DNA amplify sequence bacterial 16S rRNA fungal 18S rRNA gene . AIM 2 : Compare expression pattern local systemic inflammatory biomarkers time determine correlation microbiota pattern diagnose state wind heal skin/implant interface systemic response potentially life-long chronic wound . The measurement pro-inflammatory cytokine , find stomal exudate ( local biomarkers ) blood serum ( systemic biomarkers ) , along evolve microbiota profile ( Aim # 1 ) help well characterize homeostatic state stoma subsequent optimum wound care therapy . The ability predict infection avoid without use antibiotic would great value future clinical trial . Assuming success feasibility pilot trial , anticipate trial expand include 200 patient .</detailed_description>
