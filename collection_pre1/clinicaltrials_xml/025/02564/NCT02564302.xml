	<detailed_description>Background : Atrial fibrillation common arrhythmic disorder ablation AF become important part AF treatment . AF associate large number somatic symptom like chest pain , fatigue , lightheadedness , palpitation , physical limitation , shortness breath , irregular rhythm heart rate also psychological comorbidities anxiety depression [ 1 ] . In recent year , severity comorbidities become apparent AF patient . For instance , Sears colleague find positive correlation number AF symptom report number negative emotion experience [ 2 ] . Since prospective data effect AF ablation long term mortality morbidity , reduction AF relate symptom improvement quality life ( QoL ) still major goal AF ablation [ 3,4 ] . Mindful meditation ( MM ) basic form meditation involve focus one thing internally externally . Being fully present moment goal MM . Practicing MM teach relaxation concentration experience bodily sensation breathe pattern . Mindfulness independent environmental stimulus ; state mind achieve time [ 5 ] . Studies show , practice , form meditation provide long- short-term positive effect respect reduction anxiety depression [ 6,7 ] . Immediate transferable benefit AF patient include self-regulated attention , heighten perception internal state , reduce stress anxiety symptom , increase overall well-being . Mindfulness train heighten meta-cognitive processing , improve person 's ability control adverse thought feeling . Consistent mindful meditation training induce neuroplasticity [ 7,8 ] . The amygdala crucial brain structure hyperactive perceive stressful condition [ 8 ] . Being able utilize skill control emotion stressful situation beneficial control psychological hyperactivity . Studies show mindful-attention training decrease amygdala activity even non-meditative state [ 6 ] . This proof skill obtain meditation last positive neural effect . In another study , Holzel et al . find eight week MM training , significant correlation decrease subjective stress decrease amygdala 's gray matter density . Therefore , reduction stress output positively correlate gray matter density . MM training induces brain change amygdala rest state connectivity , impact cognition increase attentional control executive function [ 9 ] . Neurofeedback training ( NFT ) method participant hook EEG allow participant see active brain monitor neural change real-time . NFT proven significantly enhance positive effect MM train positive effect depression [ 10,11 ] . The present study go investigate psychological physiological benefit mindful meditation ( MM ) training patient atrial fibrillation ( AF ) use system real-time-neurofeedback . Rationale study design : Although grow evidence might also positive prognostic effect especially stroke risk [ 12,13 ] treatment AF relate symptom still one major target AF ablation . Lakkireddy colleague show yoga could improve symptom QoL well anxiety depression score [ 14 ] AF patient , illustrate alternative therapy highly effective AF valuable addition somatic therapy like AF-ablation . In study investigator want investigate effect mindfulness meditation support MUSE™ headband device provide neurofeedback meditation . This way investigator seek improve effect meditation also able monitor therapy compliance via implement software . Since patient AF heterogeneous group AF burden , comorbidities well symptom perception differ significantly investigator choose investigate less diverse group patient symptomatic AF schedule AF ablation . By apply prospective randomization investigator avoid risk significant bias baseline patient characteristic comorbidities . Study design aim : A total number 60 patient wait AF ablation symptomatic AF include prospective , randomize pilot study . All patient undergo assessment QoL , anxiety depression use 3 self-reporting scale QoL , anxiety depression baseline 12 week . The scale list Appendix A . At baseline patient 1:1 randomize either part intervention ( Group 1 ) control ( Group 2 ) group . Patients Group 1 supply MUSE™ headband ( InteraXon Inc. , Toronto , Canada ) tool mindfulness meditation neurofeedback . Patients Group 2 undergo study-related treatment . The aim study investigate effect mindfulness meditation neurofeedback QoL , anxiety depression patient await AF ablation . The result study also basis future study investigate Statistical analysis : The primary endpoint express mean median test result applicable . The secondary endpoint measure individual duration use device group 1 . The Shapiro-Wilks-test use test normality distribution Mann-Whitney-U test apply comparison mean . Study-timeline Budget : Our institution high volume centre AF ablation perform 300-350 procedure per year . Because non-invasive character MUSE-device investigator expect high recruitment rate plan complete enrollment 60 patient within 6 month . With follow-time 3 month investigator expect complete patient inclusion follow-up 9 month . Data analysis take approximately 4 week result total study duration 10 month . InteraXon Inc. provide 30 MUSE™ headband study time .</detailed_description>
