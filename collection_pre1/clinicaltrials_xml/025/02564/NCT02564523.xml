	<detailed_description>This randomize , observer-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel-group , multicenter , Phase 2 study evaluate safety , tolerability immunogenicity 3 heterologous prime-boost regimen use Ad26.ZEBOV prime MVA-BN-Filo boost vaccination , administer 28- , 56- 84-day ( Group 1 , 2 3 ) interval , healthy elderly participant . A 28- 56-day ( Groups 1 2 , ) schedule evaluate HIV-infected participant child . The study consist screen phase 8 week , vaccination phase participant vaccinate baseline ( Day 1 ) follow boost vaccination Day 29 , 57 85 , post-vaccination phase long-term follow-up phase Day 365 . All participant within cohort follow blinded manner site last subject cohort complete study . This study conduct Africa enrollment take place sequentially four cohort : first cohort consist healthy participant ( 18 - 70 year ) ; second cohort ( 2a ) include HIV-infected participant ( 18 50 year ) healthy child 12 17 year ( cohort 2b ) ; third cohort include child age 4 11 year inclusive fourth cohort young child age 1 3 year enrol . Within cohort , participant randomize 5:1 ratio receive active vaccine versus placebo . Safety evaluation include assessment adverse event , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) adult participant screen , physical examination , vital sign ( blood pressure , pulse/heart rate , body temperature ) , clinical laboratory pregnancy test . An independent data monitoring committee ( IDMC ) establish monitor data regular basis ensure continue safety participant enrol study .</detailed_description>
