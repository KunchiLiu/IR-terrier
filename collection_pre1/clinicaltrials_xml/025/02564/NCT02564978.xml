	<brief_summary>Background : Age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) main reason old people lose vision . It affect macula , center retina need sharp , clear vision . Researchers want see antibiotic help people advanced form AMD , Geographic Atrophy ( GA ) . Objective : To see minocycline safe people GA help preserve vision . Eligibility : People age 55 old GA least one eye . Design : Participants screen physical exam , medical history , blood test , eye exam . Participants assign take either minocycline placebo . They take 1 pill twice day least 3 year . Participants study visit every 6 month least 3 year . At visit , participant medical history . They may : Blood test . Eye exam . Vision , eye pressure , eye movement check . The pupil may dilate . The inside eye may photograph . Their thyroid gland felt swallow . Microperimetry . They sit front computer press button see light screen . Fluorescein angiography . An intravenous line ( IV ) place arm vein . A dye call fluorescein place IV travel vein blood vessel eye . A camera take picture dye flow eye blood vessel . Participants contact phone periodically visit . They answer question visual function every year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Oral Minocycline Treatment Geographic Atrophy Associated With Age-Related Macular Degeneration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : Age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) , lead cause blindness people age 65 United States , heterogeneous clinical entity retinal degeneration occur predominantly macula context age lead impairment central visual acuity ( VA ) . AMD occur two general form , one involve choroidal neovascularization ( CNV ) subsequent formation disciform scar . This often referred neovascular wet form . A second form , subject study , term dry /atrophic macular degeneration otherwise geographic atrophy ( GA ) involve slow progressive atrophy retinal pigment epithelial ( RPE ) cell photoreceptors macula , also result central vision loss . GA estimate affect 1 million person U.S. current treatment prevent onset retard progression . While etiology GA completely understand , inflammatory process involve activation resident immune cell retina call microglia likely contribute . Minocycline inhibit activation microglia produce inflammatory factor implicate GA development . The objective study investigate safety possible efficacy oral minocycline patient GA. Study Population : Forty participant unilateral bilateral GA associate AMD enrol . Design : This multi-center , prospective , single-arm , Phase II study evaluate minocycline potential treatment decrease rate worsen GA associate AMD . Participants assignedundergo nine month run-in phase prior receive investigational product ( IP ) . During run-in phase , participant total four pre-treatment visit . Following run-in phase , begin Month 9 , participant receive oral dose 100 mg minocycline twice daily 36 month . There common termination date , take place last recruited participant receive 36 month treatment . Participants recruit earlier part study continue treatment follow every six month common termination date . Outcome Measures : The primary outcome rate change area GA base grade external Reading Center fundus autofluorescence ( FAF ) image assign study eye . The primary outcome compare rate GA area expansion determine FAF image follow initiation IP 24 month treatment . Secondary outcome compare difference rate change best-corrected visual acuity ( BCVA ) , low-luminance VA , area GA base fundus photography , macular sensitivity measure use microperimetry run-in treatment phase . Safety outcomes include number severity adverse event ( AEs ) . Ocular safety outcome indicate change VA , ocular surface change , intraocular inflammation ocular change consistent natural progression GA .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : To eligible , follow inclusion criterion must meet , applicable : Participant must 55 year age old . Participant ( legal guardian ) must understand sign protocol inform consent document . Participant must evidence early intermediate AMD define characteristic presence drusen and/or pigmentary change . Participant must able swallow capsule . Participant must normal renal function liver function mild abnormality grade 1 defined Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events v4.0 ( CTCAE ) . Participant must agree minimize exposure sunlight artificial ultraviolet ( UV ) ray wear protective clothing , sunglasses sunscreen ( minimum sun protection factor ( SPF ) 15 ) s/he must sun . Any female participant childbearing potential ( see Appendix 1 definition ) must negative pregnancy test screen willing undergo pregnancy test throughout study . Any female participant childbearing potential ( see Appendix 1 definition ) male participant able father child must ( partner ) hysterectomy vasectomy , completely abstinent* intercourse must agree practice two acceptable method contraception throughout course study least one week investigational product ( IP ) discontinuation . Acceptable method contraception include : 1. hormonal contraception ( i.e. , birth control pill , inject hormone , dermal patch vaginal ring ) , 2. intrauterine device , 3. barrier method ( diaphragm , condom ) spermicide , , 4. surgical sterilization ( hysterectomy tubal ligation ) . Abstinence acceptable participant prefer usual lifestyle choice . Periodic abstinence ( e.g. , calendar , ovulation , symptothermal , postovulation method ) withdrawal acceptable method contraception . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : A participant eligible follow exclusion criterion present . Participant actively receive study therapy another investigational study . Any female participant childbearing potential ( see Appendix 1 definition ) pregnant , breastfeed plan become pregnant study . Participant expect unable comply study procedure followup visit . Participant ocular systemic medication know toxic lens , retina optic nerve ( e.g. , ethambutol , chloroquine , hydroxychloroquine ) . Participant condition would preclude participation study ( e.g. , unstable medical status include blood pressure glycemic control ) interfere participant ability engage require protocol evaluation test and/or comply study visit . Participant history chronic renal failure require dialysis kidney transplant . Participant history chronic hepatitis liver failure . Participant history thyroid cancer . Participant allergy hypersensitivity minocycline drug tetracycline family . Participant currently take minocycline another tetracycline medication . Participant take medication could adversely interact minocycline methoxyflurane . Participant prior history idiopathic intracranial hypertension . STUDY EYE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA : The participant must least one eye meeting inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion list . STUDY EYE INCLUSION CRITERIA : The study eye must least ( Omega ) disc area ( approximately 1 mm ( 2 ) ) GA compatible dry AMD . GA define one welldefined often circular patch partial complete depigmentation RPE , typically exposure underlie choroidal blood vessel . Even much RPE appear preserve large choroidal vessel visible , round patch RPE partial depigmentation may classify early GA . The GA study eye must able photographed entirety , must contiguous area peripapillary atrophy , complicate area measurement . The total area GA lesion combine less 7.0 MPS disc area ( DA ) ( 17.78 mm ( 2 ) ) evident FAF imaging . The VA study eye &gt; 19 EETDRS letter ( i.e. , 20/400 good ) . The study eye must clarity ocular medium degree pupil dilation sufficient permit adequate fundus photograph . STUDY EYE EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Current evidence choroidal neovascularization ( CNV ) determine treat physician history treatment CNV Evidence retinal atrophy due cause atrophic AMD . Current evidence history ocular disorder study eye opinion investigator confounds study outcome measure , include ( limited ) : 1. nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy involve 10 hemorrhage microaneurysms , active proliferative diabetic retinopathy 2 . Branch central retinal vein artery occlusion 3 . Macular hole 4 . Pathologic myopia 5 . Uveitis 6 . Pseudovitelliform maculopathy History vitreoretinal surgery . Need ocular surgery course study . Recent history lens removal ( &lt; 3 month ) Yttrium Aluminum Garnet ( YAG ) laser capsulotomy ( &lt; 1 month ) .</criteria>
