	<brief_summary>For first 28 day cycle , patient treat single agent pacritinib 200 mg twice daily . The investigator choose start dose base previous three phase I study pacritinib single agent show maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) 500 mg , subsequently , dose 400 mg daily recommend phase II study . Recently , result phase III PERSIST-1 trial compare pacritinib best available therapy ( BAT ) patient MF report 2015 American Society Clinical Oncology ( ASCO ) annual meeting . Pacritinib find significantly effective BAT reduce spleen volume 24 week therapy improve constitutional symptom . Low dose decitabine demonstrate depletion DNMT1 normal hematopoietic stem cell ( HSC ) without cytotoxicity subcutaneous ( SC ) instead intravenous ( IV ) administration may avoid high peak level cause apoptosis . Furthermore , low toxicity associate low dose decitabine would allow frequent ( 1 3 time weekly ) administration drug would catch cell S-phase via great exposure time . Based finding , start dose decitabine 5 mg/m2 SC twice weekly well tolerated effective patient MF MPN/MDS syndrome combine pacritinib 400 mg daily .</brief_summary>
