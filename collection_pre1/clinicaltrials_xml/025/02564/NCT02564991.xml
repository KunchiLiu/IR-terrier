	<brief_summary>Background : The way alcohol affect brain structure widely study . But way affect part brain still unknown . Researchers want use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan study brain structure function . They hope help good understand change happen brain region treatment alcohol use disorder . Objectives : To study change brain use MRI people without alcohol use disorder . To study brain change affect gait , balance , cognitive ability , behavior . To see brain recovers alcohol use stop . Eligibility : People alcohol dependence currently hospitalize particular unit NIH . Healthy volunteer 30 60 year old without alcohol use disorder . Design : Participants screen separate protocol . Participants give urine sample drug test pregnancy test study visit . They also pass breath alcohol test . At first visit , participant MRI . The scanner metal cylinder strong magnetic field . Participants lie table slide cylinder . They behavior memory task outside scanner . They gait balance test . They stand leg , stand one leg , walk straight line . They perform task eye open , eye close . They test memory , thinking , problem solving . Some participant second visit . They another MRI repeat behavior memory task .</brief_summary>

This study also investigate cerebrocerebellar circuit contribute cognitive motor impairment alcoholism . Study Population Healthy volunteer Inpatient participant alcohol use disorder . Design Participants receive whole-brain structural image assessment cerebellar function time admission time discharge . Outcome The Primary outcome study assess recovery cerebellar structure function end treatment compare treatment entry measure .</detailed_description>
