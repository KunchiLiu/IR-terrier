	<brief_summary>This study evaluate efficacy safety two concentration ( 0.5 percent [ % ] 1 % ) two application frequency ( day twice day ) GSK2894512 cream topical treatment adolescent adult subject atopic dermatitis . Results study consider select appropriate concentration GSK2894512 cream application frequency future clinical study . This multicenter ( United States , Canada , Japan ) , randomize , double-blind ( sponsor-unblind ) , vehicle-controlled , 6-arm , parallel-group , dose-finding study adolescent adult subject atopic dermatitis . Two concentration GSK2894512 cream ( 0.5 % 1 % ) vehicle control cream equally randomize evaluate follow application atopic dermatitis lesion ( except scalp ) daily ( even ) twice daily ( morning evening ) 12 week . This study consist 3 period : 4 week screen , 12 week double-blind treatment , 4 week post-treatment follow-up . The total duration subject participation approximately 16 20 week . Approximately 270 adolescent adult male females subject atopic dermatitis screen order least 228 randomized subject ( 38 subject 6 treatment group ) approximately 204 evaluable subject overall . Approximately 30 subject randomize Japan achieve least 24 evaluable Japanese subject .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male female 12 65 year age inclusive , time signing informed consent Diagnosis atopic dermatitis accord Hanifin Rajka criterion active inflammation . Body surface area involvement &gt; =5 % &lt; =35 % , exclude scalp , Screening Baseline . An IGA atopic dermatitis score &gt; =3 Baseline . At least one target lesion measure least 3 centimetre ( cm ) Ñ… 3 cm size Screening Baseline must representative subject 's disease state , locate hand , foot , genitalia . A female subject eligible participate pregnant ( confirm negative urine human chorionic gonadotrophin test ) , lactate , least one follow condition applies : Nonreproductive potential define : 1 ) Premenopausal females one following procedure document : tubal ligation ; hysteroscopic tubal occlusion procedure followup confirmation bilateral tubal occlusion ; hysterectomy ; bilateral oophorectomy . 2 ) Postmenopausal define 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea ( questionable case blood sample simultaneous follicle stimulate hormone estradiol level consistent menopause fall central laboratory 's postmenopausal reference range confirmatory ) . Females hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) whose menopausal status doubt require use one highly effective contraception method wish continue HRT study . Otherwise , must discontinue HRT allow confirmation postmenopausal status prior study enrolment ; Reproductive potential agree follow one option list modified list highly effective method avoid pregnancy female reproductive potential 30 day prior first dose study medication last dose study medication completion followup visit . Unstable course atopic dermatitis ( spontaneously improve rapidly deteriorate ) determine investigator previous 4 week prior Baseline . Concurrent condition history disease : 1 ) Immunocompromized ( eg , lymphoma , acquire immunodeficiency syndrome , WiskottAldrich Syndrome ) history malignant disease within 5 year baseline visit ; 2 ) Chronic acute infection require treatment systemic antibiotic , antiviral , antiparasitics , antiprotozoal , antifungal within 4 week baseline visit ; 3 ) Active acute bacterial , fungal , viral ( eg , herpes simplex , herpes zoster , chicken pox ) skin infection within 1 week baseline visit ; 4 ) Any concomitant skin disorder ( eg , generalized erythroderma Netherton 's Syndrome , psoriasis ) ; pigmentation , extensive scar opinion investigator may interfere evaluation AD lesion compromise subject safety ; 5 ) Presence AD lesion hand foot without prior history involvement classical area involvement face fold ; 6 ) Other type eczema . A history ongoing serious illness medical , physical , psychiatric condition ( ) , investigator 's opinion , may interfere subject 's completion study . Known hypersensitivity study treatment excipients . Current chronic history liver disease , know hepatic biliary abnormality ( exception Gilbert 's syndrome asymptomatic gallstone ) , presence hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) , positive hepatitis C antibody test result within 3 month screen . Liver function test : alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) &gt; =2x upper limit normal ( ULN ) ; alkaline phosphatase bilirubin &gt; 1.5xULN ( isolated bilirubin &gt; 1.5xULN acceptable bilirubin fractionate direct bilirubin &lt; 35 % ) . QTc &gt; =450 millisecond ( msec ) QTc &gt; =480 msec subject bundle branch block . NOTES : The QTc QT interval correct heart rate accord Fridericia 's formula ( QTcF ) , machine overread . The QTc base single ECG obtain brief recording period . If QTc outside threshold value , triplicate ECGs may perform QTc value average . Ultraviolet ( UV ) light therapy prolonged exposure natural artificial source UV radiation ( eg , sunlight tan booth ) within 4 week prior baseline visit and/or intention exposure study , think investigator potentially impact subject 's atopic dermatitis . Used follow treatment within indicate washout period baseline visit : 12 week 5 halflives ( whichever longer ) biologic agent ( eg , 18 week omalizumab ) ; 8 week cyclosporin , methotrexate , azathioprine , systemic immunosuppressive immunomodulating agent ( eg , mycophenolate tacrolimus ) ; 4 week systemic corticosteroid adrenocorticotropic hormone analog ; 2 week topical treatment : corticosteroid , calcineurin inhibitor , coal tar ( body ) ; 2 week immunization ; sedate antihistamine ( non sedate antihistamine permit ) ; 1 week topical antibiotic , antibacterial cleanse body wash/soap dilute sodium hypochlorite `` bleach '' bath . Participated clinical study receive investigational product within following time period prior baseline visit : 4 week , 5 halflives , twice duration biological effect investigational product ( whichever longer ) . History alcohol substance abuse within last 2 year . Participated previous study use GSK2894512 ( WBI1001 ) .</criteria>
