	<brief_summary>Relapse serious quit attempt occur 70-90 % smoker try quit smoking . This study utilize sequential , multiple assignment , randomize trial ( SMART ) design - - innovative multi-phase approach - - test post-relapse treatment design assist smoker make new , successful quit attempt . This study test Relapse Recovery ( RR ) treatment apply two stage follow relapse : 1 ) RR Preparation Phase treatments smoker relapse initial quit attempt , 2 ) RR Cessation Phase treatment relapse smoker decide make new quit attempt . Smokers motivate quit smoke make initial quit attempt Quit Phase ( cessation medication + counseling ) . Participants relapse randomize one three RR Preparation Phase treatment ( Behavioral [ Smoking ] Reduction Counseling + Nicotine Mini-Lozenge ; Recycling Counseling encourage participant quit soon possible ; Preparation Phase Control ) . RR Preparation Phase participant ( control ) elect try new quit attempt randomize one four RR Cessation Phase treatment base 2X2 fully-crossed factorial design test two factor : Supportive Counseling ( vs. Brief Information ) Skill Training ( vs. Brief Information ) . All RR Cessation Phase participant receive 8 week combination nicotine replacement therapy ( nicotine patch + nicotine mini-lozenge ) .

	<detailed_description>This study aim identify effective Relapse Recovery ( RR ) treatment assist smoker relapse initial quit attempt . The study use sequential , multiple assignment , randomize trial ( SMART ) design three phase . In SMART design , randomization occur one stage , randomization later stage base response treatment earlier stage . The three phase SMART study follow : 1 . Phase 1 consists Quit Phase participant ( smoker motivate quit smoke ) offer evidence-based cessation treatment ( cessation medication plus counseling ) . Participants relapse eligible proceed next phase involve Relapse Recovery ( RR ) Preparation treatment . 2 .

Smoking status assess 14 month randomization RR Preparation Phase treatment . The investigator hypothesize 7-day point point-prevalence abstinence rate 15 % Preparation Phase Control condition , 25 % Recycling condition , 35 % Behavioral Reduction condition . The investigator propose increase abstinence 15 % high would clinically significant . The investigator power study demonstrate significant difference two active RR Preparation Phase treatment . Therefore , investigator anticipate RR Behavioral Reduction treatment significantly increase long-term abstinence rate ( primary outcome : Biochemically-confirmed 7-Day Point Prevalence Abstinence 14 Months post-randomization Phase 2 Preparation treatment ) produce Preparation Phase Control condition . Because limitation statistical power , analyse RR Cessation Phase treatment exploratory ( secondary outcome : Self-Reported 7-Day Point Prevalence Abstinence 26 Weeks post-randomization Phase 3 Cessation treatment ) .</detailed_description>
