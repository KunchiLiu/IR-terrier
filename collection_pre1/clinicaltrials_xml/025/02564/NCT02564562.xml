	<brief_title>A Study To Investigate The Absorption , Distribution , Metabolism , And Excretion Of 14cPF-06463922 In Healthy Male Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Healthy male subject , time screening , age 18 55 year , inclusive . Healthy define clinically relevant abnormality identify detailed medical history , full physical examination , include blood pressure pulse rate measurement , 12lead ECG clinical laboratory test . Body Mass Index ( BMI ) 17.5 30.5 kg/m2 total body weight &gt; 50 kg ( 110 lb ) Evidence personally sign date informed consent document indicate subject inform pertinent aspect study . Subjects willing able comply schedule visit , treatment plan , laboratory test , study procedure . Evidence history clinically significant hematological , renal , endocrine , pulmonary , gastrointestinal , cardiovascular , hepatic , psychiatric , neurologic , allergic disease ( include drug allergy , exclude untreated , asymptomatic , seasonal allergy time dose ) . Any condition possibly affect drug absorption ( eg , gastrectomy ) . A positive urine drug screen . History regular alcohol consumption exceed 7 drinks/week ( 1 drink = 5 ounce [ 150 mL ] wine 12 ounce [ 360 mL ] beer 1.5 ounce [ 45 mL ] hard liquor ) within 6 month Screening . Treatment investigational drug within 30 day ( determined local requirement ) 5 halflives precede first dose study medication ( whichever longer ) . Screening supine blood pressure 140 mm Hg ( systolic ) 90 mm Hg ( diastolic ) , follow least 5 minute supine rest . If blood pressure 140 mm Hg ( systolic ) 90 mm Hg ( diastolic ) , blood pressure repeat two time average three blood pressure value use determine subject 's eligibility . Screening supine 12lead ECG demonstrate QTcF ( time ECG Q wave end T wave correspond electrical systole [ QT ] correct heart rate use Fredericia 's formula ) &gt; 450 msec QRS interval ( time ECG Q wave end S wave correspond ventricle depolarization ) &gt; 120 msec . If QTcF exceed 450 msec , QRS exceed 120 msec , ECG repeat two time average three QTcF QRS value use determine subject 's eligibility . Subjects ANY follow abnormality clinical laboratory test screen , assess study specific laboratory confirm single repeat , deem necessary : Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) /serum glutamic oxaloacetic transminase ( SGOT ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) /serum glutamic pyruvic transminase ( SGPT ) 3 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) ; Total bilirubin ≥ 1.5x ULN ; subject history Gilbert 's syndrome may direct bilirubin measure would eligible study provide direct bilirubin ≤ ULN . Use prescription nonprescription drug dietary supplement within 7 day 5 half life ( whichever longer ) prior first dose study medication . As exception , acetaminophen/paracetamol may use dos 1 g/day . Limited use nonprescription medication believe affect subject safety overall result study may permit casebycase basis follow approval sponsor . Herbal supplement hormone replacement therapy must discontinue least 28 day prior first dose study medication . Blood donation ( exclude plasma donation ) approximately 1 pint ( 500 mL ) within 56 day prior dose . History sensitivity heparin heparininduced thrombocytopenia . Unwilling unable comply Lifestyle guideline describe protocol . Subjects investigational site staff member directly involved conduct study family member , site staff member otherwise supervised investigator , subject Pfizer employee directly involve conduct study . Other severe acute chronic medical psychiatric condition laboratory abnormality may increase risk associate study participation investigational product administration may interfere interpretation study result , judgment investigator , would make subject inappropriate entry study . Subjects history irregular bowel movement eg , regular episode diarrhea constipation , irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) lactose intolerance . Subjects enrol previous radionucleotide study receive radiotherapy within 12 month prior screen total radioactivity would exceed acceptable dosimetry ( ie , occupational exposure 5 rem per year ) . Subjects whose occupation require exposure radiation monitoring radiation exposure . Subjects use tobacco within 90 day prior dose . Male subject partner currently pregnant ; male subject able father child unwilling unable use 2 highly effective method contraception outline protocol duration study least 90 day last dose investigational product longer base upon compound 's half life characteristic .</criteria>
