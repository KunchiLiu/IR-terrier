	<detailed_description>The rapid rate childhood mental health behavioral ( MHB ) disorder identify primary care practice represent public health crisis demand critical examination . Approximately 20 % child adolescent suffer MHB disorder year . The commonly recognize childhood MHB disorder attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) .

In order improve detection ADHD co-morbidities prevent undue polypharmacy , validate screening tool essential primary care set . However , general pediatric practice fast paced high volume . Clearly , ideal diagnostic evaluation child symptoms inattention would involve concurrent administration validate screening tool ADHD anxiety , despite constraint busy pediatric practice . The investigator believe health information technology combine ongoing quality improvement input provider family achieve ideal . At institution , computer decision support system , Child Health Improvement Computer Automation ( CHICA ) system routinely conduct surveillance screen commonly encounter pediatric topic . The investigator build upon exist ADHD CHICA module , conduct annual surveillance inattentive symptom integrate validate screen tool anxiety , associate surveillance item prompt pediatrician begin improve identification ADHD anxiety . Aim 1 : Expand modify CHICA decision support system improve diagnostic process screen child inattention , include screen wait room , physician prompt , tailor diagnostic brief counseling tool . Aim 2 : Improve physician awareness identification referral pattern child present inattentive symptom provide run chart physician screening , referral medication prescribe pattern pair facilitated discussion share strategy improve diagnostic process obtain preliminary feedback future health information technology development comprehensive anxiety module . Aim 3 : Examine effect CHICA anxiety module diagnostic process physician screen child inattentive symptom . - Sub-aim 3 ( ) : Evaluate agreement positive anxiety screen result obtain Vanderbilt validate anxiety-specific screening tool . - Sub-aim 3 ( b ) : Evaluate action take pediatrician prompt result positive screen . - Sub-aim 3 ( c ) : Compare rate ICD-9 diagnosis anxiety ADHD use billing data rate psychotropic medication ( stimulant ADHD versus anxiolytic anxiety ) use e-prescribing data .</detailed_description>
