	<brief_summary>Achieving gastro-jejunal duodenal anastomosis ( GJA ) exclusive endoscopically real goal many year development research transluminal endoscopic surgery ( N.O.T.E.S ) . Endoscopic treatment , include palliative antro duodenal stenosis metallic stent , although minimally invasive , cause problem long-term secondary obstruction migration . Surgical treatment stricture associate significant morbidity mortality . The complication rate severity post-operative surgery gastric bypass Roux-en-Y anastomosis gastroduodenal fistula remain close 5 % mortality 1 % . After 3 year experimental research porcine model , team develop procedure gastro duodenal anastomosis use transgastric endoscopic minimally invasive surgical technique ( NOTES ) - LBA UMRT24 CERC laboratory , Aix-Marseille University , Faculty Medicine North , aim offer credible alternative conventional surgery . Thus investigator propose conduct pilot prospective intervenionnal study . The investigator hypothetized technique would reduce morbidity mortality clinical also economic consequence surgery make possible obtain excellent result permeability long-term functionality . This method use new concept tissue apposition fully cover metallic stent create anastomosis endoscopy exclusively . Ten patient antro duodenal obstruction require surgical endoscopic bypass include part interventional biomedical research conduct one expert center . The duration inclusion 18 month . Then , stent remove three month insertion , end heal process , patient follow one year . The primary endpoint assessment feasibility procedure gastro duodenal anastomosis use tissue apposition stenting NOTES human . The secondary endpoint clinical efficacy , long term ( 1 year ) patency anastomosis , procedure duration , adverse event , morbidity mortality , quality life length stay . In case failure NOTES procedure , patient treat either surgery conventional endoscopy accord usual technique without loss chance . The risk / benefit ratio appear positive safety report issue first 4 inclusion . There supplementary examination patient follow-up study CT iconography biology enough . The material use context work consistent legislation medical device receive CE Mark ( tissue apposition fully cover stent Axios Â® ) .</brief_summary>
