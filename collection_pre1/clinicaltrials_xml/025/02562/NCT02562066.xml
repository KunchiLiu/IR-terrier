	<detailed_description>Each patient participate open-label unblinded drug escalation/treatment run-in phase 4 week stable dose frequency amifampridine phosphate achieve 7 day . After phase , blind treatment effect assess randomized fashion continuation cessation drug ( Placebo ) start Period I ( duration 7 day ) . Following experimental Period 1 , patient return stable dose administered end open-label run-in period approximately 2 week , follow cross treatment Period 2 dose 7 day . After completion Period 2 , patient eligible expanded access restoration open-label amifampridine phosphate dose frequency establish run phase study .</detailed_description>
