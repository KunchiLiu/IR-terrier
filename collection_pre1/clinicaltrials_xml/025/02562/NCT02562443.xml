	<brief_summary>The study 's primary objective [ population patient MDS failure treatment azacitidine ( AZA ) decitabine ( DAC ) ] , compare overall survival ( OS ) patient rigosertib group v Physician 's Choice group , patient subgroup patient IPSS-R high risk .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Controlled Study Rigosertib Versus Physician 's Choice Treatment MDS Patients After Failure HMA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase III , open-label , randomize , control , international study . Approximately 225 patient &lt; 82 year age MDS classify RAEB-1 , RAEB-2 , RAEB-t receive AZA DAC ≤ 9 month and/or ≤ 9 cycle 12 month last dose AZA DAC within 6 month prior screen stratify : - Very high risk ( VHR ) vs non-VHR per IPSS-R , - Geographic region ( North America v Europe v Asia ; approve product standard care may vary region ) , randomly assign 2:1 ratio one follow 2 treatment group : - Rigosertib 1800 mg/24 hr administer 72 hr CIV infusion Days 1 , 2 , 3 2 week cycle first 8 cycle , Days 1 , 2 , 3 4-week cycle thereafter ( N = approximately 150 patient ) ; - Physician 's Choice alternative treatment , may include approved standard-of-care therapy patient show hypersensitive , base frequently use treatment MDS , per institutional guideline , receipt HMAs ( N = approximately 75 patient ) . The drug use Physician 's Choice arm use accord recommendation , clinically appropriate , provide corresponding Summary Product Characteristics ( SmPC ) Prescribing Information drug . Experimental therapy allow PC arm . Patients treated 2006 IWG progression criterion meet ( ie , 50 % increase BM blast worsen cytopenia ) unacceptable toxicity intolerance . For randomized patient discontinue study treatment , subsequent therapy start end date , well survival time treatment discontinuation , document least monthly death . Patients PC group progress allow cross rigosertib . All patient treatment group allow , medically justified , access RBC platelet transfusion growth factor ( granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) , erythropoietin , thrombopoietin ) .</detailed_description>
