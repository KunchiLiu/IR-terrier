	<brief_summary>Rett Syndrome ( RTT ) complex disorder result mutation gene encode MeCP2 protein . Currently , method fix abnormal gene , however , animal study suggest symptom RTT treat . Ketamine sedative anesthetic , depend dose . The drug approve US Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) commonly use child adult . Animal study case report human suggest ketamine may reduce symptom Rett syndrome . The purpose study determine safety efficacy ketamine treat breathe behavioral symptom RTT .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Exploratory Trial Ketamine Treatment Rett Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Families ask maintain current prescription medication expect three-month duration study . However , clinically indicated medication alteration naturally permit record . Each participant experience four study day , separated month . On three study day participant give Ketamine , day give saline placebo . Studies conduct Cleveland Clinic 's General Clinical Research Unit NIH-sponsored unit design study . Subjects admit first day study sequence , discharge subsequent day . Study subject arrive approximately 8:00 AM . Age , weight height determine prescription medication record . Subjects fit sensor record respiration , heart rate brain electrical activity ( electroencephalogram , EEG ) . Treatment administration start noon . To avoid potential effect circadian variation , treatment administration start time study day subject . Because half-life Ketamine short ( t1/2 = 10-15 minute sedation/anesthesia ) , expect participate patient fully recover potential sedating effect Ketamine within hour two . Each subject randomize receive 3 5 dos Ketamine 0.1 , 0.5 , 1.0 , 2.0 4.5 mg/kg ] plus placebo , total 4 period ( visit ) . Ordering treatment randomize , patient earlier study receive low dos Ketamine . The study drug give constant infusion 0.1 , 0.5 , 1.0 , 2.0 4.5 mg/kg course 40 minute . Apnea/breath-hold index , hyperventilation cardio-respiratory coupling index measure polysomnography ( PSG ) , treatment . EEG record , treatment . Auditory evoked potential ( AEP ) record day treatment . Rett Syndrome Behavior Questionnaire ( RSBQ ) administer multiple time treatment , first hospital home . Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised ( RBSR ) administer day treatment . Before infusion one hour infusion , mL peripheral blood sample measure bio-markers . Blood centrifuge plasma frozen subsequent analysis .</detailed_description>
