	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well fluorouracil , irinotecan hydrochloride , oxaliplatin ( combination chemotherapy ) work compare gemcitabine hydrochloride paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation surgery treat patient pancreatic cancer remove surgery . Drugs use chemotherapy , fluorouracil , irinotecan hydrochloride , oxaliplatin , gemcitabine hydrochloride , paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) may kill tumor cell . It yet know whether combination chemotherapy effective gemcitabine hydrochloride paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation surgery treat pancreatic cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S1505 : Combination Chemotherapy Gemcitabine Hydrochloride Paclitaxel Albumin-Stabilized Nanoparticle Formulation Before Surgery Treating Patients With Pancreatic Cancer That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess 2-year overall survival treatment arm ( fluorouracil , irinotecan hydrochloride , oxaliplatin [ modify ( ) FOLFIRINOX ] gemcitabine [ gemcitabine hydrochloride ] /nab-paclitaxel [ paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation ] ) patient resectable pancreatic cancer . II . If state threshold meet one arm : choose good regimen respect 2-year overall survival . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate , patient within treatment arm : frequency severity adverse event associate chemotherapy perioperative setting . II . To estimate , patient within treatment arm : proportion patient go surgery resection preoperative chemotherapy . III . To estimate , patient within treatment arm : proportion patient achieve macroscopically complete tumor removal negative microscopic surgical margin ( R0 ) resection preoperative chemotherapy . IV . To estimate , patient within treatment arm : overall response rate follow preoperative chemotherapy , include confirm unconfirmed , complete partial response , per Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 . V. To estimate , patient within treatment arm : pathologic response rate R0 macroscopically complete tumor removal positive microscopic surgical margin ( R1 ) resection . VI . To estimate , patient within treatment arm : pattern recurrence ( loco-regional , distant ) R0 R1 resection . VII . To estimate , patient within treatment arm : disease-free survival time R0 R1 resection . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive oxaliplatin intravenously ( IV ) 2 hour irinotecan hydrochloride IV 90 minute day 1 15 . Patients also receive fluorouracil IV 46 hour day 1-3 15-17 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve stable disease well undergo pancreatectomy 4-8 week completion first 3 course treatment . Within 4-8 week follow pancreatectomy , patient receive additional 3 course oxaliplatin , irinotecan hydrochloride , fluorouracil treatment absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation IV 30 minute gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve stable disease well undergo pancreatectomy 4-8 week completion first 3 course treatment . Within 4-8 week follow pancreatectomy , patient receive additional 3 course paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation gemcitabine hydrochloride treatment absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
