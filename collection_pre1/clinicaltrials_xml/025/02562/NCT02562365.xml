	<brief_summary>Ovarian cancer mostly diagnose late stage ( III/IV ) high rate recurrence first line therapy optimal cytoreductive sugery 6-8cycle TP chemotherapy . We develop adjuvant chemotherapy `` three step '' ( ACTS ) . It add CTX+VP-16 ( second step ) 6cycle CTX+CBP ( third step ) firstline chemotherapy ( first step ) . The aim study verify effectivity safety ACTS .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adjuvant Chemotherapy Three-step Regimen Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>More 70 percent ovarian cancer patient diagnose advanced stage . Currently 5-year disease free survival ( DFS ) stageⅢC-Ⅳovarian cancer patient 10 percent first line chemotherapy . Dr Cai shumo develop adjuvant chemotherapy `` three step '' ( ACTS ) advance ovarian cancer cytoreductive surgery , base 60+ year experience gynecologic oncology . After first step 6-8 cycle paclitaxel plus carboplatin chemotherapy , chemo-sensative cancer cell kill , resistant/dormancy cell remain . The second step chemotherapy 6 cycle CTX+VP-16 every 4weeks , use different mechanism kill cancer cell , may decrease rate recurrence within 6 month first step chemotherapy , prolong platinum-free duration also acceptable side effect . After second step chemotherapy , absence 6 month platinum treatment , previous G0 dormancy cell may become flexible platinum treatment . Therefore , third step chemotherapy , CTX+CBP use every 8 week 6 cycle . Comparing use targeted therapy maintain therapy , ACTS cost less . In previous observation study ( CHINA ONCOLOGY 2013 Vol.23 No.12 p980 ) , In study arm A , patient receive three-step chemotherapy primary debulking surgery , step one paclitaxel plus carboplatin ( TC regimen ) , every 3 week 6 8 cycle ; step two etoposide plus cyclophosphamide , every 4 week 6 cycle ; step three carboplatin plus cyclophosphamide every eight week six cycle . In control arm B , investigator retrospectively analyse 51 case withⅢC-Ⅳstage ovarian cancer , completely response standard chemotherapy six eight cycle TC primary surgery 2007 . Investigators compare 5-year DFS two arm . Results : The 5-year DFS 15 case arm A 80 % ( 12/15 ) , signiifcantly high arm B ( 5.9 % , 3/51 , P &lt; 0.01 ) . Therefore start randomize open control clinic trial evaluate effect ACTS overall survival safety .</detailed_description>
