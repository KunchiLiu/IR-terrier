	<brief_title>SBRT ( Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy ) v . Surgery High Risk Patients With Early Stage Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The development SBRT treatment stage I NSCLC ( non-small cell lung cancer ) inspire collaboration thoracic surgery radiation oncology prompt investigator work closely together evaluate relative role SBRT surgery . Comparative study modality limit number often difficult interpret due variability methodological issue . The productive collaboration result publication several study compare SBRT surgery utilize propensity score base analysis match patient group . However , match limited number variable patient ultimately select therapy base largely real perceived comorbidity lead significant reporting bias , therefore method comprehensively assess comorbidity necessary . As extension , real ongoing challenge investigator evaluate within clinical practice current guideline define high risk patient subjective prone physician bias . A recent secondary analysis clinical trial inclusion criterion SBRT underscore bias demonstrate many patient consider inoperable perhaps reasonable surgical candidate . Based standard pulmonary function test inoperable SBRT patient diffusion capacity 33 % high high risk surgical patient ACOSOG Z4032 . Conversely , stratification high risk surgical patient within ACOSOG Z4032 trial identify extremely high risk subset ( median DLCO % 30 % , FEV1 % 39 % ) 90-day 3+ adverse event rate 48 % compare low risk subset ( DLCO % 69 % , FEV1 % 56 % ) 90-day 3+ adverse event rate 24 % . In absence clinical trial prospective database , currently objective algorithm guide assignment surgery versus SBRT . Attempts objectively stratify risk within surgical population challenge . Risk model base European Thoracic Database Society Thoracic Surgeons Database yet robust enough guide decision-making regard treatment assignment classification high risk surgical patient alternative therapy may preferable . Unfortunately , one current limitation stratify high risk patient patient follow physician independent specialty . The STS Thoracic Surgical Database include patient undergo SBRT therefore difficult create inclusive algorithm operable inoperable patient . A principle objective study create validate risk model treatment selection . This greatly enhance ability counsel patient regard specific risks/benefit ratio surgery SBRT . This improve inform decision make part patient , remove much subjectivity treatment selection . Inclusion unique metric HRQOL data bolster benefit patient make patient-centric , rather focus cancer outcomes alone . As implementation Affordable HealthCare Act ( AHCA ) continue , physician experience additional pressure cut cost maintain improve quality care provide . The current fee-for-service system often criticize compartmentalize fragment without well-defined incentive quality improvement . Initiatives AHCA include effort test care model reduce hospital associate condition , bundle payment plan care improvement , share saving program accountable care organization whereby participate provider meet certain quality standard share saving achieve Medicare program . These effort design rein cost medical care improve transparency quality care . Pilot effort involve bundle payment coronary artery bypass grafting result Medicare saving $ 40 million simultaneous reduce in-hospital mortality . These type initiative likely become commonplace United States effort create new model care constrain cost introduce . With stimulus initiative novel system healthcare delivery investigator recognize model bundle payment treatment stage I NSCLC may reduce overall cost associate treatment stage I lung cancer potentially improve quality care provide . At Washington University investigator take preemptive measure create accountable care organization ( ACO ) Department Radiation Oncology Department Thoracic Surgery focus approach treatment stage I NSCLC . Important component collaborative effort include bundle payment system episodes care involve treatment selection , implementation , follow care patient stage I lung cancer well prospective assessment quality care measure . The impetus development unique collaboration radiation oncology thoracic surgery stem ongoing interest improve quality care patient early stage NSCLC . The clinical research focus determine best treatment strategy significant number patient stage I lung cancer consider medically inoperable high risk surgical candidate . In age population , pulmonary insufficiency , cardiac disease , well comorbidities may preclude surgery place patient significant risk complication surgery . The evolution stereotactic body radiotherapy ( SBRT ) medically inoperable population result relatively low local recurrence rate range 3-20 % favorable overall disease-free survival inoperable patient Stage I NSCLC .</detailed_description>
