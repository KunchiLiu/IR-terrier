	<brief_summary>The purpose 2-part open-label study investigate safety efficacy [ 18F ] MK-6240 Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) image agent quantify brain burden neurofibrillary tangle ( NFT ) pathology . Brain NFT deposition pathology find Alzheimer 's Disease ( AD ) , density brain NFTs show correlate severity cognitive impairment AD . The objective study include perform follow respect [ 18F ] MK-6240 administer PET image agent : ass safety tolerability ; determine radiation safety profile ; determine optimal image protocol parameter quantification brain NFTs AD ; compare tracer bind brain PET scan participant AD varying severity , participant amnestic mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) healthy elderly participant ; evaluate intra-subject test-retest ( T-RT ) variability tracer uptake brain region interest . The primary efficacy hypothesis intra-subject T-RT variability brain region associate NFT deposition AD ≤10 % .</brief_summary>
