	<brief_summary>Background : Endocrine therapy standard treatment hormone receptor positive breast cancer . However , primary acquire resistance occurs , good strategy improve treatment outcome overcome resistance urgently need . There know cross talk RET ER , preclinical study suggest combine RET inhibitor endocrine therapy may improve cell kill breast cancer cell line . Aim : To determine safe dose lenvatinib co-administered letrozole phase Ib study , follow phase II study determine efficacy lenvatinib + letrozole post-menopausal patient newly diagnose hormone receptor positive breast cancer neoadjuvant setting . Methods : Eligible patient treat 2 week single agent lenvatinib , follow 12 week lenvatinib + letrozole . Blood tumor sample obtain patient serially study tumor host factor may influence drug efficacy toxicity . Importance propose research : The combination lenvatinib + letrozole may improve treatment response ER+ breast cancer . The study seek identify biomarkers ( eg tumor RET expression ) may select patient likely benefit combination therapy . Potential benefit risk : The combination may improve treatment response . Adding lenvatinib may increase treatment risk , monitor closely . Pharmacokinetic analysis also perform determine drug level achieve patient , correlate treatment toxicity efficacy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Breast cancer commonest cancer among female Singapore worldwide . Approximately 60-70 % breast cancer hormone receptor positive thus potentially sensitive endocrine therapy . However , primary acquire resistance endocrine therapy exist , good combination constantly explore delay endocrine resistance improve treatment outcome . Several known mechanism endocrine resistance propose , include deregulation various component ER pathway , alteration cell cycle cell survival signal molecule , activation escape pathway provide tumor alternative proliferative survival stimulus . Endocrine blockade breast cancer achieve reduce level estrogens ovarian ablation ( medical , surgical , radiation ) pre-menopausal woman administration aromatase inhibitor post-menopausal woman . Direct inhibition estrogen receptor achieve administer selective estrogen receptor modulators , tamoxifen , pure estrogen receptor antagonist fulvestrant . In post-menopausal woman advance breast cancer , current standard first-line endocrine therapy comprise reversible aromatase inhibitor letrozole anastrozole . Other endocrine therapy option advance breast cancer include irreversible aromatase inhibitor ( exemestane ) , tamoxifen , megestrol acetate , novel combination aromatase inhibitor fulvestrant ( combine estrogen blockade ) , exemestane combine mTOR inhibitor ( everolimus ) , letrozole combine CDK4/6 inhibitor ( palbociclib ) . RET estrogen response gene , preclinical study demonstrate cross talk RET ER . Significant interaction RET ERa pathways describe , increased response estrogen stimulation observe presence functional RET . RET associate resistance tamoxifen aromatase inhibitor , increase RET expression demonstrate hormone resistant cell line primary tumor . Combined anti-estrogen anti-RET therapy luminal breast cancer great effect cell growth either therapy alone . The two class drug different mechanism action ; RET TKI reduce growth induction apoptosis , anti-ERa reduce cell proliferation , form biologic basis dual treatment . Dual therapy tamoxifen vandetinib , RET inhibitor , result great reduction tumor growth rate MCF7 xenograft mouse . RET report over-expressed 75 % ER+ breast cancer ( n=20 ) , compare 10 % ER-negative breast cancer ( n=10 ) small study .</detailed_description>
