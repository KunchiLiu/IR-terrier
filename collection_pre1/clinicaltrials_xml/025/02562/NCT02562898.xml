	<brief_summary>Gemcitabine nab-paclitaxel standard regimen ( NCCN , Category 1 ) patient metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( PDAC ) . However , improvement treatment need . Increasingly , nature immune infiltrate PDAC appear tumor promote . In preclinical study , ibrutinib treatment , presumably reprogramming B cell , result increase CD8+ T cell assist tumor control . Preclinical study ibrutinib plus gemcitabine show superior antitumor effect compare gemcitabine alone orthotopic murine pancreatic cancer cell line graft genetically engineer mouse model . Thus , investigator propose clinical trial ibrutinib plus standard gemcitabine base regimen gemcitabine nab-paclitaxel , evaluate safety , efficacy include correlative study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ibrutinib Combined With Gemcitabine Nab-Paclitaxel Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pancreatic adenocarcinoma ( PDAC ) represent fourth lead cause cancer-related mortality United States , estimate 39,950 death attributable PDAC 2014 ( http : //seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/pancreas.html ) . Over 90 % patient inoperable disease presentation , point systemic therapy become primary form treatment . Treating PDAC challenge approve drug available . Recently , however , breakthrough occur , raise hope aggressive disease well control . FOLFIRINOX , combination 5FU , oxaliplatin , irinotecan , find substantially superior treatment gemcitabine alone patient metastatic disease good performance status . Similarly , gemcitabine nab-paclitaxel , regimen less non-hematologic toxicity , demonstrate improved overall survival progression-free survival compare gemcitabine alone . Both combination modification combination front line option patient good performance status . Furthermore , improvement survival , however incremental , afford patient pancreatic cancer time participate possibly benefit clinical trial novel therapeutic .</detailed_description>
