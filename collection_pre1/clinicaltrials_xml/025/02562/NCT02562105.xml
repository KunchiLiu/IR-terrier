	<brief_title>Prognosis Hematological Cancer Patient Underwent Mechanical Ventillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It believe many year scene cancer patient require mechanical ventilation frustrating . The needed life support measure drain much health resource add significant burden patient 's family . Many factor responsible high mortality rate among hematologic cancer patient admit intensive care unit . Among factor , invasive treatment frequently employ today 's intensive care unit . These procedure give chance development severe infection multiple organ failure common event immune-compromised patient ( e.g . neutropenia ) expose chemotherapy . The common form organ failure patient acute respiratory failure major predictor mortality population . The prognosis failure may vary depend cause severity , co morbidity , associate acute organ failure character underlying malignancy . After recent advance field intensive care shed light benefit noninvasive ventilation immune-compromised patient , overall survival rate cancer patient admit intensive care unit improving .</detailed_description>
