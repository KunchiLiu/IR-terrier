	<brief_summary>It convincingly demonstrate electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) work well sooner antidepressant treatment certain subtypes depression . Given effectiveness , would unfortunate give ECT patient good response chance could substantially shorten length severe depressive episode . Instead go possible psychopharmacological treatment step , ECT could propose much earlier treatment option patient might good response chance . This would great advantage severely depressed patient , decrease disease-burden hospitalization duration . However , , objective reliable predictive factor good ECT response yet establish . Clinical characteristic psychomotor retardation , psychotic feature age often use predict outcome ECT , little evidence consider strong predictive factor . The current project design allow good prediction ECT-response . The investgators base selection predictor clinical impression previous research result . The predictive capacity psychomotor functioning , psychotic symptom several biomarkers investigate . With clinical biological patient depression characteristic , investigator aim develop decision make tool allow accurate indication ECT . The investigator also investigate way predict whether patient good response treatment already start , base early improvement psychomotor functioning . Another subject great importance predict prevent side-effects . When patient risk last cognitive side-effects identify early treatment course , treatment adjust prevent persistence memory problem . Therefore , second part study focus identify people risk cognitive side effect early treatment course .</brief_summary>
