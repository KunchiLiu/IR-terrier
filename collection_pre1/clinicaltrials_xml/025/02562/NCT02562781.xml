	<brief_summary>Patients undergo vascular surgery significantly high risk perioperative cardiovascular , cerebral renal event compare undergoing non-vascular surgery . This could co-morbidities common patient group . Additionally , smoking , common population , may contribute factor . Oxygen therapy use decade order reduce risk myocardial infarction stroke patient undergo vascular surgery pre-existing co-morbidities belief increase inspired oxygen increase oxygen delivery tissue , thereby reduce risk hypoxia cell death . However , several study publish recently question routine use high inspire oxygen concentration ( hyperoxia ) improve oxygen delivery , specifically neonatal period possibly even follow myocardial infarction . This could explain fact increase inspired concentration oxygen cause vasoconstriction cerebral coronary artery , thereby reduce blood flow . Additionally , increase oxygen cause excessive production reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) , repercussion injury oxidative stress . The latter lead apoptosis ( cell death ) myocardial cerebral neuron . Despite high risk administer oxygen need , routinely use hospital world without doctor prescription . This study aim ass peri-operative complication 1 year follow vascular surgery patient randomise receive high inspire oxygen concentration ( endpoint : SpO2 98 - 100 % ) minimal inspire O2 concentration ( endpoint : SpO2 &gt; 90 % ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Oxygen probably one common `` non-prescription '' drug use hospital advantage several situation include carbon monoxide poisoning , central hypoxia prior plan intubation acute situation today well-established commonly use . Oxygen frown upon resuscitation newborn baby risk retrolental hypoplasia , well accept adopt clinical practice . Oxygen also traditionally used increase oxygen carry capacity patient present acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) , reduce surgical site infection ( SSI ) , ensure adequate oxygen delivery tissue unconscious patient , cardiac surgery postoperative management , specifically major surgery . Thus , deliberate use high inspiratory oxygen concentration ( e.g. , 80 % ) recommend treatment specific intoxication , carbon monoxide cyanide , wherein hyperbaric oxygen also consider . In addition , high oxygen fraction suggest prevent adverse outcome surgery anesthesia , include reduction wound infection postoperative nausea vomiting ( PONV ) . In critically ill patient , oxygen delivery tissue often compromise , supplemental oxygen ( e.g. , face mask 10 L oxygen per min ) commonly administer patient pneumonia , sepsis , acute coronary syndrome , stroke - fact , estimate oxygen give transport approximately one-third ambulance journey . Several report publish recently question many `` routine '' use oxygen evidence even seem point towards negative outcome condition . Specifically , excessive oxygen likely harm good neonatal period , follow cardio-pulmonary resuscitation likely follow acute myocardial infarction . Prospective , randomised study important use oxygen preoperative string , however , lack literature view theoretical risk hyperoxemia several organ , routine use high oxygen fraction peri-operative phase question . This study aim ass peri-operative complication 1 year follow vascular surgery patient randomise receive high inspire oxygen concentration ( endpoint : SpO2 98 - 100 % ) minimal inspire O2 concentration ( endpoint : SpO2 &gt; 90 % ) .</detailed_description>
