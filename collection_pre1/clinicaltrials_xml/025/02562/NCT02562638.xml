	<detailed_description>Introduction , background justification study Patients traditionally keep Nulla-Per-Os/Nil-By-Mouth ( NPO/NBM ) 4-6 hour prior cardiac procedure include : diagnostic coronary angiogram , right heart catheter , percutaneous coronary intervention device therapy minimize risk vomit pulmonary aspiration sedation general anesthesia . The risk develop pulmonary aspiration 0.0015 % follow emergency coronary artery bypass ( CABG ) surgery patient without pre-procedural fasting . There currently data available regard risk aspiration cardiac angiographic intervention , risk likely low emergency CABG . Currently North-American European guideline require patient fasted cardiac procedure . The incidence emergency CABG follow cardiac catheterization 0.15 % 0.4 % , whilst cardiac arrest 1 % . In subset patient develop cardiac arrest elective cardiac catheterization PCI , incidence pulmonary aspiration low similar survivor non-survivors ( 8.9 % patient develop cardiac arrest ) . Unsurprisingly , patient admit acute MI undergo Primary PCI ( PPCI ) fast beforehand need emergency intubation/CABG remains rare patient . A study show rare occurrence pulmonary aspiration general anesthesia risk 0.02 % elective 0.1 % emergency procedure . In two randomized control trial , case pulmonary aspiration report despite absence pre-procedure fasting use Midazolam/Diazepam/etomidate . Similarly , observational study patient develop pulmonary aspiration . A Cochrane review show increase risk pulmonary aspiration shorter fluid fast . A review article report increase risk pulmonary aspiration non-fasted patient emergency department . However , prospective multicenter emergency-department study 2623 patient reveal one patient develop aspiration pneumonia follow use sedation . There current consensus anesthesia literature safe healthy individual drink clear fluid 2 hour induction general anesthesia . It recommend 2 hour fast clear fluid , 6 hour solid support concept pre-operative oral nutrition use special carbohydrate-rich beverage . On hand , coronary procedure require use intravenous contrast , precipitate acute renal impairment . It show proper hydration reduce risk contrast-induced nephropathy . A review study suggest oral route effective intravenous route volume expansion reduction contrast-induced acute kidney injury . A prospective study demonstrate lack fasting associate high incidence adverse event child undergo pre-procedural sedation emergency department . A recent clinical policy publish American College Emergency Physicians ; recommend ( Level B ) , procedural sedation emergency department delay base fasting status . Similarly , recent retrospective study 1900 patient UK , demonstrate patient need NPO prior Percutaneous Coronary Intervention ( PCI ) . Another study demonstrate reduced gastric pH ( &lt; 2.0 ) increase gastric volume predispose pulmonary aspiration . Invasive procedure angiography angioplasty associate small risk adverse event . One adverse event vasovagal reaction occur 3-4 % patient may exacerbate depletion volume see fasted state . Current status University Health Network UHN policy require patient fast solid liquid minimum 4 hour cardiac catheterization . The investigator explore fast protocol different current UHN policy Introduction , background justification study : UHN policy require patient fast solid liquid minimum 4 hour cardiac catheterization . The investigator explore fast protocol different current UHN policy involve staff cardiothoracic surgery anesthesiology team , also act safety monitor part Data Safety Monitoring Board ensure participant safe harm adverse effect . Currently publish data association fast state peri-procedural vasovagal symptom reduction procedural satisfaction . Hypothesis : A liberal fasting protocol ( fast &gt; 4 hour solid , encouraging oral clear fluid 1 hour prior procedure ) associate low incidence peri-procedural vasovagal complication current standard fasting protocol ( &gt; 4 hour solids fluid ) Methods experimental design : This prospective single-blind randomize pilot study . The Cardiac Interventionists involve procedure blind randomization . All patient undergoing cardiac invasive procedure screen eligibility . The participant randomise 2 group ( eligibility criterion outcome measure mention different section ) . Study Groups Group 1 - Control Group : Participants fast accord current standard practice UHN ( minimum 4 hour fast period liquid solid food ) . Group 2 - Intervention group : Participants allow ( encourage ) drink clear fluid 1 hour procedure . Solid food allow 4 hour procedure current standard practice UHN . Enrolment randomization : Participants qualify study approach person prior ( in-patient ) day procedure ( ambulatory ) obtain write informed consent prior randomization . A verbal explanation write information form patient information sheet give participant . They approach co-investigators involve care give least 4-24 hour consent study . They much time need consider study . They also opportunity discuss family , friends family doctor . They give contact detail on-site research team include study doctor nurse able answer query point study . They notify oblige participate study decide take part change mind point withdraw study unconditionally withdrawal affect future care . Vulnerable group participate research hence special measure take recruitment . Participants also inform potential safety concern may arise study advise treatment option . Wherever possible Hospitals translation service use offer translation consent form patient English first language . Other individual , require specialist communication visually impaired suffer deafness wherever possible , accommodated hospital on-site service . Throughout study participant 's identity protect disclose outside Hospital keep University Hospital Network ( UHN ) Patient Health Information ( PHI ) policy . At begin study investigator receive identification log enable record patient study pseudonymised identification number . This record remain central research office participate center act reference document PI . Data case report form ( CRFs ) store onsite computer . The hard copy CRFs keep research doctor 's office -the person able access case report form PI cardiology research doctor nurse delegated study purpose . Follow : Participants request return one blood test day 3 day 5 post- procedure . To public transport cost provide patient one accompany person need . A telephonic follow also undertaken one week ensure adverse event occur . Baseline investigations/Information : At time procedure , investigator obtain record following : Pre-procedural Information 1 . Pre-procedure investigation ( Hemoglobin , Urea , Creatinine , eGFR ) 2 . Patient demographic ( Diabetes Mellitus { DM } , hypertension { HTN } , renal impairment , peripheral vascular disease { PVD } ) 3 . Index admission diagnosis ( NSTEMI , Chronic stable angina ) 4 . Weight , height Body Mass Index ( BMI ) 5 . Medications admission Procedural post-procedural information record , include : 1 . Type procedure 2 . Route ( access site-femoral radial ) procedure 3 . Intra-procedural detail ( sedation , analgesia , complication , devices-used ) 4 . Procedural post-procedural outcome ( Success , in-hospital complication , discharge time date , complication include mortality aspiration pneumonia ) 5 . Patient satisfaction survey 6 . Post-procedural creatinine 7 . Post-procedural telephonic call one week date procedure Statistical analysis Demographic procedural variable present percentage ( categorical variable ) mean ± SD ( continuous variable ) . Comparison demographic procedural variable two group perform chi-square Fisher 's exact test categorical variable student 's test continuous variable . Statistical analysis perform use SPSS version 22 . Randomization perform systematic random sample utilizing online computer generate random number assignment tool . Sample size calculation : Sample size calculate base proportion effect size . A total sample size 240 patient ( 120 patient arm ) would 80 % power detect 1.0 % incidence vasovagal reaction intervention arm ( α 0.05 ) . Funding : This study fund UHN Innovation Committee . Once outcomes pilot study available safety endpoint accomplish , , investigator consider conduct similar multicentre study . Ethics : All aspect Good Clinical Practice adhere . Patient confidentiality maintain per data protection policy include anonymising data . Ethical approval obtain REB routine channel ( CAPCR ) .</detailed_description>
