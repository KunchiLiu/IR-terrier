	<brief_summary>Activation blood platelet typical find patient systemic inflammation sepsis.They seem mediate key pro-inflammatory mediator secretion , immune-cell activation adhesion endothelium enhance pro-coagulatory activity endothelial cell impair microcirculation thus , may lead multiple organ dysfunction . However , exact effect bacterial product platelet function find consistent may vary accord specie , time study , pathogenesis sepsis . Data vary , include increase decreased platelet reactivity aggregation among patient sepsis compare healthy control . Defining platelet 's behaviour sepsis particularly important view recent finding reveal potential association antiplatelet therapy reduction short term mortality , incidence acute lung injury intensive care unit admission critically ill patients.This study aim measure P2Y12 mediate platelet reactivity , -using point-of-care P2Y12 VerifyNow assay , platelet reactivity unit ( PRU ) - along different stage sepsis , include bacteremia/uncomplicated infection , sepsis , severe sepsis septic shock . Subgroup follow patient go along different stage also perform . At end study analysis clinical laboratory finding correlation platelet reactivity perform assess platelet aggregation sepsis .</brief_summary>
