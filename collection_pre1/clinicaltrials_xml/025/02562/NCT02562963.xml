	<brief_summary>Natural killer T ( NKT ) cell unique subset lymphocytes present mixed T-NK phenotype . Our hypothesis Natural killer T cell may decrease tumor burden improve overall survival . The purpose study determine whether Natural killer T ( NKT ) cell effective safe treatment patient unresectable advanced solid tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Efficacy Safety NKT Cell Infusion Patients With Advanced Solid Tumor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>According Annual Report Cancer Registration China 2014 , lung cancer , gastric cancer , liver cancer colorectal cancer become top 4 solid tumor high morbidity mortality rate . So far , main treatment modality tumor surgery , radiotherapy chemotherapy . However , effect conventional therapy advance cancer limit , tumor metastasis major cause death patient advance cancer . With development oncology immunology recent year , immunotherapy represent novel path obtain durable long-lasting response cancer patient . Natural killer T ( NKT ) cell unique subset lymphocytes present mixed T-NK phenotype . NKT cell expand conventionally peripheral blood mononuclear cell addition variety cytokine vitro culture . Our previous study demonstrate expansion NKT cell clinical usage scale peripheral blood mononuclear cell feasible . Those expand NKT cell exhibit antitumor effect vitro vivo ( tumor -bearing nude mouse ) variety tumor cell . Furthermore , intravenous infusion single dose 4X10^9 NKT cell mice prove safe . The purpose study evaluate efficacy safety NKT cell patient unresectable advanced solid tumor .</detailed_description>
