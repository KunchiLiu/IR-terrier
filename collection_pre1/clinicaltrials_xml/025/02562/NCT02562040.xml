	<brief_title>Pediatric Adenotonsillectomy Snoring</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adenotonsillectomies perform 500,000 time per year United States , common surgery perform general anesthesia child . The majority surgery perform obstructed breathing rather infection indication . The role adenotonsillectomy ( AT ) improve 7-month neurocognitive , behavioral health outcome child frank obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) recently address Childhood Adenotonsillectomy Trial ( CHAT ) . The result rigorous , multicenter , randomize control trial provide critically important data indicate adenotonsillectomy compare watchful wait result improved behavior , quality life , sleep-disordered breathing ( SDB ) symptoms polysomnographic parameter . However , Childhood Adenotonsillectomy Trial address role surgery minority operative candidate frank obstructive sleep apnea , one form sleep disorder breathe spectrum include common phenotype , primary snoring ( also term mild sleep disorder breathing ( MSDB ) ) . Mild sleep disorder breathe characterize snoring without frank obstruction gas exchange abnormality , population prevalence 10 % child . Since surgery obstruct breathe perform mild sleep disorder breathe rather obstructive sleep apnea , next logical question whether surgery also effective improve symptom health outcomes large group child . The Pediatric Adenotonsillectomy Trial Snoring ( PATS ) intend take advantage successful collaboration leader sleep medicine , otolaryngology clinical trial efficiently leverage experience CHAT trial evaluate role adenotonsillectomy child mild sleep disorder breathing also aim resolve uncertainty regard management approach pediatric mild sleep disorder breathe address several critical issue : 1 . Assess outcomes important child family , particularly patient-reported outcome behavior , quality life , sleep disturbance . 2 . Examine difference treatment response among child increase risk mild sleep disorder breathing , pre-school child , minority , child asthma obesity . 3 . Evaluate health care utilization child mild sleep disorder breathing . 4 . Assess moderate influence second hand smoke , insufficient sleep , socioeconomic status family function 5 . Examine long term ( 12 month ) outcomes feasible Childhood Adenotonsillectomy Trial ( CHAT ) . These aim substantial public health significance give high morbidity sleep disorder breathing child .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis mild sleepdisordered breathing ( MSDB ) define meet follow criterion : Caregiver report habitual snoring occurs night least three night per week , present least three month ( average occur &gt; 3 night per week half sleep time ) Centrallyscored polysomnogram ( PSG ) confirm obstructive apnea index ( OAI ) &lt; 1/hour apneahypopnea index ( AHI ) ≤3/hour oxygen saturation ( SpO2 ) desaturation &lt; 90 % conjunction obstructive event , confirm PSG . Tonsillar hypertrophy ≥2 base standardize scale 04 . Deemed candidate AT otolaryngologist ( ENT ) evaluation ( i.e. , technical issue would contraindication surgery submucous cleft palate . ) Primary indication AT nocturnal obstructive symptom ( i.e. , recurrent infection indication ) . Previous tonsillectomy , include partial tonsillectomy Recurrent tonsillitis merit prompt adenotonsillectomy ( AT ) per American Academy OtolaryngologyHead Neck Surgery Clinical Practice Guidelines ( i.e. , ≥7 episodes/yr past year ; ≥5 episodes/year past 2 year ≥3 episodes/yr past 3 year . ) Severe obesity ( body mass index ( BMI ) zscore ≥3 ) . Failure thrive , define either height weight 5th percentile age gender . Severe chronic health condition might hamper participation confound key variable study , include limited : Severe cardiopulmonary disorder cystic fibrosis , congenital heart disease . Bleeding disorder Sickle Cell Disease Epilepsy require medication Significant cardiac arrhythmia note PSG include : nonsustained ventricular tachycardia , atrial fibrillation , second degree atrioventricular block , sustain bradycardia , sustain tachycardia . Other severe chronic health problem diabetes , narcolepsy , poorly control asthma . Known genetic , craniofacial , neurological psychiatric condition likely affect airway , cognition behavior ; Current use psychotropic medication ( medication attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , hypnotic , antihypertensive , hypoglycemic agent include insulin , anticonvulsant , anticoagulant , growth hormone . Diagnosis autism spectrum disorder . Intellectual deficit assign selfcontained classroom academic subject . History severe developmental disability Adaptive Behavior Assessment System ( ABAS3 ) score ≤60 . Children/caregivers plan move area within year . Children foster care . Children/caregivers speak English well enough complete neurobehavioral measure .</criteria>
