Specifically , future implication include : 1 ) identification biomarkers biosignatures placebo responder , 2 ) new possibility understand manipulating system , 3 ) possibly decrease eliminate major confounder clinical trial drug development , 4 ) refining treatment novel drug decrease ( clinical trial ) increase ( clinical practice ) placebo response .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neurobiological Underpinnings Placebo Response Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective pilot study investigate possible dopaminergic mechanism underlie placebo response MDD . We expect mesolimbic DA mechanism implicate reward anticipation , reinforcement learning , expectation play critical role mediate placebo response MDD . A well understanding neurobiological basis placebo enormous potential different level . On clinical level , understand placebo mechanism could lead number application therapeutic purpose , develop drug could enhance effect therapeutic relationship accelerate onset action antidepressant manipulate placebo-related mechanism , even patient hopeless severely anhedonic . On level clinical trial innovation , confirm role dopamine placebo response comprehend placebo response mechanistically take place , could lead develop new drug could block placebo effect clinical trial participant greatly decrease eliminate placebo effect nest even subject drug responder , therefore increase effect size decrease sample size study . Moreover identify biosignatures placebo effect use predict response , could potentially enrich sample subject less likely placebo responder would result increased signal detection clinical trial . Finally , initial study plan lay foundation study investigate dopaminergic circuitry affect treatment , psychotherapy , change similar different antidepressant , placebo specific form psychotherapy , transcranial magnetic stimulation , electroconvulsive therapy deep brain stimulation .</detailed_description>
