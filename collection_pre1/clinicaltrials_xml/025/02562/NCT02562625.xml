	<brief_summary>Around 13,000 participant diagnose melanoma UK year number grow quick cancer . About 20 % participant see cancer return follow initial treatment present would survive median time 912 month . In recent year , development new effective drug revolutionise treatment advanced melanoma , However , response rate still low new therapeutic approach need . This phase II study look effectiveness safety combination new drug call pembrolizumab plus radiotherapy compare pembrolizumab alone . The purpose study see addition radiotherapy pembrolizumab well pembrolizumab alone measure long treatment control growth cancer . Also assess add radiotherapy investigator see effect tumour radiotherapy also tumours rest body .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Risk burden participant Participants study cancer may still eligible standard therapy may show benefit trial drug . If case withdraw trial receive standard care . The study carry number potential burden : - Study drug Radiotherapy . Although dose safety effect drug previously assess phase I trials radiotherapy use consider standard care , possible participant experience side effect . To ensure side effect treat appropriately participant review regularly experience clinician study treatment . Comprehensive assessment safety carry . - Burden frequent hospital visit test . Participants study must attend hospital every 3 week check side effect drug , routine blood clinical biochemistry test , clinical examination administer next dose pembrolizumab . Additionally , research purpose participant may consent additional tumour biopsy blood test . These mandatory participant . 2 . Recruitment Participants offer information study clinical team consider meet entry criterion express interest take part study . It make clear necessarily therapeutic benefit take part study . It also make clear , participant decide take part future care affect . Participants give sufficient time information make inform decision enter trial , participant enter trial give write informed consent . 3 . Confidentiality Participants link unique identifier code hold password protect database held study team . This study run across twenty two hospital site . Tumour data analyse Manchester University research blood analyse Leeds University . Sample process take place use trial ID . No patient identifiable information available study sample . Investigators access patient identifiable information password protect NHS hospital note databases . 4 . Conflict Interest Participants may recruit study involve prior clinical care . Investigators expect conflict interest research healthcare duties number reason : participant must give full inform consent enter study , specifically regard unknown efficacy study drug . Those participant continue study maintain relationship clinical team require symptom control . At end study , participant able access result wish , Royal Marsden Website . They also send write summary result indicate . 5 . Use tissue sample future research If participant give consent , leftover blood tissue sample require study store future unspecified research line human tissue act regulation . Access use sample research purpose require appropriate ethical approval . Future researcher able identify individual participant biobank data , demographic clinical information available .</detailed_description>
