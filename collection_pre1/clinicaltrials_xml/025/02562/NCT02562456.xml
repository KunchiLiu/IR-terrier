	<brief_summary>The aim randomize clinical trial study compare longevity ART use high viscosity GIC conventional treatment use composite resin posterior primary teeth . As secondary outcome , cost-efficacy patient 's self-reported discomfort also test . Children age 3 6 year old presenting least one occlusal and/or occlusal-proximal cavity randomly assign two group accord dental treatment - ART high viscosity GIC ( experimental group ) composite resin restoration ( control group ) - , perform dental care trailer locate Educational Complex Barueri/SP , Brazil . The unit analysis randomization child . A number 240 teeth present occlusal cavity 188 teeth present occlusal-proximal cavity set sample size calculation . The group still stratify accord child 's caries experience . The primary outcome restoration ' longevity , assess 6 , 12 , 18 24 month two examiner clinical examination treatment accord Frencken Holmgren ( 2001 ) criterion occlusal cavity Roeleveld et al .
