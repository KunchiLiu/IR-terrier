	<brief_summary>The primary goal determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) combination T-DM1 non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin metastatic breast cancer ( mBC ) patient previously treat taxanes trastuzumab-based therapy . In addition , pharmacokinetic data combination T-DM1 lyposomal doxorubicin obtain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>T-DM1 Non-pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin HER2-positive Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects : Age ≥ 18 year HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer relapse progressed taxanes trastuzumab-based therapy . Subjects must histologic cytologic confirmation HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer . Evidence measurable evaluable metastatic disease require . Primary objective : - To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) combination T-DM1 non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin metastatic breast cancer ( mBC ) patient previously treat taxanes trastuzumab-based therapy . Secondary objective : - To determine efficacy combination T-DM1 non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin , define overall response rate ( ORR ) , clinical benefit rate ( CBR ) , number progression number reason death . - To assess safety profile combination T-DM1 non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin , define toxicity report study . - To evaluate cardiac safety combination T-DM1 non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin measure LVEF assess echocardiography , cardiac troponin I B-type natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) level . - To evaluate potential role single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) predisposition develop cardiotoxicity . - To analyze pharmacokinetics ( PK ) profile T-DM1 metabolites non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin . Type study : This prospective dose-finding , multicenter open-label phase I clinical trial . Treatment : Trastuzumab emtansine ( T-DM1 ) administer fix dose 3.6 mg/kg IV Day 1 every 3 week three cohort patient three different dose level conventional non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin ( 45 mg/m2 , 50 mg/m2 60 mg/m2 ) IV Day 1 cycle 21 day plan .</detailed_description>
