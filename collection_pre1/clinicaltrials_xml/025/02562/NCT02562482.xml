	<detailed_description>This Phase 2 , multicenter , randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blind study evaluate safety immunogenicity 2-injection vaccine regimen Chikungunya virus ( CHIKV ) virus like particle vaccine ( CHIKV VLP ) healthy adult . The hypothesis vaccine regimen safe induces neutralize antibody response CHIKV . The primary objective evaluate safety tolerability 2-injection investigational vaccine regimen VRC-CHKVLP059-00-VP 20 mcg compare placebo ( PBS ) healthy adult CHIKV endemic area . The secondary objective evaluate neutralize antibody response vaccine recipient . The exploratory objective relate assess incidence CHIKV infection vaccine placebo recipient , well antigen-specific humoral cellular immune response study . The expected duration time study per subject approximately 72 week vaccination schedule Day 0 Day 28 .</detailed_description>
