	<brief_title>Assessment Thrombotic Status Patients With Acute Coronary Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients present acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) increase risk future cardiovascular event , despite optimal medical treatment coronary intervention . Such event usually cause increased stickiness blood cause blood clot ( thrombus ) block arterial blood vessel heart . Much medication prevent recurrent thrombotic event increase risk bleed complication . Identification patient recurrent thrombotic risk could allow target treatment potent antithrombotic medication , less potent agent others reduce bleed . The investigator assess stickiness blood ( i.e . thrombotic status ) patient admit hospital ACSÍ¾ baseline , discharge hospital 30 day post hospitalisation . Blood stickiness test use number test thrombotic status include thrombin generation assay , Thromboelastography ( TEG ) near-patient , point-of-care Global Thrombosis Test ( GTT ) . The result evaluate assess effect disease process clinical state blood stickiness gain understanding condition form basis future study aim identify patient high risk future cardiovascular event .</detailed_description>
