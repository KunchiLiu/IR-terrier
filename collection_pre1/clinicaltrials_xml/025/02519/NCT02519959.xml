	<brief_summary>In head neck cancer , area tumours low oxygen supply ( call tumour hypoxia ) harbour cell resistant radiation prone metastasize . Modern radiotherapy technique precise enough deliver radiation small area could use target area receive high dos radiation rest tumour overcome resistance . Hypoxia `` see '' body use special image [ F-18 ] -FAZA-PET ( [ F-18 ] -Fluoroazomycin arabinoside positron emission tomography ) test method create radiation treatment target . As part regular pathology tumour tissue slice extremely thinly ( &lt; 1/100th millimeter ) stain individual cell see microscope . Immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) special type `` stain '' specifically highlight hypoxic area . This method consider accurate way inspect presence hypoxia . There specific stain target hypoxia ordinarily , patient ingest substance call pimonidazole-HCl build specifically hypoxic area target IHC stain . In study participant oral tongue cancer [ F-18 ] -FAZA-PET scan take single dose oral pimonidazole-HCl surgery remove cancer . The whole tumour use create microscope slide use thin slice tumour . The slice stain use IHC show pimonidazole build . Digital scan slide make use laser scanner . The hypoxia see FAZA-PET scan `` match '' hypoxia electronic slide see FAZA truly show hypoxia tumour could use way plan radiation treatment deliver radiation area .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Correlation FAZA PET Hypoxia Imaging To 3D Histology Oral Tongue Cancer ( FAITH )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Modern radiotherapy ( RT ) possess high level technical physical precision allow dose escalation level previously consider unsafe ( e.g . lung stereotactic RT ) . Due safety concern , considerable interest concept 'dose paint ' , non-uniform dose deliver biologic target volume radioresistance expect . The hypoxic target volume likely major source cancer recurrence define functional imaging ( FAZA-PET ) . However , accuracy FAZA-PET define hypoxic volume radiation target know . Finding good correlation pathology ( reference standard ) hypoxic PET target would provide foundation feasible dose escalation clinical trial high risk head neck cancer finally take advantage technical improvement radiation delivery . This study aim assess degree hypoxia measure [ F-18 ] -FAZA-PET image correlate reference standard hypoxia confirm pimonidazole target immunohistochemistry use 3D whole-mount histopathologic approach . This pilot study form prospective , Phase II , single arm , trial investigate use IHC method validate functional medical image sub-tumour level . Ten patient biopsy confirm oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma surgery intend form definitive treatment approach participate study . Participants receive pre-study test standard care ( e.g . biopsy , complete blood count , serum electrolyte , urinalysis , liver function test , beta-hCG testing , etc . ) incremental test . Patients receive routine MRI CT . In addition receive [ F-18 ] -FAZA-PET scan 2-3 day prior surgery . Within 1 week surgery patient see pre-anaesthesia clinic repeat bloodwork routine peri-operative assessment . On day surgery , addition typical peri-operative activity ( e.g . 24 hour solid fast , consume clear fluid ) patient instruct take prescribe dose oral pimonidazole-HCl 16-20 hour surgery . The patient admit day surgery carry routine fashion , e.g . total removal tumour plus appropriate margin . For research purpose , specimen process differently routine pathology . Once specimen completely remove several external marker apply surface guide orientation . The specimen embed 3.5 % agar place ice 1 hour . The embedded specimen undergo MRI ( ex-vivo ) note position specimen block use external marker . The MRI single 5 minute T1 sequence . The specimen cut front back 3 mm slice stain pimonidazole show hypoxia well typical hematoxylin eosin stain use clinical pathologic assessment . Histology slide digitize laser scanner resolution 0.5µm/pixel . The gross tumour area macroscopic hypoxia define pathologist . The histology image reconstruct use external marker internal landmark well ex-vivo MRI match ( co-registered ) vivo FAZA-PET/CT/MRI tumour volume . Despite available high technical precision radiation treatment machine , limited clinical progress make last 15 year sub-volume ( i.e . less whole tumour ) target target uncertainty . With multidisciplinary , multi-institutional collaboration , group correlate FAZA-PET image 3D histological reference validate ( i.e . evaluate accuracy ) functional imaging unprecedented level . This invaluable understanding biological underpinnings commonly use functional imaging could help form basis future clinical trial .</detailed_description>
