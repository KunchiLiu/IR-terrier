	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , randomly assign ( flip coin ) 1 2 study group . This do one know one study group well , , bad group . You equal ( 1 2 ) chance assign either group : - If Group A , receive nivolumab every 2 week ( +/- 7 day ) total 4 dos surgery . After , receive nivolumab additional 6 month . - If Group B , receive nivolumab ( +/- 7 day ) ipilimumab every 3 week 3 dos surgery . After , receive nivolumab alone 6 month . You study staff know group assign . Study Drug Administration : If Group A , receive nivolumab vein 1 hour Days 1 , 15 , 29 , 43 . You surgery . After surgery , receive nivolumab vein every 2 week ( +/- 7 day ) 6 month ( 13 dos ) . If Group B , receive nivolumab vein 1 hour ipilimumab vein 90 minute Days 1 , 22 , 43 . You surgery . After surgery , receive nivolumab vein every 2 week ( +/- 7 day ) 6 month ( 13 dos ) . If treatment need delay two week safety reason , next dose ( ) skip . However , able begin treatment disease appear respond , remain study proceed surgery plan . Study Visits : Group A Before Surgery : On Day 1 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 3 ½ tablespoon ) draw routine test On Days 15 29 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 6 ½ tablespoon ) draw routine test test immune system . - You tumor biopsy biomarker test Day 15 . Biomarkers find blood tissue may relate reaction study drug . On Day 43 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 3 ½ tablespoon ) draw routine test On Day 57 : - You EKG . - You physical exam . - Blood ( 6 ½ tablespoon ) draw routine test test immune system . - You CT scan , PET-CT scan , MRI check status disease . If doctor think disease still remove surgery , surgery follow week . If disease longer able treated surgery , take study . Your doctor discus treatment option . - If become pregnant , blood ( 1/2 teaspoon ) urine collect pregnancy test . Group B Before Surgery : On Day 1 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 6 ½ tablespoon ) draw routine test test immune system . On Days 22 43 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 6 ½ tablespoon ) draw routine test test immune system . - You tumor biopsy biomarker test Day 22 . On Day 57 : - You EKG . - You physical exam . - Blood ( 6 ½ tablespoon ) draw routine test test immune system . - You CT scan , PET-CT scan , MRI check status disease . If doctor think disease still remove surgery , surgery follow week . If disease longer able treated surgery , take study . Your doctor discus treatment option . - If become pregnant , blood ( 1/2 teaspoon ) urine collect pregnancy test . Surgery ( All Participants ) : On Day 57 surgery remove disease . You sign surgery consent form describe procedure risk . Tissue collect time surgery research test remain melanoma cell check status disease . Study Visits After Surgery All Participants : Every 2 week recover surgery ( every time receive nivolumab ) : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 3 ½ tablespoon ) draw routine test . At follow visit additional test procedure perform : - At Weeks 10 , 22 , 34 surgery , blood ( 3 tablespoon ) also draw test immune system . - At Weeks 22 34 surgery , CT scan , PET-CT scan , MRI check status disease . Length Treatment : You may receive 13 dos nivolumab surgery . You longer able take study drug ( ) disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study follow-up visit . End-of-Treatment Visit : When stop receiving nivolumab , intolerable side effect , end-of-treatment visit . The following test procedure perform : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 6 ½ tablespoon ) draw routine test test immune system . - You CT scan , PET-CT scan , MRI check status disease . Follow-Up Visits : Every 12 week last dose drug ( ) : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 6 tablespoon ) draw routine test test immune system . - You CT scan , PET-CT scan , MRI check status disease . The study staff contact follow-up , 2 year surgery . You ask health status , anti-cancer therapy receive ( include radiation ) , disease may respond therapy . If need stop receive treatment early , study staff contact check health status every 3 month start new treatment melanoma . This follow-up contact may do in-person , continue treatment MD Anderson . If contact phone , email letter . This investigational study . Ipilimumab nivolumab FDA approve commercially available treat metastatic melanoma . It investigational give drug combination surgery . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 40 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Capable give write informed consent , include compliance requirement restriction list consent form 2 . Patients must histologically cytologically confirm Stage IIIB/C Stage IV oligometastatic melanoma . Oligometastatic melanoma define three few area resectable disease exclude central nervous system bone involvement . Patients cutaneous , mucosal , acral , ocular unknown primary melanoma eligible enrollment . For patient stage IV disease distant lymph node ( stage M1a ) , maximum three separate lymph node sit fit definition oligometastatic disease . Resectable tumor define significant vascular , neural bony involvement . Only case complete surgical resection tumorfree margin safely achieve defined resectable . 3 . Patients least one melanoma deposit undergo serial biopsy ( least 2 time point ) neoadjuvant phase protocol . Patients must willing provide tumor sample time point specify Study Procedure Tables . 4 . All patient must undergo baseline tumor biopsy PDL1 testing ( PDL1 positivity determine great equal 1 % cell stain membrane immunohistochemistry ) . For patient stage IV disease , site tumor biopsy preferably nonlymph node disease site . For PDL1 testing , biopsy contain sufficient tumor content ( &gt; /=100 tumor cells/4micron tissue section ) . If sample contains insufficient tumor content , rebiopsy require obtain sample sufficient tumor content prior treatment . 5 . Patients must medically fit enough undergo surgery determine treat medical surgical oncology team 6 . Patients previously treat adjuvant set melanoma ( include use prior interferon alpha , pegylated interferon vaccine clinical trial ) eligible treatment 28 day washout period 7 . Patients must measurable disease , define RECIST 1.1 8 . Age &gt; /= 18 year 9 . ECOG performance status 01 10 .

Men sexually active WOCBP must follow instruction birth control halflife investigational drug great 24 hour , contraception continue period 90 day plus time required investigational drug undergo five halflives . The halflife nivolumab ipilimumab 25 day 18 day , respectively . Therefore , men sexually active WOCBP must continue contraception 31 week ( 90 day plus time require nivolumab undergo five halflives ) last dose investigational drug . 15 .
