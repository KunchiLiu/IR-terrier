	<brief_summary>The purpose study explore way antidepressant concentration ( amount medication ) blood change due physiological change body ( i.e. , change metabolism , hormone body fluid ) pregnancy postpartum impact genetic factor degree change . Changes antidepressant concentration important monitor , decrease antidepressant concentration may lead less therapeutic drug level , may cause increase mood symptom recurrence depressive episode . Increases antidepressant concentration potential lead increase side effect . The study team hop good understand course change across pregnancy postpartum individual 's genetic makeup impact change goal develop guideline optimize antidepressant treatment pregnant woman .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The overarch goal NICHD-funded U54 Obstetric-Fetal Pharmacology Research Center study develop evidence construct guideline optimal use selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) antidepressant pregnant woman . The progressive change plasma SSRI metabolite concentration across pregnancy birth determine observational study . Serial evaluation depressive anxiety symptom side effect obtain evaluate association plasma concentration monthly interval pregnancy twice post-birth . To assess subject ' metabolic phenotype , subject option receive probe drug cocktail , give evaluate activity enzymes involve antidepressant metabolism third trimester ( activity change maximal ) compare non-pregnant state birth . Additionally , study team investigate impact genomic variability inter-individual difference SSRI dosing , plasma concentration pharmacodynamics pregnancy , focus gene involve metabolism elimination SSRIs , drug transporter responsible SSRI access central nervous system , gene encode critical SSRI target involve therapeutic efficacy . Finally , study team determine maternal-fetal plasma concentration pharmacogenetic characteristic associate neonatal SSRI abstinence syndrome . Maternal fetal genotype assess relationship SSRI drug concentration neonatal abstinence syndrome .</detailed_description>
