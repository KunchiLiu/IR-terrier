	<brief_title>A Clinical Trial Comparing Monocryl Dermabond Closure Versus Staple Closure Total Hip Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Wound closure always base surgeon preference type closure . Skin closure consider important part surgical procedure since often visible evidence surgical procedure . In fact , conclusion success surgery often base appearance wound . There study variety surgical journal look two pertinent method closure majority come obstetrical journal compare caesarian section closure staple versus subcuticular monocryl suture . For part , although patient satisfaction quite high initially subcuticular closure , long term follow-up patient satisfaction score quite similar . One study publish Journal Bone Joint Surgery recommend staple closure beneficial skin closure monocryl suture total hip knee arthroplasty . Their recommendation base overall shorter operative time use staple closure compare monocryl suture . They also find final patient satisfaction complication rate relatively similar 3 month postoperatively . This group publish earlier paper well describe use glue closure report decrease overall drainage rate analyze data subcuticular suture oppose staple . A recent study evaluate wound appearance 3 month use surgeon -rated visual analogue scale compare use adhesive tape versus staple skin closure follow total hip arthroplasty . Again , significant difference patient satisfaction score report . To date , paucity well-powered study compare outcomes patient whose wound close use usual staple method compare monocryl suture method . In addition , outcome focus surgeon-ratings patient rating . The proposal study compare overall patient surgeon-rated cosmetic scar appearance complication follow total hip replacement skin closure use monocryl suture versus staple . This study would use recent , validated assessment tool VAS scale . The assessment call Patient Observer Scar Assessment Scale ( POSAS ) incorporate six essential feature wound colour , malleability , etc . The form split surgeon rating carry weight final score patient assessment scar . This scale give nice balance determine overall satisfaction wound heal combine surgeon patient score .</detailed_description>
