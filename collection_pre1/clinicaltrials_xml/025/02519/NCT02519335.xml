	<brief_summary>Cardiopulmonary bypass arrest heart cardiac surgery necessary allow surgeon perform heart operation . However , process cause injury heart may worsen post-operative outcome . In fact , effect injury may continue surgery , lead long-term decrease heart function . Neonates young infant particular risk occurrence . While much research do adult look medicine might protect heart surgery , study conduct neonate young infant . The investigator test Dexrazoxane , proven cardio-protective pediatric cancer patient , hope may lessen cardiac injury congenital heart surgery , thereby improve outcome neonatal young infant population . In order accomplish , investigator must first determine Dexrazoxane safely administer young child congenital heart disease . Therefore , investigator perform pilot study 12 child ass : 1. Dexrazoxane 3 different dos metabolize body child age 0-6 month congenital heart surgery , 2. safety Dexrazoxane use neonatal young infant population undergo cardiac surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use Cardioprotectant Dexrazoxane During Congenital Heart Surgery : Proposal Pilot Investigation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neonates infant undergo heart surgery cardioplegic arrest experience inflammation myocardial ischemia-reperfusion [ IR ] injury . These process provoke myocardial apoptosis oxygen free radical formation result cardiac injury dysfunction . Dexrazoxane derivative EDTA approve prevention anthracycline-related cardiotoxicity . It provide cardioprotection reduction toxic reactive oxygen specie [ ROS ] , suppression apoptosis . The deleterious effect cardiopulmonary bypass [ CPB ] cardioplegic arrest heart congenital heart operation greatly influence postoperative morbidity mortality . Neonates infant undergo cardiac surgery experience systemic inflammatory response , myocardial IR injury cardioplegic arrest reverse . These process provoke elaboration cytokine activation complement cascade , well oxygen free radical formation induction myocardial apoptosis ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) . Frequently , myocardial injury cardiac dysfunction ensue , lead low cardiac output syndrome multi-system organ failure . The irreversible component injury , addition abnormal workload impose myocardium anatomic defect , may consequences long-term cardiac function , may part explain contractile dysfunction observe late congenital heart The investigator propose pilot pharmacokinetic/safety trial dexrazoxane child 0-6 month age , follow randomize , double-blind , clinical trial dexrazoxane v placebo congenital heart surgery . The investigator evaluate postoperative time resolution organ failure , development low cardiac output syndrome , length cardiac ICU hospital stay , echocardiographic index cardiac dysfunction . Results could establish safety clinical utility dexrazoxane ameliorate ischemia-reperfusion injury congenital heart surgery .</detailed_description>
