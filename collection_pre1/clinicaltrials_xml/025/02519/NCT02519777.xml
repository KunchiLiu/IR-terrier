	<detailed_description>HIV-infected people often cognitive dysfunction ( HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder , HAND ) , include asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment ( ANI ) , mild neurocognitive disorder ( MND ) , HIV-associated dementia ( HAD ) , even ART undetectable viral load . In study , researcher evaluate effectiveness add MVC DTG current ART regimen HIV-infected people undetectable ( &lt; 50 copies/mL ) plasma HIV-1 RNA mild moderate neurocognitive impairment stable ART least 6 month prior study entry . The purpose study evaluate addition MVC DTG participant ' exist ART regimen improve participant ' neurocognitive performance . Participants randomly assign one three arm . All participant remain exist ART regimens ; take assign study drug addition ART regimen . Participants Arm A receive placebo MVC placebo DTG . Participants Arm B receive DTG placebo MVC . Participants Arm C receive MVC DTG . Study visit occur entry Weeks 2 , 4 , 12 , 24 , 48 , 72 , 96 . Visits may include physical examination , blood collection , neurocognitive testing , questionnaire . Some participant may optional lumbar puncture procedure . Participants return refill study drug Weeks 36 , 60 , 84 . No evaluation perform visit .</detailed_description>
