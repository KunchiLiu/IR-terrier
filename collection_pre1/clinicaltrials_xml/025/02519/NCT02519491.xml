	<brief_summary>Accessing artery heart blood vessel wrist become increasingly popular . By obtain access via artery arm oppose groin , less risk complication improve patient satisfaction . However , use wrist cause blockage artery procedure . If little blood flow second artery supply hand , could result significant injury . Therefore , important test blood vessel wrist prior procedure . The best way evaluate artery involve use ultrasound take long time expensive . Therefore , artery usually evaluate clinical test know modify Allen 's test , relies doctor watch flush hand compression artery . Currently smart phone camera able assess blood flow pass light skin watch difference brightness . This may better way assess artery hand less subjective simply watch flush hand . This study aim assess ability iPhone application determine whether sufficient blood flow artery wrist compare clinical test commonly use .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Utility Smart Phone Application Assessing Radial Artery Patency - CAPITAL iRADIAL Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over past decade , transradial approach cardiac catheterization emerge preferred method angiography intervention . There several observational randomize controlled trial show association transradial access reduce risk bleed vascular complication , increase cost-effectiveness , improve patient satisfaction , mortality benefit high-risk patient population . However , technique carry risk complication include radial artery occlusion , non-occlusive radial artery injury , radial artery spasm , hand ischemia , pseudoaneurysm , radial artery perforation , nerve damage , arteriovenous fistulisation , bleed . Radial artery occlusion commonly note complication clinical impact unclear . In individual intact collateral palmar circulation ulnar artery , individual usually asymptomatic require intervention . However , individual lack adequate collateral circulation , individual risk hand ischemia loss tissue function necessitate surgical intervention , ultimately , amputation . Thus , common practice ass competency collateral palmar circulation prior transradial cardiac catheterization mitigate risk associate approach . The gold standard assessment radial artery patency colour Doppler ultrasound image artery . This gold standard allow direct , objective assessment arterial patency competency direct visualization blood flow . The use pre-procedural ultrasound remain labour resource intensive hence feasible practical use , therefore physician must rely clinical assessment collateral circulation . This traditionally evaluate use modify Allen 's test ( MAT ) , technique perform bedside part pre-procedural physical examination . More recently , introduction plethysmography pulse oximetry utilize theoretically provide objective measure assess collateral circulation , though limited available resource . Given ever increase prevalence smart phone , study aim address utility feasibility iPhone application determine adequacy collateral palmar circulation . Should iPhone application provide superior diagnostic accuracy , could quickly become alternative method provide objective measure collateral palmar circulation rather rely subjective MAT .</detailed_description>
