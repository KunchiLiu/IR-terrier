	<brief_summary>Laparoscopic Robotic assist hysterectomy surgical procedure minimally invasive way remove uterus , less scar few complication . However , procedure , much like open-surgical counterpart , often associate significant post-operative pain . To augment pain many different analgesic technique available offset pain . Ultrasound-guided transversus abdominis plane ( TAP ) block one procedure involve injection local anesthetic plane transversus abdominal muscle terminal branch nerve lie . A similar , yet different analgesic approach direct injection local anesthetic incision surgeon surgical procedure . These two approach proven decrease post-operative pain patient many procedure , never compare one another .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TAP vs Surgical Infiltration Local Anesthetic Laparoscopic Robotic Hysterectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This double blind randomize study . All patient receive one form local anesthetic pain relief either TAP infiltration . Patients randomize one two study arm double-blinded , placebo control study . All patient receive TAP infiltration patient receive infiltration incision . In one arm TAP infiltration contain 10 mL 0.25 % bupivacaine epinephrine inject follow 20 mL 50:50 mixture liposomal bupivacaine normal saline . This repeated contralateral side . In arm surgeon infiltration incision consist 10 ml normal saline per port site , 5 ml prior incision 5 ml prior closure port site . In second arm bilateral TAP infiltration consist 30 mL normal saline per side . In arm surgeon infiltration consist 10 mL 0.25 % bupivacaine per port site . The surgeon infiltration consist 5 ml 0.25 % bupivacaine prior incision 5 ml 0.25 % bupivacaine prior closure port site . A TAP infiltration injection local anesthetic cover transversus abdominis muscle layer provide effective post operative analgesia.2-5 This layer find use ultrasound , beam high frequency sound allow one visualize image body . Then use ultrasound investigator see needle pierce cover transversus abdominis muscle layer watch local anesthetic infiltrate plane . This do side abdomen provide analgesia skin , muscle , facial layer abdomen . This currently standard care institution perform within one hour surgical incision . The injection consist 10 mL 0.25 % bupivacaine epinephrine follow 20 mL liposomal bupivacaine saline mixture 10 ml saline follow 20 ml saline repeat contralateral side . Surgical Infiltration study solution perform prior incision end surgery prior closure incision . At time , surgeon inject 5 mL 0.25 % bupivacaine port site incision . Investigational Drug Service ( IDS ) pharmacy charge blind medication vs. saline procedure . Following procedure , individual receive schedule acetaminophen ( 1 gram every 6 hour ) , schedule ibuprofen ( 800 mg every 8 hour ) , PRN oxycodone 5-10mg q4h pain rat 5 10 numerical pain scale .</detailed_description>
