	<brief_title>Wearable Lower Extremity Exoskeleton Promote Walking Persons With Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Loss ability walk one significant problem person multiple sclerosis ( MS ) . This limitation prevent person active meaningful life home community . Also , energy need walk , cause fatigue lead non-active life style poor quality life . Unfortunately , walk train often available population severity progress disease ; therefore , new strategy need help people MS walk . A new technology , wearable robotic exoskeleton , develop help person spinal cord injury stand walk . The robotic leg power battery control motor . This study investigate use wearable robotic exoskeleton help person MS walk . Participants receive training ( 5 day per week 3 week ) walk robotic exoskeleton ( EKSO , EKSO Bionics , Richmond , CA ) . During training , physical therapist teach participant maintain balance , sit stand , stand sit , walk wearable robotic exoskeleton . The hypothesis person MS able use robotic exoskeleton walk good less energy cost .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects enrol meet follow inclusion criterion : Age 18 year old Ambulatory assistive device ( Ambulation status determine EDSS score ) With Expanded Disability Status Scale ( EDSS ) score 6 7.5 inclusive Height weight 160 188 cm ( 5 ' 2 '' 6 ' 2 '' ) , less 100 kg ( 220 lb ) , respectively ( per exoskeleton manufacturer ) Able follow simple 3 step commends Able understand study procedure consent form Subjects exclude follow exclusion criterion : History severe neurologic injury MS ( Spinal Cord Injury , Cerebral Palsy , Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis , Traumatic Brain Injury , Cerebral Vascular Accident , etc . ) Severe comorbidities : active infection heart , lung , circulatory condition pressure ulcer Documented severe osteoporosis affect hip spine Severe spasticity low extremity ( Modified Ashworth â‰¥ 3 ) uncontrolled clonus Unhealed limb pelvic fracture Skin issue would prevent wear device Range motion restriction would prevent subject achieve normal , reciprocal gait pattern , would restrict subject complete normal sit stand stand sit transition . Upper extremity strength deficit limit ability balance front roll walker crutch . Heterotopic ossification resist functional range motion low extremity Contractures ( &gt; 15 degree hip &gt; 20 degree knee ) Psychiatric cognitive comorbidities result motor planning impulsivity concern Colostomy Have receive physical therapy intervention within 3 month prior enrolment study NonEnglish speaking</criteria>
