	<brief_summary>Phantom limb pain ( PLP ) frequent consequence amputation , notoriously difficult treat . Amputation usually follow traumatic injury surgery follow vascular disease , diabetes , osteomyelitis tumour case loss limb require survival patient . The loss limb body part usually follow sensation lose body part still present felt . These phenomenon call , respectively , phantom awareness phantom sensation . In 50-80 % amputee neuropathic pain develop lose limb also refer phantom limb pain ( PLP ) . PLP relate certain position movement phantom limb , might elicit worsened range physical factor ( e.g . change weather pressure residual limb ) psychological factor ( e.g . emotional stress ) . It well known treatment available PLP today , pharmacological , surgical , anaesthetic , psychological , ineffective . Today believe phantom limb pain may relate change cortex brain . There evidence change may modulate - even reverse - provide sensory input stump amputation zone . For example , cortical reorganization alleviation phantom limb pain observe amputee follow intense use hand prosthesis . However , consistent knowledge type peripheral sensory feedback may effective affect cortical plasticity best apply sensory feedback . The aim propose research create natural , meaningful sensation provide non-invasive sensory feedback ( i.e . surface electrical stimulation ) effectiveness alleviate phantom limb pain restore cortical neuroplastic change .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Purpose Study . Up 50-80 % person amputation experience pain part body miss . This phenomenon call phantom limb pain ( PLP ) . It clear today phantom limb pain occur , since pain difficult treat , affect quality life . Other scientific study show use electrical stimulation apply surface electrode assist decrease alleviate phantom limb pain . The aim study investigate daily electrical stimulation period 30 day decrease alleviate PLP . Methods : This study conduct follow phase : 1 . Pre-screening 2 . Baseline 3 . Entry 4 . Pre-Therapy 5 . Therapy 6 . Outcome 7 . Follow-up Procedures phase 1 7 standardize across international EPIONE partner ( carry different intervention , similar assessment ) , enable comparison treatment modality . During different phase study collection assessment method conduct monitor effect stimulation therapy amputee 's level perceive PLP cortical organization . In addition , psychological state subject , strength type non-painful phantom limb sensation also assess provide detailed view possible effect stimulation therapy . The experiment conduct series case study effect stimulation therapy subject compare PLP sensation subject perceived initiate therapy . Therefore , amputee stable state ( e.g. , newly amputate subject ) include study . No placebo blind perform amputee feel stimulation also mentally actively involved perform `` phantom limb movement '' receive stimulation therapy . Phases 1-7 subject ( week -3 week 12 , week = 0 pre-therapy ) perform accord experiment protocol define collaboration international partner . Phase 1 : Pre-screening . The pre-screen phase aim assess candidate subject degree duration pain , intelligence psychological state test measure inclusion criterion . The assessment protocol administer per subject prior enrollment study . Phase 2 : Baseline . The baseline phase aim determine stability intra-subject variability pain sensation without treatment . These measure control daily variability pain , assessment score variability , site site variability intra subject variability `` intervention '' state . These variance use analysis estimate baseline noise measure measurement uncertainty statistical effect test . Phase 3 : Entry . Entry assessment determine entry assessment measure untreated case . They divide two protocol . All subject receive assessment protocol . Protocol 1 include set self-report measure pain sensation . Protocol 2 include application cortical mapping method use fMRI . The self-report measure MAP ( map phantom pain perception non-painful phantom sensation ) VAS ( Visual Analogue Scale ) include provide continuous longitudinal application instrument throughout protocol . Phase 4 : Pre-therapy . This phase consist one visit set stimulus range subject . Phase 5 : Therapy . Treatment provide daily basis four ( 4 ) week . VAS MAP administer therapy capture immediate transient effect therapy . Phase 6 : Outcome . This phase consist subjective objective measure define end state subject immediately follow course therapy . These outcome test Entry measure determine degree effect treatment PLP sensation . Outcome 1 ( N week 8 ) carry follow last therapy day Outcome 2 one week later . Phase 7 : Follow-up . Follow-up assessed week N+2 , N+4 N+8 ( 2 , 4 8 week last therapy day ) case . Most sensory feedback treatment carry time course , effect carry beyond end treatment . This phase assess time course . Subjects ask complete questionnaire answer question ask . Data collect write questionnaire verbal communication sensation pain either person telephone .</detailed_description>
