	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine effectiveness helmet-less tackle training ( HuTT Technique ) intervention reduce head impact high school football player gain understanding neurocognitive effect repetitive head impact football . The investigator hypothesis HuTT Technique result reduce frequency magnitude helmet impact control group measure head impact measurement system . Also , investigator hypothesize HuTT Technique group demonstrate less change neurocognitive score mid post season evaluation compare control group . Head impact measure use SIM-G impact monitor make Triax Technology . The SIM-G impact monitor measure location , magnitude , direction every head impact real time store protect cloud-based system . The sensor worn athlete headband skullcap . Neurocognitive function measure use Immediate Post-concussion Assessment Cognitive Testing ( ImPACT ) test . The test use tool determine baseline neurocognitive function use comparison athlete injured ensure he/she return baseline . ImPACT measure memory ( verbal , visual , work ) , process speed reaction time use variety test . Subjects recruit local high school football team include freshman , sophomores junior . Since study expect run 2 year , senior eligible participation . The target recruit least 150 total subject . All subject equip new helmet fit head headband use hold head impact telemetry sensor . In addition , subject take ImPACT test preseason , midseason postseason . At conclusion season , impact SIM-G impact monitor system ImPACT test score analyze . The relevant outcome measure analyze include head impact frequency , location , magnitude , symptom score , memory , visual motor speed reaction time composite score . Statistical analysis use determine HuTT intervention minimize head impact neurocognitive decline compare control group .</brief_summary>
