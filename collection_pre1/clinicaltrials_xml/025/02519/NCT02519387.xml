	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Buprenorphine Transdermal Patch Non-cancer Pain Moderate Intensity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Buprenorphine transdermal ( BTDs ) semi-synthetic opioid analgesic . Earlier study show BTDs non-inferior oral codeine-paracetamol combination prolonged-release tramadol , term pain control well sleep quality . BTDs register use Malaysia scientific data efficacy tolerability among Malaysians available . Thus , study conduct evaluate efficacy tolerability BTDs among Malaysian patient . Patients eligible entry study adult age ≥ 40 year meet inclusion criterion qualify baseline screen liver function test ( LFT ) assessment . The study exclude patient meet exclusion criterion fail prior LFT assessment . Patients receive initial dose 5 mg BTDs qualify baseline screen LFT test . The dose could up-titrated maximum BTDs 20mg ( 2 X 10 mg ) achieve stable pain control . There six visit three-month study period . At visit 1 , patient receive 5mg Sovenor® initial treatment dose . Visit 2 occur 7 day first visit ; visit 2 visit 3 dose titration visit . Visit 4 visit 5 , assessment purpose . Primary treatment efficacy measure visit additional assessment patient ' sleep quality quality life , physician ' patient ' treatment satisfaction assess final visit . Safety measure monitor occurrence adverse event ( AEs ) .</detailed_description>
