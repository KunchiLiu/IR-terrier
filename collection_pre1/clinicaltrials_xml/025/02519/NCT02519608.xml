	<brief_summary>This investigator-initiated , prospective , single-centre , randomise , phase II , open-label study , test superiority ticagrelor , compare clopidogrel , modulate on-P2Y12 treatment platelet reactivity , endothelial dysfunction inflammation chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) patient receive schedule percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) stable coronary artery disease . Subjects meet inclusion criterion provide informed consent randomly assign 1:1 fashion one two dual antiplatelet therapy ( DAPT ) regimen : aspirin + clopidogrel ( standard care ) vs. aspirin + ticagrelor ( experimental arm ) . DAPT aspirin clopidogrel least 6 month ( preferably 12 month ) current gold-standard patient receive PCI drug elute stent implantation SCAD . No data support different strategy and/or approach COPD patient undergo PCI . Ticagrelor , new P2Y12 inhibitor , show significantly high platelet inhibition compare clopidogrel . Recently , ticagrelor administration associate positive effect endothelial function modulation proinflammatory signal . These action mediate significant influence adenosine uptake . Higher platelet reactivity , chronic inflammatory response , heighten endothelial dysfunction characterize COPD patient concomitant coronary artery disease ( CAD ) . The investigator speculate COPD patient undergo PCI stable CAD ( SCAD ) risk profile similar acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) patient . Accordingly , COPD patient undergo PCI SCAD may obtain strong benefit ticagrelor compare clopidogrel . The aim study evaluate whether ticagrelor , superior clopidogrel , reduce endothelial dysfunction , platelet reactivity ( PR ) inflammation profile patient stable CAD COPD . Ticagrelor administer accord PLATO trial international guideline ( 180 mg load dose , 90 mg x 2 daily maintenance dose ) . As suggested international guideline , control group patient current gold standard treatment SCAD treat PCI ( aspirin + clopidogrel 75 mg daily ) . The evaluation endothelial dysfunction , PR inflammation profile repeat 30 day compare baseline value .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Epidemiology Ischemic heart disease ( IHD ) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) respectively first fourth cause death industrialized country account 10-15 % total disability adjust life year ( DALY ) . COPD common IHD patient , range 5 % 18 % , high prevalence diagnosis ( 87 % ) . At time , one third COPD patient ' death attributable IHD every 10 % decrease forced expiratory volume one second ( FEV1 ) , cardiovascular ( CV ) mortality rise 28 % . - Prognostic implication IHD-COPD comorbidity Presence concomitant COPD IHD negative impact quality life , disease progression short long-term outcome . After coronary revascularization patient COPD high risk recurrent myocardial infarction ( MI ) , heart failure ( HF ) bleed complication compare patient without COPD . Consequently , COPD independent predictor mortality MI patient ( HR 1.4 ; 95 % CI 1.2-1.6 ) . In retrospective study , include patient undergo percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) 4-years follow-up , COPD independent risk factor all-cause mortality ( odds ratio [ OR ] , 1.79 ; 95 % CI , 1.63-1.96 ) , cardiac mortality ( OR 1.57 ; 95 % CI , 1.35-1.81 ) , occurrence MI ( OR 1.3 ; 95 % CI , 1.14-1.47 ) . Another prospective study 5000 consecutive patient coronary artery disease ( CAD ) evaluate in-hospital period PCI . Patients COPD experience significantly high incidence angina ( p &lt; 0.001 ) , arrhythmia ( p &lt; 0.001 ) , composite major adverse cardiac event ( p &lt; 0.001 ) long hospital stay ( p &lt; 0.001 ) patient without COPD . The analysis Charlson index stable CAD patient confirm presence COPD strongly relate long-term survival . - Inflammation , hypoxia endothelial dysfunction COPD characterize state chronic inflammation airway vessel . Interleukin-6 , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) fibrinogen often elevate COPD facilitate endothelial dysfunction atherosclerosis progression . Fibrinogen induce plaque grow , stimulate platelet white blood cell adhesion vessel wall promotes muscle cell proliferation migration . Higher plasma level fibrinogen directly relate high risk acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) . CRP facilitate production interleukin promote inflammatory state . Chronic hypoxia , contribute endothelial dysfunction increase arterial stiffness , trigger , vulnerable subject , growth destabilization atherosclerotic plaque . - Platelet reactivity Heightened on-treatment PR well-known determinant poor prognosis PCI patient significantly high COPD patient . In COPD patient , platelet ' count tent higher , thrombocytosis associate increase 1-year mortality ( OR 1.53 ; 95 % CI 1.03 2.29 , p=0.03 ) . - Ticagrelor Ticagrelor direct-acting reversely bind inhibitor P2Y12 platelet ' receptor . Dual antiplatelet therapy ( DAPT ) aspirin plus ticagrelor , compare aspirin plus clopidogrel , significantly reduce rate CV death , myocardial infarction , and/or stroke . Accordingly , DAPT ticagrelor guideline 's recommend treatment ( class I ) patient ACS . On contrary , DAPT ticagrelor stable CAD patient recommend . Dyspnea well-established ticagrelor potential side effect could relate circulate increased adenosine level ticagrelor administration . A recent study Alexopoulos et al . report COPD major determinant poor/absent prescription ticagrelor . Of note , Butler et al . demonstrate ticagrelor administration alter pulmonary function rest exercise patient COPD . Furthermore , ticagrelor-induced high adenosine concentration consider main mechanism `` pleiotropic '' effect ( prevention ADP-induced contraction vascular smooth muscle cell , improvement peripheral endothelial function increase endothelial nitric oxide synthase phosphorylation , reduction pro-inflammatory thrombin-induced cytokine chemokine 's production inflammation coagulation activation ) . - Research hypothesis Rationale conducting study : Many study show patient COPD undergo PCI stent implantation high risk adverse event ( death , MI stent thrombosis , ST ) . This true patient ACS stable coronary artery disease ( SCAD ) . Many factor may explain find . First , COPD patient higher on-treatment ( aspirin clopidogrel ) platelet reactivity ( PR ) . Second , inflammation profile significantly enhance COPD , contribute high PR endothelial dysfunction . Third , endothelial dysfunction due hypoxia , abnormal shear stress inflammation common COPD may explain increase acute event stent implantation . Patients receive PCI stent implantation must treat DAPT minimize risk ST recurrent MI . According current guideline , DAPT start soon possible patient ACS time PCI patient SCAD . Current guideline recommend association aspirin new P2Y12 inhibitor ( ticagrelor prasugrel ) ACS patient , whereas aspirin clopidogrel SCAD patient . No data support different strategy and/or approach COPD patient undergo PCI . Ticagrelor , new P2Y12 inhibitor , show significantly high platelet inhibition compare clopidogrel . Recently , ticagrelor administration associate positive effect endothelial function modulation proinflammatory signal . These action mediate significant influence adenosine uptake . These finding support possible positive effect ticagrelor COPD patient undergo PCI SCAD . Due comorbidity , COPD patient undergo PCI SCAD may consider similar ACS patient ( high platelet reactivity , chronic inflammatory response , heighten endothelial dysfunction ) . Accordingly , COPD patient undergo PCI SCAD may obtain strong benefit ticagrelor compare clopidogrel . The aim study evaluate whether ticagrelor superior clopidogrel reduce endothelial dysfunction , PR inflammation profile patient stable CAD COPD .</detailed_description>
