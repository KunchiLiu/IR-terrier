	<brief_title>A Prospective Household Observational Cohort Study Influenza , Respiratory Syncytial Virus Other Respiratory Pathogens Community Burden Transmission Dynamics South Africa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Information community burden influenza essential inform control , routinely collect . For example , influenza transmission model , widely use inform efficacy cost-effectiveness vaccine , antiviral non-pharmaceutical countermeasure , depend valid epidemiological estimate community occurrence transmission disease . While community level study Flu Watch cohort study United Kingdom implement recent year high-income country , community burden influenza remain largely unknown lower- middle-income country , especially Africa burden influenza may higher . In addition , data exist household transmission dynamic influenza virus . Such data could provide important insight inform target intervention , instance , maximize indirect effect influenza vaccination protect vulnerable group available influenza vaccine currently license efficacy low ( e.g . child &lt; 2 year age ) . Human respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) major cause childhood acute low respiratory tract infection , especially among infant &lt; 3 month age . While RSV vaccine currently available , efficacy promise RSV candidate vaccine evaluate . Alternative strategy RSV vaccination propose , include vaccination old age group indirectly protect vulnerable infant reduce circulation virus population prevent chain transmission infant . Nonetheless , evaluate effect knowledge RSV burden , transmission dynamic source infection infant community need . Pneumococcus lead bacterial cause pneumonia . The pneumcoccal conjugate vaccine ( PCV ) introduce expand programme immunisation 2009 . Data carriage prevalence , dynamic carriage interaction respiratory pathogen helpful guide intervention target pneumococcal disease prevent vaccination . Both diphtheria pertussis identify emerge pathogen South Africa recent year , give rise outbreak 2014 2015 year low prevalence . Meningococcus epidemic-prone disease cause cyclical outbreak South Africa little known carriage prevalence South Africa . Annual incidence tuberculosis Southern Africa high globally , Swaziland , Lesotho South Africa high rate tuberculosis world . Moreover , South Africa tuberculosis lead cause death death notification form , HIV-infected individual ( yet receive antiretrovirals whilst take antiretrovirals ) , lead serious opportunistic infection . Data carriage prevalence and/or transmission dynamic pathogens important guide control measure , include target vaccination strategy . Prevention effort limit transmission household often recommend data household transmission impact HIV infection limit date . Objectives Primary - To estimate community burden influenza RSV , include : ( ) incidence influenza RSV infection community ; ( ii ) symptomatic fraction associate influenza RSV infection ; ( iii ) severity associate symptomatic infection ; ( iv ) fraction individual symptomatic infection seek medical care . - To assess transmission dynamic influenza RSV infection community , include : ( ) estimation household secondary infection risk ( SIR ) , serial interval length shed ; ( ii ) estimation transmission infection age group within household possibly community ; ( iii ) estimation effective reproductive number ( Rt ) variation time community . Secondary ( select ) - To estimate symptomatic fraction , severity associate symptomatic infection fraction individual symptomatic infection seek medical care among influenza RSV positive case HIV serostatus age . - To estimate SIR length shed influenza RSV among HIV-infected HIV-uninfected index case rate acquisition influenza RSV infection among HIV-infected HIV-uninfected household member . - To assess role asymptomatic infection household transmission influenza RSV . - Determine heterogeneity influenza RSV virus strain within household cluster describe viral evolution within household well association virus strain duration virus shed HIV status - To describe compare nasopharyngeal pneumococcal load healthy individual age time , load may alter respiratory viral infection , HIV-status vaccination-status - To identify prevalence duration B. pertussis colonization within community age group , vaccine status time , transmission dynamic within household , proportion individual develop symptomatic infection - To determine prevalence N. meningitidis C. diphtheria colonization within community age group single point time year - To measure annual incidence tuberculosis infection individual live study household assess risk factor ( include incident prevalent HIV ) acquire tuberculosis infection . - To ascertain impact housing quality , fuel use indoor air quality select measure ventilation tuberculosis infection household transmission respiratory virus bacteria Methods : We conduct household-level community cohort study rural community Mpumalanga Province health demographic surveillance ( HDSS ) conduct ( Agincourt HDSS surveillance site ) select urban area Matlosana Muncipality North West Province . Prospective , hospital-based surveillance influenza- RSV-associated severe acute respiratory illness conduct site since 2010 . The prospective cohort study conduct 3 consecutive year , 2016-2018 , include 3 consecutive RSV influenza season . Approximately one hundred household ( 50 household per site , expect average number household member 5 recruit total 500 enrolled individual ) randomly select within study population year consent participate study . For household member , serum collect quarterly ( January-February , April-May , September-October November-December ) include RSV ( February May ) influenza ( May September ) season final blood draw end year . The demographic characteristic household member collect enrollment . Starting RSV influenza season , upper respiratory tract sample collect twice-a-week trained study nurse household member irrespective presence respiratory symptom throughout year . During visit development symptom ( use severity score ) healthcare seek behavior symptomatic case record . In addition , winter one household visit , oropharyngeal swab collect individual testing meningococcus diphtheria . Nasopharyngeal sample test detection RSV influenza virus pneumococcus B. pertussis infection real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( rt-PCR ) . Blood sample test rise RSV , influenza pertussis antibody titer . From consent patient , blood sample test HIV infection . For tuberculosis infection , tuberculin skin test ( TST ) baseline end first year annually thereafter people find TST negative previous test . HIV test offer participant baseline six monthly thereafter . All participant sputum sample take culture baseline thereafter symptom screen symptom tuberculosis monthly , investigate Xpert Mtuberculosis/Rif symptom tuberculosis present . The sample size approximately 1500 individual 3 consecutive season allow estimation 20 % risk infection 10 % risk illness 95 % CI 5 % desire absolute precision community . Individuals household enrol first second year study single follow-up visit towards end 2nd 3rd year study ( October ) . At visit blood specimen test HIV infection , influenza RSV serology collect TST test individual find TST negative previous test perform . Impact : This study improve understand community burden influenza , RSV , pertussis , tuberculosis pneumococcal infection South Africa . It also provide data carriage prevalence meningococcus diphtheria . The data generate study also provide important information transmission dynamic influenza , RSV , pertussis pneumococcus community allow good strategize intervention ( include target vaccination strategy ) evaluate potential impact . Moreover , absence prospective data tuberculosis infection high tuberculosis burden country . The data generate inform modelling transmission , sample size prevention study surveillance assess impact National Tuberculosis Control Program .</detailed_description>
