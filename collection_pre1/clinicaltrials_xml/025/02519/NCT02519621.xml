	<brief_summary>This study design assess efficacy economics two NPWT brand device wound heal outcomes . It also design assess effectiveness negative pressure negative pressure continuous irrigation multiple parameter wound heal . It single-center , open-label , active control , parallel-group trial aim determine efficacy Quantum simultaneous irrigation treatment diabetic foot ulcer . Specifically , eligible participant randomize receive either PRO negative press therapy simultaneous irrigation ; PRO negative pressure therapy without irrigation ; KCI Ulta negative pressure therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>To Compare Efficacy NPWT PRO Versus KCI Ulta® NPWT Compare NPWT PRO Versus NPWT PRO With Simultaneous Irrigation Wound Healing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects take operate room initial debridement procedure wound . At end procedure , subject continue meet inclusion exclusion criterion randomize 1:1:1 ratio treat either PRO , PRO simultaneous irrigation ( PROI ) , KCI Ulta NPWT . Prior study initiation seal pre-numbered randomization envelope provide research staff use obtain randomization assignment . Opening randomization envelop occur intraoperatively conclusion initial surgical debridement wound conformation eligibility requirement . Study staff use randomization number label contain envelop . The number become subject ID . The assignment subject randomize PRO , PRO simultaneous irrigation , KCI Ulta NPWT . The research staff note treatment assignment intra operative randomization CRF instruct investigator . Treatment therapy wound dressing apply operate room patient 's room immediately surgery per investigator discretion , accord manufacturer 's recommendation . In order ensure consistent study treatment , subject receive assign treatment therapy within study arm initial subsequent surgical debridement wound deem ready closure coverage Investigator . Subjects randomized PRO simultaneous irrigation Treatment arm subject receive irrigation therapy time study period . If irrigation therapy discontinue , subject Treatment arm transition PRO NPWT without irrigation . Subjects randomized PRO Control arm receive NPWT PRO therapy unit .</detailed_description>
