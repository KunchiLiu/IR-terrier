	<brief_summary>This study hop determine negative pressure dress superior traditional dress speed fistula closure laparotomy . This study broad variety implication . Patient safety paramount concern : Investigators hope identify superior method wound management minimizes risk skin breakdown , sepsis , morbidity . In addition , patient satisfaction would improve method faster wound heal . Finally , implication exist realm cost-benefit analysis , example , although VAC method costly , may save money speed heal prevents need reoperation . Alternatively , VAC method show beneficial , physician avoid use costly device proven benefit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Role VAC Therapy Devices Promoting Closure Enterocutaneous Fistulae</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Investigators plan superiority trial show VAC use speed closure enterocutaneous fistula routine gravity drainage . The investigator ' design randomize control trial two arm . One arm ( non-VAC ) include patient assigned system ECFoutput management involve negative pressure ( example , ostomy bag place fistula , wet dry dressing change , etc.. ) , second arm ( VAC ) consist group patient assign VAC negative pressure therapy regular sponge irrigation normal saline ( V.A.C.Ultaâ„¢ Negative Pressure Wound Therapy System ) . The fistula vac make standard sponge supply negative pressure suction device . Initial placement bedside physician intensive care unit , ward , clinic . The patient taught basic wound care , typical outpatient wound VACs , home nursing aide arrange . Those randomized VAC therapy ostomy bag wet dry dressing place skin negative pressure apply . Again , initial application perform bedside physician wound care nurse . The patient taught wound care , assistance provide necessary . Once fistula note closed ( effluent = 0cc/day ) dressing VAC discontinue , date fistula closure note .</detailed_description>
