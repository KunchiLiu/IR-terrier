	<brief_summary>High blood pressure , also refer hypertension , affect 65 million people United States alone . Approximately 25 percent people hypertension control high blood pressure , despite use multiple medication . Recently , new evidence demonstrate carotid body ( CB ) play role essential refractory hypertension , possibly due deregulate , enhanced activity organ . Animal study show CB de-afferentiation , carotid sinus nerve denervation , lead long-term stable drop blood pressure spontaneously hypertensive rat . De-afferentiation may perform either inject local anesthetic electrical stimulation . Both technique daily use operating theater anesthetize nerve wide range surgical procedure . We hypothesize block CB local anesthetic result drop blood pressure refractory hypertensive patient . We also want test idea stimulate CB electrical current mislead CB also result drop blood pressure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>High blood pressure , also refer hypertension , affect 65 million people United States alone . Approximately 25 percent people hypertension control high blood pressure , despite use multiple medication . Recently , new evidence demonstrate carotid body ( CB ) play role essential refractory hypertension , possibly due deregulate , enhanced activity organ . Animal study show CB de-afferentiation , carotid sinus nerve denervation , lead long-term stable drop blood pressure spontaneously hypertensive rat . It show hypertonicity CB lead sympathetic hyper-excitation SH rat cause increase vasomotor tone , turn contributes hypertension . The increase knowledge role CB essential hypertension lead development implantable ( via open surgery ) pulse generator , lead significant decrease blood pressure 12 month . One-year result 13 patient show 39 mmHg average decrease systolic blood pressure 26 mmHg average decrease diastolic blood pressure early report . Beside , procedure invasive require surgery general anesthesia . De-afferentiation may perform either inject local anesthetic electrical stimulation . Both technique daily use operating theater anesthetize nerve wide range surgical procedure . We hypothesize block CB local anesthetic result drop blood pressure refractory hypertensive patient . We also want test idea stimulate CB electrical current mislead CB also result drop blood pressure . Preliminary result shed light mechanism action CB refractory hypertension open way new therapeutical approach development new implantable device transcutaneous approach .</detailed_description>
