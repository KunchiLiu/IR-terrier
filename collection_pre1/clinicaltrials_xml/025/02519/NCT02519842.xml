	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate efficacy safety fosaprepitant ( MK-0517 ) plus ondansetron versus ondansetron alone prevention chemotherapy-induced nausea vomiting ( CINV ) pediatric participant schedule receive chemotherapeutic agent ( ) associate moderate high risk cause emesis ( vomit ) , chemotherapy agent ( ) previously tolerate due vomiting . The primary hypothesis single dose fosaprepitant combination ondansetron provide superior control CINV compare ondansetron alone measure percentage participant Complete Response ( vomit , retch , use rescue medication ) delay phase ( &gt; 24 120 hour ) follow initiation emetogneic chemotherapy Cycle 1 .</brief_summary>
