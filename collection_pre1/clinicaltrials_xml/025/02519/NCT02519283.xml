	<brief_summary>Approximately 20-30 % patient present acute heart failure discharge ED . Compared patient discharge hospital , frequently return ED hospital management . While inpatient discharge often enrol transition program care tailor evidence-based recommendation , ED discharge . The investigator propose evaluate current standard ED discharge ED-based intervention transition patient outpatient follow-up guideline-recommended therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Heart failure ( HF ) common grow healthcare concern . Heart failure affect nearly 6 million Americans . It result one million annual hospital discharge primary discharge diagnosis additional two million hospitalization HF contribute discharge diagnosis . Despite relative reduction hospitalization rate HF , actual number HF hospitalization remain one million annually . This figure expect significantly worsen age United States population grow HF prevalence . Over 80 % patient hospitalize initially see emergency department ( ED ) . However , see ED HF admit ; sizeable proportion discharge home without hospitalization . As disposition decision present hospital rest largely ED provider , ED play even big role management HF patient avoid unnecessary hospitalization . The ED gatekeeper AHF evaluation . Nearly one million ED visit acute heart failure ( AHF ) occur annually United States . Importantly , ED safety net AHF care often sole provider AHF care vulnerable patient . To optimize care reduce ED hospital revisits , significant emphasis improve transition time hospital discharge HF patient . Such effort almost exclusively directed hospitalized patient ; individual AHF discharge ED miss benefit transitional care initiative . Ensuring optimal transition care discharge ED AHF patient critical unmet need . Data show AHF patient discharge ED receive suboptimal guideline direct medical therapy ( GDMT ) , suggest intervention improve AHF transition need ED set . This particularly true patient resource limited setting , many vulnerable characteristic . By default ED often sole primary provider HF care group patient discharge ED . The proposal , `` Get Guidelines ED Patients Heart Failure ( GUIDED-HF ) '' , design answer two fundamental question vulnerable patient AHF discharge ED : 1 . Does GWTG : HF implementation transition nurse coordinator direct team ( TNC Team ) reduce disparity time ED/clinic revisit hospital admission cardiovascular death 3-month period immediately follow index ED visit ? 2 . Does GWTG : HF implementation TNC Team reduce disparity patient satisfaction , HF knowledge QOL 3-month period immediately follow index ED visit ? Patients hospitalize HF continue high risk adverse post-discharge outcome . Although relative reduction rehospitalization mortality rate AHF patient post-discharge significant recent effort hospital avoid CMS financial penalty , absolute risk remain high . The one-month post discharge readmission risk 20-25 % one-year post discharge mortality 25-30 % . These result institution implement significant in-hospital case management program specific focus transition care , include early post-discharge follow-up . ED patient discharge AHF vulnerable characteristic , high risk readmission , include hospital program target help . This proposal study significant unmet need , project get worse , evidence base data currently exist guide management . Even modest reduction risk ED revisit hospital admission potential significant clinical patient centric benefit patient AHF discharge ED .</detailed_description>
