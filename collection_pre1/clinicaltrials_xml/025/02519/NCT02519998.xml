	<detailed_description>Concussions comprise type mild traumatic brain injury mechanical force disrupt brain metabolism cause transient neurological symptom . At current time , universally agreed-upon objective biomarker risk calculator concussion upon physician prognosticate future risk , identify optimal treatment , sport medicine physician , decide particular player safe return play . While majority patient experience full recovery within week concussion , several go chronic , debilitate symptom , patient experience permanently increase risk experience debilitate long-lasting symptom subsequent concussion . For certain people certain genetic ( e.g. , ApoE status ) psychosocial ( e.g. , alcohol abuse , depression ) risk factor , even single concussion put great risk earlier severe form dementia decade hence . The purpose study prospectively collect comprehensive , multi-modality set diagnostics patient concussion , repeat test serially time , investigator may future perform retrospective data mining determine biomarker risk calculator could use guide return-to-play medical decision . This study plan collect biological specimen ( blood , saliva , urine , hair follicle ) , electrophysiological ( EEG , EKG ) , image ( HCT , MRI , PET , SPECT ) , ambulatory ( actigraphy ) , sensory threshold ( Von Frey ) , ophthalmologic ( fundoscopic photograph , OCT , SSVEPs ) , vestibular ( ENG , BESS , BioSway ) along demographic , medical history , medication , psychosocial data result validate instrument cognition , mood , sleep , head discomfort quality life . Because important determine variability within concussion group also group , investigator also recruit control cohort , specifically athletes already undergoing baseline cognitive test pre-season . The clinical focus study concuss athlete , child adult , investigator also include non-sports patient mild traumatic brain injury due situation include slip fall , occupational , motor vehicle accident , assault , blast exposure .</detailed_description>
