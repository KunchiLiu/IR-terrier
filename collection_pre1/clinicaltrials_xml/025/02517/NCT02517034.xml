	<brief_title>Geriatric Assessment Predicting Chemotherapy Toxicity Vulnerabilities Older Patients With Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To identify area vulnerability old adult cancer use geriatric assessment , identify potential referral interdisciplinary team base geriatric assessment result . II . To determine whether geriatric assessment drive intervention lead decrease grade 3-5 toxicity . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether geriatric assessment drive intervention lead improvement follow outcome : unplanned hospitalization , average length stay ( ALOS ) , emergency visit , unplanned readmission rate , advance directive completion . II . To determine whether significantly good quality life ( QOL ) function geriatric assessment intervention group compare standard care group start treatment follow-up timepoint . III . To determine feasibility deliver geriatric assessment driven intervention community set use telemedicine . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 arm . ARM I : Patients follow intervention plan create Nurse Practitioner ( NP ) use result geriatric assessment . The NP discuss result assessment treatment recommendation patient . They also share treatment plan , propose referral , specific vulnerability Primary Care Physician community oncologist . Some patient complete intervention plan via Telehealth , use telecommunication technology provide health service distance . ARM II : Patients follow standard care treatment plan discretion primary oncologist . Beginning 6 month start chemotherapy , patient undergo geriatric assessment Arm I . Some patient complete standard care treatment plan via Telehealth .</detailed_description>
