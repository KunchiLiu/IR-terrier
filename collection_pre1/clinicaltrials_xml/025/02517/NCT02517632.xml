	<brief_title>Physical Exercise Program Chronic Chagas Heart Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The present study consist randomized clinical study conduct Evandro Chagas National Institute Infectious Disease ( INI ) , locate Rio de Janeiro , Brazil . INI national reference center treatment research infectious diseases tropical medicine Brazil , follow large cohort patient Chagas disease , diagnose two simultaneously positive serological test ( enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay indirect immunofluorescence ) . Patients include study randomly divide two group : intervention control group . Safety analysis perform monitoring symptom present data collection follow-up study . One potential risk patient may experience study noninvasive test perform treadmill control environment , possibility appearance symptom fatigue , dyspnea , chest pain , dizziness , minimal chance occur complication difficult clinical control . Except blood test cardiopulmonary exercise test , test perform non-invasive bring risk participant 's health . Will collect 10 ml blood store five year biomarker assessment . During exercise session , patient clinically monitored decompensation , need hospitalization suspend end participation study . All case individually assessed determine reversibility clinical status . Those case continue follow assistant staff , offer clinical support available INI .</detailed_description>
