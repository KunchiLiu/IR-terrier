	<brief_summary>This single-centre , randomised-controlled trial , compare management preschool wheeze . It specifically aim compare management preschool wheeze use current clinical guideline management determine eosinophilic inflammation infection . Participants child age 1-5 year recurrent wheeze allocated one two treatment group , either current clinical care pathological phenotype base management . They ask make 2 study visit Royal Brompton Hospital course 4 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Preschool Wheeze : Inflammation/Infection Guided Management</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study determine efficacy treat preschool wheeze base objective biomarkers inflammation presence bacterial infection , compare current clinical guideline base management . Subjects recruit out-patient clinic attend screening/research visit assessment pathological phenotype ( bacterial infection inflammation ) make induced sputum blood . Their clinical phenotype determine Consultant . Subsequently , patient randomise one two arm : ) current clinical care ( direct Consultant ) ii ) pathological phenotype base management- presence eosinophilia blood ( _ &gt; 2 % ) induce sputum ( &gt; 2.4 % ) - receive twice daily inhaled steroid ( beclometasone 200mcg bd ) 4 month , presence bacterial infection induce sputum oropharyngeal swab- receive 4 week antibiotics targeted isolate , IF BOTH eosinophilic inflammation AND infection present , inflammation alone treat 4 month . All patient continue require bronchodilator therapy , anti-inflammatory therapy ( inhaled steroid ) e.g . montelukast . All participant undergo initial research/screening visit involve follow test : Full blood count Total serum immunoglobulin E radioallergosorbent test house dust mite , grass pollen , tree pollen , cat , dog , aspergillus , milk , egg , peanut Assessment lung function incentive spirometry lung clearance index ( LCI ) use multiple breath washout technique Exhaled nitric oxide- use offline tidal breathing technique Sputum induction use nebulised hypertonic saline Oro- pharyngeal swab Symptom questionnaire Health related quality life questionnaire Management pathological phenotype arm : 1 . Eosinophilic inflammation , bacterial infection : Children sputum eosinophils &gt; 2.4 % blood eosinophils equal 2 % define eosinophilic management follow : ) Regular inhale steroid ( beclometasone 200mcg bd ) 4 month previously regular therapy . ii ) Of child already prescribe inhaled steroid therapy , eosinophilic phenotype continue 4 month . iii ) Children already prescribe regular leukotriene receptor antagonist continue regular inhaled steroid ( beclometasone 200mcg bd ) add maintenance therapy 4 month . iv ) Use require bronchodilator therapy continue 2 . Non- eosinophilic , inflammation , infection : Children either sputum eosinophil _ &lt; 2.4 % blood eosinophil &lt; 2 % define non- eosinophilic management follow : ) Use require bronchodilator acute symptom ii ) Non- eosinophilic child already prescribe regular inhaled steroid ask stop 4 month Children bacterial growth oropharyngeal swab induce sputum , without eosinophilic inflammation continue management accord non-eosinophilic , inflammation , infection profile . 3 . Bacterial infection , eosinophilic inflammation : Children positive bacterial culture result oropharyngeal swab induce sputum treat 4 week course antibiotic . Four week antibiotic therapy use show beneficial previous study severe preschool wheeze . If child already prescribe regular inhaled steroid , stop 4 month . 4 . Eosinophilic inflammation AND bacterial infection : Children raise eosinophil induce sputum blood AND positive bacterial culture manage accord eosinophilic inflammation alone guideline . They give inhale steroid 4 month , antibiotic . This assess one intervention time . However , investigator anticipate many child group previous data show positive bacterial culture unlikely eosinophilia . Management clinical guideline arm : The child treat directed Consultant Paediatrician . The prescription drug use dispense pharmacy department Royal Brompton Hospital- direct clinician . Usually 2 week medication prescribe pharmacy , trial 4 month ` supply give . Concomitant treatment The following medication allow continue intervention period study arm : 1 . Use rescue medication bronchodilator acute symptoms- salbutamol and/or ipratropium bromide 2 . Use leukotriene receptor antagonist- montelukast- continue regardless whether take regularly require acute symptom Monitoring : The trial monitor accord monitoring plan agree write Sponsor , base internal risk assessment procedure . Where appropriate CI ask complete copy Sponsor ` self-monitoring template . It responsibility CI ensure complete submitted research organisation request . It responsibility research organisation determine monitoring risk assessment explain rationale . The study may subject inspection audit Imperial College London remit Sponsor , Study Coordination Centre regulatory body ensure adherence good clinical practice . Statistics Data analysis : Categorical data present number percentage comparison group do use chi square Fishers exact test . All numerical data test normality normally distribute data present mean standard deviation comparison group do use 2 sample independent test . For data normally distribute median ( IQR ) present comparison group do use Mann-Whitney test . Poisson regression do determine factor affect primary endpoint , number unplanned hospital visit . There data check compare data enter registry , predefined rule range use INFORM database . Type subject recruit : All subject age 1 5 year old . All subject moderate severe preschool wheeze , define _ &gt; 2 oral steroid burst acute wheeze last 12 month , least one oral steroid burst last 6 month . Number subject : Based publish data child moderate preschool wheeze apparent approximately five healthcare attendance occur per child per year . In current study , investigator wish reduce proportion healthcare contact least one-third per year . In order achieve 80 % power , accept statistical significance 5 % level , investigator require minimum 36 evaluable patient moderate wheeze per group . Evaluable patient least blood sample assess inflammation oropharyngeal swab determine infection obtain prior randomisation . A total least 72 child therefore recruit . However , minimum number , investigator aim recruit 100 child ( 50 per group ) possible . The number subject base precise power calculation proof concept study determine feasibility approach , inform future power calculation large multi-centre trial address question .</detailed_description>
