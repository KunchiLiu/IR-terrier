	<brief_summary>Every year , nearly 30 % people age 65 fall least 15 % fall least twice . These fall serious consequence significant threat independence well-being old people . From economic perspective , cost medical care relate fall result injury high continue grow age population . Therefore fall prevention public health priority . Many data suggest cognitive , common disorder elderly , major risk factor fall elderly often difficulty manage parallel postural stability situation require attentional resource . Furthermore , data use evoke role vitamin D risk fall elderly . Indeed , vitamin D beneficial effect muscle human brain several recent study show existence positive relationship serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D cognitive function . These different action may explain beneficial effect vitamin D supplementation risk fall practice daily oral dos vitamin D range 700-1000 IU . Our goal study confirm existence link vitamin D status area cognitive function , analyze role play vitamin D deficiency cognitive impairment occurrence fall . The study also seek existence threshold level 25-hydroxyvitamin D may arise cognitive disorder . The prospective follow-up patient 2 year study effect correct vitamin D deficiency ( initial correction regular supplementation ) cognitive function , balance , walk occurrence fall . The study conduct 150 subject age 50 year fell 150 subject age 50 risk fall . These patient enrol Emergency Services , Orthopedics , Geriatrics , Rheumatology University Hospital Caen . All subject receive dose 25 hydroxyvitamin D , comprehensive study cognitive function , test balance walk assessment activity daily live depression . All examination test carry half day . According current recommendation , prescribe treatment Vitamin D subject lower rate 25 hydroxyvitamin D ( &lt; 30 ng / ml ) normalize rate advise doctor prescribe regular supplementation vitamin D order maintain standard rate ( 30 80 ng / ml ) . The effect correction hypovitaminosis D , confirm control rate 25 hydroxyvitamin D , cognitive function , balance walk analyze 3 month 9 month . During two year follow inclusion study , subject contact phone call every 3 month record fall victim , well change drug treatment , particularly case regular intake vitamin D supplementation . If hypothesis true , would appropriate consider new approach prevention fracture involve correction vitamin D deficiency , cognitive rehabilitation cognitive-motor drive subject cognitive impairment .</brief_summary>
