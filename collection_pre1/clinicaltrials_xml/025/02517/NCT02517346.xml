	<brief_title>Efficacy Telemonitoring CPAP Treatment Compliance Obstructive Sleep Apnea ( OSA ) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obstructive Sleep Apnea ( OSA ) define presence repetitive episode upper airway collapse sleep , lead nocturnal hypoxemia , sleep fragmentation daytime sleepiness . When untreated , OSA risk factor arterial hypertension , cardiovascular cerebrovascular disease , road accident bad quality life . The application continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) represent first line therapy patient moderate severe OSA . CPAP treatment improve daytime sleepiness oxygen saturation , reduce cardiovascular risk , ameliorate neurobehavioral performance , improve quality life reduces road accident . Despite demonstrated efficacy , CPAP effectiveness significantly limit poor adherence . A close follow could improve CPAP adherence would take work additional cost sleep unit . So account , investigator propose study demonstrate automatic home treatment monitoring patient OSA cost-effectiveness alternative approach patient 's management . Moreover , investigator believe telemonitoring could improve CPAP compliance patient 's satisfaction reduce follow-up cost . Methods : Prospective randomize study three month . Patients diagnose OSA St. Maria 's Hospital ( Sleep Unit ) require CPAP treatment , randomize two group differ CPAP compliance monitoring management . Group 1 Standard care Patients fit mask give CPAP instruct use device . Patients follow standard treatment management . All patient visit 1 month sleep unit . Patients check progress adherence therapy problem machine . Information download machine ( CPAP adherence , apply CPAP pressure , mask leak , residual respiratory eventsâ€¦ ) . Group 2 Telemonitoring Patients fit mask give CPAP . Each CPAP device provide modem send daily compliance information ( CPAP adherence , CPAP pressure , mask leak , residual respiratory event ) web database . Patients 2 group finally visit 3 month sleep unit .</detailed_description>
