	<brief_title>Effect Early Nutritional Therapy Frailty , Functional Outcomes Recovery Undernourished Medical Inpatients Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aims randomized-controlled , multicenter EFFORT trial test hypothesis medical inpatient risk undernutrition define nutritional risk score ( NRS 2002 ) , early tailor nutritional therapy reach nutritional target base individualized nutritional counseling cost-effective strategy prevent mortality , morbidity functional decline . The primary composite endpoint combine adverse outcome within 30 day define ( ) all-cause mortality , ( b ) admission intensive care unit medical ward , ( c ) major complication , ( ) unplanned hospital readmission ( ) decline functional outcome admission day 30 assess Barthel ` index ( -10 % ) . Secondary endpoint include ( ) single component primary endpoint ( b ) short-term nutritional functional outcome inclusion day 10 hospital discharge ; ( c ) hospital outcome ; ( ) 30-day 180-day outcome ( e ) Other safety endpoint include adverse gastrointestinal effect associate nutritional therapy assess daily hospital discharge . The investigator include unselected adult medical inpatient risk undernutrition [ NRS≥3 point ] expect hospital stay ≥5 day willing provide inform consent . The investigator exclude patient critical care post-operative state , unable swallow , long-term need parenteral/enteral nutrition , terminal condition , pregnant , acute pancreatitis acute liver failure , anorexia nervosa , earlier included trial Patients intervention group receive individualize nutritional therapy reach nutritional target ( caloric , protein , micronutrient , ) base predefined nutritional strategy . In control patient , accord patient ` appetite , standard hospital nutrition serve . Nutritional therapy may start control patient , sort swallow disorder develop patient need prepared operation . All patient re-assessed daily hospital stay nutritional intake nutritional therapy may escalate every 24-48 hour ( food fortification , oral supplement , enteral , parenteral nutrition ) target meet ( least 75 % target ) . The targeted sample size 2000 - 3000 patient . The inclusion 2000 - 3000 patient provide 76 % 91 % power detect reduction primary endpoint 15 % ( 40 % 34 % ) assuming lose follow rate 10 % .</detailed_description>
