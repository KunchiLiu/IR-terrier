	<brief_summary>The purpose study learn cause insulin resistance . It suggest proper breakdown fat energy ( oxidation ) body important allow insulin keep blood sugar normal range . The investigator want know one fatty acid oxidation disorder could influence insulin action . Fatty acid oxidation disorder genetic disorder inhibit one enzymes convert fat energy . The investigator study normal healthy people people long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorder .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The overall goal proposal investigate effect disorder mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation insulin resistance human . Mitochondrial dysfunction implicate development insulin resistance type 2 diabetes excess dietary fat intake increase release endogenous free fatty acid , occur obesity . Controversy exist , however , whether insulin resistance result intrinsic defect mitochondrial energy utilization abnormality result excess free fatty acid flux , well role subsequent accumulation cellular metabolic intermediate play impaired insulin signal . To address controversy , investigator study unique population patient inherit defect three mitochondrial enzyme fatty acid oxidation pathway : 1 ) long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase ( VLCAD ) ; 2 ) trifunctional protein ( TFP , include long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase ( LCHAD ) ) ; 3 ) medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase ( MCAD ) . These protein require oxidation sequentially short fatty acid . The investigator test hypothesis intrinsic defect mitochondrial function involve oxidation long-chain , medium-chain , fatty acid sufficient prevent intralipid-induced insulin resistance .</detailed_description>
