	<brief_summary>Anthocyanins common polyphenols berry red wine , along flavonoid , phenolic acid , mineral vitamin . Anthocyanins extensively metabolize transformed glucuronides phenolic acid . The investigator recently show acute consumption blueberry lead increase endothelium-dependent vasodilation measure flow-mediated dilatation ( FMD ) young male volunteer . There significant correlation effect plasma concentration phenolic acid anthocyanin metabolite . Therefore , present study aim understand extent anthocyanins contain berry relate positive effect endothelial function . A large part absorb anthocyanin circulate blood methyl , glucuronyl sulfate metabolite , well phenolic acid . The formation metabolites begin right early 2h consumption due metabolism small intestine second plasmatic peak occur around 6h due metabolism colonic bacteria . Whether metabolites associate biological effect mechanisms underlying effect remain unclear .</brief_summary>
