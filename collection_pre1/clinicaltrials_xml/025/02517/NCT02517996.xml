	<brief_summary>Interstitial cystitis/Painful bladder syndrome ( IC/PBS ) chronic debilitate condition severely impact 2.7 6.5 percent woman United States . Despite public health importance pathogenesis IC/PBS well understood consensus optimal treatment approach condition . Hydrodistention commonly use therapy condition ; limit severe immediate postoperative bladder pain short duration action . It postulate hydrodistention work disrupt sensory nerve within bladder may contribute bladder pain . Recent evidence provide support use preemptive pudendal nerve block way blunt immediate postoperative pain . The investigator hypothesize preemptive pudendal nerve block prior hydrodistention result lower postoperative pain hydrodistention compare placebo . This prospective double- blind randomize study patient randomize receive preemptive bilateral pudendal nerve block either 1 % lidocaine placebo . Bladder pain compare baseline , 2 hour , 2 week , 6 week 3 month use Visual Analog Scale , O'Leary-Sant questionnaire Pelvic Pain Urgency Frequency questionnaire .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use Preemptive Pudendal Nerve Block Prior Hydrodistention Treatment Interstitial Cystitis/Painful Bladder Syndrome ( IC/PBS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Painful bladder syndrome/interstitial cystitis ( IC/PBS ) disorder characterize chronic bladder pain discomfort . The exact underlying etiology IC/PBS unknown however several theory exist include epithelial dysfunction , mast cell activation , neurogenic inflammation . Whatever underlie incite factor IC/PBS , result phenotype one urinary frequency , urgency bladder pain improve voiding . Animal study show normal bladder fill , mechanoreceptors bladder wall respond stretch discharge afferent innervation nerve fire . In normal human , conscious perception bladder fill threshold volume reached4 . Patients PBS/IC think substantially low cystometric bladder volume heighten sensitivity bladder filling . Mechanoreceptors chemoreceptor bladder may trigger myelinated A- delta C-fibers find smooth muscle submucosa response bladder distention . A- delta fiber distribute mainly within detrusor smooth muscle responsive detrusor stretch occur bladder fill . In contrast , C-type fiber seem widespread distribute detrusor muscle , within lamina propria close proximity urothelium . There considerable interest mechanism underlie sensitization C-fiber afferent , nerve think play key role symptom IC/PBS . It show plexus afferent nerve dense region bladder neck proximal urethra . Lumbosacral afferent fiber pelvic pudendal nerve , cell body lumbosacral dorsal root ganglion ( DRG ) , sense pain also regulate continence micturition . In laboratory animal , pelvic nerve supply contain stretch-responsive afferent fiber appear important response bladder over-distention . Neurologic change see occurrence cystitis bladder insult suggest reorganization reflex connection spinal cord change bladder afferent , may suggest great role influence pudendal nerve bladder pain previously think . The pudendal nerve peripheral nerve mainly compose afferent sensory fiber sacral nerve root S1 , S2 , S3 consequently major contributor bladder afferent regulation bladder function . Pudendal nerve entrapment often lead significant void dysfunction include urinary incontinence active bladder syndrome Furthermore , pudendal nerve carry large percentage afferent fiber , attractive target neuromodulation treat refractory overactive bladder may useful modulate pain experience IC/PBS . No treatment consistently show provide relief majority patient painful bladder syndrome . Furthermore , combination treatment modality need majority patient . Cystoscopy hydrodistention think useful therapeutic tool patient unresponsive therapy like medication pelvic floor physical therapy ; however , use study observational study currently list third line treatment option IC/PBS . According interstitial cystitis database study experience cystoscopy hydrodistention report commonly use treatment modality IC/PBS publish study report improvement symptom 70 80 percent patient study report improvement 40 percent . It postulate hydrodistention work disrupt sensory nerve within bladder may contribute bladder pain enable regeneration afferent sensory nerve . Though exact mechanism action unclear , ample evidence suggest efficacy cystoscopy hydrodistention , recent study Chien-Ying et al , therapeutic hydrodistension associate increase bladder capacity significant reduction average O'Leary- Sant symptom problem score treatment . In addition , Aihara et al determine positive therapeutic outcome 71 % patient 1 month hydrodistention report similar finding . The disadvantage hydrodistention patient experience temporary worsening symptom immediately follow procedure beneficial effect often last 2-6 week . The immediate worsening bladder symptom immediately hydrodistention relatively short duration effect often deterrents recommend therapy patient . Given multimodal approach manage patient IC/PBS imperative investigator explore way prolong efficacy available option one approach recently suggest use preemptive analgesia . In 1983 , Woolf propose persistent pain experience trauma surgery due posttraumatic functional change peripheral pain receptor also dorsal horn spinal cord property know hyperexcitability . The hyperexcitable state persists long stimuli cease , cause patient perceive pain stimulus normally believe painless common occurrence think see patient IC/PBS . Therefore , prevention spinal hyperexcitability blockade afferent nerve pathway surgical site spinal cord may therefore decrease amount duration postoperative pain perception . This theory test various animal study first describe Wall 1988 . In addition , current literature preemptive analgesia gynecology supportive approach . In study Ismail et al , 130 patient undergoing posterior colporrhaphy randomize receive preemptive pudendal nerve block either .25 % bupivacaine normal saline . Study finding demonstrate average postoperative VAS score 51.1 bupivacaine group compare 23.5 placebo group . The investigator postulate since pudendal nerve important contributor bladder afferent regulation , preemptive nerve block prior hydrodistention may block afferent impulse transmission spinal cord decrease initial increase postoperative bladder pain .</detailed_description>
