	<brief_summary>Chronic nonspecific low back pain important health condition high prevalence worldwide associate enormous direct indirect cost society . Clinical practice guideline show many intervention available treat patient chronic low back pain , vast majority intervention modest effect reduce pain disability . A biomechanical approach raise weakness hip abductor , extensor , lateral rotators musculature ( posterolateral complex - PLC ) would lead excessive contralateral pelvic drop weight-bearing activity walk , run , climb downstairs , generate overload lumbar area . Although strengthen hip PLC largely use clinical practice treat patient hip knee injury , still lack evidence regard patient low back pain . Therefore , question remain efficacy hip dynamic stabilization additional intervention conventional treatment well design trial statistic power .</brief_summary>
