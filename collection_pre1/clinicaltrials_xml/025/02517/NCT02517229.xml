	<brief_summary>The scientific goal experiment evaluate change balance control response microgravity reactive balance task . For purpose , kinematic neuromuscular parameter microgravity compare normal gravity condition . To induce postural response among test subject , electromagnetic maneuverable postural platform use order randomly elicit perturbation . Postural reaction quantify mean mechanical electromyographic data . In Addition , peripheral nerve stimulation use assess spinal excitability mean H-reflex recording . H-reflex measurement choose allow reliable information inhibitory facilitatory mechanism take place spinal level .</brief_summary>
