	<brief_summary>This randomize clinical trial study accelerate recovery pathway discharge surgery patient pancreatic cancer . A standardized accelerated recovery pathway may improve outcome surgery follow complex abdominal operation result shorter length stay patient pancreatic cancer . It may also help patient mobilize quickly return home setting , decrease hospital-acquired infectious complication , increase potential cost saving . It yet know whether accelerated recovery pathway well standard recovery pathway discharge follow surgery patient pancreatic cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Accelerated Recovery Pathway Discharge After Surgery Patients With Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . The use accelerate pathway result shorter postoperative hospital length stay patient undergo pancreaticoduodenectomy ( PD ) without increase perioperative complication readmission rate . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . The investigator anticipate low cost , low readmission rate , similar rate post-operative complication ( delay gastric empty [ DGE ] , anastomotic leak , intra-abdominal abscess , wound infection , urinary tract infection [ UTI ] , respiratory compromise , renal failure , etc . ) study group . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients follow standard 7-day pathway end surgery . ARM II : Patients follow Whipple accelerate 5-day pathway end surgery . The accelerated pathway include rapidly leave ICU setting , early mobilization enhance physical therapy , multimodal pain control , dietary modification , increase standardized phone contact nurse practitioner first week follow hospital discharge . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
