	<brief_summary>The main purpose Phase I study test MSB0011359C ( M7824 ) different dose level see safe well tolerate give every 2 week . Phase I mean study drug previously give human give limited number people , although extensively study animal . Based information , hop find dose could best treatment patient . There two part research study : dose-escalation part expansion part . Dose escalation mean first people take part study receive low dos study drug , people take part , additional participant receive high dose . This do find safest dose study drug . Expansion mean dose-escalation part study look safety effectiveness different dos , many people invited take part study receive study drug safe dose . Additional purpose study find whether study drug anti-cancer effect study drug process body .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This Phase I , open-label , dose-escalation trial consecutive parallel-group expansion select solid tumor indication . The current trial compose standard dose escalation `` 3 + 3 '' cohort design , 3 6 subject enrol dose level depend occurrence dose limit toxicity ( DLTs ) , follow consecutive parallel-group expansion select solid tumor indication . Cohorts 3 subject metastatic locally advanced solid tumor , standard effective therapy exist standard therapy fail , receive MSB0011359C ( M7824 ) escalate dose level . After determination Maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) , enrollment several expansion cohort open determine safety , pharmacokinetic ( PK ) / Pharmacodynamic , clinical activity MSB0011359C ( M7824 ) . Subjects experience confirm complete response ( CR ) continue treatment end 12 month , although additional treatment possible . In case progressive disease ( PD ) , subject continue treatment next tumor assessment . Additional indication plan base emerge data field .</detailed_description>
