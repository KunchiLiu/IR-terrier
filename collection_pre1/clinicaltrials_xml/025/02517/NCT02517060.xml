	<detailed_description>Brain response healthy participant record functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) . While scanned participant ask recommend punishment similar judge jury perpetrator across different scenario . In addition , participant prim read scenario use different material . Based recent theory `` embodied cognition '' extralegal factor investigator hypothesize prime may influence harshness punishment recommend participant . If process engage sensorimotor cortex , result would strongly support theory embody cognition . The result would help investigator understand neural correlate prim process . These unconscious complex process perception may important hospital patient . Thus , beneficial haptic experience hospital stay may contribute successful recovery .</detailed_description>
