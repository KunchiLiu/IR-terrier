	<brief_summary>Weightlessness profoundly modify many physiological system especially nervous system vestibular system . The change nervous system base part brain plasticity mechanism , say modification neuron connection . They source behavioral response observe parabolic flight astronaut . For example , commonly observe second third day parabolic flight campaign 3 flight , few participant prone motion sickness first day . Similarly , first trip space , astronauts suffer 2/3 2 3 day space sickness - special form motion sickness - proportion much low second trip . The hypothesis study short-term weightlessness well change level gravity experience parabolic flight , induce neuroplascity phenomenon brain region involve integration vestibular , visual proprioceptive . The goal objectify plasticity phenomenon , assess change time , use method Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) . A standard MRI give anatomical image brain . For study , variant call diffusion MRI ( Diffusion Tensor Imaging - DTI ) visualize nerve bundle journey brain . The total duration review ¾ hour . The result study compare ongoing study 12 astronaut MRI scan take trip International Space Station . Investigators evaluate effect duration exposure weightlessness phenomena neuroplasticity .</brief_summary>
