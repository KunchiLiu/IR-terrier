	<brief_summary>Mortality severe Community-Acquired Pneumonia ( CAP ) decline time 25 30 % sub-groups patient . Corticosteroids ( CTx ) could down-regulate pulmonary systemic inflammation , accelerate clinical resolution decrease rate inflammation-associated systemic complication . Two recent meta-analyses suggest positive effect severe CAP day 28 survival CTx add standard therapy . However base four trial gather less 300 patient , one positive . Recently publish guideline recommend CTx part CAP treatment . Therefore well-powered trial appear necessary test hypothesis CTx - specifically hydrocortisone - could improve day 28 survival critically-ill patient severe CAP , severity assess either Pulmonary Severity Index ≥ 130 ( Fine class V ) use mechanical ventilation high-FiO2 high-flow oxygen therapy . A phase-III multicenter add-on randomize control double-blind superiority trial assess efficacy hydrocortisone vs. placebo Day 28 all-causes mortality , addition antibiotic supportive care , include correction hypoxemia . Randomization stratify : ( ) center ; ( ii ) use mechanical ventilation time inclusion .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients receive state-of-the-art standard therapy severe Community-Acquired Pneumonia ( CAP ) , include antibiotic supportive care . Correction hypoxemia use standard low-flow oxygen therapy , high-flow oxygen therapy , non-invasive-ventilation invasive ventilation endotracheal tube , require . Patients treatment group receive intra-venous hydrocortisone . Patients control group receive intravenous placebo intravenous route frequency . Hydrocortisone placebo give double-blind fashion 8 14 full day . The intravenous route use . The treatment course include 4 7 day full dose ( 200 mg/day continuous infusion ) , 2 4 day half dose ( 100 mg/day continuous infusion ) , 2 3 day taper dose ( 50 mg/day continuous infusion ) . Duration treatment choose upon patient initial improvement .</detailed_description>
