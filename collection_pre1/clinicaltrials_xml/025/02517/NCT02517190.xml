	<brief_summary>From previous parabolic flight campaign complete research group investigator gather data show important change neuro‐endocrine also immunological change . This experiment complete data set‐up obtain MARS500 study respective individual re‐act highly physically emotionally challenging situation parabolic flight . This add‐on experiment MARS500 enable answer follow question ) stress response system - compare two condition individual - react uniformly ii ) subject prone adequate stress response pattern show gradually less immune modulation effect . The understanding complex interaction stress immunity chronic acute stress condition might help enable adequate health immune monitoring might well suggest suitable countermeasure prevention unwanted immunological effect long‐term confinement space mission .</brief_summary>
