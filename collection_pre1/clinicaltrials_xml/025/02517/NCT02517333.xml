	<brief_summary>The importance play physical activity include many benefit positively improve health well-being , enhance child 's young people 's think performance school , improve sleep enable confidence skill building ( Janssen LeBlanc , 2010 ; Budde et al. , 2008 ; Sallis Patrick , 1994 ) . However , child movement difficulty ( MD ) physical disability risk decreased physical activity subsequently decrease physical fitness overall health well-being result . To build upon current finding follow-up continue study , look impact ( response ) recovery follow acute exercise different intensity child adolescent without movement difficulty , next phase aim provide intervention improve fitness level health measure strategically provide pathway long term participation physical activity young people . Implement evaluate pathway sport 14+ year old young people regularly participate sport due Neurodevelopmental condition , young people present poor coordination movement , even child adolescent special educational need . The pathway hop promote engagement , participation , inclusion confidence ( EPIC ) sport within local school community 1 ) target recruitment , 2 ) confidence skill building ( EPIC Club ) , 3 ) connection sport ( 'Have go day ' ) 4 ) exit long term participation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>According World Health Organization ( WHO ) , physical inactivity recognize fourth lead risk factor global mortality non-communicable disease , therefore , support participation variety physical activity include play , game , sport , plan exercise resistance training . In accordance , UK physical activity guideline child young people ( age 5-18 ) Chief Medical Officer ( CMO ) recommend regular participation moderate vigorous physical activity ( PA ) least 60 minute day reduce risk child develop cardiovascular condition later life . Moreover , prevalence neurodevelopmental condition affect motor-developmental skill believe affect 5-6 % school-aged child thus , lead wide interest regard physical health well-being child adolescent due low level fitness participation PA observe . Participation PA often hamper limited motor performance capacity young people movement difficulty ( MD ) . Furthermore , individual poorer motor skill movement difficulty include Developmental Coordination Disorder ( DCD ) cerebral palsy ( CP ) report low energy level , muscle fatigue poor physical tolerance factor contribute reduced enjoyment , tolerance participation PA. As consequence , research explore fitness PA pattern child adolescent poor motor proficiency present alarm risk profile cardiovascular disease , due high percentage body fat , decrease aerobic capacity , generally decrease participation PA impact proper development may persist adulthood . Because child MD less able tolerate certain type exercise tend show low level activity , great risk develop secondary disorder associate physical inactivity compare typically develop age peer . Furthermore , although show child MD willing push maximally , many fail exercise hard enough tax cardiovascular system , potentially due contribute low exercise tolerance low fitness ; play role vicious cycle . Previous work show condition child 's muscle strength may major contribute factor exercise ( particularly intensity high enough train effect ) . Strength essential component motor skill performance become crucial element incorporate training intervention . Therefore , develop competence confidence perform resistance strength exercise developmental year may important long-term implication health , fitness sport performance even youth few opportunity . In accordance , measure fitness appear interconnect , level motor skill impairment show related maximal oxygen consumption VO2 peak attain muscular strength . Exploring relationship VO2max endurance performance child may provide insight basic role physiologic fitness dictate physical capacity identify appropriate training regimen youth . Therefore , important gain comprehensive picture impact exercise health functional measure develop understanding physiological , psychological social aspect limit successful long-term PA among child MD . Implementing intervention involve task improve fitness measure , also coordination , muscle function performance , essential . Based recent Cochrane intervention review look school-based PA program promote PA fitness child adolescent age 6-18 year , author suggest young people expose train intervention spend time engage moderate-to-vigorous PA ( result across study range 5 - 45 min day ) , spend less time watch television ( result range five-60 min less day ) improve VO2max ( maximal oxygen uptake ) . However , school-based intervention effective increase PA rate among adolescent , reduce health fitness marker ( i.e . blood pressure , blood cholesterol , BMI heart rate ) ( Dobbins et al. , 2013 ) , possibly due insufficient PA intensity . Furthermore , research study effect acute bout exercise cognition provide compelling evidence influence exercise work memory . Preliminary result current study explore impact acute exercise high low exercise intensity already show different cognitive response individual MD compare typically develop ( TD ) peer . Although evidence cite positive impact increase PA play mood behaviour , social relationship , sleep , cognition , academic performance overall well-being , additional research explore development , execution , implementation feasibility pathways increase participation long-term PA training warrant . A fitness screen session designate year group ( i.e . Year 9 ) hold mainstream school Oxfordshire . Those score bottom quintile fitness test and/or motor skill assessment screen invite take part 6 week training programme ( EPIC Club ) . Participants volunteer take part need attend assessment train intervention evaluation outcome measure include look aerobic fitness level , muscle strength , cognitive function questionnaire focus self-esteem/self-perception . The aims EPIC Club improve fitness level , build confidence skill provide pathway sport via 'Have go ' Sports Taster Days hold throughout year . Steering group focus group also hold invite participant , parent coach provide feedback progress pathway . Moreover , evaluation quantitative qualitative outcome measure need addressed . Aims : 1 . To deliver pathway longer-term participation physical activity sport via 1 ) target recruitment , 2 ) confidence skill building ( EPIC Club ) , 3 ) connection sport ( 'Have go day ' ) 4 ) exit long term participation 2 . Evaluation assessment pathway progress quantitative qualitative outcome measure ( fitness physical health measure ) 3 . To explore impact pathway program functioning domain , cognitive function , performance school , sleep , self-esteem social well-being . Community Benefits : This study aim provide pathway engagement , participation , inclusion confidence ( EPIC ) sport young people regularly participate physical activity sport due Neurodevelopmental condition , young people present poor coordination movement and/or include individual special educational need . With rise obesity lower physical activity level , important provide feasible meaningful way young individual participate exercise sport community sport activation .</detailed_description>
