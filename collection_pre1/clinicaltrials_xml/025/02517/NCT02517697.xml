	<brief_title>Oral Nitrite Trial Hypertension Metabolic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease remain leading cause death United States worldwide . Several study demonstrate fruit vegetable rich diet significantly reduce blood pressure reduce risk ischemic stroke cardiovascular disease general , exact mechanism remain poorly understood . Preclinical clinical research last decade reveal important vasoprotective effect nitrate nitrite regard reduction blood pressure , vascular inflammation endothelial dysfunction . More recent finding suggest inorganic nitrate nitrite therapy may involve regulation glucose-insulin homeostasis . For reason , development oral formulation nitrite salt represent rational avenue exploration treatment cardiovascular disease , whereby nitrite would ensure rapid act effect upon absorption . Nitrite could oxidize nitrate via enterosalivary circulation pathway . In pathway , 25 % circulate nitrate concentrate saliva reduce nitrite commensal mouth bacteria nitrate reductase enzyme . The proposal investigate inorganic nitrite effect ( form ) insulin sensitivity target population overweight/obese adult metabolic syndrome hypertension , risk insulin resistance endothelial dysfunction . This third human trial use orally deliver nitrite ( previously aqueous solution ) .</detailed_description>
