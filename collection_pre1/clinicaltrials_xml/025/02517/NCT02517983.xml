	<brief_summary>World Health Organization ( WHO ) consider chronic respiratory disease ( CRD ) one four priority . These disease include asthma rhinitis , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , occupational lung disease , sleep apnoea syndrome , pulmonary hypertension , bronchiectasis interstitial lung disease . They constitute serious public health problem country throughout world , particular low middle income country deprive population . Hundreds million people age , country world , affect chronic respiratory disease . More 50 % live low middle income country . Over 90 % death complete inability , due CRDs occur country low middle income . The main cause CRD : tobacco smoke , occupational factor , indoor air pollution outdoor air pollution , allergen , sequelae respiratory infection tuberculosis . More 30 % population Ho Chi Minh City ( HCMC ) could develop CRD . In fact , 15 % child 7 % adult could become asthma 6 % population could become COPD due smoking . Children expose fume biomass burning , early life , seem high risk develop COPD . The high level air pollution HCMC could aggravate asthma / COPD . Populations combine rural risk ( exposure smoke biomass ) urban risk ( smoking , pollution ) may develop COPD much early ( age 40 ) . Among 9 million people HCMC , 50 % population rural origin . Within population , parasite could play protective role risk allergic asthma consequently , good control helminthiasis among urban population , may result allergic disease asthma anaphylaxis . Finally , sequelae tuberculosis ( incidence 200/100000 ) could participate morbidity COPD / CRD . Study grant ARES-CUD ( `` Comission universitaire au développement '' )</brief_summary>
