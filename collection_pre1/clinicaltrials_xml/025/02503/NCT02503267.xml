	<detailed_description>Congenital disorder glycosylation ( CDG ) family inherit disorder cause defect synthesis glycans , glycoprotein glycoconjugates . Congenital disorder glycosylation ( CDG ) family inherit disorder cause defect synthesis glycans , glycoprotein glycoconjugates . Glycosylation proteins crucial proper organ morphogenesis appropriate coagulation system function . The neurological system commonly affect type disorder case CDG normal neurological development recently describe . The group Experimental Hematology Clinic Oncology University Murcia ( Spain ) recently describe rare disorder glycosylation ( ALG12-CDG ) cause antithrombin deficiency patient 19 year history repair ventricular septal defect . On hand , population study show increased incidence thromboembolic event patient congenital heart disease compare general population . The identified genetic defect involve development congenital heart diseases variable incomplete penetrance case molecular basis completely unknown . The investigator postulate CDG might behind development form congenital heart disease contribute great prevalence thromboembolic event patient population .</detailed_description>
