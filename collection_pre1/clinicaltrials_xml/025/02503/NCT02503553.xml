	<brief_summary>Identifying make decision best health treatment screen option difficult patient . Decision aid use one reasonable option , option clear advantage term health outcome , option benefit harm patient may value differently . Decision aid may pamphlets , video , web-based tool . They make decision explicit , describe option available , help people understand option well possible benefit harm . This help patient consider option personal view ( e.g. , important possible benefit harm ) help participate health practitioner make decision . Cerebral aneurysms common potentially dangerous . However , important treatment choice may prevent bleed stroke aneurysm rupture.Current procedural option clip endovascular coiling . The anatomy aneurysm amenable either treatment . The treatment decision simple , since choice trade-off . How benefit trade-offs value varies across different patient , , therefore , right treatment decision need include great patient participation . This start good communication probability associate outcome option term understood patient . Equally important help patient clarify treatment goal , well legitimize patient ' partnership decision-making process . Tools ( e.g. , decision aid ) achieve share decision-making , lack area medicine . We propose investigate impact decision aid patient satisfaction outcomes cerebral aneurysm coil clip . Aim 1 . To determine whether structured decision aid offer cerebral aneurysm patient associate increased patient participation decision make process indicate OPTION score Aim 2 . To determine whether structured decision aid offer cerebral aneurysm patient associate improved quality life patient satisfaction outcome immediately preoperatively , 30 day postoperatively .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Our study include patient present clinic diagnosis cerebral aneurysm . Patients surgical intervention deem necessary approached participation study . After sign informed consent , randomize receive document serve decision aid ( option grid ) . If randomize control receive standard information booklet . Patients give minute read option grid choice , chance ask question two possible treatment ( cerebral aneurysm clipping , cerebral aneurysm coil ) . The remainder interaction patient provider affect way . The physician free make recommendation base best judgment , patient free choose base preference . The visit patient voice record ( immediately completion encounter ) score base OPTION score , assess patient participation share decision make process . Patients interview preoperatively day operation , immediately postoperatively , 30-days postoperatively ( via telephone ) . Performance secondary outcome measure record . Variables analyze use Fisher exact test categorical variable nonparametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test continuous variable . Logistic regression perform , binary outcome . Linear regression perform continuous outcome .</detailed_description>
