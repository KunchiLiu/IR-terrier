	<brief_title>STYLE -- A Trial Cell Enriched Adipose For Androgenetic Alopecia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The STYLE Trial prospective , randomize , multi-center device trial intend evaluate safety efficacy Celution Puregraft Systems process preparation autologous fat graft enrich adipose-derived regenerative cell ( ADRCs ) treatment early alopecia androgenetica . Patients may include undergo elective cosmetic liposuction . Following informed consent screen evaluation , eligible subject undergo pre-operative testing . Subjects undergo fat harvest use local anesthesia without conscious sedate . Subjects randomly assign receive fat graft cell enrich ADRCs ( available two different dos ) , fat graft without cell enrichment use visually-matched blood saline solution ( fat alone control ) , saline injection ( no-fat control ) 2:2:2:1 ratio . While undergo liposuction , lipoaspirate process Puregraft System remove lipoaspirate impurity Celution System isolate concentrate ADRCs . After liposuction complete ) , patient , ring block local anesthesia ( see description ) , subcutaneous scalp injection either Puregraft purify autologous fat saline ( no-fat control ) follow separate second injection , either ADRCs ( available two different dos ) , visually-matched blood saline solution ( fat alone control ) , saline ( no-fat control ) 2:2:2:1 ratio . The STYLE Clinical Trial sample size 70 patient eight ( 8 ) center .</detailed_description>
