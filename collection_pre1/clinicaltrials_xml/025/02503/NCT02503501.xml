	<brief_title>Intranasal Glulisine Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment Probable Mild Alzheimer 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Disruption central nervous system ( CNS ) insulin signal increasingly associate Alzheimer 's Disease pathogenesis , consequently disease referred type III diabetes brain . Clinical trial intranasal insulin AD demonstrate therapeutic effect intranasal ( IN ) insulin memory-impaired adult term memory recall without significantly alter serum insulin glucose level . In study , investigator investigate chronic effect rapid act insulin , glulisine , administer intranasally ( IN ) 20 IU two time daily adult amnestic-mild cognitive impairment ( a-MCI ) mild Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . The investigation enroll n=90 subject follow 6 month period . This study follow objective : 1 . Primary : . To measure chronic effect IN insulin glulisine cognition function subject aMCI probable mild AD 6 month period . 2 . Secondary : 1 . To measure effect IN insulin glulisine mood subject aMCI mild AD 6 month period . 2 . To measure safety efficacy IN glulisine aMCI mild AD subject non-insulin dependent diabetes 6 month period . 3 . Exploratory : 1 . To measure effect IN delivery insulin glulisine parieto-temporal posterior cingulate/precuneus glucose metabolism subject aMCI mild AD 6 month period . 2 . To measure chronic effect IN delivery insulin glulisine AD-specific cerebrospinal ( CSF ) biomarkers ( Abeta42 , tau , phospho-tau ) subject aMCI mild AD 6 month period .</detailed_description>
