	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate tranexamic acid ( TXA ) Intravenous oral , equivalent oxytocin ( OXY ) , intramuscularly , reduce blood loss post partum period ( mL ) patient end pregnancy ( 37-42 w ) low risk post partum hemorrhage ( PPH ) . The PPH mean blood loss equal great 500 ml vaginal delivery ( bleed define severe exceeds 1000 mL ) . PPH call `` primary '' blood loss arise within 24 hour birth . This open-trial randomized , longitudinal , control include 486 subject .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Study Assess Equivalence Tranexamic Acid v Oxytocin Reducing PPH ( TRANOXY2015 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This trial include three arm treatment : - arm A ( IMP1Test ) : TXA 500mg/ 2 vial ( 1 gr ) oral within 5 minute delivery ( third stage af labor ) - arm B ( IMP2Test ) : TXA 500 mg/ 2 vial ( 1 gr ) slow intravenous infusion 1ml/min within 5 minute delivery ( third stage af labor ) - arm C ( control ) : OXY 5 IU/ml/ 2 vial ( 10 International Unit ) intramuscularly within 5 minute delivery ( third stage af labor ) The clamp umbilical cord execute immediately birth The randomization 1:1:1 ( block design ) , generate computer . Primary outcome : assessment total blood loss express mL - immediately delivery - two hour delivery The measurement overall blood loss delivery ( ml ) perform graduated bag , immediately birth . The measurement two hour delivery perform weigh adsorbent material [ N.ml = N. gr indicate balance - dry weight sanitary napkin ] . The overall loss blood measure ( ml ) two hour delivery perform add two collection .</detailed_description>
