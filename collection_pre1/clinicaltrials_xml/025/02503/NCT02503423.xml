	<detailed_description>ASTX660 synthetic small molecule dual antagonist cellular inhibitor apoptosis protein ( cIAP ) 1 X-linked inhibitor apoptosis protein ( XIAP ) show potent proapoptotic tumor growth inhibitory activity nonclinical model . ASTX660 previously evaluate human subject . The Phase 1 portion study determine MTD , RP2D , recommend dose regimen . The Phase 2 portion evaluate activity select tumor type . Subjects continue receive assign treatment throughout study occurrence disease progression , death , unacceptable treatment-related toxicity , study close sponsor . Tolerability safety study treatment evaluate throughout study collection clinical laboratory data . In Phase 2 , antitumor response assess accord standard Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST v1.1 ) use compute tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan assess use another reliable method disease evaluation appropriate tumor type .</detailed_description>
