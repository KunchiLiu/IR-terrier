	<brief_summary>Purpose : Inflammatory bowel disease patient undergoing treatment vary biologic agent evaluate incidence paradoxical immune reaction , risk factor associate paradoxical immune reaction , whether paradoxical immune reaction associate risk factor differ base formulation biologic agent . Participants : All adult ( ≥18 year ) confirm IBD biologic agent plan initiate treatment 1 month Procedures ( method ) : Subjects undergo treatment biologic agent follow indefinitely paradoxical immune reaction . Data collect baseline well serum plasma banking . Subjects follow 6 month interval either via email , telephone interview time clinic follow-up visit . In event de-novo paradoxical reaction , specific information collect sit event capture form , data abstract routine clinical care paradoxical reaction . Subjects continue follow every 3 month event via email , telephone contact determine whether resolution and/or recurrence occur , determine change medical therapy . Serum plasma re-collected time first event comparison baseline sample sample control ( biologics without study document paradoxical immune reaction ) . At resolution event , patient return 6 month follow schedule . Subjects discontinue and/or fail particular biologic treatment ; therefore also follow paradoxical immune reaction , new biologic treatment undergo study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Autoimmune Paradoxical Reactions IBD Longitudinal Cohort</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria : All adult ( ≥18 year ) confirm IBD biologic agent plan initiate within 1 month ( defined anti-TNF , natalizumab , vedolizumab ustekinumab ) enrol prospective cohort ( initially pilot set 5 site , later full funding involve site CRA ) . Individuals current biologic use include ( i.e . prevalent user ) , record collect time initial biologic start , prior specific formulation . Ideally , new initiator biologic agent recruit visit decision make start biologic agent . Those prior history one 4 described paradoxical outcome associate biologic agent also include prevalent case order increase sample size , appropriate clinical information collect per medical record . All data prevalent case enter historically prospective follow still occur ensure paradoxical reaction recur . Exposures : Data collect baseline include demographic disease specific factor , concomitant medication , laboratory data , well serum plasma banking . Follow : Individuals follow 6 month interval either via email , telephone interview time clinic follow-up visit . Data event form outcomes occur point follow collect real-time clinic , trigger standard follow-up 6 month . Outcome paradoxical immune reaction : Outcomes define ) psoriaform skin lesion , b ) drug-induced lupus c ) demyelinate disorder ) vasculitis . In event de-novo paradoxical reaction , specific information collect sit event capture form , data abstract routine clinical care paradoxical reaction . Medical record obtain confirm response , copy pathology ( dermatologic biopsy ) radiology ( MRI ) report applicable . For specific event capture form . Individuals continue follow every 3 month outcome via telephone contact determine whether resolution and/or recurrence occur change medical therapy . At resolution event , patient return 6 month follow . Serum plasma also re-collected time first outcome case exposure baseline sample control ( biologics without paradoxical immune reaction ) . Serum plasma collect time event diagnosis , possible ( within 2 month ) . If possible , blood draw `` miss '' circumstance patient see clinic window . Timeline study contact : The top timeline individual develop event , baseline in-person consent serum collection , contact every 6 month telephone contact visit follow visit time routine clinic follow-up . The bottom line someone develop event , close follow-up event resolution , repeat serum collection . Contacts therefore range 3-6 month , vast majority follow 6 month interval .</detailed_description>
