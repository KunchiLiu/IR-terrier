	<brief_summary>Tuberculosis ( TB ) global challenge increase epidemic multi-drug resistant ( MDR ) -TB restrict treatment option . This call research new immune-modulating treatment strategy strengthen patient immune system well fight TB bacteria . The pro-inflammatory , still immunosuppressive mediator prostaglandin E2 ( PGE2 ) produce cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) inflame infected tissue . Studies human animal model show COX-2 inhibitor ( COX-2i ) improve immune system strengthen vaccine response . Hypothesis 1 . A hyperactive COX-2/PGE2 signal system active TB cause down-regulated immune response favour TB survival , abrogate COX-2i . 2 . TB-specific immunisation target antigen present therapeutic TB vaccine enhance COX-2i improve immune-mediated host clearance TB . 3 . Combinations COX-2i therapeutic TB vaccine conventional anti-TB chemotherapy offer new treatment modality TB , include MDR/XDR-TB . Approach test hypothesis 1 . Study design : 4-arm , open randomize clinical intervention trial patient start treatment active TB specialize Norwegian TB centre two arm receive COX-2i etoricoxib without TB vaccine , one arm vaccine last arm serve control receive standard anti-TB therapy . For safety precaution , patient bear sensitive TB strain include study arm sequentially introduce . 2 . In mouse model examine detail effect reversion chronic inflammation COX-2i locally tissue interplay TB vaccine response , immune regulation , correlate protection survival well-characterized model TB-exposed mouse .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Therapeutic Vaccination Immune Modulation - New Treatment Strategies MDR Tuberculosis Pandemic</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The hypothesis treat TB patient therapeutic TB vaccine COX-2 inhibiting drug addition standard antibiotic TB therapy improve patient immune system boost TB vaccine response . The project provide safety immunogenicity data Norwegian phase 1 clinical trial therapeutic TB vaccine candidate H56 : IC31 COX-2i etoricoxib give TB patient together standard TB antibiotic . The investigator also perform exploratory in-depth study immune regulatory mechanism try identify biomarkers efficacy treatment human parallel mouse model . These result may optimize therapeutic strategy prepare large clinical trial finally contribute new treatment option MDR-TB . Objectives : - Study safety tolerability etoricoxib give 20 week ( day 0-140 ) alone combination therapeutic TB vaccine H56 : IC31 give two immunization day 84 day 140 patient active TB disease treat conventional 26-week anti-TB chemotherapy . - Study immune effect etoricoxib give 20 week ( day 0-140 ) immune regulation TB vaccine ( H56 : IC31 ) immunogenicity patient active TB disease treat conventional 26-week anti-TB chemotherapy .</detailed_description>
