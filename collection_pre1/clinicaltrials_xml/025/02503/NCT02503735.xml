	<brief_title>Effect Harvoni Proteinuria Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate ( eGFR ) Hepatitis C ( HCV ) Associated Chronic Kidney Disease ( CKD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator hypothesize patient early stage ( 1-3 ) CKD cause HCV infection significantly improve proteinuria eGFR viral eradication 12 week treatment Harvoni ( LDV/SOF ) . This trial data serve basis support study LDV/SOF patient early CKD . Slowing progression CKD critical goal , increase incidence prevalence advance CKD ESRD ( end stage renal disease ) place significant health burden patient tremendous cost health-care system .</detailed_description>
