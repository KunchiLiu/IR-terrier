	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety recommend phase II dose ( RP2D ) MLN0128 ( TORC1/2 inhibitor INK128 ) combination AZD9291 ( EGFR inhibitor AZD9291 ) patient advance epidermal growth factor receptor mutation positive ( EGFRm ) non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . ( Dose escalation phase ) II . To evaluate safety preliminary efficacy MLN0128 combination AZD9291 patient advance EGFRm NSCLC negative resistance mutation T790M ( T790M negative [ - ] ) . ( Dose expansion phase ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate pharmacokinetic profile MLN0128 combination AZD9291 . II . To evaluate response rate , disease control rate progression free survival combination . III . To explore biomarkers response resistance combination study baseline biopsy , resistance biopsy , serial plasma deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) specimens . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study TORC1/2 inhibitor INK128 . Patients receive TORC1/2 inhibitor INK128 orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 15 , 17 , 19 , 22 , 24 , 26 ( day 1 omit course 1 ) . Patients also receive EGFR inhibitor AZD9291 PO QD day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day , every 8 week thereafter .</detailed_description>
