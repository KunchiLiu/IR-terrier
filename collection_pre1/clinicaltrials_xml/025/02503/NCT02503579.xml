	<brief_title>The Role Brain-derived Neurotropic Factor Relationship Between Executive Function Physical Training</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nowadays child get inactive participate le sport daily physical activity . Previous study show good physical fitness associate improved cognitive function . While physical active , physiological change take place brain . Brain-derived neurotropic factor one neurotropins play crucial role process . Executive function cognitive process responsible organize control goal-directed action . These function develop childhood play important role daily- school functioning . This doctoral thesis aim identify role Brain-derived neurotropic factor relationship physical fitness/activity executive function child . In first trail effect physical fitness physical training executive functioning level Brain-derived neurotropic factor study . In second trail research question expand investigating relation child Autism Spectrum Disorder , Development Coordination Disorder , Attention Hyperactive Disorder . Protocol trail 1 : The include ( typically develop ) child randomize stratified level physical fitness 2 group : intervention group control group . The intervention group receive physical activity training 2 time week 8 week . The control group receive additional training . At begin end training period intervention control group test physical fitness level executive functioning . Protocol trail 2 : Identical protocol trail 1 except participant child Autism Spectrum Disorder , Development Coordination Disorder , Attention Hyperactive Disorder stead typically develop child .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Trail 1 typically develop child child : executive function , neurological cognitive disorder Trail 2 Inclusion criterion : typically develop child ( control ) child Developmental Coordination disorder , Attention deficit disorder Autism Spectrum disorder Exclusion criterion : Children neurological cognitive disorder</criteria>
