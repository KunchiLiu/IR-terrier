	<brief_summary>Patients large enough defect knee cartilage sometimes undergo surgery transplant donor cartilage tissue defect attempt repair knee . The donor cartilage tissue must fully test disease contamination place patient . This time , along time need coordinate surgery transport tissue hospital , substantial . Cartilage tissue last long outside body fresh tissue , likely patient receive transplant heal well . The MOPS develop preserve cartilage tissue well currently standard preservation system able . Patients enrol study receive cartilage tissue store MOPS instead currently standard preservation system . Their surgical procedure change perform per usual . The patient follow period two year progress assess use survey heal integration transplant tissue assess use diagnostic imaging blood urine sample .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Assessment Missouri Osteochondral Allograft Preservation System - MOPS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients enrol study receive osteochondral allograft tissue store MOPS instead currently standard preservation system ( culture medium 4 degree Celsius ) . This difference surgical procedure enrol patient non-study patient . Enrolled patient undergo grafting procedure normally would enrol study . They also receive care non-study patient . Enrolled patient , however , ask fill survey health , activity level , level pain , general quality life ( IKDC , Tegner , PROMIS survey ) pre-operative visit post-operative visit 3 month , 6 month , 12 month , 24 month surgery . They also ask provide blood urine sample pre-operative visit , day surgery , post-operative visit 6 week , 3 month , 6 month , 12 month , 24 month surgery . Also , non-standard care MRI take 12 month surgery . Finally , diagnostic image do part standard care also review investigator . No additional diagnostic image take place outside non-standard care MRI 12 month surgery ; image review simply take advantage diagnostic imaging would available even non-study patient . The survey assess progress patient function general well-being . The blood urine sample , well MRI ass heal integration osteochondral allograft .</detailed_description>
