	<brief_title>Latent Iron Deficiency Birth Influences Auditory Neural Maturation Late Preterm Term Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Iron essential nutrient brain development . During early human development , iron require multiple neurodevelopmental process . To meet iron requirement develop brain , active transfer iron occur across placenta last trimester pregnancy therefore term infant iron replete status birth . However , maternal iron deficiency pregnancy , global health problem , negatively affect fetal iron status . In addition , prematurity , maternal diabetes mellitus , preeclampsia , maternal smoking , intrauterine growth restriction pregnancy also associate decrease iron transfer fetus often leading utero iron deficiency . Cord serum ferritin ( SF ) level birth provide good measurement fetal tissue iron storage concentration therefore often used evaluate utero iron status . The absolute interpeak latency auditory brainstem evoke response ( ABR ) often used surrogate outcome measure neural maturation neonate . The absolute latency ABR wave interpeak latency ( IPL , I-III , III-V , I-V ) influence degree myelination , neuronal development , synaptic function , axonal growth auditory nervous system . The absolute latency IPL decrease auditory neural system mature age neonate . Although iron essential auditory neural maturation perinatal period , paucity data regard concomitant effect utero iron deficiency auditory neural maturation late preterm term infant . The present prospective study plan objective determine association utero iron deficiency evaluate cord ferritin auditory neural maturation birth â‰¥ 34 week GA infant .</detailed_description>
