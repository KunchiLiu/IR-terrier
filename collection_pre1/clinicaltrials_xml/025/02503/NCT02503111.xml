	<brief_summary>Human papillomavirus ( HPV ) common sexually transmitted infection worldwide . Infection certain high-risk oncogenic type HPV ( HR-HPV ) major cause several cancer men , notably squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) anal canal . Rates anal infection HR-HPV strain resultant high-grade anal dysplasia anal cancer much high men sex men ( MSM ) general population . Co-infection human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) amplify burden , make rate anal SCC HIV-positive MSM high historic rate cervical cancer prior adoption routine cervical cytology screen . Despite alarm statistic , establish protocol optimal screen treatment anal HPV cancer precursor , widespread rollout organize screening program anywhere Canada . Further , HPV directly cause significant disease men , grow epidemiologic evidence HPV infection may enhance sexual transmission HIV . These significant knowledge gap translate fundamental deficiency care HIV-positive MSM . The HPV Screening Vaccine Evaluation MSM ( HPV-SAVE ) study team recruit large group MSM carry number different study . One key component recruitment entail mail invitation educational material invitational package subject order determine would interested anal cancer screen . In way , investigator reveal factor important acceptance screening . The HPV-SAVE team bring together community internationally-recognized expert HPV HIV disease mucosal immunology , good define optimal approach primary secondary prevention treatment HPV-associated anal disease among HIV-positive MSM , explore biological mechanistic evidence regard potential role HPV co-factor HIV transmission . This yield critical information lead improvement health MSM , provide foundation build , large-scale screening treatment trial national level .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Since 1990s , combination antiretroviral therapy ( cART ) markedly reduce HIV-related opportunistic infection mortality , increase life expectancy people live HIV . While AIDS-defining malignancy decline non-AIDS defining malignancy continue high rate HIV-infected person general population . Amongst cancer associate HPV responsible 90 % SCC anal canal . The incidence anal SCC increase cART era , , urgent need find effective way prevent anal SCC living HIV . This include screening anal cancer precursor ablative treatment lesion . Though infrequent rate 1 per 100 000 , anal SCC rise general population . It occur significantly high rate HIV-positive MSM estimate rate 60 160 per 100 000 . Rates anal cancer among HIV infect MSM comparable rate cervical cancer woman prior adoption routine screen cervical dysplasia . Anal cancer share many similarity cervical cancer . Of &gt; 170 HPV type , anal cancer ( cervical cancer ) cause two high-risk HPV type : 16 18 responsible 66 % 5 % anal cancer , respectively . HPV lesion cause low-risk type include genital wart , 90 % cause HPV type 6 11 . Prevention strategy anal cancer emerge analogous strategy use cervical cancer screening , aim identify precursor lesion remove progression cancer . Screening detection rely combination anal cytology ( Pap smear ) , anal HPV detection high-resolution anoscopy ( HRA ) . Despite clear evidence indicate benefit screen treatment procedure cervical cancer screening , rigorous study assess strategy anal cancer prevention men woman . Anal SCC similar histologically cervical cancer , precancerous lesion anus ( AIN ) cervix ( cervical intraepithelial neoplasia [ CIN ] ) grade similarly ( normal , low-grade [ AIN- CIN-1 ] , high-grade [ AIN- CIN-2 3 ] , SCC ) . Rates progression high-grade dysplasia HIV-infected MSM around 15 % , mean follow-up period 2 5 year . In HIV-uninfected person , anal cancer detection earlier stage improve survival . Thus , early cancer detection HIV-infected patient may also beneficial . Using HRA , anal mucosa visualize magnification plastic anoscope application acetic acid Lugol 's iodine . Abnormal-appearing area biopsied histologic AIN 2/3 detect treatment generally , always , offer . For anal dysplasia , treatment surgery , infrared coagulation ( IRC ) electrocautery ( EC ) topical therapy ( e.g . trichloroacetic acid , TCA ) evaluate case series . Similarly , give high recurrence rate CIN woman HIV 65 % arguably radical therapy , long-term , controlled trial ablative therapy still need HIV-infected MSM high-grade AIN . There preliminary evidence HPV immunization may reduce likelihood recurrent high-grade anal lesion MSM ablative therapy . These finding need confirmation . In 2004 , investigator initiate Toronto Research Anal Cancer Evaluation ( TRACE ) study evaluate performance characteristic anal cytology anal HPV test detection anal cancer precursor 401 HIV-infected MSM . Overall , information glean large cohort demonstrate burden HPV disease high HIV-positive MSM , anal Pap smear insensitive tool rely diagnosis . Due poor test performance anal cytology single , primary screen test , use result widespread uptake screening . Exploration potential benefit utility screen test HPV-DNA testing , perhaps conjunction anal cytology , need . Even though number centre United States , Canada , Europe United Kingdom report study anal cancer screening test , anal cancer screen implement organized fashion high-risk population jurisdiction . In consider organize anal cancer screen MSM , would logical extrapolate algorithm use organized cervical cancer screen program ( e.g . screen use cytology proceed aggressive intervention [ i.e . HRA ] high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion ( HSIL ) present ) apply anal cancer screening . The currently propose study aim address several key knowledge gap follow two primary objective : ( 1 ) systematically compare ablative therapy versus intensive observation alone outcomes relate high-grade anal dysplasia ; ( 2 ) good define evidence-based criterion anal cancer screen use anal cytology HPV test validation algorithm . Overall aim study include : - Aim # 1 : To assess knowledge , attitude regard HPV , anal cancer , HPV vaccination , anal cancer screen determine acceptability vaccination screen among HIV-positive MSM . - Aim # 2 : To evaluate acceptance rate HIV-positive MSM invitation anal cancer screen include educational brochure invitational package . - Aim # 3 : To optimize decision make HIV-positive MSM send high resolution endoscopy ( HRA ) . - Aim # 4 : To compare efficacy , safety , tolerability ablative therapy anal dysplasia versus observation alone cohort HIV-positive MSM high-grade anal dysplasia . - Aim # 5 : To elucidate role play anal HPV infection mucosal immune determinant HIV transmission susceptibility MSM .</detailed_description>
