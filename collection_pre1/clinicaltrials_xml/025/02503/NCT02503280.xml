	<brief_summary>Before initiate full randomize study , Pilot Safety Phase perform . In phase composition cell administer via Biosense Webster MyoStar NOGA Injection Catheter System test . The randomized portion study conduct full review safety data pilot Phase Data safety monitor board . Following Pilot Phase five ( 5 ) Fifty ( 50 ) patient schedule undergo cardiac catheterization meeting inclusion/exclusion criterion evaluate baseline . Patients randomize 2:2:1 ratio one three Treatment Strategies .</brief_summary>
