	<brief_summary>This randomized phase I trial study side effect best dose selumetinib give together paclitaxel second line therapy treat patient stage IIIB-IV non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . Selumetinib may stop slow growth tumor cell block protein call mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MEK ) need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , paclitaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving selumetinib together paclitaxel may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety tolerability three pre-planned arm continuous , intermittent , pulsatile selumetinib paclitaxel second-line treatment patient stage IIIB IV NSCLC . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine preliminary clinical response continuous , intermittent , pulsatile selumetinib paclitaxel second-line treatment patient stage IIIB IV NSCLC . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To characterize pharmacokinetics ( PK ) selumetinib patient population . II . To determine progression-free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) patient treat selumetinib/paclitaxel . III . To assess correlation cell-free DNA ( cfDNA ) molecular feature blood molecular feature pathways biopsy sample , use surrogate measure tumor response duration response evaluate primary secondary objective . OUTLINE : This dose-finding study selumetinib . The goal find dose dose schedule effective population . Patients randomize 1 3 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive selumetinib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-21 paclitaxel intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 8 . ARM II : Patients receive selumetinib PO BID day 1-5 , 8-12 , 15-19 paclitaxel Arm I . ARM III : Patients receive selumetinib PO BID day 1-3 , 8-10 , 15-17 paclitaxel Arm I . In three arm , treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients experience clinical benefit study treatment may continue treatment base principal investigator ( PI ) approval patient-by-patient basis . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day , every 8 week 12 month , every 3 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
