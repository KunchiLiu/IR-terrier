	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety tolerability HMPL-523 administer patient relapsed refractory Hematologic Malignancies To determine maximum tolerate dosage/recommended phase 2 dosage characterize dose limited toxicity associate HMPL-523 administer patient relapsed refractory Hematologic Malignancies</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study HMPL-523 Relapsed Refractory Hematologic Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There two stage study : dose-escalation stage ( stage 1 ) dose-expansion stage ( stage 2 ) . Dose-escalation stage ( stage 1 ) The conventional 3+3 design ( 3 patient per dose cohort , potential add additional 3 patient cohort evaluate toxicity ) apply dose escalation maximum tolerated dosage determination . Approximately 18 27 evaluable patient enrol . The actual number patient depend dose limited toxicity situation well maximum tolerated dosage reach stage . Dosing include QD BID cohorts . A cycle study treatment define 28 day continuous dose . Dose-expansion stage ( stage 2 ) This phase evaluate safety , pharmacokinetics anti-tumor activity HMPL-523 recommend phase 2 dosage approximately 20patients relapse refractory Hematologic Malignancies . In stage , approximately 20 patient B-cell Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphomas Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia enrol recommend phase 2 dosage start dose . The tumor type expansion stage restrict Chronic lymphocytic leukemia/ small lymphocytic lymphoma ( CLL/SLL ) , Mantle cell lymphoma ( MCL ) , Follicular Lymphoma ( FL ) , Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) Waldenstrom 's macroglobulinemia ( WM ) Subjects receive HMPL-523 every 28-day treatment cycle disease progression , death , intolerable toxicity , whichever come first .</detailed_description>
