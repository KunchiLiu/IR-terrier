	<brief_summary>The concurrent performance two task , i.e. , dual tasking ( DT ) , common ubiquitous every day phenomenon . For example , people frequently walk talk cellphone drive talk passenger . Often , performance one simultaneously perform task may deteriorate another task carry time , even healthy young adult . This reduction performance refer DT deficit DT cost typically much high patient Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) young adult age-matched control . In PD , DT cost impairs gait pattern , manifest , example , increase gait variability , exacerbate instability fall risk . In proposed study , would evaluate effect tDCS dual task performance follow tDCS . The researcher expect stimulation Pre Frontal Cortex ( PFC ) ( use tDCS ) increase DT performance prefrontal activation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>tDCS intervention : Noninvasive tDCS deliver study personnel uninvolved study procedure . In study use battery-driven electrical stimulator . Stimulation sham condition perform base previous study . Briefly , anode place PFC cathode right supraorbital region . The real tDCS condition consist 20 min continuous stimulation target intensity 1.5 mA . This amount stimulation safe healthy young old adult show induce acute beneficial change cortical excitability cognitive function . For sham condition , inactive stimulation protocol would follow , compare 'off-target ' active protocol , order minimize participant risk . After session , subject complete side effect questionnaire . The efficacy tDCS blinding also assess final session , ask subject judge whether received real sham tDCS , well certainty judgment . Pre- post-tDCS assessment include : fMRI : All MR image acquire 3.0 T scanner use 8-channel head coil . T1-weighted brain volume ( BRAVO ) acquisition evaluate gray matter ( GM ) volume thickness , marker brain atrophy . This sequence measure ratio GM within PFC overall GM , use quantify level activation within PFC . T2* echo planner image acquisition use DT paradigms include intrinsic functional connectivity . Intrinsic connectivity examine subject engage particular task request lie still eye open ( i.e. , rest state ) . To examine task relate change versus generalize pattern DT activation , type cognitive task nature motor task different task . The researcher specifically examine contribution secondary task involve work memory ( arithmetic processing vs. attention ) , conflict monitoring , motor planning DT related activation . fNIRS : fNIRS use investigate role frontal lobe DT walking affect tDCS [ Mirelman et al . 2014 ] . The fNIRS system ( Oxymon MKIII ; Artinis Medical Systems ) consist flexible circuit board carry near-infrared light source detector . The fNIRS source detector pair place left ( Fp1 ) right ( Fp2 ) frontal cortex region forehead , previously report . Gait assessment : Gait parameter include spatial temporal parameter obtain use body fix wearable sensor ( accelerometer gyroscope ) [ Weiss et al . 2015 ; Ben et al . 2015 ] . Parameters include ( limited ) gait speed , stride length stride time well rhythmicity measure stride stride variability gait regularity . The UPDRS , fall history fear fall also assess ( e.g. , Falls Efficacy Scale International , FES-I ) characterize cohort explore possible confounds . Cognitive assessment : A detailed computerized cognitive battery use extensively TASMC PD cohorts [ Dwolatzky et al . 2003 ; Hausdorff et al . 2006 ; Springer et al . 2006 ; Yogev et al . 2005 ; Aarsland et al . 2003 ] quantify several cognitive domain include work memory , executive function , verbal function , problem solving , global cognitive score , attention . Sample size : Based effect tDCS DT walk outcome cohort [ Leite et al . 2014 ; Zhou et al . 2014 ] , research group consider conservative change 15 % HbO2 level tDCS , compare sham , 18 subject per group provide &gt; 80 % power . In order allow potential inter-subject variability address secondary question ( e.g. , effect disease severity ) , would assess 30 participant group . Data collection : A research assistant assist participant fill electronic questionnaire conduct non electronic one ( would later transcribe excel sheet research assistant ) . A post-doc fellow PhD student run MRI scan tDCS session together one-two research assistant . The participant receive reminder ( phone email ) one day prior session . Participation monitor research assistant .</detailed_description>
