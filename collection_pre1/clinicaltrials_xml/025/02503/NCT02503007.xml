	<brief_title>Effects 14-days HMB-free Acid Changes Muscle During 4-days Survival Training</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sustained high intensity activity often accompany sleep nutrient deprivation common characteristic survival training . Survival training requirement preparation pilot , learn evasion survival skill may need avoid capture situation bail plane . The physiological stress associated nature operation often result significant decrement lean body mass , muscle size muscle endurance power . During sudden evacuation aircraft pilot take small survival bag . There limit possibly put bag . However , ability provide dietary supplement specifically target muscle may provide important resource maintain muscle mass performance . Thus , purpose study determine efficacy 14 day HMB-FA ingestion maintain muscle architecture muscle performance 4-days survival training . In addition , anabolic catabolic marker stress , inflammation muscle damage assess .</detailed_description>
