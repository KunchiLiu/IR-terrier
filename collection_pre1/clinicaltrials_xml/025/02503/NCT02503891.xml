	<detailed_description>The procedure involve removal diseased part joint , damage cartilage adjacent bone , replace artificial part closely resemble structure and/or function remove native part . The artificial part fit onto reshape bone fix either bone cement ( e.g. , polymethylmethacrylate ) press fit part ( cement ) , self-anchorage bone ingrowth porous surface ( cementless ) . The design artificial part may include stem , keel peg , fit onto medullary canal bone hole pre-prepared bone . An artificial part may fit loosely fix bone cement , press-fit self- anchorage include extendible anchor retract upon placement extend thereafter secure implant place . Following fixation component , joint reduce soft tissue tension appropriately checked reassure stability joint . The MP-1™ acetabular liner tapper lock acetabular metal shell resurface acetabular socket cementless total hip replacement .
