	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To establish safety , tolerability , maximum tolerate dose combination onalespib ( Hsp90 inhibitor AT13387 ) AT7519M ( CDKI AT7519 ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine pharmacokinetics combination onalespib AT7519M . II . To assess pharmacodynamic effect combination onalespib AT7519M HSP70 expression modulation HSP90 client proteins peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) plasma . III . To observe record anti-tumor activity . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive Hsp90 inhibitor AT13387 intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour day 1 4 ( course 0 ) . Patients receive Hsp90 inhibitor AT13387 IV 1 hour CDKI AT7519 IV 1 hour day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 ( course 1 subsequent course thereafter ) . Courses repeat every 21 day ( 7 day course 0 ) absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
