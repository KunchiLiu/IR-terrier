	<detailed_description>Radiotherapy establish effective method treat cancer , negative side effect healthy tissue also expose radiation . In case cervical cancer , bladder , small bowel , bone marrow often irradiate , result short-term long-term side effect . There sophisticated radiation delivery technique ( know IMRT VMAT ) capable administer radiation dose precise control manner intend target irradiate healthy tissue spar . However , way sophisticated radiation delivery method work cervical cancer localise uterus prior radiotherapy treatment lineup radiation beam target ensure . The uterus relatively mobile organ , different position within body depend patient position , bladder volume , tumour site , etc . Currently , unable take advantage sophisticated radiation delivery technique reliable way see uterus . Ultrasound promising way overcome problem . Ultrasound non-ionising , good soft-tissue contrast , easily incorporate radiation treatment room . We wish establish feasibility accuracy localise outline uterus ultrasound image . This enable u determine whether ultrasound good option ensure correct patient position prior radiotherapy cervical cancer patient .</detailed_description>
