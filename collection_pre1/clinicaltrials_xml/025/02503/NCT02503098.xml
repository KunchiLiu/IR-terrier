	<detailed_description>Eating Disorders ( ED ) common serious psychological disorder . Anorexia Nervosa ( AN ) prevalence estimate 0.48 % 0.70 % among young female . Bulimia Nervosa ( BN ) serious mental health problem , prevalence 1-2 % young woman clinically significant bulimic behavior occur additional 2-3 % . There significant barrier access evidence-based treatment current model individual psychotherapy likely never meet enormous need psychological service ED . Unfortunately , even treatment , rate recovery modest best perform treatment achieve remission 50 % case relapse rate high , especially ED become chronic . It widely acknowledge major shift intervention practice need smartphone apps almost certainly play role due reach breadth functionality . As first commercially available smartphone app EDs , Recovery Record ( RR ) establish wide reach user acceptability . The app provide user meal ED symptom self-monitoring coping skill strategies evidence-based CBT format . Preliminary pilot data suggest proportion RR user , use RR associate clinically significant symptom reduction . However , limitation current app `` one-size-fits-all '' product account heterogeneity ED symptom . Genetic , personality neurocognitive data support distinct cluster ED presentation also differ accord response treatment , course outcome . Pilot data confirm clinical response RR homogenous across group extent cognitive distortion potent factor predict outcome . There considerable opportunity increase RR 's effectiveness across range ED symptoms behavior create adaptive tailor content focus remediation cognitive distortion . During Phase 1 study screen algorithm validate unseen , prospective test dataset approximately 2,000 user . All candidate predictor variable enter Signal Detection Analysis confirm sensitivity specificity screen . Informed resultant algorithm , adaptive content develop target ED-specific cognitive distortion . To evaluate acceptability , adapt content pilot approximately 200 individual period one month . Participant feedback utilization data inform content acceptability feasibility . By end first phase tailor content acceptable individual specific symptom presentation develop . Phase 2 focus evaluation whether adaptive app offering tailor content address eat related cognitive distortion step way outperform current standard app . The adaptive content integrate new , dynamic version app ( RR-A ) evaluate current app ( RR-S ) . Approximately 5,000 register user RR randomize receive either RR augment target content ( RR-A ) , RR current standard format ( RR-S ) two-month period . Outcome data measure baseline , one month , end treatment , six-month follow-up . At end study period predict resultant evidence-based product demonstrate ability bring clinically significant reduction symptom user current app , thus potential make substantial public health impact .</detailed_description>
