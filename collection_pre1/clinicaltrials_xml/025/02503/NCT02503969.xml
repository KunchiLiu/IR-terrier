	<detailed_description>Linkage datasets ethical issue . The South Yorkshire Cohort ( SYC ) data ( include patient identifier ) hold Clinical Trials Research Unit ( CTRU ) University Sheffield , whilst Bowel Cancer Screening Programme ( BCSP ) data hold NHS Cancer Screening Programmes ( part Public Health England ) . Linkage base subset respondent SYC give consent SYC researcher look NHS health record , eligible invited colorectal cancer ( CRC ) screening . The propose method linkage follow : - For respondent give consent , CTRU shall send NHS number SYC study ID BCSP . - Using NHS number , BCSP shall extract data individual invite screening , whether individual accept screening . - The BCSP shall send screen data along SYC study ID CTRU . NHS number shall include data send BCSP ( word pseudo-anonymised ) . - The CTRU shall use pseudo-ID link screen programme data SYC data . A pseudo-anonymised dataset shall release research team . In way , patient-identifiable data BCSP would receive data already hold ( NHS number ) , whilst CTRU would receive additional patient-identifiable data . It also stress research team undertaking project would access patient-identifiable data stage project . Data use . The following data shall use within project : • Exposure variable . The exposure variables presence long-standing condition . These collect within SYC self-reported long-standing condition . Twelve name condition record , along `` '' condition , include free-text allow respondent state condition . These condition ( prevalence amongst preliminary sample people age 60 74 SYC ) : Depression ( 8 % ) , Anxiety ( 10 % ) , Fatigue ( 19 % ) , Pain ( 28 % ) , Insomnia ( 8 % ) , Diabetes ( 10 % ) , Breathing problem ( 13 % ) , High blood pressure ( 31 % ) , Heart disease ( 10 % ) , Osteoarthritis ( 16 % ) , Stroke ( 3 % ) , Cancer ( 5 % ) Other ( 29 % ) . All long-standing condition shall consider , exception cancer ( include CRC , patient eligible screen ) free-text description ( shall analyse `` '' ) . - Outcome variable . The outcome variable individual attend CRC screen . This link SYC data use data supply National Bowel Cancer Screening Programme . It note CRC screen relates first time individual screen ( prevalent screening ) . The main analysis look individual CRC screen ( irrespective number invitation screen sent ) . Depending available evidence , secondary analysis would consider outcome variable 'individual accept CRC screen refuse initial invitation CRC screening . ' - Confounding variable . The following potentially-confounding variable shall assess : Age , gender , ethnicity , high level education , level physical exercise , smoking status , alcohol consumption , IMD deprivation score . - Additional descriptive variable . The following variable use within statistical model , shall include perform descriptive comparison individual attend screen attend screening : self-reported EQ-5D summary score , self-reported healthcare use last 3 month ( include 22 name category , anticipate due small number need group . Possible grouping consider : Accident emergency ( A &amp; E ) , Hospital use ( exclude A &amp; E ) , Health-carer : GP , Health-carer : Nurse , Other health-carers , Other carers , Alternative therapist . Statistical analysis . The statistical analysis shall include follow section : • Initial exploratory analysis . This initial analysis shall provide overview available data , highlight issue may need address within statistical modelling . A descriptive analysis shall compare characteristic people attend CRC screen attend . This comparison include exposure variable , confound variable additional descriptive variable ( detailed previous section ) . Comparisons test statistical significance , caveat specific difference hypothesise priori , result p-values interpret caution . T-tests use compare continuous variable , Fisher 's exact test use compare binary variable , Kruskal-Wallis test use compare ordinal variable . Any p-values less 5 % take indicate statistically significant association . In addition descriptive analysis , functional form association continuous variable outcome shall visually assess use smooth method . If non-linear functional form indicate use non-linear function ( fractional polynomial , natural spline ) shall consider . - Handling miss data . The amount miss data shall determine strategy employ ( Harrell , 2001 ) . If total proportion people miss data less 5 % single imputation miss value shall carry . Otherwise , multiple imputation miss value shall carry . - Statistical modelling . Screening uptake rate CRC shall analyse use logistic regression , patient demographic , socioeconomic status , lifestyle factor morbidity potentially explanatory variable . The primary interest morbidity affect uptake rate , particular interest mental morbidity ( depression anxiety measure SYC ) . Because , interaction two mental morbidity shall consider . To examine association mental morbidity uptake , see variable influence association , series model shall present : - Model 1 ( univariate-model ) : shall include long-standing condition ( exposure variable ) independent variable . - Model 2 ( demographics-adjusted model ) : shall include independent variable Model 1 , along demographic variable ( age , gender ethnicity ) . - Model 3 ( full model ) : shall include variable consider study . Interactions shall consider . - Model 4 ( exploratory model ) : shall apply subset-selection Model 3 ( backwards-stepwise , probability-to-remove 0.05 ) . Interactions shall consider apply subset-selection . The purpose display series model show un-adjusted association morbidity screen uptake , highlight degree association mediate patient characteristic . A distinction make 'intrinsic ' characteristic ( age , gender ethnicity ) , ( generally ) beyond person 's control change , remain characteristic , over-which person control Power calculation . Power analyse conduct use G*Power 3.1.9 . The required sample size detect significant effect pre-specified variable calculate . For analysis alpha level 5 % two-tailed test use . There number additional factor need estimate chosen : - Required power : value 95 % 80 % use . - Odds ratio : value 1.2 3 test . - Probability uptake amongst without morbidity : overall uptake 47 % observed 2008 2011 BCSP use . - Degree correlation amongst potentially explanatory variable : value 20 % 40 % test ( denote 'R2 ' table ) . - Prevalence pre-specified variable : value 8 % use , correspond prevalence depression preliminary analysis SYC data . In analysis , 74 % sample morbidity , average 1.8 long-term condition per person . Table 1 : Sample size require function power , correlation , odds ratio . Power = 80 % Power = 95 % Odds Ratio R2 = 0.2 R2 = 0.4 R2 = 0.2 R2 = 0.4 1.2 16,066 21,422 26,605 35,473 1.3 7,780 10,373 12,876 17,168 1.4 4,751 6,335 7,857 10,476 1.5 3,292 4,389 5,437 7,249 1.6 2,466 3,289 4,069 5,425 1.8 1,603 2,137 2,637 3,516 2.0 1,174 1,566 1,925 2,567 2.2 926 1,234 1,513 2,017 2.4 767 1,022 1,248 1,665 2.6 658 877 1,067 1,422 2.8 579 772 935 1,247 3.0 519 693 837 1,116 The sample size available expect approximately 7,500 indicate odds ratio 1.4 great detect 80 % power , whilst odds ratio 1.5 great detect 95 % power . An example change uptake rate relate odds ratio 1.5 would decrease uptake 60 % 57 % . Further example present Table 2 . Table 2 : Decreases uptake rate corresponding odds ratio 1.5 Uptake rate group 1 : 90 % 80 % 70 % 60 % Uptake rate group 2 : 81 % 72 % 64 % 57 % An alternative method estimate sample size also test ( Campbell , Julious , Altman 1996 ) . This use publish table estimate sample size ( per group ) require identify pre-specified difference two proportion 5 % significance level 80 % power . The group size adjust take account difference group size . For example , group depression represent 8 % total population , detect difference uptake 65 % amongst people without depression 60 % amongst people depression , overall sample size 425 require , 34 would need depression 391 would depression . The overall sample size required range difference uptake rate present Table 3 ( uptake rate multiples 5 % value use publish table ) . Table 3 : Sample size require detect pre-specified difference uptake . Uptake group A Uptake group B Total sample size 60 % 55 % 1 188 65 % 60 % 425 70 % 65 % 213 75 % 70 % 138 * Assuming comparison people depression ( prevalence 8 % , correspond group B ) without depression .</detailed_description>
