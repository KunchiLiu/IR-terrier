	<brief_title>Stanford Center Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Stanford Center Back Pain establishes collaborative , multidisciplinary research program investigate CAM intervention treatment chronic low back pain ( CLBP ) . The investigator ' overall goal characterize share distinct mechanism four CAM intervention translate investigator ' finding tailor effective treatment CLBP . CLBP highly prevalent difficult-to-treat condition many patient seek CAM therapy . Basic science reveal abnormality central pain modulatory emotion regulatory system play crucial role CLBP . What clear CAM therapy alter function brain system involve chronic pain . The Stanford Center Back Pain aim fill gap conduct 3 project , aim elucidate mechanisms underlying different CAM therapy CLBP . Project 1 focus promise novel alternative therapy CLBP real-time fMRI neurofeedback train patient control specific neural process lead improvement pain . Project 2 characterize pain modulatory emotion regulatory effect mindfulness base stress reduction cognitive behavioral therapy CLBP . Project 3 characterize psychophysical neuroimaging base neural mechanism underlie verum placebo acupuncture . The Stanford Center Back Pain provide optimal collaboration synergy within multidisciplinary framework identify mechanism CAM therapy CLBP eventually translate enhance clinical care CLBP .</detailed_description>
