	<detailed_description>The efficacy punctal dilatation insertion perforate punctal plugs management acquire punctal stenosis due allergic conjunctivitis . Acquired punctal stenosis condition external opening lacrimal canaliculus narrow occlude due chronic inflammation fibrosis . This condition rare cause symptomatic epiphora , incidence may higher patient chronic blepharitis , treat various topical medication , include antihypertensive agent , especially patient treated taxanes cancer . The incidence punctal stenosis still unknown , report rate range 8 % 54.3 % , depend setting , demographic , probably interob¬server variability . Nevertheless , literature suggest pathology give special consideration assess tear patient , may involve easy surgical solution patient obstruction distal lacrimal system . Recently many oculoplastic surgeon encounter young patient ( usually females ) punctual stenosis sign allergic conjunctivitis reflex tear . In case , treatment allergic conjunctivitis improve tearing . Treatment punctoplasty mini- Monoka stent improve condition short term . However , many patient experience recurrence epiphora long term . There uniform clinical guideline treatment disease . A method currently use management punctal stenosis . The common use punctoplasty intubation minimonoka stent . Substantial experience minor surgical snip procedure would suggest give preference utilization treatment disease clinic . The simple method involve use perforate punctal plug , reversible simple procedure apply office setting . Silicon perforate plug insert punctual dilatation topical anesthesia lacrimal punctum order maintain patent tear drain nasolacrimal sac . The procedure simple usually pain free . After procedure topical steroid antibiotic prescribe one week . Plugs extract two month period outpatient clinic . Unfortunately , evidence efficacy procedure acquire punctual stenosis scarce . One retrospective series 44 eye 26 patient treated dilation placement perforate punctal plug acquire punctal stenosis , success rate 84.1 % ( 37 44 eye ) cessation epiphora . The plug extract 2 month . Most case partial punctal stenosis . Associated eyelid laxity detect 14 eye , eight underwent lateral tarsal strip procedure prior plug implantation . The mean follow-up period 19 month . Failures due either restenosis horizontal eyelid laxity . Another study evaluate use perforate punctual plug patient acquire punctual stenosis , 20 patient total . This study show 85 % success rate total . Patients procedure fail usually older likely blepharitis . Although perforated punctal plug attractive non¬surgical tool management acquire punctal stenosis , long-term result procedure role treat punctal stenosis require prospective large clinical trial . Study design We intend perform prospective clinical trial ass efficacy perforate punctual plug treat acquire punctual stenosis . Since patient previously assign treatment Crawford tube insertion , patient group act comparison group study . Adult , consent patient recruit ophthalmology outpatient clinic Rabin Medical Center . Punctal plug insert outpatient clinic duration two month . Plug insertion perform topical anesthesia careful dilation lacrimal punctum . Patients prescribed topical steroid antibiotic one week period follow plug insertion procedure . Punctal plug remove two month treatment period . Follow time intend two year asses short term long term efficacy . Records patient underwent Crawford tube insertion due allergic conjunctivitis anonymously collect Rabin Medical Centers ' database . The collect data analyze used comparison group study .</detailed_description>
