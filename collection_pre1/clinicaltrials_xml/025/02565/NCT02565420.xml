	<brief_summary>Perioperative volume saline cause mild acidosis compare buffered fluid . On hand , saline administration maintain plasma osmolality well replete vascular volume important goal perioperative fluid administration . Currently , convince evidence either saline buffer solution preferable . Consequently , type fluid remain common use Clinic worldwide . There never large trial perioperative saline balance salt solution compare incidence major complication include acute kidney injury . The investigator primary objective thus determine relative safety perioperative saline lactate Ringer 's solution . Specifically , investigator propose test : 1 . Primary hypothesis composite major in-hospital postoperative complication low patient give lactate Ringer 's solution compare normal saline . 2 . Secondary hypothesis acute kidney injury , measure AKIN criterion , low patient give lactate Ringer 's solution compare normal saline . The acquisition cost saline lactate Ringer 's solution similar United States . ( Curiously , buffer solution far expensive saline Great Britain . ) But extent one fluid provokes complication , cost care may increase fluid selection . Cost may also increase need additional electrolyte monitoring electrolyte replacement . The investigator therefore secondarily conduct economic evaluation determine relative incremental hospital cost fluid . To extent one fluid reduce cost ( assume similar complication rate ) , Clinic able reduce cost specify appropriate fluid without impair quality . Evidence one fluid cause complication would strong quality indicator Clinic standardize perioperative fluid selection .</brief_summary>
