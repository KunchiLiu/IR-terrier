	<detailed_description>Sickle cell disease genetic disorder cause point mutation amino acid sequence β chain hemoglobin . This common genetic disease world . The majority patient Sub-Saharan Africa ; however , increase migratory movement population help move patient initial zone disease . According recent data , 400 patient would follow Belgian hospital , 1 1500 newborn Belgium would major carrier hemoglobinopathy . The expressive frequent complication disease vaso-occlusive crisis , dominate painful syndrome . In addition vaso-occlusive crisis , many chronic biological disturbance observe sickle cell patient . Their contribution course disease become increasingly stress . Among intravascular hemolysis , hyper-adhesion blood cell vascular endothelium , inflammation , oxidative stress , vasculopathy bleeding disorder . Sickle cell disease consider nowadays hypercoagulable state . Indeed , sickle cell patient high risk non-hemorrhagic stroke , thrombosis pulmonary artery deep vein thrombosis otherwise associate mortality high morbidity . Many anomaly various level hemostatic system demonstrate coagulation activation even clinically stable condition . However , approach use far measure clot sickle cell disease segment sense various component hemostatic balance study separately . This scale complex , approach difficult give comprehensive integrate picture various disturbance system . The thrombin generation test functional test explore coagulation globally , integrate pro player anticoagulant actor system . The investigator use test demonstrate hemostatic potential high cohort affect child compare control child age . In cohort high hemostatic potential relate rate circulate microparticles intravascular hemolysis rate . Studies underway look correlation hemostatic potential clinical complication pediatric cohort . The use thrombin generation test study hemostasis adult patient sickle cell disease , contribution coagulation disorder occurrence complication disease remain little know . The investigator therefore : - Characterize hemostatic potential adult sickle cell patient follow CHU Brugmann - Search link hemostatic potential biological phenomenon observe disease ( intravascular hemolysis , microparticles , vasculopathy , inflammation ) - Search correlation clinical complication - Evaluate effect treatment ( include exchange transfusion ) hemostatic potential .</detailed_description>
