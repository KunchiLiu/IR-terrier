	<detailed_description>Objective : To assess efficacy increase IV fluid preload prevention post-epidural FHR change woman narrow pulse pressure Hypothesis : In individual narrow pulse pressure , increase IV fluid bolus reduce rate post-epidural FHR change . Background : In contemporary obstetric practice , regional anesthesia commonly utilized method pain management labor [ 1,2 ] . Compared anesthesia , neuraxial technique associate increase risk maternal hypotension , operative vaginal delivery , maternal fever , cesarean delivery fetal distress [ 3 ] . Following initial dose regional anesthesia , maternal hypotension FHR abnormalities occur report frequency 5-18 % 6-30 % respectively [ 4-9 ] . Neuraxial anesthesia induce sympathetic blockade , result decrease maternal systemic vascular resistance venous return . These alteration maternal hemodynamic profile impact maternal blood pressure , uteroplacental blood flow fetal perfusion , may contribute maternal hypotension change FHR initiation regional anesthesia . Importantly , hemodynamic change generally occur set constant maternal intravascular volume . Given uteroplacental circulation limit capacity autoregulation , uterine perfusion sensitive change maternal blood pressure venous return [ 10 ] . This physiology represent basis administration intravenous ( IV ) bolus prior placement regional anesthesia [ 11 ] . While maternal hypotension FHR change neuraxial anesthesia common occurrence , limited information maternal fetal characteristic risk factor publish [ 12-14 ] . A recent retrospective cohort study Miller et al . report narrow maternal pulse pressure risk factor post-epidural FHR change [ 14 ] . In cohort study , woman admission pulse pressure &lt; 45 , compare pulse pressure &gt; 45 , mark increase risk post-epidural FHR change ( 27 % vs 6 % , p &lt; 0.001 , OR 5.6 [ 2.1-14.3 ] , aOR 28.9 [ 3.8-221.4 ] ) . Interestingly , incidence maternal hypotension different two pulse pressure group ( 21 % vs 25 % , p=0.49 ) , suggest fetal perfusion sensitive reduce venous return associate increase venous capacitance relate reduce sympathetic tone . Further support premise , study Vricella et al . demonstrate increased rate post-epidural maternal hypotension , vasopressor support FHR change woman severe preeclampsia , clinical state volume contraction , compare normotensive control [ 15 ] . The author conclude vasoconstriction intravascular depletion central syndrome severe preeclampsia make subset woman vulnerable post-epidural hemodynamic change administration standard IV fluid bolus may adequately compensate increase venous capacitance . Data critical care trauma literature support use pulse pressure marker hypovolemia . Conventional static indicator cardiac preload , central venous pressure ( CVP ) pulmonary capillary wedge pressure ( PCWP ) , poor predictor `` volume responsiveness '' , cardiovascular response ( i.e . change preload ) intravascular volume expansion IV fluid . However , dynamic parameter variation pulse pressure stroke volume , highly predictive volume responsiveness [ 16 , 17 ] . While data pulse pressure variation primarily derive non-pregnant , mechanically ventilated individual , small case series demonstrate pulse pressure variation accurately reflect volume responsiveness pregnant woman undergo cesarean delivery regional anesthesia [ 18 ] . Additionally , data trauma literature also demonstrate pulse pressure represent accurate surrogate stroke volume marker central hypovolemia [ 19 , 20 ] . Covertino et al . report direct relationship pulse pressure central volume reduction without difference mean arterial pressure [ 19 ] . As , pulse pressure may serve good maker central hypovolemia blood pressure alone . Therefore , pulse pressure may better predict low maternal intravascular volume serve marker post-epidural FHR change . Pregnancy associate alteration blood pressure decrease vascular tone widen pulse pressure . Normal pulse pressure variation pregnancy poorly describe . However , otherwise healthy non-pregnant adult , stroke volume approximately 1.7 time pulse pressure [ 19 , 20 ] . Given stroke volume term pregnancy approximate 100 mL/min , normal pulse pressure pregnancy approximately 60 mmHg [ 21 ] . Therefore , level 45 mmHg propose define low pulse pressure pregnancy [ 14 ] . Notably , prospective study evaluate risk-factor base approach , namely use maternal volume status , guide volume IV fluid bolus administer prior neuraxial anesthesia . The investigator hypothesize individual narrow pulse pressure , increase IV fluid bolus reduce rate post-epidural FHR change . While pulse pressure variation best characterize marker fluid responsiveness previously healthy critically ill patient , parameter readily obtain use automate device ( FloTrac/Vigileo system , Edwards Lifesciences , Irvine , CA ) require arterial line . Furthermore , pulse pressure variation primarily assess mechanically ventilated patient , rare obstetric setting . Therefore , base preliminary data Miller et al. , investigator plan use pulse pressure ( pulse pressure variation ) marker intravascular volume study cut point 45 mmHg define low pulse pressure . Given previous study use IV fluid preload dos range 500-1500 mL , IV fluid dose regimen use study represent variation standard care [ 22 ] . A practical study design propose use current practice pattern low risk intervention low risk population . Study Design : Prospective Randomized Controlled Trial Study Protocol : Women meet eligibility criterion recruit randomized 1:1 ratio two study group : standard IV fluid bolus prior epidural placement ( 500 mL Lactated Ringers ) `` volume replacement '' IV fluid bolus 1500mL Lactated Ringers . IV fluid bolus infuse 30 minute administer within 1 hour epidural placement . A third group also recruit control , include woman pulse pressure &gt; 45 admission ( otherwise meet aforementioned inclusion/exclusion criterion ) . The control group receive standard preload bolus 500 mL prior epidural placement . This practical study use standard clinical practice method assess vital sign . Maternal vital sign ( blood pressure , heart rate ) collect left lateral recumbent position initial 5 minute period without activity . Automated device use assess blood pressure pulse pressure follow time : admission , immediately prior infusion IV fluid bolus preparation epidural placement , immediately follow IV fluid bolus infusion , epidural test dose ( T=0 ) , every 5 minute 30 minute ( T=0 T=30 ) , every 10 minute next 30 minute ( T=30 T=60 ) . The chart abstract identify change FHR intervention . Continuous external ( internal , place typical obstetric indication ) , fetal monitoring perform epidural placement standard L &amp; D unit . Treatment hypotension administration vasopressor additional IV fluid bolus along treatment FHR abnormality ( maternal position change , supplemental oxygen administration , tocolytic use , cessation oxytocin ) record . Operative delivery non-reassuring fetal status 60 minute epidural placement record . Additionally , maternal demographic medical/obstetric data , maternal neonatal delivery outcome data record . The technique epidural placement dose standardized follow . Epidural dose consist 5 mL 0.125 % bupivicane 10 mcg/mL fentanyl . This standard bolus dose administer level sensory block numeric patient pain score record . If patient achieve pain score 4 less 15 minute epidural bolus , additional bolus administer achieve appropriate pain control . The volume additional epidural bolus record .
