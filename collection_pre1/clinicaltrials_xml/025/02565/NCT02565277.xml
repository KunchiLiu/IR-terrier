	<brief_title>The Effect Influenza Vaccination Systemic Inflammatory Response Myocardial Protection Patients Undergoing Cardiac Surgery : Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator propose perform single center , double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled crossover trial analyze beneficial effect influenza vaccine patient undergoing cardiac surgery . This study assess impact influenza vaccination overall systemic inflammatory response investigate functional clinical outcome vaccinate patient cardiac surgery . The study sample consist patient undergoing cardiac surgery Health Sciences North randomize 2 group : 1 ) receive vaccine placebo preoperatively , : 2 ) receive vaccine placebo 4-6 week postoperatively . Subjects group compare use standard laboratory tool assess level various pro- anti-inflammatory cytokine ( IL-6 , IL-8 , TNF-alpha , IL-10 ) well cardiac inflammatory marker ( troponins , CRP ) , different time interval intra- post-operatively . Other clinical outcome also collect prospectively compare 2 group . These include hemodynamic parameter well major postoperative event . Further assessment include Frailty Index Scale ( patient 65+ ) length stay surgery</detailed_description>
