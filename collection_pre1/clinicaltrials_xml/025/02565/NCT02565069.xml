	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>1 . Age ≥ 18 year . 2 . Signed Patient Informed Consent Form ( ICF ) 3 . Scheduled undergo clinicallyindicated catheter ablation procedure treatment Persistent atrial fibrillation ( define continuous atrial fibrillation sustain beyond seven consecutive day ) . Drugresistant Atrial Fibrillation . ( fail 1 class I III antiarrhythmic drug ) demonstrate Persistent AF ( require drug electrical shock terminate ) Persistent AF despite prior conventional ablation . 4 . Previous procedure permit limited single Pulmonary Vein Isolation ( PVI ) . 5 . In AF time PreCartoFinder Map ( spontaneous induce ) 6 . Able willing comply pre , post , followup testing requirement . 1 . Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation 2 . Continuous AF &gt; 12 month ( 1Year ) ( Longstanding Persistent AF ) 3 . Cardioversion refractory ( The inability restore sinus rhythm 30 sec longer follow electrical cardioversion . If patient document evidence successfully cardioverted ( Normal Sinus Rhythm ( NSR ) &gt; 30 sec ) , patient must cardioverted prior ablation procedure . Failure cardiovert base criterion consider screen failure . 4 . A complex arrhythmia secondary reversible noncardiac cause . For example : complex arrhythmia secondary electrolyte imbalance thyroid disease . 5 . Left atrial size &gt; 55 mm ( echocardiography , parasternal long axis view ) . 6 . Significant congenital anomaly medical problem opinion investigator would preclude enrollment study . 7 . Structural atrial disease prior history atriotomy prior atrial surgery , presence atrial septal defect , and/or presence atrial septal closure patch . 8 . History current blood clot bleed abnormality , contraindication systemic anticoagulation ( i.e. , heparin , warfarin , dabigatran , direct thrombin inhibitor ) , significant pulmonary disease , cardiac surgery , unstable angina , uncontrolled heart failure , acute illness systemic infection , disease malfunction would preclude treatment opinion investigator . 9 . Enrollment experimental study evaluate another device drug investigation . 10 . Prosthetic valve 11 . Presence intramural thrombus , tumor abnormality / condition precludes vascular access , catheter introduction manipulation . 12 . Women child bear potential pregnant , lactate , plan become pregnant course trial . 13 . Presenting contraindication device use study , indicate respective Instructions For Use .</criteria>
