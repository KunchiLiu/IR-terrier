	<brief_summary>This trial consist 2 part : double-blinded phase open-label extension phase . The blinded phase describe record . Participants randomize 4:1 ratio receive GWP42003-P matching placebo . The hypothesis level clobazam ( CLB ) major metabolite ( N-CLB ) may alter ( increase decrease ) result use GWP42003-P .</brief_summary>
