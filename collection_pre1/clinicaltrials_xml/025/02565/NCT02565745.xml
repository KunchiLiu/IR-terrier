	<brief_title>Impact Use Dressings Versus Lubrication Skin With Cream Prevent Pressure Ulcers : Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . The intervention group A , receive application protective skin area great risk accord position patient care ( example Shoulders , trochanter , sacrum , malleolus , heel , elbow , occipital region ) . Skin protector shall prescribe doctor service , patient 's physician , physician group skin care usually do two institution far . Guard application do professional research group . 2 . Usual care group Group B , receive application moisturizer lubricant standardize institution area risk intervention group . The two group ( A B ) receive general care measure use anti bedsore mattress , change position every two hour , reduction friction shear . 3 . Follow It conducted nurse train aspect health hospitalization report medical record . Monitoring complete research staff time patient start ambulation , develop pressure ulcer , die discharge hospital . If patient get pressure ulcer forward Institutional wound care group . 4 . Results Primary outcome : incidence pressure ulcer grade I grade IV group ( difference risk pressure ulcer-Hazard Ratio ) . Secondary outcome : length hospital stay , time event pressure ulcer , event time begin ambulation hospital , cost difference group .</detailed_description>
