	<brief_title>Standardizing Language Laparoscopic Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Continuous communication primary surgeon assistant ( ) laparoscopic surgery essential . The primary surgeon rarely direct control laparoscope visual field . The use standard vernacular surgery provide clear instruction across surgical center currently employ . As theoretical benefit clear , national survey produce lexicon commands1 . Despite make intuitive sense , presently evidence demonstrate benefit use standardized language laparoscopic surgery . We aim show , significant improvement speed efficiency perform complex laparoscopic task . Objective To explore whether standardization communication primary surgeon assistant simulate laparoscopic environment decrease time need perform complex task . Materials Methods All subject provide demographic data , collect brief questionnaire . This questionnaire collect information regard level training year practice , well handedness . Personal identify information ( PII ) collect . Subjects block randomize control intervention group random number generation . Block randomization preserve equivalent distribution level training year practice group . Secondarily , handedness evenly distribute among group , supersede level training year practice . The intervention group receive presentation standardize laparoscopic lexicon ( SLL ) ( Mehdizadeh et al ) . The presentation focus section 1-3 ( surgical role , camera command instrument command ) . The control group receive pre-task presentation . Members within group assign laparoscopic trainer random allocation ( blind selection card denote station assignment ) . Through , trainer 2 subject group randomly assign . These subject refer `` primary surgeon '' `` assistant '' . Assignment initial role do randomly . A member pair assign role denote card he/she choose blindly . Pairs provide task place ball bag close open tensioning drawstring . This task must perform use laparoscopic graspers time invigilator . The ball approximately diameter bag open large enough require camera adjustment . This task commonly practice laparoscopic skill suture knot tie ( therefore less influenced level training ) require communication `` primary surgeon '' `` assistant '' accomplish timely fashion . The task complex require sufficient time detect difference group . Data collection within group include pair 's time completion task level training/years practice `` primary surgeon '' `` assistant '' . Invigilators track usage SLL task group . After break , role reverse task repeat . The data collect .</detailed_description>
