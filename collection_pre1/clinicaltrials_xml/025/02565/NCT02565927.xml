	<brief_title>A Trail Novel Tracheal Radioactive Stent Malignant Airway Obstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Malignant tumor lung , esophagus , thyroid , mediastinal structure often involve trachea direct tumor growth compression ( ) invasion . In addition , extrathoracic cancer metastasize lymph node well . However , surgical resection airway reconstruction gold-standard treatment MAO , many patient airway involvement poor surgical candidate base physiologic oncologic criteria.There three main type malignant airway obstruction : endobronchial obstruction , extrinsic compression , mixed pattern . For endobronchial obstruction , ablative technique destroy tissue indicate , include laser , electrocautery , argon plasma coagulation ( APC ) , photodynamic therapy , microdebriders , cryotherapy , primary tracheal cancer less common type lung cancer . If obstruction exclusively mainly due compression outside airway wall , option consist placement stent endoprosthesis . However , follow-up data demonstrate postoperative restenosis stenting occurs 5-45 % case result neoplastic infiltration mesh lumen tumor overgrowth mesh stent . Encouraged success 125I esophageal biliary stent esophageal carcinoma , tracheal stent load 125I radioactive seed develop investigators'institute . After successful vitro vivo evaluation delivery system , investigator prospectively compare response treatment irradiation tracheal stent versus conventional self-expandable stent patient MAO .</detailed_description>
