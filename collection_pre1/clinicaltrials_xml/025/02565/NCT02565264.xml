	<brief_summary>This study open prospective clinical trial . The objective evaluate effect autologous exosomes rich plasma cutaneous wound heal . The participant patient intractable cutaneous ulcer ( e.g . rheumatic disease , peripheral arterial disease , chronic venous insufficiency , decubitus burn ) . The participant treat autologous exosomes rich plasma every day 28 day . The cutaneous wound healing evaluate length , width depth wound .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Plasma Derived Exosomes Cutaneous Wound Healing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Exosomes small vesicle 0.03-0.1 μm size , shed cell type extracellular space via intracellular endocytosis . They find abundantly body fluid blood . They consist lipid bilayer structure stable . They preserve 2 week 4℃ . They contain protein , lipid nucleic acid include cod non-coding RNA . Resent study reveal exosomes important role cell-to-cell communication . The investigator find serum exosome level significantly decrease scleroderma patient vascular involvement cutaneous ulcer and/or pit scar compare normal subject . The investigator also elucidate serum-derived exosomes accelerate cutaneous wound heal BALB/c mouse . Exosome supplementation cutaneous ulcer seem significant therapeutic value . The objective present study evaluate effect exosomes derive plasma intractable cutaneous ulcer ( e.g . rheumatic disease , peripheral arterial disease , chronic venous insufficiency , decubitus burn ) . Autologous exosomes obtain participant ' plasma . The duration study 28days . The cutaneous wound healing evaluate day1 , day2 , day7 , day14 , day 21 day 28 .</detailed_description>
