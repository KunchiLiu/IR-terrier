	<brief_summary>Childhood schizophrenia `` early dissociative disorder '' rare disease low incidence approximately ( 1 0/00 30/00 ) . Its link autism spectrum disorder remain unknown although serious neurodevelopmental disease . As part 2011-2013 Interregional hospital Clinical Research program , University Department Child Adolescent Psychiatry Pediatric Hospitals CHU ( Centre Hospitalier Universitaire ) de Nice Lenval identify 15 patient complex phenotype characterize early schizophrenia associate autism spectrum disorder developmental disability mild moderate . This phenotype could new syndrome call `` schizotiste '' . The goal investigator 's project define genetic cause phenotype . The technique high throughput sequence use obtain sequence exomes patient family . This study therefore important give accurate diagnosis patient family . Moreover , investigator believe project identify new gene involve allow well understanding pathophysiology . Recent study show involvement mutation several gene ( eg Shank , NLGN , NRXN UPF3 ) different clinical phenotype . However , genetic basis child 's schizophrenia much less well know autism spectrum disorder .</brief_summary>
