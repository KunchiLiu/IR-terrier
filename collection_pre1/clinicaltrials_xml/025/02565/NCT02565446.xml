	<brief_summary>A variety liver insult lead pathological change liver architecture culminate cirrhosis . While invasive liver biopsy require detect cirrhosis , development magnetic resonance elastography ( MRE ) revolutionize ability detect liver fibrosis non-invasive mean involve measurement liver stiffness . However , number pathological finding occur liver response various insult precede cirrhosis clinically important identify steatosis associate NASH , inflammation associate viral hepatitis , congestion associate cardiac hepatopathy . Detection entities provide essential diagnostic , prognostic , treatment information yet available non-invasively . Recent murine study group investigator identify MRE technology adapt non-invasively detect condition . Implementing practice transform obviate need invasive liver biopsy patient suspect form suspect liver disease . This differentiate Mayo institution technology available . An additional aim study examine impact obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) pathogenesis nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) , common comorbidities obesity . Recent evidence indicate potential link OSA severity NASH fibrosis , mechanisms OSA- associate hypoxia liver disease progression NAFLD unclear . This study offer unique opportunity analyze association , study population undergo routine evaluation OSA , part preoperative work-up prior bariatric surgery .</brief_summary>
