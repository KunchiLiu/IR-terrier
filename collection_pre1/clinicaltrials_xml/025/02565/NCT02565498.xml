	<brief_summary>This study design determine preoperative image guide radiation therapy ( IGRT ) deliver use intensity modulate radiation therapy ( IMRT ) follow surgery result similar short-term wound heal complication surgery follow postoperative IGRT patient extremity truncal soft tissue sarcoma . Half patient receive preoperative radiotherapy , half receive postoperative radiotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Preoperative v Postoperative IMRT Extremity/Truncal STS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Perioperative RT addition surgery widely accept standard management soft tissue sarcoma ( STS ) extremity trunk . However , controversy remain whether RT deliver preoperatively postoperatively . While confer similar rate local control , preoperative RT lead decrease late tissue morbidity fibrosis , limb edema , joint stiffness fracture compare postoperative RT . The reason likely multifactorial , part relate total dose deliver ( 50 Gray ( GY ) preoperatively 60-66 Gy postoperatively ) , base previous National Cancer Institute ( Canada ) Phase III randomize control trial , much large volume treat postoperative setting compare preoperative setting . The optimal radiation dose use postoperative set unknown develop empirically dose 60-66 Gy generally employed.However , investigator Norway/Sweden France find equivalent local control rate patient negative surgical margin treat 50 GY postoperativelyThe main concern preoperative RT center risk increase rate delay wound heal major wound complication . Although study suggest may possible reduce incidence acute wound heal complication associate pre-operative radiation previously see 2D RT era , yet test phase III setting . IG-IMRT allows much high degree conformality accurate delivery dose tumour spar surround normal tissue . This may allow similar rate acute wound heal complication pre- postoperative RT treatment STS .</detailed_description>
