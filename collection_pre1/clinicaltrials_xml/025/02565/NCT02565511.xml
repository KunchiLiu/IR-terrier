	<brief_title>A Study CAD106 CNP520 Versus Placebo Participants Risk Onset Clinical Symptoms Alzheimer 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study assess effect two therapy give separately , target amyloid , cognition , global clinical status , underlie pathology participant risk onset clinical symptom Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . Cognitively unimpaired individual two APOE4 gene age 60 75 year , inclusive , select represent population particularly high risk progression Mild Cognitive Impairment and/or dementia due Alzheimer 's disease . The study follow randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , two-cohort , parallel group design participant receive one investigational treatment match placebo least 60 month maximum 96 month longer target number event TTE endpoint observe confirm either cohort . An unbalanced randomization ( active : placebo ) 5:3 ratio Cohort I ( 430 CAD106 :260 Placebo ) 3:2 ratio Cohort II ( 390 CNP520 : 260 Placebo ) apply . Randomization stratify age group ( 60-64 year , 65-75 year ) region ( North America/Other , Europe ) . Participants meet study entry requirement require undergo least two PET scan course study . Additional PET scan , blood CSF collection voluntary . The study ( also know API APOE4 trial ) conduct part Alzheimer 's Prevention Initiative ( API ) program .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male female , age 60 75 year inclusive . Females must consider postmenopausal child bear potential . MiniMental State Examination ( MMSE ) total score ≥ 24 cognitively unimpaired evaluated memory test perform screen . Homozygous APOE4 genotype . Participant 's willingness study partner . Any disability may prevent participant complete study requirement . Current medical neurological condition might impact cognition performance cognitive assessment . Advanced , severe progressive unstable disease may interfere safety , tolerability study assessment , put participant special risk . History malignancy organ system , treat untreated , within past 60 month . History hypersensitivity investigational drug excipients / adjuvant drug similar chemical class . Indication , current treatment ChEIs and/or another AD treatment ( e.g . memantine ) . Contraindication intolerance MRI PET investigation ( fluorinated radio ligand ) . Brain MRI result show finding unrelated AD , opinion Investigator might lead cause cognitive decline , might pose risk participant , might prevent satisfactory MRI assessment safety monitoring . Suicidal Ideation past six month , Suicidal Behavior past two year . A positive drug screen Screening , , Investigator 's opinion , due drug abuse . Significantly abnormal laboratory result Screening , result temporary condition . Current clinically significant ECG finding . For Cohort II : • Participants depigmenting hypopigmenting condition ( e.g . albinism vitiligo ) active / history chronic urticarial past year .</criteria>
