	<detailed_description>Pressure ulcer ( PUs ) localize skin underlying tissue injury result pressure pressure combine shear friction . In United States , annual treatment cost PUs estimate $ 11 billion cost manage single-full thickness PU almost $ 70,000 . According Beckrich Aronovitch , U.S. , almost 25 % approximately 1.6 million PUs develop acute care setting acquire intra-operatively surgery last three hour . The average estimate cost treatment PUs surgical patient $ 750 million - $ 1.5 billion per year . Surgical patient high risk develop pressure ulcer due presence many risk factor specific intra-operative environment . Intra-operative factor contribute development pressure ulcer include patient weight , age , type surgery , time operate table longer 2.5 hr , anesthetic agent , extra-corporeal circulation , use heat blanket presence vascular disease . The DabirAIR overlay system ( DOS ) semi-disposable , multi-patient use , alternate pressure ( AP ) overlay surgical medsurg bed application . The system develop new innovative tool surgeon perioperative professional alike help reduce risk deep tissue injury hospital-acquired pressure ulcer result long surgical procedure OR . Henry Ford Health System evaluate DabirAIR overlay system ( DOS ) effectiveness prevent hospital acquire pressure ulcer ( HAPU ) peri-operative setting . The evaluation do patient schedule neurosurgical procedure ( surgical procedure typically last long 3 hour ) . The primary objective study compare prevention-effectiveness ( incidence rate HAPU ) DOS ( treatment group ) v facility specific standard care pressure-relieving device ( ) ( control group ) peri-operatively discharge . About 400 patient treatment group neurosurgical procedure lie DOS operate room . Half patient treatment group also place DOS post-op ICUs recovery unit . Retrospective chart review perform 400 patient neurosurgical procedure lie facility specific standard care support surface operate room post-op ICUs . It hypothesize treatment group lower rate HAPU compare control group due pressure relief benefit offer DOS . Prevention HAPU result improve quality life clinical outcome cost saving healthcare facility .</detailed_description>
