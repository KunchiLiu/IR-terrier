	<brief_summary>NAPs previously show clear serum hepatitis B virus surface antigen ( HBsAg ) preclinically ( duck HBV infect duck ) human patient . REP 2139-Ca mediate HBsAg clearance act synergistically immunotherapeutic agent pegylated interferon-alpha 2a restore host immunological control HBV infection . REP 2165 version REP 2139 show preclinically retain antiviral activity low accumulation liver . Both REP 2139 REP 2165 use protocol formulate magnesium chelate complex , improve administration tolerability . This open label , randomize control study examine safety efficacy REP 2139-Mg REP 2165-Mg therapy patient HBeAg negative chronic hepatitis B use combination tenofovir disoproxil fumarate pegylated interferon alpha-2a .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>REP 2139-Mg REP 2165-Mg Combination Therapy Chronic Hepatitis B Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nucleic acid polymer ( NAPs ) utilize sequence independent property phosphorothioated oligonucleotides target apolipoprotein interaction involve formation HBV subviral particle ( SVPs ) comprise mainly hepatitis B surface antigen protein ( HBsAg ) . The effect NAPs block formation SVPs inside infect hepatocytes prevents secretion . As SVPs account &gt; 99.99 % HBsAg blood , NAPs effective approach clear HBsAg serum HBV infect patient . Previous clinical trial demonstrate treatment NAP REP 2139 ( REP 2139-Ca ) result rapid effective clearance ofHBsAg blood . This HBsAg removal immediate effect unmask underlying , pre-existing anti-HBsAg ( anti-HBs ) response , allow clearance HBV virus blood . Although REP 2139-Ca show safe human patient , share class effect phosphorothioate oligonucleotides accumulate liver repeat dosing . REP 2165 version REP 2139 design increase rate degradation slow liver accumulation keep antiviral activity intact . The antiviral efficacy REP 2165 show comparable REP 2139 pre-clinical model HBV infection significantly less accumulation liver . As , REP 2165 expect comparable antiviral efficacy human patient reduce liver accumulation treatment . HBsAg important immunosuppressive effect HBV infection show block adaptive innate immune process . Removal HBsAg blood patient remove immunosuppressive effect . Thus , important additional effect removal HBsAg blood greatly enhance effect pegylated interferon alpha 2a . It expect elimination serum HBsAg REP 2139-Mg REP 2165-Mg lead creation favourable immunological activation absence HBsAg , appearance free anti-HBs , clearance HBV virion blood synergistic immunostimulation conventional dosing pegylated interferon alpha-2a improve control HBV infection presence tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( TDF ) . All patient receive 24 week monotherapy TDF prior entry experimental active comparator arm .</detailed_description>
