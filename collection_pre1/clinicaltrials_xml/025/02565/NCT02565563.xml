	<brief_summary>The purpose study gain great insight Eye Movement Desensitisation Reprocessing ( EMDR ) . EMDR NHS recommend treatment , significantly reduce trauma symptom . There debate regard actually work , however evidence suggest eye movement component help reduce anxiety increase relaxation level . To measure arousal level EMDR previous research use electrocardiography ( ECG ) measure heart rate , offer insight effectiveness eye movement ( EM ) . All study date use ECG measure arousal level require technical knowledge administer interpret . Furthermore , apply electrode patient experience PTSD may heighten anxiety . The present study use new technology small device would gently attached end patient 's index finger . This device similar one measure oxygen level blood therefore simple piece equipment cause discomfort patient . The study also require patient 's face video record throughout face record . This match stag treatment ( i.e . EM start stop ) correspond arousal level outcome . The new technology digitally measure patient 's anxious relax arousal level EM EM treatment session . 10 NHS patient would recruit receive two treatment session ; one EM one without continue treatment usual without record device . EM EM phase occur least three time within treatment session therefore several measurement take analysed .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Recording Heart Rate Variability During Eye Movement Desensitisation Reprocessing With Without Eye Movement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>DESIGN Each patient receive Eye Movement Desensitisation Reprocessing ( EMDR ) treatment session eye movement ( EM ) EMDR treatment session without EM . Half complete EM session first half complete EM session first . After first session complete patient cross complete treatment session , approximately one week later . This know cross design allow patient act control group . Furthermore randomly allocate condition complete first reduce order effect . During treatment session patient arousal level digitally measure face video record . METHODOLOGY Patients refer trauma allocate NHS Tayside wait list . From January 2013 January 2014 approximately 72 patient across Tayside treat Post Traumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) and/or 'reaction severe stress , adjustment disorder ' . This take online patient database ( MiDIS ) , mandatory clinician NHS Tayside complete . PROCEDURE NHS Tayside Adult Psychological Therapies Service receive electronic referral , usually GP , state reason referral . The patient ' symptoms/diagnoses CHI number document diary waiting allocate next available appointment . The clinician look diary , noting one appear meet relevant diagnosis/symptoms ensure see EMDR qualify clinician choose see psychology . Patient 's appear meet initial criterion , send standard protocol appointment letter , state must contact service within 2 week still wish see psychology . Those choose see provide initial assessment session , information gather presenting problem history . They also ask complete routine questionnaire . This complete EMDR qualify clinician , time offer take part study believe patient suitable EMDR . If therapist believe patient suitable EMDR part standard protocol assessment complete patient allocate next available clinician treatment . If patient suitable clinician explain parameter study include , digitally measure arousal level video record patient 's face first two treatment session EMDR therapy assess clinician . Also first session clinician show equipment use provide participant information letter study take away think . Within information letter inform choose take part affect routine care even choose take part drop time continue treatment usual . The chief investigator 's contact detail also provide , require information . At end letter provide 2 option : 1 . I agree take part study . 2 . I wish take part study . They need contact service within 5 day first session inform u decision . This allow equipment set advance agree take part . Regardless whether decide take part study , next session within 2 week initial assessment , clinician take part , may different clinician take part , within standard service protocol . Those agree take part study require bring sign consent form ( contain within participant information letter ) second session complete another one day engage within study . Their second session either complete assessment process/other formal measure ( document ) start EMDR treatment . This clinician depend much information gather session 1 . This within standard service protocol . Before treatment begin patient must complete formal assessment measure . Only 2 treatment session use record equipment follow continue treatment without part study . If point decide longer wish take part , treatment continue usual , without record device . EMDR train clinician administer EMDR treatment 3 4 patient . As standard service protocol , patient receive minimum one hour per treatment session session take place NHS psychological therapy service building . Within treatment session patient expose EMDR eye movement ( Condition 1 , C1 ) EMDR without eye movement ( Condition 2 , C2 ) conduct EMDR accredit therapist . Patients randomly allocate either C1 C2 first session . Session one session two two week apart session last approximately one hour . At begin session patient require attach small infrared transmittance heart rate sensor ( HeartMath ) index finger , digitally record arousal level transfer responses laptop . Their face also video record entire session small camera laptop locate approximately three foot across . The purpose able match time specific EMDR phase administrate ( eye movement ) , time patient HRV response . Although face record throughout entire session , certain stage eight stage therapy protocol analyse . A five minute adaptation period give individual . During treatment session therapist use choose life event use within EMDR protocol . Where possible , clinician seek ensure patient complete full eight stage protocol outline Shapiro ( 1989 ) ( Appendix 1 ) . Each individual also score vividness scale condition complete . A self measure distress level ( know subjective unit distress [ SUD ] ) also obtain throughout session part standard EMDR protocol , require patient rate level distress scale 1 10 . MEASURES : Routinely use within National Health Service ( NHS ) : 1 . Beck 's Depression Inventory-II ( BDI-II ) ( Beck et al. , 1961 ) administer session 1 , ascertain participant ' mental health well . The BDI-II use widely use measure depression ( Beck et al , 1988 ) . 2 . The Life Events Checklist ( LEC ) ( Weathers et al. , 2013 ) administer session 1 2 , treatment commences , determine specific trauma patient subject within life . The LEC measure exposure potentially traumatic event , develop National Centre Posttraumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) . Once trauma identify specific trauma use within treatment . 3 . Impact event scale ( IES ) ( Horowitz et al. , 1979 ) complete session 1 2 , treatment begin . It administer conjunction LEC , measure post trauma symptomology , one widely use self-report measure . 4 . Patients self measure distress ( also know Subjective Units Distress [ SUDs ] ) - This measure scale 1 10 part eight stage EMDR protocol . This occur 2 treatment session . Measures routinely use NHS service : 1 . Dissociative Experiences Scale ( DES ) ( Bernstein &amp; Putnam ) : administer session 1 , screen patient dissociate , since EMDR find ineffective patient dissociate unable attend unpleasant thought . Patients score 30 exclude study . Although formal dissociate measure routinely use , therapist often use clinical judgement determine someone dissociate . 2 . Arousal level - Heart Rate Variability ( HRV ) digitally record use infrared transmittance heart rate sensor ( HeartMath ) connect patient 's index finger throughout entire 2 treatment session . The device similar device measure oxygen level blood . 3 . Facial Behaviour - A laptop camera , locate three foot away patient , record patient 's face throughout entire 2 treatment session , time different phase EMDR administer matched time patient 's arousal level response . In order accurately match patient ' arousal response treatment phase EMDR administer record must achieve . Recording facial behaviour may also allow observable analysis complete . 4 . Vividness Scale - Barrowcliff et al . ( 2004 ) find eye movement produce great reduction arousal vividness memory associate fear anxiety compare eye stationary condition use physiological measure arousal . It also find eye movement result reduced rating distress vividness compare eye movement condition ( Kavanagh et al , 2001 ) . Therefore study inform degree vividness associate particular image ask patient hold image mind ten second indicate ten centimetre visual analogue scale degree image appear vivid `` clear '' `` clear '' . The scale contain two anchor provide individual great clarity . This identical procedure use previous study vividness ( van den Hout et al. , 2001 ) . This administer 2 treatment session . DATA COLLECTION : Arousal level facial video recording collect laptop program . The chief investigator review analyse result order determine whether eye movement EMDR treatment significantly improve arousal level ( i.e . patient relaxed ) compare eye movement EMDR treatment . Analysis also include take time point across treatment session order determine whether arousal level improve course session ( i.e . patient anxiety level reduce course session ) . TIME FRAMES : Identify patient wait list 1st October 2015 . Patients get touch begin November commence treatment end November 2015 complete end February 2016 . Analyse data begin March 2016 commence write complete end April 2016 . A pilot study use technology similar method complete 4 Undergraduate student .</detailed_description>
