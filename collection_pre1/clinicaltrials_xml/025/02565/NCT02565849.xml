	<brief_summary>The Sickle Cell Anemia ( SCA ) recessive genetic condition , monogenic , result defect red cell structure . In investigator ' country , disease affect 3,000 child year consider one prevalent disorder among group exist hereditary disease . The lung frequently affect disease Acute Chest Syndrome ( STA ) . Besides lead cause death second lead cause hospitalization SCA , STA correlate cognitive impairment frame patient , result secondary Stroke vaso-occlusion capillary supply brain tissue . Traditional test pulmonary function allow ass whether person commitment respiratory system , whether obstructive , restrictive mixed . To run test necessary patient understands performs force expiratory maneuver obtain reliable result . In particular case SCA , perform test difficult due presence cognitive impairment vary degree . This result underdiagnosis early change lung parenchyma therapeutic window , commit proper monitoring treatment offer patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Ventilatory Mechanics Patients With Sickle Cell Anemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim present study observe use Forced Oscillation Technique ( FOT ) detection alteration respiratory mechanical subject Sickle Cell Anemia . One group patient Sickle Cell Anemia compare volunteer group without pulmonary alteration . The experimental phase research develop University Hospital Pulmonology Department Pedro Ernesto ( HUPE ) Laboratory Instrumentation Biomedical Rio de Janeiro State University ( UERJ ) approve Committee Ethics Hospital Survey . The Informed Consent obtain volunteer patient . The study protocol complies Helsinki Declaration Resolution CNS 466/12 . Patients recruit Hematology clinic University Hospital Pedro Ernesto . After screen inclusion criterion , individual refer follow test : Respiratory Function Support Technical Forced Oscillations . The Respiratory Function Test perform Pulmonary Function Testing Laboratory University Hospital Pedro Ernesto obey standard protocol American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society ( ATS / ERS ) . In clinical exam FOT , volunteer remain seated , head neutral position use nose clip . They ask maintain basal respiration throughout examination period silicone nozzle , cheek sustain hand order reduce shunt effect . The system apply sinusoidal pressure signal emit oscillatory wave frequency range 4-32 Hz . The result consider suitable , apre sit coherence function â‰¥ 0.9 . Three measurement perform 16 second , rest interval . Finally , analyze parameter measure , obtain average result . Among parameter evaluate resistive reactive parameter respiratory system study , respectively .</detailed_description>
