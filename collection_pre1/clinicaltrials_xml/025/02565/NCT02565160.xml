	<brief_summary>Making diagnosis underlie painful , swollen joint currently involve aspiration follow numerous microbiological biochemical laboratory test . This costly , time consume case acutely swell joint , lead lengthy inpatient admission . There unmet need provide quick , easy , reliable dipstick like test analyse joint fluid community , clinic , emergency department set . The investigator aim use well establish metabonomic technique : 1 . Analyse fluid patient swollen joint 2 . Identify potential biomarkers inflammatory , infective osteoarthritic cause joint swell 3 . Correlate lubrication wear property fluid The long term goal develop time save , cost effective , non-invasive diagnostic test improve management swollen joint . The biomedical research centre Imperial provide unique unparalleled clinical scientific environment conduct research . The Imperial College division Computational Systems Medicine international reputation metabonomics , together high volume patient swollen joint treat Imperial National Health Service Trust ( c1000/yr ) ensure study take place environment conductive success .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Swollen joint represent diagnostic challenge . Possible diagnosis include : osteoarthritis , gout , rheumatological disease infection . Diagnostic method limit microscopy , microbiology trace analysis . These method slow , time consuming , expensive often inconclusive . Osteoarthritis varies severity inflammatory response subsequent symptom . To date molecular link establish explain ambiguity . Previous study identify metabolite inflammatory response fail investigate correlation symptom response target injection . Microbial infection joint destructive . It typically take 2-3 day identify causative organism confirm diagnosis . Recent study suggest low-level bacterial colonisation within joint . The investigator aim analyse joint fluid bacterial colonisation use enrichment 16S Polymerase Chain Reaction ( PCR ) correlate result metabolic profile . In addition investigator aim seek metabolite indicative presence biofilm , present severely limit treatment option . Metabonomics quantitative measurement dynamic multiparametric response living system pathophysiological stimulus genetic modification . This provide global metabolic profile despite complex biological sample proven useful many field . Our hypothesis : 1 . Each pathology unique metabolic profile 2 . Inflammatory osteoarthritis contain different metabolic profile potentially biomarkers treatment and/or response 3 . Specifically presence detection organism sub-type biofilm biomarkers 4 . These profile characterise analysis blood , urine joint fluid 5 . This data use generate diagnostic test aid management swollen joint . 6 . There correlation metabolic profile lubricant property joint fluid , utilised future engineering strategy manage osteoarthritis . 1 . To analyse joint fluid osteoarthritic joint identify potential biomarkers disease understanding cartilage destruction pathways 2 . To assess population variance joint fluid composition use metabonomics whether composition correlate arthropathy joint 3 . To study lubrication wear property joint fluid understand metabolic profile influence lubrication subsequently joint wear . 4 . To study joint fluid use metabonomics identify biomarkers bacterial colonisation tandem microbial 16S Polymerase Chain Reaction genomic sequencing . Project Timeline : Phases project follow : Full research , Site Ethical Approval : Provisional ethic already grant . No obstacle research site approval expect achieve shortly afterwards . ( success = ethical approval ) Expected June 2015 Sample Collection : The investigator aim recruit 150 patient study capture conservative estimate 10 per week . All orthopaedic patient target . The majority expect recruit elective theatre . ( success = 150 pt recruit ) June - September 2015 ( onwards ) Metabonomic Analysis Method Development : Establishing Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ( NMR ) methodology metabolic profile synovial fluid sample matrix . Method development Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectroscopy ( LCMS ) untargeted targeted methodology synovial fluid ( success = achieve robust , sensitive methodology ) October 2015 Joint Fluid Tribology : Analysis lubricate property joint fluid ( success = 150 sample assay ) October - December 2015 Metabonomic Analysis : In order yield maximum result investigator aim analyse use NMR screen untargeted target LCMS analysis . With approximately 150 patient thus 450 body fluid sample investigator estimate analysis time 6 month ( success = metabolic profiling target analysis ) November - April 2016 Microbial Genetic Analysis : PCR sequence microbial genetic content joint fluid ( success = completion 150 sample ) April - June 2016 Collation result , Analysis Reporting : Preparation result submission journal impact factor &gt; 10 . ( success = editorial acceptance manuscript ) July - October 2016</detailed_description>
