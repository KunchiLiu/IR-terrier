	<detailed_description>Recent evidence suggest shift host-gut microbial relationship see small intestinal bacterial overgrowth ( SIBO ) may contribute pathogenesis IBS.Overgrowth microbiota small intestine cause excessive gas production malabsorption variety nonspecific symptom , diarrhea , gas bloating , abdominal pain constipation.Glucose ( GBT ) lactulose ( LBT ) breath test propose simple , inexpensive non-invasive diagnostic tool detect SIBO respect gold standard ( culture intestinal aspirate ) . Many antibiotic propose last year SIBO eradication.Rifaximin rifamycin derivative antibacterial activity cause inhibition bacterial synthesis RNA effective gram-positive -negative bacteria , include aerobe anaerobes.As &lt; 0.1 % oral dose absorb , rifaximin administration associate low side-effect incidence . However , still effective reliable treatment IBS , intend explore prevalence SIBO IBS-D patient evaluate efficacy rifaximin IBS-D Chinese population .</detailed_description>
