	<brief_summary>Background : DNA make instruction book people cell . Cancer disease cause DNA change build affect cell function . Researchers want learn may cause cancer test DNA people disease family member . Objective : To find DNA change may inherit may cause influence whether person get cancer . To study family cluster cancer find DNA mutation specific certain cancer . Eligibility : People 18 year age older : Participated familial genetic part NIH study 09-C-0079 , previous study family member enrol study Design : Participants may screen previous study . They give permission researcher use data tissue blood sample collect study . Participants may give blood sample . At stage testing , participant meet genetics health care provider . The provider explain test answer question . If researcher find DNA change might increase risk cancer health issue , confirm result test lab . This require blood sample . Participants personal DNA data health information put database research purpose .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - This study continue analysis begin 09C0079 focused identification genetic mutation associate new gastric polyposis syndrome , gastric adenocarcinoma proximal polyposis stomach ( GAPPS ) . - GAPPS autosomal dominant gastric polyposis syndrome confers substantial risk gastric adenocarcinoma . Objective - To specifically investigate family cluster cancer determine potential familial genetic mutation specific particular cancer present , compare genetic abnormality individual family without cancer . Eligibility : - Participants must previously enrol familial genetic analysis arm NIH study 09-C-0079 family member patient previously enrol familial genetic analysis arm 09-C-0079 . - Patients family member patient family history familial hereditary solid organ cancer clinical suspicion familial cancer ( patient may show evidence disease time enrollment ) . - Participants must 18 year age old study remain open participant genetic test component 09-C-0079 protocol . Design : - This protocol open continue use research approve protocol 09-C-0079 , analyze data publication , provide participant result clinical analytic validity clinical utility . - Only patient previously enrol 09-C-0079 family member patient previously enrol 09-C-0079 enrol study . All research objective study complete protocol 09-C-0079 .</detailed_description>
