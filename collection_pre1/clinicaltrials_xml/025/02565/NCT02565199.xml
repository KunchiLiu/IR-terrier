	<brief_title>Premotor Cortex : A New Target Stroke Motor Rehabilitation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Motor training important part recovery stroke . During motor training , stroke patient practice perform movement become well performing trained movement time . Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) , use magnetism excite neuron near surface brain , may improve performance . Healthy adult make large training-related improvement motor performance receive rTMS primary motor cortex motor training . There evidence premotor cortex may effective target primary motor cortex rTMS stroke survivor . In current study , investigator determine effect rTMS premotor cortex training-related improvement motor performance healthy adult .</detailed_description>
