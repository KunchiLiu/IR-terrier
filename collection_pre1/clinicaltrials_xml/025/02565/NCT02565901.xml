Biological therapy , sirolimus , use substance make live organism may stimulate suppress immune system different way stop tumor cell grow . Drugs use chemotherapy , docetaxel carboplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving sirolimus together docetaxel carboplatin may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To define recommended phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) sirolimus combine docetaxel carboplatin treatment metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) . ( Phase I ) II . To assess effectiveness sirolimus suppress induction deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) damage secretory component WNT16B tumor stroma follow docetaxel carboplatin . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess maximal prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) response sirolimus combine docetaxel carboplatin . ( Phase I ) II . To assess PSA response duration sirolimus combine docetaxel carboplatin . ( Phase I ) III . To assess response measurable disease . ( Phase I ) IV . To assess time progression bone lesion measurable disease ( Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors [ RECIST ] 1.1 ) . ( Phase I ) V. To assess effect sirolimus docetaxel carboplatin DNA damage surrogates cancer associate stroma compare untreated docetaxel carboplatin treat stroma . ( Phase I ) VI . To assess maximal PSA response sirolimus combine docetaxel carboplatin . ( Phase II ) VII . To assess PSA response duration sirolimus combine docetaxel carboplatin . ( Phase II ) VIII . To assess response measurable disease ( RECIST 1.1 ) . ( Phase II ) IX . To assess time progression bone lesion measurable disease ( RECIST 1.1 ) . ( Phase II ) X . To assess toxicity RP2D dose sirolimus docetaxel carboplatin . ( Phase II ) XI . To determine effect docetaxel carboplatin therapy DNA damage secretory program ( DDSP ) serum . ( Phase II ) XII . To determine response sirolimus , docetaxel carboplatin tumor mutation DNA repair pathway gene ( breast cancer gene 2 [ BRCA2 ] , ataxia telangiectasia mutate [ ATM ] Fanconi anemia complementation group [ FANC ] pathway member ) . ( Phase II ) XIII . To correlate presence DNA repair pathway mutation circulate tumor cell ( CTC ) circulate tumor DNA ( ctDNA ) tumor biopsy correlate change CTC number ctDNA mutation level clinical response . ( Phase II ) OUTLINE : This phase I , dose de-escalation study sirolimus follow phase II study . PHASE I : Patients receive sirolimus orally ( PO ) day -2* . Patients also receive docetaxel intravenously ( IV ) 30-60 minute carboplatin IV 30-60 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 10 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PHASE II : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive docetaxel IV 30-60 minute carboplatin IV 30 minute day 1 . Beginning course 2 continue subsequent course , patient also receive sirolimus PO day -2 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 10 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive sirolimus PO day -2 . Patients also receive docetaxel IV 30-60 minute carboplatin IV 30-60 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 10 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . * NOTE : Patients receive sirolimus 2 day prior chemotherapy day 1 ( day 0 ) .</detailed_description>
