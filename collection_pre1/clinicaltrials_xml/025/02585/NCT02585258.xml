	<brief_title>The Glucocorticoid Low-dose Outcome RheumatoId Arthritis Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) condition high impact individual society . In context comparing effectiveness exist healthcare intervention elderly , RA condition highly relevant community since strongly negative impact quality life individual , particularly frequent elderly , associate significant cost . RA management remain challenge : urgent unmet medical societal need improve treatment strategy effective , safe affordable . Evidence base information glucocorticoid ( GC ) harm/benefit balance high impact RA treatment strategy treatment strategy many inflammatory disorder GCs consider . The Glucocorticoid Low-dose Outcome RheumatoId Arthritis Study ( GLORIA ) 5-year project fund European Commission Horizon 2020 Program , design address need . Objective : The primary objective GLORIA project twofold : 1 . To assess effectiveness , safety cost-effectiveness low-dose GC therapy ( 5 mg/day ) compare placebo give two year co-treatment elderly RA patient ( ≥ 65 year ) pragmatic randomize trial ; 2 . To assess study medication adherence medication packaging solution , test effectiveness smart device technology improve adherence . Other objective GLORIA project : deliver outcome prediction model individual patient outcome , tailor treatment strategy elderly RA patient comorbidities ; deliver data support : 1. good guideline RA treatment elderly ; 2. accurate information elderly RA patient , physicians researcher ; 3. improved strategy trial design conduct elderly . Study design : The GLORIA study randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled pragmatic multicenter clinical trial ass effectiveness safety daily dose 5 mg prednisolone match placebo elderly RA patient . Patients randomize two arm : experimental arm ( receive prednisolone 5 mg/day ) control arm ( receive placebo ) . The design emulate routine care setting : eligibility criterion liberal , assessment procedure tailor represent standard care , concurrent antirheumatic treatment allow next trial medication minimal limitation . Furthermore , patient adherence monitoring device load cap drug bottle ; adherence data monitor throughout trial . In addition , test effect adherence reminder , substudy ( another trial ) nest main GLORIA trial . Substudy design : The substudy limit patient smart device ( smartphone , tablet , etc ) complete 3 month main study treatment . The experimental arm substudy receive application load onto smart device communicates adherence monitor device load cap drug bottle delivers reminder improve adherence . The control arm substudy application reminder . The substudy duration three month . Study population : Patients 65 year age old RA accord 2010 classification criterion American College Rheumatology ( ACR ) European League Against Rheumatism ( EULAR ) , require antirheumatic therapy inadequate disease control , evidence disease activity score 28 joint calculate erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( DAS28 ) ≥3.20 . Substudy population : Patients main study complete first 3 month treatment , possession familiar smart device . Intervention : In two-armed clinical trial , patient randomize either experimental arm control arm . The experimental arm receive prednisolone 5 mg/day add exist antirheumatic treatment . The control arm receive match placebo add exist antirheumatic treatment . Treatment duration two year per patient . Subsequently , study drug taper linear fashion zero 6 week insert increase number non-treatment day . Patients experience flare time restart open label prednisolone discretion treat rheumatologist . Co-interventions : As part standard care patient receive Calcium 500 mg/Vitamin D3 800 IU . Besides study medication , almost treatment allow ; treatment comorbidities , well antirheumatic treatment . This include biologic nonbiologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug ( DMARDs ) , non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) acetaminophen . However , advise start antirheumatic therapy ( DMARD , biologic ) give intra-articular intramuscular GC injection , especially first 3 month , allow clinically judge unavoidable . In case , preferred administration baseline . Substudy intervention : All patient adherence monitor device load cap drug bottle equip wireless transmitter , track adherence also communicate real time smart device patient ( smartphone , tablet , etc . ) , special software remind patient time medication . In substudy , patient smart device receive application load smart device communicates adherence monitor device load cap drug bottle . The app sends reminder message patient 's time take medication case non-adherence app also send alert message inform patient forgotten take medication . Eligible patient randomize either experimental arm receive reminder smart device , control arm receive reminder , period 3 month . Main study endpoint : - To measure benefit , primary endpoint ) sign symptom : time-averaged mean value ( estimate linear mixed model ) DAS28 ; b ) damage progression : change baseline 2-years total Sharp/van der Heijde damage score hand forefeet radiograph . - To measure safety , primary endpoint total number patient experience least one serious adverse event , one clinical event related disease therapy . - Other major outcome cost-effectiveness , cost-utility , medication adherence . Assessment take place vary interval , include seven clinic visit 3 assessment telephone . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : GLORIA pragmatic trial , measurement almost part standard care , therefore additional risk associate measurement . However , intervention trial patient randomize either standard care low-dose GCs standard care without low-dose GCs duration two year . It known GCs strong favorable effect disease activity , patient randomise control arm ( placebo ) benefit . However , side effect GCs know well , patient experimental arm ( prednisone 5 mg/day ) might suffer . Although side effect predominantly occur GC use high dos long period time , elderly likely suffer adverse effect disease therapy young patient . However , elderly underrepresented even exclude many clinical trial , difficult estimate risk : form rationale trial . To reduce risk , participant monitor patient low probability benefit patient high probability harm exclude participation trial . For substudy measure adherence innovative application , additional risk expect : application appear successful , patient randomise intervention benefit since improves medication adherence ; case application successful , patient randomise application patient without smart device , difference expect 'normal ' situation , patient access adherence application .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Population ( base ) RA patient 65 year age old require antirheumatic therapy . Inclusion criterion In order eligible participate study , subject must meet following criterion : RA accord 2010 classification criterion American College Rheumatology ( ACR ) European League Against Rheumatism ( EULAR ) ( Aletaha D 2010 ) ; inadequate disease control , evidence disease activity score 28 joint calculate erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( DAS28 ) ≥3.20 ; age ≥ 65 year .
