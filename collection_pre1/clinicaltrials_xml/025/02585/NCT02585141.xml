	<brief_title>Aspiration Treatment Perianal Abscess</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anorectal abscess common condition , cause cryptoglandular polymicrobial infection , traditional treatment surgical drainage . Anorectal abscess associate recurrence rate 6-44 % surgical drainage persistent subsequent fistula 37 % . Inadequate incision , miss abscess component fistulas cause recurrence . Surgical drainage associate discomfort prolong wound healing , affect daily activity well potential risk complicate scar fecal incontinence . Less invasive method pu aspiration antibiotic cover show safe term recurrence rate subsequent fistula formation well tolerate patient less morbidity wound complication potential low risk fecal incontinence . However , show study small population randomize control study compare two approach conduct publish knowledge . The risk factor recurrence subsequent fistula formation clear age 40 year , absence diabetes mellitus recent smoke show risk factor develop recurrent abscess fistula . Applying aspiration antibiotic method treatment perianal abscess advantage society due short recover period , quick return daily activity work avoid wound heal problem sphincter damage ; thus low expense . The result study potential reveal risk factor develop fistula perianal abscess .</detailed_description>
