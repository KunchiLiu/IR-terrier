	<brief_summary>The current study seek elucidate context pathological non-pathological eating behavior heterogeneous sample overweight obese child , age 8-14 year . Children undergo two-week ecological momentary assessment ( EMA ) protocol record eat episode physiological , emotional , interpersonal , environmental correlate .

	<brief_title>Ecological Momentary Assessment Eating Behavior Overweight Youth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Interested individual screen via phone initial study eligibility . Potentially eligible participant parent attend in-person screening University Chicago complete assent consent procedure . Youth height weight measure complete interview ass eat disorder symptom psychiatric comorbidities . Eligible participant parent complete self- parent-report assessment eat behavior , body image concern , psychiatric symptom , interpersonal functioning . Participants train complete EMA recording . A one-day practice period adherence ≥70 % rating qualify child initiate 14-day EMA study period ; data use statistical analysis reduce concern effect immediate reactivity self-monitoring . Youth self-monitor smartphone wireless device use ReTAINE ( Real-Time Assessment Natural Environment ) system . ReTAINE™ secure , web-based system allow momentary data collect wide variety portable device . Youth may use smartphone/wireless device one provide study team . Recent survey data suggest 80 % child adolescents access Internet cellular phone wireless device , indicate approach reasonable age group . EMA protocols complete good compliance youth . The propose study include three type EMA signal methods.63 First , participant signal 3-5 semi-random time throughout day ( signal-contingent ) report current affect , stressor , interpersonal functioning , report eat episode previously record . These signal occur random time 7:00-8:00am , 3:00-4:00pm , 6:00-7:00pm weekday , interfere school day ; 8:00-9:00am , 11:00am-12:00pm , 2:00-3:00pm , 5:00-6:00pm , 8:00-9:00pm weekend day . In addition , participant instruct complete momentary rating affect , stressor , interpersonal functioning , variety physiological , environmental , cognitive , behavioral factor associate eat soon eat episode possible ( event-contingent ) . Event-contingent rating allow assessment immediate consequence eat may miss random signal . Finally , participant complete rating affect , stressor , interpersonal functioning , physiological , environmental , cognitive , behavioral factor end day ( interval-contingent ) capture change since last random signal . This combination signal- , event- , interval- contingent recording successfully implement previous EMA study overweight youth . Participants contact phone first day EMA recording , point give feedback regard compliance rate , question concern regard assessment procedure discuss research assistant . Throughout 14-day assessment period , also attempt contact participant via telephone least twice per week check regard problem concern . This approach demonstrate success participant retention validate compliance previous research study require daily collection saliva sample interval rating mood disorder eating behavior 35 day . Complementary collection EMA data , Nutritional Data System Research ( NDS-R ) 65 use compile nutritional intake data eat episode report participant ReTAINE system . Two weekdays one weekend day 14-day protocol randomly select participant , participant contact phone ask recall detail day 's eat episode . The time point eat episode enter NDS-R system , nutritional data interest merge EMA data order assess contextual factor associate specific dietary pattern ( e.g. , consumption high fat meal ) . ActiGraph watch ( GT3X ) wear participant duration 14-day protocol compile data sleep pattern natural home environment . These computerized wristwatch-like device collect data generate movement minimally invasive . Participants ' parent also complete 14-day sleep diary record child 's bedtime wake time , provide start end time actigraphy analysis . At completion daily assessment phase , participant return University Chicago return loaner smartphone , applicable ; complete brief , final assessment ; receive final study incentive payment . The final assessment include modify version Child Eating Disorder Examination ( ChEDE ) interview cover previous two week EMA conduct . This assessment use determine change symptom frequency ( i.e. , reactivity study procedure ) .</detailed_description>
