	<brief_summary>Bronchiolitis one main reason consultation primary care emergency service , well lead cause hospitalization lower respiratory tract infection child two year . There still consensus medical management disease , clinical practice wide variability treatment inhale drug / oral bronchodilator , steroid , antihistamine despite viral etiology disease , result increase morbidity major economic benefit health service . Several study relation management bronchiolitis , one make 2014 Naval Hospital High Specialty include 90 participant compare 3 treatment . The treatment administer : dexamethasone epinephrine ( Levogira ) ( ED ) , hypertonic saline 3 % ( SSH 3 % ) saline 0.9 % ( SS 0.9 % ) , find handle ED SSH 3 % low rate hospital admission compare symptomatic management SS 0.9 % . Although superiority SSH3 % ED relation use SS 0.9 % demonstrate , possible establish difference statistically significant . Why consider necessary continue study focus determine difference effectiveness ED SSH 3 % . Therefore , purpose investigation determine whether difference use dexamethasone epinephrine versus hypertonic saline ( 3 % ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Respiratory tract infection one lead cause consultation Hospital General Naval de Alta Especialidad , emergency department outpatient . Only last year ( 2014 ) show total 2690 pediatric consultation provide emergency department , 1000 respiratory tract infection , constitute approximate percentage 37 % . This figure increase previous year ( 2013 ) emergency visit correspond 1130 290 case consultation box airway get percentage 25 % give . Due high incidence lower respiratory tract infection among patient pediatric ward , specifically infant two patient ; early diagnosis acute bronchiolitis essential initiate proper management without fall overuse drug show adequate result . In last five year see increase case bronchiolitis treat outpatient emergency department Naval General Hospital . Given data , priority reason consensus treatment patient bronchiolitis . Faced alarm epidemiological data nationally globally , difficult understand consensus management entity . Although mortality low , represent high cost society especially health institution , represent high rate income , empirical treatment logistical issue . This document intend obtain evidence well treatment population order establish optimal management without spill resource would reduce rate hospital admission , first Naval General Hospital High Specialty unify Naval Health center . All , solid foundation knowledge , late revision interest subject , order provide best care every patient . Among treatment give research application adrenaline include , usefulness base action cause alpha receptor cause vasoconstriction , decrease blood flow inflammation , responsible obstruction part pathophysiology bronchiolitis . During investigation decide use natural form ( Levogira ) less expensive investigator find accessible institution . Studies compare use relation racemic epinephrine , show difference . In addition report power 30 time high relation racemic epinephrine . The study feasible drug use study within basic framework hospital drug , involve cost use additional staff hospital .</detailed_description>
