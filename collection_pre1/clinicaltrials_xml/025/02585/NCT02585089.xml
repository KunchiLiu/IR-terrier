	<brief_summary>Spanish dry-cured ham show source antihypertensive peptide mice . To date , clinical study perform human check effect bioactive peptide produce naturally process pork dry-cured ham blood pressure . Therefore , aim present study investigate whether consume peptide cure pork ham demonstrate angiotensin I-converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitory activity lower blood pressure ( BP ) improve risk factor cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . Objectives : To demonstrate lowering effect bioactive peptide cure pork ham &gt; 10 month dry-curing process human . To check possible benefit relate dry-cured ham intake : platelet activation cardiovascular risk factor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Cured Pork Peptides Blood Pressure &amp; Cardiovascular Risk Factors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A two-arm cross-over clinical study diet control assess Catholic University Murcia ( UCAM ) . A recruitment 50 volunteer attempt order fulfil UCC calculation . The 50 patient divide two group ( 25 vs 25 ) . One group receive dry-cured pork ham &gt; 10 month proteolysis ( intervention product ) receive cook , uncured ham ( control product ) , one month . After two week wash , group exchange one additional month . In way , group take cook ham dry-cured pork ham 28 day arm . Pork ham Two pork ham raw meat use present study : dry-cured pork ham &gt; 10 month dry-curing process intervention product cook , uncured ham control product . Both product purchase vacuum bag label safety information ( expiration date , nutritional composition storage information ) . Dry-cured ham reduce salt use order decrease sodium intake could affect BP . Such ham contain 25 % low salt similar product market ( 3,7g vs 4,5g/100g ) ( see leaflet possible ham enclose ) . Dry-cured ham ( 80g ) take daily volunteer ( 50 % humidity ) ; BP measure follow . In order counteract high water contain ( 70 % humidity ) , high amount cook ham give control group ( 100g ) . Besides , cook ham contains 2.5g salt/100g relation 2,96g salt/80g reduce salt dry-cured ham . A restriction list food also give volunteer order control salt intake . Volunteers Caucasian men woman , age 35-60 year , good general health average systolic arterial pressure &gt; 130 mmHg diastolic &gt; 80 mmHg recruit . Exclusion criterion : smoker , Diabetes mellitus , diagnose treat hypertension , history cardiovascular event ( stroke , myocardial infarction peripheral vascular disease ) , medication : anti-hypertensives , vasodilator , lipid lower therapy fish oil supplement unless willing discontinue prior study ( supplement assess case case basis ) . Weight , height , body mass index waist circumference measure begin study qualify nurse . A list restrict food give begin study order avoid excessive salt consumption . Besides , three 24h intake survey conduct three consecutive day ( one Sunday ) study . Another survey regard diet habit salt intake also conduct three time , ham wash period . Blood pressure measurement Blood pressure measure two different approach : 24h ambulatory monitoring BP . 24h ambulatory monitoring . A 24h recording assess volunteer include study four different time point ( before/after control product before/after intervention product ) . Volunteers appoint blood extraction digital manometer device OMRON M24/7 BP5 properly calibrate installed volunteer . Home auto-monitoring BP . Auto-measurement BP perform follow recommendation Spanish Society Hypertension , Spanish League Against Hypertension ( SEHLELHA ) European Society Hypertension ( ESH ) three time intervention . On day first appointment doctor office , individual teach auto-measure BP home dominant arm determine . A digital manometer device OMROM 705CP properly calibrate give volunteer short period time . BP measure 3 time interventional product ( cured pork ham cook ham ) follow . The three different day , volunteer ask measure three time per day ( breakfast , 2h pork consumption —preferably lunch— dinner ) , measurement repeat three time , one minute apart . The volunteer measure BP seat rest 5 min position , smoke , ingest food caffeine beverage ( coffee , tea cola ) , exercise ( include stair climb ) previous 30 minute prior time measurement . Measurements do dominant arm . The systolic diastolic blood pressure reading record . The mean three measure use analysis . Biochemical parameter Blood take phase ( cure pork ham/cooked ham ) end intake , follow 2 week wash period ( total 4 time point ) . Blood analysis perform fast least 8 hour . Blood lipid profile ( total cholesterol , HDL , LDL triglycerides ) ; hemogram , plasma glucose , creatinine , albumin uric acid measure . Plasma collect stored -80ºC analysis C reactive protein , fibrinogen interleukin case . Participants ask provide 24-hour urine collection give write verbal instruction 24-hour collection . The first urine day discard urine follow 24 hour collect standard container provide . Total volume collection measure volunteer . Urine collection reject 24-hour urinary volume less 250 mL , time collection fell outside range 20-28 hour . In accordance standard procedure , urinary sodium potassium measure use ion select electrode method . Daily salt intake estimate base calculation 24-hour urinary sodium excretion assumption sodium ingest form sodium chloride .</detailed_description>
