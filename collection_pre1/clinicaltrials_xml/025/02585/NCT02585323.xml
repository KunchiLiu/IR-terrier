	<detailed_description>Current practice guideline emphasize use exercise weight reduction first-line management knee osteoarthritis ( OA ; affect 1 10 Canadians ) . However , 90 % people OA inactive . Several modifiable risk factor associate low physical activity participation , include lack motivation , doubt effectiveness prescribe exercise lack health professional advice regard way progress physical activity . The variety risk factor highlight need multifaceted approach provide support term knowledge , skill development timely advice health professional , well motivational support stay active . Our primary objective ass efficacy Fitbit/MaC intervention , involve use Fitbit Flex pair Monitoring Communication application ( MaC ) , brief education session , telephone counsel physiotherapist , improve physical activity participation reduce sedentary time people knee OA . Our secondary objective ass effect intervention patient ' OA disease status self-efficacy disease management . We carry three aim : 1 ) To develop Monitoring Communication application ( MaC app ) pair Fitbit enhance user experience ; 2 ) To conduct usability test navigation Fitbit/MaC app ; 3 ) To evaluate effect Fitbit/MaC intervention patient knee OA . In proof-of-concept randomized control trial ( RCT ) , investigator hypothesize compare control group ( i.e . Delayed Intervention Group ) , participant Immediate Intervention Group 1 ) increase moderate/vigorous physical activity ( MVPA ) determine objective measure , 2 ) reduce sedentary time waking hour , 3 ) improve OA disease status , 4 ) improve self-efficacy OA management . The investigator use mixed-method approach , involve RCT in-depth interview . The proof-of-concept study employ step wedge RCT design , whereby intervention sequentially roll participant number time period . The order individual receive intervention determine random . The strength design properly address efficacy question , avoid dilemma withhold intervention participant , parallel group design .</detailed_description>
