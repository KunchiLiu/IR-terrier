	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives : - To demonstrate superiority alirocumab comparison placebo reduction calculate low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) patient diabetes treated insulin hypercholesterolemia high cardiovascular risk adequately control maximally tolerate LDL-C lower therapy . - To evaluate safety tolerability alirocumab patient diabetes treated insulin . Secondary Objective : To demonstrate alirocumab superior comparison placebo effect lipid parameter ( ie , measure LDL-C , non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [ non-HDL-C ] , apolipoprotein B [ Apo B ] , total cholesterol [ TC ] , lipoprotein [ Lp ( ) ] ) , high density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C ) , triglyceride ( TG ) level , triglyceride rich lipoprotein ( TGRL ) , apolipoprotein A-1 ( Apo A-1 ) , apolipoprotein CIII ( Apo C-III ) , LDL particle number size ) .</brief_summary>
