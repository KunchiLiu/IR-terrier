	<brief_summary>The tracer 11C-methionine ( 11 C-MET ) use specific cell proliferation tracer show metabolically active tumordeposities . A healthy brain barely take 11C-MET , cause difference background tumor realively high . In addition , relatively little 11C-MET uptake inflammatory process . This make 11C-MET suitable positron emission tomography ( PET ) tracer order differentiate tumor progression therapy change . The latter major clinical problem investigation necessary . In order able make differentiation , direct post-operative baseline scan require . With regard advance MRI sequence , know necessary produce post-operative baseline scan within 48 hour . After timeframe , operation induce change start occur , granulation tissue . In case interpretation scan longer possible . Immediately postoperatively ( &lt; 48 hour ) 11C-MET never use . Therefore , unknown whether 11C-MET provide good baseline scan directly surgery . This pilot investigate feasibility 11C-MET baseline scan comparison result advance MRI sequence .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Viability 11C-MET-PET Post-surgery Baseline Scan High-grade Gliomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Conventional MRI , advance MRI 11C-MET-PET conduct day . The advanced MRI consist diffusion weight imaging ( DWI ) , perfusion image contrast technique ( DSC ) spectroscopy ( MRS ) . The post-operative MRI PET scan produce within 48 hour surgery ( aim operative effect visible baseline scan ) . This correspond current practice conventional MRI follow-up end radiotherapy . The comparison pre-operative scan ass viability post-operative scan . It assess whether preoperative tumor uptake disappear accordance resection , show advanced MRI sequence . In addition , assess whether interfere postoperative effect . The 11C-MET-PET scan interpret comparison quantitative result obtain advanced MRI sequence ( perfusion / diffusion / oxygenation / spectroscopy ) . If immediate postoperative 11C-MET-PET prof feasible , provide basis research . This future research consist differentiation tumor progression therapy change , one urgent clinical dilemma neuro-oncology .</detailed_description>
