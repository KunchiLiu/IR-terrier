	<brief_title>Dose-escalating AZD1775 + Concurrent Radiation + Cisplatin Intermediate/High Risk HNSCC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open label , single-arm , Phase 1b study design identify maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) use traditional 3+3 dose escalation design WEE-1 inhibitor AZD1775 add standard care chemotherapy ( cisplatin ) radiation treatment locally advance squamous cell cancer head neck ( HNSCC ) . The first cohort include start dose 50 mg AZD1775 give twice daily ( BID ) three consecutive day ( M-W ) concomitantly standard care cisplatin radiation . AZD1775 dose escalate 50 mg increment 200 mg BID ( M-W ) subsequent cohort determine MTD . Up 24 patient enrol , depend rate dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) . The investigator plan characterize toxicity ( safety ) profile regimen . Secondary objective include determination recommend phase 2 dose ( RP2D ; base safety data consideration ) , objective response rate ( ORR ) 12 week progression free survival ( PFS ) . investigator also estimate overall survival ( OS ) effective sample size allows . The investigator hypothesize investigator ' propose regimen safe , yield improve ORR PFS historical control . Correlative study perform archival tissue , optional fresh biopsy perform baseline mid-treatment . The investigator explore association p53 mutational status baseline well change checkpoint marker , ORR , PFS OS . Finally , investigator plan describe possible change QOL , speech swallowing .</detailed_description>
