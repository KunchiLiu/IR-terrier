	<brief_summary>The UK government 's Crown report title 'Review prescribing , supply &amp; administration medicine ' enabled optometrist train qualification independent prescribing ( IP ) . The UK introduce IP optometrist 2009 . The propose research focus role IP optometrist acute ophthalmic service Manchester Royal Eye Hospital ( MREH ) . The study compare IP optometrist consultant ophthalmologists ability diagnose , manage prescribe medication patient access service . To achieve comparison consent participant first clinical assessment IP Optometrist , finding include diagnosis management plan record onto research proforma . The consultant ophthalmologist mask IP Optometrist 's research proforma prevent bias . The consultant ophthalmologist perform clinical assessment second proforma inform participant diagnosis management plan . Percentage agreement , kappa ( κ ) weight κ calculate range parameter two proformas . Disagreement diagnosis management arbitrate separate ophthalmologist participate study specialty relevant participant 's condition . The main objective research expand limit base evidence IP optometrist ' ability diagnose , manage prescribe medication determine whether work least safely effectively consultant ophthalmologist acute ophthalmic service . It first study area since advent IP optometrists , one previous study publish IP introduce . The research enable type frequency condition present service measure .

	<brief_title>Independent Prescribing Optometrists Acute Ophthalmic Services</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>What purpose objective research ? The primary aim prospective , mask , control comparative study measure agreement diagnosis IP optometrists reference standard consultant ophthalmologist . A secondary aim measure agreement management diagnosis , include decision whether prescribe medication . The choice prescribe medication important prescribe decision count . This measure novel aspect research provide evidence IP optometrist ' ability safely prescribe . What scientific justification research ? The NHS 's emergency service experience increase demand ( Ismail et al 2013 ) , also true MREH 's Acute Referral Centre IP optometrists work part multidisciplinary team . There scientific need provide evidence base validate support role optometrist work acute ophthalmic service , well provide evidence IP optometrist 's ability safely prescribe medication . This evidence base may turn lend support nationally extend role IP Optometrists ' skill benefit Health Service . Establishing audit meet clinic need monitor performance IP optometrists work extend role . Guidelines IP optometrists work within MREH Acute Ophthalmic Services offer way optimise run clinic patient triaged clinician ophthalmologist fee see complex case . A novel aspect study compare optometrist ' management decision involve prescribe ocular medication since IP introduce ( General Optical Council 2014 ) . There evidence study safety prescribe decision IP optometrists acute ophthalmic care . Hau et al ( 2007 ) study entitle 'An evaluation optometrist ' ability correctly identify manage patient ocular disease accident emergency department eye hospital ' introduction IP . Duration The study begin Summer 2015 , pending ethic approval , last 18 month . Sample size A sample 1500 may achieve base 20 participant per week period 18 month . This break 2.5 participant per study session . It anticipate principal IP optometrist Acute Referral clinic work 4 session week potential perform ~690 clinical assessment study . The remain three IP optometrist work one session week potential perform ~172 clinical assessment . A sample size 500 disagreement diagnosis 15 individual require give target disagreement rate 3.0 % ( binomial 95 % CI 1.7-4.9 % ) . The large anticipated sample size ensure least 500 available prescribe decision make , whilst maintain small binomial confidence interval . Method The protocol study follow : 1 . Recruitment Patients invited take part study give study information either triaged walk-in , nurse-led Emergency Eye Centre ( EEC ) appointments-based Acute Referral Clinic ( ARC ) arrival ARC . An approved poster advertise study place wall ARC EEC . There small version reception desk ARC EEC accompany participant information leaflet . Willingness participate may depend individual presenting complaint . It may expect someone severe symptom triaged see urgently would less inclined two clinical assessment . Analysis present complaint may identify trend severity versus participation study . It make clear obligation participate people decide take part withdraw time . 2 . Informed consent There aspects way data use warrant consent participant , adequate assurance privacy confidentiality maintain . All participate optometrist ophthalmologist take informed consent . The clinician train Good Clinical Practice take informed consent . Consent may take place 4 hour wait clinic upon return follow appointment appropriate ( participant comparative clinical assessment ensure mask ) . 3 . Participant allocation cap Where time space , participant allocate clinical assessment IP optometrist wait clinical assessment ophthalmologist . Both clinical assessment need obtain measurement agreement . Sessions Consultant Ophthalmologist ARC allocate 'study session ' . The study session need allocate ensure approximately equal number patient see participate IP Optometrists . Consultant ophthalmologists various specialty work IP optometrist across 8 half day clinic week . A limitation collect data set time condition specific present even weekend sample representatively . Whilst restrict analysis certain condition ensure focus study , evaluation management IP Optometrists achieve . A pragmatic approach require recruitment patient study give organisational issue limit time room available see patient . The recruitment per session comparative arm study cap Ophthalmologist within clinic . Allowing cap ensures wait time keep within reason level care maintain . The cap risk introduce selection bias potential participant present clinic early may likely two comparative clinical assessment . The time attendance clinic record monitor happens . 4 . IP optometrist 's clinical assessment The follow protocol relevant participant undergo two comparative clinical assessment . The IP optometrist receive patient 's note , temporary presenting day , full note attend follow . There may nursing note include day include follow ; patient history record measure vision visual acuity ( include pin hole visual acuity reduce 0.20logMAR less ) , findings assessment slit-lamp front eye , measurement intraocular pressure , record pupil reaction time pupil dilation appropriate . The consultation document study proforma include follow : - history symptom include appropriate ; medical history , medication , previous ocular history , family history , occupation , drive status . - examination anterior segment eye slit-lamp direct ophthalmoscopy . - examination posterior segment appropriate direct ophthalmoscopy indirect biomicroscopy - tonometry ( previously record ) - diagnostic test need ( e.g . pachymetry , colour vision ) . The assessment expect lead formation work diagnosis management plan include follow appropriate ; prescribe ophthalmic medication , follow-up , referral discharge . The proforma box record diagnosis ( primary secondary appropriate ) , management plan , treatment ( include strength dose regimen ) , advice patient addition comment box permit judgment whether case could manage solely IP Optometrist . There may occasion condition present outside scope IP Optometrists experience , record comment box note reason . 5 . Masking storage IP optometrist 's proforma The first study proforma file one drawer cabinet lockable office . The proformas return patient note ophthalmologist assessment conclude anonymous photocopy take proformas research optometrist ( absence holiday different IP optometrist ensure mask ) . 6 . Ophthalmologist 's clinical assessment The ophthalmologist receive copy proforma along patient 's note , remain masked IP optometrist 's assessment . They follow protocol confirmation participant 's diagnosis management plan . 7 . Masking storage ophthalmologist proforma The ophthalmologist 's proforma securely store separate drawer lockable office . The proforma return patient note anonymous copy proforma photocopied end clinical session . 8 . Storage data Daniel Todd analyse anonymous copy proformas keep data store securely adhere legal requirement data protection . Proformas keep secure locked office electronic data encrypt stored secure NHS computer . 9 . Statistical analysis agreement The result IP Optometrists ' proformas compare agreement diagnosis ( primary outcome ) management include prescribe medication ( secondary ) consultant ' proforma . Percentage agreement , kappa ( κ ) weight κ calculate range parameter . A system adapt Marks et al ( 2012 ) comparative study ophthalmologist optometrist glaucoma management , originally base one Banes et al ( 2006 ) employ follow score give ; 1.00 = agreement , 0.75 = 1 step agreement , 0.50 = 2 step agreement , 0.25 = 3 step agreement 0.00 = 4 step . Agreement diagnose clinical management plan would support IP Optometrist 's role field provide evidence ability safely prescribe . 10 . Arbitration disagreement An arbitrator confirm disagreement ; may several diagnosis apply different way prescribe acceptable . Arbitration refers assessment agreement clinical care provide . Disagreement confirm show participant 's note proformas arbitrator , second ophthalmologist participate study specialty relevant participant 's complaint . The arbitrator would provide diagnosis management plan mask reached IP optometrist first ophthalmologist . Weekly meeting arbitrator arrange Daniel Todd . 11 . Dissemination result Once study 's data collect analysed discussion conclusion publish . Where participant expressly request feedback study , inform request ( telephone , e-mail letter ) .</detailed_description>
