	<detailed_description>Patients Methods This block-randomized , control , open-label trial evaluate relative caries preventive effect fluoridate table salt communal feeding preschool child 12 month . The study protocol approve Witten/Herdecke University institutional review board ( No . 106/2010 ) Department State Health Social Welfare Republic The Gambia form memorandum understand . All participant parent legal guardian give write informed consent aid native speaker study-related procedure perform study conduct line Declaration Helsinki . Figure 1 describes study design brief . Sample Size Sample size calculation perform G*Power 3 . Basic data sample size calculation mean dental caries experience preschool child urban part The Gambia report 2.09 dmft teeth ( SD : 1.92 ) . An effect measure caries prevention fluoridate table salt 35 % assume accord relevant literature . Alpha error set 0.05 , study power 80 % . A target sample 130 subject study arm ( test control group ) calculate . Study Population Eligible participant child age 3 - 5 year live urban Gambia preschool attendance co-operating kindergarten . The inclusion criterion participate study : 1. complete primary dentition 2. parental legal guardian inform consent . The exclusion criterion refusal participate study . Study End Points To measure caries preventive effect salt fluoridation ( 1 ) difference incidence cavitated carious lesion ( Δd3/4mft ) study relate intervention choose primary end point . Using primary study end point , relative preventive dental caries effect calculate accord follow formula : 100 - ( Δd3/4mft ( test group ) / Δd3/4mft ( control group ) ) x 100 . Secondary end point : ( 2 ) difference incidence white spot lesion ( ΔG2-4 ) G2 denote slight white spot formation , G3 denote excessive white spot formation , G4 denote white spot formation cavitation enamel . ( 3 ) difference incidence total carious lesion ( ΔTCL ( = G2-4 + d3/4mft ) ) . Total carious lesion ( TCL ) calculate weighted sum score accord follow weight : G2 : 1 point ; G3 : 2 point ; G4 : 3 point ; d3/4t ft : 4 point ; tooth pulpitis , ulcera , fistula abscess due caries : 5 point ; miss tooth ( mt ) : 6 point . For quality control , ( 4 ) fluoride concentration measurement table salt perform safety endpoint t0 , t0+6 mths , t0+12 mths = t1 . For purpose , package fluoridate salt provide study randomly select . Measurements execute use Orion Ionplus Fluoride Electrode ( Thermo Electron , Beverly , USA ) standardise calibration low-level measurement . The analysis undertaken triplicate per sample , mean calculate measurement point . The threshold limit value set 0.1 ppm F- . Participants Investigators Participants screen , recruit , include study two public preschool Brikama , West Coast Region , The Gambia , March 2012 . The screening dental examination take place regular teaching time affiliated dental station . Two investigation team perform study related examination . A team consist two dentist one clinical investigator serve information specialist . All equally calibrate clinical dental caries screen . Inter-examiner Cohen´s reliability Ҡ 0.82 [ Cohen , 1960 ] , indicate almost perfect match expert ( RAJ ) . Randomization Allocation Concealment As intervention procedure bound communal preschool feeding , individual randomization subject study arm feasible . Instead , one preschool choose intervention preschool serve control . The assortment intervention perform accord random selection person apart involve study ( LGW ) . All preschool child meet inclusion exclusion criterion primarily allocate test group control group , respectively . Interventions Natural fluoride availability Gambian West Coast Region determine advance interventional study evaluate general fluoride availability . In study region , fluoride concentration drinking water determine 0.1 mg/liter . In region , traditional oral hygiene child comprise ( fluoride ) toothpastes religious maturity age 12 year . Study relate intervention administration fluoridate table salt ( MarkenJodSalz + Fluorid , Südsalz , Heilbronn , Germany ) organise once-daily communal preschool feeding . Acccording manufacturer 's declaration , fluoride concentration fluoridate table salt 250 mg/kg . The central preschool kitchen instruct flavour meal calculate amount fluoridate table salt . The amount set 0.4 mg fluoride per capita day period 12 month . The study intervention period execute September 2012 August 2013 . The calculation total flavouring table salt amount follow : - number subject intervention preschool ( include subject include study take part communal preschool feed ) n = 450 - fluoride concentration fluoridate table salt : 25 mg F- per 100 g salt - recommended daily age-dependent supplementary dose : 0.4 mg fluoride per caput ( i. e. 0.05 - 0.07 mg F- per kg body weight ) - consequently , 720 g fluoridate table salt daily preparation communal preschool feeding , resp . 1.6 g fluoridate table salt per caput day , comply recent WHO recommendations salt intake . Meals control group prepare without fluoridate table salt . Before start intervention , subject receive dental examination t0 . Teeth clean electric toothbrush ( Vitality precision clean , Oral-B , Schwalbach , Germany ) inspection without use toothpaste . Teeth dry cotton roll ( Cotton roll kid , Roeko , Langenau , Germany ) hand-bellows ( Delamax , Berlin , Germany ) . Dental caries inspection perform visually aid dental mirror blunt probes natural light accord recent recommendation epidemiological field study . With respect available field hygiene measure , disposable dental instrument use ( Nordenta , Hamburg , Germany ) . After completion intervention , subject dentally examine t1 exact manner t0 . Study Settings According allocation concealment , subject test group preschool child `` Kindergarten Wattenscheid Gambia '' , Brikama-Kabafita , West Coast Region , The Gambia . Subjects control group preschool child `` Kindergarten Bottrop Gambia '' , Brikama , West Coast Region , The Gambia . Study Hypothesis The investigator use null hypothesis ( H0 ) assume statistical difference Δd3/4mft t1 test group control group . Statistical Analysis Demographic data compare inter group comparison use Wilcoxon rank sum test p &lt; 0.05 statistical significance . Analyses study end point perform use 95 percent confidence interval ( 95 % -CI ) . IBM SPSS software ( version 21 ; International Business Machines Corp , Armonk , USA ) use compute statistical analysis .</detailed_description>
