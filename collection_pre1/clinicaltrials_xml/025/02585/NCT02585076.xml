	<brief_summary>Arterial hypertension recognize major causal factor atrial fibrillation ( AF ) , common sustain cardiac arrhythmia . In light worldwide increase prevalence incidence accompany increase risk stroke , thromboembolic event mortality , AF emerge global healthcare problem . Early diagnosis AF , prior occurrence complication recognize priority prevention stroke . Once diagnose , anticoagulant therapy cornerstone management risk stroke AF patient . The 2012 ESC Guidelines recommend use risk factor-based approach stroke risk stratification AF patient . This study aim towards gain real-world data prevalence non-valvular atrial fibrillation ( NVAF ) among hypertensive Greece . The rate ESC guideline-adherent antithrombotic therapy basis stroke bleed risk assessment , factor influence treatment decision-making assess well patient diagnose arrhythmia . Finally , potential difference NVAF prevalence adequately inadequately controlled hypertensive document .</brief_summary>
