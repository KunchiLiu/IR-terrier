	<detailed_description>Canada country diverse geography , 19 % inhabitant community classify 'rural ' , many may still long distance travel reach health care facility . This result challenge uniform delivery health care throughout country . There 25,000 pacemaker ( PM ) implant 7000 implantable defibrillator ( ICD ) implant yearly Canada , approximately 120 000 patient live device . The recommended follow-up device base consensus position statement , majority patient require least yearly visit specialize device clinic lifetime device . During life patient , many issue may arise , atrial ventricular arrhythmia may result syncope , stroke sudden death , need increase monitoring result device advisory , minor programming adjustment improve device performance , simply need enhanced surveillance device battery deplete replacement anticipate . While remote monitor technology currently available permit surveillance device assessment patient location accessible landline mobile phone , use inconsistent Canada . In addition , new technology become available permit surveillance , also remote program device . The incorporation remote program capability , along automatic recalibration device setting , allow u develop new paradigm remote patient management patient receive device , would remain care local health team longer require travel specialize 'hub ' clinic follow-up .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients newly implant pacemaker/cardiac resynchronization therapy pacemaker ( CRTP ) capable remote patient management would eligible study follow site implantation occur OR patient newly implant defibrillator/CRTD capable remote patient management patient reside community OUTSIDE site implantation occur . The device may de novo patient undergo pulse generator change remote patient management capability . 2 . Able provide consent .</criteria>
