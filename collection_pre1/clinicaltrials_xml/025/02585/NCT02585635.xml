	<brief_summary>The MOrPH study design identify optimal prophylaxis schedule child haemophilia . This involve development combine pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic model . Interpretation model output inform two survey . The first survey family child haemophilia ascertain family ' value preference concern prophylaxis schedule . The second survey haemophilia physician ascertain criterion physician use prescribe prophylaxis schedule .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Risk Models Optimise Prophylaxis Schedules Children With Haemophilia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methods : Part I ( survey ) Two cross-sectional survey conduct , family survey clinician survey . The survey complete online . Participation voluntary anonymous . Family survey . The family survey identify preference family child haemophilia different prophylaxis schedule . At least 20 family participate . This number provide clear indication family 's preference different prophylaxis schedule . People eligible participate family survey haemophilia A B age 14 17 year , parent child ( &lt; 18 year ) haemophilia . Participants recruit use advertisement place community print-based and/or electronic communication , necessary , invite family attend youth camp people haemophilia . The survey ask participant characteristic child haemophilia include child 's age , current level frequency physical activity sport participation , current prophylactic medication schedule method administration . They also ask rate acceptability number possible prophylactic schedule `` acceptable '' , `` marginally acceptable '' `` unacceptable '' . Clinician survey . The second survey physician . To eligible , participant must physicians currently practise paediatric haemophilia treatment centre . Participants ask rank factor influence decision make advise patient regard prophylactic scheduling . These factor include : cost , tolerability family , venous access , physical activity sport , pharmacokinetics , inhibitor development age . They also ask report prophylactic schedule would considerable unacceptable , put aside issue regard efficacy . Methods : Part II ( model ) The MOrPH project use pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic modelling identify optimal prophylaxis schedule . Conventional pharmacokinetic model use identify prophylaxis schedule maximise time threshold minimise trough value clot factor concentrate . In addition , pharmacodynamic model develop provide child-specific prediction risk bleeds function prophylaxis schedule . The pharmacodynamic model use identify prophylaxis schedule minimise risk bleeds .</detailed_description>
