	<brief_summary>A number pharmacotherapies available smoke cessation New Zealand include nicotine replacement therapy , bupropion , antidepressant medication varenicline . Of , varenicline effective , also expensive . Varenicline act like nicotine stimulates nicotine receptor brain , less extent , simultaneously block nicotine binding receptor thus reduces reward effect cigarette smoking . Cytisine ( Tabex速 Desmoxan速 ) plant alkaloid also act similar way varenicline significantly cheap . It use 50 year part eastern central Europe aid quit smoking , approve use many country New Zealand , Australia , UK US . Randomised , placebo-controlled trial show cytisine effective placebo nicotine replacement therapy ( NRT ) smoke cessation . However paucity pre-clinical data cytisine . In particular , limited data pharmacokinetic dose response characteristic cytisine . Furthermore , current dose regimen recommend manufacturer complex clear basis empirical research . Complexity dose show key factor determine adherence . Therefore , simple regimen would likely maximise effectiveness treatment improve adherence treatment regimen . The investigator therefore propose undertake two study investigate influence dose , dose frequency dose duration pharmacokinetics tolerability cytisine cigarette crave smoker .</brief_summary>
