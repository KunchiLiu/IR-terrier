	<brief_summary>Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) fifth common cancer worldwide incidence 500 000 case per year . HCC commonly appear context liver chronic disease ( patient chronic viral hepatitis ( hepatitis B hepatitis C ) cirrhosis ) . Surgical resection liver transplantation concern patient early stage curative treatment . Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization , Radiation Therapy antiangiogenics treatment concern patient inoperable lesion ( palliative treatment ) . Antiangiogenic treatment enable inhibit angiogenesis process thus interrupt blood supply tumor . In clinical practice , efficacy anti-angiogenic agent usually assess method base morphological medical imaging . The measure target lesion obtain Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumor ( RECIST ) criterion WHO . However , morphological measure fully evaluate . An alternative functional medical image ass change diminution tumor size detectable . Since treatment induce generally necrosis without modification initial tumor size , new technology functional medical image particularly adapt early evaluation response treatment may improve patient management . In context , liver Perfusion MRI need assessed capacity early predict response antiangiogenic treatment . Positive result enable adapt therapy order improve overall survival patient avoid expensive treatment may turn inefficient generate important side-effects .</brief_summary>
