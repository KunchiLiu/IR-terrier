	<brief_summary>It recognize diet play critical role etiology management chronic disease diabetes , obesity cardiovascular disease . A high consumption fat , especially saturate fat , establish risk factor Cardiovascular Disease.The glycaemic index ( GI ) measurement ability different type carbohydrate-based food raise blood glucose . The interest low GI food weight management tool increase . Different type carbohydrate differ ability increase postprandial blood glucose insulin secretion , may also modulate effect different fatty acid . The current study compare consumption low high GI carbohydrate different fat saturation postprandial glucose , insulin , triacylglycerol response healthy participant . The data generate direct application public health policy clinical nutrition management chronic disease . The outcome study significantly contribute long term national goal Singapore manage reduce incidence chronic disease associate metabolic syndrome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Co-ingesting Low/High GI Meal With Different Fat Saturation Postprandial Glucose , Insulin , Triacylglycerol Responses Healthy Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study conduct use randomize , crossover design six dietary phase : low GI meal high GI meal saturate fat , monounsaturated fat polyunsaturated fat . All participant randomly allocate six test meal , order balance . Fifteen participant age 21 40 year recruit general public Singapore . During test session , maximum eleven blood sample collect fingerpricks cannulation . Fingerpricks cannulation may cause minor discomfort may slight bruise around site . Fingerpricks cannulation do experience research nurse train research officer minimize participant discomfort . If bruising occur , disappear within one day affect participant ' regular daily activity . Participants limited maximum two test per week . In addition , blood collection carry sterile designate area thus risk infection low . On rare occasion , participant may feel unwell test session . The investigator several metabolic suite bed individual rest . The research nurse research officer monitor individual ' condition provide ride home require . All study food prepare hygienic manner purpose-built research kitchen maintain high hygiene standard . The research staff undergone basic training food hygiene procedure . Hence , risk infective acute gastroenteritis minimal . A number dietary intervention aim investigate effect dietary fat quality glucose , insulin lipidemia response . Up study connect glycaemic load fat quality together . The investigator study 's result help public choose fat quality carbohydrate quality diet . Participants provide snack end test session . In addition , participant provide blood glucose , blood insulin , blood lipid profile , blood pressure , body composition result , brief interpretation conclusion study .</detailed_description>
