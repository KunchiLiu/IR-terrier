	<brief_summary>Dry eye syndrome ( DES ) highly prevalent ocular condition potential severe consequence affect patient . DES either cause decreased tear production increase tear evaporation , lead instable tear film . Despite many effort , generally accept methodology diagnose , assess severity monitor DES still lack . Moreover , widely use clinical method tear break time ( BUT ) , fluorescein stain cornea Schirmer test poorly reflect patients´ complains . One main problem diagnosis treatment DES critical component - tear film - difficult characterize . The development new ultra-high resolution optical coherence tomography system allow direct visualization human tear film non-invasive in-vivo measurement tear film thickness ( TFT ) . The investigator could recently show system provide excellent reproducibility able assess even subtle change TFT induce therapeutic intervention . However , extent tear film thickness associate standard clinical measure DES currently unknown . In present study , investigator set test hypothesis ocular TFT new good surrogate parameter assessment severity DES . Consequently , aim study present protocol investigate whether , extent clinical sign DES report symptom reflect ocular TFT . For purpose , cross sectional study healthy subject patient DES perform . This allow investigator specifically characterize role tear film DES ass whether measurement TFT OCT promise surrogate parameter diagnosis follow DES .</brief_summary>
