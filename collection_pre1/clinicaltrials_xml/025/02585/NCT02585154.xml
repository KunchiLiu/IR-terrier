	<brief_summary>Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) common , disabling , progressive condition characterise severe problem movement medical treatment long term unsatisfactory . Deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) treatment , directly stimulate nerve cell affect inside brain help overcome difficulty movement . Classically , DBS stimulate manner constant independent patient underlie condition reflect brainwave activity . Recent research suggest adjust DBS real time use analysis brain signal record DBS electrode ( term close loop DBS ) nay good classical DBS alleviate difficulty movement . However , remain unclear whether closed-loop DBS also lead few unwanted side effect movement control.In order answer question , investigator analyze DBS activity activity record surface head PD patient undergo DBS surgery . During recording patient perform different movement task . DBS find reduce patient ' ability suppress inappropriate movement certain task performance task core point interest . The recording conduct three time : During closed loop DBS , classical DBS stimulator turn . This allow investigator assess putative difference effect close loop classical DBS regard want unwanted effect movement control elucidate correlate brain .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Study participant PD patient undergo DBS subthalamic nucleus ( STN ) . Whether patient select DBS surgery determine patient 's clinical team purely independent clinical ground . Only patient accept DBS treatment clinical neurologist functional neurosurgeon introduce project detail pass research team information formal consenting . Able give inform consent . Lack capacity consent ( judged clinician take consent sufficient mental capacity understand study requirement ) . This include anyone , opinion clinician take consent , unlikely retain sufficient mental capacity duration involvement study . Cognitive impairment/lack capacity perform experimental task . We additionally conduct short ( 10 min ) quantitative assessment cognitive function use validated test ( MMSE ) . Patients score &lt; 20 exclude study .</criteria>
