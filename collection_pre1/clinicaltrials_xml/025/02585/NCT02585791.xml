	<brief_summary>This aim examine acute subacute exposures electronic cigarette ( EC ) vapor generate e-liquids without nicotine ( NFEC ) life-time non smoker subject measuring change nasal ion transport TGF-β level . Nasal ion transport assess nasal potential difference ( NPD ) . TGF-β level ( mRNA protein ELISA ) assess nasal cell lavage .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The recent introduction electronic cigarette ( ECs ) provide habitual smoker source nicotine without need inhale tobacco smoke thought reduce toxicity airway epithelial cell . The use ECs decrease use traditional cigarette diminishes nicotine withdrawal symptom lead opposite effect exhale NO level compare tobacco may diminish stimulation reward center brain lead less dependence due lack tobacco-derived chemical . The manufacturer ECs tout comparative safety reason switch traditional tobacco cigarette product . However dearth data support claim lead FDA issue warn letter company . For , World Health Organization recommend EC use ECs properly evaluate . On hand , American Association Public Health Physicians support use ECs mean `` Harms Reduction '' since ECs provide nicotine without myriad toxic chemical produce burn tobacco . These recommendation mostly due theoretical consideration expert opinion . Due novelty ECs , many concern safety health long-term nicotine addiction remain unanswered due lack study comprehensively evaluate toxicity airway . Moreover , ECs produce vapor mainly propylene glycol ( PG ) vegetable glycerin ( VG ) blend different concentration , make comprehensive test difficult . The lack consistent result demand full evaluation EC toxicity airway even nicotine inhale . In laboratory use culture primary NHBE cell ( either differentiate fully differentiate ) expose EC vapor equivalent volume filter air demonstrate EC vapor deliver fully differentiate NHBE cell high , realistic puff number decrease ciliary beat frequency ( CBF ) well BK channel ( pore form α subunit KCNMA1 ) FOXJ1 expression . We also preliminary data smoke exposure vitro vivo , show negative effect cigarette smoke nicotine parameter mucociliary clearance ( MCC ) nasal potential difference ( NPD ) , way assess ion transport vivo . These change occur TGF-β-dependent manner . This study design evaluate airway toxicity NFECs ( Aim 2.1 project `` Adverse effect inhale nicotine tobacco e-cigarettes '' ) . PRIMARY ENDPOINT As primary endpoint , assess consequence vaping EC liquid nicotine ( NFEC ) CFTR- CaCC-mediated chloride conductance lifetime non-smokers use nasal potential difference ( NPD ) measurement . We use NPD primary endpoint change clinical parameter see month even year exposure . For particular reason , recent surge find alternative biomarkers may use surrogate endpoint short clinical trial . Since NPD directly measure change ion transport expect influence MCC therefore overall outcome since change NPD measurement indirectly link lung function change MCC trial CF patient , believe NPD lend reasonable surrogate MCC study . SECONDARY ENDPOINTS Nasal nitric oxide TGF-ß level nasal lavage cell also collect correlate change NPD result exposure NFEC . STUDY DESIGN This aim examine whether acute subacute exposure NFEC vapor adverse effect lifetime non-smokers measure change nasal ion transport TGF-β level . Nasal ion transport assess nasal potential difference ( NPD ) , measure voltage potential result epithelial ion flux ( Na+ absorption Cl- K+ secretion mucosal surface vivo . In normal airway epithelium , Na+ absorption primary ion transport activity result airway surface potential difference negative reference interstitium . Ion transport across nasal epithelium representative finding distal airway . We also believe NPD reasonably sensitive biomarker study discuss . Therefore , evaluate acute effect NFEC vapor generate nicotine-carrier system ( `` e-liquid '' without nicotine ) subacute effect 7-days exposure NFEC . Since major difference ECs amount vapor produce per puff , focus commonly use mini mid-sized EC : Halo ( The Halo company , USA ) eGo-T® ( Joyetech Co. , Ltd. , ShenZhen China ) , examine different vapor fluid `` e-liquids '' ( 100 % PG , 50 % PG/50 % VG 100 % VG ) without nicotine .</detailed_description>
