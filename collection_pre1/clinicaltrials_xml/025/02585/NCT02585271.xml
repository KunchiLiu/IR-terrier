	<brief_title>Transanal Decompression Tube Versus Stent Acute Malignant Left-sided Colonic Rectal Obstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 8-47 % patient colorectal cancer present colonic obstruction . Left-sided colonic rectal cancer responsible nearly 70 % acute colonic obstruction . Emergency colonic surgery acute obstruction associate high mortality morbidity rate elective surgery . Preoperative decompression result less dilated bowel amenable elective surgery . Both transanal decompression tube stent serve good preoperative decompression effect serve good bridge surgery . Investigators aim compare clinical outcome transanal decompression tube bridge surgery stent bridge surgery acute malignant left-sided colonic rectal obstruction .</detailed_description>
