	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study side effect compare apixaban dalteparin reduce blood clot patient cancer-related venous thromboembolism . Venous thromboembolism condition blood clot form vein breaks move bloodstream . Patients cancer increase risk venous thromboembolism . Apixaban dalteparin drug use prevent blood clot form treat blood clot form . It yet know whether apixaban dalteparin effective reduce blood clot patient cancer relate venous thromboembolism .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Apixaban Dalteparin Reducing Blood Clots Patients With Cancer Related Venous Thromboembolism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Any episode major bleed include fatal bleeding . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I. Venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) recurrence include deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) , pulmonary embolism ( PE ) , fatal PE , arterial thromboembolism . II . Any episode major bleed include fatal bleeding episode clinically relevant non-major bleeding . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive apixaban orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-7 lower-dose apixaban PO BID day 8-180 . ARM II : Patients receive dalteparin subcutaneously ( SC ) daily ( QD ) day 1-30 lower-dose dalteparin SC QD day 31-180 . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 month .</detailed_description>
