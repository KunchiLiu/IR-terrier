	<detailed_description>Sugar-sweetened beverage ( SSBs ) epidemiologically link serious health problem include heart disease , liver disease , diabetes . This study recruit frequent SSB drinker employee University California , San Francisco ( UCSF ) measure marker metabolic health two occasion , 10 month apart . During time , UCSF cease sell SSBs campus medical center location . Additionally , first assessment half participant randomly assign brief intervention help reduce SSB consumption , consist 10-20 minute semi-structured interview design share health information SSBs , elicit motivation reduce consumption , help set concrete plan reduce consumption . We able compare change metabolic health among reduce SSB consumption . This make unique contribution grow evidence regard effect SSB consumption health modifiability SSB-related health condition . Two key clarification design study : 1 . The cessation sugar-sweetened beverage sale pre-existing workplace initiative . This study take advantage initiation part study intervention . 2 . The primary predictor study SSB consumption , condition assignment . Although report efficacy brief intervention , main goal study examine correlational relationship change SSB consumption change health , whether reduction associate intervention factor . Planned analysis : 1 . For outcomes sugar consumption SSB consumption ( see ) , primary analytic strategy correlate change SSB consumption change outcome . 2 . We additionally assess efficacy university initiative brief counsel intervention use linear mixed regression model estimate effect 1 ) time ( pre post ) , represent effect university SSB initiative , 2 ) assignment brief intervention interacting time . For types analysis , include demographic job-related covariates base fit criterion guide model selection .</detailed_description>
