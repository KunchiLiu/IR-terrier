	<brief_title>Deep Brain Frameless Radiosurgery Drug Resistant Invalidating Tremor . Dose Escalation Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND The stereotactic lesioning thalamus basal ganglion treatment tremor well-known procedure , introduction deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) , usually perform use stereotactic surgical procedure . [ 16 ] Consistent positive experience functional radiosurgery use Gamma Knife linear accelerator report since first report Leksell 1951 . [ 4 , 8 , 11 , 13 , 14 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 21 , 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 ] CyberKnife ( CK ) , ( Accuray Inc. , Sunnyvale , California , USA ) allow real frameless stereotactic radiosurgery recognizable intracranial target arteriovenous malformation ( AVMs ) , tumour , trigeminal nerve treatment trigeminal neuralgia . [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 7 , 9 , 23 ] When compare frame-based radiosurgery , frameless radiosurgery pain free procedure offer advantage well patient 's compliance avoid local anaesthesia discomfort due wear frame period time need whole procedure . The present literature functional frame-based radiosurgery ( mainly base Gamma Knife treatment ) show , mean dose 140 Gy effectively use , toxicity increase higher dos . Moreover minimal effective dose never report [ 8 , 10 , 15 , 25 ] . Based fact 3D dose distribution Gamma Knife show subtle substantial difference Cyberknife , choose low prescription dose compare literature data perform first attempt treat movement disorder . Particularly prescription dose minimum effective dose functional disorder trigeminal neuralgia identify . At time previous CyberKnife experience report . The first two patient treated Institution use lower treatment dos ( 75 90 Gy respectively ) [ 28 ] remarkably positive result thus bring u consider real relative effectiveness low dos . The minimum effective dose perform thalamotomy choose accordingly , draw dose escalation clinical trial rather de-escalation dose protocol . Particularly , protocol start dose 75 Gy reach dose 90 Gy . The analysis result trial highlight absence tremor control also confirm absolute safety select dos ( report toxicity ) . For aim present study continue experience define minimum effective dose perform safe frameless radiosurgical thalamotomy . Moreover radiosurgery invisible target treat movement disorder intractable pain far still domain frame-based procedure , due need solid reference system register anterior commissure-posterior commissure ( AC-PC ) line , allow use stereotactic atlas . In study want confirm precision previously define mathematical method ( use atlas-derived stereotactic coordinate ) perform safe frameless radiosurgery invisible target . STUDY DESIGN Longitudinal , interventional study . The project dose escalation study ( phase II study ) . The effect treatment term tremor control evaluate . Particularly , differences pre post-treatment tremor item score evaluate . The radiological ( MRI/CT ) appearance radiation necrosis treatment site well toxicity also consider . The study finish 4 dose level deliver . PRE-TREATMENT EVALUATION Prior medical history physical examination . Complete history , physical examination include detailed neurological examination evaluation Karnofsky Performance Status perform . The Fahn Tolosa Marin tremor rating scale ( FTMTRS ) assess patient . The unified Parkinson disease rating scale motor score utilize define severity symptom case Parkinson 's disease Unresponsiveness conservative treatment verify . Any prior surgery , prior radiation therapy and/or radiosurgery brain record . Prior surgery site lesion , prior radiation therapy and/or radiosurgery brain prevent patient participate protocol . Risk analysis surgery procedure express skilled neurological surgeon . PRE-TREATMENT IMAGING PROCEDURE A 1 mm thickness high quality CT Scan dedicate MRI always acquire . When possible 3tesla MRI utilized . The multimodality image fuse exported CK treatment planning system ( TPS ) . INFORMED CONSENT The write informed consent ( IRB approve ) signature mandatory prior examination related Cyberknife treatment . CYBERKNIFE RADIOSURGERY The target selection . The preferentially select target treatment VoO-VoP nuclei Thalamous The choice VoA ( 12-13 mm lateral midline , 2 mm anterior midcommissural point 2 mm superior commissural plane ) intend lessen risk anatomical variability patient . In fact , target relatively far motor fibre run posterior limb internal capsule far `` eloquent '' nucleus . The VIM nucleus consider similarity main feature . Target definition stereotactic atlas registration CT image . During CT scan critical patient 's head remain fixed position order avoid movement artefact . For patient high-quality image obtain restrain patient 's head use standard thermoplastic mask acquire image rapidly , always less 40 second CT equipment possession ( Light Speed Ultra , General Electric , Fairfield , Connecticut , USA ) . Mild sedation may necessary case head tremor . In severe case , body and/or head movement could prevent optimal image acquisition , administration low-dosage Midazolam anaesthesiological control mandatory . If head immobile CT gantry behaves like solid reference system fix relationship brain structure . In word CT screen may see bi-dimensional stereotactic frame pixel CT screen represent discrete part brain identify X lateral Y antero-posterior coordinate screen origin . The slice contain anterior commissure ( AC ) arbitrarily assign depth = 0 ( Z coordinate ) ; depth slice calculate relative point ( slice 1.25 mm thickness ) . In system calculate AC X , Y , Z coordinate ( Z = 0 ) coordinate posterior commissure ( PC ) Z distance mm slice zero . In case AC PC lie slice , AC PC Z coordinate equal zero calculation easier . Finally value pixel convert millimetre base matrix/FOV ratio CT screen . In word X Y value pixel brain image CT screen obtain Z derive depth slice measure vertical distance slice 0 . Finally calculate coordinate AC-PC midpoint , origin stereotactic atlas , simple rototranslation origin screen origin stereotactic atlas allow u obtain atlas-registered X , Y , Z coordinate millimeter point CT axial brain slice ( Fig . 1 ) . Target coordinate Voa/Vop complex ( X = +/-12 mm , Y = 2 mm , Z = 2 mm ) derive stereotactic atlas register midcommissural point easily transpose onto correspond CT slice target draw treatment planning system ( Multiplan , Accuray Inc. ) . In word , ax roto-translation CT screen commissural system patient allow use atlas-derived stereotactic coordinate make invisible functional target visible . The CT image also fuse MRI obtain anatomic detail anatomical structure surround estimate target . High quality control CT couch movement course mandatory described procedure possible undesired movement CT couch examination could affect precision Z coordinate ; even Voa/Vop complex relatively close ( slice + 2mm ) slice contain anterior commissure ( slice 0 ) , possible error must take account A MRI ( 1 mm slice , T1 sequence ) perform merge TC image . Radiosurgical planning After target volume identify critical normal structure contour , conjunction physicist , inverse planning use CyberKnife Treatment planning system ( TPS ) perform yield treatment plan . The treatment plan use treatment base analysis volume dose include dose-volume histogram ( DVH ) analyse PTV critical normal structure . Doses selection The aim procedure cause lesion confine estimate target . The first 2 patient treat dose 100 Gy 100 % isodose line , 3rd 4th patient escalate 120 Gy 100 % isodose line , 5th 6th patient treat 130 Gy 100 % isodose line dose escalate to140 Gy utilize ( 7th 8th ) . Treatment deliver single shot radiosurgery . PATIENT ASSESSMENTS Evaluation During Treatment Patients see evaluate CyberKnife radiosurgery documentation tolerance , include acute reaction . Evaluation Following Treatment Patients follow follow 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 24 month radiosurgery Images ( CT and/or MRI ) perform modification target size measure . The FTMTRS and/or UPDRS score assess . At follow-up visit , toxicity evaluate documented Criteria tremor response The tremor control assessment base quantitative/qualitative analysis pre post-treatment tremor rating scale score/graphical feature . The quantitative analysis base numerical difference pre post-treatment FTMTRS score . The qualitative analysis mainly base visual judgement Jancovich spiral draw FTMTRS.. UPDRS motor also evaluate patient affected Parkinson Disease ( PD ) . DISEASE RELATED DRUG ADMINISTRATION DURING THE TREATMENT AND FOLLOW-UP PERIOD Levodopa equivalent daily dosage ( LEDD ) tentatively maintain observation period . LEDD could modify relevant worsening symptom ( akinesia and/or rigidity tremor ) . STATISTICAL CONSIDERATION Descriptive statistic ( mean , percentage , frequency , etc . ) perform quantitative variable ADVERSE EVENTS AND RADIOSURGERY TOXICITY Adverse event grade register accord National Cancer Institute , Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( NCI-CTCAE ) version 4 . Serious Adverse Event stop criterion .
