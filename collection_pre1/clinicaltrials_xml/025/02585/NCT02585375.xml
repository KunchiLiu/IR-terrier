	<brief_summary>Topical antihypertensive eye drop key element modern antiglaucoma treatment . Most eye drop contain preservative allow use multi-dose container . In recent year evidence , however , accumulate preservative may induce ocular surface disease ( OSD ) . This particularly true widely use preservative , benzalkonium chloride ( BAK ) . Whereas well document many vitro animal study , evidence clinical trial sparse . The randomized masked study show superiority pivotal company-sponsored study indicate improve tolerability reduce hyperemia unpreserved versus preserve latanoprost eye drop . The investigator recently introduce optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) technology provide resolution high 1.2 µm human cornea . Using technology investigator able show tear film thickness ( TFT ) negatively correlate symptom OSD . Changes TFT assess high sensitivity level resolution also evident study administration lubricant . In present study , investigator hypothesize switch glaucoma patient preserve prostaglandin analogue unpreserved latanoprost associated increase TFT measure OCT. As control investigator use preserve latanoprost study hypothesis test randomize , control , single-masked parallel group design . TFT choose main outcome variable , standard measure sign symptom OSD select secondary outcome . The present study may provide valuable information superiority unpreserved versus preserve therapy .</brief_summary>
