	<brief_summary>Pressure ulcer ( PU ) skin breakdown often form blood flow skin reduce prolonged repeat exposure externally applied force . As many 85 % individual spinal cord injury ( SCI ) report occurrence least 1 PU since injure . Despite increase attention emphasis prevention , PUs still represent major health risk person SCI . Among numerous potential physical risk factor identify development PU several condition significant negative effect skin blood flow . In addition , improper management blood sugar major risk factor PU development impedes heal . It would appear hormone ( i.e. , chemical signal blood ) associate body use sugar target blood vessel may play important role development formation PU . In person SCI , skin blood flow response insulin ( i.e. , hormone help body use sugar also relax blood vessel allow blood flow increase ) low extremity show much low healthy individual . The propose study 30 individual chronic SCI difficult-to-heal pelvic region PU 2 phase : ( 1 ) 4-week `` observation '' phase [ PU heal appropriately ( determined digital photo software computation ) , subject find insulin resistant progress next phase study ] ( 2 ) 8-week `` treatment '' phase . All participant continue receive standard wound care throughout observation treatment phase . If surface area PU decrease 30 % 4-week observation phase , participant eligible enter 8-week treatment phase , randomly assign receive active drug ( e.g. , pioglitazone ) placebo . The participant four study visit follow acquire : digital image wound monitor wind surface area , skin blood flow measurement peri-wound area , blood test monitor liver function , kidney function , blood sugar ( hemoglobin A1C , insulin , glucose ) , nutritional status ( albumin pre-albumin ) , complete blood count differential , maker inflammation . Weekly monitoring symptom participant experience closely monitor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pressure ulcer ( PU ) skin breakdown often form blood flow skin reduce prolonged repeat exposure externally applied force . As many 85 % individual spinal cord injury ( SCI ) report occurrence least 1 PU since injure . Despite increase attention emphasis prevention strategy , PUs still represent major risk morbidity person SCI . Among numerous potential physical risk factor identify development PU several condition significant adverse influence skin blood flow . In addition , poor glycemic control major risk factor PU development impedes heal . Thus , would appear vasoactive hormone associate carbohydrate metabolism target endothelium may play important role development formation PU . In person SCI , skin blood flow response insulin low extremity show much low healthy individual despite clinical sign insulin resistance . In skin next PU , current proposal determine once-daily treatment pioglitazone 8 week improve skin blood flow insulin iontophoresis .</detailed_description>
