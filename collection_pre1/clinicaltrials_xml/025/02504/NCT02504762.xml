	<detailed_description>Globally , diabetes mellitus become major threat human health . An increase prevalence diabetes observe , part attribute age population , well increase rate obesity sedentary lifestyle Canada United States.1 Diabetes mellitus emerge epidemic estimate , currently , almost 18 million confirm case another 20 million patient impaired glucose tolerance risk diabetes , United States alone.2,3 Diabetes mellitus , either Type-I Type-II , strong risk factor development coronary artery disease ( CAD ) stroke . Eighty percent death among diabetic patient due atherosclerosis , compare 30 % among non-diabetic patients.2 A large NIH cohort study , First National Health Nutrition Examination Survey , reveal heart disease mortality general population decline much great rate diabetic patient . In fact , diabetic woman suffer increase heart disease mortality time period.4,5 Furthermore , despite recent reduction cardiovascular event amongst adult diabetes , absolute risk cardiovascular event remain 2- fold great amongst non-diabetic individuals.6 There various method treat multivessel CAD diabetic patient . Although conventional bypass ( cCABG ) beneficial percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) drug elute stent ( DES ) myocardial revascularization diabetic multivessel CAD , diabetic also patient experience complication , infection , high cost cCABG sternotomy . Recently , develop diffuse MICS CABG , combine PCI/DES vessel one front heart order constitute hybrid coronary revascularization ( HCR ) . The safety efficacy MICS CABG recently validate multicentre study research team , 100 % patency leave internal thoracic artery ( LITA ) -LAD axis angiography7 . Potential advantage HCR approach diabetic include avoidance sternotomy potential earlier recovery , less bleeding transfusion , few infection , decreased cost , increase patient acceptance , potentially maintain benefit cCABG due LITA-LAD axis diabetic population . Despite HCR 's theoretical advantage outline , novel innovative approach study randomized setting , context diabetic patient . Its rationale main research question stem MICS CABG work principal investigator , well recent , collaborative Lancet meta-analysis reveal diabetic patient multivessel coronary disease ( CAD ) well much survival bypass surgery stents8 . However , diabetic also patient experience complication infection cCABG incision breastbone . The investigator main hypothesis therefore HCR strategy diabetic multivessel CAD combine benefit bypass surgery artery front heart ( LAD ) , nearly eliminate risk complication wound infection , allow faster recovery improve quality life compare cCABG . Other blockage would treat PCI/DES reduce invasiveness procedure . Overall , investigator believe equipoise whether HCR well cCABG diabetic patient multivessel CAD constitutes next important question diabetes/CAD field . The investigator propose evaluate feasibility definitive trial examine question conduct present pilot trial . Upon study approval , time frame one year recruitment , follow 1 year follow-up . Since pilot trial , investigator assess feasibility conduct trial diabetic patient multivessel coronary artery disease . Should trial feasible , investigator extend study full-scale study . At time , application submit conduct study .</detailed_description>
