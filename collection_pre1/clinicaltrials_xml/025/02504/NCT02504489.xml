	<brief_summary>The primary purpose study compare overall survival NSCLC patient receive second- third-line chemotherapy docetaxel + plinabulin ( DP Arm ) patient treat docetaxel + placebo ( D Arm ) advance metastatic disease . Secondary purpose study : 1 . To compare neutropenia ( frequency , severity clinical sequela ) , duration response , quality life , response rate progression free survival patient NSCLC treat DP patient treat D second- third-line chemotherapy advance metastatic disease ; 2 . To compare safety adverse event profile DP D respectively , well dose delay , dose modification , and/or dose discontinuation docetaxel due safety concern two treatment arm . 3 .

	<detailed_description>Lung cancer lead cause cancer-related mortality worldwide . A report publish WHO February 2014 , estimate 1.83 million new case 1.59 million death worldwide 2012 . The American Lung Association report 399,431 Americans live lung cancer , estimate 221,200 new case predict diagnosed 2015 ; case 158,040 patient die lung cancer account approximately 29 % cancer death U.S . Similarly , lung cancer frequent cancer China among 1.96 million estimate annual cancer related death . Non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) account 85 % lung cancer China , approximately half patient present advanced disease time diagnosis . The prognosis patient advance metastatic NSCLC , either initial diagnosis recurrence , remain grim . The mainstay standard care chemotherapy agent include platinum analog , taxanes , vinca alkaloid , pemetrexed , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) inhibitor . For patient appropriate disease genotype , first line therapy also include , epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) inhibitor anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK ) inhibitor . In China US , first-line chemotherapy consist od regimen base one two platinum-based drug ( etoposide cisplatin etoposide carboplatin ) . The platinum analog commonly combine paclitaxel , docetaxel , gemcitabine vinorelbine drug irinotecan , etoposide vinblastine also use . For patient intolerant platinum-containing regimen , platinum-free double-agent chemotherapy regimen use alternative . For patient ECOG score 2 elderly patient , single-agent double-agent regimen recommend . The chemotherapy cisplatin plus vinorelbine may recombine human endostatin . China approve single-agent gefitinib may use first-line treatment locally advance metastatic NSCLC patient sensitive mutation epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase gene . Second-line Chemotherapy : In China US , drug use second-line treatment include docetaxel , pemetrexed target drug EGFR-TKI . Several drug [ docetaxel , pemetrexed , erlotinib , gefitinib ( outside U.S China ) , ramucirumab combine docetaxel ] approve single agent combination second line therapy locally advance metastatic NSCLC , limited efficacy , , limited clinical significant improvement overall survival . Docetaxel , taxane , bind stabilizes tubulin , thereby inhibit microtubule disassembly result cell cycle arrest G2/M phase cell death . In patient NSCLC previously treat platinum-based chemotherapy , second line therapy docetaxel afford median overall survival ( OS ) range 5.7 7.5 month . The common adverse reaction include infection , neutropenia , anemia , febrile neutropenia , hypersensitivity , thrombocytopenia , neuropathy , dysgeusia , dyspnea , constipation , anorexia , nail disorder , fluid retention , asthenia , pain , nausea , diarrhea , vomit , mucositis , alopecia , skin reaction , myalgia . Since approval docetaxel 1999 second line treatment advance metastatic NSCLC , drug , namely pemetrexed , erlotinib , approved indication . However , despite availability newer treatment , patient survival demonstrably improve docetaxel . The OS trial remain range 5.6-8.3 month . With advent molecular profiling , become possible select patient base disease genomic characteristic match disease genotype appropriate treatment . EGFR TKIs find particularly effective patient EGFR mutation , similarly crizotinib highly effective patient ALK translocation . However , NSCLC patient EGFR mutation ALK translocation minority . For 80-90 % patient U.S. without EGFR mutation , chemotherapy docetaxel standard care second line treatment . As recently report TAILOR trial , docetaxel demonstrate statistically significant survival improvement compare erlotinib . The median overall survival 8.2 month ( 95 % CI 5.8-10.9 ) docetaxel versus 5.4 month ( 4.5-6.8 ) erlotinib ( adjust hazard ratio [ HR ] 0.73 , 95 % CI 0.53-1.00 ; p=0.05 ) . As discussed , retrospective analysis plinabulin phase II study suggest plinabulin prolongs progression survival NSCLC patient large tumor . Tumor size well know prognostic factor survival NSCLC ; patient large tumor shorter survival patient small tumor . Among patient recurrent metastatic disease , especially wildtype EGFR ALK , presence large lesion carry particularly grim prognosis , treatment tumor represent unmet medical need . Large tumor carry rich tumor vasculature may make susceptible drug plinabulin . Plinabulin inhibit angiogenesis , disrupt exist tumor vasculature well induce cancer cell apoptosis . This study investigate efficacy safety plinabulin docetaxel combination patient wild type NSCLC large tumor require 2nd line therapy advance metastatic disease fail platinum-containing regimen . The primary endpoint overall survival ( OS ) docetaxel alone active comparator .</detailed_description>
