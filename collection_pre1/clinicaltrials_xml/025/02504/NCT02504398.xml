	<brief_title>Speed Injection Pain During Routine Infant Vaccinations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To date , evidence-based guidance regard rate vaccine inject minimize pain . This lead disparity practice . Some vaccinator favour slow rate injection ( around 8-10 sec/mL ) others prefer rapid rate injection ( around 2-4 sec/mL ) .The slow injection method lead long needle dwelling time increase possibility needle move around cause pain damaging muscle tissue . Rapid injection , hand , may lead sudden distension muscle tissue , could painful . Allowing muscle sufficient time distend order accommodate vaccine might minimize pain . This study address identify knowledge gap compare pain infant undergoing routine vaccination fast vs. slow injection speed .</detailed_description>
