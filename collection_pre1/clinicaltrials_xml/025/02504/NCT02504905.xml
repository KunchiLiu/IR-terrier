	<brief_summary>Background : - People dystonia muscle contraction control . These cause slow , repeat motion abnormal posture . People dystonia abnormality certain part brain . Researchers want study activity two different brain area people writer cramp cervical dystonia . Objective : - To compare brain activity people dystonia healthy people . Eligibility : - Right-handed people age 18 60 cervical dystonia writer cramp . - Healthy volunteer age . Design : - Participants screen physical exam . They answer question right- left-handed . - At study visit 1 , participant : &lt; TAB &gt; - Have neurological exam . - Answer question disease impact daily activity . - Have structural magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan . Participants lie table slide &lt; TAB &gt; metal cylinder . This surround strong magnetic field . - Do 2 simple computer task . - At study visit 2 : - Participants transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) 2 place head . Two wire &lt; TAB &gt; coil hold scalp . A brief electrical current creates magnetic pulse affect brain &lt; TAB &gt; activity . Muscles face , arm , leg might twitch . Participants may tense certain muscle simple task TMS . They may ask rate discomfort cause TMS . - Muscle activity right hand record electrode stuck skin hand .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Propensity Develop Plasticity Parieto- Cerebello-Motor Networks Dystonia From Perspective Abnormal High-Order Motor Processing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective The purpose protocol improve understand pathophysiology dystonia perform electrophysiological study use plasticity induction protocol base dual-site transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) . We hypothesize dystonic patient enhance responsiveness plasticity induction parieto-motor network . In another exploratory study , also explore responsiveness plasticity induction cerebello-motor network . The clinical significance enhance plasticity evaluate correlate plasticity measurement subject ' performance two task engage high-order motor processing involve parietal cortex cerebellum . Study Population There one main study one exploratory study similar design ; former explore parieto-motor network ( PAR study ) latter , cerebello-motor network ( CER study ) . There two independent arm study : one compare patient writer cramp ( WC ) age-matched healthy volunteer ( HV ) ; one compare patient cervical dystonia ( CD ) age-matched HVs . The power analysis main ( PAR ) study indicate need enroll 17 patient 17 healthy volunteer arm , additional 3 added account drop-outs . Therefore , request maximum 20 subject per patient group 40 subject control group . A second power analysis exploratory CER study indicate need enroll 13 healthy volunteer 13 patient arm , additional 3 added account drop-outs . Thus , request maximum 16 subject per patient group 32 subject control group . Design Subjects come one screen visit two outpatient study visit . During first study visit patient score clinically dystonia cerebellar sign . They also undergo structural magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) locate parietal target stimulation session . They perform two motor learn task : reach task visuomotor conflict predictive motor time task . At least 24 hour later , study visit two , subject receive TMS . TMS-induced electromyographic ( EMG ) activity hand muscle record motor evoke potential ( MEPs ) . Using single TMS shock , measure baseline , input-output ( I-O ) curve right first dorsal interosseous ( FDI ) muscle MEPs . Then , subject receive plasticity induction protocol aim induce plasticity pathway link posterior parietal ( PP ) cortex primary motor cortex ( M1 ) . To end , transcranial stimulation apply repeatedly ( 100 pair ) leave angular gyrus PP cortex leave M1 . At end intervention , I-O curve measure next 50 minute . The exploratory CER study experimental design . It differ PAR study type plasticity induction protocol use . Specifically , cerebellum stimulate rather PP cortex . Outcome Measures The amplitude MEPs I-O curve give information corticospinal excitability function TMS stimulation . The primary outcome measure MEP size respect time ( 15-20 min plasticity intervention ) . The difference MEP size compare HV patient group use T test . The performance behavioral task correlate primary outcome measure .</detailed_description>
