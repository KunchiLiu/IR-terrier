	<criteria>1 . Histologically and/or cytologically confirm pancreatic adenocarcinoma 2 . Stage IV disease ( metastatic ) 3 . No prior systemic therapy diagnosis ( except adjuvant set &gt; six month previously ) 4 . ECOG performance status 01 5 . At least 18 year age 6 . Evidence either follow RECISTdefined measurable disease ( lesion accurately measure least one dimension long diameter ≥ 20mm use conventional technique ≥10 mm spiral CT scan ) 7 . Female patient must either surgically sterile postmenopausal , childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test ( serum urine ) prior enrollment agree use effective barrier contraception period therapy . Oral , implantable , injectable contraceptive may affect cytochrome P450 interaction , therefore consider effective study . Male patient must surgically sterile must agree use effective contraception period therapy . The definition effective contraception base judgment investigator . 8 . Adequate bone marrow function : ANC ≥ 1500/uL platelet count ≥ 100,000/uL hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL 9 . Adequate hepatic function : Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X ULN 2mg/dL AST ( SGOT ) ≤ 2.5 X ULN ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 X ULN 10 . Adequate renal function determine either : Calculated measure creatinine clearance ≥ 40 mL/min ( calculated creatinine clearance , CockroftGault equation use ) . 11 . Ability understand nature study protocol give write informed consent . 12 . Willingness ability comply schedule visit , treatment plan , laboratory test , study procedure . 1 . History disease , metabolic dysfunction , physical examination finding , clinical laboratory find give reasonable suspicion disease condition , opinion investigator , render subject high risk treatment complication might affect interpretation result study . 2 . Presence central nervous system brain metastasis . 3 . Life expectancy &lt; 12 week 4 . Pregnancy ( positive pregnancy test ) lactation . 5 . Preexisting sensory neuropathy &gt; grade 1 . 6 . Clinically significant cardiac disease ( e.g . congestive heart failure , symptomatic coronary artery disease cardiac arrhythmia well controlled medication ) myocardial infarction within last 12 month . 7 . Major surgery within 4 week start study treatment , without complete recovery . 8 . Prior malignancy except adequately treat basal cell skin cancer , situ cervical cancer , adequately treated Stage I II cancer patient currently complete remission , form cancer patient diseasefree 5 year .</criteria>
