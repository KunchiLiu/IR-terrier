	<brief_summary>Background : - Research show drug everolimus stop cancer cell grow . It approve people advanced kidney cancer . Researchers want see also help people two type kidney cancer . Objective : - To see everolimus safe effective people Birt-Hogg-Dube Syndrome ( BHD ) -associated kidney cancer sporadic ( nonfamilial ) chromophobe renal cancer . Eligibility : - People age 18 BHD-associated kidney cancer advance sporadic chromophobe renal cancer . Design : - Participants screen : - Medical history , physical exam , blood urine test . - Computed tomography ( CT ) scan magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan . They lie machine take picture chest/abdomen/pelvis . - They may also screen : - Another scan , brain neck . - Bone scan . - Positron emission tomography scan fludeoxyglucose ( FDG-PET ) . - Heart lung test . - Tests hepatitis . - Participants take tablet day mouth year . They keep diary take tablet symptom . - During study , participant physical exam urine blood test . They scan chest/abdomen/pelvis . They may FDG-PET bone scan . - Participants test hepatitis may tumor sample take . - Participants follow-up visit 4 5 week finish take drug . They physical exam blood test . They may scan and/or hepatitis test . - Participants call every 3 6 month study end see</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Everolimus Therapy People With Birt-Hogg-Dube Syndrome ( BHD ) -Associated Kidney Cancer Sporadic Chromophobe Renal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Birt-Hogg-Dube ( BHD ) hereditary cancer syndrome clinical manifestation include cutaneous fibrofolliculomas , lung cysts/pneumothorax , renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) . RCC occur approximately 30 % patient BHD . It present early age onset commonly bilateral multifocal . - Tumors associate BHD variable histology , however approximately 85 % tumor chromophobe component ( either alone part hybrid tumor mixed element oncocytoma ) . - The current management include surgical resection partial nephrectomy tumor reach 3 cm . While significant morbidity associate repeat , partial nephrectomy approach , patient maintain renal function develop systemic disease . There proven systemic therapy option BHD date . - Chromophobe renal tumor occur sporadically account roughly 7 % newly diagnose kidney cancer . Histologically , tumor look identical chromophobe tumor associate BHD . Currently effective treatment advance chromophobe RCC recent case report suggest tumor may respond mTOR therapy . - Germline mutation gene Folliculin ( FLCN ) genetic hallmark BHD find great 90 % patient . FLCN believe function like classic tumor suppressor gene second hit wild type allele ( somatic mutation loss heterozygosity ) occur majority renal tumor . The genetic biochemical change accompany sporadic chromophobe tumor fully understood yet . However , appear histologically identical BHD-associated chromophobe tumor may share common underlying genetic biochemical feature . - BHD family harmatomaous disorder similar TSC Cowden Syndrome , study find activation PI3K/mTOR pathway BHD renal tumor . FLCN believe part complex interact AMPK involve regulation mTOR activity . In vitro vivo model FLCN loss demonstrate activation mTORC1 mTORC2 . - Preclinical data conditional FLCN knockout mouse demonstrate treatment sirolimus reverse renal manifestation . - We hypothesize mTOR inhibition everolimus treatment clinically active BHD associate RCC sporadically occur chromophobe renal tumor . Objectives : -To determine overall response rate everolimus treatment subject BHD-associated renal tumor 2 ) sporadic chromophobe renal tumor . Eligibility : -Patients renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) associate 1 ) Birt-Hogg-Dube Syndrome ( BHD ) 2 ) advance sporadic chromophobe kidney tumor . Design : - This open label , phase II study evaluate efficacy safety everolimus therapy patient BHD ( cohort 1 ) sporadic chromophobe renal tumor ( cohort 2 ) . Up 16 evaluable patient enrol cohort . - Tumor response rate measure RECIST BHD-associated sporadic chromophobe renal tumor ; efficacy analysis do independently two group . - Secondary endpoint evaluate growth rate ( cm/year ) therapy . - Additionally , reduction size lung cysts cutaneous fibrofolliculomas evaluate .</detailed_description>
