	<brief_summary>Background : - About 15 million Americans food allergy . Because cure effective prevention treatment food allergy , researcher want learn . Objective : - To learn cause effect food allergy related condition . Eligibility : - People age 2 99 food allergy and/or relate genetic condition - Their relative - Healthy relatives volunteer Design : - Participants least 3 visit 1 2 year , year 12 year . Each may last day longer . - Participants screen medical history , physical exam , questionnaire . - Participants may follow : - Blood test - Allergy skin prick test : Drops allergens place back arm . The skin scratch drop . - Leukapheresis : blood take needle one arm , pass machine , return needle arm . - X-rays - Esophageal string test : One end string tap cheek end pack capsule . When capsule swallow , string unwinds ; leave least 1 hour . - EGD colonoscopy : Biopsies take gastrointestinal system . - Tiny biopsy skin - Photographs body - Collection cell : - Swab nose , inside cheek , skin - Gentle skin scrape - Tape stripping : piece tape put skin pull .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There approximately 15 million Americans , include 6 million child , potentially life-threatening food allergy . The prevalence disease increase last three decade , United States develop country . There cure effective prevention treatment strategy food allergy . Moreover , little known factor account rise prevalence severity diseases recent year . Both genetic environmental factor likely contribute development food allergy , complex interaction variable frustrate effort elucidate pathogenesis develop mechanism-targeted therapy . Children food allergy 2 4 time likely diagnose asthma allergic condition child without food allergy , food allergy may also important trigger atopic dermatitis eosinophilic esophagitis . The Laboratory Allergic Diseases within National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases longstanding interest genetics pathogenesis allergic inflammatory disorder , National Institutes Health Clinical Center , provide ideal environment propose translational study . In study , : ( 1 ) investigate key genetic , cellular , immunologic , biochemical pathway lead development food allergy , ( 2 ) identify biomarkers predict clinical course natural history patient food allergy . Subjects eligible enrollment study include child adult food allergy patient known/suspected genetic congenital disorder potentially associate phenotype . Unaffected relative ( child adult ) enrol subject healthy volunteer ( child adult ) also eligible enrollment control . Most participant follow 2 year , although participant identify genetic congenital disorder subset participant food allergy may follow study end ( 12 year ) . Data obtain analysis blood , skin , saliva , stool , gastrointestinal biopsy , specimen use explore immunologic , biochemical , microbial , genetic basis food allergy . Results research study correlate scope severity clinical phenotype , response treatment , natural history allergic disease ( ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>GENERAL INCLUSION CRITERIA : All participant must meet following criterion : 1 . Be 2 99 yearsold time enrollment 2 . Willing allow storage blood , buccal swab , saliva , nasal swab , stool sample , clinically appropriate tissue specimens future use medical research 3 . Required primary care physician manage health condition relate unrelated study objective ADDITIONAL INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR AFFECTED PARTICIPANTS In addition general criterion list , affected participant must meet 1 follow criterion : 1 . Have clinical history immediate hypersensitivity reaction food ( ) sensitize food allergen ( ) ( evidence positive SPT allergenspecific IgE test ) 2 . Be sensitize ( evidence positive SPT allergenspecific IgE test ) food allergen ( ) overt clinical history IgEmediated symptoms eat food ( ) 3 . Have suspect genetic congenital disorder potentially associate food allergy related condition , determine principal investigator ( PI ) associate investigator ( AIs ) Additionally , participant meet criterion 1 3 must primary physician outside NIH must submit letter clinical summary document participant relevant health history . ADDITIONAL INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS In addition general criterion list , healthy volunteer must meet following criterion : 1 . Be unrelated affected participant 2 . Be unaffected food allergy ( determined clinical history and/or allergy test ) unaffected genetic condition study ADDITIONAL PROCEDURE SPECIFIC INCLUSION CRITERIA : The following additional inclusion criterion apply participant undergoing leukapheresis : 1 . Age great equal 12 year affect participant ; age great equal 18 year unaffected relative healthy volunteer 2 . Stable hematologic paramaters ( definition : white blood cell count &gt; 2,500/ L , hemoglobin &gt; 10 g/dL , platelet count &gt; 75,000/microliter ) GENERAL EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Participants exclude follow : Presence condition , judgment investigator refer physician , may put participant undue risk make unsuitable participation study . Inability participate duration study . The PI deem participation study would expect advance study goal . ADDITIONAL PROCEDURE SPECIFIC EXCLUSION CRITERIA Additional exclusion criterion apply participant undergo endoscopsy biopsy strictly research purpose . Participants exclude participate procedure meet follow criterion : 1. uncontrolled asthma Grade 3 high American Society Anesthesiologist s.Physical Status Classification System ( http : //www.asahq.org/resources/clinicalinformation/.asaphysicalstatusclassificationsystem ) 2. history adverse reaction conscious sedation general anesthesia require endoscopy 3. hemoglobin &lt; 12 g/dL 4. platelet count &lt; 100,000 microL 5 .
