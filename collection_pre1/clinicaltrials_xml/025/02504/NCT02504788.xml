	<brief_summary>Whole brain radiotherapy ( WBRT ) long practical effective therapeutic modality various setting management radiation oncology . For example , indication WBRT include brain metastasis metastasis , set prophylactic cranial irradiation ( PCI ) use mainly patient limited-stage small cell lung cancer , even patient extensive-stage small cell lung cancer . The rationale WBRT essentially base target microscopic gross intracranial disease . In addition provide rapid alleviation neurologic symptom enhance intracranial disease control , WBRT might also prolong time develop neurocognitive function ( NCF ) decline . However , paradoxically NCF decline also occur due sequel WBRT . In term time course WBRT-induced NCF decline , might vary considerably accord specific domain select measure . Early neurocognitive decline occurs within first 1 - 4 month WBRT brain metastasis . The domain early neurocognitive decline principally involve verbal short-term memory recall . Since several decade ago , understand hippocampus play essential role memory function . Not little evidence support radiation-induced damage hippocampus strongly associate NCF impairment . Furthermore , several study show isodose distribution hippocampus closely related neurocognitive function patient benign low-grade brain tumor . As consequence , hypothesize conformal hippocampal spar course WBRT ( HS-WBRT ) might provide significant preservation term cognitive function . This prospective cohort study aim explore evaluate impact delivery HS-WBRT pattern NCF change extent NCF decline patient receive prophylactic therapeutic WBRT . As compare previous relate relevant study , also investigate whether neurocognitive functional preservation achieve via integration hippocampal spar course WBRT .</brief_summary>
