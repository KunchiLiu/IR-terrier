	<detailed_description>This phase II , single-arm study assess safety efficacy AZD9291 ( 80 mg , orally , daily ) second-line ( later ) patient EGFR mutation-positive , locally advanced metastatic NSCLC , progress follow treatment approve epidermal growth factor tyrosine kinase inhibitor agent . If feasible , subject provide biopsy sample molecular test follow confirmed disease progression recent treatment regimen . A second biopsy sample progression AZD9291 , feasible . Liquid biopsies sample throughout treatment period . Subjects continue study treatment RECIST 1.1-defined progression treatment discontinuation criterion meet . There maximum duration treatment subject may continue receive investigational product beyond RECIST 1.1 define progression long continue show clinical benefit , judge investigator .</detailed_description>
