	<brief_title>Can Earlier BCG Vaccination Reduce Early Infant Mortality ? A Randomised Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : BCG oral polio vaccine ( OPV ) birth associate beneficial non-specific effect , reduce neonatal mortality explain prevention target disease . BCG recommend birth , often give much later , especially rural area . In two RCTs Guinea-Bissau , BCG-at-birth reduce neonatal mortality low birthweight ( &lt; 2500g ; LBW ) child 48 % ( 95 % CI : 18-67 % ) child birthweight &gt; 2500g ( NBW ) , OPV+BCG v BCG associate 32 % ( 95 % CI : 0-55 % ) low mortality . WHO recommend home visit shortly birth reduce mortality , vaccination normally provide . If vaccine indeed profound effect innate immunity neonatal mortality LBW NBW child many life could save BCG OPV provide earlier . We cluster randomise village home visit without vaccination . All child participate study offer routine vaccine village visit BHP team . Thereby study provide early vaccination child . Hypothesis : BCG+OPV birth provide village visit shortly birth reduce early infant mortality 40 % . Methods : The study conduct Biombo , Oio Cacheu Guinea-Bissau , home visit yet implement . At two-monthly visit BHP team register pregnant woman offer participate study . Community key informant communicate information birth village BHP study team , study nurse visit every new-born child shortly CKI call , possible day . Villages randomise receive immediate vaccination child shortly birth first visit BHP team . Statistical analysis : All child register pregnancy enter study visit home 24 hour birth whichever come last , thereby exclude death day birth . In main analysis , survival vaccinate child unvaccinated child compare Cox proportional hazard model age underlying time censor follow-up date first visit BHP team child control group also vaccinate . Similar mortality , incidence consultation hospital admission compare survival analysis age underlying time scale . All analysis investigate whether effect BCG differs sex . We investigate whether effect differs scar status mother . In addition stratify analysis age weight enrolment conduct . Guinea-Bissau two distinct season , dry season December May rainy season June November . We assess whether effect dry season ( December-May ) strong effect rest year . Nutritional status assess weight first home visit shortly birth first visit 6 week . We compare obtain weight different age WHO growth reference derive z-score weight-for-age [ 18 ] evaluate effect early BCG weight-for-age first 6 week life linear regression model . The effect BCG-at-birth BCG scar formation scar size assess logistic linear regression model . All analysis adjust clustering . Sample size : In rural area current study conduct , mortality day 1 day 42 2.9 % . A recent trial Ghana indicate three home visit first week life promote essential new-born care practice weigh assess child danger sign associate 8 % ( -12 25 % ) reduction neonatal mortality . Assuming single home visit reduces neonatal mortality maximum 10 % , effect BCG+OPV least 40 % reduction mortality need follow 4926 new-borns ( power 80 % ; significance level 5 % ; one-sided ; cluster design effect 1.1 ) . We expect 3 % censor due migration , therefore need enrol 5079 new-borns . In study village , annual number birth 2300 65 % vaccinated BHP nurse .</detailed_description>
