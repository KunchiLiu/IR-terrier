	<brief_summary>Current lab report design communicate result laboratory provider ; design accessible patient . The investigator believe new type genomic test report , tailor patient- well provider-use , enable patient access information understand allow involved management disorder , good navigate health care system , make informed decision health health care conjunction provider . This approach potential improve outcome patient provider perspective . The investigator propose study research question , `` Can genomic laboratory report tailor provider family patient improve interpretation complex result facilitate recommend care enhance communication share decision making ? ''</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The experimental design use phase project randomize , single-blinded pre- post-intervention trial crossover . Figure 2 depicts phase . As noted , subject study parent affect child enrol Whole Genome Sequencing ( WGS ) Clinical Research Pilot Study ( study within study ) . Parents appropriate subject study primary responsibility care management child ( ren ) affect chronic , rare condition would recipient communication test result either provider ( usual care ) propose enhanced report ( intervention ) . Both parent enrol WGS study purpose interpretation genomic result allow capture potential difference father mother . According WGS study protocol result WGS test provide geneticist genetic counselor informing session . At session , result return explained , recommendation provide question answer . Following session , parent consent participation propose study consent parent couple randomize either usual care intervention group randomization individual level would lead contamination spillover one member couple usual care arm intervention arm . The initial data collection choose survey instrument take place time . Care point forward provide patient 's refer provider although WGS study team available consultation need . The PI study staff inform session present therefore blind randomization . Because survey instrument , chosen base patient input Phase 1 ( process describe detail choice outcome ) , design specifically project , possible important difference usual care intervention arm could miss . To insure capture important difference second round qualitative interview take place final survey administer . Interviews do approximately 20 % subject arm , saturation achieve Qualitative A . In addition , since referral provider opportunity interact patient arm , important capture provider perspectives two approach order synthesize experience stakeholder group use improve enhance report . Given small number referral provider , attempt make interview individual maximize data acquisition . Qualitative method Phase I study .</detailed_description>
