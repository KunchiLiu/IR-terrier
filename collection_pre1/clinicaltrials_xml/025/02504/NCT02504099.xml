	<criteria>1 . Male female , least 18 year age time screen . 2 . Chronic HCV infection prior study enrollment screen laboratory result indicate HCV genotype 1 4 infection . 3 . Early stage HCC diagnose base typical hallmark HCC ( hypervascular arterial phase washout portal venous delay phase ) 4 . Compensated cirrhosis define ChildPugh score 5 6 Screening . â€¢ A minimal rim ascites detect image acceptable . Exclude ascites require need apply diuretic treatment control ascites 5 . Documented complete response HCC treatment . 6 . Females must postmenopausal 2 year surgically sterile practice acceptable form birth control 1 . Use know strong moderate inducer cytochrome P450 3A ( CYP3A ) subject receive OBV/PTV/r without DSV , strong inducer inhibitor ( e.g. , gemfibrozil ) cytochrome P450 2C8 ( CYP2C8 ) subject receive OBV/PTV/r DSV , medication contraindicate ritonavir RBV ( receive RBV ) within 2 week 10 halflives ( know ) , whichever longer , prior study drug . For medication contraindicate AbbVie 's 2DAA 3DAA regimen , refer recommend prescribe information section approve local product label . 2 . Positive test result hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) antihuman immunodeficiency virus antibody ( HIV Ab ) . 3 . Patients regardless eligibility liver transplant , comorbid disease might preclude completion study followup . 4 . Clinically significant abnormality , HCV infection , subject HCC base upon medical history , physical examination , vital sign , laboratory profile 12lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) make subject unsuitable candidate study opinion investigator .</criteria>
