	<brief_summary>The goal project improve lung cancer screen high-risk individual identify biomarkers preclinical disease disease risk measure minimally invasive non-invasive biospecimens . Existing biomarkers lung cancer diagnosis well new biomarkers discover specifically clinical setting examine . Biomarkers identify individual high risk diagnose lung cancer prior appearance concern symptom could increase utility lung cancer surveillance efficiency lung cancer chemoprevention clinical trial . Achieving goal would improve detection treatment early stage incipient lung cancer , restrict risk procedure individual currently exhibit early molecular warning sign impend disease .</brief_summary>
