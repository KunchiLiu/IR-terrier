	<brief_summary>Background : - Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) use decade help diagnose monitor neurological disorder like multiple sclerosis ( MS ) . Researchers want improve MRI picture take . They also want learn use new MRIs strong magnet get good picture standard MRIs provide . Objectives : - To collect data help researcher well understand MS related disease . Eligibility : - Adults 18 old MS MRI finding appear similar MS , neurological disease may look act like MS. - Healthy adult volunteer . Design : - Participants screen review medical record . - Participants baseline visit . It include physical exam , medical history , neurological exam . They may blood test . - The study last indefinitely . - Participants may MRIs . Some MRIs may include contrast dye . For , needle use guide thin plastic tube arm vein . - Participants may 2 lumbar puncture per year . Skin numb needle insert back bone remove fluid . - Participants may give saliva sample eye exam . - Participants may evoke potential test . These measure nervous system respond different type stimulation . Participants may sit front TV watch picture screen . Or may wear earphone make click noise static . Or may get small electrical shock may tingle cause hand foot twitch . - Participants may test strength , spasticity , sensation , balance , and/or walking .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives . The goal protocol study pathophysiology multiple sclerosis ( MS ) , primarily small study utilize magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , correlate result clinical biological measure . The protocol include technique minimal risk ( standard quantitative clinical evaluation , MRI , blood draw , saliva testing , lumbar puncture , visual evoke potential , ophthalmologic evaluation ) more-than-minimal risk ( injection approve gadolinium-based contrast agent ) appropriate common study population . Under protocol , conduct : - Pilot substudies . These study exploratory hypothesis generating . Once sufficient data collect justify hypothesis-driven study formal power analysis , work continue either dedicate protocol , appropriate , hypothesis-testing substudy . There enrollment limitation pilot substudies . - Hypothesis-testing substudy . These study specific hypothesis test 6 participant per arm . If additional participant require , Principal Investigator ( PI ) Protocol Review Committee ( PIRC ) decide together whether continue hypothesis-testing substudy participant without amendment , file amendment new protocol . A memo request review hypothesis-testing substudy possible additional enrollment send PIRC statistical reviewer . The memo also forward IRB . - Individual patient substudies . These study seek increase knowledge disease process assist diagnosis individual patient . - Technique development substudies . These study lay groundwork new experimental paradigm , use method approve protocol , test substudies list . - Training investigator . These study do train new investigator technique relevant study protocol . Study Population Three group study participant enrol : - MS patient . Participants definite , probable , possible MS. - Patient control . Participants diseases share feature MS. - Healthy volunteer . Design We design small substudies idea arise course work pertinent theme pathophysiology MS ( disease share feature MS ) . If hypothesis test sub-study lead result interest large population necessary reach statistical significance , separate protocol submit priori hypothesis , specific study design power analysis adapt pilot exploratory substudies perform present protocol . Outcome Measures These include MRI , clinical , biological outcome measure consistent objective study investigator . Imaging measure focus feature related central nervous system ( CNS ) , particularly focal lesion . Clinical measure include standard establish MS disability scale well quantitative measure relate function . Biological measure include genotype , gene expression , proteomics , virological study , immunological profiling .</detailed_description>
