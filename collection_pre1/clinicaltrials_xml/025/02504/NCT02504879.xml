	<brief_summary>Background : - The rare disease melorheostosis cause bone thicken . This may lead pain , affect bone , joint , muscle . Researchers want learn disease progress . Objective : -To see happens people melorheostosis time understand cause disease . Eligibility : - People 18 melorheostosis . - Their unaffected relative . Design : - All participant medical history physical exam . - Participants relatives give sample blood cheek cell . - Other participant study 1 week . - They blood urine collect . - Strength , walking , range motion measure . - Participants may also - X-rays scan . - A pain neurological evaluation . - Their skin evaluate dermatologist . - A small sample bone take . - Nerve conduction study . Small electrodes wire put skin . A metal probe give small electrical shock . - Electromyography . A thin needle place muscle . - An ultrasound , use sound wave examine muscle nerve . An ultrasound probe place skin . - A bone scan . They get small amount radioactive fluid needle arm vein . This fluid travel bone . The bone photograph machine . - Bone Densitometry , low-level x-ray . - Photographs take . - A small circle skin remove surgical instrument . - Questionnaires quality life . - Participants ask return every 2 year . At visit , participant may blood urine test x-ray .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Melorheostosis rare osteosclerotic disease result exuberant excessive bone growth characteristic radiographic appearance often describe `` drip candle wax '' . As result bony formation , patient report mild-moderate pain interferes routine activity . It usually diagnose radiographs bone biopsy may perform exclude osteosclerotic disease and/or osteosarcoma . Deformities , limb-length discrepancy , muscle atrophy , neurological deficit report complication . The cause disease know , natural history poorly describe clearly-defined systemic therapy . We propose prospective observational study investigate natural history pathogenesis disease . Some subject undergo standardized initial evaluation medically indicate test . Affected tissue send genetic test pursue hypothesis melorheostosis result acquire somatic mutation gene control bone homeostasis . Enrolled subject follow annual biannual basis assessment disease progression receive clinically indicated test treatment . The study rare bone disease offer potential generate new insight , provide answer well generate new question biology skeletal mineral metabolism .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : All eligible patient invited participate protocol . Patients adult age &gt; 18 year possible melorheostosis ( suspect confirm ) . Since men woman affect disease , sex study . All ethnic racial group risk include . Relatives patient melorheostosis may include genetic testing . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Pregnant lactate woman . A pregnancy test perform woman childbearing potential ( age 55 ) unless history hysterectomy tubal ligation . Children ( age le 18 year ) exclude . Subjects severe active infection comorbidities opinion investigator would warrant exclusion . Subjects unable provide inform consent .</criteria>
