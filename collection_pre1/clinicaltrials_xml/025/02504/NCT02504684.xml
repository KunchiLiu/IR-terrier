	<brief_summary>Objective : Compare venous occlusion rate one-year follow-up compare 1920-nm versus 1470-nm laser treatment . Design : Non-randomized prospective study . Methods : Adult patient varicose vein associate great saphenous reflux include . Procedures perform February April 2013 . The 1470-nm laser ablation perform continuous mode , power set 8 10 W , 1920-nm set 5 6 W. Checking vein closure perform thermal ablation procedure , LEED ( linear endovenous energy density ) calculate procedure . Follow-up data collect 7-day , 30-day , 3-month , 6-month 1-year visit , involved clinical ultrasound evaluation , measurement occlusion extent .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Saphenous Vein Reflux With 1920-nm Diode Laser</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION The treatment varicose vein secondary saphenous vein reflux undergone major shift past decade , primarily lead introduction less invasive technique . Wavelengths 810 , 940 980 nm high rate absorption hemoglobin . Water chromophore associate initial energy absorption peak 980 nm , follow peak 1500 2000 nm . The energy release vein lumen therefore absorb water well cellular interstitial protein . In contrast , laser beam longer wavelength act specifically water absorbance , result less energy expenditure , case 1470-nm diode endolaser . An endoluminal energy density ( LEED ) around 50-160 J/cm demonstrate effectively lead venous occlusion , although LEEDs 100 J/cm also associate high complication rate . In contrast , 1920-nm diode laser specific water hemoglobin chromophore , tissue absorption wavelength least 2.5 time great one obtain 1470-nm laser . It therefore expect less energy would require generate amount venous closure . The aim study compare diode 1920-nm versus 1470-nm laser treatment great saphenous vein reflux . The primary outcome venous segment occlusion one-year follow-up . Secondary outcome include LEED , postoperative complication , clinical outcome measure Clinical , Etiology , Anatomical Pathological classification ( CEAP ) , Venous Clinical Severity Score ( VCSS ) patient satisfaction scale . METHODS This prospective study evaluate result 1920-nm vs. 1470-nm laser . Patients agree participate offer informed consent , recruitment occur February April 2013 . Participants enrol February mid-March 2013 underwent treatment 1470-nm laser , enrol mid-March April underwent treatment 1920-nm laser . Patients 18 70 year old varicose vein associate reflux great saphenous vein include . The exclusion criterion : patient previous history thrombophlebitis , deep vein thrombosis undergone previous surgery condition , thermal ablation sclerotherapy . For bilateral case , limb treat surgical session . Data clinical history , physical examination , CEAP classification , VCSS ( Venous Clinical Severity Score ) VDS ( Venous Disability Score ) collect . The extent great saphenous reflux measure along main diameter level saphenofemoral junction well knee level . Reflux define retrograde reach speed great 3 cm/second Valsalva maneuver leg compression maneuver . All patient underwent procedure spinal anesthesia . The great saphenous vein puncture distal point reflux 6F introducer position . All case conduct 600-micron radial fiber position 2.0 3.0 cm saphenofemoral junction . A tumescence 0.9 % saline solution place ultrasound guidance around full length saphenous vein . All patient 30-degree Trendelenburg position . Surgical procedure involve saphenous ablation phlebectomy . Saphenous ablation 1470-nm laser perform continuous mode , power 8 10 W , determine function diameter vessel well surgeon 's preference . The 1920-nm laser also use continuous mode , 5 6 W power . Vein closure monitor thermal ablation procedure conduct ultrasound pulling-off fiber . At end procedure , total amount energy use limb record LEED calculation , measure total energy use limb ( J ) vein length ( cm ) . First follow-up occur postoperative week one , subsequent evaluation 30 day , three month , six month one year . At assessment , symptom record ultrasound evaluation perform . Patient satisfaction evaluate 1-week following question `` Are satisfied surgery ? '' `` Would choose treatment ? '' Both question present Likert scale 0 = satisfy , 1 = satisfy , 2 = indifferent , 3 = satisfy , 4 = dissatisfy . The primary endpoint study percentage occlude venous segment 6-month follow-up . Extension occlude saphenous vein segment measure visit tape guide ultrasound determine occlusion point . A segment consider patent compressible reflux muscle compression stand position . The length occlude vein segment compare length segment thermal ablation perform , thus allow u calculate segment closure percentage . Secondary end-points presence ecchymosis , induration , paresthesia , skin burn deep vein thrombosis .</detailed_description>
