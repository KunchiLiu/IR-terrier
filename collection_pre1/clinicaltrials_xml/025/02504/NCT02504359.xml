	<brief_summary>This phase Ib trial study side effect combination chemotherapy donor stem cell transplant follow ixazomib citrate maintenance therapy treat patient multiple myeloma return period improvement likely recur ( come back ) , spread . Giving chemotherapy donor peripheral blood stem cell transplant help stop growth cell bone marrow , include normal blood-forming cell ( stem cell ) cancer cell . When healthy stem cell donor infused patient may help patient 's bone marrow make stem cell , red blood cell , white blood cell , platelet . Giving ixazomib citrate transplant may improve overall treatment outcome without cause additional toxicity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Safety BEAM ( carmustine , cytarabine , etoposide , melphalan ) allogeneic transplant within 100 day , define day 100 transplant relate mortality ( TRM ) . II . Safety oral ixazomib maintenance therapy day 100 post allogeneic transplant 2 year , define incidence grade III-IV acute ( overlap ) graft-versus-host disease ( GvHD ) grade III-IV ixazomib related toxicity . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess proportion patient eligible start ixazomib maintenance therapy . II . To determine incidence discontinuation ixazomib maintenance therapy one two year post initiation . III . To determine response rate ( complete response [ CR ] , good partial response [ VGPR ] partial response [ PR ] ) day 100 12 24 month transplant . IV . To determine two year progression-free survival overall survival rate . V. To evaluate time engraftment ( define absolute neutrophil count [ ANC ] &gt; 500 platelet &gt; 20,000 ) . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine rate minimal residual disease deep sequencing ( ClonoSIGHT , Sequenta ) . II . To estimate cumulative incidence disease progression rate . III . To determine rate &gt; = grade 3 toxicity use Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version 4.03 . IV . To determine incidence treatment emergent peripheral neuropathy ( grade ) . V. To determine cumulative incidence severity chronic GvHD . VI . To determine cumulative incidence grade III-IV acute GvHD . VII . To evaluate health relate quality life . VIII . To determine donor recipient chimerism . IX . To evaluate immune reconstitution . OUTLINE : BEAM CONDITIONING REGIMEN : Patients receive carmustine day -6 , cytarabine etoposide day -5 -2 , melphalan day -1 . PERIPHERAL BLOOD STEM CELL TRANSPLANT : Patients undergo allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation day 0 . GVHD PROPHYLAXIS : Patients receive tacrolimus intravenously ( IV ) orally ( PO ) day -2 least 6 month taper early 3 month post-transplant methotrexate IV day 1 , 3 , 6 , 11 . MAINTENANCE THERAPY : Beginning day 100 180 post-transplant , patient receive ixazomib PO day 1 14 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 24 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 4 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
