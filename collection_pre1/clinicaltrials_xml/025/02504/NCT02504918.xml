	<brief_summary>Background : - The disease malaria cause serious health problem . Researchers want see malaria affect way T cell vaccine work body . If , may need give malaria treatment vaccine . They want check T cell child get antimalarial treatment . Objectives : - To study effect blood stage malaria T cell suppression vaccine response . To describe marker T cell suppression child receive antimalarial treatment . Eligibility : - Children age 12 59 month live near Ouelessebougou Mali . They must serious illness . Design : - Participants screen medical history physical exam . - Some participant get course antimalarial tablet . Some . This decide random . - Participants monthly visit year . They blood test visit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Markers T Cell Suppression : Associations With Malaria Infection Antimalarial Treatment Malian Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Malaria cause Plasmodium falciparum continue global problem devastate consequence . New intervention need combat malaria , progress make development vaccine : subunit vaccine call RTSS confers partial protection clinical malaria child nearing licensure ; whole organism product call PfSPZ Vaccine confer sterile protection infection , undergoing field trial . NIAID involved field trial PfSPZ Vaccine vaccine , key question vaccine trial design whether concurrent parasitemia impair vaccine response . The primary hypothesis study T cell suppression regulation decrease follow antimalarial treatment clear blood stage parasite extend period time . Up 200 child recruit longitudinal study conduct Ouelessebougou neighbor village Mali . In August 2015 , 50 child present Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention ( SMC ) village government implement SMC enrol , well 50 age-matched child reside adjacent village SMC implement government Mali ; follow rainy season . In January 2016 , 100 healthy child Ouelessebougou village area enrol randomize receive receive course artemether-lumefantrine , follow duration dry season ( Jan-Jun 2016 ) subsequent rainy season ( Jul-Dec 2016 ) . Samples cohort study ( age-matched SMC study ; randomize artemether-lumefantrine study ) collect child time monthly visit assess ex vivo assay marker T cell suppression primary outcome study . For secondary outcome , examine level regulatory T cell , measure T cell response stimulation assay , survey parasitemia blood smear polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) assay . We expect level T cell suppression regulatory T cell similar group antimalarial treatment malaria infection , treatment subject remain uninfected level significantly low compare untreated infected subject .</detailed_description>
