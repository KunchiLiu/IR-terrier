	<criteria>The patient man woman 18 70 year age establish diagnosis SLE define ACR Classification Revised Criteria . The diagnosis fulfil provide least 4 criterion meet . The patient positive test result ANA screening ( titer must least 1:80 [ human epithelial cell tumor line ( HEp2 ) ANA assay ] ) and/or positive test result antidsDNA Ab screening ( value must 30 IU/mL enzymelinked immunosorbent assay [ ELISA ] ) . Written inform consent obtain . Women must surgically sterile , 2 year postmenopausal , , childbearing potential , use medically accept method contraception , must agree continue use method duration study 30 day discontinuation study drug treatment . Acceptable method contraception include barrier method spermicide , abstinence ( line prefer usual lifestyle subject ) , intrauterine device ( IUD ) , steroidal contraceptive ( oral , transdermal , implanted , inject ) conjunction barrier method . The patient SLEDAI2K clinical score least 6 point screen . A SLEDAI2K clinical score calculate score without inclusion point may contribute positive titer antidsDNA Ab decrease serum complement level . The patient `` A '' score BILAG2004 scale . If patient use oral corticosteroid , weekly cumulative dose must exceed 80 mg prednisone equivalent ; weekly dose must stable 4 week precede 1st dose study drug . If patient use antimalarial , methotrexate , leflunomide , mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) , azathioprine , start date must least 3 month prior 1st dose study drug , daily dose must stable 4 week precede 1st dose study drug . If patient currently use corticosteroid , antimalarial , methotrexate , MMF , azathioprine , last dose ( case previous use ) must least 4 week prior 1st dose study drug . For leflunomide , stop date must least 8 week 1st dose study drug unless adequate cholestryamine washout perform . If cholestyramine washout perform , last use leflunomide must least 4 week 1st dose study drug . The patient must willing able comply study restriction , remain study center require duration study visit , return study center final assessment specify protocol . The patient treat intramuscular intravenous ( iv ) pulse steroid ( ie , 250 1000 mg iv total daily dose methylprednisolone ) within 4 week 1st dose study drug . The use intraarticular steroid may allow consultation medical expert . The patient receive tacrolimus , cyclosporin A , iv immunoglobulin ( IVIG ) within 3 month 1st dose study drug . The patient receive cyclophosphamide within 6 month prior 1st dose study drug . The patient treat SLE agent fusion protein , therapeutic protein , monoclonal antibody antibody fragment , within 6 month 1st dose study drug . The patient receive Bcell deplete agent rituximab , belimumab epratuzumab within one year 1st dose yet normalize Bcell count ( ie , CD20+ Bcell count less normal range absolute lymphocyte count [ ALC ] less normal range ) . The patient New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class III IV congestive heart failure . The patient estimate glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) less 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 ( via Modification Diet Renal Disease [ MDRD ] equation ) . The patient aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) value great 2 time upper limit normal range ( ULN ) total bilirubin level great 1.5 time ULN . The patient plan immunization live live attenuated vaccine within 3 month prior administration 1st dose study drug 3 month administration last dose study drug . The patient clinically significant abnormality ECG relate SLE , determine investigator . Patients stable ECG change without evidence active cardiovascular disease may participate discretion investigator medical monitor . The patient ongoing active systemic infection require treatment history severe infection , hepatitis pneumonia , 3 month prior administration 1st dose study drug . Less severe infection 3 month prior administration 1st dose study drug permit discretion investigator medical monitor . The patient concomitant medical condition unrelated SLE may interfere safety evaluation study drug , determine investigator . The patient history medical condition SLE require treatment oral corticosteroid excess 80 mg prednisone equivalent/week within 3 month 1st dose study drug . The patient positive test result hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) hepatitis C virus antibody ( HCV Ab ) . The patient know positive history antibody human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) HIV disease immunosuppressive state ( eg , agammaglobulinemia , etc ) . The patient history alcohol substance dependence abuse ( exception nicotine ) , accord Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders American Psychiatric Association , Fourth Edition , Text Revision ( DSMIVTR ) , within 3 month screen visit current substance abuse . The patient history severe allergic reaction hypersensitivity component study drug placebo . The patient undergone undergoing treatment another investigational drug treatment lupus within 6 month prior 1st dose study drug receive investigational drug condition within 4 week prior 1st dose study drug . The patient previously participate ImmuPharma ImmuPharmasponsored clinical study IPP201101 . The patient pregnant lactate woman . ( Any woman become pregnant study withdrawn study . ) The patient unlikely comply study protocol unsuitable reason , judge investigator medical monitor .</criteria>
