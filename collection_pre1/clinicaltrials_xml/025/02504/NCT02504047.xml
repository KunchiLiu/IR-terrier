	<brief_summary>The administration high-dose chemotherapy follow infusion blood bone marrow stem cell ( stem cell transplantation ) match donor become standard treatment patient high-risk relapsed hematological cancer . Currently , donor find approximately 80 % people require treatment , although chance find donor much low ethnic community . In current study investigator offer patient require transplantation , well match donor identify either within family donor registry , transplant half-matched ( haploidentical ) family member . A myeloablative conditioning regimen un-manipulated peripheral blood stem cell use . Post-transplant cyclophosphamide , tacrolimus mycophenolate mofetil use prevent graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) . The primary outcome measure 6 month survival free graft failure , relapse grade 3-4 acute GVHD . Other outcomes interest include frequency Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) Epstein-Barr Virus ( EBV ) require treatment , overall survival progression-free survival .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>A hematological malignancy acute leukemia myelodysplastic syndrome require hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . A haploidentical family member willing donate . Suitable performance status , organ function ( define locally ) disease status transplantation . Patients acute leukemia must morphological complete remission . Patients chronic myelogenous leukemia must chronic phase lymphoma must chemosensitive disease ( least partial remission recent chemotherapy regimen ) . Given write , inform consent participate clinical trial . An 8/8 match sibling donor match unrelated donor ( base highresolution type appropriate ) , available within time frame acceptable treat physician Patients available single allele single antigen mismatch donor ( 7/8 9/10 ) available cord blood donor include discretion treat team , accord local institutional practice . Prior allogeneic transplant Any exclusion criterion allogeneic stem cell transplant , define program . Examples typically include pregnancy , significant comorbidity , active uncontrolled infection .</criteria>
