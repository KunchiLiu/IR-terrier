	<brief_summary>Background : - Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) often cause problem move balance , think emotion . Exercise improve thing people brain damage . Researchers want look effect exercise thing people TBI . Objectives : - To study head injury affect brain . To study exercise help symptom people TBI . These include problem think , balance , move , depression anxiety . Eligibility : - People age 18 79 : - Had non-penetrating TBI least 12 month ago . - Are physically inactive , stand walk without help . Design : - Participants screen medical history , physical exam , blood urine test . They may balance test . - Participants assign high-intensity lower-intensity exercise program . - The study 6 month long . There 3 month exercise elliptical machine 3 month without exercise . - Participants exercise 30 minute elliptical machine , 3 day per week 3 month . - Participants also 3 outpatient test visit last approximately 8 hour , every 3 month . This visit include : - Blood test - Tests memory , attention , think - Tests walk balance - Questionnaires - An MRI : lie machine take picture brain , breathe regular air air carbon dioxide - Test physical fitness .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective The broad objective study examine effect moderate intense aerobic exercise intervention cognitive performance , physical function health-related quality life patient chronic ( 12 month post-injury ) traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) . Importantly , structural biological brain change measure examine whether functional outcome related exercise-induced adaptation . It hypothesize chronic phase person TBI , improve : 1 ) cognitive function , 2 ) physical fitness fatigue severity , 3 ) motor performance balance , 4 ) mood depressive symptom , perform exercise intervention compare control group . It also hypothesize functional improvement related exercise intensity , improved cortical connectivity , dopamine transmission gene score , blood biomarkers related neuroand angio-genesis . Study Population 80 ambulatory adult non-penetrating TBI enrol . Subjects recruit NIH , affiliate hospitals/clinics community . Design All subject perform baseline assessment include cognitive behavioral performance , brain imaging , fitness , motor balance testing , select blood genetic testing . Thereafter , subject randomize either waitlist control , one two exercise condition : 1 ) 30 minute fast pace , moderate-intensity ( rapidresistive exercise ; RET ) ; 2 ) 30 minute higher-intensity ( aerobic exercise ; AET ) . Both exercise group perform exercise elliptical trainer 3 time week , session duration 45 minute include warm-up cool-down . The RET group focus rapid reciprocal motion minimal resistance , AET group exercise elevate intensity know produce aerobic effect . After 12 week , group repeat baseline assessment ( 3 month follow-up ) . Following assessment , waitlist control group randomize either RET AET exercise group cease formal supervise exercise session . A third assessment visit perform additional 12 week ( 6 month follow-up ) . Outcome Measures Cognitive performance test interpreted compare norm . Performance motor balance task assess Smart Balance Measurement System GAITRite System . Physical fitness determine peak oxygen consumption aerobic threshold measure pulmonary gas exchange exercise tolerance test treadmill . Structural brain volume determine magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) cortical connectivity quantify use rest state functional MRI Diffusion Tensor Imaging ( DTI ) evaluate integrity change white matter tract response exercise . Blood collect quantify presence biomarkers ( VEGF , BDNF IGF-1 ) dopamine transmission . Other self-reported measure quality life , fatigue severity , depression sleep quality would also collect .</detailed_description>
