	<detailed_description>Purpose : The purpose study evaluate effectiveness 3-month control-theory-based online support intervention consist 8 online video teleconsultations access secure online personal health record self-management behaviour adult type 2 diabetes , measure Summary Diabetes Self-Care Activities ( SDSCA ) . Secondary outcome include glycemic control , BMI , waist circumference , diabetes self-efficacy , computer health literacy , patient satisfaction care perceive ease use perceive usefulness technology . Hypothesis : Patients receive online support diabetes self-management access online personal health record high self-management diabetes score receive intervention compare intervention . Justification : In British Columbia ( BC ) , estimate 10.3 percent population expect diabetes 2020 , estimate cost BC healthcare system 1.9 billion dollar per year . Enhancing diabetes self-management estimate single cost-effective intervention primary care set . Results telemedicine intervention management diabetes mixed ; many intervention show promising improvement health behaviour , self-efficacy glycaemic control , others show small effect . A 2015 meta-analysis clinical effectiveness telemedicine randomize control trial type 2 diabetes find significant decrease HbA1C overall , large decrease amongst Internet-based intervention . A recent Cochrane systematic review meta-analysis computer-based self-management intervention adult type 2 diabetes find intervention use mobile phone show great reduction glycaemic control telehealth intervention overall . A meta-regression technique 122 healthy eat physical activity self-management intervention diabetes find self-monitoring explain great amount among-study heterogeneity , account 13 % difference . Self-monitoring component control theory , propose order effectively manage behaviour , must clear , realistic goal , action plan attain , mean monitor whether person track , feedback , opportunity review goal light feedback . Providing additional information behavioural provider online personal health record , integrate behavioural support ongoing primary care share action plan , effectiveness behavioural support provide online may increase . Standard treatment primarily involve management diabetes medication may involve referral diabetes education centre education diabetes self-management . The best method support patient self-management clearly identify . Objectives : The specific outcome examine self-management type II diabetes measure Summary Diabetes Self-Care Activities ( SDSCA ) . Research Method : A pre-post intervention study multicentre cohort 125 patient provide online support intervention follow three month evaluate change diabetes self-management behaviour clinical outcome . We recruit total 125 patient type 2 diabetes 12 participate primary care physician . After consent obtain , participant provide training use glucometer , online video teleconsultation tool online personal health record .

Participants also give glucose meter ( Bayer ContourÂ® Next meter ) glucose reading uploaded online personal health record . The patient use glucometer strip provide BC government prescription plan . Data Collection : The primary outcome change diabetes self-management behaviour measure Summary Diabetes Self-Care Activities ( SDSCA ) include diet , exercise , self-monitoring blood glucose , foot care smoking . Secondary outcome include change HbA1C , BMI waist circumference , diabetes self-efficacy , satisfaction care , acceptance use technology online support . ( See attach document : Measurement Instruments ) The primary care provider access patient 's online information , include self-monitored glucose value , review . Participants complete online questionnaire baseline end study . Sample Size Calculation : The statistical power study model two-tailed paired sample t-test test change SDSCA baseline three month . Published study use SDSCA show effect sizes change intervention group range .278 .53 . Thus , conservatively estimate effect size .278 , achieve 80 % power p &lt; .05 significance level , sample 125 participant require , assume 20 % longitudinal attrition rate . Attrition rate 10 % 20 % range report previous similar Web-based intervention study . Data Analysis : Two-tailed paired sample t-tests perform test change mean self-management behaviour baseline three month . Correlations explore relation outcome variable health literacy , computer literacy control variables . Changes across time secondary outcome ( clinical outcome , diabetes self-efficacy ) also examine use paired-sample t-tests explore trend effect size future study . All test perform use SPSS version 23 , p &lt; .05 significance level .</detailed_description>
