	<brief_title>Study Platelet Activation Severe Aortic Stenosis Its Correction Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Background : TAVI emerge alternative surgical aortic valve replacement patient severe , symptomatic aortic stenosis ( AS ) expand worldwide 50,000 patient treated date . - Purpose Changes haemostasis , particularly platelet activation reactivity , TAVI never study . Valve replacement know alleviate von Willebrand factor abnormality associate AS . A potential improvement platelet function could also occur TAVI . Indeed , circulate platelet may desensitize under-reactive due multiple passage stenotic valve could recover normal reactivity TAVI . Besides , TAVI present risk major ischemic complication . The investigator hypothesize involvement high reactive platelet peri-procedural thrombotic ischemic event . This study platelet activation kinetics perform compare several specific marker various time valve implantation . - Primary outcome To evaluate kinetics platelet activation various time valve implantation , compare several specific marker peripheral venous blood sample ( day 0 ) day 1 5Â±1 procedure . - Study design number subject : This prospective , monocentric , study . The test group include 15 patient treated transfemoral TAVI use MedTronic CoreValve ( MCV ) prosthesis . Platelet activation study procedure compare reference establish age-matched , aspirin-treated , atherosclerotic population ( 30 patient control group ) . - Eligibility criterion : - inclusion criterion : test group : patient severe aortic stenosis transfemoral TAVI MCV aspirin treatment . Control group : age-matched patient stable coronary artery disease treat aspirin without aortic stenosis . - exclusion criterion : recent ( 1 month ) acute coronary syndrome ; treatment anti platelet agent aspirin - Procedures : Specific platelet activation marker , circulate platelet/monocytes aggregate , platelet reactivity vWF assess peripheral venous blood , 1 5 day TAVI ascend aorta procedure .</detailed_description>
