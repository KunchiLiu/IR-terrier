	<brief_summary>Currently , continuous adductor canal popliteal-sciatic nerve block use commonly low extremity post-operative pain control , specifically total knee arthroplasty foot/ankle surgery , respectively . A perineural catheter use infuse local anesthetic postoperative analgesia may place various location along target nerve . Investigations single-injection peripheral nerve block suggest onset block might faster one location ; , success rate equivalent . However , remain unknown whether optimal location place perineural catheter part continuous peripheral nerve block .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This single-center ( UCSD ) , randomize , control investigation . Enrollment . Consenting adult undergo knee arthroplasty foot/ankle surgery plan adductor canal popliteal perineural catheter , respectively , offer enrollment . Study inclusion propose eligible patient prior surgery . If patient desire study participation , write , informed consent obtain use current UCSD IRB-approved ICF . Selection inclusion base gender , race , socioeconomic status . Inclusion exclusion criterion list section # 10 . Preoperative Procedures . Following write , informed consent , The Investigators record baseline anthropomorphic information ( age , sex , height , weight ) already provide patient surgery . All subject peripheral intravenous ( IV ) catheter insert , standard noninvasive monitor apply , supplemental oxygen administer via nasal cannula face mask , position supine ( adductor canal ) prone ( popliteal-sciatic ) . Midazolam fentanyl ( IV ) titrate patient comfort , ensure patient remain responsive verbal cue . The area subsequently cover catheter dress clip hair , necessary . The ultrasound place visualize short axis ( cross-section ) adductor canal popliteal regional proximal distal location . If site acceptable catheter insertion , subject randomize use computer-generated list ( block 8 ) one two treatment group 1:1 ratio use seal , opaque , consecutively numbered envelope stratify catheter type ( adductor canal vs. popliteal-sciatic ) : ( 1 ) proximal v ( 2 ) distal insertion . Catheter insertion . Catheter insertion adhere current UCSD standard-of-care . The difference subject participate study ( v participate ) specific catheter insertion location—both currently standard-of-care use daily UCSD clinical equipoise—will determine randomly , instead physician simply choose him/herself . All catheter place regional anesthesia fellow resident direct supervision guidance regional anesthesia attending ( attend him/herself ) . All catheter place use standard UCSD perineural catheter technique , nerve short-axis , ultrasound-guidance . The area insertion clean chlorhexidine gluconate isopropyl alcohol ( ChloraPrep One-Step , Medi-Flex Hospital Products , Inc. , Overland Park , KS , USA ) , clear , sterile , fenestrated drape apply . The ultrasound probe place visualize short-axis ( cross-section ) target nerve ( ) . A skin wheal raise catheter-placement needle 's anticipated point entry ( proximal distal location ) . A 17 gauge needle ( FlexTip , Teleflex Medical , Triangle Research Park , NC , USA ) use place perineural catheter . The catheter-placement needle insert skin wheal , advance in-plane beneath US transducer direct target nerve describe : Adductor canal . Proximal : Inserted describe previously : `` …we perform ultrasound survey medial part thigh , halfway superior anterior iliac spine [ superior border ] patella . In short axis view , identify femoral artery underneath sartorius muscle , vein inferior saphenous nerve lateral artery . '' Distal : Inserted describe previously : `` The transducer initially place medial aspect distal third thigh identify femoral artery immediately deep sartorius muscle . The transducer move caudally along long axis thigh femoral artery see dive deep move away anterior muscle plane ( sartorius vastus medialis muscle ) , toward posterior aspect thigh becomes popliteal artery . This area identify adductor hiatus , block location select 2 3 cm proximally area , distal adductor canal . '' Saline ( 10 mL ) administer via needle dilate space catheter insert . A flexible non-stimulating perineural catheter ( FlexTip , Arrow International , Reading , PA , USA ) insert 3-5 cm past needle tip ; needle withdraw catheter . A 30 mL bolus lidocaine 2 % 1:400,000 epinephrine administer though catheter . A `` successful '' catheter insertion define decreased sensation cold within distribution saphenous nerve . Popliteal-sciatic . Using ultrasound , bifurcation sciatic nerve identify short axis mark point immediately distal point two main branch sciatic nerve separate hypoechoic area view two . This level mark skin . Proximal : The needle insert intersect sciatic nerve 6-7 cm proximal mark skin ( therefore , proximal sciatic bifurcation ) injection saline use ensure subepimyseal spread . Distal : The needle tip insert hypoechoic area two branch sciatic nerve immediately distal sciatic nerve bifurcation paraneurium epineurium ( subparaneural space/compartment ) . As described previously : `` An adequate position define presence circular expansion paraneural sheath ... Once circular expansion obtain , injected . During injection process , Tuohy needle keep stationary care take ensure neural swell occur . The latter define increase cross-sectional surface nerve . If neural swell detected US , needle carefully withdraw resume injection . '' A 40 mL bolus normal saline lidocaine 2 % 1:400,000 epinephrine give though needle . A flexible non-stimulating perineural catheter ( FlexTip , Arrow International , Reading , PA , USA ) insert 3-5 cm past needle tip ; needle withdraw catheter . If saline administer pre-operatively , 40 mL lidocaine 2 % 1:400,000 epinephrine administer catheter follow surgery . A `` successful '' catheter insertion define decrease cutaneous sensation cold plantar aspect foot . Intraop : Patients may receive general and/or neuraxial anesthetic would determine intraoperative anesthesia provider . Additional boluses 10 mL 2 % lidocaine epinephrine may give , need , via perineural catheter . Perineural infusion : An infusion pump attach subject 's perineural catheter . The pump provide ropivacaine 0.2 % 8 mL/h ( adductor ) 6 mL/h ( popliteal ) basal rate infusion 4 mL patient-controlled bolus 30 minute lockout ( standard UCSD ) . Data collection : All data collection standard UCSD nursing/therapy EPIC note ( adductor canal ) postoperative phone call ( popliteal ) day follow surgery . Primary endpoint : The primary endpoint average pain post operative day 1 follow surgery measure numeric rating scale ( 0-10 , 0=no pain , 10=worst imaginable pain ) time period 08:00-24:00 ( adductor ) two hour precede data-collection phone call ( popliteal ) . Secondary endpoint : Popliteal subject call day follow surgery collect information regard surgical pain ( Numeric Rating Scale 0 10 , `` 0 '' pain `` 10 '' bad pain ever experience ) , analgesic use ( oral , IV , infusion bolus ) , infusion side effect , distance ambulate ( adductor catheter ) . Popliteal subject call one week ( +/- 1 day ) follow surgery inquire possible block-related complication . Sample size estimate : Adductor canal . The primary analysis utilize Wilcoxon Rank Sum test . The figure show estimate density post-op day 1 pain score follow Proximal insertion ( mean = 4.12 , SD = 1.74 ) base publish data.10 To simulate power , The Investigators use truncated Gaussian distribution range 0 10 ; SD=1.74 ; Proximal group mean = 4.12 ; Distal group mean = 5 , 5.5 , 6 , 6.5 , 7 , 6.5 , 8 . Under assumption two-sided = 5 % , The Investigators simulate 10,000 trial sample size 25 per group primary end point measurement . The Investigators find simulated power plot [ clinicaltrials.gov support figure location ] . So The Investigators 80 % power detect group difference pain small 1.52 . Popliteal-sciatic . Using expected NRS mean=2.6 SD=2.1 average pain postoperative day 1 ( base unpublished data IRB study # 101282 ) , approximately 31 subject treatment arm primary end point measurement require detect difference treatment group mean 1.5 . This 2-sided alpha=0.05 , beta=0.2 , power=0.8 ( ClinCalc.com access June 28 , 2015 ) . The Investigators employ t-test parametric data Wilcoxon Rank Sum test non-parametric data . With two location combine , The Investigators need 112 subject primary end point measurement ; , The Investigators enroll 150 subject account drop-outs subject without primary end point measurement . ** Of great importance : popliteal-sciatic adductor canal data analyze report completely separately -- NOT combined time .</detailed_description>
