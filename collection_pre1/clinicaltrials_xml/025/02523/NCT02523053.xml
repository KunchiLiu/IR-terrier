	<brief_title>Effect Intraoperative Controlled Release 5-Fluorouracil Therapy Recurrence Hepatocellular Carcinoma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Surgical resection major curative treatment patient hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) . However , postoperative 5-year recurrence rate surgical resection significantly high , report 40 % -70 % . Recurrence surgery main factor affect efficacy management hepatocellular carcinoma , however , method prevention recurrence standard treatment recurrent HCC follow curative-intent initial surgery establish far . The effective prevention recurrence key improve management HCC . Previous study show prevalence microvascular invasion ( MVI ) one critical negative prognostic factor HCC patient partial hepatectomy liver transplantation . For early stage HCC patient , preoperative prediction MVI helpful identify appropriate object anti-recurrence treatment operation . Our another previous study establish nomogram MVI prediction early HCC patient , preoperative efficiently predict occurrence MVI within Milan criterion , publish online JAMA surgery . On hand , study report use control release 5-Fluorouracil treatment digestive tract tumor . The action time control release 5-Fluorouracil particle 15 day , diffusion radius 4-6cm . In theory , operation , drug give location may tumor residue , timely conveniently , long time maintain high drug concentration , conducive kill small metastatic focus cause MVI . However , best knowledge , evidence high level evidence-based medical evidence confirm value control release 5-Fluorouracil prevention HCC recurrence . In view , aim implement randomize control study confirm role intraoperative control release 5-Fluorouracil therapy prevention recurrence surgery HCC patient high risk preoperative prediction microvascular invasion .</detailed_description>
