	<brief_summary>The main study objective determine whether day night automate close loop glucose control combine pump suspend feature improve glucose control reduce burden hypoglycaemia compare sensor augment insulin pump therapy alone . This open-label , multi-centre , multi-national , single-period , randomise , parallel group design study , involve three-month period home study day night glucose level control either close loop system combine pump suspend feature ( intervention group ) sensor augment insulin pump therapy ( control group ) . It expect 100 subject , aim 84 randomised subject [ 42 youth ( 6 21 year ) , 42 adult ( 22 year old ) ] , type 1 diabetes recruit paediatric adult outpatient diabetes clinic investigation centre . Subjects drop within first four week intervention may replace . Participants subcutaneous insulin pump therapy proven competency use study insulin pump study CGM device . Subjects intervention group receive appropriate training safe use close loop insulin delivery system pump suspend feature . All subject regular contact study team home study phase include 24/7 telephone support . The primary outcome group difference time spend target glucose range 3.9 10.0 mmol/l ( 70 180mg/dl ) base CGM glucose level 12 week free living phase . Secondary outcome HbA1 end treatment period , time spend glucose level target , record CGM , CGM-based metric .

	<detailed_description>Purpose study : To determine whether day night automate close loop glucose control combine pump suspend feature improve glucose control measure glycated haemoglobin reduce burden hypoglycaemia compare sensor augment insulin pump therapy . Study objectives : 1 . EFFICACY : The objective ass efficacy day night automate close loop glucose control combine pump suspend feature maintain glucose level within target range 3.9 10.0mmol/l ( 70 180mg/dl ) base subcutaneous continuous glucose monitoring ( CGM ) , compare sensor augment insulin pump therapy . 2 . SAFETY : The objective evaluate safety day night automate close loop glucose control combine pump suspend feature , term episodes severe hypoglycaemia adverse event . 3 . UTILITY : The objective determine frequency duration use automate close loop system . 4 . PSYCHOSOCIAL : Subjects ' family member ' perception term life-style change , diabetes management fear hypoglycaemia assess use validated questionnaire semi-structured qualitative interview . Cognitive function assess use validated computerized cognitive test . Study design : An open-label , multi-centre , multi-national , randomised , single-period , parallel group study , contrast day night automate close loop glucose control combine pump suspend feature sensor augment insulin pump therapy Population : 84 participant randomise ( 42 youth 42 adult ) . Each centre aim recruit 05 20 participant . Maximum duration study subject : 18 week Recruitment : The subject recruit paediatric adult diabetes outpatient clinic centre . Consent : Written consent/assent obtain participant and/or guardian accord REC/IRB requirement . Screening assessment : Eligible participant undergo screen evaluation blood sample full blood count , renal , liver , thyroid function anti-transglutaminase antibody IgA level take ( do previous 3 month ) . Random C-peptide , glucose HbA1c also measure , urine pregnancy test females child-bearing potential . Questionnaires investigate participant ' quality life , psychosocial functioning response current treatment distribute . Cognitive assessment make use validated computerized cognitive test . Study Training : Training session use study CGM , insulin pump ( close loop system randomise intervention group ) provide research team . Training session use real-time CGM interpret real-time retrospective store data provide subjects/carers use write material . Run-in Period : During 4 week run-in period , subject use study CGM insulin pump . The research team contact subject weekly run-in period , subject also able contact research team support treatment optimisation necessary . For compliance ass ability subject use CGM study pump safely , least 12 day CGM data need record safe use study insulin pump demonstrate last 14 day run-in period . Competency assessment : Competency use study insulin pump study CGM evaluate use competency assessment tool develop research team . Further training may deliver require . Randomisation : Eligible subject randomise use randomisation software use real-time CGM pump suspend feature combine day night close loop sensor augment insulin pump therapy . 1 . Automated day night close loop insulin delivery ( intervention arm ) combine pump suspend feature ( interventional arm ) : At start , blood sample take measurement HbA1c urine pregnancy test females child-bearing potential . A subset participant interview enable historical diabetes management practice , everyday work family life , initial expectation use close loop technology capture explored in-depth . Subjects admit clinical facility Day 1 . Training use close loop pump suspend feature provide research team . During next 2-4 hour patient operate system supervision clinical team . Competency use close loop system evaluate . Subjects use closed loop pump suspend feature 12 week . 2 . Sensor augment insulin pump therapy ( control arm ) : A blood sample take measurement HbA1c urine pregnancy test females child-bearing potential . Subjects use sensor augment insulin pump therapy without pump suspend feature 12 week . End study assessment : - A blood sample take measurement HbA1c . - Validated questionnaire evaluate impact device employ life change , diabetes management complete . - Cognitive assessment make use validated computerized cognitive test . - Follow-up interview undertaken subset participants/family member end closed loop intervention . Procedures safety monitor trial : - Standard operating procedure monitor report adverse event place , include serious adverse event ( SAE ) , serious adverse device effect ( SADE ) specific adverse event ( AE ) severe hypoglycaemia . - Subjects ask test record blood urine ketone finger prick glucose 14.0mmol/l ( 250mg/dl ) morning waking , part safety assessment hyperglycaemia . - A data safety monitor board ( DSMB ) inform serious adverse event unanticipated serious adverse device effect occur study review compile adverse event data periodic interval . Criteria withdrawal patient safety ground : A subject , parent , guardian may terminate participation study time without necessarily give reason without personal disadvantage . An investigator stop participation subject consideration benefit/risk ratio . Possible reason : 1 . Serious adverse event 2 . Significant protocol violation non-compliance 3 . Failure satisfy competency assessment 4 . Decision investigator , sponsor , termination subject 's best medical interest 5 . Pregnancy , plan pregnancy , breast feeding 6 . Allergic reaction insulin 7 . Technical ground ( e.g . subject relocates )</detailed_description>
