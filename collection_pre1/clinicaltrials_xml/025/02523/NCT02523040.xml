	<brief_summary>This research study study chemotherapy drug Lenalidomide possible treatment one three histiocyte disorder : Langerhans cell histiocytosis ( LCH ) , Erdheim-Chester disease ( ECD ) , histiocytic sarcoma ( HS ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Lenalidomide Adult Histiocyte Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study Phase II clinical trial . Phase II clinical trial test safety effectiveness investigational intervention learn whether intervention work treat specific disease . `` Investigational '' mean intervention study . The FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve lenalidomide specific disease approve us . Lenalidomide chemotherapy drug belongs class drug call immunomodulatory drug ( IMiDs ) , modify participant 's immune response order treat cancer . Lenalidomide alter body 's immune system may also interfere development tiny blood vessel help support tumor growth . Therefore , may reduce prevent growth cancer cell . Lenalidomide show restore immune cell ' ability attack kill tumor cell Lenalidomide approve FDA treat certain cancer include multiple myeloma myelodysplastic syndrome .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must histologically cytologically confirm LCH , ECD HS . Confirmation outside pathology BWH perform mandatory prior study enrollment ( see section 3 ) . Detectable disease least one follow modality : CT , PET , bone scan , MRI . Patients LCH must require systemic therapy accord Histiocyte Society LCH Evaluation Treatment Guidelines ( HS 2009 ) Or Patients HS require systemic treatment define disease surgically resect and/or encompass single radiation field . Age 18 year old . ECOG performance status ≤2 ( Karnofsky ≥60 % , see Appendix A ) Participants must normal organ marrow function define : absolute neutrophil count ≥1,000/mcL platelets ≥100,000/mcL total bilirubin within 1.5 time normal institutional limit AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤3 × institutional upper limit normal creatinine within 2 time normal institutional limit OR creatinine clearance ≥30 mL/min/1.73 m2 . Note , dose adjustment require CrCl ≥30 mL/min ≤60 ml/min . Able take aspirin 81 mg daily prophylactic anticoagulation warfarin , low molecular weight heparin oral factor Xa inhibitor . Patients intolerant ASA may use warfarin low molecular weight heparin dos design treat deep venous thrombosis . All study participant must register mandatory Revlimid REMS® program , willing able comply requirement REMS® program . Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Prior chemotherapy radiation within 2 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 2 week earlier . Participants receive investigational agent . Prior treatment lenalidomide . Patients previously treat thalidomide discontinue treatment reason aside adverse reaction thalidomide permit . History another invasive malignancy unless treat curative intent 5 year prior study entry . Patients localized carcinoma cervix , nonmelanoma skin cancer , early stage prostate cancer require observation eligible regardless time diagnosis . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman exclude study lenalidomide know teratogenic effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother lenalidomide , breastfeed discontinue mother treated lenalidomide . Known active hepatitis B ( HBV ) hepatitis C ( HCV ) infection . Patients positive HBV surface antibody result prior vaccination eligible . Patients positive HBV core antibody undetectable HBV viral load eligible . HIVpositive participant combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction lenalidomide . In addition , participant increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Appropriate study undertake participant receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate . Concomitant corticosteroid unless patient stable dose prednisone ( equivalent ) ≤10 mg daily least 2 week prior first dose study drug . Inability swallow pill .</criteria>
