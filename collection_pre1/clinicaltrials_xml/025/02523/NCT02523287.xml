	<detailed_description>This study part BIOVACSAFE project , 5-year project fund Innovative Medicine Initiative , undertake series correlate clinical study apply develop technology generate clinical data inflammation license vaccine benchmark , identify biomarkers predict acceptable reactogenicity , correlation standardize clinical readout inflammatory marker assess natural infection . The purpose protocol generate set data analyse integrated system biology approach , validation subsequent clinical trial animal model . The dataset broadly characterise : 1 . Physiological response various time point immunisation measuring : 1 . Local systemic vaccine-related clinical event . 2 . Physiological assessment : heart rate , temperature , blood pressure . 3 . Haematology ( blood count ESR ) , biochemistry parameter . 2 . Metabolic , innate adaptive immune response include : 1 . Innate immune activation detect global gene expression whole blood 2 . Metabolic response detect metabolic gene expression pathway activation whole blood 3 . Adaptive immunity determine : i. Humoral immune response via serum anti-influenza HAI titre ii . Cellular immune response via enumeration HA-specific CD4+ T cell express activation marker and/or cytokine follow vitro stimulation analysis flow cytometry . d. Innate adaptive immune activation detect gene pathway activation whole blood e. Immune activation detect concentration select inflammatory soluble mediator serum include : i. chemokines cytokine ii . acute phase proteins 3 . Genetic test subject deem necessary ( genetic test analysis may SNIP analysis full genome analysis ) . 4 . Correlations change innate adaptive immune activation metabolism adverse event , haematology biochemistry panel , genotype physiological assessment The investigator biobank sample duration BIOVACSAFE programme investigator selectively analyse different sample different time point depend result generate , principally gene expression analysis whole blood .</detailed_description>
