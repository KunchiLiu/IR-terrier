	<brief_title>Immunotherapy With Nivolumab Nivolumab Plus Ipilimumab v . Double Placebo Stage IV Melanoma w. NED</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study allow direct comparison clinical benefit provide Nivolumab monotherapy Nivolumab combine Ipilimumab versus double placebo control . Furthermore , also allow direct comparison respective safety profile Nivolumab monotherapy Nivolumab combine Ipilimumab . Nivolumab monotherapy choose one experimental arm favourable risk-benefit ratio assess large Phase 1 study ( MDX1106-03/CA209-003 ) . The combination Nivolumab Ipilimumab choose experimental arm preliminary evidence Phase 1 study CA209-004 suggest synergy Nivolumab Ipilimumab result high frequency patient increase tumour burden reduction . Evaluating Nivolumab monotherapy combination Nivolumab Ipilimumab provide clinical data allow clinician select appropriate treatment patient base individual risk-benefit ratio .</detailed_description>
