	<detailed_description>A multicentre phase II study determine safety efficacy EUS-guided nCLE patient suspect cystic tumour pancreas endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration ( EUS-FNA ) clinically indicate . Patients recruit sequentially undergo nCLE part routine diagnostic evaluation , follow standard surveillance . This part study recruit 60 patient . The study also include feasibility study evaluate role intraoperative nCLE diagnosis stag pancreatic tumour . This part study recruit 20 patient . Primary endpoint : Assess diagnostic performance Cellvizio nCLE system characterization pancreatic cyst , compare standard diagnostic modality . Secondary endpoint : - Assess safety efficacy EUS-nCLE . - Assess impact Cellvizio nCLE system management patient pancreatic cyst . - Develop validate interpretation criterion nCLE pancreas . - Assess diagnostic performance nCLE characterise stag pancreatic tumour intraoperatively .</detailed_description>
