	<brief_summary>This electrogram mapping study test ability new signal processing technique call electrogram morphology recurrence map locate driver participant atrial fibrillation . This study also test hypothesis non-invasive marker predict driver location . Electrogram mapping perform participant undergo ablation persistent atrial fibrillation . These participant cardiac MRI 12-lead ECG prior ablation procedure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Utilizing Novel Method Map Sources Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) describe new emerge epidemic currently affect around 1 % population . Risk AF increase age elderly continue comprise large percentage population United States , health burden AF continue increase . Some estimate project nearly 16 million case AF US alone 2050 . The economic burden AF estimate $ 6-26 billion . AF significant risk factor stroke leave untreated well mortality . The diagnosis treatment AF therefore become important aspect cardiovascular medicine . Current pharmacological treatment AF modest efficacy suffer potentially life-threatening side effect . Current ablative surgical approach AF , though somewhat successful , use anatomic , 'one-size fit ' strategy ( minor variation ) address specific mechanisms underlying complex arrhythmia . The pulmonary vein show common location AF trigger . Thus , common approach catheter ablation involve isolation pulmonary vein , wide area circumferential pulmonary vein ablation strategy . The lack consideration specific source may , least part , responsible post- ablation arrhythmia occur 40 % patient undergo pulmonary vein ablation . However , ablation/surgical success show increase extensive ablation/surgery atrium , latter come cost significant `` collateral damage '' atrial myocardium well surround structure , accompany increase risk complication decrease atrial function . The time cost perform procedure also significant . Thus , catheter surgical ablation strategy tailor specific arrhythmia origin patient 's AF would significant impact ability treat arrhythmia . The investigator 's laboratory develop novel electrogram morphology recurrence analysis observe nonlinear dynamic AF activation . This technique map AF activation base hypothesis AF electrograms morphology highly recurrent short cycle lengths represent location stable AF source . The investigator 's preliminary data show high recurrence percentage short recurrence cycle length occur left atrium patient undergoing pulmonary vein-based ablation , patient much high chance stay sinus rhythm post-ablation high recurrence percentage short recurrence cycle length occur right atrium . Cycle length activation predictor outcome . High resolution electrical mapping AF canine atrium show short recurrence cycle length sit correspond area contain rotor . Thus , preliminary data provide strong evidence morphology recurrence map able identify location AF source .</detailed_description>
