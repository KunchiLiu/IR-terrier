	<brief_title>Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study Obese Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obese subject prone develop respiratory insufficiency require mechanical ventilation . Atelectasis primary responsible respiratory insufficiency impossibility wean obese patient respiratory support . The investigator believe respiratory system derangement observe previous study critical illness already present , although low severity , obese patient basal condition . This study help understand standard cardiac respiratory function obese non critically ill subject good target therapy management critical illness reestablish homeostasis system : The investigator 's hypothesis : - To demonstrate morbidly obese patient show atelectasis spontaneous breathe supine position whether increase lung volume follow PEEP titration due alveolar recruitment rather overdistention . - To measure regional variation ventilation/perfusion couple different ventilator setting - To investigate role diaphragm position development/treatment respiratory insufficiency due increase pleural pressure - To test reopen lung atelectasis application recruitment maneuver titrate PEEP level would lead improvement right heart function .</detailed_description>
