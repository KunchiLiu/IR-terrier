	<detailed_description>Introduction : Early detection timely intervention important determinant clinical outcome people acute illness . Adverse outcome include unplanned transfer intensive care ( ICU ) , cardiac arrest death usually precede acute physiological change manifest alteration vital sign . Usage early warning score ( EWS ) base bedside vital sign observation may help early detection , improve outcome patient reduce healthcare cost . Effectiveness EWS predict deterioration seriously ill patient demonstrate high income country ( HICs ) . However , score develop HICs show lose sensitivity specificity apply low income setting . It imperative explore usefulness EWSs Sri Lanka . If result positive , widespread adaptation score significantly contribute improved patient outcome , good utilization ICU service cost effective healthcare provision . The study take place district general hospital ( DGH ) Moneragala , Sri Lanka , low middle income country ( LMIC ) . The hospital nearly 450 bed 800 staff member serve 50000 patient per year approximately 500 cardiac arrest per year . It four medical ward , two surgical ward 5 ward . A wedge shape interventional study design investigate whether `` set test '' early warning system protocol implement rural district general hospital LMIC use local TTT model reduce cardiac arrest admission ICU . Objectives - To describe characteristic , include EWS , patient resuscitate DGH , Moneragala . - To validate suitable EWSs DGH , Moneragala . - To examine effectiveness validate EWS part train implementation bundle reduce incidence cardiac arrest , ICU admission mortality . Methodology Study component 1- Retrospective study All clinical variable patient characteristic past two year ( 01.04.2013-30.06.2015 ) collect retrospectively BHTs cardiac arrest ( approximately 200 ) DGH Moneragala . Vital sign laboratory measurement 24 48 hour cardio respiratory emergency admission hospital extract . The availability variable require calculation various EWSs note . Data collection tool : Pre-defined data sheet . Study process : All clinical variable patient characteristic collect retrospectively BHTs . Vital sign laboratory measurement 24 48 hour cardio respiratory emergency admission hospital extract . The availability variable require calculation various EWSs note . Statistical analysis : Descriptive statistic use describe characteristic resuscitate patient . Mean standard deviation use normally distribute continuous variable median inter quartile range use skewed distribution continuous variable . Count percentage use discrete variable . The availability physiological variable also illustrate use count percentage . Study component 2- The component two study aim select validate EWS capable predict cardiac arrest high sensitivity specificity A prospective cohort design , conduct unit DGH , Moneragala ( except ICU ) consecutive in-patient admission period 3 month . Sample size : This phase use determine ability EWSs predict patient outcome regard cardiac arrest , ICU admission death . Assuming best perform EWS achieve area ROC ( AUROC ) curve .80 alpha 0.05 80 % power , comparison EWS perform `` bad '' ( AUROC curve = 0.80 ) require 28 cardiac arrest patient . With cardiac arrest rate approximately 1 % ( cardiac arrests/total admission ) , 56,000 admission per year . mean EWS perform 2800 patient . Under assumption , comparison EWS AUROC curve = 0.70 require n=108 patient cardiac arrest ; thus , 10,800 patient test EWS . With 56000 admission per year 3 month phase 2 adequate . Data collection tool : Data collect bed head ticket use pre-defined data sheet . Demographic detail physiological data record admission ward . Physiological data collect twice daily medical/nursing officer . National Early Warning Score ( NEWS ) , Modified Early Warning Score ( MEWS ) , Standardized Early Warning Score ( SEWS ) , Patient At Risk Score ( PARS ) , Leeds Early Warning Score ( LEWS ) , The Assessment Score Sick patient Identification Step‐up Treatment ( ASSIST ) , Cardiac Arrest Risk Triage ( CART ) VitalpacTMEarly Warning Score ( ViEWS ) test phase select best perform one , describe . Statistical analysis : Data analyze use STATA 13 . Selection EWS base discrimination ( use area receiver operate characteristic curve ) , calibration ( use Hosmer-Lemeshow Ĉ-statistic ) accuracy ( use Brier score ) . Study component 3- The purpose component examine effectiveness select EWS improve pre-defined patient outcome . This experimental step wedge design . Study set population : Same study two Study period : Twelve month Sample size : Currently , early detection deterioration mean EWS prior cardiac arrest 0 % . The current cardiac arrest team attend patient cardiac arrest detect . It anticipate , EWS identify Part 2 study , early detection cardiac arrest increase 50-75 % . To detect difference 50 % one ward , 90 % power alpha 0.05 , would require sample size 15 cardiac arrest patient . The estimated cardiac arrest rate study site &lt; 1 % . Assuming cardiac arrest rate approximately 1 % , select EWS part EWS perform 1,500 patient . This mean study power detect least 7 12 ward investigator implement EWS 12 month take recruit ward . However addition data collection three month enable ( power ) detect almost ward . Data collection tool study variable Patient data collect bed head ticket use pre-defined data sheet . Interviewer administer questionnaire use assess success training nurse doctor . Successfulness course delivery section measure separately . Data sheet use monitor implementation intervention outcome measure . Study variable include variable study 2 . The indicator monitor implementation intervention also gather . Success implementation evaluate use process outcome measure . These include indicator monitor implementation intervention ( completeness observation , use EWS , appropriate escalation nursing team ) outcome indicator ( patient suffer cardiac arrest , detect missed EWS , ICU admissions in-hospital mortality ) . Data also collect monitor success training programme ( retention knowledge ) . Intervention study process Introduce EWS : An EWS appropriate use study set adapt participant educate . Training staff : The participate Doctors Nurses ward train early detection management clinically deteriorate patient base EWS select . The training implement step wedge method new ward absorb program monthly . As ward EWS introduce , acute care training ( ACT ) course delivered staff . The ACT course comprise preparation use dedicate e-learning platform ( http : //nics-training.com/ ? page_id=403 ) follow 2-day structured , multi-modal training package focus acute care skill ward nurse doctor , comprise short lecture , problem base learn practical skill station The ACT course deliver small group , fortnightly faculty local trainer ( Doctors , nurse tutor nurse officer ) receive five day preparatory train trainer ( TTT ) course lead experienced doctor nurse trainer ( part investigator ' study team ) model previous effort . As phase 2 , process outcome data , collect trained data collector . Follow : Formative summative training assessment conduct training participant measure effectiveness program , train . Coaching , support feedback provide faculty every two month ensure maintenance quality . Any issue face staff implementation identify appropriate remedial action take . The end point proportion patient detect ( miss ) system number unexpected cardiac arrest ICU admission . Comparison outcomes : The `` risk '' population calculate proportion actual cardiac arrest , test whether least 50 % 75 % whereas value 0 % ( systematic detection at-risk patient currently , cardiac arrest team attend declare cardiac arrest . This do ward separately well group whole . Matched group outcomes ICU admission rate , mortality cardiac arrest compare . These assess ward whole group EWS/RRS implementation . Wilcoxon signed-rank test McNemar test use compare non parametric continuous discrete variable match group outcome measure , respectively Pre post training : The impact training knowledge , skill confidence staff management deteriorate patient training assess , ( appendix C , D E ) . Knowledge retention : Knowledge retention measure 3 month 6 month train . Statistical analysis : Prevalence unanticipated ICU admission , cardiac arrest hospital mortality calculate hospital overall , well ward ( use total number admission denominator ) , implementation EWS select component 2 study . The effectiveness EWS system assess comparison proportion cardiac arrest case identify early use EWS . Risk ratios 95 % confidence interval calculate share frailty specify ward account within ward clustering . The formative summative assessment use compare , paired manner , effect training program ward staff . The outcome analysis statistical test use compare outcome implement EWS describe section 3.5 comparison outcomes Ethical clearance obtain Ethics review Committee Faculty Medicine , University Colombo ( EC-15-034 ) .</detailed_description>
