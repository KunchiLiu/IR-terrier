	<detailed_description>Oxygen therapy refers administration oxygen high concentration room air . According recent American Association Respiratory Care Clinical Practice Guidelines , indication supplemental oxygen include hypoxemia , severe trauma , acute myocardial infarction , short term therapy , postoperative recovery . Though contraindication oxygen therapy , potential complication exist , include ventilatory depression hypercarbic patient , absorption atelectasis , oxygen toxicity ( particularly patient receive specific chemotherapeutic agent ) . In spontaneously breathe hypoxemic patient without endotracheal tube , important able deliver high concentration oxygen order either avoid intubation bridge intubation . A number oxygen delivery device available different property make useful different situation . Variable performance ( low-flow ) system : Low-flow device variable performance deliver flow rate less patient 's peak inspiratory flow rate ( PIFR ) oxygen dilute room air entrain around device . Higher PIFR ( e.g . respiratory distress ) result decrease FiO2 deliver variable performance device . Rebreathing carbon dioxide also possible low-flow mask low oxygen flow rate . Variable performance system include nasal cannula , simple mask , partial rebreathing mask , non-rebreathing mask . Nasal cannulas commonly use stable patient comfortable , less irritating skin , less anxiety-inducing mask ; also allow patient eat , talk , use incentive spirometry . Nasal cannula provide 24-40 % FiO2 flow-rates 6 L/min . The simple mask commonly use immediate postoperative setting supplemental oxygen . Several small hole either side mask well imperfect seal allow room air entrain exhale air escape mask . Simple mask provide 35-50 % FiO2 flow-rates 5-10 L/min.1 Long-term use mask lead skin irritation pressure sores.The partial rebreather consist simple mask reservoir bag , provide 40-70 % FiO2 flow-rates 6-10 L/min.1 The partial rebreather longer use many hospital range oxygen delivery encompass simple mask non-rebreather . The non-rebreathing mask similar partial rebreather include one-way valve prevent exhale air return reservoir bag . The non-rebreather deliver 60-80 % FiO2 10-15 L/min.1 Fixed performance ( high-flow ) system : By deliver oxygen flow rate great PIFR , fixed performance system make possible provide specify FiO2 throughout respiratory cycle . The two commonly use device Venturi mask OxyMaskTM . Venturi mask use Bernoulli principle deliver oxygen high flow Venturi valve narrow constriction follow wide area vent entrain room air . Because relative ease use consistent oxygen delivery , useful patient COPD others chronic hypoxemia . The Venturi mask able deliver FiO2 24-50 % .1 Venturi mask test study . The OxyMaskTM relatively new device use Venturi diffuser five-pronged open mask design , allow patient talk may cause less claustrophobia close mask . OxyMaskTM able deliver 25-80 % FiO2 flow rate 1.5-15 L/min . A closed mask perfect seal could theoretically deliver 100 % FiO2 . For purpose study , Jackson Rees circuit use deliver oxygen anesthesia mask . The Jackson Rees circuit ( also call Mapleson F circuit ) routinely use transport deliver oxygen oxygen tank intubate patient . This circuit consist tube connect manual ventilation bag squeeze deliver pressurize gas flow patient . The bag equip adjustable pressure limit valve , allow provider control pressure deliver squeeze bag . Measurement FiO2 : It establish FiO2 achieve nasal cannula differ significantly whether subject breathes mouth nose . This property establish mask . With closed mask , FiO2 achieve would also regardless mouth nose-breathing . With open mask , assumption must make oxygen concentration equal nose mouth order ensure equivalence mouth nose-breathing . Also , previous study oxygen delivery system use variety method measure FiO2 . From review literature oxygen delivery device discuss , nasal cannula study measurement oxygen level pharynx , whereas mask study measurement oxygen lip . Study Rationale : The study OxyMaskTM determine FiO2 base gas sample lip . However , due possibility gas mix and/or nasal breathe open mask design , unclear gas sample lip gas arrive trachea , clinically relevant location . The gas inspire trachea actually see alveoli participates oxygenation blood . Gas mix would seem likely open mask design OxyMask . A study compare pharyngeal FiO2 mask would accurately demonstrate effective FiO2 currently available data . This turn , good inform perioperative clinician best approach maximize oxygen delivery critically ill post-operative patient require supplemental oxygen treat prevent systemic hypoxia . Study Design : The investigator measure steady state FiO2 pharynx lips simultaneously subject undergo follow oxygen delivery condition sequentially : 1 ) room air ; 2 ) high flow oxygen simple mask ; 3 ) high flow oxygen non-rebreather mask ; 4 ) high flow oxygen OxyMask ; 5 ) high flow oxygen anesthesia mask head-strap Jackson Rees circuit . Study Population : The study include 20 subject . A mean difference 10 % pharyngeal FiO2 mask consider clinically important . The expected standard deviation within-subject FiO2 3.5 % . With significance criterion 0.05 , 10 subject would provide 90 % power detect mean difference 10 % . Setting : The study take place fully equip operating room anesthesia machine approve patient use Infection Control Biomedical Engineering . It locate South OR area Kohler Pavilion OHSU equip Datex Ohmeda anesthesia machine Poet Gas Analyzer use study . The study conduct hour avoid conflict surgical patient care . The oxygen sensor calibrate subject test . Recruitment : Subjects recruit OHSU 's perioperative service . Advertisement flyer distribute operating room location . Consent : The consent process undertaken individual appropriate human subject protection HIPPA education , perform person OHSU campus phone . Subjects may withdraw study time . Procedures : The subject participate one study day require one hour per subject . Subjects remain NPO least 6 hour prior study period . Subject characteristic record . The anesthesia machine turn oxygen sensor gas analyzer calibrate . Baseline vital sign ( HR , BP , SpO2 ) measure . FEV1 FVC measure anesthesia machine standard circuit , use Y-piece mouthpiece . The follow protocol gas sample use : One gas sample line attach one end gas analyzer end 8 French suction catheter , lubricate 2 % lidocaine jelly . This nasal catheter insert nare , tip position immediately behind uvula . Placement confirm visualize tip catheter use penlight subject open mouth widely say , `` Ah . '' If require , tongue depressor use . If catheter visualize , inserted standard depth 9-10cm . The nasal catheter tap subject 's face . A second gas sample line tap subject 's face position sample occurs patient 's lip . After placement two sample catheter confirm , subject breathe room air normally 90 second FiO2 measure period 30 second . The subject instruct whether use nose mouth breathe , since patient hospital typically instructed way breathe . Afterward , test various oxygen mask perform oxygen set high flow ( 15L/min ) simple mask , non-rebreather mask , OxyMask , anesthesia mask headstrap Jackson Rees circuit . Since auxiliary oxygen dial anesthesia machine go 10L/min , 15L/min adjustable oxygen valve attach directly main oxygen supply line operate room . After placement mask start oxygen high flow , subject breathe normally 90 second FiO2 measure next 30 second , similarly room air control . At end trial period , subject ask take single vital capacity breath ( start maximum exhalation follow maximum inhalation ) . Between test mask , five minute period breathing room air washout period confirm stability hemodynamic status ( measurement BP HR ) . Demographic data obtain include height ( cm ) , weight ( kg ) , age , gender , self-declared ethnicity . Blood pressure , heart rate , oxygen saturation record baseline prior follow mask-trial . Baseline FEV1/FVC measurement conduct patient prior initiate study record . FiO2 data download digitally gas analyzer excel spreadsheet . If possible , oxygen percentage manually record breath determine range oxygen percentage ( minimal maximal ) phase ventilation , 30 second measurement period . Respiratory rate measurement time also record . At end 30 second sample period , final measurement take forced vital capacity breath . Data Analysis : Phase ventilation define use capnography tracing , display concurrently measurement inspire oxygen . Maximal minimal oxygen concentration average inspiration , 30 second mask breathe trial , subject . These value average across group intervention define statistic entire group . Values record normal tidal volume ventilation analyze separately value record force vital capacity ventilation . The Analysis Variance test appropriate post-hoc analysis use determine difference FiO2 administer mask test .</detailed_description>
