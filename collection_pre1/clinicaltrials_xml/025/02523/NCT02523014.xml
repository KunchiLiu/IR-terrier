	<brief_title>A Study Looking Targeted Therapy According Tumor Markers People With Meningiomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Each arm prospective , one-stage phase 2 study evaluate efficacy smoothen receptor SMO FAK inhibitor patient SMO-mutated neurofibromin 2 ( NF2 ) -mutated meningioma , respectively . There separate phase 2 arm two tumor mutation group tumor grade cohort . Patients recurrent progressive Grade I-III meningioma eligible trial . Samples undergo central pathology review . Patient 's tumor sample test presence SMO NF2 mutation . Patients harbor SMO NF2 mutation meet eligibility criterion enrol . Within arm , two different patient cohort base histology : grade I versus II/III meningioma . The primary secondary objective describe . Primary objective : 1 . To determine activity SMO inhibitor patient meningiomas harbor SMO mutation measure 6-month progression free survival ( PFS ) response rate . 2 . To determine activity FAK inhibitor patient meningiomas harbor NF2 mutation measure 6-month PFS response rate . Secondary objective : 1 . To determine overall survival progression-free survival SMO FAK inhibitor patient meningioma . 2 . To determine adverse event rate SMO FAK inhibitor patient meningioma . NOTE : Afuresertib , agent identify patient AKT1 mutation currently available . Testing AKT1 mutation commence afuresertib become available site notify via protocol amendment . Tumor sample test SMO NF2 mutation notice . Patients follow 2 year completion treatment .</detailed_description>
