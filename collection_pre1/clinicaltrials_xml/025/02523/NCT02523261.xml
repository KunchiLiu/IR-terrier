	<brief_summary>Mechanical thrombectomy ( TM ) validate 4 randomize control trial high scientific level reference treatment cerebral infarction associate proximal cerebral occlusion ( MR CLEAN , ESCAPE 2014 , 2015 ) . These study show first time major decrease ( -35 % ) disability relate severe cerebral infarction reduction mortality . These study use thrombectomy device call stent retriever obtain recanalization rate range 58-72 % 2 large study ( MR CLEAN , ESCAPE 2014 , 2015 ) . This criterion `` recanalization '' important largely determines functional prognosis patient severe cerebral infarction ( Khatri , 2014 ) . These result excite even well . Indeed , already new thrombectomy device available special interest ADAPT ( A Direct Aspiration First Pass Technic ) . This distal suction system , high level endovascular navigability , provide high recanalization rate ( &gt; 90 % ) , low morbidity , synergistic effect stent retriever ( Turk A , Kowoll 2014 2015 ) . To date , technic ( ADAPT ) never assess randomize control trial . We previously conduct comparative observational study two recanalization strategy thrombectomy use first-line ADAPT widely use stent retriever . The interventional neuroradiologist could , case recanalization failure Solitaire system , use another thrombectomy material leave operator 's choice . 244 consecutive patient two center ( Rothschild Foundation , Foch Hospital , France ) admit cerebral infarction associate proximal occlusion include . This far large series patient ADAPT system . The complete recanalization rate 84 % ADAPT versus 68 % stent retriever ( P = 0.006 ) . Unpublished data , Oral presentation European Stroke Organization , April 2015 ) . Our research aim show first line strategy recanalization thrombectomy use distal suction system ( ADAPT ) superior use stent retriever .</brief_summary>
