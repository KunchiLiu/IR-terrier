	<detailed_description>Potentially inappropriate prescribing ( PIP ) frequent , particularly Long-Term Care ( LTC ) patient . Tools STOPP/START Beers criterion develop identify PIP clinical setting . Due lack clinical data database , subset criterion applicable routinely collect health administrative data ( HAD ) . This subset show identify PIP HAD frequency comparable clinical study use full STOPP-START criterion . Nonetheless , performance subset STOPP/START Beers criterion HAD compare clinical data patient unknown ; furthermore , performance updated 2014 STOPP-START 2012 Beers criterion compare one another also unknown . The overall aim study validate medication appropriateness criterion applicable HAD comparing performance apply clinical data . The present study two main three secondary objective ( see Figure 1 detail ) : A . Main objective : Objective 1 : To validate subset STOPP/START Beers criterion define applicability HAD , compare performance detect PIP apply HAD full set criterion apply clinical data resident ( clinical data provide `` gold standard '' ) . Objective 2 : To compare detection rate full STOPP/START full Beers criterion one another applied clinical data . B . Secondary objective : Objective 3 : To assess number proportion unidentified PIP use subset STOPP/START Beers criterion HAD compare full set criterion , apply clinical data . Objective 4 : To compare performance subset STOPP/START Beers criterion apply HAD detect PIP compare clinical data resident . Objective 5 : To compare performance subset STOPP/START Beers criterion applicable HAD one another apply HAD . To achieve objective , investigator conduct cross-sectional study link HAD clinical data . Eligible patient 66 year recently admit one six LTC facility Ottawa , Ontario , begin June 1st , 2014 . The target sample size 275 , recruitment may stop interim analysis demonstrate statistical significance achieve few patient . Medication , diagnostic clinical data collect admission pharmacist otherwise involved patient 's care . The main outcome measure proportion PIP miss subset STOPP/START criterion apply HAD compare clinical data ( gold standard ) .</detailed_description>
