	<brief_title>Effect Statin Treatment Urinary AQP2 ( uAQP2/01 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Statins first-line recommended pharmacological therapy patient dyslipidemias play key role primary secondary prevention coronary heart disease . By decrease plasma total low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) concentration , statins decrease risk atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease associate morbidity mortality . Statins occupy part active binding site 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A ( HMG-CoA ) inhibit enzymatic activity liver , key step lead reduction cellular sterol pool . Statins also beneficial effect vascular wall stabilizing atherosclerotic plaque , ameliorate impaired endothelial function , reduce vascular inflammation . Besides well-known metabolic cardiovascular effect , recently show statin increase plasma membrane expression renal water channel Aquaporin 2 ( AQP2 ) . Water reabsorption kidney connect tubule collect duct regulate antidiuretic hormone arginine vasopressin ( AVP ) , promote plasma membrane expression water channe aquaporin 2 ( AQP2 ) , rate-limiting step control reabsorption water , thus urine concentration , segment nephron . The investigator report number evidence show statin accumulate AQP2 apical membrane collect duct cell AVP-independent mechanism . The effect statins AQP2 independent classical cholesterol homeostasis rather depend depletion mevalonate-derived intermediate cholesterol synthetic pathway , i.e . isoprenoid intermediate , include farnesylpyrophosphate ( FPP ) geranylgeranylpyrophosphate ( GGPP ) . Water balance disorder often associate defect AQP2 trafficking . Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus ( NDI ) characterize inability kidney respond AVP stimulation cause either mutation AQP2 vasopressin type-2 receptor ( AVPR2 ) gene . Mutations AVPR2 gene lead X-linked NDI ( X-NDI ) . This cause 90 % diagnosed congenital NDI case . Conventional treatment X-NDI patient consist low-sodium , low-protein diet administration thiazide diuretic sometimes combination indomethacin amiloride . Although drug cause relief X-NDI symptom , often eliminate . Due partial beneficial effect conventional treatment , much effort spend past year uncover new alternative method induce antidiuresis X-NDI patient . In regard , investigator recently report statin , particular fluvastatin , accumulate AQP2 apical membrane collect duct cell AVP-independent mechanism increase water reabsorption wild type X-NDI mouse . The effect statins AQP2 traffic human , however , deserve investigation , also consider potential efficacy statins patient X-NDI . This reason embark present study investigator monitor time-dependent effect statin therapy urine excretion AQP2 , diuresis urine osmolality cohort hypercholesterolemic subject initiate simvastatin therapy three month . Two group patient serve control : patient already statin treatment patient choose undergo initial program standard hypolipidemic `` mediterranean '' style diet .</detailed_description>
