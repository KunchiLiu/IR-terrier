	<detailed_description>Hypersensitivity pneumonitis ( HP ) syndrome variable clinical presentation , inflammation lung parenchyma cause inhalation organic antigen specific low molecular weight substance previously sensitize individual . Systemic symptom may present . Chronic HP represent final stage disease , prolonged exposure particular antigen would lead lung fibrosis . The list new antigen grow , main antigen responsible disease exposure mold bird . Not exposed individual develop HP . The pathophysiology involve initial exposure subsequent decrease antigen tolerance . Genetic susceptibility also modulate immune response specific antigen . There reliable epidemiological data incidence prevalence HP . Differences type antigen sensitization , lack standardize diagnostic criterion underreporting possible factor . In Mexico , one population survey show estimate incidence 30 case per 100000 inhabitant 2 year ( 1988-1990 ) ; however , bias limit extrapolation data context . The patient rarely associate onset symptom relevant exposure , make important actively search environmental factor respiratory complaint . It believe intermittent exposure antigen , long-term exposure small load antigen cumulative effect multiple episode acute exposure cause chronic HP . It noteworthy small proportion patient single episode acute exposure develop chronic HP . In chronic HP , patient complains dyspnea exertion dry cough . Systemic symptom fever weight loss rarely report may associate episode acute exposure . Physical examination reveals crackle less commonly , digital clubbing . Auscultation may reveal presence squawk arise abrupt open small airway . Hypoxemia find patient severe lung disease . The differential diagnosis fibrosing interstitial disease challenge , due overlap clinical history , functional tomographic finding terminal stage pathology . There gold standard test diagnosis HP form : diagnosis result combination epidemiological , clinical , radiological data exam . High resolution computer tomography ( HRCT ) fundamental role differential diagnosis . However , advanced stage , tomographic scan demonstrate pattern indistinguishable nonspecific interstitial pneumonia ( NSIP ) usual interstitial pneumonia ( UIP ) , presence architectural distortion , traction bronchiectasis bronchiolectasis , minimum ground glass opacity honeycomb . The interpretation HRCT allow `` clue '' differential diagnosis idiopathic intersticial pneumonia ( IIPs ) . In comparative HRCT study , finding show small airway involvement , lobular area decrease attenuation vascularity , air trap ground glass centrilobular micronodules Surgical biopsy may aid differential diagnosis HP chronic idiopathic interstitial pneumonitis , especially exposure unclear . Even advanced fibrosis , accentuation inflammation around small airway major find . Pulmonary function test ( PFTs ) commonly show restrictive ventilatory defect decrease DLCO . There may concomitant obstructive ventilatory defect , secondary involvement small airway . However , PFTs relatively insensitive detect small airway involvement concomitant interstitial fibrosis . Firstly , conventional PFTs may normal patient involvement small airway since contribute le 30 % total airway resistance . Furthermore , damage small airway HP generally focal occur parallel fibrosed area - even small airway involve , region may completely disregard since exclude ventilation , PFTs globally feature standard restrictive pattern . In summary , traditional PFTs sensitive enough detect diffuse small airway involvement disease , matter severe , neither detect focal change . In case , investigator hypothesize test , force oscillometry technique ( FOT ) , experience widely recognize context evaluation obstructive disease like asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) technique negative expiratory pressure ( NEP ) could use purpose . For , image test , especially high-resolution tomography expiratory scan , seem sensitive detect small airway involvement . Removal causal exposure treatment choice . The use corticosteroid reduces duration acute phase , affect long-term prognosis . Inhaled corticosteroid bronchodilator may use evidence airflow limitation , evidence basing use . 2 . Study hypothesis The investigator ' hypothesis proportion patient diagnose chronic HP exhibit expiratory flow limitation , due airway obstruction cause mostly bronchiolar involvement characteristic pathology . This involvement could quantify functional test , FOT , image technique high resolution CT scan chest expiratory scan . This may one mechanism justifies lower exercise capacity great degree dyspnea exertion individual , together factor secondary interstitial lung fibrosis , even patient normal FEV1 ( forced expiratory volume 1 second ) /FVC ( forced vital capacity ) , FEV1 , residual volume ( RV ) resistance .</detailed_description>
