	<brief_summary>Routine screen mammography increase non-palpable suspicious lesion detection rate , require histopathological evaluation . The discovery atypical lesion breast biopsy associate two interrelated risk : 1 . The risk underestimate severity lesion biopsied currently lead systematically achieve surgical resection patient breast cancer ( BC ) finally identify surgery 10 25 % case . Thus , unnecessary surgery perform 75 90 % case ( cancer ) . 2 . These breast lesion confer long-term increase subsequent risk breast cancer ( cumulative incidence 15 25 % 25 year ) . Thus , woman identify atypical lesion follow use clinical mammographic annual evaluation . The goal would get model ass risk longer operate patient high risk BC . Several group attempt identify predictor concurrent secondary BC associate discovery unusual lesion biopsy . However , often focus subtype atypia ( eg atypical metaplasia , atypical ductal hyperplasia , atypical lobular hyperplasia ) prediction model validate prospective multicenter . Based large retrospective study Gustave Roussy , prediction model ( Nomat ) develop , common atypical lesion , predict presence BC excision surgery ( risk concurrent BC ) . This model base age patient , disappearance radiographic abnormality ( microcalcifications general ) biopsy initial radiological lesion size . This model good performance area curve ( AUC ) 0.72 . In previous series , BC high-risk threshold 20 % , negative predictive value 90 % , model would prevent surgery 51 % patient ( low risk patient model ) . It essential validate model forward-looking different center ensure relevance . This multicenter prospective validation model 300 patient operated atypical lesion 20 center . All patient atypical breast lesion routine surgery . The clinical data , image histological data collect prospectively . The main objective study validate model Nomat .</brief_summary>
