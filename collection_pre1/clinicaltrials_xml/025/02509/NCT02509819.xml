	<brief_summary>The Intrepid Dynamic Exoskeletal Orthosis ( IDEO ) type ankle foot orthosis design reduce pain improve function individual foot/ankle pain and/or weakness . Because IDEO restrict ankle movement , geometry mechanic device must design allow smooth roll-over patient walk IDEO . The heel wedge , physically part IDEO , integral part IDEO-heel wedge-shoe `` system '' . The goal research determine heel wedge property may contribute smoothness roll-over gait . Insight effect heel wedge property roll-over help optimize design IDEO-heel wedge-shoe `` system '' may produce guideline customization feature .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Influence Heel Wedge Properties Roll-over Intrepid Dynamic Exoskeletal Orthosis ( IDEO )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The propose study include group comparison ( Aim 1 ) fully repeat crossover design ( Aim 2 ) . It conduct Military Performance Lab ( MPL ) Center Intrepid ( CFI ) , Brooke Army Medical Center , Joint Base San Antonio ( JBSA ) Fort Sam Houston , Texas . Subjects use IDEOs come Military Performance Lab one test session walk standardize shoe six different heel wedge random order . Control data also collect able-bodied individual . Control subject also come MPL one test session walk use standardize shoe . For subject , biomechanical gait data collect subject walk along walkway MPL . This data use calculate roll-over shape , instantaneous radius curvature , Center Pressure ( COP ) velocity , ankle moment .</detailed_description>
