	<detailed_description>Muscle stretch common practice apply warm-up process enhance performance sport prevent decrease risk sport injury . Muscle stretch also use therapeutic purpose many clinical condition . It generally perform either static dynamic manner . The effect stretch depend type , duration timing stretch . However , acute chronic effect stretch different muscle . Recent study suggest static stretch adverse effect performance , reduce maximal muscle force successful prevent non-contact injury , believe . Dynamic type report improve flexibility range motion well . But still debate prescription provide best result term flexibility , power , performance injury protection . And answer question happen viscoelastic property muscle stretch dynamically period time clearly establish . This study plan investigate effect 5-week dynamic stretch exercise training muscle tendon unit gastrocnemius muscle . The effect train program assess ultrasound .</detailed_description>
