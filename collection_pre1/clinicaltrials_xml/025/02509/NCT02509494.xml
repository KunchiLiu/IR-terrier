	<brief_title>Staged Phase 3 Study Assess Safety Immunogenicity Ebola Candidate Vaccines Ad26.ZEBOV MVA-BN-Filo During Implementation Stages 1 2</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This stag Phase 3 study gather information safety immunogenicity heterologous prime-boost regimen . In regimen , Ad26.ZEBOV administer prime vaccination later boost candidate vaccine MVA-BN-Filo . The study take place Sierra Leone consist screen phase , active phase ( vaccination ) follow-up phase . The active phase study conduct initially two stage . In first stage approximately 40 adult age 18 year older vaccinate gain information safety immunogenicity prime-boost regimen . In stage 2 large group approximately 688 individual vaccinate evaluate safety immunogenicity prime-boost regimen across different age group . In stage , child age 1 year older , adolescent adult include . Solicited local systemic adverse event collect 7 day prime boost vaccination . Unsolicited adverse event collect sign informed consent form ( ICF ) onwards 56 day boost vaccination Stage 1 28 day prime vaccination Stage 2 , 28 day boost vaccination . Serious adverse event collect sign ICF onwards 12 36 month prime vaccination Stage 2 Stage 1 , respectively . These data review independent data monitoring committee ( IDMC ) ass whether initiation vaccination next stage age group provide . Safety evaluation include assessment adverse event , monitor throughout study . Participants Stage 2 follow safety immunogenicity 12 month prime vaccination . Participants Stage 1 follow safety immunogenicity 36 month prime vaccination .</detailed_description>
