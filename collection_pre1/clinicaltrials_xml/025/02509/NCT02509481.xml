	<brief_title>Repeat Ivermectin Mass Drug Administrations Control Malaria : Pilot Safety Efficacy Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective : To determine efficacy repeat ivermectin mass drug administration ( IVM MDA ) ( 150 µg/kg ) , give population eligible patient enrol village , reduce cumulative incidence uncomplicated malaria episode enrol village child ( ≤ 5 year age ) course treatment . Hypothesis : Repeated IVM MDA start begin rainy season well tolerate safe , reduce clinical malaria episodes child significantly reduce malaria transmission among treated village . Overview Study Design : Single-blind ( outcome assessor ) ; parallel assignment 2 arm ; cluster-randomized control trial determine effect repeat IVM MDA malaria transmission clinical malaria episode . The unit randomization village ( cluster ) . 8 village total enrol two arm . The active comparator arm ( 4 village ) receive single standard MDA ( IVM ; 150-200 µg/kg + albendazole ; 400 mg ) soon start rainy season , experimental arm ( 4 village ) receive standard MDA date , plus 5 IVM MDA 3 week interval thereafter . The primary endpoint cumulative incidence clinical malaria episodes child ≤5 year age within village . Sites : This study conduct village along main east-west north-south road corridor Sud-Ouest administrative region Burkina Faso . Study Population : Indigenous Burkinabé various ethnic group ( Dagara , Bobo , Lobi , Mossi , etc. ) . The entire eligible population enrol village receive MDAs , follow standard inclusion/exclusion criterion MDA control microfilaremia cause Wuchereria bancrofti ( lymphatic filariasis ; LF ) . Clinical incidence malaria assess child live enrol village ≤ 5 year age , receive treatment due standard MDA exclusion criterion child &lt; 90 cm . Study Interventions : 2 arm : 1 ) Active comparator arm - single standard MDA IVM ( 150 µg/kg ) + albendazole ( ALB ; 400 mg ) soon begin rainy season ; 2 ) Experimental arm , single standard MDA IVM ( 150 µg/kg ) + ALB ( 400 mg ) plus 5 MDA IVM alone ( 150 µg/kg ) 3 week interval thereafter . Community health worker train local health authority Sud-Ouest region perform first MDA arm logistical assistance study investigator . Repeated MDAs occur experimental-arm village , perform study investigator . Follow-up Procedures : Trained nurse visit study village week course study investigate record adverse event severe adverse event communicate study population . They also perform active case surveillance week enrol village child clinical malaria episode , define ≥38.0°C fever history fever last 24 hour + positive rapid diagnostic test Plasmodium falciparum . Secondary measure collect nurse . Sample Size : Assuming 80 % cumulative incidence malaria episode control arm intracluster correlation coefficient 0.02 , 4 cluster need per arm 69 child enrol per cluster detect conservative 40 % reduction incidence treatment arm 80 % power statistical confidence 95 % . Safety Outcomes : • Adverse event ( seriousness , causality , expectedness ) Secondary Outcomes : - Incidence new P. falciparum infection acquire ( molecular force-of-infection ) - Prevalence intensity ( eggs/larvae per gram feces ) soil transmit helminth infection subset treated patient 6-10 year age . - Indoor-resting Anopheles mosquito capture rate - Outdoor-host seek Anopheles mosquito capture rate - Adult mosquito age structure ( parity rate ) capture mosquito - Plasmodium sporozoite rate/entomological inoculation rate capture mosquito - Rate Wuchereria bancrofti capture mosquito</detailed_description>
