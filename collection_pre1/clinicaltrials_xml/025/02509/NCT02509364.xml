	<brief_summary>Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( IPF ) highly heterogeneous lethal pathological process limit therapeutic option , common severe idiopathic interstitial pneumonia ( IIPs ) . During past 20 year , incidence IPF increase significantly . Most IPF patient show median survival time 2-3 year diagnosis . Five-year survival rate 30 % -50 % . It 's difficult diagnose early stage IPF . Once patient go hospital , 's already late stage . Now effective therapy except lung transplant IPF clinical application . Acute exacerbation idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( AE-IPF ) fatal condition high mortality ( 80 % ) . Its etiology pathogenesis remain unknown . There lack effective treatment . Based investigator ' long-term clinical observation , case AE-IPF initially get `` common cold '' coryza , cough , nasal obstructionï¼Œrhinorrhea , sore throat , patient fever , headache , etc . Some patient ' condition develop rapidly become severe similar situation acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) . Why AE-IPF patient hypersensitive `` cold '' ? What immunologic pathological mechanism lung lesion patient expose `` common cold '' ? How effectively offer interventional treatment AE-IPF ? All question yet explain clearly . In investigator ' previous retrospective study , investigator find obviously imbalanced immune response IPF patient , include increase cluster differentiation 4 ( CD4 ) T cell population , immunoglobulin complement . The investigator also find highly express inflammatory cytokine ( IL-17 , MIG IL-9 ) high detection rate pathogens AE-IPF patient , especially serum immunoglobulin M ( IgM ) antibody respiratory virus . These finding provide strong suggestion imbalance immunologic function IPF relationship AE-IPF infection , especially `` Cold '' virus infection might key trigger AE-IPF .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>IPF become focus study area pulmonary fibrosis , account 25 % interstitial lung disease ( ILD ) 1 60 % idiopathic interstitial pneumonia ( IIP ) . The past 20 year observe remarkable tendency increase IPF incidence , accompany 2-3 year medium survival diagnosis 30-50 % 5-year survival2 . Due limit diagnosis method early stage disease , patient likely diagnosed reach middle late stage . Other issue lack effective treatment , except lung transplantation . Most death cause acute exacerbation , define clinician acute exacerbation IPF ( AE-IPF ) characterize rapid deterioration relatively stable period IPF ( Stable-IPF ) . Exacerbation may occur stage IPF development ( see figure ) accompany hazardous quick development , high mortality poor prognosis . The incidence mortality AE-IPF varies different study . Kubo etc . report acute exacerbation occur within 3 year around 57 % IPF patient , mortality 53 % . Study Kim etc . show mortality AE-IPF reach 78 % . Study Song etc.demonstrated incidence acute exacerbation IPF 35.4 % , 50 % in-hospital morality , 56 % 1-year mortality 18.4 % 3-year mortality . Other study show 1-year post-exacerbation mortality nearly 100 % . Data base 178 in-hospital IPF patient investigator ' department late 4 year show 58 % ( 102/178 ) patient experience acute exacerbation certain stage disease , 70 death occur . Among death , 56 case ( 83 % ) cause acute exacerbation . It clear high incidence mortality AE-IPF essential factor impact survival quality life IPF patient , therefore lead poor prognosis IPF . Hypothesis key scientific question Based analysis , investigator propose follow hypothesis : certain level immunological imbalance exists relatively stable IPF patient , make susceptible infection various pathogen . Once infected , especially virus ( e.g . common cold related virus ) , AE-IPF quickly trigger , lead ARDS-like reaction . To validate hypothesis , four key scientific question need answered study scrupulous design : 1 ) characteristic change immunological function IPF/AE-IPF patient make patient susceptible common cold virus ? 2 ) What kind pathogen , especially common cold virus , key trigger factor development AE-IPF ? 3 ) What kind inflammatory cascade reaction occur AE-IPF lead ARDS-like prompt development pulmonary inflammation ? Key research direction scientific rationale In order address key scientific question , investigator conduct comprehensive study base detailed screen analysis large amount clinical case , integrate research method area immunology , molecular , cytology animal model , well high throughput data collection big data analysis : 1 ) Extensive screen identification pathogen closely related AE-IPF ; 2 ) Comprehensive analysis change immunology function , focus pathological-physiological alteration virus induce immunologic imbalance IPF , well characteristic change relevant cytological signal transduction , identify important AE-IPF bio-markers explain pathological molecular mechanism network ARDS-like inflammatory cascade reaction , significant effort term prevention AE-IPF , reduction mortality , improvement quality life , delay disease progression increase survival . Similar clinical deterioration like AE-IPF also occur almost type pulmonary fibrosis , especially connective tissue disease-ILD ( CTD-ILD ) , nonspecific interstitial pneumonia ( NSIP ) , drug induce ILD , fibrotic allergic pneumonia cryptogenic organize pneumonia ( COP ) etc . Therefore , program also provide insight basic research clinical management acute exacerbation interstitial lung disease , one common problem extensively exist area interstitial lung disease key factor term improve patient ' quality life survival .</detailed_description>
