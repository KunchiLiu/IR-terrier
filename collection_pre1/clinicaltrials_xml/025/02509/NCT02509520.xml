	<brief_summary>Elderly patient experience prolong ICU stay high risk develop post intensive care unit syndrome ( PICS ) , serious medical condition manifest loss muscle mass , weakness , malnutrition neurocognitive decline . PICS often lead chronic disability , prolong mechanical ventilation need costly extend stay long term care facility ( LTCs ) . The investigator ' preliminary study show attempt rehabilitate patient already developed PICS minimally effective , result modest improvement functionality . This project determine effect mobility-based physical rehabilitation ( MPR ) combine neuromuscular electric stimulation ( NMES ) high protein supplementation ( HPRO ) early patient ICU stay prevent PICS related musculoskeletal functional deficit , improve clinical outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Older , critically ill patient survive ICU stay frequently develop post-ICU syndrome ( PICS ) - condition manifest sarcopenia , weakness , malnutrition neurocognitive decline - occur result critical illness , prolong bed rest , catabolism , polypharmacy . PICS frequently lead chronic disability , prolong mechanical ventilation ( MV ) , functional deficit , need extend rehabilitation long term care facility ( LTCs ) . As majority patient admit ICUs ≥ 65 year old , many patient high risk PICS . Since care ICU patient primarily focus medical management acute critical illness , limited resource strategy available prevent PICS . Evidence suggest mobility-based physical rehabilitation ( MPR ) combine resistive training neuromuscular electric stimulation ( NMES ) high protein diet ( HPRO ) contain essential amino acid mitigate loss muscle mass function bed rest elderly . The investigator hypothesize preventive therapy involve addition NMES HPRO MPR early throughout ICU hospital stay mitigate PICS-associated sarcopenia , malnutrition , immobility confer valuable health benefit toward recovery . To test , investigator use 2x2 factorial design older , MV ICU patient receive comprehensive ICU care MPR , randomize one 4 group : 1 ) MPR+NMES , 2 ) MPR+HPRO , 3 ) 3 together , 4 ) MPR alone ( control ) , determine independent combine effect intervention . The Specific Aims 1 ) determine effect add NMES HPRO intervention MPR muscle mass , strength , mobility function old , critically ill MV patient still ICU , 2 ) determine effect add NMES HPRO intervention MPR clinical outcome time wean MV , ICU/hospital length stay discharge disposition patient . This proposal capitalize interdisciplinary collaboration among Pulmonary/Critical Care Intensivists , Physical Therapists , Geriatricians , Clinical Nutritionists , Statisticians Nutrition Metabolism clinical researcher examine efficacy propose comprehensive rehabilitation approach . The investigator ' primary goal attenuate severity sarcopenia functional decline older , critically ill population risk severe disability . Additionally , focus maintain skeletal muscle mass , function , strength , investigator hope improve clinical outcome . The investigator posit combine therapy mitigate PICS-associated disability speed recovery critical illness older , MV ICU patient . This project high overall impact intervention easily administer hospital staff may greatly reduce physiological functional decline hasten recovery acute ICU hospitalization older adult .</detailed_description>
