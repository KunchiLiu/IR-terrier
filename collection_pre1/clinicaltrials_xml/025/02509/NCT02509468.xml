	<detailed_description>Vascular anomaly include heterogeneous group disorder newborns child . While infantile hemangioma common ( 10 % infant ) , generally complicate easily manage , majority vascular anomaly rare ( &lt; 2 % altogether ) guideline management . The recent classification , adopt International Society Study Vascular Anomalies ( ISSVA ) 1996 , divide lesion two broad category : vascular tumor vascular malformation . Vascular malformation ( VMs ) subdivide high-flow VM slow-flow VM . Slow-flow VMs consist congenital anomaly may involve abnormal capillary vessel , venous vessel , lymphatic vessel combination several . They superficial ( involve cutaneous subcutaneous tissue ) and/or may visceral involvement . They limit diffuse , sometimes component genetic hypertrophic syndrome . They always result defective embryologic vasculogenesis . The diagnosis slow-flow VMs perform physical examination - biopsy may require confirmation - , complete imaging , include ultrasonography magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . Slow-flow VMs may simple manage complicate several reason : may particularly voluminous ; associate underlying hypertrophy responsible functional impairment ; painful ; associate seepage continuous cutaneous bleeding ; complicate visceral sign hematologic disturbance ( anemia , thrombopenia ) . Management require dedicate multispecialty care . There guideline treatment , management may include intervention - natural history VMs progressive worsen - , compression physical bandage , sclerotherapy , resection ( feasible ) , anti-inflammatory anti-coagulation drug . The vast majority literature report medical therapy consist paediatric case report , complicate publication bias , inconsistent use nomenclature absence clinical trial . Case report series provide evidence support need clinical trial sirolimus report successful treatment several child complicate vascular anomaly . The choice sirolimus rational . Mammalian target rapamycin ( mTOR ) serine/threonine kinase regulate phosphoinositide-3-kinase involve cell mobility , cell growth angiogenesis . Sirolimus inhibit mTOR , induces inhibition angiogenesis , particular lymphangiogenesis , demonstrate several model . Randomized observational-phase design ( Feldman et al . J Clin Epidemiol 2001 ; 54:550-557 ) : - patient follow 12-month-period - patient start observational period end treat sirolimus - random date ( month 4 month 8 ) , patient switch observational period sirolimus period Therefore , patient his/her control , cross-over trial ( difference cross-over one direction , observational period treatment period ) . This explain variation volume standardize period duration . As specified Feldman et al , randomize placebo-phase design well adapted situation `` placebo control study would perceive unacceptable enrol physician patient '' `` may especially useful highly potent therapy rare disease ''</detailed_description>
