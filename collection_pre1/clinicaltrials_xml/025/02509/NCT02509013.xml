	<brief_title>Prevalence Chronic Kidney Disease Its Association With Clinical Outcome Patients With Coronary Heart Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary aim study evaluate prevalence chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) patient stable coronary heart disease . The secondary aim include : 1 . To evaluate awareness CKD patient stable coronary heart disease . 2 . To find risk factor associate CKD patient . 3 . To evaluate association CKD cardiovascular event one-year 's follow-up . Based sample size estimation , plan recruit 10000 patient 100 center . Patients participate study finish one-year 's follow ( 0 day , 6 month 12 month recruitment ) . During baseline visit , patient ' demographic character collect , laboratory test perform urinalysis , renal function , hepatic function , etc . During 6 month ' follow , MACE ( Major adverse cardiovascular event ) record phone face face interview investigator patient . MACE include all-cause mortality , cardiovascular mortality , non-fatal myocardial infarction , document re-hospitalization unstable angina pectoris , coronary revascularization ( include percutaneous coronary intervention CABG ) . During 12 month 's follow , MACE record , laboratory test perform .</detailed_description>
