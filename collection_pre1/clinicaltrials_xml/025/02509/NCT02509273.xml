	<brief_summary>Closed1 aim compare efficacy , safety pharmacokinetics clonidine ( hydrochloride ) midazolam sedation ventilate child adolescent ( 0-18 year ) admit paediatric intensive care unit ( PICU ) require mechanical ventilation sedation least 24 hour . In particular , proportion subject sedation failure maximum possible dose ( define within study protocol ) measure . Additionally , safety tolerability ( include withdrawal effect ) clonidine compare midazolam evaluate . A pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship clonidine sedation PICU establish . Genetic polymorphisms clinical relevance affect pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamics metabolism also identify . Ad hoc paediatric parenteral formulation clonidine hydrochloride midazolam manufacture . At least 300 subject enrol study centre five European member country ( Czech Republic , Germany , Italy , Netherlands , Sweden ) . The clinical study enrol critically ill paediatric patient require mechanical ventilation sedation . Subjects closely follow use standard PICU monitoring vital function ( continuous assessment heart rate peripheral arterial oxygen saturation , intermittent assessment systolic diastolic blood pressure ) , intermittent assessment pain depth sedation , documentation parameter mechanical ventilation intermittent arterial blood gas analysis . The study conduct compliance study protocol , Good Clinical Practice ( ICH-GCP ) applicable regulatory requirement ( ) . In addition , qualify PICU staff monitoring subject around clock , thus minimise reaction time case alarm deterioration clinical parameter . This project receive funding European Union 's Seventh Framework Programme research , technological development demonstration grant agreement n° 602453 .</brief_summary>
