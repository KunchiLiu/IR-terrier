	<brief_summary>A new technology call Global Z-Score Neurofeedback Technology ( GZNT ) identify overcome exist barrier use neurofeedback treatment technique military setting . Neurofeedback , EEG Biofeedback , form biofeedback use brain 's electrical activity training parameter . With sufficient practice , brain learn change activity finely tune feedback use computerized sound , graphs animation . Previous attempt use neurofeedback treatment modality subject lack standardization require significant expertise part provider . This new GZNT technology allow neurofeedback administer standardized semi-automated fashion , , effective , represent significant advance toward provide promise treatment modality Service Members military VA set . This study determine feasibility preliminary evidence efficacy neurofeedback technology pilot study soldier medical issue associate Traumatic Brain Injury ( TBI ) . GZNT technology potential provide cost-efficient , non-invasive/non-pharmacological approach recovery impact and/or blast-induced brain injury , hold promise simultaneously address emotional symptom often part post-concussion symptom picture .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neurofeedback Technology ( GZNT ) Persistent Post-Concussive Symptoms Soldiers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research Design : This single group design , treatment effect feasibility study demonstrate GZNT technology , examine electrocortical change , compare emotional/vocational functioning , post concussive symptom intensive GZNT treatment , three month follow-up . Up 50 subject history traumatic brain injury persistent cognitive emotional symptom enrol follow screen baseline evaluation . Resting event-related EEG ( electroencephalograph ) recording , physiological stress evaluation , neuropsychological test , self-report symptom scale , psychosocial/vocational functioning measure perform evaluation . All subject receive study treatment intervention . Subjects schedule receive twenty treatment session GZNT six week period , count complete treatment attend fifteen session . At least twenty-five subject need complete treatment meet statistical requirement study hypothesis . Primary outcome measure include electrocortical index rest mental task state evaluate degree neuro-physiological cortical functional connectivity change follow treatment proxy measure neuroplastic response GZNT training . Secondary outcome include physiological stress response ( objective measure emotional regulation ) , neuropsychological test performance ( objective measure cognition ) , self-reported symptom emotional well-being measure . Feasibility outcomes include number visit complete within six week , number reason drop-outs , adverse event profile , patient satisfaction questionnaire . Methodology/Technical : For pilot study , investigator require twenty-five patient complete study . The investigator therefore recruit many necessary achieve goal , maximum 50 patient . However , since feasibility study , dropout rate reason drop out monitor report . Completion minimum fifteen study treatment visit satisfy requirement `` study completion . '' ( This base clinical experience data technology . ) Therefore , complete fourteen few session within six week study treatment time window count drop out . The planned total number study session study twenty . Data analysis carry pre post metric group complete trial , secondary analysis carry subject use intention-to-treat paradigm , evaluate feasibility , acceptance intervention . Subjects recruit Warrior Recovery Center , Soldier Readiness Center , Evans Army Hospital Primary Care Clinics . Subjects pre-screened sign initial consent complete preliminary set self-report form , follow review medical record order determine eligibility . Following eligibility determination , full consent discussion hold , baseline evaluation complete study visit schedule . For pilot efficacy/feasibility study , study subject receive study treatment intervention . Dose exposure begin 10 minute GZNT first session progress maximum thirty minute train sixth seventh visit , continue thirty minute per visit remainder study .</detailed_description>
