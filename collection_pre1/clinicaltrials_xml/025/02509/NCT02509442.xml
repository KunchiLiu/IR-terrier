	<brief_summary>This study experimental biomedical monocentric search concern twelve patient present infiltrative glioma low rank OMS type II realizing surgery awaken site CHU Montpellier . The objective search understand exactly electric impulse , deliver neurosurgeon make functional mapping brain surgery awaken tumor infiltrates low rank , propagate one identify nervous network inhibit electric impulse . Having verified eligibility patient obtain consent , include study . Before begin surgery , electroencephalography activity brain every patient record . Before surgical resection , electrocorticography activity record . The collect data analyze , operation . Analyses try identify call potential evoke stimulation small electric wave appear electric stimulation deliver .</brief_summary>
