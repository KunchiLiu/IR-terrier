	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( recommended phase II dose , [ RP2D ] ) 8-chloro-adenosine , give single agent , patient relapse refractory acute myeloid leukemia . ( Phase I ) II . To assess tolerability safety 8-chloro-adenosine dose level evaluation toxicity include : type , frequency , severity , attribution , time course duration . ( Phase I ) III . To estimate response rate evaluate antitumor activity 8-chloro-adenosine , give single agent , assess complete remission rate ( complete remission [ CR ] + complete remission incomplete blood count recovery [ CRi ] ) . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate disease response 8-chloro-adenosine refractory/relapsed acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) dose level test . ( Phase I ) II . To obtain estimate remission duration survival probability ( overall event-free ) . ( Phase II ) III . To obtain estimate overall response rate ( CR + CRi + partial response [ PR ] ) . ( Phase II ) IV . To summarize evaluate toxicity type , frequency , severity , attribution , time course duration . ( Phase II ) TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To describe plasma , urinary cellular pharmacokinetics 8-chloro-adenosine metabolite . II . To determine impact 8-chloro-adenosine cellular adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) pool AML blast . III . To assess impact 8-chloro-adenosine therapy select short-lived messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNAs ) correspond protein circulate AML blast . IV . To correlate clinical response toxicity plasma/urine 8-chloro-adenosine level ( pharmacokinetic [ PK ] ) , cellular 8-chloro-ATP ( PK ) cellular ATP pool . V. To determine cytotoxicity 8-chloro-adenosine toward leukemic progenitor cell vitro . VI . To generate preliminary pre-treatment RNA/micro ribonucleic acid ( miRNA ) signature leukemic progenitor cell , explore possible association vitro cytotoxicity 8-chloro-adenosine . VII . To explore possible association preliminary RNA/miRNA signature clinical response 8-chloro-adenosine . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study follow phase II study . Patients receive 8-chloro-adenosine intravenously ( IV ) 60 minute day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
