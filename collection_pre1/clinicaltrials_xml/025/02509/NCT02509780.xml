	<detailed_description>Vichy water type spring water traditionally come famous spa town Vichy , France . The spring fee Vichy carry high amount dissolve mineral , create distinctive naturally effervescent bubbling water . Alkaline salts sodium bicarbonate primary ingredient Vichy water , along calcium magnesium carbonate . The water sometimes slightly odorous , substance like sulfur naturally bubbling water . The water also distinct taste , due dissolve mineral . Bicarbonates alkalinize urine , fundamental prevent and/or dilute uric acid crystal . These main component uric acid stone even oxalate stone , generally `` use `` crystal uric acid nucleus stone formation . Cystine stone also treat alkalinize urine . Three condition influence potential uric acid stone formation : quantitative excretion uric acid , volume urine affect urinary concentration uric acid , urinary pH seem important pathogenic factor . Uric acid weak acid pKa 5.35 37Â° C . At pH , half uric acid present urate salt half free uric acid . Because sodium urate approximately 20 time soluble free acid , relative proportion present free uric acid strongly determinates risk stone formation . Low urinary pH increase concentration sparingly soluble undissociated uric acid , lead direct precipitation uric acid . Any disorder lead low urinary pH ( &lt; 5.5 ) may predispose stone formation . For example chronic metabolic acidosis lead low urinary pH , hypercalciuria hypocitraturia . `` Gouty diathesis `` refers stone - forming propensity characterize low urinary pH unknown etiology without associate gouty arthritis . In context , solution uric acid prevention treatment uric acid stone obtain alkalization urine . The ideal alkalization achieve urinary pH 6-6.5 reach . The aim study evaluate quantity daily intake Vichy water necessary obtain alkalization urine . There data available literature relationship absolute quantity Vichy water take urinary pH ; possible influence Body Mass Index relationship .</detailed_description>
