	<detailed_description>The specific aim study : Aim 1 : Determine effect 12-week Hatha yoga program redox status individual PD . Hypothesis 1a : Participants intervention group great increase total GSH level GSH : GSSG ratio baseline participant wait-list control group . Hypothesis 1b : Compared pre-intervention , wait-list participant higher total GSH level GSH : GSSG ratio receive intervention . Aim 2 : Examine effect 12-week Hatha yoga program motor function ( gait , balance , strength , flexibility , physical activity level ) psychosocial well-being ( mood , cognitive function , sleep quality , QoL ) individual PD . Hypothesis 2a : Participants intervention group great improve score motor Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale ( UPDRS ) , range motion ( ROM ) , biomechanical force platform test , Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI ) , Parkinson 's Disease Sleep Scale ( PDSS ) , Parkinson 's Disease Quality Life Questionnaire ( PDQUALIF ) , Montreal Cognitive Assessment wait-list participant . Hypothesis 2b : Compared pre-intervention , wait-list participant improved score motor UPDRS , ROM , biomechanical force platform test , BDI , PDSS , PDQUALIF receive intervention . Aim 3 : Determine feasibility acceptability Hatha yoga program PD subject , fidelity yoga program . Hypothesis 3 : The program retention rate &gt; 70 % , average attendance rate &gt; 70 % per class , yoga related adverse event report study . Most participant react positively yoga program . Methods Design Sample A randomize controlled trial design two group use : treatment group ( n=10 ) wait-list control group ( n=10 ) . After randomization , participant treatment group receive 60-minute biweekly Hatha yoga 12 week , participant wait-list group receive intervention . Wait-list participant also serve control receive yoga intervention end 12 week treatment group complete program . Participants recruit clinic via flyer , local national PD network . Yoga program use previous PD study incorporate design propose intervention program . 19 , 31 , 32 Two yoga expert specialize musculoskeletal/neurological disorder review program . The yoga intervention class teach Registered Yoga Teacher . Classes hold community center St. Louis Park . Resting blood sample collect Clinical Translational Science Institute ( CTSI ) facility train phlebotomist total GSH redox status analyze co-investigator . Biomechanical assessment survey data collect Konczak laboratory train graduate research assistant . All data collect baseline 12 week treatment wait-list control group . The 12 week data wait-list participant serve second baseline begin intervention program . Their post intervention data collect 24 week post randomization increase power . Study Endpoints : 1 . Primary endpoint : redox status 12 week . 2 . Secondary endpoint : motor function ( gait , balance , strength , flexibility , physical activity level ) psychosocial well-being ( mood , cognitive function , sleep quality , QoL ) 12 week . 3 . Tertiary endpoint : yoga feasibility , acceptability , program fidelity . The sample size 20 , attrition rate 20 % , 78 % power detect effect size 1.0 compare change yoga intervention . Both group within group comparison conduct . Descriptive statistic use analyze report demographic , feasibility , acceptability data . Inferential statistic ( t-test non-parametric equivalent Mann-Whitney , chi-square test ) use analyze objective subjective outcome Aims 1 &amp; 2 . The α level set ≤ .05 .</detailed_description>
