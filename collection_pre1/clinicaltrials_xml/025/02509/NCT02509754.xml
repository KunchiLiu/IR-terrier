	<brief_title>Atrial Fibrillation Ablation Compared Rate Control Strategy Patients With Impaired Left Ventricular Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) common arrhythmia among general population . Its prevalence increase advance age also presence structural heart disease . In particular patient suffer congestive heart failure ( CHF ) low leave ventricular ( LV ) ejection fraction present significantly increase risk develop AF detrimental hemodynamic effect , due loss atrial contraction , fast irregular beat , even relevant compare patient without CHF . In CHF patient rate control widely use strategy manage AF ; fact , prove non-inferior rhythm control strategies concern survival rate . However , adequate ventricular rate difficult achieve ; moreover , rate control strategy , detrimental hemodynamic effect AF persist , lead impair LV function , cardiac output , symptom . This frequently lead fact , despite optimal medical therapy ( OMT ) least 3 month , patient require implantable cardioverter defibrillator ( ICD ) , , case poor rate control AV node ablation resynchronization therapy ( CRT ) . The latter , however , infer pacemaker ( PM ) -dependence , relate negligible risk cardiac rhythm device peri-implantation long-term complication ( infection , lead failure ) . On side rhythm control may represent option . In general population , fact , recent evidence suggest advantage rate control concern survival , quality life thromboembolic event . The main limitation , however , stand achieve rhythm control : antiarrhythmic therapy several side effect ( amiodarone , fact recommend drug , thrive frequent adverse event ) transcatheter AF ablation assess modest sample size study . Available literature focus comparison different management strategy patient CHF AF limit . A small randomize study compare pulmonary vein ( PVs ) isolation AV node ablation biventricular PM implantation , show improved 6-month outcome , define composite end point LV ejection fraction , 6-minutes walking distance Minnesota Living Heart Failure ( MLWHF ) questionnaire , patient treat PVs isolation . However , 81 patient enrol short-term study , hard end point test . More recently , actually ongoing , AATAC-AF study , compare amiodarone catheter ablation patient chronic AF implantable device ( biventricular PM ICD ) . Also case , preliminary result support improve 24 month outcome , term sinus rhythm ( SR ) achievement , quality life LV function , patient undergo AF ablation . In addition direct comparison , indirect evidence support catheter ablation rhythm control . In recent meta-analysis , PVs isolation , linear lesion ablation fragment potential leave atrium , although relatively high need repeat procedure , proven safe also effective improving symptom ( related CHF AF ) , LV function maintain SR . In fact , analysis , 60 % patient leave ventricular function 35 % baseline improve value limit follow AF ablation . We therefore design multicenter , randomize control trial aim ass , recently diagnose ( less 6 month ) optimally treat CHF patient impair LV function , AF catheter ablation effective improve LV function clinical functional class , potentially drive reduction device implantation ( ICD/CRTs ) . The aim present study ass within patient concomitant CHF persistent AF whether AF ablation , compare optimal rate control strategy , superior term LV function clinical functional class . In addition , long-term outcome complication record compare . This study prospective , multicenter , randomize , two-arms parallel-group trial . Randomization perform 24-hour , centralize , computer system . Enrollment occur 5 center Italy . The study protocol receive approval ethic review board institution study enrollment , patient randomize undergo either arm study open fashion , due nature alternative procedure . Written informed consent , include description procedure risk complication , obtain patient study inclusion . At 3 , 6 12 month index procedure complete follow-up visit perform patient study arm . Clinical assessment include sign symptom heart failure , NYHA functional class evaluation , quality life assessment MLWHF questionnaire 12-lead ECG . Additionally , patient undergo complete transthoracic echocardiographic evaluation , include LV ejection fraction , end-diastolic end-systolic volume , LV diastolic function , LA volume , mitral regurgitation stenosis grade , right ventricular diameter systolic function ( TAPSE ) . A 6-minute walking test perform aim reproducibly quantify functional class patient schedule evaluation . A 24-hour ECG Holter perform patient , detect AF recurrence AF ablation arm , mean heart rate ( patient AF SR ) ventricular arrhythmias burden . For patient implanted device , AF burden , ICD intervention percentage biventricular pacing record . Finally , incidence heart failure hospitalization , ischemic hemorrhagic stroke all-cause mortality assess group . Additional clinical assessment perform case heart failure acute worsening . No external source funding contribute study , conflict interest declare . All data independently collect , manage , analyze restricted-access database .
