	<brief_summary>The objective study assess efficacy Artificial Pancreas system include Control-To-Range algorithm , versus standard Insulin Pump Therapy Threshold Low glucose Suspend feature . 24 Children age 7 12 recruted 4 clinical centre . After 2 week run-in period , attend two investigational session 65 hour home-like setting . During session , CTR algorithm TLGS feature activate , depend randomization . The main endpoint time spend 70mg/dL 22:00 07:00 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Artificial Pancreas Versus Threshold Low Glucose Suspend Type 1 Diabetic Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study open randomize control trial precede run-in period follow cross-over design.After inclusion , therapy move sensor augment pump therapy dedicate train continuous glucose monitoring use study system ( study CGM ) . During 2 3 week , patient use his/her usual insulin pump study CGM ( run-in period ) . At end period , patient relative admit parents'house hotel/resort nearby hospital 65 hour undergo first interventional session . Admission 17:00 Day 1 . The investigator connect wirelessly study pump CGM study platform DiAs remote monitor activate . Until 08:00 Day 2 , insulin delivery manage open-loop mode , i.e . insulin dos decide accord capillary glucose measurement . From 08:00 Day 2 , one algorithm activate accord randomization order , i.e . either threshold low glucose suspend ( TLGS ) algorithm ( threshold set 70 mg/dl ) closed-loop algorithm . Insulin delivery manage open-loop mode activate TLGS closed-loop algorithm 08:00 Day 4 . In case , meal free content take around 09:00 , 13:00 , 17:00 20:00 . Meal insulin dos manage accord pre-meal glucose level CHO meal content open-loop mode TLGS , accord DiAs bolus calculator suggestion closed-loop mode . Patient relative encourage move parents'house hotel/resort surroundings meal . The algorithm inactivate 08:00 Day 4 . The study pump remove replaced patient 's usual pump . The patient relative release 10:00 breakfast . Study CGM still use home 2 4 week second interventional session . This session similar first one alternative algorithm activate . Patient come back pre-study insulin therapy 08:00 Day 4 release 10:00 second session complete .</detailed_description>
