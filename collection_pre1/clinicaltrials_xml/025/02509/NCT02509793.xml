	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Assessing Impulsivity Patients With Huntington 's Disease Xenazine ( Tetrabenazine )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study open-label assessment behavioral symptom include depression , impulsivity , suicidal ideation patient prior , , take stable dose TBZ . Once subject provide write informed consent , he/she schedule study visit . All subject evaluate test depression ( Geriatric Depression Scale ) , impulsivity ( Minnesota Impulsivity Scale , QUIP , BIS-11 , computerized impulsivity scale ) , suicidal ideation ( Columbia Suicide Scale ) safety measure actually start take TBZ . Patients ask return clinic identical evaluation plus adverse event , stable dose TBZ 4 week , would 7 Â± 1 week initiate TBZ . Patients titrate 2- 4 week best dose determined investigator , maximum 75 mg/day . In clinical practice , &gt; 90 % HD patient take 75mg less per day . This also allow consistent short titration period improve patient retention . As patient titrate , several telephone contact conduct . The initial dose 12.5 mg BID . Best dose largely determined adverse event . Determination best dose include one schedule phone call others need . Other medication remain stable visit .</detailed_description>
