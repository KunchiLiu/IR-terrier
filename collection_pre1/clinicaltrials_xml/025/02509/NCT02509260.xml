	<detailed_description>Surgical site infection ( SSIs ) common problem significant cause morbidity surgical patient . They present substantial burden health care system United States contribute 1.6 billion dollar excess cost 1 million extra hospital day affect patient . SSIs associate multitude complication include increase risk incisional hernia prolong hospital stay . Despite optimum surgical care remain inability significantly reduce SSI rate follow colorectal surgery field represent critical priority study . When one examine control arm recent high quality randomize control trial , SSI rate follow colorectal surgery range 22.0-26.1 % , emphasize prevalence complication . Many strategy attempt reduce SSI rate . The Centers Medicare Medicaid Services introduce Surgical Care Improvement Project infection project aim reduce SSI incidence morbidity . These measure include prophylactic intravenous antibiotic administer within 1 hour skin incision , appropriate prophylactic antibiotic selection , discontinuation prophylactic antibiotic within 24 hour surgery , appropriate hair removal , maintenance perioperative normothermia . Despite enforcement measure quality report pay-for-performance measure , significant controversy exist overall effectiveness , especially high-risk colorectal surgical population . Laparoscopic surgery show improve SSI rate colorectal population ; however , patient appropriate candidate approach inability promising intervention wound edge protection6 gentamicin sponges4 improve SSI rate follow colorectal surgery mandate investigation novel technique . Initiated orthopaedic literature , new technique wound dress describe reduce SSI . Incisional negative pressure wound therapy ( NPWT ) use device Prevena™ involve apply wound vacuum sponge standard wound closure ( include fascial closure skin closure staple ) . The incisional NPWT dressing leave place 5 7 day removal . A recent retrospective study Bonds et al . describe ability incisional NPWT reduce SSI rate open colorectal surgery 29.3-12.5 % . The aim current study ass clinical effectiveness incisional NPWT reduce SSI rate open , re-operative colorectal surgery . The primary endpoint study occurrence superficial SSI within 30 day surgery secondary endpoint include , length hospital stay cost effectiveness .</detailed_description>
