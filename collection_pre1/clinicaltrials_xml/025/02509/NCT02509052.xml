	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) recommend phase II dose ( RP2D ) leflunomide , give single agent . ( Phase I ) II . To assess safety tolerability leflunomide dose level evaluation toxicity include : type , frequency , severity , attribution , time course duration . ( Phase I ) III . To evaluate anti-myeloma activity leflunomide , give single agent , assess overall response rate ( ORR ) . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To obtain estimate : response duration , clinical benefit response , overall survival , progression-free survival . ( Phase II ) TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To characterize relationship serum concentration active leflunomide metabolite , teriflunomide ( A77 1726 ) , toxicity . ( Phase I/II ) II . To assess relationship serum concentration active leflunomide metabolite , teriflunomide ( A77 1726 ) , disease response . ( Phase I/II ) III . To explore relationship polymorphism CYP1A2 , CYP2C19 , DHODH gene toxicity/response . ( Phase I/II ) IV . To explore ex vivo cytotoxicity leflunomide toward primary multiple myeloma ( MM ) cell , order evaluate whether individual ex vivo leflunomide response might useful predictor therapeutic response . ( Phase I/II ) V. To explore potential additive synergistic effect combine leflunomide class Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) -approved drug . ( Phase I/II ) VI . To generate preliminary ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) /microRNA ( miRNA ) deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) methylation signature associate response MM cell leflunomide vivo ( mRNA/miRNA DNA methylation , phase II ) teriflunomide ex vivo ( messenger RNA [ mRNA ] /miRNA ) . ( Phase I/II ) OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive leflunomide orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day every 28 day disease progression ( active follow-up ) every 3 month ( long term follow-up ) .</detailed_description>
