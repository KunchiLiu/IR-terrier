	<brief_title>A Study CC-122 Assess Safety Tolerability Japanese Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma ( NHL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase 1 , multicenter , open-label , dose-escalation study evaluate safety , tolerability , ( Pharmacokinetics ) PK , preliminary efficacy CC-122 Japanese subject advance solid tumor Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma ( NHL ) . Subjects receive ascend dose level CC-122 Cycle 1 onwards measure PK determine safety tolerability . An initial cohort least three subject give CC-122 dose 2.0 mg intermittent dose schedule ( 5 continuous day 7 day per week ) 3-6 subject enrol subsequent dose level . Dose escalation subsequent cohort proceed accord standard dose escalation design ( 3+3 design ) ( Storer , 1989 ) establish initial toxicity .</detailed_description>
