This feasibility study examine incremental efficacy HRT+DCS HRT+placebo tic target HRT . Eligibility criterion parallel child CBIT trial generalizability comparability , addition DCS contraindication exclusionary criterion . Parents youth complete battery clinical assessment ascertain tic symptom severity co-occurring psychiatric condition . Afterwards , participant randomly assign receive either HRT+DCS HRT+placebo . Instead full course HRT ( 8 session 10 week ) , efficient Quick-Win/Fast-Fail trial design use include truncated HRT protocol provide result timely fashion . As result trial design , primary outcome study focus reduction bothersome tic severity target treatment rather global severity reduction .</brief_summary>
