	<brief_summary>Currently dose prophylaxis individualize , general approach use dose 25-40 units/kg give 3 time per week every day . One issue weight-based dose possible over-treatment . This likely due fact laboratory test sensitive enough low level support decision-making . The Thromboelastograph ( TEG® ) Thromboelastometry ( ROTEM® ) coagulation device , ass dynamic clot formation time several characteristic suggest may provide important information individualize prophylaxis treatment patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Individualizing Hemophilia Prophylaxis Using Thromboelastography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot study child adult severe hemophilia A utilizes TEG/ROTEM personalize prophylaxis treatment . Primary objective : • Assess feasibility TEG/ROTEM-guided modification current prophylaxis regimen individual severe hemophilia A . Specifically , : - Test refine operational protocol use TEG/ROTEM guide factor dose - Estimate proportion hemophilia A patient whose dose modify base TEG/ROTEM result - Monitor short term safety patient whose dose modify . Secondary objective - Perform thrombin generation assay provide additional evidence support TEG/ROTEM-guided dosing . - Obtain preliminary data economic impact TEG/ROTEM-guided hemophilia A dosing regimen . - Obtain preliminary data potential improvement subject/family burden result TEG/ROTEM-guided regimen use generic specific quality life tool . The study period consist screening , pharmacokinetic ( PK ) study follow-up . For subject whose prophylaxis treatment regimen modify , follow-up period include 3 follow-up clinic visit 4 follow-up phone call ; patient remain study approximately 6 month follow completion PK-study end study visit ( visit 9 ) . Subjects whose treatment regimen alter end study participation Visit 2 continue current prophylaxis regimen . Study endpoint : A safety review conduct first 6 subject complete 30 day extend prophylaxis treatment . If safety issue identify , study proceed , second safety review additional 8 subject complete 30 day extend treatment . If subject two spontaneous bleeds 30 day , subject remove study . For subject bleeds complete least 6 month study , ongoing prophylactic treatment decide treat physician .</detailed_description>
