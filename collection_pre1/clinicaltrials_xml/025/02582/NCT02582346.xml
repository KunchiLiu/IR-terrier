	<brief_title>Assessment Magnetic Resonance Imaging Neurography Tractography Preoperative Mapping Pelvic Nerves</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nerves autonomic nervous system frequently damage pelvic surgery , injury may lead postoperative complication like incontinence impotence . This study aim develop image protocol provide image nerve visualize segment . A simple preoperative MRI exam might yield individualized mapping pelvic nerve would combine augmented reality , thereby provide valuable support guide surgeon intervention indicate location nerve preserve . Up , investigation carry 1.5 Tesla ( 1.5T ) MRI system animal model ( pig ) . MRI non irradiant non invasive imaging modality prove valuable method visualize small structure like nerve . Investigations focus MRI neurography , anatomical imaging method highlight nerve , MRI tractography , diffusion-tensor-based imaging method allow reconstruction nervous fiber . However , swine model ideal due major difference human , particularly fact human pelvis contain lot fat unlike swine pelvis , interesting feature good contrast fat tissue MRI . Therefore , important perform new investigation healthy volunteer refine assess MRI acquisition . Those investigation perform 3Tesla ( 3T ) system manufacturer , provide sequence high field strength offer high signal . There injection contrast agent . The protocol use standard sequence manufacturer parameter adjust purpose study . The image quality score 5-point Likert scale ( 0 = possible delineation 4=nerves entirely visible ) .</detailed_description>
