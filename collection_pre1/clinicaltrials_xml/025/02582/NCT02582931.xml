	<brief_summary>The investigator propose evaluate feasibility , safety , preliminary efficacy deliver online , adaptive magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) -guided gate stereotactic body radiation therapy patient recurrent metastatic ovarian cancer novel , integrate Co-60 MRI treatment machine . To best ass technology , investigator focus patient three site progressive disease within central thorax , liver , and/or non-liver abdominopelvis receive adaptive , MRI-guided gate SBRT MRI simulation . Patients treat five fraction one two week . By adhere strict normal tissue constraint , expect toxicity within current standard care allow adaptation base daily anatomic change . The prescription dose determine base hard normal tissue constraint , cap 10Gy per fraction . Although long term goal achieve improve local control disease-free survival reduce toxicity , present study drive short term goal demonstrate feasibility novel treatment approach recurrent metastatic ovarian cancer .</brief_summary>
