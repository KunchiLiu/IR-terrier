	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy PDL-0101 Patients With Hyperlipidemias : Pilot Study .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This 8 week , multicenter , randomize , double blind , placebo control trial . The screen visit divide two part , `` pre-screen '' in-clinic rapid lipid test ( Cholestech ) follow full screening blood draw send central reference laboratory ( CRL ) subject meet Cholestech inclusion value TG LDL ( see inclusion criterion ) pre-screen test . Subjects meet pre-screen criterion discharge participation study . Subjects must pre-screen lipid value LDL &gt; /=70 mg/dl triglyceride ( TG ) &gt; /=180 &lt; /=499 . Subjects meet Cholestech criterion blood draw central reference laboratory ( CRL ) screen test . For randomization , 80 % subject must TG &gt; /=200 mg/dl proceed next screening step 20 % allow proceed next screening step TG=150-199 mg/dl long LDL &gt; /=70 mg/dl . Subjects meet CRL pre-screen lipid inclusion criterion return 2-14 day later remainder full screening procedure . Subjects meet screen criterion randomize visit . Thus , prescreening screening-1 visit occur time screen 2 visit also baseline visit . BMI calculate criterion participation . Subjects meet inclusion exclusion requirement screen 2/baseline visit randomize receive one two ( 2 ) study product . Randomization proceed group 5 4 subject TG 200-499 mg/dl randomize subject TG 150-199 mg/dl . Subjects return evaluation 4 8 week baseline visit time adverse event ( AEs ) record , blood lipid study do subject complete VAS product tolerability . Laboratory study draw subject sit least 5 minute .</detailed_description>
