	<brief_summary>In investigation investigator would like find two commonly use technique management palatally impact canine : closed-window ( CWT ) open-window ( OWT ) , produce favorable outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Closed Window vs. Open Window Technique Management Palatally Impacted Canines</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale objective : Two technique expose palatally impact canine routinely use , close window technique ( CWT ) open window technique ( OWT ) . To knowledge , evidence-based information would suggest , two technique result well outcome . Our null hypothesis difference outcome expose impacted maxillary canine CWT OWT . Study design : A randomized clinical multicentre trial two-group design . The randomization canine , patient . Study population : The case group consist healthy person 11-17 year old unilateral palatally impacted canine . Intervention : One group treat CWT group OWT . Main study parameters/endpoints : The main outcome measure total duration treatment ( include also orthodontic treatment ) two technique management impact canine . The secondary outcome measure : ( 1 ) duration surgical procedure , ( 2 ) patient perception pain recovery surgery , ( 3 ) burden care , ( 4 ) cost-effectiveness , ( 5 ) quality life satisfaction treatment , ( 6 ) degree root resorption lateral incisor , ( 7 ) periodontal status impact canine adjacent teeth , ( 8 ) esthetic outcome , ( 9 ) need endodontic treatment impacted canine adjacent lateral incisor , ( 10 ) occlusal outcome ( evaluate PAR index ) . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : The CWT OWT current treatment technique . To knowledge , sound scientific information available base treatment decision . The burden treatment patient . Routine pre- post-treatment record take . The extra burden patient participate trial record questionnaires treatment long-term</detailed_description>
