	<brief_summary>Changes mood cognition common old adulthood . Some study suggest transcranial application near-infrared ( NIR ) light may enhance effect cognitive mood status young adult individual traumatic brain injury . This effect examine old adult . This study involve randomize sham-controlled trial learn whether NIR stimulation improve cognition mood old adult , relative sham treat control .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Revitalize Cognition : Near Infrared Stimulation Older Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There dearth clinically meaningful treatment option point time individual increase risk transition dementia , particularly amnestic variant mild cognitive impairment ( aMCI ) . While wait causative cure preventive approach , investigator face task identify modify therapy might alter course slow transition normal cognition MCI dementia . The propose study hop contribute mission test viability different type intervention , one involve transcranial delivery near-infrared ( NIR ) wavelength ( 808-904nm ) . Near-infrared stimulation safe , non-invasive appear improve mitochondrial function promote increase production intracellular adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) possibly improve blood flow . Perhaps compelling recent finding reduce beta-amyloid neurofibrillary tangle transgenic Alzheimer 's mouse model exposure real v sham transcranial NIR stimulation . Preliminary human involve traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) , stroke , young adult population also promise term positive effect NIR cognition . The overall goal present study learn whether unconventional NIR stimulation approach potential improve cognition old adult . To , investigator conduct randomize sham control pilot trial . The intervention involve six session , 2-week period real sham stimulation transcranially apply use delivery system FDA-approved nonsignificant risk since 2003 . Researchers hope learn whether NIR stimulation , relative sham , positive effect cognition mood old adult .</detailed_description>
