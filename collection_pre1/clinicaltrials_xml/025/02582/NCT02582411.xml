	<brief_summary>Some prevalent eye diseases age-related macular degeneration , glaucoma diabetic retinopathy associate ocular perfusion abnormality . Currently , gold-standard method measurement ocular blood flow available . Laser speckle flowgraphy promise technique two-dimensional assessment ocular blood flow human . So far technique , however , gain widespread use Japan . The experience Caucasian subject limit . In Japanese population show mean blur rate , measure chorioretinal blood velocity , decrease age . This relevance , age-related decline ocular blood flow may partially explain age-dependence ocular vascular disease . The present study investigate age-dependence healthy subject . In addition , investigator investigate sub-group population whether relative flow volume ( RFV ) , novel index blood flow human retina derive laser speckle flowgraphy associate retinal blood flow assess bi-directional Doppler Optical Coherence Tomography ( DOCT ) .</brief_summary>
