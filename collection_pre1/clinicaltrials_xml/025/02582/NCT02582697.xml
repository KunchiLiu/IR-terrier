	<brief_title>Accelerated v 's Standard BEP Chemotherapy Patients With Intermediate Poor-risk Metastatic Germ Cell Tumours</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bleomycin , Etoposide , Cisplatin ( BEP ) administer 3-weekly x 4 remain standard 1st line chemotherapy intermediate- poor-risk metastatic germ cell tumour ( GCTs ) . Cure rate 90 % good-risk disease , 85 % intermediate-risk , 70 % poor-risk disease . Previous strategy improve first-line chemotherapy fail improve cure rate toxic BEP . New strategy need patient intermediate poor-risk disease . BEP accelerate cycle Cisplatin etoposide 2-weekly instead 3-weekly . The Australian New Zealand Urogenital Prostate Cancer Trials Group ( ANZUP ) conduct trial comparing accelerate BEP standard BEP . The aim study determine accelerate BEP superior standard BEP first-line chemotherapy intermediate poor risk metastatic GCTs .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Male gender 2 . Age ≥ 16 year ≤ 45 year date randomisation 3 . Histologically cytologically confirm germ cell tumour ( nonseminoma seminoma ) ; Exceptionally raise tumour marker ( AFP ≥ 1000ng/mL and/or HCG ≥ 5000 IU/L ) without histologic cytologic confirmation rare case pattern metastasis consistent GCT , high tumour burden , need start therapy urgently 4 . Primary arise testis , retroperitoneum , mediastinum 5 . Metastatic disease mediastinal primary 6 . Intermediate poor prognosis define IGCCC classification3 ( modify different LDH criterion intermediate risk nonseminoma ) . ( See protocol information ) . 7 . Adequate bone marrow function ANC ≥1.0 x 109/L , Platelet count ≥100 x 109/L 8 . Adequate liver function bilirubin must ≤1.5 x ULN , except participant Gilbert 's Syndrome bilirubin must ≤2.0 x ULN ; ALT AST must ≤2.5 x ULN , except elevation due hepatic metastasis , case ALT AST must ≤ 5 x ULN 9 . Adequate renal function estimate creatinine clearance ≥60 ml/min accord CockcroftGault formula ( see Appendix 5 ) , unless calculate &lt; 60 ml/min borderline case GFR formally measure , eg . EDTA scan 10 . ECOG Performance Status 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 ( see Appendix 4 ) 11 . Study treatment plan able start within 14 day randomisation . 12 . Willing able comply study requirement , include treatment , time nature require assessment 13 . Able provide sign , write informed consent 1 . Other primary malignancy ( EXCEPT adequately treat nonmelanomatous carcinoma skin , germ cell tumour , malignancy treat least 5 year previously evidence recurrence ) 2 . Previous chemotherapy radiotherapy , except patient pure seminoma relapse adjuvant radiotherapy adjuvant chemotherapy 12 dos single agent carboplatin patient nonseminoma poor prognosis IGCCC criterion rare case lowdose induction chemotherapy give prior registration patient fit enough receive protocol chemotherapy ( eg . organ failure , vena cava obstruction , overwhelm burden disease ) . In instance acceptable regimen include cisplatin 20 mg/m2 day 12 etoposide 100 mg/m2 day 12 ; carboplatin AUC 3 day 12 etoposide 100 mg/m2 day 12 ; babyBOP.37 Patients must meet inclusion exclusion criterion time registration . Additionally participant need start therapy urgently prior complete studyspecific baseline investigation may commence study chemotherapy prior registration randomisation . Such patient must discuss coordinate centre prior registration , must register within 10 day commence study chemotherapy . 3 . Significant cardiac disease result inability tolerate IV fluid hydration cisplatin 4 . Significant comorbid respiratory disease contraindicate use bleomycin 5 . Peripheral neuropathy ≥ grade 2 clinically significant sensorineural hearing loss tinnitus 6 . Concurrent illness , include severe infection may jeopardize ability participant undergo procedure outline protocol reasonable safety 7 . Inadequate contraception . Men must use 2 effective method contraception , include use condom , chemotherapy year complete chemotherapy . 8 . Known allergy hypersensitivity study drug 9 . Presence psychological , familial , sociological geographical condition opinion investigator would hamper compliance study protocol followup schedule , include alcohol dependence drug abuse</criteria>
