	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate proportion patient smoke ( successful quitter ) 12 month post-radiation therapy ( RT ) /chemotherapy radiation therapy ( CRT ) compare proportion two study arm . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare proportion patient smoke 6 month post-RT/CRT two study arm . II . Among patient quit smoking , determine proportion patient experience smoke relapse 12 month post-RT/CRT compare two study arm . III . To compare maximum degree mucositis mucositis-related pain radiation treatment follow week post-treatment two study arm . IV . Determine impact study treatment anxiety , depression quality life ( QOL ) compare two study arm . V. Collect descriptive data assess smoking status among caregiver correspond data concern whether smoke relapse occur patient population . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 arm . ARM A : Patients receive bupropion hydrochloride orally ( PO ) 3 day twice daily ( BID ) 1 year post RT/CRT . ARM B : Patients receive smoke cessation treatment tailor individual smoker base preference , smoke history contra-indications . Patients give choice one National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( NCCN ) -recommended first-line pharmacotherapy option smoke cessation comprise varenicline PO daily 1 week BID 12 week combination nicotine patch acute nicotine replacement therapy ( NRT ) 12 week . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Treatment varenicline NRT extend 6 month 1 year need . After completion study , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
