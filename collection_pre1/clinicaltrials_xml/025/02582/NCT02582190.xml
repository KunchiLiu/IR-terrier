	<brief_summary>There substantial evidence link inflammation initiation perpetuation AF . Although precise mechanism inflammation contribute development AF remain unclear , propose inflammation may lead `` atrial myocarditis '' subsequent electrical structural change involve atrial myocytes extracellular matrix , lead finally initiation maintenance AF . The high incidence AF post-operative cardiac surgery , state intense inflammatory process , point association . Similarly , non operative AF , inflammation appear play prominent role etiology maintenance AF . Indeed increase inflammatory marker paroxysmal persistent AF show numerous study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>COlchicine Prevention Post Electrical Cardioversion Recurrence AF</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In particular , CRP level patient persistent AF high paroxysmal AF , level group high control group . Moreover , hs-CRP IL-6 level report marker may identify patient high risk AF recurrence successful electrical cardioversion ( EC ) , provide prognostic information regard immediate long-term success EC . CRP acute-phase protein reliable marker systemic inflammation . CRP show specifically bind phosphatidylcholine membrane myocardial cell inhibit exchange sodium calcium ion sarcolemma vesicle , promote therefore AF development . CRP may also play part structural remodeling ; may induce apoptotic loss atrial myocytes calcium accumulation within atrial myocytes AF participate also clearance apoptotic atrial myocytes opsonin . Myocyte loss typically accompanied replacement fibrosis provide substrate AF development . IL-6 one important stimulus CRP release . As strong stimulus macrophage , TNF-α upstream cascade activate macrophage release number cytokine include IL-6 . Whether inflammatory effect consequence AF presence pre-existing systemic inflammatory status promote AF development remain unclear . However , accumulative proof imply mechanism may interrelate , suggest inflammatory marker consequence also cause . Consequently , pharmacological intervention pleiotropic/anti-inflammatory effect might efficacious prevention AF modulate inflammatory pathway . ( 17 ) Keeping , several agent anti inflammatotory property statins , fatty acid , oral glucocorticoid , nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug , angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor administer controversial result . Colchicine lipid-soluble drug classify anti-inflammatory agent . It exert anti-inflammatory action without involve arachidonic acid pathway affect NSAIDs glucocorticosteroids . The anti-inflammatory effect colchicine attribute ability disrupt assembly microtubules immune-mediated cell . By inhibit tubulin polymerization , colchicine prevents activation , degranulation , migration neutrophil , know initiate factor inflammatory process . It also find increase leukocyte cyclic adenosine monophosphate level , inhibit interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) production activate neutrophils down-regulate tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNFa ) receptor macrophages endothelial cell . Clinical evidence support colchicine administration reduce significantly incidence AF post-cardiac surgery ( POAF ) post-AF ablation effect attribute drug anti-inflammatory action . Of note , effect accompany significant decrease inflammatory mediator , IL-6 CRP show post-AF ablation patient . ( 33 ) Additional mechanism may play also role reduction POAF post-ablation AF vitro animal study show colchicine administration exert electrophysiological effect relate cytoskeletal disruption . All patient undergo echocardiography blood examination ( include thyroid function , renal liver function test , lipid assessment , international normalize ratio foul blood cell count ) EC . Blood sample CRP , IL-6 TNFa measurement obtain immediately ECV ( day 0 ) , one day successful ECV ( day 1 ) 3 day colchicine treatment ( day 4 ) . Anticoagulation therapy institute accord current guideline . If indication transesophageal echocardiography perform prior EC . The protocol electrical cardioversion follow : shock deliver external paddle position anterior-apex position connect external electrical cardioverter biphasic external cardioversion . The first shock energy deliver 200 J follow step-up protocol ( 300 J ) . In case unsuccessful ECV , second attempt anteroposterior position could make . ECV consider successful sinus rhythm remain 24 hrs procedure . Successfully cardioverted patient enter maintenance phase study treatment continue 6 month</detailed_description>
