	<brief_summary>Surgery effective treatment morbid obesity divide restrictive surgery ( Lap Band Sleeve gastrectomy ) , malabsorptive surgery ( Biliary pancreatic deviation duodenal switch ) combination ( RYGBP ) . This late technique common effective surgical procedure perform worldwide process effective treatment morbid obesity complication , achieve excess weight loss 65 80 % ; 1-2 year surgery ( 1,2 ) . Vertical gastric plication novel surgical approach reduce stomach capacity . Anterior surface plication great curvature plication variation vertical gastric plication reduce gastric capacity infolding anterior surface great curvature stomach , respectively . These approach test , positive result ( 3,4 ) . A transoral endoluminal approach ( ie , procedure require incision , access grant mouth ) offer potential additional benefit patient , procedure continue become minimally invasive . Advances endoluminal device allow clinician ability begin explore bariatric procedure perform via flexible endoscopy . Although procedure may effective surgical counterpart , less-invasive option may relieve patient significant risk associate surgery ( 5 ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Prospective Study Evaluate Efficacy Endoluminal-suturing Device ( Endomina TM ) Aid Endoscopic Gastric Reduction .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Endomina ( Endo Tools Therapeutics , Nivelles , Belgium ) CE mark robot drive device may attach endoscope inside body allow remote manipulation arm device peroral intervention . It offer possibility make transoral surgical full thickness suture may allow performing , via transoral route . After first trial pig ( safety ) second trial human . This trial include 11 patient treat technique . There complication short term result encourage . Study design : Prospective , non-randomized , interventional , open-label , multi-center efficacy study . Objectives : Study evaluate efficacy endoluminal vertical gastroplasty ( EVG ) use endoluminal-suturing device . In literature efficacy endoluminal technique define loss weight 25 % excess weight loss ( EWL ) sustain 1 year ( 6 ) . Endpoints Secondary endpoint : Efficacy Information efficacy obtain measurement total weight loss excess weight loss 12 month Secondary endpoint : Safety Safety characterize incidence Adverse Device Effects ( ADEs ) , non-serious serious , possibly relate related procedure and/or device experience study participant . In addition , safety assessment determine base physical examination ( vital sign ) laboratory test schedule visit . Safety evaluation also perform ensure subsequent adverse event occur ensure adverse event trial consider on-going stable resolve . Safety assess 1 , 3 , 6 12 month follow intervention . Sample size •40 patient enrol Based result previous study , beta power 80 % alpha error 5 % , number patient need detect 25 % EWL reduction one year 34 . Considering lose follow-up 10 % , 40 patient require . Study duration : •6 month enrolment 12 month follow Overall design This prospective , non-randomized , open-label , multi-center , interventional , efficacy study . A period approximately 6 month anticipate form time first patient enrol completion last patient . There randomization study . Once baseline eligibility criterion meet patient undergo treatment protocol . A subject consider `` enrolled '' he/she sign informed consent , pass screen criterion undergone procedure . Criteria discontinuation If subject discontinues participation study , contact order obtain information reason ( ) discontinuation collection potential AEs . The Investigator document reason Subject Withdrawal Patient Case Report Form ( CRF ) . Discontinued patient follow AEs resolve Investigator decide follow-up longer necessary . Study Design : Devices use protocol In addition Endomina device ( provided companionate Endotools Options ) require endoscopic accessory use procedure . Point enrollment A subject consider `` enrolled '' he/she sign informed consent , pass screen criterion agree procedure . Study duration number subject A period approximately 6 month anticipate form time time first patient enrol completion last patient . Lab test screen procedure occur early 30 day prior schedule procedure . The participant follow follow : - Day ( -1 ) : Admission - Day ( 0 ) : Procedure - Day ( +1 ) : Clinical Follow discharge ( i.e . adverse effect observe ) - 1 month : Clinical assessment - 3 month : Follow endoscopy , Clinical assessment - 6 month : Clinical assessment - 12 month : Clinical endoscopic assessment On Parallel nutritional specialist monitor patient quarterly basis ( 1,3,6,12 ) . Study procedures The intervention perform general anesthesia tracheal intubation . Endomina introduce stomach guide wire fix endoscope . The procedure include placement 4-6 transmural anterior-posterior suture argon plasma coagulation tissue opposition area order ensure persistence pouch reduction . Patient keep overnight procedure .</detailed_description>
