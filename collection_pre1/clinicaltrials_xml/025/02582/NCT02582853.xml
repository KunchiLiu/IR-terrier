	<detailed_description>Guillain- Barré syndrome ( GBS ) acute inflammatory demyelinate polyneuropathy ( AIDP ) often trigger infection . GBS characterize progress weakness numbness loss tendon reflex . It also include tingle sensation leg arm . These symptom occur due autoimmune attack myelin result demyelination . The diagnosis give electrophysiological examination clinical presentation . GBS treat intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIG ) plasma exchange ( PE ) . The specific mechanism fully understood , believed antibody produce myelin , eliminate avoid damage peripheral nerve . IVIG slightly safer easy give PE . However , treatment equally effective . They need give first week symptom . Most patient recover completely , others must ease symptom reduce duration illness several treatment . Moreover , initial phase GBS follow long recovery period intensive neurorehabilitation important . Some people recover completely GBS experience long-term complication able walk unaided , loss sensation cause lack coordination balance . It estimate around 20 % people GBS still experience muscle weakness three year . Some may also persistent fatigue . In rare case , complication life threatening , particularly acute phase . GBS one neurological emergency , patient need examine closely initial acute phase illness . Many study perform elucidate mechanism neuropathy Guillain Barré syndrome treatment remain disappointing . There findings autoantibody gangliosides , myelin proteins PO- glycoprotein , P2 basic protein PMP22 nodal paranodal protein , NF155 NF186 . Cluster differentiation 163 ( CD-163 ) - new way measure GBS CD-163 scavenger receptor ( recognizes uptake macromolecule ) , mark monocyte-macrophage activation . CD163 work macrophage receptor haemoglobin-haptoglobin complex . The soluble form receptor call sCD163 find plasma , regulate large range inflammatory disease . Values , increase strongly ( &lt; 20mg/l ) , see disease like macrophage activate syndrome , haemophagocytic syndrome acute hepatic failure . Furthermore , level sCD163 reflect activity disease . Patients increase high value find unfavourable prognosis . Increased value ( 5-20 mg/l ) see hepatic disease , sepsis Gaucher´s disease . Septic patient value great 10mg/l 10 time great risk fatal outcome . Values , slightly increase ( 3-5 mg/l ) , often see inflammatory infectious condition cancer . Purpose Hypothesis Purpose To define concentration sCD163 cerebrospinal fluid serum patient GBS patient compare control . The project hypothesis Our hypothesis inflammatory biomarker sCD163 increase CSF blood GBS patient compare control Perspectives Due various clinical variant inflammatory polyneuropathies due lack biomarkers , remain difficult diagnose GBS . It important identify new method diagnosis monitoring patient GBS . This may also enable good prediction prognosis level treatment need . The pathology GBS still unknown know immune mediate . In several study sCD163 show regulated large range inflammatory disease suggest sCD163 relevant biomarker GBS . Study population The study population consist two subgroup : 1 . Patients diagnose GBS Patients undergo lumbar puncture part diagnostic procedure soon suspect suffer GBS clinical ground blood test . The procedure blood test repeat 6 month . 2 . Symptomatic control Controls include patient unspecified neurological symptom disease undergo lumbar puncture Department Neurology Aarhus University Hospital part diagnostic work irrespective study . The investigator expect include 40 symptomatic control . Due admission Department Neurology , Aarhus University Hospital diagnosis suspect GBS eligible participant receive information project ask give consent participation . As mentioned control recruit patient , nevertheless undergo lumbar puncture another reason Department Neurology , inform project ask participate . Control patient participate . The investigator anticipate include 20 patient GBS 40 symptomatic control . Participants receive write oral information study . The oral information take place Department Neurology , Aarhus University Hospital . Moreover , pamphlet `` Før du deltager et sundhedsvidenskabeligt forsøg '' ( participate clinical trial ) hand . The information give consultant Henning Andersen , MD Lars Markvardsen stud . med . Malalai Musleh . It possible participant bring companion offer hour consider participation procedure lumbar puncture take place day . If patient need consider participation companion possible participant bring companion within hour , include study . The participant inform information medical record pass include use project include past medical history , actual use drug , result biochemical analysis brain imaging , abnormalities clinical examination conclusion doctor diagnostic workup . If new knowledge disadvantage participate study appear participant inform immediately . Moreover , participant inform evaluation study bring knowledge general health status patient , unless clearly reject patient . By end study possible participant contact study coordinator get information study result . Method All source data study store accord Danish legislation study approve Danish Data Protection Agency . Lumbar puncture Serum The participation imply extraction 2-3 ml spinal fluid blood sample 10 ml , use analysis sCD163 . Spinal fluid blood sample draw procedure diagnostic sample . For GBS patient repeat blood test perform 2-4 week 6 month . The extraction blood sample 10 ml repeat test . A repeated lumbar puncture perform 6 month well , extraction amount also 2-3ml spinal fluid . The patient full right say repeat procedure . The symptomatic control spinal fluid blood sample draw . Other examination Patients GBS undergo clinical examination follow neuropathy score : Participants evaluate clinically : Neuropathy Impairment Score ( NIS ) : The NIS composite clinical scoring system widely use objectively assess severity peripheral neuropathy . The NIS quantifies finding neurologic examination attribute score ( range 0 [ normal ] 88 [ total impairment ] ) clinical abnormality note physical assessment sensation , muscle power , tendon reflex . Overall Disability Sum Score ( ODSS ) : The ODSS seem valid sensible measure score dysfunction disability patient motor neuropathy . This score compose arm leg disability scale total score range 0 ( sign disability ) 12 ( severe disability score ) . The patient observer judge activity : affect , affect prevent prevented . Analyses The spinal fluid serum analyse Medical Research Laboratory . The spinal fluid blood sample deposit research biobank Aarhus University Hospital . The plan carry biochemical analysis time sample collect . Any excess biological material transfer biobank future research . Serum CSF analyze sCD163 inflammatory marker , already establish technique Department Clinical Medicine , Aarhus University Hospital spinal fluid examine spectrometry . Statistics GBS rare disease low number patient , difficult perform power calculation study GBS patient . However , investigator anticipate 20 patient 40 control sufficient . The program STATA use statistical analysis . Parametric non- parametric test use depend normal distribution data . In statistical analysis 5 % level significance use . Ethical consideration The local Ethics Committee Central Region Denmark approve study . The test perform patient involve research project lumbar puncture , blood sample clinical examination . A lumbar puncture procedure use collect cerebral spinal fluid ( CSF ) analysis . CSF promise source biomarkers GBS since proximal nerve root , affect early disease , close anatomical contact CSF space . During procedure hollow needle use penetrate spinal canal level third- to-fourth fourth-to-fifth lumbar vertebra low back . CSF drip needle collect . It involve risk perform lumbar puncture , include post lumbar puncture headache incidence 12 % , common young patient . Most frequently , headache short duration may cure application blood -patch . Moreover , lumbar puncture cause temporary lumbar pain accumulation blood underneath skin . There low risk bleed epidural space compression spinal nerve even low risk infection ( meningitis meningoencephalitis ) . However , important highlight lumbar puncture perform routine diagnostic GBS patient ; therefore cause participant problem . The investigator consider project ethically acceptable consider low risk involve project , seriousness cost disease potential identify relevant biomarker GBS . At time diagnostic work-up consequently research project investigator respect patient mental physical condition . The research project carry accord Act Processing Personal Data , furthermore , project submit common regional information system Region Midtjylland Publications Positive , negative inconclusive result publish international journal Malalai Musleh first author , Professor Henning Andersen senior author Lars Markvardsen co-author .</detailed_description>
