	<brief_title>Buscopan Versus Acetaminophen Acute Abdominal Pain Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute abdominal pain common complaint among paediatric patient visit emergency department ( ED ) . Functional abdominal pain associate surgical infectious etiology frequent cause painful abdominal cramp . Although functional abdominal pain life-threatening , significant impact quality life , functional outcome , patient satisfaction . It major source school work absence , loss sleep , extracurricular impairment . Despite , analgesia traditionally withheld patient acute abdominal pain . The reason behind likely two-fold . First , good evidence clinician fear analgesia mask sign underlie surgical pathology appendicitis . There current publish literature support practice . In fact , recent evidence find provide analgesia child obscure sign acute surgical abdomen lead clinically significant difference negative outcome . Second , standard care specify best analgesic option treat abdominal pain child post-codeine era . Although acetaminophen , ibuprofen , ketorolac , buscopan , almagel/viscous lidocaine frequently use agent ED , evidence benefit child functional abdominal pain lacking . As predictable result , patient present abdominal pain fail experience pain relief discharge . The importance provide optimal pain treatment echo several national international level policy statement . In addition World Health Organization ( WHO ) 's mandate adequate pain treatment fundamental human right , American Academy Pediatrics ( AAP ) reaffirm position adequate analgesia provide child . Furthermore , literature support provide analgesia improves patient care , caregiver satisfaction , therapeutic relationship . Antispasmodics commonly use agent treat abdominal cramping . Hyoscine butylbromide ( HBB ) , trade name : Buscopan , anticholinergic agent orally administer , cross blood brain barrier minimal systemic absorption . Therefore , inhibits bowel motility without central nervous system peripheral side effect . This antispasmodic use clinical practice 60 year specifically market since 1952 treatment abdominal cramp . It widely available around world prescription drug counter medication many industrialized country . It also use safely neonates child . As hyoscine butylbromide barely absorb , generally well tolerate . In two large-scale study almost 1200 patient compare HBB placebo ( paracetamol ) , significant difference adverse event two group , include commonly associate anticholinergic , nausea , constipation , dry mouth , blur vision , tachycardia urinary retention . Moreover , adverse event occur low incidence ( less equal 1.5 % ) also usually mild self-limiting . In abdominal cramping pain associate irritable bowel syndrome , systematic review conflict result regard analgesic efficacy , primarily small sample size less rigorous design . Muller-Krampe et al . conduct prospective cohort 200 child acute chronic abdominal spasm compare effectiveness oral HBB 10 mg homeopathic preparation . HBB demonstrate comparative improvement homeopathic preparation respect pain , sleep disturbance , eat drinking , cry . Over 90 % patient group report good tolerability adverse event . Although HBB use widely abdominal pain child anecdotal evidence suggest efficacious , paediatric clinical trial date explore efficacy ED setting . The investigator hypothesize HBB superior efficacy commonly use agent , acetaminophen acute abdominal pain child . If HBB find effective analgesic child acute abdominal pain , could provide therapeutic option common , painful condition currently little offer .</detailed_description>
