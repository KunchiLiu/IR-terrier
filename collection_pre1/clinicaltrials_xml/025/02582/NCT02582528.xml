	<detailed_description>Individuals identify clinical high risk psychosis ( CHR ) psychosis already evidence cognitive deficit , increase around time conversion . Much less known individual may risk serious mental disorder ( SMI ) . However , early report suggest young people risk SMI deem `` attenuate syndrome '' accord clinical staging model mental health disorder already evidence cognitive deficit . Therefore , cognition excellent treatment target . Furthermore , clear evidence , establish psychiatric disorder schizophrenia , depression bipolar disorder , CHR sample , deficit cognition associate poor functional outcome . Thus , treatment target cognition may consequently improve functional outcome . This pilot project determine feasibility sample size large randomize controlled trial cognitive remediation therapy ( CRT ) people risk SMI CIHR AIHS fund target . The primary aim project test effectiveness novel computerized CRT program improve cognition youth risk SMI follow addition counsel intervention , MI , improve adherence CRT . One group receive CRT CRT plus MI . Hypotheses : 1 . Both study group improvement cognition end treatment ; 2 . CRT+MI group increase treatment adherence superior improvement cognition end treatment 12 month post baseline compare CRT group ; Secondary Hypothesis : 3 . Improved cognition associate improved functional outcome . This longitudinal , single blind , control pilot trial CRT person risk SMI . Twenty-eight participant recruit Adolescent Mental Health : Canadian Psychiatric Risk Outcome Study ( PROCAN ) study Calgary site lead Dr. J. Addington . Participants PROCAN project meet operationally define criterion risk SMI meeting attenuate syndrome criterion include . Participants randomize either CRT condition consist novel program call My Brain Fitness ( MBS ) motivational interviewing ( MI ) control condition consist CRT alone , receive training administer period 10 week . Assessments occur baseline , post treatment ( 3 month ) 12 month baseline . Half participant receive individual 1 hr MI every 2 week duration cognitive remediation component study . The study clinicians master level psychologist , deliver MI ensure engagement study participant . Time spent therapy monitor record . All data necessary study collect part PROCAN assessment baseline 12 month . The one exception assessment cognitive function , clinical symptom functional outcome 10 week immediately post treatment , take approximately 2.5 hour .</detailed_description>
