	<brief_summary>Despite technological advancement direct towards diagnosis peripheral pulmonary lesion , optimal approach yet design . The potential advantage catheter base technique include ability utilize instrument small diameter conventional bronchoscope , thereby allow good access lung periphery . The drawback catheter base approach include relative inability steer conventional catheter , inability perform direct visualization airway inspection conventional catheter . This study evaluate novel steerable catheter system optical capability pair electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy biopsy peripheral pulmonary lesion .</brief_summary>
