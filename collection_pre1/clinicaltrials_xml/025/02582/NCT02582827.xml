	<brief_title>QUILT-3.014 : A Trial ABI-011 Administered Weekly Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors Lymphomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ABI-011 novel , albumin-bound formulation potent thiocolchicine analog , IDN 5404 , mean particle size approximately 100 nanometer ( nm ) . The active drug , IDN 5404 , relate colchicine family tubulin-binding compound find vascular-disrupting activity vivo . Studies ongoing determine whether IDN 5404 vascular-disrupting activity . As dimer , IDN 5404 additional activity inhibitor topoisomerase I , critical enzyme deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) repair mechanism . Although active compound limit solubility , IDN 5404 formulate ABI-011 soluble saline , facilitate IV dose delivery active agent tumor tumor vasculature . The primary objective study CA601.2 determine MTD RP2D ABI-011 administer IV infusion Days 1 , 8 , 15 , follow week rest , patient advance solid tumor malignancy lymphomas . The MTD determine use standard 3+3 design . The secondary objective evaluate safety toxicity profile , evaluate plasma PK ( elimination rate constant , elimination half-life , volume distribution , maximum serum concentration ( Cmax ) , time maximum concentration ( tmax ) , area time-concentration curve time infinity ( AUCinf ) , assess biological activity pharmacodynamics , make preliminary assessment tumor response patient advance solid tumor lymphomas . The exploratory objective determine genomic proteomic profile patient ' tumor identify gene mutation , gene amplification , level protein expression , pinpoint oncoproteins . Correlations genomic/proteomic profile efficacy outcome assess principal metabolite ABI-011 determine , possible . Approximately 45-60 patient treat determine DLTs , MTD , and/or RP2D ABI-011 . Once RP2D identify , expansion cohort ( 10 patient ) occur . Patients cytologically histologically confirm solid tumor malignancy lymphoma curative standard approve therapy available Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ≤ 2 include . In dose-escalation phase study , patient measurable non-measurable disease define Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) , Version 1.1 , criterion . In dose-expansion phase study , patient measurable disease enrol . No anti-cancer therapy ( inclusive investigational therapy ) allow 5 half-lives/4 week ( whichever longer ) prior study drug administration ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) . ABI-011 administered via IV infusion 30 minute weekly Days 1 , 8 , 15 28-Day cycle . The start dose 2 mg/m2 . Patients allow continue treatment experience progressive disease unacceptable toxicity , withdraw consent , physician feel longer best interest continue treatment .</detailed_description>
