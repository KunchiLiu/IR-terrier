	<brief_summary>Endoscopic radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) new palliation therapy malignant bile duct obstruction . It deliver high amount thermal energy target tissue may prolong duration stent patency . RFA show promising result malignant bile duct obstruction increase duration stent patency . The aim study evaluate feasibility safety endoscopic RFA treatment bile duct obstruction , compare efficacy Endoscopic biliary RFA addition self-expanding metal stent ( SEMS ) SEMS alone randomize controlled trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Endoscopic Biliary RFA Malignant Bile Duct Obstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Malignant bile duct obstruction cause many disease arise primary metastatic disease intrahepatic , extrahepatic hilar location . To relieve obstructive decompression jaundice result obstruction , endoscopic stent placement usually require . Compared surgical intervention , stent insertion offer short hospitalization , low overall cost low morbidity . Previous study show superiority SEMSs plastic stent maintain biliary drainage . However , SEMS occlude due epithelial hyperplasia , tumor in-/overgrowth , biofilm deposition sludge formation . Studies show median SEMS patency 120 day . Once bile duct obstruction reoccurs , may lead significant morbidity mortality . Thus , long-term patency SEMS remain unresolved issue . Recently , endoscopic biliary radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) use patient suffer inoperable malignant bile duct obstruction , increase duration stent patency . It deliver high amount thermal energy target tissue curative palliative intent . The purpose study record information evaluate impact radiofrequency ablation improve management cholangiocarcinoma malignant bile duct obstruction , compare effect SEMS plus RFA SEMS alone .</detailed_description>
