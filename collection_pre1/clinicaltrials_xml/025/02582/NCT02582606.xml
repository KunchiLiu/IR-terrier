	<brief_summary>In study investigator compare health effect two different meal pattern . In one , participant consume food accord 'irregular meal pattern ' ( minimum 3 meal , maximum 9 meal per day ) 'regular meal pattern ' ( 6 meal per day ) two week . The energy requirement participant calculate maintain body weight study . Participants provide food consume study . Initially , interested individual attend screen visit complete questionnaires medical health , eat habit physical activity . Height , weight waist circumference measure visit . Thereafter , participant assign 2-week period follow one two meal-patterns . There 2-week period two intervention consume normal diet end , participant undertake next meal pattern . During two phase participant ask wear armband ( detects movement measure heat loss ) , assess energy expenditure interstitial glucose monitoring device wear seven day . Before 2-week intervention , participant come laboratory mixed-meal tolerance test . Blood sample obtain 3hrs eat evaluate health effect meal pattern . Energy expenditure measure ventilated-hood indirect calorimetry armband device . At end 3hr post prandial period , participant offer ad libitum pasta lunch ask eat feel comfortably full . During 2-week period , participant ask record food intake record appetite sensation specific day .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background . Greater variation meal pattern day day might affect energy balance , consequence , control body weight . However , study evaluate impact irregular meal pattern energy metabolism , adult , . Several experimental study Farshchi et al . show potentially important negative health consequence associate erratic/irregular eating pattern . Higher fasting level total-cholesterol low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) -cholesterol , decrease thermic effect food ( TEF ) , reduce insulin sensitivity , observe healthy woman 14 day irregular eating . Subsequent study confirm overweight subject also provide evidence alteration subjective appetite may influence ad-libitum food intake ( Lara et al , unpublished ) . Recently , experimenter show decrease thermogenesis response test meal , great postprandial blood glucose concentration 11 normal weight woman follow two-weeks irregular eat contrast regular pattern . The present study study effect irregular meal pattern obese woman demonstrate fast insulin resistance ( IR ) . Aims : investigate effect meal pattern energy expenditure , postprandial thermogenesis , postprandial blood glucose , fast lipid profile fast insulin sensitivity obese woman insulin resistance . Experimental protocol . 10 woman homeostatic model assessment - insulin resistance ( HOMA-IR ) ≥1.8 , body mass index 28 40 kg/m2 , age 18-45 year , otherwise healthy , recruit . Interested individual initial medical screening confirm suitability . Those recruited ask complete 7 day food diary participating study . The whole study last total 6 week . During first 2 week participant adopt one two meal pattern , follow two-week washout period resume habitual diet meal pattern . A second 2-week intervention follow , alternative meal pattern adopt . The meal pattern 1 ) regular - 6 daily meal snack 2 week , 2 ) irregular - different number ( 3 9 ) meals/snacks every day . Allocation order diet test randomized point recruitment participant number assign sequentially . All food consume weeks1 , 2 , 5 6 provide free charge , comprise food commonly consume British diet , quantity design keep body weight constant study . Participants complete food diary whole study period . They ask wear 'SenseWear ' armband ( SWA ) device ( attach upper arm ) allow physical activity energy expenditure estimate weeks1 , 2 , 5 6 . Participants attend laboratory 6th day intervention phase continuous interstitial glucose monitoring probe insert subcutaneous abdominal fat pad level umbilicus . Participants measure blood glucose four time day , use fingerprick sample pocket glucose analyser , calibrate continuous glucose monitor . After three day participant ask come back device remove . Subjective appetite ( hunger , fullness , etc . ) assess use visual analogue scale ( VAS ) intervention ( end week , whilst glucose monitor worn ) . Before intervention period , participant visit laboratory fasting overnight . At 8:30 cannula insert hand vein , hand place hot-air box , subsequent blood sampling . Indirect calorimetry perform determine energy expenditure , carbohydrate lipid oxidation rate change thermic response milkshake test drink provide 10 kcals/kg body weight , comprise 35 % energy fat , 15 % protein , 50 % carbohydrate . The SWA device also place upper leave arm estimate energy expenditure laboratory visit . Blood sample obtain every 15 minute 3 hour eat . Indirect calorimetry SWA measure concurrently duration laboratory visit . Fasting blood sample use measure total- , high density lipoprotein ( HDL ) - , LDL- , low density lipoprotein ( VLDL ) -cholesterol , triglyceride , glucose insulin . Blood sample obtain test drink also use measure glucose , insulin hormone relate appetite . After 3hr postprandial period , test meal ( pasta ) provide ad-libitum meal participant ask fill VAS ass subjective appetite sensation . Measurable end point study - 24hr Energy expenditure two phase ( irregular versus regular meal pattern ) - Fasting lipid , insulin , glucose glucose profile continuous monitor - Insulin , glucose gut hormone ( Glucagon-Like Peptide 1 , Ghrelin Peptide YY ) responses test drink - Postprandial thermogenic response test drink - Ratings subjective appetite study Sample size statistical power Using 1 sample t-test model , power calculate level 0.8 . Primary end point = difference thermic effect food 'TEF ' ( kcal/min ) 180min . Results obtain study previous study indicate incremental area TEF curve regular eat 25.8 ( SD 6.8 ) kcal irregular eat 14.8 ( SD 11.7 ) kcal . With cross-over design , 10 subject group would able detect change TEF power 80 % level 0.05 significance .</detailed_description>
