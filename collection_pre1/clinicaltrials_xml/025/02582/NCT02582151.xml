	<brief_summary>Neurogenic bladder patient may symptoms urinary frequency , urgency , urgency incontinence voiding symptom due bladder dysfunction arise underlie neurologic condition . Current treatment option effective patient , however many patient optimally manage due modest efficacy significant side effect . Second line therapy include intravesical onabotulinum toxin , however associate risk urinary retention , patient neurologic disorder often unable perform self catheterize due physical limitation . Sacral neuromodulation associate undesirably high cost potential complication population . The use transcutaneous tibial nerve stimulation alternative form neuromodulation , may potential benefit percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation . While preliminary study suggest may effective , high quality randomize trial . This proposal 3 month , randomize , sham-controlled , clinical trial evaluate short term clinical efficacy home transcutaneous tibial nerve stimulation . Valid reliable patient report outcome measure , objective measure incontinence include outcome .</brief_summary>
