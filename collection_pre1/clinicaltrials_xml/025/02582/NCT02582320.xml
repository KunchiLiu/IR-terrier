	<brief_title>Clinical-biological Characteristics Outcome Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Under Ibrutinib-named Patient Program</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) common leukemia adult . The disease characterize progressive accumulation phenotypically mature malignant B lymphocytes , primarily peripheral blood , bone marrow , lymph node . Over last 10-15 year several biological prognostic marker identify , start immunoglobulin gene mutational analysis CD38 , ZAP70 , CD49d expression , many others . The recent discovery several new gene carry point mutation CLL , include NOTCH1 , SF3B1 BIRC3 , add marker seem correlate resistance treatment transformation Richter syndrome . A large number chemoimmunotherapy regimens currently consider treatment CLL patient . NPP program The Named Patient Program ( NPP ) program intend provide early access ibrutinib Italy . This program specifically patient relapse refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia ( CLL ) /small lymphocytic lymphoma ( SLL ) , mantle cell lymphoma . Rationale In patient CLL Ibrutinib , give single agent show marked activity good safety profile . Data patient treat ibrutinib outside controlled clinical trial within National Patient Program ( NPP ) could give additional information clinical use , treatment duration , efficacy , toxicity ibrutinib give CLL patient real life context .</detailed_description>
