	<brief_summary>There increase evidence effectiveness allergy immunotherapy control symptom rhinoconjunctivitis related cumulative dose allergen allergoid administer single regimen subcutaneous ( SC ) injection sublingual administration . The current therapeutic dose regimen Grass MATA MPL course four injection 300 , 800 , 2000 2000 SU ( Standardized Units ) , administer weekly interval ( cumulative dose 5100 SU ) . Two new cumulative dos Grass MATA MPL 10200 SU 18200 SU develop compare current dose . The study design explore benefit/risk increase cumulative allergen dose Grass MATA MPL immunotherapy compare dos current dose Grass MATA MPL , Grass MATA ( without MPL ) placebo .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study conduct outside grass pollen season comprise five period . - Period 1 : Screening visit - Period 2 : Eligibility baseline symptom assessment mobile environmental exposure chamber ( mEEC™ ) - Period 3 : Six treatment visit , study drug inject - Period 4 : Post-treatment efficacy assessment mEEC™ - Period 5 : Safety follow-up Period 1 screen visit ( Visit 1 ) , occur 3 28 day Visit 2 . Period 2 include pre-randomization , grass pollen exposure visit , consist four 3 hour session mEEC™ ( Visits 2 , 3 , 4 5 ) patient exposed grass pollen record nasal non nasal symptom use electronic diary ( electronic Patient Data Acquisition Tablet : ePDAT™ ) prior entry every 30 minute post entry mEEC™ . Patients attend mEEC™ visit consecutive day . To eligible randomization proceed Treatment ( Period 3 ) , patient must achieve follow final pre treatment mEEC™ ( Visit 5 ) : - Minimum qualifying Total Symptom Score ( TSS ) least 12 possible 24 least one exposure use ePDAT™ - Total Nasal Symptom Score ( TNSS ) least 7 possible 12 use ePDAT™ - Runny nose score least 2 3 least two time point . Period 3 include six treatment visit ( Visit 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 11 ) . After injection , patient keep observation personnel qualify manage systemic allergic reaction site least 30 minute . This period extend investigator response injection site systemic allergic reaction . The observation follow telephone call approximately 24 hour later . Period 4 consists four 3 hour session ( Visits 12 , 13 , 14 15 ) mEEC™ patient expose grass pollen record post-treatment TSSs use ePDAT™ Period 2 . Period 5 consists End Study ( EOS ) safety follow-up visit ( Visit 16 ) 2 14 day last EEC visit . A telephone follow-up make approximately 3 , 6 , 12 month follow last injection detail enquiry regard expect non-expected AEs , special attention New Onset Autoimmune Disorders ( NOAD ) Neuro-inflammatory ( NI ) disease . For subject withdraw early , similar follow do approximately 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 month follow last injection .</detailed_description>
