	<brief_title>Multicomponent Intervention Physical Frailty Sarcopenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As life expectancy European country continue increase , maintenance physical independence old person become major public health priority . The ability ambulate without assistance crucial independent living often first ability lose process lead disability . Older people impair walk function need assistance likely place nursing home , high risk morbidity , mortality hospitalisation , experience reduce quality life . The ultimate goal Sarcopenia Physical fRailty IN old people : multicomponenT Treatment strategy ( SPRINTT ) project offer efficient treatment option , base multicomponent intervention include physical activity , nutrition information communication technology , physically frail , sarcopenic old person improve quality life . The result directly contribute long-term sustainability efficiency health- social-care system . The conceptualisation physical frailty sarcopenia ( PF &amp; S ) propose SPRINTT promote significant advancement traditional approach enable precise operationalisation condition , clear identification affect population rapid translation finding clinical arena .</detailed_description>
