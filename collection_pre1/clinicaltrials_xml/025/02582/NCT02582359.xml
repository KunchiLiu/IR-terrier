	<brief_title>MLN 9708 Induction Consolidation Adults With AML &gt; = 60 Years Age</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study clinical trial comprise two Phase I portion induction treatment ( initial treatment ) , consolidation treatment ( give later ) . The patient ask participate one phase I portion study . A phase I study test safety investigational drug combination drug . Phase I study also try define appropriate dose investigational drug use study . `` Investigational '' mean drug combination study . It also mean FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve drug combination participant 's type cancer . In research study , investigator study safety tolerability MLN9708 combination standard treatment adult 60 year age old AML . In first phase I portion treatment ( `` induction '' ) participant receive MLN9708 combination daunorubicin cytarabine . Once maximally tolerate dose ( MTD ) MLN9708 establish induction portion , 36 additional participant enrol portion focus consolidation . The drug daunorubicin cytarabine approve FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) . MLN9708 approve FDA .</detailed_description>
