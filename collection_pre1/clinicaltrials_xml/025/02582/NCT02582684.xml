	<brief_summary>This study do see combination two anti-HIV medicine , dolutegravir ( DTG , Tivicay ) lamivudine ( 3TC , Epivir ) take day , provide safe , effective , well-tolerated treatment HIV . DTG type HIV medicine call integrase inhibitor ; 3TC type HIV medicine call reverse transcriptase inhibitor . DTG work block integrase 3TC work block reverse transcriptase , two HIV protein ( enzyme ) . This prevent HIV multiply lower viral load ( amount HIV blood ) . Both DTG 3TC currently part Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) recommend regimen along third active drug . Since HIV medicine side effect costly , interest whether HIV successfully control few three HIV drug .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>HIV1 infection , document licensed rapid HIV test HIV enzyme chemiluminescence immunoassay ( E/CIA ) test kit time prior study entry confirm licensed Western blot second antibody test method initial rapid HIV and/or E/CIA , HIV1 antigen , plasma HIV1 RNA viral load . NOTE : The term `` license '' refers US FDAapproved kit , require IND study . WHO CDC ( Centers Disease Control Prevention ) guideline mandate confirmation initial test result must use test different one use initial assessment . A reactive initial rapid test confirm either another type rapid assay E/CIA base different antigen preparation and/or different test principle ( e.g. , indirect versus competitive ) , Western blot plasma HIV1 RNA viral load . Plasma HIV1 RNA ≥1000 copies/mL &lt; 500,000 copies/mL obtain within 90 day prior study entry use FDAapproved assay US laboratory CLIA certification equivalent . No evidence RT , integrase , major protease resistance mutation ( accord 2014 IASUSA drug resistance mutation list , available http : //www.iasusa.org/sites/default/files/tam/223642.pdf ) base preARV treatment genotype perform time prior study entry . NOTE : Integrase genotyping must perform screen provide study . RT PR genotyping perform screen part routine clinical care previously perform . ARV treatment drugnaive ( define previous ARV treatment time prior study entry , exception successful postexposure prophylaxis ( PEP ) preexposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) . NOTE : Participants diagnose HIV PrEP within year PrEP ( unless document seronegative interim ) eligible . The following laboratory value obtain within 45 day prior study entry US laboratory CLIA certification equivalent : ANC ≥750/mm3 Hemoglobin ≥10.0 g/dL Platelets ≥ 50,000/mm3 Calculated creatinine clearance ( CrCl ) ≥50 mL/min , estimate CockcroftGault equation AST &lt; 5 x ULN ( upper limit normal ) ALT &lt; 5x ULN Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN Hepatitis B surface antigen negative within 45 day prior study entry perform CLIAcertified laboratory . For woman reproductive potential , negative serum urine pregnancy test screening within 48 hour prior study entry ( US clinic laboratory CLIA certification equivalent , use point care ( POC ) /CLIAwaived test ) . Reproductive potential define woman postmenopausal least 24 consecutive month , i.e. , menses within precede 24 month , undergone surgical sterilization ( e.g. , hysterectomy , bilateral oophorectomy , salpingectomy , tubal ligation tubal microinserts ) . The urine test must sensitivity ≤50 mIU/mL . NOTE : Women report 12 month amenorrhea folliclestimulating hormone ( FSH ) level menopausal range consider NOT reproductive potential . If participate sexual activity could lead pregnancy , female participant reproductive potential must use one form contraceptive list receive protocolspecified medication 30 day stop medication . At least one follow method must use appropriately : 1 . Condoms ( male female ) without spermicidal agent . Condoms recommend appropriate use contraception method effective prevent HIV transmission . NOTE : In set condom failure , emergency contraception ( plan B ) appropriate backup method contraception . 2 . Diaphragm cervical cap spermicide . 3 . Intrauterine device . 4 . Hormonebased contraceptive . Ability willingness participant legal representative provide inform consent . Serious illness require systemic treatment and/or hospitalization NOTE : Participant eligible participant complete therapy 7 day prior study entry clinically stable therapy opinion site investigator 7 day prior study entry . NOTE : Participants oral candidiasis , vaginal candidiasis , mucocutaneous herpes simplex , minor illness ( judge site investigator ) eligible . Treatment within 30 day prior study entry immune modulators systemic steroid , interleukin , interferon , granulocyte colonystimulating factor ( GCSF ) , erythropoietin , investigational therapy . NOTE : Participants receive stable physiologic glucocorticoid dos ( define prednisone ≤15 mg/day equivalent stable taper dose ) eligible . Participants receive corticosteroid acute therapy PCP asthma exacerbation , receive short course ( defined ≤2 week pharmacologic glucocorticoid therapy ) eligible . Pregnancy breastfeed . The following prohibited participant study drug : Systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy NOTE : Topical 5FU treatment human papilloma virus disease allow . Dofetilide prohibit DTG DTG may inhibit renal tubular secretion result increase dofetilide concentration potential toxicity . There prohibited medication 3TC Known allergy/sensitivity study drug formulation . Active drug alcohol use dependence may interfere adherence study requirement , opinion site investigator . Active hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) treatment anticipated need treatment within study period . NOTE : HCV infection alone exclusionary . Unstable liver disease ( define presence ascites , encephalopathy , coagulopathy , hypoalbuminemia , esophageal gastric varix , persistent jaundice ) , know biliary abnormality ( exception Gilbert 's syndrome asymptomatic gallstone ) . Severe hepatic impairment ( Class C ) determine ChildPugh classification .</criteria>
