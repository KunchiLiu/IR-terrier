	<brief_title>Resident-Performed Laser-Assisted v Manual Traditional Phacoemulsification Cataract Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study design prospective study compare laser-assisted cataract extraction case traditional manual phacoemulsification case . All case perform faculty-supervised resident Parkland Memorial Hospital . Cataract surgery train standard requirement ophthalmology resident part clinical study . Each resident must post graduate year 4 ( PGY-4 ) level resident ask part clinical study . Typically , resident complete approximately 30 cataract surgery PGY-3 residency year training . These traditional phacoemulsification require manual capsulorrhexis creation resident experience prior study participation . Other critical manual surgical step traditional femtosecond-laser assist cataract surgery require similar surgical skill set , thus resident surgical skill applicable technique prior study involvement . In addition perform 30 traditional phacoemulsification surgery , resident also assist femtosecond laser-assisted case PGY-3 training year training Dallas VA medical center staff University Texas ( UT ) Southwestern Medical Center cornea rotation . The femtosecond-assisted case complete resident study Parkland Alcon Certification case resident . Performing femtosecond-laser assisted case level train provide objective insight new surgical technique resident hand . Patients subject additional risk due participation study femtosecond laser Alcon Certification already perform resident part standard UT Southwestern ophthalmology training . Patient eye meet inclusion exclusion criterion randomly assign either laser-assisted standard manual phacoemulsification group base . Following surgery , patient return post-operative visit post-op day 1 , post-op week 1 , post-op month 1 , post-op month 3 . Subjects follow Parkland Surgery Chief clinic . Subjects necessarily see study surgeon post-operative visit period . It note standard procedure currently practice Parkland ophthalmology clinic . Verification subject adherence post-operative follow-up visit schedule overseen PI throughout course project . Weekly communication sub-investigators take place order review outstanding concern include recruitment effort , surgery schedule , post-operative visit timeline . Arrangements additional visit also review schedule medically necessary depend individual patient ' post-operative clinical course . Patients assign group period September 2015 July 2016 follow part study 3 month post-operatively . Patients offer kerato-refractive procedure include manual limbal relaxing incision LenSx astigmatic keratotomy would offer patient part study . Patients also evaluate benefit advanced technology intraocular lens ( Toric astigmatism ReStor multifocal ) patient part study would offer . Offering advanced technology lens combine kerato-refractive procedure expect influence visual acuity study outcomes patient study . Patient 's clinical history , past medical history ophthalmic medical note ( particular pre-operative evaluation , operative , post-operative follow ) review . De-identified data point extract project .</detailed_description>
