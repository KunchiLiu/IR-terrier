	<brief_summary>The incidence HIV/AIDS among African American men sex men ( MSM ) alarming , public health response urgent situation hamper lack sexual risk reduction intervention solid evidence efficacy population . Accordingly , broad , long-term objective propose research identify intervention reduce risk sexually transmit infection ( STI ) among African American MSM . This application seek fund develop test efficacy theory-based , contextually appropriate behavioral intervention reduce sexual risk behavior among African American MSM . Intervention development guide social cognitive theory , theory plan behavior , qualitative information focus group , finding longitudinal survey men study population . A one-on-one intervention utilized address specific prevention need man allay participant ' concern reveal sexual involvement men virtue participate group workshop intervention . The study utilize randomize controlled trial design , baseline , immediate post intervention , 6 12 month post intervention assessment . The participant African American MSM randomize one-on-one sexual risk reduction intervention one-on-one health promotion intervention serve control condition . The primary outcome consistent condom use anal vaginal intercourse . The study test whether intervention increase consistent use condom anal intercourse , primary outcome , whether decrease sexual risk behavior , whether social cognitive theory variable mediate effect intervention consistent condom use . This study provide urgently need intervention reduce risk HIV STIs one high risk population United States .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>HIV/AIDS devastate impact African American MSM . Although African Americans represent 13 % US population , 49 % AIDS diagnose 2004 African Americans . That HIV/AIDS take increase toll African American injection drug user heterosexual last decade well document . Nevertheless , MSM continue account large number African Americans HIV/AIDS . Through 2004 , MSM exposure category account 37 % cumulative AIDS case African American men , whereas injection drug use account 31 % heterosexual transmission account 10 % . Consonant figure HIV/AIDS case , HIV infection rate several study Centers Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ) conduct African American MSM rival find many sub-Saharan African nation . For instance , CDC 5-city study find African American MSM test HIV , two-thirds unaware status 46 % HIV positive . Similarly , 7-city CDC Young Men 's Survey find HIV prevalence rate 32 % African American MSM . Interestingly , although African American MSM relatively high HIV infection rate , evidence suggest engage risky sexual practice MSM . This may mean African American MSM draw sexual partner pool people HIV prevalence relatively high , underscores urgency target intervention population . Quite apart risk HIV , African American MSM high risk STIs . The CDC MSM Prevalence Monitoring Project conduct 9 US city , 1999 2004 find rate gonorrhea chlamydia high MSM , especially high African American MSM . In 2004 , urethral gonorrhea positivity 16 % African Americans , compare 11 % Whites , 9 % Hispanics . The median urethral chlamydia positivity 6 % overall , 9 % African Americans . To curb HIV epidemic high rate STIs African American MSM , prevention effort must urgently undertake . Although several researcher stress need culturally appropriate prevention intervention target African American MSM , scant progress make toward identification intervention . Ample evidence indicate theory-based intervention decrease sexual risk behavior among MSM . A meta-analysis 40 controlled study HIV prevention behavioral intervention MSM find intervention reduce amount report unprotected sex much 27 % , reveal MSM population high risk , include African American MSM , underserved intervention research . Consider , example , Project EXPLORE , large-scale multi-site control trial ( RCT ) enrol 4,200 MSM follow 4 year . Fewer 7 % participant African American , eligible African Americans less likely enroll trial eligible Whites , African Americans likely drop . Another meta-analysis find , 33 HIV sexual risk reduction intervention trial MSM , 6 employed sample least 10 % African American . The insufficient number rigorous intervention trial direct African American MSM hinder ability make definitive conclusion combat men 's attitude beliefs concern sexual risk behavior ultimately determine effectiveness HIV prevention strategy target African American MSM . Reaching African American MSM may particularly challenge many African American MSM use traditional resource organization serve gay men identify White gay culture . In addition , African American MSM may also difficult reach within African American community often closet isolated due real perceive homophobia . That isolation , turn , contribute internalized repression gay sexual identity , may isolate resource available gay men . The investigator ' approach address problem reach African American MSM develop intervention use community-based organization ( CBOs ) already serve African American MSM . The investigator create Community Advisory Board include representative CBOs serve African American MSM representative study population advise intervention design aspects trial . In addition , investigator hold focus group representative CBOs serve African Americans frequently consult regard approach . Reviews literature suggest 3 basic approach design HIV/STI risk reduction program aim MSM . One approach seek reduce risk implementation small group workshop intervention . The second approach use community-level intervention . A third approach individual one-on-one intervention . All three approach merit reduce risk behavior among men control trial . An advantage one-on-one avoids problem men risk reveal sex men order participate prevention program . There added benefit one-on-one approach . It permit tailor intervention specific need man . A recent meta-analysis identify characteristic effective HIV behavioral intervention MSM . Efficacy associate intervention one session , duration 4 hour , time span least 3 week . The Proposed Randomized Controlled Trial ( RCT ) This study test efficacy Being Responsible Ourselves ( BRO ) HIV Risk Reduction Intervention increase condom use reduce sexual risk behavior among African American MSM Philadelphia , African Americans account 70 % report case AIDS June 2005 . The study use RCT design , scientifically sound method assess causal impact intervention . An attention-matched control group , Health Promotion Intervention , provide control Hawthorne effect special attention . Computer-generated random number sequence use randomly assign participant intervention arm use concealment allocation technique design minimize bias assignment . The biostatistician generate random assignment ; project director implement assignment . The study also examine theoretical variable intervention design affect , permit mediation analysis address intervention efficacious efficacious . This study , , provide urgently need intervention help curb alarmingly high incidence HIV urban , African American community . The BRO HIV Risk Reduction Intervention Health Promotion Intervention develop base social cognitive theory reason action approach , integrate extensive formative research , include focus group pilot test . Most relevant social-cognitive-theory construct `` outcome expectancy , '' belief consequence specific behavior , `` self-efficacy , '' people 's confidence execute specific behavior ; emphasis behavioral skill ; method increase skill , particularly practice performance feedback ( e.g. , role-playing ) . The reasoned action approach extension theory plan behavior , extension theory reason action . Most relevant reason action approach 's emphasis importance salient belief , notion belief may vary population population behavior behavior , method identify population-specific belief : namely , use qualitative research , include focus group . By identify target population 's salient belief , intervention change belief result change target behavior . The investigator utilize one-on-one intervention allay concern African American MSM might reveal sexual behavior men virtue participate group-based intervention , concern express focus group African American MSM representative CBOs serve African American MSM . Consistent reason action approach , investigator conduct qualitative research , include 7 focus group African American MSM 1 representative CBOs serve African American MSM , ensure intervention tailor population . In addition , investigator conduct 3 pilot test intervention . The BRO HIV/STI risk-reduction intervention design strengthen outcome expectancy express focus group African American MSM , outcome expectancy observe population , include hedonistic outcome expectancy use condom would interfere sexual enjoyment , prevention outcome expectancy use condom prevents STIs , include HIV , self-evaluative outcome expectancy use condom would make man feel good . The intervention design address aspect self-efficacy identified focus group , include technical-skill self-efficacy use condom correctly without interfere sexual enjoyment , impulse-control self-efficacy exercise necessary control use condom even sexually excite , influence alcohol drug , presence trigger unsafe sex , skills self-efficacy negotiate condom use sexual partner . In addition , design increase knowledge regard risk acquire transmit HIV STIs , perceive vulnerability HIV infection re-infection different strain HIV . Summary In summary , African Americans disproportionately affected HIV epidemic . The prevalence HIV infection among African American MSM alarmingly high , parallel rate observed country sub-Saharan Africa . For condoms prevent transmission HIV/AIDS , must use correctly consistently . Behavioral intervention find effective reduce rate sexual risk behavior , conduct African American MSM . This research seek answer call culturally appropriate intervention high-risk subgroup MSM . The primary hypothesis BRO HIV Risk Reduction Intervention increase consistent use condom decrease sexual risk behavior compare control group intervention 's effect condom use mediate variable social cognitive theory reason action approach .</detailed_description>
