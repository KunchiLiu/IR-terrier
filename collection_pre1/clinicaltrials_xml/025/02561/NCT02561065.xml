	<detailed_description>We study effectiveness 30-month worksite-based lifestyle program aim promote cardiovascular health participant high low degree subclinical atherosclerotic plaque burden ( SAPB ) , compare standard care . Methods : We conduct randomize controlled trial ( RCT ) include middle-aged bank employee ´Progression Early Subclinical Atherosclerosis´ ( PESA ) cohort , stratify SAPB . Within stratum , participant randomize 1:1 receive lifestyle program standard care . The primary outcome measure adapt FUSTER-BEWAT CVD risk lifestyle composite score secondary outcome measure include physical activity , sedentary time , stand time , diet , smoking , anthropometric measure , blood biomarkers , self-rated health , work-related outcome , healthcare consumption , program process measure cost measure .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Employees age 40 60 year PESA ( Progression Early Subclinical Atherosclerosis ) cohort study ( 48 ) Banco de Santander Headquarters Madrid ( Spain ) . 2 . Employees include need 1 year PESA 2/3 visit ( 1/ +2 month deviation ) . 3 . Employees stratify high low degree imaging define SAPB . High degree imagingdefined SAPB define high burden atherosclerotic disease detect either 2D ultrasound ( upper tertile sum maximum thickness plaque coronary artery calcium score ( CACS ) compute tomography ≥ 1 point ) . Low degree imagingdefined SAPB define CACS Agatston score zero plaque 2D ultrasound low two tertiles plaque burden . Participants without plaque burden BMI ≥ 25 , ; report least one unhealthy lifestyle behavior last PESA visit ( i.e. , &lt; 150 min/wk least moderate intensity physical activity assess accelerometer , sit &gt; 7 h/d assess accelerometer , meet Mediterranean diet guideline assess computerized dietary history tool previously develop validate EPICSpain study improve ENRICA investigator , smoke ) also include low SAPB group . 1 . Prior history cardiovascular disease ( myocardial infarction , angina pectoris , stroke , peripheral vascular disease , aortic aneurysm , angioplasty , heart surgery , atrial fibrillation , heart disease ) . 2 . Active treatment cancer , history transplant active immunosuppressive immunomodulator treatment . 3 . Morbid obesity ( body mass index ≥40 kg/m2 ) . 4 . Presence disease decrease life expectancy 3 year , condition could affect adherence study procedure . 5 . Participants also exclude pregnant lactating woman . 6 . Employees without plaque burden , healthy BMI healthy lifestyle exclude RCT .</criteria>
