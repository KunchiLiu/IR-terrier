	<brief_summary>Rationale : Subjects metabolic syndrome increase risk develop cardiovascular disease twofold risk develop hypertension . A functional food ingredient ability improve arterial stiffness , microcirculation and/or ability reduce blood pressure could potentially contribute delay prevention range cardiovascular disease could provide additional complimentary alternative pharmacological lifestyle base intervention maintenance cardiovascular health . Objective : To assess acute ( 2h ) short term ( 2 day 4 week ) effect daily administration 5g NWT03 ( egg-protein hydrolysate ) carotid-radial Pulse Wave Velocity ( cr-PWV ) . Secondary objective assess effect carotid-femoral PWV , characteristic microcirculation , systolic diastolic blood pressure , lipid lipoprotein metabolism , glucose metabolism incretins . Study design : Investigators propose carry randomize , double-blind , placebo control crossover study . Study population : Eligible subject male female , non-smokers 18-75 year age otherwise healthy , meet least three criterion Metabolic Syndrome ( MetS ) . It estimate 80 otherwise healthy subject MetS randomise , result minimum 72 evaluable subject ( drop maximal 10 % ) end study . Intervention : Subjects randomly allocate receive 5g NWT-03 placebo , daily , separate occasion , period 4 week washout period two intervention typically 4 week . However , period may shorten 2 week extend 8 week , depend availability subject . Total study duration 10 - 16 week , depend duration washout period . Main study parameters/endpoints : Measurements perform start end 4-week intervention period . Effects NWT-03 supplementation calculate absolute difference value obtain period . The main study endpoint change cr-PWV . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : Before study start , subject screen determine eligibility screen visit . During visit , body weight , height , waist circumference blood pressure measure venous blood sample ( 10 mL ) collect . During study , subject receive NWT-03 placebo powder random order ask consume daily basis . At visit 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 7 ( day 0 , 2 , 27 , 56 , 58 83 study ) , cr-PWV , cf-PWV office blood pressure record . A fundus photograph blood sample ( 20mL ) take fasting condition . 2 hour intake designate study product cr-PWV , cf-PWV office blood pressure measure another fundus photograph take . Additionally , blood sample ( 20 mL ) collect . Thus , total 270 mL blood drawn . A pregnancy test take female childbearing potential visit 2 5 . Subjects ask fill food frequency questionnaire provide spot urine sample visit 4 7 . Furthermore , subject ask keep study diary throughout duration study . Total time investment subject approximately 19 hour . Apart bruise hematoma , rarely induced blood sampling , risk associate participation study .</brief_summary>
