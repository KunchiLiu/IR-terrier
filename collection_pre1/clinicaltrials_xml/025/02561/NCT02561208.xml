	<detailed_description>Description problem study rationale Cervical cancer remain serious health problem , particularly develop country . In Argentina , every year 5,000 woman diagnose cervical cancer 1,800 die disease 1 . In several Latin American country , lead cause cancer death among woman mainly affect woman low socioeconomic status . This due part difficulty health policy promote woman 's participation prevention program , namely access screen , follow-up treatment precancerous lesion . Proof causal link HPV cervical cancer allow recent development HPV-based screening test , detect HPV type consider high-risk . These test important advantage Pap screen test : high sensitivity ( 90 % ) 2 high negative predictive value3 , allow reduction screening frequency well identification HPV positive woman , even without present precancerous lesion , constitute high-risk group require special follow-up within health system . Very importantly , self-collection , HPV-testing reduce barrier screen increase coverage.4 The method highly accurate5,6 , acceptable woman different countries.7-10 Argentina become pioneer introduction new technology HPV-based cervical cancer prevention . The National Ministry Health approve incorporation test nation-wide screening method . In context PI conduct Jujuy Demonstration Project ( JDP ) introduce HPV-testing primary screening.11 This project part national strategy strengthen cervical cancer screen re-launched 2008,12 also include introduction HPV vaccination 2011.13 The JDP four-year implementation project ( 2011-2014 ) develop , implement evaluate programmatic component HPV-based screen strategy11 . In addition , 2012 PI conduct population-based cluster randomize trial ( Self-collection Modality Trial , initial EMA Spanish ) . The study first carry programmatic , real-world context low-resource region main objective ass effect women´s screen uptake HPV self-collection offer CHWs home visit assess self-test acceptability woman CHWs . Our intervention result four-fold increase screen uptake ( 85.9 % vs 20.2 % ) , show offer HPV self-collection home visit CHWs effective strategy improve cervical screening coverage10 . However , screen program , high coverage result decrease disease burden woman diagnosed/treated . Several triage method available include cytology , visual inspection method , colposcopy . In Argentina , cytology use triage method ; therefore , HPV-positive woman perform self—collection home need attend health center undergo cytology . However , proportion woman complete triage low ; therefore new innovative strategy need increase attendance cytology woman . The aim study evaluate effectiveness mHealth intervention versus usual care increase adherence cytological triage woman HPV-positive self-collected test . Setting study The province Jujuy select develop study due fact screen base HPV test primary test introduce 2011 . The province Jujuy high mortality rate ( 11.8 x 100.000 woman 2008-2011 three-year period ) one provinces set priority National Program Cervical Cancer Prevention . Since 2011 , HPV-testing primary screen test , available woman age ≥30 attend public health center since 2014 HPV- self-collection introduce programmatic strategy screen under-users . The Primary Health Care System ( PHC ) integrate approximately 700 pay full-time CHWs twice yearly visit approximately 110.000 household health-related task immunization promotion maternal/child health . CHW performance evaluate annually score good sub-optimal PHC supervisor accord achievement establish goal ( e.g . number home visit ) .10 One hundred percent screening , follow treatment public health system register SITAM . SITAM national online information system register screening/diagnosis/treatment event woman attend public health system.14 Goals study A cluster randomize trial conduct ; include total number 240 Community Health Workers ( CHWs ) 7200 woman . The aim study : 1 . To evaluate effectiveness mhealth intervention versus usual care increase adherence cytological triage among woman HPV-positive self-collected test . 2 . To assess intervention acceptability woman CHWs . Cluster randomize trial An overall number 240 CHWs Primary Health Care System ( PHCS ) Province Jujuy randomize two group name mHealth-Intervention Group ( MH ) Usual Care Group ( UC ) 1. mHealth Intervention Group : Women HPV self-collected test receive mixed intervention include counsel interactive Apps specifically devise increase adherence triage run tablet , SMS text message ( SMS message ) remind attend triage . In addition , Heads CHWs , chiefs gynecology service CHWs receive reminder via e-mails contact woman 60 day HPV-results HPV+ perform triage . 2 . Usual Care Group : Women HPV self-collected test receive usual care . 1 . Procedures carry group : • mHealth intervention Group : During home visit CHWs carry health round , select CHWs visit every household charge contact woman age 30+ offer HPV self-collection accord programmatic guideline . Those woman accept self-collection invited participate study , provide necessary information goal activity involve . Eligible woman willing participate study invite sign inform consent . The CHW update F883 template , standard primary health care form use CHWs collect socio-demographic health data household member . CHWs use specific questionnaire collect basic data inclusion/exclusion criterion . Then CHWs use APPs specifically design project , run tablet , provide woman information mean test result , next step follow positive negative result , importance adherence triage diagnostic/treatment procedure need . An automated system delivery SMS message develop link SITAM . Once test sample process HPV laboratory result register SITAM , woman receive SMS message ask send confirmatory reply text message include national ID number . Once confirmatory reply receive system , woman receive second SMS message inform result available health center , date time receive . Seven day first text message , HPV+ woman receive reminder collect test result health center . The message ask woman disregard message case already go health center get result . Sixty-days first SMS message , Heads CHWs , chiefs gynecology service CHWs receive e-mail SMS message inform HPV+ woman triaged cytology , ask contact specific woman , information name address . • Usual care group : During home visit CHWs carry health round , select CHWs visit every household charge contact woman age 30+ offer HPV self-collection accord programmatic guideline . Those woman accept self-collection invited participate study , provide necessary information goal activity involve . Eligible woman willing participate study invite sign inform consent . The CHW update F883 template , standard primary health care form use CHWs collect socio-demographic health data household member . CHWs use specific questionnaire collect basic data inclusion/exclusion criterion . HPV-positive woman receive visit CHW inform go health center receive result , follow standard practice provincial protocol guideline . 2 . Training CHWs : All CHWs province Jujuy inform study special training provide select participate study . During training session , goal study , main activity carry specific task one perform explain . 1 . Sample selection size A total 240 CHWs , work province , stratify four group accord gender urban/rural setting . A stratified sample 240 CHWs randomly select proportional allocation stratum . Within stratum , CHWs randomly assign ( 1:1 ) study group . All select CHWs inform study PHC head . We produce computer-generated random number list CHW random selection intervention allocation . Blinding intervention outcome assessment feasible . The study design power 0·9 detect 20·0 % increase triage intervention group compare 30·0 % triage control group ( two-sided alpha=0·05 ) . Based PHC records13 estimate CHWs would enroll average 30 woman six month , 4 positive . Correlation induce CHWs include sample size calculation assume intra-class correlation coefficient 0·10 , result sample 120 CHWs per arm , total approximately 7200 woman enrol . 2 . Database : A database build specifically study use ; include data randomization Group , agreement participate study socio-demographic data . Data HPV-testing triage upload import data SITAM , use Unique Identification Number ( DNI ) . Data entry do specific software include range inter-item consistency check . Entries expect range allow . Data entry do 3 data enters , re-entry 20 % questionnaire quality control . Data store file ( TXT , DBF , SQL ) compatible analysis statistical package ( Stata ) . The data cleaning process actively search error plan way . Data screen include search four type oddity : outlier ( include inconsistency ) , strange pattern distribution , unexpected analysis result . Screening method include browse data table sort , printout variable pass consistency check , graphical exploration distribution , frequency distribution cross-tabulations summary statistic . Once error identify , go previous stage data flow see whether value consistently . If error find data entry phase , question interviewer may happen . If possible , contact interviewee repeat measurement . Accuracy previous HPV test report woman cross information laboratory database ( SITAM ) . Those woman report previous HPV test , test SITAM data base exclude study . Plan miss data Data exhaustive complete sample arrive HPV laboratory . Because define outcome number Pap smear effectively record laboratory database ( SITAM ) / number woman study arm , expect miss data main outcome . 3 . Data analysis : Data analysis do specific commercial software ( STATA 10.0 SPSS 15.0 ) . Effectiveness enhance woman adherence cytological triage Adherence triage consider CHW . This defined number woman triage smear within 30 , 60 90 day . There comparison percentage HPV-positive woman Pap test within time interval mHealth intervention group Usual Care group . The effect mHealth intervention usual care estimate use mean difference test non-parametric test independent sample .</detailed_description>
