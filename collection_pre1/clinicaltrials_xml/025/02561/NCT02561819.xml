	<brief_title>Measurement Body Composition Air Displacement Plethysmography Pediatric Intestinal Failure Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Infants child intestinal failure ( IF ) require prolonged period parenteral nutrition ( PN ) sustenance growth intestinal adaptation allow adequate enteral intake . Lean body mass ( muscle mass ) preservation accrual important goal phase nutritional rehabilitation . However , lean body mass accurately measure currently available anthropometric technique . Thus , despite weight gain , muscle mass depletion remain undetected . Little data exist field measure body composition patient intestinal failure , change body weight commonly take indirectly measure gastrointestinal absorptive function . Body composition analysis particular importance management patient , since help guide medical , surgical and/or nutrition intervention , include titration enteral parenteral nutrition . To investigator ' knowledge study examine whether air-displacement plethysmography ( ADP ) valid measure body composition patient intestinal failure . The investigator propose non-randomized , prospective cohort study validate ADP measure body composition infant child IF . The investigator apply non-radioactive ( stable ) isotope technique examine accuracy ADP measure body composition child . The investigator also compare ADP bioimpedance analysis routine anthropometry . Additionally , subject recent dual-energy X- ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) scan , investigator compare ADP estimate body composition obtain DXA . The investigator hypothesize ADP feasible accurate technique body composition measurement , device use serially measure lean body mass fat mass change cohort . If feasibility accuracy ADP body composition analysis demonstrate , technique likely wider application pediatric illness .</detailed_description>
