	<brief_summary>This open-label study ass safety , tolerability efficacy olaparib combination carboplatin . There two part study : Part A , dose escalation patient advance Human Epidermal Growth Factor 2 ( HER-2 ) negative breast cancer Part B , dose expansion neoadjuvant treatment HER-2 negative breast cancer patient germline Breast Cancer Susceptibility Gene ( BRCA ) 1/2 mutation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I , Open-Label , 2 Part Multicentre Study Assess Safety Efficacy Olaparib Combination With Carboplatin Patients With Advanced HER-2 Negative Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Part A 36 evaluable patient advance breast cancer enrol across 6 cohort . The total number patient depend number dose escalation necessary enable decision make recommend dose take forward Part B study . The plan dose escalation start cohort 1 , patient receive carboplatin ( AUC5 ) day 1 cycle 1 , start dose olaparib tablet dose 50 mg twice daily ( bd ) day 4 day 19 cycle 1 inclusive ( total 16 day per cycle ) . Patients receive carboplatin day 1 3 week cycle combination olaparib total 4 cycle . Provided safety concern assessment 6 evaluable patient first cohort , patient subsequent cohort may dose follow Safety Review Committee ( SRC ) approval . Dose escalation scheme may adjust study basis emerge safety , efficacy pharmacokinetic data . Those patient Part A tolerate combination include cycle 4 may remain treatment , either continue combination , carboplatin alone AUC olaparib alone dose 300 mg bd , opinion treat Investigator , patient deem derive clinical benefit treatment . In case , patient may remain treatment progression , unacceptable toxicity discontinuation criterion meet . Beyond cycle 4 , patient undergo assessment line clinical protocol . Once maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) and/or recommend dose ( RD ) define Part A , dose expansion phase , Part B begin include 21 patient HER2 negative breast cancer , deleterious suspect deleterious germlineBRCA1/2 ( gBRCA1/2 ) mutation , deem eligible neoadjuvant therapy . Part B explore safety , tolerability efficacy combination olaparib carboplatin term pathological complete response ( pCR ) rate . Neoadjuvant systemic therapy consist follow anti-cancer drug total 8 cycle treatment : - The first 4 cycle ( cycle 1 cycle 4 : 12 week ) base combination olaparib , define RD schedule Part A , carboplatin . It expect cycle treatment would 3 week . - Another 4 cycle ( cycle 5 cycle 8 ) base combination anthracycline cyclophosphamide ( AC ) . The choice AC regimen local Investigator follow international guideline ( National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( NCCN ) , European Society Medical Oncology ( ESMO ) , St Gallen ) . The tumour response assess careful clinical examination also radiological examination cycle 4 5 end neoadjuvant part , surgery . Additionally , tumour biopsy perform within 7 day cycle 5 day 1 , completion carboplatin olaparib combination therapy early pathological response assess local pathologist . Curative-intent surgery perform follow completion neoadjuvant treatment patient , 3 5 week day 1 last cycle neoadjuvant treatment . A decision make stop recruitment Part A cohort 2 , start Part B study . The protocol amend define collection clinical data stop final patient cohort 2 Part A complete 4 cycle patient cohort 2 Part A discontinue prior end cycle 4 enable data analysis reporting . The database would close time point , however AstraZeneca commits provide study treatment ongoing patient continue receive clinical benefit , Investigator 's judgment . Patients remain study treatment time point monitor accord routine clinical practice define Investigator clinical data collect , SAEs drug dispensing/accountability .</detailed_description>

Additional patient participate Part B Patients operable breast adenocarcinoma evidence metastatic disease allow . Patient must meet least one follow criterion : Clinical primary tumour size define T2 , clinical pathohistological evidence regional lymph node involvement ( N+ ) , grade 23 disease Availability formalin fix , paraffin embed tumour sample diagnostic biopsy ( Not Applicable patient sit Israel ) Histological confirmation HER2 negative breast cancer Documented germline mutation BRCA1 BRCA2 predict deleterious suspect deleterious Eligible neoadjuvant chemotherapy , yet receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy breast cancer ( chemonaive ) Exclusion criterion Exposure investigational product within 30 day 5 halflives ( whichever longer ) prior enrolment Prior use Poly ADP Ribose Polymerase ( PARP ) inhibitor Patients know hypersensitivity olaparib carboplatin Concurrent treatment ovarian hormonal replacement therapy hormonal agent raloxifene , tamoxifen selective estrogen receptor modulator . Patient must discontinue use agent 3 week prior begin study treatment . Luteinising hormoneReleasing hormone ( LHRH ) analogues allow patient Part A. Concomitant use know potent Cytochrome P450 3A4 ( CYP3A4 ) inhibitors inducer Persistent toxicity ( Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Event ( CTCAE ) grade ≥2 neuropathy CTCAE &gt; grade 1 ) cause previous cancer therapy , exclude alopecia Patient myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) /acute myeloid leukaemia ( AML ) feature suggestive MDS/AML Patient must recover effect major surgery Patient consider poor medical risk due serious , uncontrolled medical disorder , nonmalignant systemic disease active , uncontrolled seizure active uncontrolled infection Patient know active Hepatitis B C , Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) Other malignancy within last 5 year ( exception apply ) . Additional patient participate Part A Prior chemotherapy within 3 week study entry Other anticancer therapy ( eg , targeted biotherapy hormonal agent ) within 3 week study entry Radiation therapy within 4 week radionuclide treatment within 6 week treatment start Prior use platinum compound advance metastatic setting . Previous exposure platinum compound allow use early adjuvant neoadjuvant set relapse occur &gt; 6 month last platinum administration residual toxicity Patient history treat Central Nervous System ( CNS ) metastases eligible , provide meet certain protocolspecified criterion . Additional patient participate Part B Prior treatment ( local systemic ) breast tumour . Sentinel lymph node biopsy consider diagnostic procedure therefore authorize neoadjuvant treatment part B Patients inflammatory breast cancer patient inoperable locally advanced breast cancer ( include T4 lesion ) time enrolment .</criteria>
