	<brief_summary>Many large-scale epidemiological study establish link average consumption table salt ( sodium chloride ) blood pressure . In France survey conduct 2001 show average consumption salt 9 10g per people / day , health authority consider appropriate reduce consumption 20 % , limit contribution sodium prepare food , bread . In term basic clinical research , biological effect sodium chloride dietary intake , subject numerous study several decade . This work show subject react uniformly sodium chloride flow , determine investigator call people `` sodium-sensitive '' . For people sodium intake elevate blood pressure , much mark subject call `` sodium-resistant . '' `` Sodium-sensitive '' people represent 10 30 % population . A marked over-representation phenotype observe patient hypertension family history hypertension . In addition , study conduct animal human indicate sodium intake different impact biological parameter mention , do form chloride salt bicarbonate sodium . Based factor , investigator develop clinical trial protocol intend highlight possible differential effect biological effect sodium intake ( 2.56 g / day ) orally , depend nature salt .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pre-selection : Clinical Pharmacology Center Cardiology department Selection - Visit 1 : General practitioner 's office Clinical Pharmacology Center - Signature informed consent form - Check eligibility criterion - Clinical exam - Blood pressure measure - Blood sample ( renal biology ) - Collection concomitant treatment - Collection food habit - Delivery dietary instruction forbid treatment Phenotyping period : ( 192 subject ) All 192 subject realize 3 first visit order determine yes subject `` Sodium sensitive '' . Selection - Visit 1 : General practitioner 's office Clinical Pharmacology Center - Signature informed consent form - Check eligibility criterion - Clinical exam - Blood pressure measure - Blood sample ( renal biology ) - Collection concomitant treatment - Collection food habit - Delivery dietary instruction forbid treatment Visit 2 : General practitioner 's office Clinical Pharmacology Center - Collection adverse event concomitant treatment - Check biological analysis - Clinical examination - Blood pressure measure - Attribution treatment 2 week - Delivery diary blood pressure measure device Visit 3 : General practitioner 's office Clinical Pharmacology Center - Return diary , blood pressure measure device treatment - Collection adverse event concomitant treatment - Extraction data blood pressure - Delivery urinary bottle twenty-four-hour urine analysis Visit 4 Determination subject `` sodium sensitive `` . Sodium sensitive subject continue study non-sodium sensitive subject stop study . Wash-out period n°1 ( 2 week least ) pursuit dietary instruction . Cross study - Clinical Pharmacology Center : Center ( 48 subject ) All subject realize 4 visit cross study , receive Nacl placebo accord randomisation plan . Visit 4 visit 6 contain intervention participant ( exept consultation dietetician ) visit 5 et 7 regard intervention participant . First period Visit 4 - Day 0 : - Return urinary bottle - Collection adverse event concomitant treatment - Clinical examination - Blood pressure measure - Arterial compliance ( non invasive ) - Pregancy test ( woman childbearing age ) - Measure weight height - Impedancemetry - Blood sample biological analysis ( electrolyte pattern + serum creatinine + Renine + Aldosterone + Angiotensin II MPE assay ) - Assay urinary sodium excretion - Consultation dietician . - Delivery diet record , booklet complete every day study period - Reminder use blood pressure measure device - Delivery study treatment accord randomisation plan : 6.51 g NaCl per day distribute various meal + 1.5 liter spring water ( poor sodium ) drink day , Or placebo NaCl every day distribute various meal + 1.5 liter spring water ( sodium bicarbonate ) drink day . Every day 14 day The first take treatment do Clinical Pharmacology Center - Delivery urinary bottle twenty-four-hour urine analysis Visit 5 Visit 5 ( Day 14 ) : - Return urinary bottle , empty treatment ( check compliance ) , diet record booklet - Collection adverse event concomitant treatment - Clinical examination - Blood pressure measure - Arterial compliance ( non invasive ) - Measure weight - Impedancemetry - Blood sample biological analysis ( electrolyte pattern + serum creatinine + Renine + Aldosterone + Angiotensin II MPE assay ) - Assay urinary sodium excretion - Delivery urinary bottle twenty-four-hour urine analysis Visit 6 Wash-out 2 ( least 2 week ) pursuit dietary instruction . Second study period Visit 6 ( day28 ) - begin period 2 Visite 7 ( Day42 ) - end period 2 end study This second period first period , except subject consultation dietetician receive study treatment accord randomization plan . Ancillary Study This trial contain ancillary study genotypage ( optional specific consent subject ) aim confrontation phenotyping . For purpose , blood sample make period selection subject give consent , time blood sample renal biology visit 1 . These result would allow identify biomarkers blood pressure sensibility sodium .</detailed_description>
