	<detailed_description>Background : ASD diverse disorder start early childhood characterize social communication impairment well restricted interest repetitive behavior . It affect 1:68 child enormous medical economic problem establish , mechanism-based treatment . Sulforaphane isothiocyanate derive broccoli , potent activity transcriptionally up-regulating gene control mechanisms whereby aerobic cell protect oxidative stress , mitochondrial dysfunction , inflammation . Hypothesis : Based observation fever frequently associate behavioral improvement child ASD , hypothesize sulforaphane might lead functional improvement ASD up-regulate cell-protective response , heat shock protein relate mechanism also up-regulated fever . These mechanisms central multiple cellular process central nervous system , include synaptic transmission , may improve long-range cerebral cortical connectivity , depress ASD . Specific aim : The 3 specific aim study : 1 ) To determine measurable effect social responsiveness problem behavior treatment child sulforaphane ; 2 ) To determine treatment sulforaphane child safe well tolerate ; 3 ) To elucidate cellular biomarkers respond treatment sulforaphane . Design : This randomize , double blind , single-arm crossover phase 1/2 clinical trial orally administer sulforaphane ( broccoli seed powder ) 50 boys girl ( 3-12 year ) ASD 3 phase 36 week . In Phase 1 , 25 child receive active drug 25 receive placebo 15 week ; Phase 2 , child receive sulforaphane 15-30 week ; Phase 3 , child receive treatment 6 week . Study visit take place screening , 7 , 15 , 22 , 30 36 week , Ohio Autism Clinical Clinical Impressions Scale - Severity Improvement ( OACIS-S OACIS-I ) , Aberrant Behavior Checklist ( ABC ) Social Responsiveness Scale ( SRS ) record . The child monitor physical examination toxicity clinical laboratory study examine possible biomarkers : Nrf2 , oxidative stress mitochondrial function , mTOR pathway cytokine expression . In addition , prior main clinical trial , pilot study perform 10 child ASD , 6-12 year age , receive sulforaphane , 2.2 micromoles/kg daily 14 day . Blood urine sample end treatment collect , order measure several parameter likely demonstrate expect effect sulforaphane , standardize assay procedure , determine effective measure .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Autism Spectrum Disorder ( ASD ) diagnosis moderate great severity Age 3 12 year inclusive Absence parent legal guardian consent Inability speak/understand English language Seizure within 1 year screening : This exclusion base theoretical concern cellular activation sulforaphane might exacerbate seizure patient know seizure disorder . As noted previous trial sulforaphane young adult male , seizure occur 2 participant : one treatment ( participant previously undisclosed seizure ) , 3 week discontinue sulforaphane . Impaired renal function ( serum creatinine &gt; 1.2 mg/dl ) , impaired hepatic function ( SGOT/SGPT &gt; 2x upper limit normal ) , impaired thyroid function ( Thyroid Stimulating Hormone ( TSH ) outside normal limit ) : This exclusion base theoretical possibility activation underlie cellular metabolic abnormality sulforaphane . Current infection treatment antibiotic : exclusion avoid complication intercurrent illness may occur due clinical trial obscure possible effect sulforaphane . Medications may modify course test ASD parameter ( e.g. , prednisone ) : This exclusion necessary order interfere complicate effect sulforaphane . Chronic medical disorder ( e.g. , cardiovascular disease , stroke diabetes ) major surgery within 3 month prior enrollment : Serious medical illness child may complicate clinical trial make difficult discern change ASD associate treatment . Less 3 year 13 year age : age range select cover age usual diagnosis ASD adolescence . A diagnosis autism spectrum disorder mild severity ( example , early category Asperger disorder , Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified ( PDDNOS ) ) , accord Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule ( ADOS ) criterion .
