	<brief_summary>Purpose : Fibromyalgia syndrome ( FMS ) disable condition mainly characterize chronic widespread pain , disturbed sleep , fatigue , distress . The estimate overall prevalence FMS Europe 2.9 % incurs high personal , social healthcare cost . Available treatment FMS curative evidence positive effect mindfulness-based stress reduction ( MBSR ) patient chronic pain FMS . Nevertheless , although promising , positive finding obtain previous study implement mindfulness-based intervention patient FMS interpreted caution due important methodological limitation ( e.g . absence randomization , high attrition rate , small sample size ) . Therefore , research large study use adequate methodology warrant . Furthermore , little known putative neurobiological process underpinning effect mindfulness training patient chronic pain . Aims : The aim randomize , control trial ( RCT ) two-fold : firstly , assess effectiveness cost-utility MBSR add treatment usual ( TAU ) ; secondly , evaluate effect compare intervention neurobiological parameter . Specifically , MBSR compare active control previously report cost-effective intervention ( TAU + FibroQol psycho-educational program ; Luciano et al. , 2013 ) also vs. TAU alone ( 12-month follow-up RCT ) . Brain structure function pain-relevant area level inflammation marker ( cytokine ) assess pre-post intervention half study participant . Methods : Design : RCT three arm : 1 . TAU + MBSR , 2 . TAU + FibroQoL 3 . TAU . Sample : 180 adult FMS accord ACR 1990 criterion ( N=60 study arm ) recruit Parc Sanitari Sant Joan de Déu Rheumatology Service , Sant Boi de Llobregat , Spain . Half participant randomly select participate neurobiological pre-post evaluation ( N= 30 group ) . All patient assess baseline , post-intervention 12-month follow-up clinical variable , prep-post intervention biomarkers study , baseline 12-month follow-up cost-related variable .</brief_summary>
