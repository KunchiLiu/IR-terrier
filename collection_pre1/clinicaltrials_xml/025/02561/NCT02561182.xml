	<brief_title>Bone Health Patients With Overgrowth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It known patient complex vascular malformation risk decrease bone density even vanish bone disease . However , know patient OGS decrease bone density location distant vascular malformation . This study look bone health patient 's OGS cross sectional fashion . If find particular risk decrease bone density address early childhood , nutrition activity recommendation . The study consist 15 participant , know clinical diagnosis overgrowth syndrome , &gt; 5 year old co operate DEXA Xtreme CT scan . Study specific : - They ask specific question regard medical family history intake form fill . - The height , weight , body mass index Tanner stage measurement record visit . - Photos affected area ( ) take , however , optional . - A urine pregnancy test do female childbearing potential . - Laboratory study perform patient . - A 24-hour urine sample collect adult able willing ; child able unwilling provide 24-hour urine , spot urine collect . - Bone age assess via plain film wrist - Bone density assess patient via DEXA scan - Cortical trabecular parameter bone strength assess HRpQCT</detailed_description>
