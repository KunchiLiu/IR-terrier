	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine mean median fractional exhale nitric oxide ( FeNO ) Thai atopic asthmatic child divide subgroup due asthma exacerbation accord global initiative asthma guideline .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Correlation Between Fractional Exhaled Nitric Oxide ( FeNO ) Levels Asthma Exacerbation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>From many previous study , fractional exhale nitric oxide ( FeNO ) many benefit non-invasive , easily perform , less time consume , direct association severity inflammation bronchial tree sputum eosinophil , benefit diagnosis monitoring treatment asthmatic patient . In Thailand , field study less extend , especially child population . The investigator hypothesize patient asthma exacerbation may high level fractional exhale nitric oxide ( FeNO ) non exacerbation group . It therefore desirable examine association fractional exhale nitric oxide ( FeNO ) asthma exacerbation among atopic asthmatic Thai child main objective research .</detailed_description>
