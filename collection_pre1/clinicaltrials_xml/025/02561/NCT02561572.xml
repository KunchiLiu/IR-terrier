	<brief_title>The Effect Acupuncture Pre-operative Anxiety Levels Neurosurgical Patients : Randomised , Controlled Trail</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Methodology All patient present neurosurgery consider study take place Theatre Admissions Units Royal Hallamshire Hospital , Sheffield , United Kingdom . After gain consent , baseline anxiety level assess use APAIS STAI questionnaire . The subject randomise use web-based programme one two group : intervention ( Yintang point ) , control ( intervention ) . All acupuncture do type needle investigator . The questionnaire repeat 30 minute later assess effect intervention . 2 . Design : type study design justification The study randomise control trial look acupuncture point utilised anxiety reduction ( Yintang ) , control . The ratio intervention control 1:1 . After advice expert acupuncture , investigator include placebo acupuncture intervention sham acupuncture . This increasingly recognised form acupuncture acupressure central effect sham acupuncture actually impossible undertake . Pilot study data ( await publication ) do investigator 's institution demonstrate mean ( standard deviation ) STAI score neurosurgical patient 8.86 ( 4.4 ) . Previous data suggest acupuncture may reduce anxiety level 25-37 % . Assuming p &lt; 0.05 power 0.9 , order demonstrate 30 % reduction STAI score , investigator need 58 patient group . Assuming 10 % dropout rate , investigator aim recruit 64 patient group ( 128 total ) . The investigator show anxiety level relate gender site surgery ( cranial vs. spinal ) therefore stratify group . The investigator undertake block randomisation try minimise learn effect acupuncturist . 3 . Analysis include statistical method , appropriate The investigator use analysis variance ( ANOVA ) analyse anxiety score two questionnaire ( test normality data distribution ) . Pain score analyse t-tests postoperative nausea vomiting ( PONV ) incidence Chi-squared .</detailed_description>
