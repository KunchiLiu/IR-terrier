	<detailed_description>The number patient receive Percutaneous Coronary Intervention ( PCI ) rapidly increase China . In 2013 , 450,000 Chinese patient receive PCI , suffer coronary heart disease ( CHD ) , especially acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) . ACS associate increase risk cardiovascular mortality recurrent cardiac event , underscore importance identify treatment minimize risk.The Myocardial Ischemia Reduction Aggressive Cholesterol Lowering ( MIRACL ) trial suggest benefit lipid lower high-dose atorvastatin patient ACS . A meta-analysis statin use patient ACS confirm benefit early high-dose statin administration decrease recurrent myocardial ischemia , suggest clinical benefit safety statins dose statin dependent . The updated National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guideline recommend intensive therapy consider patient admit hospital ACS . Two meta-analyses show early intensive statin therapy patient ACS associate reduced rate death cardiovascular event . In PROVE IT study , compare atorvastatin 80 mg pravastatin 40 mg , significant reduction major adverse clinical event observe favour intensive statin treatment . In study , median concentration low-density LDL-C lower 106 mg/dL 62 mg/dL atorvastatin 80 mg group . More recently , 2011 European Society Cardiology ( ESC ) / European Arterial Sclerosis Association ( EAS ) guideline management dyslipidemia recommend patient ACS high CV risk patient achieve LDL-C level &lt; 70 mg/dl 50 % reduction . In 2011 American College Cardiology Foundation ( ACCF ) / American Heart Association ( AHA ) / ( cardiovascular angiography intervention Association ) / Association Cardiovascular angiography intervention ( SCAI ) Guideline PCI , statin therapy lower LDL &lt; 70mg/dL high-risk patient recommend ( IIa , B ) . The late China ACS consensus also recommend use high dose statin treatment acute phase attain LDL-C level 1.8 mmol/L 50 % reduction compare baseline long-term treatment . However , limited Chinese data demonstrate current situation lipid management ( LDL-C on-goal rate ) different statin real-world clinical practice . Most PCI patient high CV risk , increase need intensive lipid management PCI patient population well suit demonstrate rosuvastatin 's LDL-C lowering efficacy.Most PCI patient high CV risk , increase need intensive lipid management PCI patient population well suit demonstrate rosuvastatin 's LDL-C lower efficacy.The purpose study observe effectiveness statin lipid level reduction ( LDL-C , HDL-C , TG , non-HDL-C ) lipid goal attainment accord recent guideline .</detailed_description>
