	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy Lenalidomide Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Stage II-IV Peripheral T-cell Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety efficacy lenalidomide combination standard induction therapy ( CHOEP- cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin [ doxorubicin hydrochloride ] , etoposide , vincristine [ vincristine sulfate ] prednisone ) patient newly diagnose stage II , III IV peripheral T-cell lymphoma otherwise specify ( NOS ) , anaplastic large cell lymphoma ( anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase [ ALK ] negative ) ( ALK positive International Prognostic Index [ IPI ] 3 , 4 , 5 ) , angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma , enteropathy associate T-cell lymphoma hepatosplenic gamma delta T-cell lymphoma . II . To establish maximum tolerate dose lenalidomide combination CHOEP chemotherapy . ( Phase I ) III . To assess efficacy ( complete response rate ) combination . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate overall response rate ( complete response [ CR ] + partial response [ PR ] ) combination lenalidomide CHOEP chemotherapy . II . To evaluate safety tolerability regimen . III . To assess 2 year progression free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) use regimen . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study lenalidomide , follow phase II study . Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously ( IV ) , doxorubicin hydrochloride IV vincristine sulfate IV day 1 , etoposide IV 30-60 minute day 1-3 , prednisone orally ( PO ) day 1-5 lenalidomide PO day 1-10 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients respond 6 course treatment may undergo autologous stem cell transplant receive maintenance lenalidomide discretion physician patient choice follow : TRANSPLANT : Patients undergo autologous stem cell transplant per standard care . MAINTENANCE LENALIDOMIDE : Patients receive lenalidomide PO day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
