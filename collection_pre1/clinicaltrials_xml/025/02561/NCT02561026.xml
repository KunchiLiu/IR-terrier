	<brief_summary>Frozen plasma ( FP ) commonly transfuse patient abnormal coagulation result prior medical procedure associate risk bleeding ( e.g . involve needle incision ) . The frequent group require FP transfusion patient admit intensive care unit . These patient frequently abnormal coagulation test also frequently require invasive medical procedure associate bleed . While FP transfusion improve abnormal coagulation test result , evidence suggest prophylactic FP transfusion reduce bleed associate medical procedure patient mild coagulation abnormality . Additionally , know important adverse complication occur FP transfusion . The investigator undertake pilot randomize control trial non-bleeding ICU patient require invasive medical procedure ( central venous catheterization , chest tube , thoracocentesis , paracentesis , biopsy , fluid drainage ) 3 Canadian hospital . Patients abnormal coagulation test ( INR 1.5 2.5 ) receive FP transfusion treatment prior invasive procedure . The primary outcome pilot study feasibility ( number patient enrol per month ) . Other important outcome include evaluated definitive trial include bleed post procedure , red cell transfusion , adverse transfusion reaction , mortality hospital length stay . The objective study enrol 80 patient 2 year 3 Canadian hospital .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There 3 accept indication transfuse FP : 1. bleeding patient prolonged coagulation test correct product medication , 2. prior surgery invasive procedure patient prolonged coagulation test correct product medication 3. plasmapheresis Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia Purpura . While indication FP seem relatively straightforward , still large variation use important inappropriate use . This due lack properly conduct study evaluate true risk bleed patient abnormal coagulation test , consequence , lack knowledge true benefit harm transfuse FP reduce bleed . The current paradigm use FP treat prevent bleed base follow assumption : 1. elevated coagulation test represent decrease coagulation factor contribute bleeding , 2 . FP transfusion increase level coagulation factor correct coagulation test abnormality , 3. correction coagulation test abnormality decrease bleeding . However , lack evidence support assumption paradigm . First , decrease coagulation factor level may increase risk bleeding , occur coagulation factor level decrease minimum hemostatic threshold . The minimum hemostatic coagulation factor 30 % . In vitro data demonstrates , sample single factor coagulation deficiency , commonly use coagulation test , prothrombin time ( usually report international normalized ratio ( INR ) activate partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT ) become abnormal level 25-40 % . However , set multiple factor deficiency , situation usually encounter clinical practice , mild moderate increase INR see coagulation factor level considerably high minimum hemostatic threshold 30 % . Work group others confirm patient critical illness liver disease factor level consistently hemostatic threshold even INR elevate . This lack correlation abnormal coagulation test result increase bleed risk support systematic review observational study show increased bleeding risk patient abnormal coagulation test compare patient normal coagulation test . Second , expect improvement coagulation factor test follow FP transfusion often see especially mild moderate coagulation test abnormality . Given concentration 1 unit/ml individual coagulation factor level FP , transfuse four unit FP ( approximately 800-1000 ml ) 70 kg patient 5-litre blood volume , would expect increase level maximum 16 % . However , effect INR also depend start level coagulation factor . If level low ( less 10 % ) , result significant improvement INR , initial level mildly decrease , increase coagulation factor level make little change INR . Furthermore , INR FP unit high 1.3 . The lack efficacy FP correct INR aPTT patient mild increase INR demonstrate number study . Finally , little data clinical study demonstrate attempt correct abnormal coagulation test FP reduce bleed . Based clinical experience , patient high INR active bleeding , FP may beneficial control bleeding . However , prophylactic use FP never show reduce bleed . The prospective clinical trial show reduction bleed follow FP transfusion neonate , patient pancreatitis cardiac surgery . A retrospective study FP use critical care patient show difference bleed administration FP . Overall randomize control study examine efficacy effectiveness FP transfusion . Only 3 randomize control study evaluate effectiveness FP ( compare treatment ) prior invasive procedure carry . All 3 study fail recruit sufficient patient due important issue design trial . The main failure first two study narrow eligibility criterion . Two study include patient undergo single type procedure include patient mild coagulation abnormality ( i.e . INR equivalent less 2.0 ) . Thus , many patient modest coagulation abnormality exclude thereby leave small pool potentially eligible patient . The third study fail recruit patient number reason include restrictive inclusion criterion inability obtain consent emergency procedure especially hour . While study recruit patient undergo variety invasive procedure use wider INR threshold , reduce number potentially eligible patient include patient thrombocytopenia patient anti-platelet agent ( common ICU patient ) . Less 30 % eligible patient enrol informed consent patient surrogate require prior enrol patient . As ICU patient frequently prolong INR test require urgent procedure time admission , deferred consent process ability enroll patient hour absolutely essential ensure eligible ICU patient usually able give consent systematically exclude trial due need inform consent . In summary , FP commonly transfuse prior invasive procedure patient elevate INR . Remarkably , evidence transfuse FP reduces bleed complication transfuse prophylactically . Observational data suggests elevate INR increase risk bleed invasive procedure . However , randomize clinical trial data support transfuse FP . This lack evidence combine fear cause bleed invasive procedure under-appreciation potential harm associate blood transfusion contribute continued practice transfuse FP prior invasive procedure . Given mild moderately increased coagulation test associate increased bleeding follow invasive procedure FP transfusion know partially correct abnormal coagulation test , prophylactic use FP may expose patient potentially life-threatening adverse reaction without provide benefit . Previous randomize controlled trial FP transfusion prior invasive procedure fail enroll sufficient patient , important limitation design affect ability recruit patient . A pilot study require determine , use specific strategy increase enrollment , large pragmatic clinical trial successfully implement determine benefit safety transfuse FP prior invasive procedure . The plan study pragmatic open common procedure ICU patient know represent large group patient receive FP . This study multi-center , open-label , randomize control pilot trial blind outcome assessment . In trial evaluate feasibility , investigator randomly allocate ICU patient elevate INR require invasive procedure receive either FP transfusion transfusion . Patients follow bleeding complication adverse transfusion reaction 48 hour follow invasive procedure , mortality duration hospital stay . All bleeding complication record use validated bleeding score adjudicate blinded assessor .</detailed_description>
