	<criteria>1 . The subject least 18 year age may either sex/gender race ethnicity . 2 . The subject schedule undergo nonemergent PCI nonemergent cardiac catheterization intention perform PCI . The following classification urgency procedure time operator decides perform use randomization stratification : Elective : The cardiac catheterization procedure ± PCI perform outpatient basis subsequent hospitalization without significant risk MI death . For stable inpatient , procedure perform hospitalization convenience ease schedule subject 's clinical situation demand procedure perform prior discharge . OR Urgent : The cardiac catheterization ± PCI procedure perform inpatient basis discharge significant concern risk myocardial ischemia , MI and/or death .
