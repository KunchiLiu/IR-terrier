	<brief_summary>Chronic blood transfusion essential supportive care sickle cell patient high risk morbidity mortality due stroke . These patient , however , risk iron overload . In investigator 's comprehensive sickle cell center , investigator support chronic transfusion rapid manual partial exchange transfusion ( RMPET ) use single access central line port . The investigator comprehensive adult sickle cell program upon transition patient patient would provide simple transfusion ( ST ) adult ambulatory infusion set due nursing acuity need RMPET . The investigator plan study institution 's participant currently chronic transfusion support compare different transfusion modality well understand effect switch RMPET ST. To date , comparison within sickle cell patient literature .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Two Methods Transfusion Stroke Prevention Sickle Cell</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>II . Objective . Compare differences RMPET versus ST. III . Specific Aims : 1 . To compare key predictive hematologic factor ( hematocrit , hemoglobin , hemoglobin S quantification , blood volume alloantibody ) relative risk stroke utilizing two method blood transfusion therapy . 2 . To determine nursing time administer straight versus manual exchange transfusion therapy . 3 . To survey patient satisfaction procedure . IV : Background/Significance : Stroke occur 10 % Sickle Cell Disease ( SCD ) patient age 20 Years . Current standard care secondary overt stroke prevention patient SCD chronic red blood cell ( RBC ) transfusion . Stroke recur ~ 60 % patient without chronic RBC therapy ~ 20 % patient chronic transfusion maintain hemoglobin S percentage le 30 % . Indefinite transfusion therapy practice discontinuation short-term long-term prophylactic transfusion lead recurrent overt stroke ensue CNS damage , even transition hydroxyurea . Chronic transfusion also prevent initial stroke high-risk patient identify transcranial Doppler ( TCD ) ultrasound . The Stroke Prevention Study Sickle Cell Disease ( STOP ) demonstrate 92 % stroke risk reduction among 63 130 child abnormal TCD result . Rates stroke decline significantly since implement routine TCD screen primary prophylactic transfusion therapy . The subsequent STOP 2 trial support use chronic transfusion indefinitely discontinuation result increased rate abnormal TCD conversion development overt stroke . Discontinuing transfusion STOP 2 trial also associate high occurrence silent cerebral infarct , document 3 37 patient ( 8.1 % ) continued-transfusion group compare 11 40 ( 27.5 % ) transfusion-halted group . More recent study demonstrate SCD patient also risk silent cerebral infarct . An association worsen vasculopathy show magnetic resonance angiography progressive overt silent infarct magnetic resonance imaging find . More aggressive magnetic resonance image screening may indicate could result patient SCD treat chronic transfusion . Common chronic transfusion modality include ST RMPET . The goal therapy reduce hemoglobin S level either dilute blood ( ST ) remove replace blood non-sickle hemoglobin ( RMPET ) . To prevent brain injury , goal transfusion therapy lower hemoglobin S quantification le 30 % routine basis , usually monthly transfusion procedure . There many large center utilize erythrocytapheresis consider preferable method available . The investigator 's study focus type RBC exchange therapy currently utilized investigator 's Infusion Clinic T.C . Thompson Children 's Hospital . The investigator determine transfusion method best participant achieve hematologic parameter low hemoglobin S quantification.The investigator also measure amount nursing time procedure method prefer participant . The investigator share institutional observation institution may intend switch RMPET ST. V. Methods : Study Design : Prospective observational cohort study The investigator utilize institution 's current population 8 eligible chronically exchange transfused participant T.C . Thompson Children 's Infusion Clinic . The eligible participant invite participate cross design study participant serf control . Eight participant randomly assign ( blind envelope ) whereby four participant start rapid manual partial exchange transfusion : 3 month spent wash period , 3 month data collection RMPET . This group switch simple transfusion wash period three month , data collection three month . The second group four participant start simple transfusion identical study design 12 month ( 3 month collect data simple transfusion , 3 month wash period , switch rapid manual partial exchange transfusion three month , 3 month data collection RMPET ) . The investigator optimize therapy achieve post transfusion goal &lt; 30 % hemoglobin S post transfusion Hb &lt; 12g/DL.with transfusion perform best practice avoid sickle cell complication .</detailed_description>
