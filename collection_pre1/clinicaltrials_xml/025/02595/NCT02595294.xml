	<brief_title>Hypoalgesic Effect Neural Mobilization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Cervical Lateral Glide ( CLG ) neural tissue mobilization technique capable achieve hypoalgesic effect onset cervicobrachial pain symptom . This happen series complex physiologic interaction fully understood . The CLG Physical therapy technique consist control movement cervical brachial plexus neural tissue . Hypoalgesic effect produce CLG associate increase neural tissue mobility , edema , inflammation intraneural pressure reduction , without know side effect apply properly , except momentary worsening symptom ( known side effect CLG ) , important contrast wide sometimes severe spectrum side effect derive drug therapy use treat cervicobrachial pain . It believe hypoalgesic effect offer neural tissue mobilization consequence descend nervous system pain modulation activity improvement distinct biomechanical property involve neural tissue.Despite increase scientific interest evidence base option treat pain neural tissue mobilization technique current lack enough control double blind clinical trial measure effectiveness neural tissue mobilization technique CLG specific effect cervicobrachial pain . For reason present investigation consist application treatment protocol base CLG neural tissue mobilization control double blind clinical trial aim assess clinical effectiveness treat pain symptom</detailed_description>
