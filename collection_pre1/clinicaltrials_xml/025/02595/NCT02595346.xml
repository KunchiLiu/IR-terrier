	<brief_title>Study Efficiency Hydroxychloroquine Endothelial Dysfunction Its Vascular Consequences During Antiphospholipid Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Antiphospholipid syndrome ( APS ) autoimmune disease characterized recurrent thrombotic event miscarriage , persistently positive antiphospholipid antibody ( aPL ) . APS may isolate ( primary APS ) associate connective tissue disease , often systemic lupus erythematous ( SLE ) . Pathogenic effect aPL first describe demonstration vitro incubation endothelial cell monocytes aPL induce endothelial dysfunction characterize pro-coagulant ( overexpression tissue factor modulation protein C S ) , pro-inflammatory ( increased level IL-6 ( interleukin 6 ) , IL-1β TNFα ) pro-adhesive ( increased level ICAM-1 ( intercellular adhesion molecule ) , VCAM-1 ( vascular endothelial cell adhesion molecule ) E-selectin ) phenotype . In parallel investigator others report endothelial function , assess flow mediate dilatation , alter patient primary secondary form APS . Although role TLR ( toll-like receptor ) -mediated NFkB translocation advance , pathogenic mechanism lead vivo endothelial injury APS incompletely understand . In experimental model , investigator demonstrate passive transfer human aPL mouse induce marked endothelial dysfunction assess ex vivo small resistance artery , increase TNFα level . Moreover , investigator group demonstrate patient primary arterial APS display endothelial dysfunction structural arterial change , associate pro-oxidative pro-coagulant state activation TLR2 TLR4 signal pathway . Recently , preliminary study investigator find endothelial glycocalyx important part vascular barrier intimately link homeostatic function endothelium alter APL patient . Hydroxychloroquine ( HCQ ) antimalarial drug , also use treat rheumatic disease SLE . There experimental evidence suggest direct role hydroxychloroquine pathophysiology APS : directly reduce bind antibody phospholipid bilayers , protect annexin A5 anticoagulant shield reverse platelet adhesion induce aPL . Furthermore known decrease expression lysosomal TLRs , also extra lysosomal TLR2 TLR4 . The aim study investigate whether treatment hydroxychloroquine modulate vascular endothelial function patient .</detailed_description>
