	<detailed_description>Healthy adult ( n=20 ) recruit informed consent obtain . Participants agree number visit , Baseline Visit , 6 Study Visits , follow-up Safety Visit . Each course study drug follow washout , allow preexisting medication stop study participation . A small subset ( n=4 ) participant also undergo MRI scan component visit follow drug administration . Baseline Visit : Cognition assess variety measure , determine baseline declarative memory work memory . Mood assess psychiatric interview , self-assessments , review stand physical symptom complete comparison side effect develop medication administration . Vital sign record woman screen pregnancy . Blood collect complete blood count ( CBC ) comprehensive metabolic panel ( CMP ) . Visit 1 : Participants randomize one three treatment possibility : 1 ) phenytoin megestrol , 2 ) placebo megestrol , 3 ) placebo placebo . Participants receive phenytoin ( 200 mg BID ) placebo instructed take medication one full day ( two dos ) start megestrol . They take medication total 3.5 day . Visit 2 : After participant complete medication course morning visit day , return cognition mood reassess . Vital sign take blood drawn ass CMP , CBC , cortisol phenytoin level . Participants enter `` washout '' period medicine combination ( approximately 3 week ) return next visit . For participant offer MRI scan , visit extend approximately 3 hour . Visit 3 : Participants return randomized one remain two treatment possibility detail . Participants instruct start first medication take one full day take second medication , instructed take second medication start follow day start first medication 0900 hour continue take drug 3 consecutive day .
