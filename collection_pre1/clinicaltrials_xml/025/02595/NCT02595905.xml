	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well cisplatin work without veliparib treat patient stage IV triple-negative breast cancer and/or breast cancer ( BRCA ) mutation-associated breast cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , cisplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Veliparib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . It yet know cisplatin effective without veliparib treat patient triple-negative and/or BRCA mutation-associated breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cisplatin With Without Veliparib Treating Patients With Stage IV Triple-Negative and/or BRCA Mutation-Associated Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare efficacy cisplatin without ABT-888 ( veliparib ) progression-free survival ( PFS ) follow group : patient germline BRCA ( gBRCA ) mutation-associated breast cancer , patient germline BRCA wild-type breast cancer evidence BRCAness phenotype , patient germline BRCA wild-type breast cancer evidence BRCAness phenotype . II . To compare efficacy cisplatin without ABT-888 PFS patient triple negative and/or gBRCA mutation-associated breast cancer brain metastasis . ( Brain metastases cohort ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . For patient gBRCA mutation associate breast cancer triple-negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) without BRCAness phenotype , compare efficacy cisplatin without ABT-888 overall survival ( OS ) , response rate , clinical benefit rate . II . To compare differential benefit ABT-888 across three group use PFS OS outcomes . III . For patient brain metastasis cohort , compare efficacy cisplatin without ABT-888 OS . IV . For patient brain metastasis cohort , compare efficacy cisplatin without ABT-888 intracranial extracranial response rate ( intracranial Response Assessment Neuro-Oncology Criteria [ RANO ] extracranial Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors version 1.1 [ RECIST 1.1 ] ) . V. To compare toxicity ABT-888 placebo four group separately . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate impact homologous recombination deficiency score ( independent BRCAness marker ) response rate ( RR ) PFS patient treat chemotherapy versus chemotherapy plus ABT-888 . II . To evaluate overlap among various marker utilized define BRCAness phenotype . III . To evaluate combined impact PAM50 basal subtype BRCAness phenotype RR PFS patient treat chemotherapy versus chemotherapy plus ABT-888 . IV . To evaluate impact BRCA1 mRNA expression ( independent BRCAness marker ) response rate ( RR ) PFS patient treat chemotherapy versus chemotherapy plus ABT-888 . V. Application somatic BRCAness phenotype marker metastatic tumor tissue identify patient likely benefit platinum-based therapy ABT-888 . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive cisplatin intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour day 1 placebo orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-14 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive cisplatin IV 1 hour day 1 veliparib PO BID day 1-14 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 9 week 54 week , every 18 week progression , every 6 month 5 year progression .</detailed_description>
