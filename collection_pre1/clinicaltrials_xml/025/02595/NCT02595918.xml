	<brief_title>Nivolumab Treating Patients With High-Risk Non-Metastatic Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To study safety feasibility neoadjuvant nivolumab administration subject resectable , high-risk , non-metastatic renal cell carcinoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess overall response rate patient receive neoadjuvant nivolumab . II . To assess recurrence free survival 2 year patient receive neoadjuvant nivolumab . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate association baseline tumor mutational burden immune infiltration radiographic tumor response nivolumab . II . To explore predicted express tumor neoantigens correlation radiographic tumor response nivolumab . III . To explore association predict immune signature ( via ribonucleic acid sequence [ RNAseq ] ) tumor microenvironment radiographic tumor response nivolumab . IV . To determine whether change tumor microenvironment , , therapy associate response . V. To assess potential association program death-ligand 1 ( PD-L1 ) expression ( immunohistochemistry [ IHC ] ) radiographic tumor response nivolumab . OUTLINE : Patients receive nivolumab intravenously ( IV ) 60 minute day -56 , -42 , -28 , -14 absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo surgery day 0 . After completion study treatment , patient follow 14-28 day , 90 day , 24-28 month .</detailed_description>
