	<brief_summary>Diabetes mellitus type 1 ( DM1 ) autoimmune metabolic disease insulin produce cell pancreas destroy subject leave totally dependent external supply insulin . There known cure DM1 except specific situation . Thus , management DM1 concentrate keep blood glucose level close normal level . As aid subject DM1 manage blood glucose level close normal possible , blood glucose monitor system develop . Available blood glucose monitoring system today require capillary blood sample analyse glucose meter . Subjects normally advise health care professional appropriate blood glucose monitoring regime condition . However , many subject fail measure blood glucose often need achieve good blood glucose control despite every effort health care professional . Research development non-invasive interstitial blood glucose monitoring method ongoing . All attempt develop non-invasive continuous glucose measure device far fail . Prediktor Medical AS develop non-invasive sensor , GlucoPred , base combination several non-invasive measurement principle multivariate analysis dynamic model glucose/insulin interaction . The device body mount form bracelet watch communicate mobile phone tablet data presentation collection . Development GlucoPred stage test sensor subject control setting require development take place . If successful , major step ahead patient diabetes markedly increase possibility take care disease day day basis without burden frequent blood sample wear invasive device .</brief_summary>
