	<brief_title>Nivolumab After Surgery Chemotherapy Treating Patients With Stage IB-IIIA Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate whether adjuvant therapy nivolumab result improve overall survival ( OS ) and/or disease-free survival ( DFS ) standard observation patient stage IB &gt; = 4 cm , II IIIA , non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) follow surgical resection standard adjuvant therapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety profile nivolumab give adjuvant therapy . II . To evaluate compare disease free overall survival patient tumor express program cell death ligand ( PD-L ) 1 various pattern associate nivolumab standard observation . III . To evaluate compare disease free overall survival patient tumor high mutational load associate nivolumab standard observation . IV . To evaluate OS DFS stage . V. To evaluate OS DFS stratification factor . VI . To evaluate proportion patient alive progression free 1 year , 2 year , 5 year ( OS DFS rate ) . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive nivolumab intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 2 week 1 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients follow serially image . After completion study treatment , patient follow 6 week , every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 2 year , every 12 month 6 year .</detailed_description>
