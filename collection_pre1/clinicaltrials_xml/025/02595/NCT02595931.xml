	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) recommend phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) ATR kinase inhibitor VX-970 ( VX-970 ) combination irinotecan hydrochloride ( irinotecan ) patient advance solid tumor . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate safety tolerability VX-970 combination irinotecan . II . To document anti-tumor activity . Anti-tumor activity measure overall response rate ( ORR ) progression-free survival ( PFS ) . III . To determine pharmacokinetic ( PK ) pharmacodynamic ( PD ) parameters VX-970 irinotecan . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To identify molecular subpopulation patient increase sensitivity irinotecan VX-970 combination . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) 90 minute ATR kinase inhibitor VX-970 IV 60 minute day 1 15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day , 3 6 month .</detailed_description>
