	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate effectiveness indwell tunneled pleural catheter ( ITPC ) management hepatic hydrothorax responsive conventional medical therapy . Hepatic Hydrothorax ( HH ) define accumulation fluid pleural space chest wall lung occur 5-10 % patient liver disease . Despite medical therapy diuretic salt restriction , many patient still experience intractable , debilitate shortness breath , often necessitating hospital admission . Repeated thoracentesis , procedure hepatic hydrothorax drain needle may effective , often temporary prior reaccumulation fluid lead requirement repeat procedure . Trans-jugular intrahepatic porto-systemic shunt ( TIPS ) , valuable treatment HH , always effective able perform . Similarly , liver transplantation although potentially curative , available many patient may significantly delay . Many patient experience sufficient timely relief current conventional therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hepatic Hydrothorax ( HH ) occur 5-10 % cirrhotic patient remain significant clinical challenge . Despite medical therapy diuretic sodium restriction , many patient still experience intractable , debilitate dyspnea respiratory compromise . Repeated thoracentesis , often effective , may affect prohibitively transient symptom relief expose patient repeat procedure inherent cumulative risk . Trans-jugular intrahepatic porto-systemic shunt ( TIPS ) , valuable treatment HH , always effective able perform . Similarly , liver transplantation although potentially curative , available many patient may significantly delay . Many patient experience sufficient timely relief current conventional therapy . There exist need additional therapy , either bridge transplantation TIPS , palliation transplantation expect . The insertion Indwelling tunnel pleural catheter ( ITPC ) may prove safe effective treating dyspnea , cough , hypoxemia associate HH patient refractory conventional medical management , serve effective bridge transplantation TIPS . ITPCs show successfully safely control dyspnea patient malignant pleural effusion ; produce long-lasting plurodesis great 50 % recipient . Compared large amount publish data regard use ITPC malignant effusion , paucity data regard use ITPC benign disease ; particularly HH . A small series four patient single case report previously describe successful use ITPC management HH . There exist need prospective study investigate potential benefit use ITPCs patient HH .</detailed_description>
