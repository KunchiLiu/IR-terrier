	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect pembrolizumab treat patient human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) malignant neoplasms come back ( relapse ) , respond treatment ( refractory ) , distribute large area body ( disseminate ) . Monoclonal antibody , pembrolizumab , may block tumor cancer growth different way target certain cell . It may also help immune system kill cancer cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab Treating Patients With HIV Relapsed , Refractory , Disseminated Malignant Neoplasms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety tolerability MK-3475 ( pembrolizumab ) HIV-infected patient effective antiretroviral therapy relapsed/refractory disseminate acquire immune deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) -defining non-AIDS defining malignancy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To obtain preliminary insight clinical benefit ( e.g. , tumor shrinkage stabilization &gt; = 24 week ) across variety tumor patient infected HIV effective antiretroviral therapy . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess effect pre-therapy tumor program death-ligand 1 ( PD-L1 ) expression T-cell infiltration clinical benefit . II . To assess effect MK-3475 ( pembrolizumab ) circulate HIV HIV viral reservoir patient effective combination anti-retroviral therapy ( cART ) , measure plasma HIV single copy ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) , cluster differentiation ( CD ) 4+ T-cell associate HIV unspliced RNA , CD4+ T-cell associate integrated HIV deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) provirus , ratio HIV unspliced RNA/DNA , `` Tat/Rev induce limit dilution assay '' ( TILDA ) , phylogenetic analysis HIV-1 molecular evolution . III . To evaluate effect MK-3475 ( pembrolizumab ) host gene expression circulate blood cell . IV . To evaluate effect MK-3475 ( pembrolizumab ) circulate HIV-specific CD8+ T-cell cytotoxicity autologous HIV infect CD4+ T-cells patient effective antiretroviral therapy . V. To evaluate effect MK-3475 ( pembrolizumab ) circulate lymphocyte monocyte number phenotype . VI . To assess biopsy tumor participant progress immunohistochemistry array gene expression analysis evaluate potential reason lack response MK-3475 ( pembrolizumab ) progression lack T cell within around tumor . OUTLINE : Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 . Patients continue receive recommend combination antiretroviral therapy orally daily . Courses repeat every 21 day 2 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 year .</detailed_description>
