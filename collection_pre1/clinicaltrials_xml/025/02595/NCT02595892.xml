	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well Ataxia-telangiectasia Rad3-related [ ATR ] kinase inhibitor VX-970 ( VX-970 ) gemcitabine hydrochloride work compare standard treatment gemcitabine hydrochloride alone treat patient ovarian , primary peritoneal , fallopian tube cancer come back period improvement ( recurrent ) . ATR kinase inhibitor VX-970 may stop growth tumor cell block enzyme need cell growth , may also help gemcitabine hydrochloride work well . Gemcitabine hydrochloride drug use chemotherapy work stop growth tumor cell block cell grow repairing , cause die . It yet know whether add ATR kinase inhibitor VX-970 standard treatment gemcitabine hydrochloride effective gemcitabine hydrochloride alone treat patient ovarian , primary peritoneal , fallopian tube cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess compare progression free survival ( PFS ) gemcitabine ( gemcitabine hydrochloride ) /VX-970 gemcitabine alone arm . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine compare overall response rate ( ORR ) Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) gemcitabine/VX-970 gemcitabine alone arm . II . Determine compare safety profile gemcitabine/VX-970 gemcitabine alone regimens . III . Assess compare PFS 6 month gemcitabine/VX-970 gemcitabine alone arm . IV . Determine compare clinical benefit rate ( CBR ) gemcitabine/VX-970 gemcitabine alone arm . V. Determine compare duration response ( DOR ) gemcitabine/VX-970 gemcitabine alone arm . VI . Determine compare cancer antigen ( CA ) 125 reduction &gt; = 50 % gemcitabine/VX-970 gemcitabine alone arm . VII . Determine compare overall survival ( OS ) gemcitabine/VX-970 gemcitabine alone arm . VIII . Determine ORR subject gemcitabine alone arm cross gemcitabine/VX-970 arm . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 8 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients experience disease progression may crossover Arm II . ARM II : Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride Arm I ATR kinase inhibitor VX-970 IV 60-90 minute day 2 9 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day , every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
