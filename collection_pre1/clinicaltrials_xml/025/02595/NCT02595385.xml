	<brief_title>Blood Conservation Adult Cardiac Surgery , What Way Forward Today 's Practice ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiac surgery major blood consumer . Current evidence show benefit transfusion haematocrit low 21 % risk death within 30 day surgery almost 6 time high patient receive blood . In addition , transfuse patient likely experience increase infection ischaemic complication like myocardial infarction , stroke renal compromise . While agree avoid blood transfusion feasible , current consensus best strategy maintain acceptable haemocrit minimise need allogenic blood transfusion . Two many strategy employ Retrograde Autologous Prime ( RAP ) bypass circuit cell salvage ( CS ) reinfusion shed blood . This study prospective , randomise control trial 240 patient undergoing single procedure adult cardiac surgery randomise either full crystalloid prime volume RAP , without cell salvage . There four study arm ; 1 . RAP alone 2 . Cell Salvage alone 3 . RAP plus cell salvage 4 . Control group Results follow analyse data use logistic regression use design matric blood transfuse key explanatory variable scope add patient covariables . It expect date analyse 100 patient significance achieve study terminate . The study aim identify patient receive blood transfusion intra post-operatively . Symptomatology anaemia subjective hard measure . The study link transfusion cardiac surgery outcomes retrospective ; despite careful risk adjustment , possible association reflect tendency amongst clinician transfuse critically ill patient miss another important confounder . In 2001 , Spiess refer current transfusion practice 'silent epidemic ' . His description still accurate . In 2006 , almost half patient undergoing coronary artery bypass graft united state receive blood transfusion probability receive blood great procedure complex . Although infectious risk blood transfusion successfully minimise weight evidence increasingly suggest transfuse less stable patient could prevent significant amount morbidity mortality . This study help guide management transfusion avoidable .</detailed_description>
