	<detailed_description>Aim Study impulsivity relation different self harm behavior , specifically suicidal attempt , ongoing field study already widely discuss . Yet date , relationship remain unclear somewhat confuse . Possible explanation might due fact impulsivity ill-defined concept lead numerous definition use different study fact trait state aspect . Clinical experience theory lead assumption impulsivity play important role suicide . Novel research field decision making could possibly lead breakthrough improve assessment prevention suicide attempt learn complex relationship . The study obsessive thinking pattern contribution suicide less prominent . In spite lack magnitude research , look underlying mechanism noticeable impulsivity obsessive thinking share common factor congruent many way . Determining nature different obsessive thinking pattern self destructive thought , rumination over-valued idea manifest inner voice crucial two point view : one hand learn relation different pattern , mutual independent effect self harm behavior . On hand , observe complement factor impulsivity may lead good understanding latter . Studying interaction trait impulsivity different obsessive thinking pattern could lead good understand theoretical gap discuss literature review suicidal ideators attempter . Literature proven observe behavioral pattern decision making task could serve good predictor self harm suicidal behavior , compare solely rely self report . The investigator intention try find correlation personality dimension impulsivity obsessive think specific behavioral pattern indicate suicidal self harm behavior . Understanding impulsive obsessive thinking pattern effect self harm behavior `` real life '' situation raise ecological validity aid export research conclusion clinical setting . The investigator research recruit population know feature impulsivity obsessive thinking pattern , Eating Disorders , co-existence proven empirically yet nature interaction fully understood . Eating disorder individual also high risk attempt suicide exhibit self harm behavior general compare non clinical population , make relevant group propose study . The investigator propose impulsive behavior obsessive thinking pattern negative effect performance decision make situation . When tendency make bad decision risk execute different form self harm rise , include suicidal behavior eat disorder . Method : Participants The investigator recruit 100 participant sample female patient , diagnose Eating Disorders suicidal behavior , admit mental health department general psychiatric hospital . Diagnosis make hospital staff . After receive approval medical staff participant interview , hand questionnaire computerized task . Procedure Research consist two part : first investigator conduct preliminary research 20 subject intend decrease questionnaire bandwidth . Analysis item administer correlation indicate unsuitable congruent item remove research . In second part study 100 female participant nominate research . Participants brief research rationale procedure instruct sign inform consent ( parent minor brief instructed sign well ) indicate willingness participate . Following participant administer interview , self report questionnaire computerize task research team . It clarify participant questionnaires anonymous wrong right answer . Participants able handle research demand due physical condition interview research team accordance nature questionnaire .</detailed_description>
