	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well temozolomide capecitabine work compare standard treatment cisplatin etoposide treat patient neuroendocrine carcinoma gastrointestinal tract pancreas spread part body ( metastatic ) remove surgery . Drugs use chemotherapy , temozolomide , capecitabine , cisplatin , etoposide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Certain type neuroendocrine carcinoma may respond good treatment current standard treatment cisplatin etoposide . It yet know whether temozolomide capecitabine may work good cisplatin etoposide treat patient type neuroendocrine carcinoma , call non-small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cisplatin Etoposide Temozolomide Capecitabine Treating Patients With Neuroendocrine Carcinoma Gastrointestinal Tract Pancreas That Is Metastatic Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess progression free survival ( PFS ) cisplatin etoposide versus PFS temozolomide capecitabine patient advanced G3 non-small cell gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine carcinoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess response rate ( RR ) cisplatin etoposide versus RR temozolomide capecitabine patient advanced G3 non-small cell gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine carcinoma . II . To assess overall survival ( OS ) cisplatin etoposide versus OS temozolomide capecitabine patient advanced G3 non-small cell gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine carcinoma . III . To evaluate toxicity associate combination temozolomide capecitabine combination cisplatin etoposide , respectively , patient advance G3 non-small cell gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine carcinoma . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess impact treatment regimen PFS , RR OS base marker proliferation Ki-67 ( Ki-67 ) index patient advance G3 non-small cell gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine carcinoma . ( Laboratory ) II . To assess prognostic significance well differentiate versus poorly differentiate non-small cell gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumor relationship survival response treatment . ( Laboratory ) III . To assess agreement marker proliferation Ki-67 ( Ki-67 ) status report institutional pathologist report central pathology review . ( Laboratory ) OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM A : Patients receive capecitabine orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-14 temozolomide PO daily ( QD ) day 10-14 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM B : Patients receive cisplatin intravenously ( IV ) approximately 30 minute etoposide IV approximately 60 minute day 1-3 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 5 year .</detailed_description>
