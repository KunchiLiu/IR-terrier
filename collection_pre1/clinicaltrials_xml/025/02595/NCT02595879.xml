	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose triapine give radiation therapy cisplatin treat patient stage IB2-IVA cervical vulvar cancer . Triapine may stop growth cancer cell block enzyme need cell growth . Cisplatin drug use chemotherapy kill cancer cell damage deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) stop divide . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell shrink tumor . Adding triapine standard treatment cisplatin radiation therapy may kill cancer cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Triapine With Chemotherapy Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With IB2-IVA Cervical Vulvar Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerable dose ( MTD ) recommend phase II dose ( RP2D ) oral triapine use combination cisplatin plus radiation therapy . II . To determine oral bioavailability triapine . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare pharmacokinetics ( PK ) oral intravenous triapine . II . To determine metabolic complete response ( mCR ) rate oral triapine combination cisplatin chemoradiation use fludeoxyglucose F 18 ( 18F-FDG ) -positron emission tomography ( PET ) compute tomography ( CT ) post-therapy ( 3-months ) . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether overexpression ribonucleotide reductase ( RR ) archival tumor tissue correlate antitumor activity triapine . II . To determine effect combine modality treatment activation ATM serine/threonine kinase ( ATM ) H2A histone family , member X ( H2AX ) possibly marker peripheral blood . OUTLINE : This dose escalation study triapine . Patients undergo pelvic external beam radiation therapy ( EBRT ) intensity modulate radiation therapy ( IMRT ) 5 day per week 5 week ( 25 fraction ) 3-day boost week 6 , 1 3 application low dose rate ( LDR ) brachytherapy week 6 5 fraction high dose rate ( HDR ) brachytherapy week 4 5 . Patients also receive triapine intravenously ( IV ) 2 hour day 1 11 orally ( PO ) day 2-5 , 8-10 , 12 , 15-19 , 22-26 , 29-33 within 90 minute pelvic irradiation , cisplatin IV 90-120 minute weekly 5 week ( day 2 , 9 , 16 , 23 , 30 ) . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 month .</detailed_description>
