	<brief_summary>Background : Genes instruction person body use function . Genome sequence new way look gene main research team use learn cause condition study . When new cause find way , call primary variant . Each person many variant . Most cause disease . Sequencing also find secondary variant . These related condition main research team study , may show person high risk cancer another condition . Researchers want learn mean secondary variant . Objectives : To find new gene change lead certain medical condition . To good understand cause certain disease . To learn people understand genetic test result . Eligibility : People rare disease already consent enrol another protocol run group National Human Genome Research Institute . Design : DNA sample already collect study . Participants may ask send second DNA sample ( blood saliva ) . These use verify finding . If primary variant participant health condition find genome sequencing , share participant primary research team . If participant secondary finding , share phone call videoconference research group National Human Genome Research Institute . Some participant may get result person clinic . Three month get secondary finding , participant online survey phone interview . They ask use information . Some people receive secondary finding genome sequencing ask online survey three month get result . Participants secondary find get genetic counseling .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The implementation genome exome sequencing creates challenge opportunity . We propose pilot implementation exome sequence incidental/secondary finding NIHCC measure perceive utility . Through Clinical Center Genomics Opportunity ( CCGO ) , offer investigator 10 institute access exome sequence gene identification study rare disease patient . We use research resource increase research use genomics outside NHGRI , begin build NIHCC clinical laboratory infrastructure support genome scale data , familiarize clinician NIHCC genomic medicine . To accomplish clinical goal , propose generate exome data CLIA- ( NotEqual ) compliant environment NISC use data evaluate patient presence variant gene recommend American College Medical Genetics Genomics policy incidental secondary finding , consistent policy recommendation Presidential Commission Study Bioethical Issues . Thus , exome data dual purpose entire dataset available research order principal investigator small subset data use test ability identify high risk variant actionable disorder , couple knowledgeable clinical interpretation , genetic counseling referral ongoing care . The human subject review approval gene identification research use exome data address approved PIs IRBs . Here , request review generation sequence data next-gen technology secondary variant , bioinformatic pipeline filtering variant , manual curation variant , behavioral follow participant receive secondary finding result measure utility perceive value . Additional critical Specific Aims measure efficacy communicate 1 ) participant receive secondary finding concept secondary finding analysis substitute indicate single gene 2 ) explore interpretation outcomes result receive secondary finding .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA : English ( NotEqual ) speak participant enrol one approve CCGO application protocol approval IRB secondary variant report available ( positive negative ) . These study include wide range age patient , child adult . For minor decisionallyimpaired adult , one parent/guardian , typically self designate primary health care support parent , enrol . If parent claim equal role , whichever parent select participate interview/survey enrol . It important emphasize ask minor decisionally impaired adult participate social behavioral component study . Because validated instrument survey largely exist language English , administer measure nonEnglish speaker .</criteria>
