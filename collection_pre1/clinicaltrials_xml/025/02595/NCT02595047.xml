	<brief_title>Autologous Prefabrication Body Surface Tissues/ Organs ( e.g . Joint )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In field tissue regeneration technique , vitro process exogenous factor still many uncertainty . These uncertainty hamper road clinical application . As importance vivo environment arouse awareness , investigator validate hypothesis feasibility self-regeneration prefabricate unaided vitro culture process exogenous element .</detailed_description>
