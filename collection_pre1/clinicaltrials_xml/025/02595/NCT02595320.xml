	<brief_title>Capecitabine Metastatic Breast GI Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Goals treatment metastatic breast cancer remain largely comfort care . However , improvement median survival among woman metastatic disease last two decade , mainly due availability effective agent . Women live longer metastatic disease therapy long period time . Therefore , increasingly important effective therapy associate less toxicity woman enjoy good overall quality life . Similar breast cancer , goal treatment various GI malignancy ( include metastatic colorectal cancer , metastatic gastric esophageal cancer , unresectable metastatic pancreatic cancer cholangiocarcinoma ) largely comfort care important minimize toxicity therapy treatment metastatic disease . Capecitabine unique chemotherapeutic agent two reason . It oral chemotherapy drug available treat breast GI malignancy , make convenient patient . In addition , whereas cytotoxic chemotherapy agent administered month time development cumulative toxicity , capecitabine continue many month year toxicity manage . However optimal dose schedule capecitabine know . This basis propose randomize phase II trial compare efficacy tolerability capecitabine 1500 milligram ( mg ) twice day ( BID ) , 7 day 7 day schedule capecitabine 1250 milligrams/meters square ( mg/m2 ) BID , 14 day 7 day ) woman metastatic breast cancer patient advanced/metastatic GI cancer .</detailed_description>
