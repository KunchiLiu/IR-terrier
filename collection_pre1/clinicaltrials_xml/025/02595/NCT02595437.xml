	<brief_title>Triferic Pediatric Pharmacokinetic Protocol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 1/2 , open-label , 2-period , single-dose study assess safety pharmacokinetics ( PK ) Triferic ( ferric pyrophosphate citrate , FPC ) administer via dialysate IV pediatric patient ( &lt; 18 year age ) receive chronic hemodialysis ( CKD-5HD ) . Total participation study approximately three week comprise screen visit , two dosing ( PK ) visit , follow-up visit . Each patient receive single dose Triferic administer IV venous blood return line duration dialysis . At next scheduled dialysis session patient receive single dose Triferic administer via dialysate single hemodialysis session . Blood sample obtain various time analyze serum iron parameter safety .</detailed_description>
