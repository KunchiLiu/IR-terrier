	<detailed_description>Dry eye , keratoconjunctivitis sicca , chronic inflammatory condition ocular surface may cause severe symptom 2007 international dry eye workshop ( DEWS ) define disease follow : `` Dry eye multifactorial disease tear oc symptom discomfort , visual disturbance , tear film instability potential damage ocular surface . It accompany tear film inflammation ocular surface '' . Lubricin mucin-like glycoprotein originally discover synovial fluid , secrete product cell line joint tissue , surface articular cartilage . In vitro study show lubricin saline buffer act lubricant various surface , well synovial fluid , pr lubricin principal lubricate protein joint . Besides lubricate property , lubricin show exert anti-adhesive ac dissipation , protective effect underlie cell . Lubricin investigate role ocular surface , normal pathologic condition dry eye . In fact , Lubricin protein potent lubricant anti-adhesive property present ocular surface meibomian gland . The presence ocular surface first describe team Sullivan D. Based available preclinical study lubricin may important barrier development corneal conjunctival epitheliopathies dry eye use novel lubricate anti-adhesive eye drop investigation clinical investigation . A clinical investigation currently ongoing demonstrate Lubricin 150 µg/ml eye drop formulation non-inferior ocular surface lubricant sodium hyaluronate 0.13 % . Up , know anticipated adverse event associate use lubricin , anyway occurrence side effect It must consider topical treatment lubricin hyaluronic acid could cause local irritation allergic reaction . There ar contraindication use lubricin hyaluronic acid eye drop . All examination assessment carry durin invasive , commonly use management subject dry eye pose risk subject . There know co lubricin hyaluronic acid eye drop . . No data available embryo fetal toxicity , therefore experimental treatment allow pregnant woman nurse mother woman childbearing potential use appropriate birth control method . The objective study evaluate tolerability , safety efficacy Lubricin 150 µg/ml eye drop compare widely use commercial 0.18 % sodium hyaluronate eye drop formulation moderate dry eye patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>To check screen visit ( V1 ) within 7 day study treatment confirm baseline visit ( V2 ) : 1 . Patients 18 year age old . 2 . Patients moderate dry eye characterize least one eye sign symptom moderate dry eye ( grade 2 3 2007 DEWS report ) 3 . Patients diagnose dry eye least 3 month ( current use recommend use artificial tear treatment Dry Eye ) 4 . Average VAS score typical symptom Dry Eye ( foreign body sensation , burning/stinging , itching , pain , stick feeling , blur vision photophobia ) ≥ 25 mm ; 5 . Corneal stain score fluorescein &gt; 3 use Oxford corneal grade system bad perform eye ; 6 . Schirmer test without anaesthesia ≤ 10 mm/5 minute worst perform eye ; 7 . Tear film breakup time ( TBUT ) ≤ 10 second worst perform eye 8 . Best correct distance visual acuity ( BCDVA ) score ≥ 0.1 decimal unit eye time study enrollment . 9 . Only patient satisfy Informed Consent requirement may include study . The patient and/or his/her legal representative must read , sign date Informed Consent document studyrelated procedure perform . The Informed Consent form sign patient and/or legal representative must approve Ethics Committee current study . 1 . Patients mild Dry Eye condition ( severity level 1 accord Report International Dry Eye Workshop DEWS , 2007 ) 2 . Patients severe Dry Eye condition ( severity level 4 accord Report International Dry Eye Workshop DEWS , 2007 ) 3 . Best correct distance visual acuity ( BCDVA ) score &lt; 0.1 decimal unit either eye time study enrolment 4 . Evidence active ocular infection either eye 5 . History presence ocular surface disorder related dry eye either eye 6 . Use ocular topical medication study medication treatment ocular disease include artificial tear study period 7 . Use topical cyclosporine , topical corticosteroid topical medication treatment dry eye either eye within 30 day study enrolment 8 . History ocular surgery ( include laser refractive surgical procedure ) either eye within 90 day study enrolment . Ocular surgery allow study treatment period elective ocular surgery procedure plan duration followup period 9 . Presence history ocular systemic disorder condition might significantly hinder efficacy study treatment evaluation , could possibly interfere interpretation study result , could judge investigator incompatible study visit schedule conduct trail procedure ( e.g . ocular trauma , progressive degenerative corneal condition , uveitis , systemic infection . ) 10 . Known hypersensitivity one component study procedural medication 11 . Participation another clinical study time present study within 90 day screening/baseline visit 12 . History drug , medication alcohol abuse addiction . 13 .
