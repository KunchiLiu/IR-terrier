	<brief_summary>The use optic nerve sheath diameter ( ONSD ) measurement non invasive test raise ICP many potential benefit . This include assessment make bedside instead require patient transport CT MRI , cause rise ICP . If ONSD represent acute sensitive measurement elevate ICP , may prove useful emergency department ( ED ) set evaluation shunt use cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) diversion . The investigator hypothesize ONSD correlate measure ICP thus reliable tool bedside assessment ICP . The investigator hypothesize ONSD change correlate change ICP , make useful bedside tool assess ICP change time . This prospective , observational study use convenience sample . Children 0 - 18 year old invasive intracranial ICP monitoring device admit hospital Pediatric Intensive Care Unit ( PICU ) eligible participation study . Children 0-18 year old determine require shunt revision follow evaluation ED also include study . 10 . After invasive intracranial pressure monitoring device place , every recruited patient , ONSD measurements take ICP record 8 hour post placement repeat 3 time day intracranial pressure monitoring device removed.12 . For ventriculoperitoneal ( VP ) shunt revision patient , investigator obtain measurement surgery , immediately post-op , 12 hour , 24 hour , 36 hour post-op . If patient otherwise ready discharge prior 36 hour , measurement may omit do early unnecessarily prolong hospitalization</brief_summary>
