	<brief_summary>1 . Purpose Objective : The purpose study test feasibility rapid acquisition point care 3D ultrasound pediatric appendicitis . The study use newly develop acquisition method post-processing technique create three dimensional image model abdomen . 2 . Study activity population group . The study population convenience sample patient 18 year younger suspect appendicitis , whose clinical care ( unrelated study ) include ultrasound and/or CT abdomen . The study intervention include acquisition research ultrasound image , use clinical care , comparison image clinically obtain image . Other clinical data surgical pathology report also review . If evident patient medical record , final diagnosis confirm telephone call subject 2 week initial visit . 3 . Data analysis risk/safety issue . This pilot study intend determine feasibility refine image reconstruction algorithm . Research image compare clinical image determine frequency visualization appendix whether appendix deem normal abnormal . Comparison research image final diagnosis also occur . The research intervention , ultrasound exam , know safety risk . The risk subject loss confidentiality . This study observational , interventional , experimental ultrasound perform subject use clinical care patient ( consequently , opportunity affect clinical outcome ) . Experimental image review completion clinical care provide clinician care subject . We measure effect ultrasound examination subject ' outcome .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Potential subject must 018 year age , present pediatric emergency department evaluation right low abdominal pain suspect appendicitis . The clinical diagnostic plan subject enrollment must include abdominal ultrasound and/or abdominal CT. Because ultrasound involve use ionize radiation contrast agent , contraindicate patient , although image quality may nondiagnostic obese patient . The focus study acquisition research 3D POC US image determine feasibility use pediatric patient suspect appendicitis . Patients BMI &gt; 30 mass &gt; 70kg , patient anticipate nondiagnostic ultrasound image . Ultrasound also require gel material apply skin surface acoustic transmission medium . Allergy gel exclusion criterion .</criteria>
