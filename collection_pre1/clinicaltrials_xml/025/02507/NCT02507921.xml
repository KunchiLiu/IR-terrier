	<brief_summary>The investigator aim assess type frequency HIV drug resistance adult present Infectious Diseases Institute ( IDI ) Kampala , Uganda , compare data patient Swiss HIV Cohort Study ( SHCS ) . This study single-site , cross-sectional study . The Investigators ' goal perform viral load measurement 2750 HIV-infected patient ART 6 month . Presuming detectable viral load 10 % , resistance test would perform 250 patient ART . All adult patient attend screened enrollment . Furthermore , investigator ' goal perform resistance test 250 ART naive patient order detect transmit resistance mutation . Investigators therefore consecutively screen enroll 250 ART naive patient attend clinic study period . For participant , case report form ( CRF ) form complete include social , well medical information . Investigators ask participant permission store plasma case resistance test must repeat , serum , case future research question .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background &amp; Rational Uganda Switzerland two example region world experience era antiretroviral treatment ( ART ) substantially different way . While European patient access ART begin drug development , ART make accessible patient sub-Saharan Africa many year later . HIV-infected patient resource-limited setting subject early day treatment , mono therapy try combination drug market nowadays . Furthermore , contrast European patient , patient resource-limited setting constantly confront economic constraint lead stock-outs instance . Cultural aspect , stigma fear disclosure , differ well , well know influence individual adherence treatment outcome substantially . Today similar first-line treatment choice make Ugandan Swiss physician , monitoring strategy still differ . As country sub-Saharan Africa , treatment HIV-infected patient monitor immunologically clinically , viral load measurement reserve select patient . In accordance WHO recommendations treatment failure therefore determine clinically ( new recurrent WHO stage III IV condition ) and/or decline patient 's CD4 cell count baseline , usually occur late insufficient treatment . Viral rebound emergence resistance may thereby arise . Moreover , misclassification treatment failure ( e.g . patient immunological failure absence virological failure complete non-adherence treatment ) may result premature switch costly second-line treatment option . The currently available information transmit drug resistance ( TDR ) Ugandan adult show low rate compare patient European country , include Switzerland . Yet , available study conduct small patient number . Newer data Uganda , especially new WHO treatment recommendation , available yet . To best investigator ' knowledge , far study directly compare HIV drug resistance data resource-limited country resource-rich country . Little known effect historically , culturally economically different ART experience resistance . With 2013 WHO guideline , ART roll-out enhance globally continued success large-scale treatment program depend prevention emergence drug resistance . Study Design : Cross-sectional , single-site , observational Enrolment period : May 1st - July 31st 2015 Patients : All HIV-infected adult age 18 year stable first- second-line ART regimen ≥6 month present Infectious Diseases Institute ( IDI ) study period able give write informed consent enrol . The goal perform viral load test 2750 patient ART . Presuming detectable viral load 10 % , resistance test would perform 250 patient ART . Treatment naive HIV-infected patient age 18 year present IDI study period offer resistance testing . The goal perform resistance test 250 ART naive patient . Laboratory test : A blood sample use resistance test treatment naive patient . For patient ART , initial sample use HIV viral load measurement IDI . Part sample frozen ( -80°C ) store IDI later resistance test case detectable viral load ( plasma viral load &gt; 1000 copies/ml ) . Resistance test do Ugandan Virus Research Institute ( UVRI ) Entebbe , Uganda . Statistical Methods : Type frequency mutation treatment-naive identified compare data SHCS . Investigators compare treatment-naive patient SHCS test time-frame ( year 2014 ) . Additionally , investigator identify time-frame SHCS similar proportion patient detectable viral load ART Uganda ( time-frame depend finding Uganda ) . Uni- multivariate logistic regression perform identify risk factor detection HIV drug resistance mutation . Type frequency mutation treatment-experienced patient also analyze compare patient SHCS . For comparison , investigator match patient SHCS age , gender ART . To identify risk factor detection mutation treatment-experienced patient , investigator also perform logistic regression model . To study diagnostic performance clinical/immunological testing investigator calculate sensitivity , specificity , positive negative predictive value compare virological testing ( gold standard ) . These analysis perform drug-resistance mutation pool together ( outcome-variable= patient drug resistance mutation ) , drug resistance mutation individual drug class ( outcome = patient drug resistance mutation particular drug class ) , two resistance mutation ( M184V K103N ) prevalent previous study resource-limited setting .</detailed_description>
