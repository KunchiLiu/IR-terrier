	<brief_title>Tolerability , Safety , Activity SRX246 Irritable Subjects With Huntington 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SRX246 first-in-class vasopressin 1a ( V1a ) receptor antagonist cross blood-brain barrier follow oral administration . The molecule exhibit high affinity high selectivity target receptor . Preclinical pharmacology study demonstrate significant CNS effect model irritability , include impulsive aggression , depression , anxiety . In experimental medicine fMRI study healthy volunteer , SRX246 treatment significantly attenuate effect intranasal AVP brain circuit know modulate emotional response stimuli elicit aggression/fear . Together , finding suggest SRX246 potential novel therapeutic agent major neuropsychiatric symptom see HD patient . This 3-arm , multicenter , randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blind , 12 week , dose escalation study SRX246 irritable Subjects early symptomatic HD . Following initial screen visit , Subjects fulfil study inclusion exclusion criterion enter pre-treatment screen phase permit evaluation confirm eligibility inclusion study . This screen phase longer 30 day . At completion screen period , eligible Subjects randomize baseline visit receive either placebo final dos SRX246 120 mg twice daily 160 mg twice daily double-blind treatment phase . At baseline , Subjects active group receive 80 mg twice daily 2 week , escalate 120 mg twice daily 4 week . Then one group Subjects continue take 120 mg SRX246 twice daily additional 6 week , second group Subjects increase dose 160 mg SRX246 twice daily 6 week . Total dose duration 12 week . Subjects placebo group receive similar number capsule identical appearance capsule contain SRX246 trial , order preserve blind . In group , dose escalation occur ( stepwise ) patient experience dose-limiting adverse effect . Patients tolerate final dose drug ( placebo ) dose reduce without compromise blinding . Subjects periodic visit either `` in-person '' `` telephone '' , assess tolerability , safety , several measure irritability problem behavior , clinical assessment activity signal .</detailed_description>
