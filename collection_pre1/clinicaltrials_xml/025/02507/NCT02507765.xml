	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) transarterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) treat patient liver cancer remove surgery . SBRT specialized radiation therapy delivers high dose radiation directly tumor may kill tumor cell cause less damage normal tissue . Chemoembolization kill tumor cell carry drug directly blood vessel near tumor block blood flow allow high concentration drug reach tumor long period time . SBRT may make TACE beneficial increase blood flow tumor , may allow TACE chemotherapy enter tumor . Giving SBRT TACE may work well treat patient liver cancer remove surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To establish feasibility complete SBRT follow TACE 2 day time period . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine acute tumor perfusion change SBRT use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) ( magnetic resonance [ MR ] -dynamic contrast enhance [ DCE ] /perfusion weight image [ PWI ] , MR-diffusion , blood oxygen level dependent [ BOLD ] sequence ) . II . To establish safety tolerability regimen . III . To determine overall response rate ( use modify Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors [ RECIST ] criterion ) , include objective response rate ( partial response [ PR ] + complete response [ CR ] ) clinical benefit rate ( stable disease [ SD ] + PR + CR ) 1 , 3 , 6 month TACE . IV . To evaluate local control , progression-free survival , overall survival 1 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 month single-dose SBRT follow TACE . V. To correlate micro ribonucleic acid ( miRNA ) biomarkers response toxicity . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study SBRT . Patients undergo SBRT day 1 TACE day 2 . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1-2 week 1 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 18 , 24 month .</detailed_description>
