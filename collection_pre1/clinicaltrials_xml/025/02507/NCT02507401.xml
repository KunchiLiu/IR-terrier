	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether mix microbial specie isolate biofilm-clogged voice prosthesis specific participant , whether microbes orally-derived whether presence specific specie predictor frequency patient discard device due malfunction . The microbe isolate discarded device use test antimicrobial property newly-developed medical silicone .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study three primary objective one secondary objective : Primary Objectives - To understand variation composition mixed-species biofilms voice prosthesis , patient time within patient . This enable u target resistance specific microbe use chemistry-based approach design new medical silicone develop realistic vitro model use relevant clinical isolates test . - To explore association incidence specific microbe biofilms , patient factor ( use antimicrobial , antacid denture ) , increase device-replacement frequency . - To explore whether colonise microbe originate participant 's oral flora . Secondary Objective â€¢ To study interaction occur within social group microbe isolate voice prosthesis learn ) whether specie interdependent , b ) whether cooperate order build biofilms b ) species produce compound physically degrade medical polymer . STUDY DESIGN Four hypothesis address study : 1 . There correlation presence certain microbe , mix microbe , frequency device replacement ; 2 . The source problem microbes participant 's oral flora ; 3 . Participant-related factor continuous exposure microbes antimicrobial antacid treatment , use denture , may alter composition device biofilms . 4 . Identification problem microbe may assist development new medical silicone specifically design resist specie . These hypothesis address collection discard device participant user voice prosthesis register Speech Voice Clinic , Aberdeen Royal Infirmary ( 27 people ) . Participants request donate discard device , mouthwash sample simple data recent antimicrobial antacid treatment , use denture . The microbes colonising prosthesis contain within mouthwash sample isolate identified association microbial specie patient data time analyse . Microbes store clinical isolates use test biofilm establishment maintenance silicone modify surface design reduce biofouling .</detailed_description>
