	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study isolate limb perfusion melphalan treat patient stage IIIB-IV melanoma sarcoma . Drugs use chemotherapy , melphalan , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Heating chemotherapy solution infuse directly artery around tumor may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Isolated Limb Perfusion With Melphalan Treating Patients With Stage IIIB-IV Melanoma Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . This prospective trial evaluate total response rate , include complete partial response , patient unresectable extremity melanoma ( skin cancer include limited Merkel cell carcinoma ) soft tissue sarcoma treat hyperthermic-isolated limb perfusion ( ILP ) melphalan . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate technical parameter include achievement regional hyperthermia , arterial blood gas ( ABG ) , tourniquet time , association tumor response . II . To evaluate time recurrence progression free survival ( PFS ) patient advanced extremity melanoma sarcoma achieve complete response treatment ILP melphalan . III . To evaluate overall survival rate duration survival patient advance melanoma sarcoma limited extremity undergo ILP melphalan . IV . To assess quality life ( QOL ) score patient undergo ILP melphalan . OUTLINE : Patients undergo ILP melphalan intravenously ( IV ) 60 minute . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 4 month 1 year , periodically thereafter .</detailed_description>
