	<detailed_description>Background Surgical procedure upper gastrointestinal cancer ( UGC ) induce considerable risk morbidity mortality , half UGC patient die within one year diagnosis . Radical surgery crucial survival , associate high risk complication contribute poor long-term prognosis . Despite advance surgical technique perioperative management , postoperative complication frequently occur . An essential part gastrointestinal cancer surgery reconstruction digestive tract form gut-to-gut reconnection , anastomosis . Especially UGC surgery reconstructive anastomosis high risk insufficient heal thus leak intestinal content surround tissue , cause life-threatening infection . Development measure reduce perioperative complication vulnerable patient therefore vital importance Patients undergoing surgery UGC subject substantial trauma reaction term surgical stress response ( SSR ) . SSR characterize activation sympathetic nervous system , endocrine system , well immunological hematological response lead hypotension , systemic local inflammation . In addition , surgical stress cause immunosuppression response complex interaction various hormone , cytokine acute phase reactant . Furthermore , recently report perioperative immunosuppression increase incidence cancer recurrence , growth metastasis reduce survival . A contributing factor SSR , possibly importantly , rate postoperative complication , may mesenteric traction syndrome ( MTS ) . MTS arise organ abdomen manipulate surgery . One main symptom substantial circulatory change ( hypotension , tachycardia subsequent flushing ) , potentially lead surgical complication . Hypothesis aim It hypothesis project Mesenteric Traction Syndrome ( MTS ) common event UGC-surgery induction syndrome important factor provoke peri- postoperative complication worsen SSR . In order uncover role MTS cancer surgery effect oncological patient , aim project : To characterize MTS patient undergoing three common form UGC surgery use new objective methodology record biomarkers suspect play role pathophysiology MTS postoperative development complication . Methods 75 patient undergoing UGC surgery ( 25 three common cancer type UGC ) include . This study use novel skin flush measure method call laser speckle contrast imaging ( LSCI ) measure skin blood flow forehead . LSCI real-time non-touch measuring device capable measuring blood flow large field surface ( 15 cm x 20 cm ) . In parallel , inflammatory hormonal stress biomarkers consider associated SSR , measure . In study , hypothesize , correlate new method quantifiable flushing measurement know biomarkers , possible relate extent flush severity hypotension MTS proxy extent complication . Furthermore , participant expose head tilt three pre define time point subsequent monitoring haemodynamics SSR . This intervention do assess patient ' fluid status end surgery well postoperatively , hypovolemia associate postoperative complication . Statistics The incidence MTS UGC patient previously unknown power calculation perform base previous report case MTS abdominal surgery ( incidence 30 % 85 % ) . 15 patient require group order obtain statistical power great 0.90 Î±-level &lt; 0.05 , . Groups 25 patient therefore chosen ensure statistical significance .</detailed_description>
