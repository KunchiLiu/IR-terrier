	<brief_summary>The purpose project test hypothesis Speed Information Processing ( SIP ) deficit acquire brain injury ( ABI ) remediate . The majority individual acquire brain injury speed information processing deficit part cognitive sequela brain injury . Empirical research expect demonstrate efficacy computerize cognitive Speed Information Processing ( SIP ) training individual ABI . Study participant ask attend two study visit course approximately 13 week . Participants randomly assign either experimental control group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The specific aim current research protocol follow : Aim 1 : To test hypothesis SIP training individual ABI improve process speed . This study expect demonstrate individual ABI receive SIP training improve neurocognitive measure process speed . Aim 2 : To test generalizability SIP training individual TBI cognitive domains beyond information processing speed . This study expect demonstrate increase work memory , attention executive function group receive cognitive training . Aim 3 : To test hypothesis SIP training individual TBI improve mood . This study expect demonstrate self-reported level depression improve group receive cognitive training . Aim 4 : To examine change neural integrity white matter pathway brain occur individual undergo SIP training . All participant undergo set baseline cognitive exams/tests , take approximately two hour . Participants randomly place either experimental group control group . The experimental group undergo approximately 40 hour train Brain Fitness Program eight week period . The control group contact week eight week cognitively stimulate activity ( i.e . reading , work computer , puzzle ) . At approximately thirteenth week participant group undergo post-baseline cognitive exams/tests . This evaluation take approximately two hour . In addition optional neuroimaging study participant may elect participate . Participants agree take part neuroimaging portion study undergo baseline MRI scan . At approximately 13 week later participant undergo post-baseline MRI scan . Both scan take approximately one hour .</detailed_description>
