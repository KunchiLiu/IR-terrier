	<brief_title>Regional Versus General Anesthesia Promoting Independence After Hip Fracture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hip fracture clinical condition involve break femur ( hip bone ) near attache pelvis . Hip fracture occur 300,000 time year US 1.6 million time year worldwide . Over 90 % hip fracture occur individual age 50 old , commonly result low-energy traumatic injury , fall stand context establish osteoporosis , chronic illness , disability . Surgical treatment , via fixation fracture bone partial total replacement hip joint , indicate type hip fracture approximately 95 % hip fracture patient undergo surgery . No evidence-based intervention exist improve functional outcome hip fracture surgery beyond immediate postoperative period . Nearly hip fracture patient require orthopedic surgery anesthesia , make anesthetic care episode major opportunity impact outcomes . Spinal general anesthesia represent two standard care approach anesthesia hip fracture surgery . Basic clinical research identify multiple plausible mechanism spinal anesthesia may improve outcome hip fracture ; nonetheless , major guideline systematic review identify key evidence gap anesthesia care hip fracture vary markedly practice . While spinal general anesthesia hip fracture previously compare retrospective study small randomized trial , much available prospective trial data old may reflective current clinical practice . REGAIN first pragmatic multicenter prospective randomize trial spinal versus general anesthesia hip fracture surgery design evaluate association anesthesia technique functional recovery hip fracture . As , fill critical evidence gap inform policy practice .</detailed_description>
