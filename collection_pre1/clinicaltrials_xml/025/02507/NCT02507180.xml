	<brief_title>Safely Ruling Out Deep Vein Thrombosis Pregnancy With LEFt Clinical Decision Rule D-Dimer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>VTE lead cause maternal death develop world . Suspected DVT pregnancy common clinical problem face clinician daily . The validated method exclude DVT pregnancy require leg vein CUS imaging . This imaging modality costly limited availability ( available radiology department , usually , weekday daytime hour ) often necessitating referral emergency room initiation heparin injection leg vein CUS obtain . A simple seemingly powerful clinical decision rule ( LEFt ) simple blood test ( D-dimer ) may promise exclude DVT pregnancy without need diagnostic imaging . Validating safety simple , non-invasive , widely available approach suspect DVT pregnancy would important advance maternal health . A prospective cohort diagnostic management study pregnant woman suspect DVT , three-month follow-up symptomatic VTE take place multiple centre Canada . After obtain informed consent , patient LEFt clinical decision rule apply attend physician D-Dimer testing ( D-Dimer result test perform within 24 hour accept need repeat ) . Patients `` unlikely '' LEFt score 0 1 point negative D-dimer undergo diagnostic imaging . Patients either `` likely '' LEFt score 2 3 point positive D-dimer undergo either single complete leg vein compression ultrasound ( CCUS ) ( Day 1 ) serial proximal leg vein ( CUS ) ( Day 1 Day 7 ) . All patient follow 3 month symptomatic VTE .</detailed_description>
