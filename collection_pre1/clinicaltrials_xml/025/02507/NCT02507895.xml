	<brief_summary>Currently process stroke recovery slow majority treatment focus around physical therapy . Among many method employ facilitate recovery stroke , use motor imagery ( MI ) training may beneficial towards stroke rehabilitation . In current study , propose 2 aim . Our first aim determine feasibility efficacy novel brain-computer interface-assisted MI train program ( BCI-MI ) patient chronic ischemic stroke . This design proof-of-concept study require single-session trial . If patient successfully activate BCI-MI system without much difficulty , second aim enroll patient 4-week train program use BCI-MI . Both functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) do determine effect 4-week training program . Subjects may potentially see improvement walk gait preliminary data previous study demonstrate positive result .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In first study , propose 20 subject sustain first ever haemorrhagic ischaemic subcortical stroke lower limb impairment 9 month prior study enrollment . Subjects recruit exist patient study physician 's cohort patient referral attend physician . During initial screen visit , ascertain subject fulfills criterion participation inform consent obtain study staff . Subjects fully brief detail regard experimental procedure , risk benefit involve responsibility study . Once consent provide , subject undergo MI-BCI usability session , seat comfortably front computer screen . An EEG cap comfortably worn head subject record EEG trace activate cortical area . Subjects instruct perform mental imagery task whereby imagine walk properly affect leg . The accuracy classify correct motor imagery idle condition EEG record subject . Subjects obtain accuracy 57.5 % consider eligible MI-BCI training program . Subjects eligible MI-BCI training undergo series functional assessment , include ( 1 ) functional clinical measure ( 10 meter walk test Up-to-Go test ) , ( 2 ) gait analysis , ( 3 ) cortical activity assessment use TMS , ( 4 ) MRI DTI scan . ( 5 ) Psychological test include Beck Depression Inventory , fatigue severity scale , digital span test . Before start MI-BCI training , subject undergo one MI-BCI session calibration , perform totally BCI usability session gather valuable data analyze . After finish 5 assessment MI-BCI calibration session , MI-BCI training start frequency 3 time week last 4 week . The procedure MI-BCI training identical one BCI usability session except cartoon character computer screen activate walk forward subject successfully perform accurate mental imagery . Subjects undergo MI-BCI training require perform 160 trial MI altogether assign rest period ( 5 min ) every 40 trial . Each session last approximate 45 minute exclude set-up time . The number time subject successfully perform MI task ease able perform task record . Distinct brain signal event-related desynchronization synchronization ( ERD/ERS ) detectable EEG real imagine motor movement healthy subject . Using technique , MI-BCI , translate imagination movement online command , provide promising neural communication system stroke patient suffer motor disability . We previously collaborate I2R-A*STAR BCI design custom-built BCI software sync EEG amplifier . We demonstrate efficacy custom-built MI-BCI device upper limb stroke impairment , therefore , procedure equipment use keep identical except software interface , show cartoon character screen . Subjects undergo five assessment end 4-week 's MI-BCI training 4-6 week last session MI-BCI training , respectively , include ( 1 ) functional clinical outcome measure ( 10 meter walk test Up-to-Go test ) , ( 2 ) gait analysis , ( 3 ) cortical activity assessment use TMS , ( 4 ) MRI DTI . ( 5 ) Psychological test include Beck Depression Inventory , fatigue severity scale , digital span test . The timed up-and-go test measurement mobility . It include number task stand seat position , walking , turn , stop , sit . For test , person ask stand standard chair walk distance approximately 3 meter , turn around walk back chair sit . The 10 meter walk test test walk speed . Timed up-to-go test 10 meter walk test assess certified physical therapist train research staff , take approximate 30 minute include set-up time . Gait analysis systematic study locomotion . It perform NUH , certify medical technician train research staff . Subjects require wear short whole trial process might video-recorded future analyze quality subject ' movement ( face capture consent obtain advance ) . Markers might wear various point reference body iliac spine pelvis , ankle malleolus , condyles knee . Electromyography ( EMG ) sensor might wear area quadriceps femoris , hamstring , gastrocnemius tibialis anterior muscle leg . Gait parameters temporal spatial measure joint kinematics record subject walking along walkway force platform , accord instruction medical technician train research staff . Each session last approximate 1 hour include set-up time . TMS perform investigate mechanism train cortical plasticity indexed cortical excitability change . For MEP study , initially adjust TMS intensity achieve baseline MEP tibialis anterior muscle leg 1 mV peak-to-peak amplitude intervention . Stimulation intensity keep constant subject throughout study . The MEPs record computer off-line analysis . We record 10 MEPs time average peak-to-peak amplitude . For paired pulse stimulation , first subthreshold conditioning stimulus apply , follow variable interstimulus interval ( ISI ) , second suprathreshold stimulus . We use follow ISIs - 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 9 , 10 , 12 , 15 m . The percentage change ISI treatment calculate MEPs therefore important measure change intracortical facilitation inhibition . Each session last approximate 1 hour include set-up time . MRI/DTI scan perform CIRC , NUS . Prior scan , patient brief test procedure safety aspect . A medically-trained physician standby throughout procedure . All participant scan 3-T GE scanner use standard radiofrequency head coil . Head motion minimize foam pad forehead-restraining strap . A T1-weighted high-resolution scan set axial fluid attenuate inversion recovery image acquire . T1-weighted fluid attenuate inversion recovery image realign spatially normalized image isotropic voxel size implement Matlab . Each session last approximate 1 hour include set-up time . A research staff administer Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI ) , Fatigue Severity Scale ( FSS ) , forward backward digit span control confound effect cognitive improvement study .</detailed_description>
