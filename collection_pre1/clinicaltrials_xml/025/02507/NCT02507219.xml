	<brief_summary>The aim project determine whether acute oral administration Ibuprofen change activation pattern amygdala brain structure functional magnetic resonance imaging . The investigator use double-blind , randomize , repeated-measures design . Each 20 healthy control subject test three time receive placebo , 200 mg 600 mg dose ibuprofen p.o . The study consist 4 session : baseline screen session 3 testing session schedule 1-2 week apart . Each individual undergo multi-level assessment base RDoC approach consist ( ) standardize diagnostic assessment , ( b ) self-report questionnaire assess positive negative valence domain well interoception , ( c ) behavioral task assess reward-related processing , avoidance , aversive processing , cognition , interoception ; ( ) physiological measurement consist facial emotion expression monitoring , heart rate respiration , ( e ) functional magnetic resonance image focus reward-related processing , fear conditioning extinction , cognitive inhibition , interoceptive processing , ( f ) biomarker assessment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Occasional OTC nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) use prevalent United States ( 25 % aspirin , 9 % ibuprofen , 2 % naproxen ) . An estimated 36 million Americans use over-the-counter ( OTC ) analgesic daily , however , consider widespread use analgesic agent , overall incidence serious drug-drug interaction involve agent relatively low . Neuroinflammatory mechanism implicate depression , NSAIDs find effective animal model depression monotherapy use augment antidepressant drug . However , result NSAIDs mixed human observational study , good bad depression outcomes report . In animal study , mice inject BCG show increase total immobility time force swim test ( FST ) tail suspension test ( TST ) increase cerebral PGE2 NO level . Ibuprofen decrease total immobility time FST TST decrease cerebral PGE2 NO level , comparable fluoxetine 's effect . This would suggest ibuprofen might antidepressant effect inhibition PGE2 NO production . Some study demonstrate success augmentation antidepressant therapy nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) decrease depressive symptom . However , little known benefit NSAID therapy depressive symptom . In recent meta-analysis , use multivariable regression analysis detectable effect lower PHQ-9 score ibuprofen naproxen group ( -0.31 ) Celebrex group ( -0.61 ) ( p= .0390 ) observe . However , study cognitively normal volunteer age 70 old family history Alzheimer-like dementia randomly assign receive celecoxib 200 mg twice daily , naproxen sodium 220 mg twice daily , placebo investigator find treatment effect geriatric depression score time subgroup participant significant depressive symptom baseline . Moreover , concern anti-inflammatory drug inhibit antidepressant effect SSRIs . In publish fMRI study , ten healthy subject underwent double-blind , placebo-controlled , randomize , cross-over phFMRI study somatosensory painful stimulation right median nerve . These author report task-related increase BOLD signal drug placebo primary somatosensory area middle frontal gyrus relate change subjective pain score . Thus evidence ibuprofen influence BOLD response specific pain-related brain area . Taken together , mixed evidence effect ibuprofen mood data effect emotion circuitry . Hypotheses : 1 . The activation pattern amygdala risk-taking decision-making attenuate ibuprofen dose dependent manner . 2 . The activation pattern amygdala anticipatory emotional arousal attenuate ibuprofen dose dependent manner . 3 . The activation pattern amygdala emotional face processing attenuate ibuprofen dose dependent manner . 4 . The behavioral response task assess emotional cognitive process include positive negative valence reward base learning modulate ibuprofen dose dependent manner .</detailed_description>
