	<criteria>1 . Tumor eligibility : Histologically confirm advanced malignancy refractory standard care therapy , standard care therapy available . 2 . Solid tumor must measurable evaluable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST v. 1.1 ) . Target lesion previously irradiate consider measurable ( lesion ) unless increase size observe follow completion radiation therapy . Leukemia , lymphomas multiple myeloma must measurable disease per response criterion . 3 . Female male , 18 year age old . 4 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 2 . Resolution acute toxic effect prior therapy surgical procedure grade 1 ( except alopecia ) . 5 . Adequate organ function define follow criterion : Serum aspartate transaminase ( AST ) serum alanine transaminase ( ALT ) ≤3 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) , AST ALT ≤5 x ULN liver function abnormality due underlie malignancy Total serum bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN ( except patient document Gilbert 's syndrome ) Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; = 1500/µL Platelets &gt; = 90,000/µL Hemoglobin &gt; = 9.0 g/dL Serum creatinine ≤2.0 x ULN 6 . Signed date informed consent document indicate patient ( legally acceptable representative ) inform pertinent aspect trial prior enrollment . 7 . Willingness ability comply schedule visit , treatment plan , laboratory test , study procedure . Patients present follow included trial : 1 . Major surgery , radiation therapy , systemic anticancer therapy within 4 week start study treatment . 2 . Prior highdose chemotherapy require hematopoietic stem cell rescue except patient lymphoma myeloma . 3 . Current treatment another clinical trial . 4 . Brain metastasis , spinal cord compression , carcinomatous meningitis , leptomeningeal disease unless appropriately treat neurologically stable least 4 week . 5 . Any follow within 12 month prior start study treatment : myocardial infarction , severe/unstable angina , coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft , congestive heart failure , cerebrovascular accident include transient ischemic attack ; within 6 month prior start study treatment pulmonary embolus . However , upon agreement investigator sponsor , 6 month posteventfree period patient pulmonary embolus waive due advanced cancer . Appropriate treatment anticoagulant permit . 6 . Hypertension control medication ( &gt; 150/100 mmHg despite optimal medical therapy ) . 7 . Current treatment therapeutic dos warfarin ( low dose warfarin 2 mg Per oral ( PO ) daily deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis allow ) . 8 . Known human immunodeficiency virus infection . 9 . Pregnancy breastfeed . Female patient must surgically sterile postmenopausal , must agree use effective contraception period therapy . All female patient reproductive potential must negative pregnancy test ( serum urine ) prior enrollment . Male patient must surgically sterile must agree use effective contraception period therapy . The definition effective contraception base judgment principal investigator designate associate . 10 . Other severe acute chronic medical psychiatric condition laboratory abnormality would impart , judgment investigator and/or sponsor , excess risk associate study participation study drug administration , would make patient inappropriate entry study .</criteria>
