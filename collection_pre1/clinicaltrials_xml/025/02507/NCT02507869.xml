	<brief_summary>Despite awareness benefit engage regular physical activity , least 50 % adult US meet recommend guideline physical activity . One potential explanation lack regular physical activity people often experience exercise affectively unpleasant . Evidence suggest positively people experience exercise ( i.e. , good feel exercise ) , likely engage regular physical activity . This may especially true people poor cardiorespiratory condition . In randomized trial , investigator compare effect affect-guided exercise prescription ( intervention ) heart rate-guided exercise prescription ( control ) change physical activity minute among previously underactive adult . Investigators also test whether effect intervention moderate difference cardiorespiratory fitness .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial Affect-Guided Physical Activity Prescription</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Regular physical activity many benefit overall health well-being , current public health guideline recommend least 150 minute per week moderate-to-vigorous intensity activity attain benefit . Despite many benefit regular activity , majority adult US fail meet recommendation regular physical activity . One potential explanation suboptimal level physical activity exercise often experience affectively unpleasant . Recent work demonstrate positive people feel exercise , likely engage regular physical activity . Affective response exercise modulate intensity activity : vigorous intensity , affective response almost uniformly negative unpleasant , whereas moderate intensity , inter-individual variability affective response . Whether intensity exercise self-selected impose also influence affective response exercise , self-selected intensity experience pleasant . Current recommendation engage physical activity focus type training intensity likely result negative affective response . The purpose pilot trial test effect exercise prescription focus maintenance positive affect exercise . Investigators randomize participant one two exercise prescription condition : ( 1 ) affect-guided prescription focus maintain positive affective response ( intervention ) , ( 2 ) heart rate-guided prescription focus maintain moderate intensity ( control ) . Investigators test effect two exercise prescription change subsequent physical activity one week one month among sample underactive adult . Investigators also test whether effect intervention moderate difference cardiorespiratory fitness .</detailed_description>
