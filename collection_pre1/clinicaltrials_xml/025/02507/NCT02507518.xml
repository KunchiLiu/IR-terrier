	<brief_summary>Non small cell lung cancer first cause cancer relate death France become increase health problem develop country . Recently patient progression disease first line chemotherapy , new therapy validate maintenance ( bevacizumab ) switch maintenance treatment ( erlotinib , pemetrexed ) improve survival . Until , determination efficiency treatment base morphological response ( RECIST ) remain inappropriate cytostatic drug anatomical lesion modification . Nuclear Medicine especially 18-FDG Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) offer biologically relevant tool assessment tumour response therapy . The assumption study FDG PET would allow earlier detect lack response , thereafter , modify ineffective treatment . Indeed , nowadays treatment maintain evidence progression disease . However , despite increase use FDG PET predict therapeutic response , validate criterion judge response maintenance therapy non-small cell lung cancer . It seem necessary determine standardize criterion response , early course maintenance therapy patient non small cell lung cancer . The final aim optimize survival adapt metabolic imaging guide therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Role PET Scan Evaluation Early Response Maintenance Treatment Advanced Non-small-cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study optimize survival adapt metabolic image therapy patient advance non-small cell lung cancer . The primary objective study evaluate role SUV metabolic volume measure FDG PETScan early prediction treatment response . 80 patient include 2 year . They follow one year monitoring progression free survival .</detailed_description>
