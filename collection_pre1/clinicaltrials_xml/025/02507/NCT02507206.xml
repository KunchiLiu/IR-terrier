	<brief_summary>The purpose study examine effect administration drug call DAR-0100A attention memory person schizotypal personality disorder ( SPD ) . DAR-0100A FDA approve , however recent study use treat cognitive deficit , mean problem way organize thinking , people diagnose schizophrenia . Many people carry diagnosis schizotypal personality disorder trouble attention memory . Increasing presence brain chemical call dopamine find help people schizophrenia attention memory problem . This study investigate whether true people schizotypal personality disorder use DAR-0100A , drug show help cognitive deficit people Parkinson 's disease increase dopamine effect . Information collect experiment may lead good understand brain mechanism involve schizotypal personality disorder improve treatment psychological problem associate condition .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary Aims : 1 . To perform 5-year study three consecutive day DAR-0100A dose 15 mg placebo administer intravenously 30 minute 60 patient SPD ( 12/yr ) between-groups , randomize , double-blind design . Cognitive testing perform baseline ( Visit 1 ) third day drug/placebo administration ( Visit 4 ) . Subjects return minimum two week later Visit 5 receive drug ( randomize initially placebo ) placebo ( randomized drug ) double blind fashion identical protocol . This allow patient receive drug Secondary Aim 1 maintain blind . Baseline ( Visit 1 ) repeat cognitive testing ( Visit 4 ) also administer 60 healthy control per year ( 12/yr ) . The cognitive test work memory serve primary outcome measure include modify AX-CPT ( accuracy score AX , AY BX ANOVA ) , N-back ( delta difference 0-back-2-back ) , Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task ( PASAT ) ( % correct ANOVA ) . Other test include test work verbal memory , executive function , verbal learning secondary outcome measure well comparison test hypothesize change drug . 2 . To compare change primary outcome measure baseline Visit 4 test drug placebo administration SPD subject . 3 . To compare primary outcome variable baseline Visit 4 patient group healthy control . 4 . To obtain plasma DAR-0100A concentration Visit 4 evaluate plasma concentration relation cognitive change potential covariate . Secondary Aims : 1 . To evaluate change baseline Visit 4 cognitive test SPD patient receive drug first second phase . 2 . To evaluate secondary outcome comparison variable SPD patient placebo drug . Primary Hypotheses : 1 . Baseline primary outcome measure impair SPD subject compare control . 2 . SPD subject DAR-0100A show improvement primary measure great healthy control SPD patient randomize placebo baseline Visit 4 . 3 . SPD patient show significant improvement primary outcome variable drug compare placebo comparis-on perceptual ( JLOT ) process speed/attentional task ( Trails A ) .</detailed_description>
