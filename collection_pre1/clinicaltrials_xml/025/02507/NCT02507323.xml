	<brief_summary>This study design randomize , double-blind trial provide definitive evidence effect ticagrelor prasugrel myocardial salvage patient anterior ST Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction ( STEMI ) undergo primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention ( PCI ) . This study also measure effect ticagrelor vs. prasugrel secondary endpoint list . This study design aim test hypothesis ticagrelor reduce myocardial infarct size proportion ischemic area risk compare prasugrel .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ticagrelor vs. Prasugrel Effects Infarct Size</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects research staff ( include Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) reader interventional cardiologist ) know active treatment study drug subject receive . Study Arm 1 : Ticagrelor ( 180 mg load dose , follow 90 mg twice day ) PO plus match placebo Study Arm 2 : Prasugrel ( 60 mg load dose follow 5 10 mg per day base weight ) PO plus match placebo Additional study drug : Aspirin ( 81mg per day ) Participation study 90 day include 4 study visit ( hospital stay ) 3 telephone call . ENROLLMENT PROCEDURES : The following procedure complete informed consent obtain : - Informed Consent Form sign - Medical history - Vital sign ( eg , blood pressure , heart rate , respiration rate , temperature ) - Review Adverse Events ( AEs ) Serious Adverse Events ( SAEs ) ( AEs possibly relate study procedure SAEs collect ) - Documentation concomitant medication - Physical exam - Body height - Body weight - 12-lead Electrocardiogram ( ECG ) - Angiographic Percutaneous Coronary Intervention ( PCI ) data - Randomization treatment assignment - Investigational product dispensing ( Day 0 hospital stay ) - Loading dose Day 0 - 3 day investigational product dose hospital - 30 day supply dispense investigational product Day 3 subject take home - Local laboratory Assessments : - Blood draw Creatine Kinase-MB ( CK-MB ) troponin I - Blood pregnancy ( female childbearing potential ) FOLLOW UP PROCEDURES : Day 5 - Vital sign ( e.g. , blood pressure , heart rate , respiration rate , temperature ) - Review Adverse Events Serious Adverse Events ( AEs possibly relate study procedure SAEs collect ) - Cardiac MRI - Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction ( LVEF ) , Left Ventricular End-Diastolic Volume ( LVEDV ) , Left Ventricular End-Systolic Volume ( LVESV ) calculation - Serum creatinine , Complete Blood Count ( CBC ) - Documentation concomitant medication investigational product compliance Day 30 ( +/- 1 day ) , Day 60 ( +/- 2 day ) - Vital sign ( e.g. , blood pressure , heart rate , respiration rate , temperature ) - Review Adverse Events Serious Adverse Events ( AEs possibly relate study procedure SAEs collect ) - LVEF , LVEDV , LVESV calculation - Serum creatinine , CBC - Documentation concomitant medication investigational product compliance - Investigational Product Dispensing Day 14 , Day 44 , Day 74 ( +/- 2 day ) : Phone call performed ensure drug compliance , review concomitant medication review event . On Day 74 , study staff confirm whether subject see regular cardiologist . Subject instruct bring information Day 90 visit cardiologist tell arm participate continuation care medication therapy . Day 90 Termination/End Study ( +/- 2 day ) : - Vital sign ( eg , sit blood pressure , heart rate , respiration rate , temperature ) - Review Adverse Events Serious Adverse Events ( AEs possibly relate study procedure SAEs collect ) - Cardiac MRI - LVEF , LVEDV , LVESV calculation - Serum creatinine , CBC - Documentation concomitant medication investigational product compliance - If available subject consent , subject 's cardiologist inform arm study participate continuation care medication therapy .</detailed_description>
