	<brief_summary>Based preliminary data previous study , hypothesize ambient temperature experience individual influence food intake . Specifically , exposure temperature thermoneutral zone ( TNZ ) decrease consumption young adult sedentary situation . Researchers execute crossover randomize control trial specifically test thermal exposure effect individual female 's food consumption .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Influence Ambient Temperature Office Behaviors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants receive wear t-shirt . They thermal image take inner canthus eye middle finger nail bed , represent baseline core peripheral temperature , respectively . They also metabolic rate measure via canopy hood method . At initial visit , randomize either colder environment ( 66-68°F ) warmer environment ( 77-79°F ) artifice monitor routine office work abnormal temperature condition . Their knowledge experiment limited end . They experience temperature filling paperwork perform basic office task 7 hour work day . At begin end day fill questionnaire appetite thermal comfort . After first 3.5 hour , another thermal image take participant present lasagna water direct eat leisure subsequently finish office task next 3.5 hour . A thermal image take metabolic rate assessed end day . Snacks available throughout day . The participant return approximately 1 week later experience thermal environment follow protocol . The participant debrief parameter experiment body measurement take end prevent bias subject limit food intake . We quantify energy intake weigh remain food compare know caloric content weight bomb calorimetry test . The infrared thermal image determine whether temperature experienced extreme enough initiate change thermoregulation .</detailed_description>
