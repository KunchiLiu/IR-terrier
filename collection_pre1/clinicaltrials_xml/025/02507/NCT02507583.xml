	<brief_summary>This human Phase 1 trial continuation Phase 1 trial enrol patient recurrent glioma ( # TJU-14379-101 ) design previously conduct Phase 1 human trial institution . With certain modification , intend reproduce safety result recurrent glioma previous trial well explore objective clinical response newly diagnose patient . Protocol 14379-101 close accrual Abbreviated Clinical Report prepare FDA submission . The safety profile protocol quite favorable . This treatment involve take patient 's tumor cell surgery , treat investigational new drug ( antisense molecule ) design shut target surface receptor protein , re-implanting cell , encapsulate small diffusion chamber size nickel patient 's abdomen within 24 hour surgery . Loss surface receptor cause tumor cell die process call apoptosis . As tumor cell die , release small particle call exosomes , full tumor antigen . The investigator believe exosomes well presence antisense molecule work together activate immune system tumor slowly diffuse chamber . Immune cell immediately available activation outside chamber wound create implant tumor cell foreign body ( chamber ) present wound . In trial , dose escalation therapeutic agent involve increase biodiffusion chamber number well time biodiffusion chamber remain implanted . The wound chamber fortify initial immune response eventually lead activation immune system T cell attack eliminate tumor . By train immune system recognize tumor , patient also protect immune surveillance later tumor growth tumor recur . Compared treatment alternative tumor recurrence , include boost radiation chemotherapy , treatment represent potentially great benefit few risk .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This trial adaptation Protocol 101 recently close rapid complete accrual , escalation induction vaccination four cohort . For practical purpose , standard dose-escalation study possible current paradigm . Although investigator may identify distinct bioactive byproduct Insulin-like growth factor receptor-1 Antisense Oligodeoxynucleotide ( IGF-1R/AS ODN ) -induced tumor cell apoptosis ( exosomes ) , difficult perform dose escalation typical fashion . Also , antigen concentration affect immune response biphasic manner : little much dampen immune response , even antigen antigen know , typical pharmacologic dose escalation would follow typical pharmacokinetics . For reason , Protocol 102 , 32 patient therapy initial surgery 4 randomize cohort 8 patient . Chamber number implantation duration vary four cohort Protocol 102 . There documented increase tumor infiltrate lymphocyte treatment original trial , observation provide preliminary support evidence therapeutic vaccine elicit adaptive immune response . Protocol 102 design elucidate immune response quantitative assessment tumor specific T cell well circulate M2 macrophage treatment . The design Phase 1 trial allow statistical analysis antigen dose ( number chamber ) time exposure ( chamber dwell time ) either variable may relate toxicity treatment response . A summary treatment paradigm include : Pre-operative plasma leukopheresis , surgery tissue harvest implantation 10 20 diffusion chamber rectus sheath IGF-1R/AS ODN previously report within 24 hour craniotomy , implant either 24 48 hour . All patient meet eligibility criterion agree participate study potential candidate therapy .</detailed_description>
