	<brief_summary>Parabolic flight ground-based condition free-fall ( 0G ) create long enough safely test change human perception behavior . In addition 0G period , parabolic flight generates equal duration period 1.8G , present another unique opportunity test responses hypergravity back 1G . It well know performance decrement occur astronaut gravity level transition . Illusions commonly felt orbit well disorientation perceptual limitation , mainly due psycho-physiological change adaptation lack familiar point reference space environment . Studies perform previous space mission show several change occur different gravity condition , point , example , color shadow misleading , depth distance perception weaken , linear perspective lose . Visual perception primary importance spatial orientation object recognition static vestibular ( otolithic ) proprioceptive signal absent free-floating . Consequently , astronauts become increasingly dependent vision perceive motion orientation . All factor play important role adaptation human spaceflight need analyzed understand underlie mechanism regulate human psycho-physiological adaptive process change gravity . Human psycho-physiological health safeguard possibly improve long-term human space mission program near future . The primary objective experiment investigate SWI illusion present alter gravity environment . Since weight estimate 0G , investigator develop procedure subject ask estimate object ' mass shake rather lift . Our result 1G indicate size-mass illusion ( SMI ) also present 1G . Our hypothesis previously observe alteration 3D visual perception 0G , particularly height 3D object , well change proprioceptive input , responsible change SMI 0G 1.8G compare 1G . In separate proposal , investigator also propose perform experiment use ESA short-arm human centrifuge ( SAHC ) , subject expose various centrifugal force level , investigate role proprioceptive cue size-mass illusion .</brief_summary>
