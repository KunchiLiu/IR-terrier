	<detailed_description>Introduction Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) third leading cause cancer death worldwide . Despite improvement HCC therapy , prognosis HCC patient remain poor due high incidence recurrence . An improved understanding pathogenesis HCC development would facilitate development effective outcome diagnosis treatment HCC early stage . Currently , molecular alteration tumor scrutinize genome-wide scale , cover different dimension , gene expression , epigenetic change , chromosomal aberration , recently , next generation sequence . A large number molecular marker associate development HCC . could useful clinic ; however , racial difference report , need examine thoroughly . It estimate 51.5 % HCC case attribute HCV infection . Among , mention polymorphism IL28B gene , e.g . rs12979860 C/T rs4803217 . The IL-28B gene encode interferon-lamda 3 ( IFN-λ3 ) , belong type III IFN family include IFN-λ1 , IFN-λ2 , IFN-λ3 . IFN-λ interact trans membrane receptor induces potent antiviral response mediate activation JAK-STAT MAPK pathway . IL-28B polymorphism link efficiency inflammatory process HCV infection mechanism HCV adopts escape innate adap¬tive immunity . Interestingly , since type III IFN find inhibit HBV HCV replication experimental model , During last year , number study assess association IL-28B polymorphism risk HCC liver cirrhosis ( LC ) development different population ; however , result inconsistent inconclusive . For reason , deep comprehension impact IL28B polymorphisms HCC occurrence mandatory . Interestingly , polymorphisms locate 3 ' untranslated region ( UTR ) IL28B , e.g . rs 4803217 , seem interfere bind miRNA , date recognize important post-transcriptional regulator . miRNA , fact , small , interfering , non-coding RNA 21-30 nucleotide length , promote modulation 200 mRNAs widely associate human cancer . In last year miRNA acquire grow relevance potential biomarkers several disease include cancer . In particular , discovery extracellular miRNA , stable circulation , drive lot researcher evaluation aim identification new useful less invasive diagnostic marker also HCC . Objectives The overall goal investigate Impact IL-28B rs12979860 rs4803217 gene polymorphism associate miRNAs deregulation HCV-related hepatocellular carcinoma Specific Objectives : 1 . To determine association IL 28B polymorphism ( ) risk HCC chronic hepatitis C patient . 2 . To screen wide panel miRNAs uncover deregulate one chronic hepatitis C progression toward HCC 3 . To identify association among IL 28B polymorphism ( ) major deregulate miRNAs predictor marker HCC chronic hepatitis C patient Research Approach Methodology Patients method : Patients : This study include 405 Subjects divide 3 group : Group 1 . This group include patient chronic hepatitis C ( . =135 ) Group2 . This group include patient chronic hepatitis C ( . =135 ) cirrhosis ( F4 ) . Group3 . This group include patient HCV related HCC ( . =135 ) This confirm presence focal lesion detect Imaging ( compute tomography ( CT ) ultrasound ) , elevate serum AFP . • The basis sample size calculation follow : - Alpha Feto Protein : ses 41-60 % , sp 80-94 % - Prevalence HCC among HCV infect patient : 5-10 % - Calculation base specificity alpha feto protein average 87 % A total 405 case average 135 case /group require , base confidence 90 margin error 5 % , prevalence HCC among HCV infect patient 7 % Methods : 1 . Serum α fetoprotein level routinely test patient decompensated cirrhosis . AFP level generally elevate case prove HCC , however , level range 15 650 ng/ml . The diagnosis HCC confirm 4 phase multidetector compute tomography ( CT ) scan dynamic contrast enhance magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . 2 . HCV RNA quantification . Plasma obtain HCV RNA determine RT-PCR plasma use Cobas AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan HCV Test ( Roche Diagnostics , Branchburg , ( NJ ) . 3 . IL28B Polymorphism : SNP rs12979860 4803217 determined whole blood allelic discrimination use specific probe real time PCR . 4. miRNA quantification RNAs extract serum use miRNeasy Mini Kit ( Quiagen ) accord manufacturer 's instruction . The RNA purity assess RNA concentration quantify NanoDrop ND-1000 ( Nanodrop , United States ) . cDNA obtain miScript II Reverse Transcription Kits ( Quiagen ) A Preamplification perform use miScript PreAMP PCR Kits ( Quiagen ) Real Time PCRarray do use miScript miRNA PCR Arrays , SYBR Green PCR Master Mix ( Quiagen ) . 5 . Statistical Analysis : Statistical analysis perform use SPSS Statistics software . P-values , 0.05 consider significant . IL28B SNPs comparison do stratify patient accord rs12979860CC rs12979860CT/TT genotype 4803217 Analysis miRNA PCR Array do specific Data Analysis Software specifically supply Quiagen .</detailed_description>
