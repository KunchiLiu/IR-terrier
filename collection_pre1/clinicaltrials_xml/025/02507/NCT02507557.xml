	<detailed_description>I . Background Excessive fluid loss often report gastrointestinal surgical patient due preoperative fasting bowel preparation . Many factor may exacerbate lack fluid volume , include intraoperative blood loss fluid loss , anesthetic drug-induced peripheral vasodilatation , well systemic inflammatory response syndrome , systemic capillary leak syndrome , endothelial barrier dysfunction transfer intravascular fluid third space cause surgical trauma . Insufficient fluid infusion may cause hypovolemia tissue hypoperfusion , may delay postoperative recovery even induce postoperative acute renal failure . On hand , fluid overload lead edema , increase oxygen diffusion distance lung mesenchyme cell , cause tissue ischemia , hypoxia , acidosis even affect recovery gastrointestinal function heal incision . It prove improper fluid therapy perioperative period associate poor outcome patient gastrointestinal surgery . Goal-directed fluid therapy ( GDFT ) regimen emphasize personalize fluid infusion optimize intraoperative hemodynamics tissue perfusion , include rise stroke volume , increase arterial oxygen saturation , may result improve postoperative outcome . Flo-Trac/Vigileo system develop Edwards Technology , monitor continuous cardiac output via peripheral artery . The monitoring approach system prove convenient , safe minimally invasive . As important indicator system , stroke volume variation ( SVV ) accurately reflect volume status patient . The principle SVV preload change , cause intrathoracic pressure change inspiratory expiratory phase , lead arterial pulse pressure fluctuation , thus affect stroke volume ( SV ) . SV may vary different volume load . Through measure analyze difference assess circulation status , SVV provide guidance fluid therapy . The continuous real-time SVV monitoring provide data patient ' circulation status , thereby optimize clinical fluid treatment option avoid excessive insufficient volume . For patient gastrointestinal surgery , SVV guidance surgery accurately regulate fluid infusion , contribute early postoperative recovery improve patient prognosis . In present study , SVV-directed fluid therapy perform patient gastrointestinal surgery compare conventional fluid treatment regimen mobility mortality postoperative complication , postoperative recovery , length hospital stay . The investigator aim provide clinical evidence reasonable intraoperative fluid management patient . II . Objectives The aim study compare effect GDFT strategy conventional fluid management morbidity mortality postoperative complication , length postoperative hospital stay , medical expense , provide clinical evidence optimize intraoperative fluid management patient undergone gastrointestinal surgery . III . Research Plan 1 . Design : quantitative observational comparative effectiveness research . 2 . Sample Volume : 200 case subject experimental group control group , respectively . 3 . Research phase The research divide three phase 1 . Retrospective analysis perioperative data patient undergone gastrointestinal surgery accord traditional practice January June 2015 . Data postoperative length hospital stay , morbidity mortality complication collect electronic database . The fluid administrate accord traditional method . Total intake volume = compensatory volume expansion ( CVE ) + physically require volume+ cumulative loss volume + continue loss volume + loss volume third space . Both physically require volume cumulative loss volume replace accord 4-2-1 rule . Crystalloid colloid give ratio 2/1 . According bleeding , RBC plasma give necessary . HR50 /min~100/min MAP60~100mmHg maintain surgery group . When SBP &lt; 90 mmHg MAP &lt; 60 mmHg , patient give vasoactive drug bitartrate noradrenaline . 2 . Training phase : GDFT protocol training implemented receive ethic approval estimate July September 2015 . A 3-month training period allow research staff become familiar protocol . 3 . Implementation phase : After 3 month training , estimate October 2015 till March 2016 , fluid management conduct patient gastrointestinal surgery basis GDFT protocol . Then perioperative data include patient phase collect retrospectively electronic database . 4 . GDFT protocol 1 . Anesthesia management The radial artery line place anesthesia . The invasively arterial blood pressure , ECG , HR SPO2 monitor . The Flo-Trac/Vigileo monitoring system connect radial artery line GDFT group , CO , SV , SVV hemodynamic parameter monitor . In addition , bispectral index ( BIS ) continuously monitor assess depth sedation . Induction : 0.01~0.03 mg/kg midazolam , 0.2~0.4μg/kg sufentanil , 1~2 mg/kg propofol 0.6~0.9 mg/kg rocuronium inject intravenously anesthesia induction . After completion endotracheal intubation , internal jugular puncture catheterization undergone right side monitor central vein pressure . Maintenance : After endotracheal intubation , mechanical ventilation initiate . The tidal volume set 6~8 mL/kg , respiratory rate 10 14 times/min inhalation exhalation ratio 1:2 . In surgery , partial pressure carbon dioxide end expiratory gas keep level 35 - 45 mmHg . And remifentanil ( target concentration effect compartment 4 - 8 ng / mL ) propofol ( target concentration plasma 3 - 5μg / mL ) intravenous target-controlled infusion give maintain anesthesia effect . BIS value maintain 40 - 50 . Besides , 0.1~0.3μg/kg sufentanil 0.1~0.2 mg/kg rocuronium inject intermittently . About 30 minute end surgery , bolus 0.1~0.3μg/kg sufentanil administer . Recovery : The depth anesthesia reduce gradually end surgery . In recovery period , atropine neostigmine give muscle relaxant antagonist . Extubation perform accord awareness , breathing , muscle strength reflex recovery patient . All patient deliver ICU surgery . 2 . Fluid Treatment Compensatory volume expansion ( CVE ) replace 5mL/kg Ringer 's lactate solution induction . The maintain dose infusion crystalloid surgery : 2~4 ml/kg/h open procedure ( maximum dose 400ml/h ) , 1~2 ml/kg/h laparoscopic procedure ( maximum dose 200ml/h ) respectively . Fluid replacement direct SV value . After incision ( pneumoperitoneum laparoscopic case ) give 200 mL Hydroxyethyl Starch 130/0.4 Sodium Chloride bolus &lt; 10 min . If SV increase &gt; 10 % , repeat bolus SV increase &lt; 10 % . Record peak value achieve . Give colloid bolus SV drop 10 % peak value repeat cycle . According bleeding , RBC plasma give necessary . SaO2≥95 % , Hb &gt; 70g/L , core body temperature &gt; 37 ℃ , HR50 /min~100/min MAP60~100mmHg maintain surgery group . When SBP &lt; 90 mmHg MAP &lt; 60 mmHg , two group give vasoactive drug bitartrate noradrenaline . 5 . Monitoring variable 1 . Intraoperative intake output volume : volume intraoperative crystalloid , volume colloid , blood transfusion volume , urine output , blood loss use vasoactive agent . 2 . Hemodynamic variable : MAP , HR , SaO2 , CVP , CO , CI , SV , SVV , stroke volume index ( SVI ) systemic vascular resistance ( SVR ) follow time point : baseline , immediately induction intubation , begin surgery every five minute follow , end surgery , etc .</detailed_description>
