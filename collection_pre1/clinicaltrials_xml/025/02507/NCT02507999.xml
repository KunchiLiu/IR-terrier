	<brief_summary>Goal direct therapy ( GDT ) technique , employ non-invasive cardiac output monitoring ( NICOM ) device guide management circulate blood volume blood pressure procedure . The purpose study determine whether use goal-directed therapy optimize blood volume cardiac output procedure improve outcome patient undergo endovascular treatment brain aneurysm .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Goal-directed Therapy Endovascular Coiling Cerebral Aneurysm Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subarachnoid hemorrhage ( SAH ) result rupture intracranial cerebral aneurysms life threaten condition ; estimate incidence 6-10 case per 100,000 person per year . Endovascular coil emobolization aneurysm perform isolate aneurysm reduce risk re-bleeding . Unfortunately , despite timely successful intervention approximate 25 % post-coiling patient suffer immediate and/or long-term injury include death result intracranial bleeding . This mainly consequence subarachnoid hemorrhage-related complication , especially cerebral vasospasm . Angiographic vasospasm symptomatic vasospasm occur 30-70 % 20-30 % SAH patient respectively . Goal-directed therapy ( GDT ) provide means assess manage circulating volume cardiac output . In study , investigator would investigate use GDT aneurysm coiling procedure improve clinical course patient . This blind , randomize pilot study compare clinical outcome endovascular coil patient allocate one two treatment : GDT non-GDT . Randomization consent patient randomized GDT non-GDT group 1:1 ratio . The attend anesthesiologist blind nature intervention . However , surgeon , patient , outcome assessor blind treatment intervention . In patient , arterial catheter ( routinely use patient ) insert connect Flotrac ( Edward Lifesciences ) . After transfer patient angiogram suite , routine monitoring pulse oximetry , electrocardiography , non-invasive blood pressure monitoring , end-tidal CO2 temperature probe attach patient . Anesthesia conduct standard fashion . Patients randomize two group 1:1 ratio : GDT non-GDT therapy . - GDT group : attend anesthesiologist use data obtain Flotrac manage fluid hemodynamics procedure follow prescribed treatment algorithm . The treatment intervention start induction anesthesia continue patient extubated transfer back intensive care unit mechanical ventilation . - Non-GDT group : Flotrac connect machine value blind anesthesiologist interventionist . The screen Flotrac cover opaque plastic bag alarm turn . The attend anesthesiologist make clinical decision regard management fluid hemodynamics base current individual routine practice .</detailed_description>
