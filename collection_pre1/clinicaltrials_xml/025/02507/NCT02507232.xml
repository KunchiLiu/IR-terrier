	<brief_summary>The purpose study test effectiveness safety NovoTTF-200A device patient low-grade glioma 's use use together temozolomide . Researchers would also like know whether use NovoTTF-200A , without temozolomide , associate few negative side effect mental function may see currently use treatment option .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II Study NovoTTF-200A Alone With Temozolomide Patients With Low-Grade Gliomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 2,000 3,000 low-grade glioma ( LGGs ) diagnose adults year United States . Based variety prognostic factor median overall survival range 3 9 year . NovoTTF-200A device produce alternate electrical field within human body disrupt cell division . These low intensity intermediate frequency electric field ( TTFields ) impair growth tumor cell arrest cell division induce apoptosis . Although FDA approve treatment recurrent progressive glioblastoma , investigation NovoTTF-200A warrant , set low-grade glioma potential stunt tumor growth without significant toxicity . NovoTTF-200A also show safe combine adjuvant 5-day temozolomide regimen newly diagnose glioblastoma ongoing clinical trial . Given low proliferative index low-grade glioma , combine NovoTTF-200A metronomic chemotherapy may effective . This phase II randomize , 2-arm , open label study NovoTTF-200A alone combine daily temozolomide treatment patient newly diagnose low-grade glioma . Patients randomize 1:1 one two arm total 42 patient ( 21 per arm ) . Arm A receive NovoTTF-200A Arm B receive NovoTTF-200A low-dose ( 50 mg/m2 ) daily temozolomide regimen . All patient provide informed consent screen eligibility . Baseline assessment include vital sign , physical exam , blood hematology chemistry , Karnofsky Performance Status ( KPS ) evaluation , Quality Life ( QOL ) assessment use Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy-Brain ( FACT-Br ) , neurological exam neuro-imaging ( MRI ) brain . An extra blood sample collect biomarker study . Clinical evaluation include physical exam , vitals , KPS , neurological exam blood hematology chemistry ( obtain every month throughout treatment ) . Neuro-imaging assessment response perform approximately every 3 month . QOL assess KPS rating scale FACT-Br questionnaire screening every six month treatment . Blood collect correlative study Day 1 every even cycle . Any molecular information derive correlative study clinical care associate patient 's response . Patients continue monthly cycle treatment 12 cycle disease progression unacceptable toxicity ( whichever occurs first ) . For Arm B , patient may continue NovoTTF-200A treatment temozolomide discontinue early toxicity . An end treatment visit clinical evaluation safety assessment perform approximately four six week withdraw study treatment . Patients discontinue study treatment follow month 18 24 tumor assessment discontinue study treatment without disease progression survival .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically confirm lowgrade glioma include astrocytoma grade 2 , oligodendroglioma grade 2 , oligoastrocytoma grade 2 . Tumor supratentorially locate measureable . Disease receive prior radiation , radiosurgery , chemotherapy , investigational treatment direct brain tumor time . Previous surgical procedure allow . Age ≥ 18 year . Life expectancy &gt; 12 week . Either receive steroid disease symptom stable dose steroid least 5 day . Karnofsky Performance Status ( KPS ) ≥ 60 % Adequate hematologic function evidence : Absolute Neutrophil Count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.5 x 109/L Platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/L Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL Adequate renal function evidence : AST/SGOT ALT/SPGT ≤ 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x institution 's ULN Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x institution 's ULN Pilocytic astrocytoma , ganglioglioma , pleomorphic xanthastrocytoma , dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor eligible . Current anticipated use investigational agent . Implanted electronic medical device brain ( e.g. , deep brain stimulator , vagus nerve stimulator , programmable shunt ) . Patients less 4 week surgery insufficient recovery surgicalrelated trauma wound healing . Severe uncontrolled medical disorder would , investigator 's opinion , impair ability receive study treatment ( i.e. , uncontrolled diabetes , chronic renal disease , chronic pulmonary disease active , uncontrolled infection , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement ) . Severe cardiac insufficiency ( NYHA III IV ) , uncontrolled and/or unstable cardiac coronary artery disease . Pregnant nursing .</criteria>
