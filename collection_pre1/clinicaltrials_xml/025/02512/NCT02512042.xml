	<brief_title>Bioequivalence Study With Clinical Endpoint Comparing Brinzolamide 1 % Ophthalmic Suspension Azopt® 1 % Ophthalmic Suspension In Treatment Chronic Open Angle Glaucoma Ocular Hypertension Both Eyes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study conduct adult subject , 18 year inclusive , male non pregnant female , diagnose chronic open angle glaucoma ocular hypertension eye . Qualifying Intra Ocular Pressure ( IOPs ) follow wash-out , baseline ( Day 0/hour 0 i.e. , 8:00 ) ≥ 22 milli meter mercury ( mm Hg ) ≤ 34 mm Hg eye asymmetry IOP eye great 5 mm Hg . Each study subject use one drop test reference Ophthalmic Suspension eye three time daily approximately 8:00am , 04:00 pm 10:00 pm 42 day ( 6 week ) . The dose mode treatment choose study dosage approve United States Food Drug administration ( US FDA ) use treatment patient Chronic Open Angle Glaucoma . The study subject undergo clinical evaluation throughout study order ass efficacy safety . Study subject primary endpoint evaluation assess 2 week ( 14 day ) 6 week ( 42 day ) treatment study subject deem eligible evaluation , ( i.e. , Visit III - Day 14 ± 2 day Visit IV - Day 42 ± 3 day ) . The primary bioequivalence comparison test reference product mean difference intraocular pressure ( IOP ) eye four time point , i.e. , approximately 8:00 10:00 Day 14 ( ± 2 day ) Day 42 ( ± 3 day ) visit .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Male nonpregnant female age 18 year Body Mass Index ( BMI ) 18.5 35 Kg/m2 , chronic open angle glaucoma ocular hypertension eye stable ocular hypotensive treatment regimen . 2 . Subjects require treatment eye able discontinue use ocular hypotensive medication ( ) switch ocular hypotensive medication undergo appropriate washout period . 3 . Adequate washout period prior baseline ocular hypotensive medication . In order minimize potential risk subject due IOP elevation washout period , investigator may choose substitute parasympathomimetic carbonic anhydrase inhibitor place sympathomimetic , alphaagonist , betaadrenergic block agent , prostaglandin . However , subject must discontinue ocular hypotensive medication minimum washout period . 4 . Baseline ( Day 0/hour 0 ) IOP ≥ 22 mm Hg ≤ 34 mm Hg eye asymmetry IOP eye great 5 mm Hg . 5 . Baseline best correct visual acuity equivalent 20/200 good eye . 6 . Study subject must provide IRB approve write informed consent use late version IRB inform consent form . In addition , study subject must sign Health Insurance Portability Accountability Act ( HIPAA ) authorization , applicable . 7 . Study subject literate willing complete subject diary regularly direct . 8 . Study subject must good health free clinically significant disease apart indication study . 9 . Females child bear potential ( WOCBP* ) must pregnant lactate baseline visit ( documented negative serum pregnancy test minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L equivalent unit betahuman chorionic gonadotropin ( BetaHCG ) screen urine pregnancy baseline . *All female subject consider childbearing potential unless postmenopausal . Female subject childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) define sexually mature woman without prior hysterectomy , evidence menses past 12 month . However , woman amenorrheic past 12 month still consider childbearing potential , amenorrhea possibly due cause , include prior chemotherapy , antiestrogens , ovarian suppression . Postmenopausal woman ( defined woman amenorrheic least 12 consecutive month , appropriate age group , without know suspected primary cause ) woman sterilize surgically otherwise prove sterile ( i.e. , total hysterectomy , bilateral oophorectomy surgery least 4 week prior randomization ) consider WOCBP . Subjects undergone tubal ligation NOT consider surgically sterile . 10 . Female subject childbearing potential must willing use acceptable form birth control day first dose administration 30 day last administration IP . For purpose study follow consider acceptable method birth control : oral injectable contraceptive , contraceptive patch , DepoProvera® ( Medroxyprogesterone acetate stabilize least 3 month ) ; vaginal contraceptive ; contraceptive implant ; double barrier method ( e.g . condom spermicide ) ; Nuvaring vaginal hormonal birth control , IUD , abstinence second method birth control subject become sexually active . A sterile sexual partner NOT consider adequate form birth control . 11 . All male subject must agree use accept method birth control partner , day first dose administration ( 30 day last administration study drug ) . Please see acceptable form `` Female '' birth control . Abstinence acceptable method birth control male . 12 . Study subject must willing able understand comply requirement protocol , include attendance require schedule study visit . 13 . Study subject must willing refrain use treatment Chronic Open Angle Glaucoma ( COAG ) , investigational product . 1 . Females pregnant , breast feeding , plan pregnancy course study 30 day last study dose . 2 . Females childbearing potential agree utilize adequate form contraception . 3 . Current past history severe hepatic renal impairment . 4 . Current history within two month prior baseline significant ocular disease , e.g. , corneal edema , uveitis , ocular infection , ocular trauma either eye . 5 . Current corneal abnormality would prevent accurate IOP reading Goldmann applanation tonometer e.g . corneal dystrophy , corneal abrasion , corneal ulcer , keratitis , keratoconus keratoglobus . 6 .
