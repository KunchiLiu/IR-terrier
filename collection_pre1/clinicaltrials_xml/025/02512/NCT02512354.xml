	<brief_summary>This research concern contribution new examination , high-throughput exome sequencing , diagnosis cause polymalformative fetal syndrome . With currently available examination , cause polyformative syndrome , correspond association several congenital malformation vary degree severity different organ , remain unknown large number case . High-throughput exome sequencing ( HTES ) diagnostic tool allow simultaneous analysis coding part DNA . This examination already show superior diagnostic capability every post-natal diagnostic context , particulier infant malformation associate intellectual deficiency . Its contribution yet study large number fetus polymalformations . To investigate usefulness HTES , propose carry examination 100 fetus polymalformations , well usual examination include chromosomal microarray analysis possibly study specific gene may explain malformation . A blood sample take parent allow interpretation result .</brief_summary>
