	<brief_title>A Trial On 4 Cycles Of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Plus Concurrent Chemoradiation In N2-3 Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The standard treatment strategy locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ) nowadays concurrent chemoradiation ( CRT ) , base intensity-modulated radiation therapy ( IMRT ) achieve satisfactory local-regional control 5-year overall survival ( OS ) 83.0 % . However , distant metastasis remain major cause treatment failure , especially patient T1-4N2-3M0 disease ( N2-3 NPC ) . The distant metastasis reach 35-48 % CRT alone . To decrease distant metastasis locally advance NPC improve survival , approach modify time chemotherapy make mainly 2 type : one CRT plus adjuvant chemotherapy ( ACT ) , neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( NACT ) plus CRT . It prove CRT plus ACT could improve survival locally advance NPC . Some clinical trial indicate locally advanced NPC patient 2-3 cycle NACT plus CRT good survival CRT alone though role NACT remain controversial . It known N stage far significant predict factor metastasis risk NPC . N2-3 NPC also prove quite great risk distant failure . 51.4 % distant metastasis happen within 1 year CRT . The investigator infer subclinical micrometastases already present treatment start . Hence , appropriate consider N2-3 NPC systemic disease instead local disease . NACT sufficient intensity 4 cycle might effective enough control pre-existing micrometastases . Therefore , phase 3 multicenter randomize control trial conduct enroll 144 patient N2-3 NPC . After stratification N stage , patient allocate 2 treatment group randomly ratio 1:1 applied different treatment strategy make comparison NACT 4 cycle plus CRT base IMRT CRT alone N2-3 NPC distant metastasis , survival adverse reaction .</detailed_description>
