	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine dry fruit vegetable supplement ( Juice Plus+ ) alter gut microbiome improve gut permeability inflammatory level obese , stressed population . The microbiome component gene long know critical determinant nutritional value food eat . Recently , become clear composition microbiome metabolite influence host immune system , thereby alter host physiology . Both obesity chronic stress show altered gut microbiome ; condition also lead increased systemic inflammatory molecule lead increase risk type 2 diabetes disease cause chronic inflammation . Juice Plus+ consume overweight population combine eight week exercise regime show decreased marker protein/lipid oxidation ( ox-LDL ) , total lipid oxidation ( TOS ) lower systemic concentration inflammatory cytokine , TNF-α . As systemic cytokine alter composition gut microbiome , study proposes determine decrease inflammation Juice Plus+ due change specie composition metabolism microbiome . This question particularly relevant population high inflammatory load result excess weight addition increase psychological stress . The investigator propose determine 1 ) Juice Plus+ consumption alters microbiome specie composition metabolism , 2 ) alteration intestinal permeability consumption Juice Plus+ 3 ) alteration coincide low systemic marker inflammation oxidative stress among individual psychologically stress overweight . The investigator use randomize , placebo-controlled design cohort overweight , female , critical care health care professional . Subjects receive supplement placebo sixteen week . At end 16 week , cohort receive supplement randomize also receive meal replacement component follow normal diet additional 4 week . Stool fast blood sample collect begin study ( baseline ) 8 , 16 20 week later . At time point , subject also consume cocktail glucose , mannitol lactulose second blood draw perform look absorption molecule .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact JuicePlus+ Health Status Overweight Stressed Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An anticipated eighty critical care , female health care professional recruit . This population show high occupational stress load increase risk post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) . The subject premenopausal , overweight/obese ( Body Mass Index -BMI : 25 - 40 kg/m2 ) age 25-50 year . Exclusion criterion include smoke sort , smokeless tobacco use , chronic excessive alcohol consumption ( &gt; 1 drink per day ) , pregnancy lactation , recent surgery illness , diabetes , heart disease , use antibiotic medication ( medication deem impact outcome measure protocol—medication use review case case basis principal investigator ) . Health history , medication dietary supplement questionnaire complete subject determine eligibility . A health perceive stress questionnaire also complete sampling period . Characteristics stool also record three day prior sample use Bristol criterion . All food drink intake record 7-day period prior provide first sample ( baseline ) . Subjects repeat procedure sample period . During initial record period , subject ask consume food represent usual diet , combine 4 fruit vegetable serving day , instruct attempt mimic diet 7 day period sample period . Diet record analyze use nutrition software data use analysis purpose need . Subjects encourage consume usual diet throughout study period . Subjects weigh total body composition determine use Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) baseline subject characterization . Prior DXA scan pregnancy test perform confirm subject pregnant . Subjects randomly assign supplement placebo capsule . The intervention start day 1 5 menstrual cycle avoid confound factor due menstrual cycle hormone variation . The capsule take meal morning even 3 capsule time , total 6 capsules/day 20 week period . At begin 17th week , subject consume supplement randomized one group add `` Complete '' meal replacement component replace first meal day second group follow normal diet . Initial Laboratory Visit : screening visit During initial visit laboratory , subject complete informed consent form , health history , medication dietary supplement usage perceive stress questionnaire . Subjects ' heart rate blood pressure , height , weight , waist , hip circumference measure . A pregnancy test perform confirm subject pregnant . Body composition determine via DXA determine body composition , increase visceral fat causative obesity-induced inflammation . Upon completion screen visit , subject schedule initial test visit . Test Visit Procedures For condition ( supplement placebo ) , subject report lab total three time . Subjects continue `` Complete '' meal-replacement phase study report lab one additional time . Subjects collect stool 24 hour prior report lab test occasion ( close possible time point ) . Subjects report lab 10 hour fast state , without perform strenuous activity within prior 48 hour . Subjects instruct obtain least 7 hour sleep night prior test . No supplement placebo take prior blood collection , describe . Stool Collection Stool sample collect subject 24 hour immediately report lab test occasion ( close possible time point ) . Subjects instructed line pail biohazard bag , complete bowel movement bag , seal bag zip tie , place bag insulate cooler bag two freezer pack . The pail , biohazard bag , zip tie , insulate cooler freezer pack provide investigator . Verbal write instruction collection , storage , delivery stool sample available participant . Upon receipt investigator , sample store -70 degree Celsius processing . All sample handle occur fume hood universal precaution observe minimize risk infection . Following publication study result , remain stool sample dispose properly biohazard waste . Blood Collection Blood sample ( approximately 20 ml ; 4 teaspoon ) take subject via venipuncture ( someone skilled collect blood ) . After first blood draw , subject consume cocktail glucose , lactulose mannitol . Another blood sample ( 3 ml ) collect 90 minute ingestion cocktail . The purpose consume cocktail collect second blood sample determine impact treatment glucose tolerance also effect intestinal permeability . The collected blood sample process stored multiple aliquot -70 degree Celsius analyze . Following publication study result , remain blood sample dispose properly biohazard waste . Universal precaution observe minimize risk infection injury either subject phlebotomist . Potential risk procedure include soreness around sample site , bruising , infection . White Blood Cell Harvest White blood cell harvest collected whole blood use density gradient ( Ficoll ) store multiple aliquot -70 degree Celsius analyze . Following publication study result , remain cell sample dispose properly biohazard waste . Universal precaution observe minimize risk infection contamination . Dietary Intake Records All subject ask consume usual diet throughout study period instruct attempt mimic diet 7 day prior sample . Subjects record food drink consume 7 day prior sample day .</detailed_description>
