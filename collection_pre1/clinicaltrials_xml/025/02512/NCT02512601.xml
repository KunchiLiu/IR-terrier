	<brief_title>Prospective Evaluation QoL Patients With PTS Who Receive Compression Therapy Sulodexide</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic venous insufficiency , chronic venous disease ( CVD ) , prior deep-vein thrombosis ( DVT ) , diagnose post-thrombotic syndrome ( PTS ) . It calculate PTS occur 20 % 50 % patient episode DVT , even receive optimal anticoagulant treatment , disorder usually consolidate first 2 year acute thrombotic episode . The presentation PTS vary mild symptom clinical sign severe presentation approximately 10 % case , include chronic pain limbs limit activity ability work , untreatable oedema ulcer legs . The cornerstone treatment consolidated PTS compression treatment , especially form elastic compression stocking , frequent elevation leg , despite low level evidence , measure require strict possible therapeutic compliance part patient . There still little evidence `` venoactive '' agent effective PTS symptom ; nevertheless , use medication PTS widespread . In study González- Fajardo et al. , use compression stocking describe 75 % patient , study Lozano -Sánchez et al. , use describe 62 % patient . In latter study , venoactive drug use approximately 90 % patient . The diagnosis , stag , prognosis evolution severity various entity group together head CVD , include PTS , base mainly scale score system . Objective evaluation CVD severity tend base `` clinical , etiologic , anatomic pathophysiologic '' ( CEAP ) clinical classification , Venous Clinical Severity Score ( VCSS ) Villalta score . Nevertheless , present time recognise assessment severity necessarily coincide perception patient quality life , estimate generic questionnaire ( abbreviate 36-item Short-Form Health Survey questionnaire Short Form ( SF-36 ) disease-specific questionnaire ( Venous Insufficiency Epidemiological Economic Study questionnaire ( VEINES-QOL ) . Various study use scale , usually one . All study agree patient PTS low QoL without PTS , show generic specific instrument . Nonetheless , population examine study extremely heterogeneous respect use compression treatment , use drug duration observation . The problem remain solve whether therapeutic measure apply lead change QoL measure generic disease-specific instrument relatively long treatment period . Achieving favourable change patient ' perception quality life remain fundamental therapeutic compliance suitable physician-patient relationship treatment chronic disease , therefore PTS . This matter properly examine , first , cohort patient standardise possible respect stage seriousness disease use compression treatment pharmacological treatment . The standardisation stage seriousness disease , well mean standardise compression treatment , achieve appropriate inclusion exclusion criterion . As pharmacological treatment generally administer , sulodexide chosen purpose standardisation . This venoactive treatment antithrombotic , profibrinolytic endothelium-protective activity , already use PTS patient favourable result . The guideline Society Vascular Surgery , American Venous Forum American College Chest Physicians ( ACCP ) include among recommended pharmacological treatment , along compression , patient manifest chronic venous disease . Standardisation determination QoL envisage use generic questionnaire SF-36 disease-specific questionnaire VEINES-QOL . In way , study aim evaluate whether , standardise cohort patient mild moderate PTS , monitor sufficiently long follow-up period , quality life measure generic instrument disease-specific instrument evolve favourably patient profile . If case , different approach treatment disease necessary .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients ≥ 18 year , ≤ 75 year , gender ethnic group . Prior DVT document duplex colour Doppler ultrasound low limb ( value D dimer Doppler ultrasound available , keep clinical documentation note CRF ) .The previous medical report document prior DVT must store medical record . Postthrombotic syndrome ( PTS ) confirm duplex colour Doppler ultrasound low limbs.2 Villalta score ≥ 5 . To confirm presence PTS V1 , patient must Villalta score ≥ 5 positive duplex colour Doppler ultrasound scan low limb . Patients use compression therapy accordance study requirement . If patient use compression therapy , must prescribe screen visit ( V1 ) continue throughout patient 's participation study . During study , compression therapy must follow , compliance record investigator . All patient must degree compression : With orthosis : Compression 2229 mmHg , length 20 cm DVT area . With bandage : 710 long 10 cm wide . Both strategy ( orthosis v bandage ) equally applicable . Patients CEAP class : C0s C5 . DVT occur least 6 month ago 5 year ago . VEINESQOL score ≤ 45 enrolment visit ( V2 ) . For definitive enrolment study enrolment visit ( V2 ) , patient must total score VEINESQOL questionnaire : Score ≤ 60 add together response question : 1.11.9 ; 4a4d ; 5a5d ; 8a8e time Score≥9 add together response : 3 ; 6 ; 7 , standardisation questionnaire response , must add total VEINESQOL score ≤ 45 . Patients BMI ≤ 40 . Ability complete qualityoflife ( QoL ) questionnaire . Patients able use study drug properly . Ability grant inform consent . Women childbearing age must show negative result urine pregnancy test use suitable contraceptive method ( include hormonal contraceptive ) throughout entire period study . Any possible concomitant treatment haemorheological , phlebostatic venoactive medication must suspend screen visit . Patients &lt; 18 year &gt; 75 year . BMI &gt; 40 . Ankle brachial index ( ABI ) &lt; 0.75 . Primary chronic venous insufficiency . Patients know diagnosis thrombophilia . Unavailability medical report document prior DVT . Postthrombotic syndrome confirm duplex colour Doppler ultrasound low limb . Solid malignant neoplasm malignant blood disease active state require chemotherapy/radiotherapy . Inability grant consent refusal . Participation another clinical study 4 month prior screen study . Patients comply compression therapy require protocol 3 ( Detailed note inclusion criterion ) . Patients history hypersensitivity sulodexide excipients investigational product . Diagnosis inflammatory joint disease advance collagen disease . Pregnancy , breastfeed desire become pregnant study . Concomitant treatment anticoagulant , corticosteroid immunosuppressant .</criteria>
