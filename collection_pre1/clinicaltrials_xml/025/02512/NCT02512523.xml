	<brief_title>Exploratory Study Compare Effects Tenelia® Januvia® Glucose Variability add-on Metformin ( CGMS Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study enroll patient adequately control type 2 diabetes mellitus metformin ( 1,000 mg ) 8 week least longer randomly add teneliglipin ( 20 mg/day ) sitagliptin ( 100 mg/day ) 4 week . Continuous glucose monitoring check 4-week administration teneliglipin sitagliptin together mixed meal tolerance test ( MMTT ) . Other efficacy safety parameter also assess .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patient male female age ( equal ) 19 year old screening , inclusive . 2 . Patient diagnose type 2 diabetes mellitus least 3 month prior screen accord diagnostic criterion KDA screen 3 . Patient FPG ≤ 270 mg/dl ( 15.0 mmol/L ) screen 4 . Patient treat Metformin ( ≥1000 mg/day ) least 8 week prior screen 5 . Patient HbA1c ( 6.5 % ≤HbA1c≤9.0 % ) screen 6 . Patient adequate renal hepatic function screen define follow clinical chemistry result : ( male ) Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 × upper limit normal ( ULN ) , ( female ) Serum creatinine &lt; 1.4 × upper limit normal ( ULN ) , Serum alanine aminotransferase &lt; 2.5 × ULN Serum aspartate aminotransferase &lt; 2.5 × ULN 7 . Both male female patient partner childbearing potential must agree use 2 medically accept method contraception ( eg , barrier contraceptive [ male condom , female condom , diaphragm spermicidal gel ] , hormonal contraceptive [ implant , injectables , combination oral contraceptive , transdermal patch , contraceptive ring ] , intrauterine device ) course study ( exclude woman childbearing potential men sterilize ) . 8 . Male female patient partner surgically sterilize less 6 month prior study entry must agree use 2 medically accept method contraception per inclusion criterion 7 . 9 . Menopausal females must experience last period 12 month prior study entry classify childbearing potential . 10 . Patient ( legal guardian , applicable ) inform full nature purpose study , include possible risk side effect , understand information , voluntarily sign date write informed consent compliance protocol inclusion study 1 . Patients hypersensitivity/allergies main ingredient sitagliptin/teneligliptin excipients Investigational product ( eg . Mannitol ) . 2 . Patient severe ketosis , diabetic coma pre coma , Type 1 DM 3 . Patient suffer disease , include Type 2 diabetes complication , opinion Investigator , sufficiently severe render subject unfit , affect subject 's ability , participate study , example : Macroangiopathy symptom coronary heart disease peripheral arterial obstructive disease . Microangiopathy symptom ( autonomous ) neuropathy one following : gastroparesis Symptoms poor blood glucose control ( polyuria , polydipsia weight loss ) Severe infection , pre postoperative , severe trauma 4 . Patient medical history unstable angina , heart failure ( New York Heart Association class ⅢIV ) clinically significant ECG abnormality ventricular tachycardia 5 . The subject diastolic blood pressure &gt; 100 mmHg and/or systolic blood pressure &gt; 180 mmHg screen visit 6 . Patient malignancy screen history malignancy ( except history recurrence malignancy 5 year ) 7 . Female patient whose pregnancy test negative pregnant , lactate , plan become pregnant study 8 . Patient expect require additional diabetic treatment his/her Type 2 diabetes complication study screen visit 9 . Patient history drug abuse 10 . Patient malnutrition , weakness , opinion Investigator , patient drink average 28 unit alcohol per week ( One unit alcohol equal approximately 250 mL beer , 125 mL wine 40 mL spirit ) 11 . Patients take follow concomitant medication : Oral antidiabetic therapy exclude Metformin within 8 week screen Thiazolidinedione class drug within 12 week screen GLP1 analogues/DPP4 inhibitor class drug within 12 week screen ( , follow patient exclude study regardless treatment duration previous DPP4 inhibitor : patient experience failure glucose control treatment DPP4 inhibitor patient expect additional good effect glucose control administration IP accord investigator 's opinion ) Antiobesity agent within 12 week screen All kind insulin administer within 12 week screen Systemic Corticosteroids intermittent use highdose steroid ( inhaler ) Any investigational drug 12 . Patients participate study investigational drug within 12 week Screening currently receive treatment investigational drug study . 13 . The presence condition include clinical laboratory test result lead investigator conclude patient inappropriate inclusion clinical study</criteria>
