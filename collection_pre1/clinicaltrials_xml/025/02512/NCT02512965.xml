	<brief_title>Study Comparing Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy vs Conventional Palliative Radiotherapy ( CRT ) Spinal Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research do evidence suggest SBRT may improve treatment patient spine metastasis , research need determine well CRT . The first part randomize trial ( phase II ) look whether possible ( feasible ) provide treatment cancer centre across Canada , aim recruit 54 participant within 18 month . This part study successfully complete early 2017 . The second component study , call randomized phase III trial , underway . It involve recruit another 98 participant receive either CRT SBRT , use study procedure feasibility study . We continue obtain information whether SBRT good CRT control pain .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologic cytologic diagnosis cancer ( exclude seminoma , small cell lung cancer hematologic primary ) . Spinal metastasis document MRI suitable treatment radiotherapy follow characteristic : Painful , define pain score ≥ 2 bad pain plan target treatment volume ; ≤ 3 consecutive spinal segment involve tumour include plan target volume . The patient may spinal metaastases treat per radiation oncologist 's discretion , eligible spinal metastatic site one pain 3 consecutive segment include clinical target volume appropriate either 20 Gy 5 fraction 24 Gy 2 fraction per randomization . There plan change pain medication first day protocol treatment radiotherapy . ECOG Performance Status 02 . Seen radiation oncologist judge appropriate participation study include ability tolerate protocol radiotherapy ( SBRT CRT ) . Age 18 year old . Patient able willing complete Patient Diary ( pain analgesic use ) . Patient able ( i.e . sufficiently fluent ) willing complete quality life questionnaire either English French . The baseline assessment must complete within require timeline , prior randomization . Inability ( illiteracy English French , loss sight , equivalent reason ) complete questionnaire make patient ineligible study . However , ability unwillingness complete questionnaire make patient ineligible . Patient consent must appropriately obtain accordance applicable local regulatory requirement . Each patient must sign consent form prior enrollment trial document willingness participate . Patients must accessible treatment followup . Investigators must assure patient randomized trial available complete documentation treatment , adverse event , followup . In accordance CCTG policy , protocol treatment begin within 3 week patient randomization . From time successful treatment planning , 12 day elapse first fraction radiotherapy deliver . Women/men childbearing potential must agree use highly effective contraceptive method . A woman consider `` childbearing potential '' menses time precede 12 consecutive month . In addition routine contraceptive method , `` effective contraception '' also include heterosexual celibacy surgery intend prevent pregnancy ( sideeffect pregnancy prevention ) define hysterectomy , bilateral oophorectomy bilateral tubal ligation , vasectomy/vasectomized partner . However , point previously celibate patient choose become heterosexually active time period use contraceptive measure outline protocol , he/she responsible begin contraceptive measure . Women childbearing potential pregnancy test determine eligibility part PreStudy Evaluation ; may include ultrasound ruleout pregnancy falsepositive suspect . For example , betahuman chorionic gonadotropin high partner vasectomize , may associate tumour production hCG , see cancer . Patient consider eligible ultrasound negative pregnancy . Patients pacemaker , MRI perform treatment deliver safely . Patients prior treatment radionuclide within 30 day prior randomization . Patients prior radiation spinal segment intend treat protocol radiotherapy protocol therapy deliver intend . Patients prior surgery spinal segment intend treat protocol radiotherapy . Patients receive chemotherapy within 1 week prior administration protocol radiotherapy expected/planned receive chemotherapy within one week complete protocol radiotherapy . Centre guideline regard administration target noncytotoxic therapy must follow proviso systemic anticancer therapy administer within 24 hour prior postradiotherapy . Endocrine therapy may administer radiotherapy per discretion treat physician . Patients spine instability judge Spinal Instability Neoplastic Score ( SINS ) 12 . Patients symptomatic spinal cord compression cauda equina syndrome result bony compression epidural compression spinal cord cauda equina , respectively . Pregnant lactating woman .</criteria>
