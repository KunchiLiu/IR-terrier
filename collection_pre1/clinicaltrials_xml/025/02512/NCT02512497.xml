	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn give romidepsin stem cell transplant combination fludarabine busulfan help control leukemia lymphoma . Researchers also want learn high tolerable dose romidepsin give combination . The safety combination safety give romidepsin stem cell transplant also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Romidepsin Maintenance After Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Parts Study Drug Dose Levels : If find eligible take part study , start Part 1 study . During Part 1 , receive study drug stem cell transplant . If disease well control transplant still eligible , start Part 2 . During Part 2 , continue receive romidepsin . The study treatment give part describe detail . The dose romidepsin receive depend join study . The first group participant receive low dose level . Each new group receive high dose group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose romidepsin find . All participant receive dose level fludarabine . Busulfan dose level explain . Study Drug Administration Transplant ( Part 1 ) : The day receive stem cell transplant call minus day . The day receive stem cell transplant call Day 0 . The day receive stem cell transplant call plus day . On Days -13 -12 , receive busulfan vein 3 hour . Blood ( 1 teaspoon time ) drawn pharmacokinetic ( PK ) test 11 time 11 hour first busulfan dose . PK test measure amount study drug body different time point . The study staff tell PK test schedule . The test result help doctor decide dose busulfan receive study . A heparin lock line place vein PK test low number needle stick need draws . If reason possible PK test perform , receive standard dose busulfan . On Day -7 , admit hospital . On Day -6 -3 , receive romidepsin vein 4 hour , fludarabine vein 1 hour , busulfan vein 3 hour . PK test 11 time 11 hour also perform Day -6 doctor think need . If go receive transplant match unrelated donor , also receive antithymocyte globulin ( ATG ) vein 4 hour 3 day transplant . This drug design weaken immune system reduce risk reject transplant . Beginning Day -2 , receive tacrolimus vein 24 hour every day able take mouth . Tacrolimus design weaken immune system low risk graft-versus-host-disease ( GVHD - reaction donor 's immune cell body ) . Once able take tacrolimus mouth , take every day 3 month , doctor think safe stop taking . On Day 0 , receive donor 's stem cell vein . The infusion last anywhere 30 minute several hour . On Days +1 , +3 , +6 , +11 , receive methotrexate vein 15 minute . Methotrexate also design weaken immune system low risk GVHD . If doctor think need , give standard drug help low risk side effect . You may ask study staff information drug give risk . Romidepsin Maintenance Therapy ( Part 2 ) : Starting Day +28 Day +100 , eligible Part 2 base disease status , continue receive romidepsin vein 1 hour twice month . You may receive dos MD Anderson oncologist 's office close live . The study doctor discus . Study Visits : As baseline test beginning study ( within 7 day start romidepsin ) , blood ( 4 tablespoon ) draw comparison purpose learn romidepsin may affect disease immune system . If bone marrow aspirate perform time , additional bone marrow aspirate collect test see romidepsin may affect disease immune system . You remain hospital long doctor think need . Whenever doctor think need , blood ( 2 tablespoon ) and/or urine collect routine test . About Â½-1 , 3 , 6 , 12 month transplant : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 8 tablespoon ) drawn see well transplant take learn romidepsin may affect disease immune system . - If doctor think need , bone marrow aspiration check status disease . To collect bone marrow aspirate , area hip site numb anesthetic , small amount bone marrow withdrawn large needle . Additional bone marrow aspirate collect test see romidepsin may affect disease immune system . The tests/procedures may perform sooner , doctor think need . You may also additional test doctor think need . Before first dose romidepsin Parts 1 2 : - You electrocardiogram ( EKG ) check heart function . - Blood ( 4 tablespoon ) drawn learn romidepsin may affect disease immune system . Part blood sample used pregnancy test become pregnant . If Part 2 , every 2 week ( dose romidepsin ) , blood ( 4 tablespoon ) draw routine test . Part blood sample used pregnancy test become pregnant . This may repeat often , doctor think need . If Part 2 , month : - You EKG . - You physical exam . Part 2 participant may blood test do romidepsin dose monthly EKGs physical exam perform either MD Anderson local oncologist 's office . If perform locally , result send study staff . You need return MD Anderson test procedure perform 3 , 6 , 12 month transplant . Length Study : You may receive 4 dos romidepsin Part 1 . You may also receive chemotherapy certain day Day -13 Day -3 , stem cell transplant Day 0 . In Part 2 , may receive 24 cycle romidepsin maintenance therapy part study . Your participation study follow-up visit . After 1 year , routine follow-up transplant doctor . You may take study early doctor think best interest , disease get bad come back , intolerable side effect occur , graft failure ( transplanted cell grow ) , unable follow study direction . If reason want leave study early , must talk study doctor . It may life-threatening leave study start receive study drug receive stem cell transplant blood cell count dangerously low . This investigational study . Romidepsin FDA approve commercially available treatment CTCL patient receive least 1 systemic ( affect whole body ) therapy . Busulfan fludarabine FDA approve commercially available use stem cell transplant . The use combination romidepsin , busulfan , fludarabine treat type leukemia lymphoma consider investigational . Up 30 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
