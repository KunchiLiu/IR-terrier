	<brief_summary>The Psychiatric Emergency Services ( PES ) research area clinical practice , largely management acutely agitate violent patient . The goal pilot randomize clinical trial ( RCT ) ass benefit medically monitor patient present extreme agitation and/or violent behaviour PES . Placing physical restraint immediately administer chemical restraint , enable medical monitoring potentially medically unstable patient . Investigators believe practice provide safe management patient , reduce risk staff patient , reduce risk undiagnosed medical condition underly agitation , increase clinical management quality care . Patients come Emergency Department agitate violent , verbal-deescalation suffice , randomly treat either immediate placement seclusion ( current practice ) place physical restraint give chemical restraint ( outlined BETA project guideline ) . The time interval assessment perform group patient include ; medical monitoring agitation scale assessment . Data also collect number violent episode , code white , required increase use physical restraint , length intervention , . This assessment enable comparison current practice propose practice establish evidence base clinical guideline management acute agitation PES , de-escalation technique ineffective lack medical monitoring harmful patient negatively effect outcome . In order best ass importance medical monitoring patient , pilot study must perform assess feasibility phase III RCT study .</brief_summary>
