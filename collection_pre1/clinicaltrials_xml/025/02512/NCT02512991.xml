	<brief_title>Follow-up Patients Bound PCI After Implementation Helicopter Emergency Medical System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Since 2003 , percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) ST-Segment elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) prefer therapy Denmark fibrinolysis ( thrombolysis ) perform within 120 minute . Nevertheless , centralisation designate PCI-centres may lead system delays transport distance may longer instead choose thrombolysis near hospital . As every minute count try minimize ischemic injury size infarction follow acute coronary event , timely transportation helicopter may facilitate overall prognosis . As part national initiative improve prehospital care patient time critical illness myocardial infarction ( MI ) , first Danish Helicopter Emergency Medical System ( HEMS ) implement eastern part Denmark May 1st 2010 . An initial study 450 patient investigate short-term effect , find HEMS significantly reduce time first electrocardiogram ( ECG ) diagnosis on-scene arrival cardiac catheterisation laboratory ( CCL ) despite long transport distance . Investigators also find low , insignificant 30-day mortality HEMS patient , adjust OR=0.40 ( 95 % CI=0.12-1.39 , p=0.14 ) . The aim present study investigate long-term effect HEMS relation mortality labour market affiliation .</detailed_description>
