	<brief_summary>Social determinant health ( e.g . income , education , environment patient ) may exert great influence health outcome traditional clinical factor ( e.g . lab result , diagnosis , family history ) . Calls integrate primary care public health therefore increase , merge domain care logistically difficult . Research lack incremental benefit add public health data practice level -- improve either health outcome care delivery . This proof concept pilot merge data electronic health record ( EHRs ) community vital sign , set metric describes key community resource affect health . The investigator identify resource poor community , cold spot , base four variable ( education , poverty , life expectancy , access healthy food ) census tract level - refer community vital sign . The hypothesis patient come cold spot likely bad health outcome clinicians deliver good care know patient 's community context his/her specific social need . This study involve 12 primary care practice Northern Virginia care 170,000 patient . Patient address geocoded practice determine patient reside cold spot community vital sign . The variation community vital sign practice 's patient calculate bivariate regression analysis use determine whether come cold spot associate worse clinical quality metric . 15 clinician alert see patient cold spot , patient complete social need survey , clinicians prospectively document survey whether knowledge affect interpersonal interaction ( time spend patient use clear language ) clinical management ( referral care coordination community resource ) . By pragmatically integrate community vital sign care , innovative proposal seek understand community data clinician value , data might influence care , best incorporate data clinical population care .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator integrate community vital sign clinical data , identify cold spot , determine prospectively clinician use community data point care population patient . The investigator hypothesize ( 1 ) patient primary care practice live range community different social determinant health , include cold spots lack health-promoting resource , ( 2 ) community vital sign associate patient health outcome ( e.g. , up-to-date preventive care , control chronic condition , morbidity ) , ( 3 ) know patient resides cold spot help clinician improve patient care . Aim 1a : Determine community vital sign cold spots catchment area 12 primary care practice . Aim 1b : Determine whether patient reside cold spot experience bad outcome , receive inadequate care , bad chronic disease control , high morbidity . Aim 2 : Determine whether know patient 's community vital sign social need point care change clinical management ; explore practice could use community vital sign population care . Aim 3 : Identify community vital sign practice would find useful manage patient .</detailed_description>
