	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Enhancing Response MK-3475 Advanced Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study do test safety effectiveness combination intravenous ( IV ) romidepsin and/or oral CC - 486 IV MK-3475 people microsatellite stable advanced colorectal cancer . The use CC - 486 research study investigational . The word `` investigational '' mean oral form CC - 486 approve market U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . Oral CC - 486 give small number people far , combination never give together people . Romidepsin approve FDA treatment cutaneous T-cell lymphoma ( blood cancer ) . It approve FDA use cancer . MK-3475 antibody . Antibodies proteins immune system use fight infection . Researchers design MK-3475 block PD-1 . PD-1 molecule shut immune response infection cancer cell . An antibody PD-1 stop turn immune response may able boost immune system cancer . People advance colorectal tumor microsatellite stable ( MSS ) may join study . Tumors MSS positive deficient repair DNA . This pilot study look different way make MSS colorectal tumor sensitive MK-3475 give 14 21 day epigenetic agent ( oral CC - 486 and/or romidepsin ) . Participants randomly assign ( chance , like draw number hat ) one three study drug combination : A . Oral CC - 486 take daily 21 day ( later shorten 14 day side effect ) IV MK-3475 give every 2 week . B. IV romidepsin give weekly 3 week IV MK-3475 give every 2 week C. Oral CC - 486 take daily 21 day ( later shorten 14 day side effect ) IV romidepsin give every 2 week IV MK-3475 give every 2 week . Each arm repeat every 28 day continue point study drug longer work . It possible cross onto another arm participant 's disease respond study drug . In study investigator look follow information : - What effect , good and/or bad , combination oral CC - 486 and/or romidepsin combination MK-3475 participant ' cancer ; - If genetic chemical make-up participant ' blood tumor cell play role response oral CC - 486 and/or romidepsin combination MK-3475 .</detailed_description>
