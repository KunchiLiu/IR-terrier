	<detailed_description>This prospective , multi-center study evaluate diagnostic performance characteristic AminoIndex™ technology among patient high risk develop lung cancer compare standard lung cancer screen diagnostic procedure include low-dose CT , high-dose CT , biopsy histopathology . The study enroll patient one three arm : 1. patient lung nodule ( ) ≥ 6 mm ≤ 35 mm biopsied diagnosed primary lung cancer yet initiate treatment kind lung cancer ; 2. patient lung nodule ( ) ≥ 6 mm ≤ 35 mm biopsied determine cancerous OR demonstrate nodule growth &gt; 2 year repeat CT imaging ; 3. patient high-risk lung cancer ( per NLST guideline ) evidence history lung cancer ( negative LDCT/CT/X-ray ) .</detailed_description>
