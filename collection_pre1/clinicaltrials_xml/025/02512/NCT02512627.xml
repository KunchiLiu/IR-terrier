	<detailed_description>Background study aim : Mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) minor neurocognitive disorder syndrome define intermediate stage cognitively intact clinically diagnose dementia . The age-adjusted prevalence MCI Taiwan approximately 18 % , woman high prevalence MCI men . The progression rate MCI dementia range 10 15 % year , 50 % MCI population develop severe cognitive impairment dementia 5 year . Therefore , early detection individual manifest MCI provide appropriate intervention may help reduce burden caregiver medical expense health-care system . Previous study find cognitive training exercise emerge important therapeutic approach individual MCI . However , intervention effect combine exercise cognitive training remain determine . Furthermore , whether exercise cognitive training administer sequential order simultaneously important question pursue . The overall goal study determine compare intervention effect cognitive training , exercise , combine cognitive exercise training individual MCI . Who participate ? Individuals MCI . What study involve ? The participant receive total 36 training session , session contain 90 minute train . Training frequency 2-3 time per week 12-18 week . All participant receive pretreatment test , post treatment test , 6-month follow-up test . What possible benefit risk participate ? The possible benefit include improvement cognitive , physical , daily function . There risk participating . Where conduct study ?
