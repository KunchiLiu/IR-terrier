	<brief_title>Motherhood Pelvic Health ( MAP Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vaginal delivery affect pelvic muscle , nerve connective tissue . Despite similarity vaginal delivery non-pelvic soft tissue injury , research date focus factor related recovery childbirth , instead direct intrapartum intervention . A woman 's pelvic floor derives ability withstand load physical activity due inherent genetic make-up set foundation muscle , connective tissue , bone structure , history injury , ability recover injury . Over past decade , investigator gain important information way vaginal delivery affect structure function pelvic floor . However , investigator know little pelvic floor function recovers vaginal delivery . This study look whether non-pregnant milieu , include physical cultural factor , mediate effect vaginal childbirth . Study investigator propose pelvic floor support symptom 1 year first vaginal delivery affect biologically plausible factor may impact muscle , nerve connective tissue heal postpartum recovery period ( first 8 week postpartum ) pelvic floor function postpartum strengthen period ( remainder first postpartum year ) : particular , time dose moderate/vigorous physical activity inactivity , time exposure range intra-abdominal pressure . Our investigator propose perception pelvic floor support symptom 1 year vaginal delivery influence cultural attribute belief . Finding relationships physical activity , muscular strength , intra-abdominal pressure pelvic floor support /symptoms provide realistic target disease prevention pelvic floor health management . Hispanics fastest-growing ethnic group United States . Although risk pelvic floor disorder differ among ethnic racial group , study examine difference . There critical need research among Hispanic woman . In Program , investigator study personal cultural aspect Mexican-American Euro-American primipara ' experience earliest change happen childbirth make understandable woman clinician , create opportunity dialogue across lay medical discourse . The aim project summarize . PROJECT 1 Intra-abdominal pressure postpartum pelvic floor support symptom By use intra-vaginal sensor measure intra-abdominal pressure primiparous woman , investigator : Aim 1 : Determine whether IAP measure 8 week postpartum ) lifting b ) abdominal muscle endurance test predicts pelvic floor support symptom 1 year postpartum . Aim 2 : Determine whether measure muscular fitness modify effect IAP lift pelvic floor support 1 year postpartum . PROJECT 2 : Physical activity , inactivity , fitness : Impact postpartum pelvic floor support symptom Aims : To determine , primiparous woman vaginal delivery , whether physical activity , sedentary time characteristic body habitus muscular fitness associate 1 ) pelvic floor support 2 ) pelvic floor symptom 1 year postpartum . PROJECT 3 : The cultural context postpartum pelvic floor support follow vaginal delivery : comparative ethnographic analysis Mexican-American Euro-American woman . Aim : To describe primiparous Mexican-American Euro-American woman 's experience cultural knowledge postpartum pelvic floor support change . Sub-aim 1 : To characterize way woman perceive make sense early change pelvic floor support well way use language discourse construct meaning change year first delivery . Aim 1.2 : To describe primipara share experience cultural understanding postpartum pelvic floor support mother , partner , sister , confidante family social network . Sub-aim 1 : To explore interplay woman 's understanding early change pelvic floor support sociocultural prescriptions/proscriptions regard physical activity result postpartum alteration activity may undertake . Estimated enrollment : 1530 woman third trimester obtain final enrollment goal 585 woman 1 year postpartum . ( We estimate , initial enrollment , exclude 26.5 % deliver cesarean , 10 % deliver 37 week , 20 % withdraw delivery 8 week postpartum , 20 % withdraw 8 week 1 year postpartum , 6 % know pregnancy 1 year postpartum , leave 585 final 1-year data . )</detailed_description>
