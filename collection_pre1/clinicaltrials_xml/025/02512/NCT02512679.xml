	<brief_summary>Many genetic disease lymphohematopoietic cell ( sickle cell anemia , thalassemia , Diamond-Blackfan anemia , Combined Immune Deficiency ( CID ) , Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome , chronic granulomatous disease , X-linked lymphoproliferative disease , metabolic disease affect hematopoiesis ) sublethal disease cause mutation adversely affect development function different type blood cell . Although pathophysiologically diverse , genetic disease share similar clinical course significant progressive morbidity , overall poor quality life , ultimate death complication disease palliative treatment . Supportive care diseases include chronic transfusion , iron chelation , surgery ( splenectomy cholecystectomy ) hemoglobinopathies ; prophylactic antibiotic , intravenous immunoglobulin , immunomodulator therapy immune deficiency ; enzyme replacement injection dietary restriction metabolic disease . The suboptimal result supportive care measure lead effort implement aggressive therapeutic intervention cure lymphohematopoietic disease . The logical strategy cure diseases either replacement patient 's hematopoietic stem cell ( HSC ) derive normal donor allogeneic bone marrow transplant ( BMT ) hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( HSCT ) , genetically modify patient 's stem cell replace defective gene ( gene therapy ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The present study evaluate de-escalation cyclophosphamide ( CY ) dose innovative conditioning regimen fludarabine alemtuzumab additional agent achieve immunoablation , combination Busulfan ( BU ) achieve myeloablation . Replacement least part cyclophosphamide dose fludarabine conditioning regimen would expect maintain immunosuppression ( , therefore , engraftment ) reduce transplant-related complication ( mucositis , hepatotoxicity , cardiotoxicity , pulmonary toxicity , hemorrhagic cystitis , mucositis , possibly GVHD ) , thereby improve disease-free survival rate . Similarly , potential benefit alemtuzumab propose condition regimen increase rate hematopoietic engraftment less toxicity observe cyclophosphamide , ultimately result improve immune function enhance quality life ( 12,13 ) . A fludarabine/alemtuzumab-based , less intensive condition regimen adequate immunosuppressive activity could conceivably allow successful engraftment stem cell related donor patient genetic lymphohematological disease , well low rate transplant-related mortality . Regimen-related toxicity also believe major contribute factor GVHD ( 14 ) . Therefore , condition regimen cause less tissue injury may also lead reduce GVHD . In present study , use alemtuzumab condition regimen may add benefit , antibody cause T-cell depletion , thus , risk GVHD may also reduce ( 15 ) . The overall goal study improve therapeutic index HSCT decreasing , possible , eliminate cyclophosphamide component pre-transplant conditioning patient genetic disease lymphohematopoiesis . The investigation explore risk benefit propose novel-conditioning regimen use decrease dose cyclophosphamide additional immunosuppression fludarabine alemtuzumab prevent graft rejection recurrence disease . The investigator evaluate regimen 's impact conditioning-related morbidity mortality , measure success transplant procedure engraftment disease-free survival . If regimen able successfully permit engraftment reduce regimen-related toxicity , next phase treatment test dose de-escalation cyclophosphamide . It anticipate four dose level cyclophosphamide overall study : 1 ) 105 mg/kg ; 2 ) 70 mg/kg ; 3 ) 35 mg/kg ; finally , 4 ) 0 mg/kg . This study design choose minimize study risk possibly associate substitution fludarabine alemtuzumab CY immunoablation . The present protocol represent Level 1 study design ; amend protocol prepared prior de-escalation cyclophosphamide dose .</detailed_description>
