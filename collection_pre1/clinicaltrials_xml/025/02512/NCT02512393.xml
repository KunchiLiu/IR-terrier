	<brief_summary>The purpose research study effect Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation ( tDCS ) clinical pain , mobility disability , pain sensitivity gain well understanding factor cause pain disability people knee osteoarthritis ( OA ) . In particular , people different ethnic racial group may experience OA pain differently focus old Asian Americans non-Hispanic white . It important find reason difference well treatment find OA patient . In addition , research study examine ethnic difference pain mobility disability . The investigator hypothesize Asian Americans report great pain mobility disability non-Hispanic white , active tDCS result improvement pain disability compare sham tDCS .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation Older Persons With Knee Pain ( Knee Pain tDCS ) : Randomized Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>If participate study , follow happen : Randomized one two group . Which either receive full length session brain stimulation much short session brain stimulation . The short version stimulation look like performed way longer electrical stimulation session , stimulation stop much effect brain . You know group assign participate research , may find completion research study . X-Rays do knee stand . Questionnaires arthritis pain , thought feeling , stress may experience . Walking Test perform flat surface 6 minute fast pace without help assistive device ( cane walker ) another person . Assessment Physical Performance require walk short distance ( 13 foot ) , stand chair 5 time without use arm , stand 3 different position keep balance . Assessment Sensitivity Heat . Heat pain sensitivity test use commercially available thermal sensory test machine ( Medoc , Inc. ) use widely clinical setting . This machine small ( 1 inch 1 inch ) square piece use apply heat skin . Heat apply knee arm . The amount heat control computer . One follow type heat stimulus deliver : 1 ) slowly increase heat stop press button become warm , painful , intolerable ; 2 ) series 5-10 heat pulse brief ( le 2 second duration ) , rate painful heat pulse feel ; 3 ) long heat pulse ( 15-30 second ) different temperature rate painful heat pulse feel . The procedure stop time . Assessment Sensitivity Pressure do use handheld device small rubber tip apply pressure knee , thigh , shoulder . Assessment Sensitivity Mechanical Stimulation do use handheld probe small nylon tip tap knee hand . Blood Draw : Blood take baseline visit last visit . Brain Stimulation : The stimulation technique call transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) involve place two sponge-like electrode head deliver weak electrical current scalp , generate 9 volt battery . In addition , weekly phone call do next 3 week .</detailed_description>
