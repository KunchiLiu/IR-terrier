While population clearly need physical activity ( PA ) intervention , date none specifically target MA men . In fact , majority PA intervention Latinos exclusively include woman and/or design around female preferences.The propose study address need barrier PA MA men develop text message-delivered intervention material base Social Cognitive Theory ( SCT ) complement individually tailor , theory-based print material PA intervention Spanish speaking Mexican MA men . Text messaging could particularly effective appeal channel increase PA target population allow participant interaction , real-time accountability , immediate feedback , feature MA men demonstration trial print intervention specifically request . Text-based intervention show improve number health behavior , include PA. A recent review texting intervention find generally well receive effective reduce inactivity , weight , waist circumference,5 meta-analysis find moderate effect size ( g = 0.54 ) use mobile device increase PA . However , trial target underserved population , none specifically target Latinos . Cell phone ownership high Latino adult ( 86 % vs. 84 % non-Latino Whites ) , Latinos actually likely use mobile phone text messaging , 85 % report regularly send receive text ( compare 79 % Whites ) . Thus familiar , convenient channel deliver new intervention material . Additionally , Latinos also face environmental barrier PA , current proposal enhance individually tailor psychosocial print-based material develop material target barrier home work environment . This multi-media , multi-level approach potential broad reach relatively low cost , could help reduce health disparity .</detailed_description>
