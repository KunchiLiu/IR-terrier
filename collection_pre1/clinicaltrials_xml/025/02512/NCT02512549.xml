	<brief_title>A Trial Study Effects Pulmonary Rehabilitation Program Exercise Capacity Quality Life Patients With Severe Form Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease rank among top five cause unnatural death India prevalence continue increase . Widespread habit smoking use biomass fuel lead high prevalence COPD . The loss physical capacity adverse psychosocial effect disorder contribute greatly morbidity mortality . Medicines limit role improve lung function physical capacity patient COPD . Pulmonary rehabilitation ( PR ) aim return patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) high level independent functioning . This achieve provide individually tailor exercise training schedule , education psychosocial support . Pulmonary Rehabilitation define American European Thoracic Societies `` comprehensive intervention base thorough patient assessment follow patient tailored therapy include , limited , exercise training , education , behavior change , design improve physical psychological condition people chronic respiratory disease promote long-term adherence health-enhancing behavior . '' COPD consider multi-systemic disease frequent co-morbidities hence optimal management complex group patient require integrate care principle , pulmonary rehabilitation core component . Patients chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) often decrease physical activity exercise worsen dyspnea . The progressive deconditioning associate inactivity initiate vicious cycle , dyspnea become problematic ever low physical demand . Pulmonary rehabilitation aim break cycle . Benefits pulmonary rehabilitation include decrease dyspnea , improve health-related quality life , few day hospitalization , decrease health-care utilization . As yet , control study use effectiveness pulmonary rehabilitation Indian set optimum train regimen . This study aim look improvement exercise capacity mean objective incremental field exercise test , quality life use validated questionnaire , severity dyspnea , lung function nutritional parameter patient diagnose severe form COPD undergone structure exercise training program . Primary Objective • To assess effect structured outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation intervention six minute walk distance health relate quality life patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . Secondary Objectives • To study effect pulmonary rehabilitation : - Maximum oxygen consumption ( VO2max ) anaerobic threshold ( AT ) - Lung function : measure change FEV1 FVC - Depression , Anxiety Stress score ( DASS ) - BODE ( Body Mass Index , level obstruction , level dyspnea exercise capacity ) index - Anthropometry : BMI MUAC Study design : Randomized Controlled Study Selection subject : Patients diagnose Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease visit outpatient clinic department Pulmonary Medicine Sleep Disorders Inclusion criterion - Patients severe COPD base spirometry ( FEV1 50 % ) presenting pulmonary medicine outpatient clinic modify medical research council ( mMRC ) grade 1 3 . - Those willing participate study Exclusion criterion - Patients long term oxygen therapy candidate long term oxygen therapy - Patients severe orthopedic neurological disorder limit mobility - Exercise induce syncope - Unstable angina recent MI ( within 4 month ) - Diagnosed Cognitive active psychiatric disorder - Comorbidities : uncontrolled hypertension &gt; 180/100 - Recent hospitalization exacerbation within 6 week Sample size location : 80 patient diagnosed COPD presenting department Pulmonary Medicine Sleep Disorders , randomize 40 patient arm base simple random sample method . Study Period : January 2015 November 2017 Follow Up period : 8 week METHODOLOGY I. BASELINE EVALUATION After initial screening patient COPD term severity , feasibility commitment , patient fulfill inclusion exclusion criterion randomize use computer generate random number intervention control group . A baseline chest xray postero-anterior view ( CXR-PA ) view 12-lead electrocardiogram available enrollment study . All patient undergo pulmonary function test ( PFT ) , cardiopulmonary exercise test use incremental cycle ergometry protocol ( CPET ) , six minute walk test ( 6MWT ) , along baseline demographic history relevant clinical information . CPET 6MWT perform two separate day . The six minute walk distance , VO2max maximum work output cycle Saint George Respiratory Questionnaire record . Other nutritional parameter ( mid-upper arm circumference , skin fold thickness ) , Depression Anxiety Stress Score , dyspnea scale body mass index ( BMI ) also calculate record . The 6MWT perform accordance instruction American Thoracic Society , verbal encouragement give distance record . All repeat end 8 week . Tests separate minimum one hour heart rate oxygen saturation return rest value . II . RANDOMIZATION This do use computer generate random number . III . EXERCISE TRAINING After initial baseline evaluation , patient enrol pulmonary rehabilitation program rehabilitation centre locate premise department pulmonary medicine sleep disorder . The total duration program would 12 week , thrice weekly session exercise train minimum one hour duration . Participants complete minimum 10 minute treadmill walk , cycling , upper low limb resistance exercise 4 separated exercise station locate rehabilitation clinic Department Pulmonary Medicine Sleep Disorders . Rest period provide require first 3 session . Second week onwards , participant encourage perform continuous train intensity target 60 % maximum workload till borg dyspnea scale 4 6 reach , maximum 10 minute rest per session breathe retrain exercise perform . It follow structure upper low limb strength exercise ( e.g . sit-to-stand , foot treadling , thigh strengthening ) . Strength train commence perform one set 8-12 repetition exercise progress increase number set one three gradually , target BORG dyspnea fatigue scale 4 6 . Adherence training define completion least 80 % training session . All patient encourage perform daily activity walk stair climb structure upper low limb exercise home . ( Manual/handouts provide ) . A diary provided maintain daily symptom exercise home .</detailed_description>
