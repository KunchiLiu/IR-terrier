	<brief_title>Study Effect Chemotherapy With Cabazitaxel Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , interventional study explore effect Cabazitaxel survival pathway androgen signal tumor microenvironment ( bone marrow ) patient castration resistant metastatic prostate cancer . A total 30 evaluable patient need . An estimated 50 % chance failure harvest evaluable bone marrow biopsy aspirate anticipate base investigator prior experience . Thus total 60 patient accrue study . This provide investigators 80 % power detect effect size least 0.82 , use two-sided paired t-test 0.05 significance level.The change androgen signal ( androgen receptor expression survival pathway marker , baseline 9 week assess paired t-test Wilcoxon signed-rank test . The association serum Prostate-Specific Androgen ( PSA ) bone marrow androgen signal level evaluate use scatter plot spearman 's correlation coefficient . Similar method use explore association circulate androgen bone marrow . Biomarker data also summarize compare baseline treatment use pair t-test Wilcoxon signed-rank test . ECOG change baseline provide treatment period . All Adverse Events ( AE ) grade use National Cancer Institute - Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( NCI-CTCAE ) classification , version 4.3 . Summary table Adverse Events ( AE ) , Treatment Emergent Adverse Event ( TEAE ) , Serious Adverse Events ( SAE ) withdrawal adverse event provide treatment period . Adverse event summarize bad severity grade AEs . All registered subject take least 1 dose agent include safety analysis . Adverse event summarize bad severity grade . AEs , well treatment-emergent AEs , summarize system organ class , preferred term . Investigational Medicinal Products ( IMP ) -related adverse event , adverse event lead death discontinuation treatment , event classify NCI-CTCAE v4 Grade 3 Grade 4 ( moderate/severe rating scale use ) , ( IMP ) -related event , serious adverse event summarize separately .</detailed_description>
