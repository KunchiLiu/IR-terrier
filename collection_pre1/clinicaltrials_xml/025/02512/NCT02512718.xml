	<brief_summary>Children undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation ( HCT ) cancer blood disorder frequently develop gastrointestinal , metabolic infectious complication related preparative high-dose chemotherapy and/or radiation-related toxicity . Parenteral nutrition ( PN ) lipid emulsion commonly require gastrointestinal complication preclude adequate oral enteral intake . PN lipid may increase risk metabolic infectious complication HCT patient inherently immune compromise . Supplementation omega-3 fatty acid link improvement outcomes several population . Provision fish oil lipid emulsion ( FOLE ) , rich omega-3 fatty acid , child undergo HCT innovative nutritional strategy could mitigate metabolic inflammatory side effect HCT treatment . With potential safely maintain essential fatty acid status , normalize blood lipid alleviate inflammatory response illness , use FOLE may reduce risk infection , regimen-related toxicity , morbidity HCT . A randomized , control pilot study propose test safety tolerability FOLE , compare standard lipid emulsion , 20 child hospitalization HCT . Results study provide preliminary data need large clinical trial examine effect FOLE important clinical outcome population . This novel approach nutritional care high-risk group advance clinical knowledge impact FOLE , support investigation nutritional adjunct pediatric cancer treatment .</brief_summary>
