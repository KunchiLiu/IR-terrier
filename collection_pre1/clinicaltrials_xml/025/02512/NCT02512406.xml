	<brief_summary>The purpose study learn patient Tourette Syndrome deal sensory stimulus environment bright light , loud noise , physical sensation shirt tag , etcetera . We compare response patient Tourette Syndrome without Tourette Syndrome . The study aim well characterize sensory processing abnormality sensory modality : The investigator use measure tool base Dunn 's 1997 model sensory processing , Sensory Profile , allow investigator characterize registration response external stimulus , well delineate sensory modality affect . Identifying sensory modality affect may guide future research pathophysiology sensory processing abnormality TS . The investigator also aim correlate sensory processing abnormality presence Obsessive Compulsive Disorder ( OCD ) , Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) , autism spectrum disorder .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>While widely recognize patient tic Tourette Syndrome ( TS ) experience heighten sensitivity abnormal processing internal sensation , also suggest patient tic TS experience abnormal processing external sensations/stimuli . While sensitivity external stimulus appear trigger motor vocal tic , significantly affect quality life . These sensitivity source irritation , discomfort , distraction equally disruptive vocal motor tic . Heightened sensitivity external stimulus abnormality external sensory processing identify neuropsychological disorder autism spectrum disorder , schizophrenia , traumatic brain injury , ADHD , obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD ) . TS often present co-morbid diagnosis include attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD ) currently know whether sensitivity external stimulus due central processing abnormality common disorder . This study 's objective use variety questionnaire determine external stimulus along presence disorder effect sensory processing .</detailed_description>
