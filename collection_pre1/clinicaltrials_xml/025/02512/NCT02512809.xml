	<brief_title>Isoflurane-induced Neuroinflammation Children With Hydrocephalus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background &amp; Significance . Each year , million child receive general anesthesia . Isoflurane , GABA type A ( GABAA ) receptor agonist inhale anesthetic commonly use clinical anesthesia practice worldwide . Anesthetics traditionally assume safe long severe hypotension hypoxia avoid . Interfering balance excitatory inhibitory neurotransmitter develop brain may interfere formation synaptic connection enhance normal apoptotic process lead neuronal pruning may induce neuroinflammation . Such enhanced neuronal pruning neuroinflammation could lead excessive neuronal loss critical time brain development consequently cause later learn disability . Recent report neurotoxicity induce isoflurane trigger significant concern safety agent . Investigations neuroinflammation apoptosis anesthetic exposure human child limit due ethical methodological concern . Studies do largely retrospective , population-based study . Results study mixed , show decline neurocognitive performance , show change . Further , vast majority prospective , hypothesis-driven research undertaken animal model . Developing clinically relevant animal model test resultant hypothesis human critical step determine underlie cause change well identify possible therapeutic target . The investigator hypothesize piglet expose commonly use anesthetic exhibit increase neuroinflammation compare control . It hypothesize child undergo neurosurgery isoflurane anesthesia show evidence increase central nervous system inflammation . Finally , investigator hypothesize significantly less robust inflammation see patient undergo MRI general anesthesia ( surgery ) , indicate role surgical stress modulation isoflurane-induced neuroinflammation . Clinical/Translational Investigation ( NCH ) : Surgery Group . Patients age 0-5 year undergo general anesthesia ventriculoperitoneal shunt ( VPS ) repair CSF serum sample begin surgery ( induction surgical incision ) end surgery ( closure emergence ) . Each patient randomize standardized anesthetic . An additional CSF sample take prior post anesthesia care unit ( PACU ) discharge . These sample analyze describe . Control Group . Patients undergoing diagnostic MRI general anesthesia non-neurologic pathology receive standardize anesthetic . Serum collect begin end procedure analyze inflammation . Short term goal : Demonstrate isoflurane role modulation neuroinflammation human . Determine surgical stress also role modulation inflammation . Develop clinically relevant animal model hypothesis-driven anesthetic neuroinflammation research . Long term goal : Identify anesthetic regimen , , safe use develop brain . Identify therapeutic target prevention treatment anesthetic-induced neuroinflammation . Obtain independent federal funding future research establish experimental neuroscience program Nationwide Children 's campus .</detailed_description>
