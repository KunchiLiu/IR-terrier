	<brief_title>Predictive Values Next Generation Interferon Gamma Release Assays Latent Tuberculosis Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently available blood test latent tuberculosis infection ( LTBI ) identify people previously infect M. tuberculosis . Whilst sensitive specific , use monitor effectiveness treatment LTBI . New blood test ( `` fourth generation Quantiferon test '' ) give complete measurement working immune system , may useful show whether treatment work . These new test yet evaluate clinical practice , usefulness identify people high risk TB disease monitoring treatment unknown . Mass gathering , annual Hajj pilgrimage , may encourage spread infectious disease , include respiratory infection influenza , respiratory syncytial virus , possibly also tuberculosis . However , risk TB infection Hajj reliably measure . It important measure risk pilgrim give suitable advice prevent infection .</detailed_description>
