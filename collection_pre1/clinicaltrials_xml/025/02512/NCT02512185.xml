	<detailed_description>Our primary aim ( ) examine impact pre-treatment frailty 'elder-relevant ' outcome include daily function , objective physical function , fall , quality life ( QOL ) , early treatment discontinuation ; ( b ) determine whether Hurria/Cancer Aging Research Group ( CARG ) tool able predict severe ( grade 3+ ) chemotherapy toxicity men start chemotherapy . Our secondary aim understand impact abiraterone enzalutamide 'elder-relevant ' outcome . This prospective multicentre observational study . The investigator enroll men age 65 old mCRPC start ( ) first-line chemotherapy ; ( b ) abiraterone ; ( c ) enzalutamide . Assessments occur prior start treatment every 2 month thereafter end treatment . As treatment option become complex old men mCRPC , understand predict wide range treatment toxicity important aid decision-making management .</detailed_description>
