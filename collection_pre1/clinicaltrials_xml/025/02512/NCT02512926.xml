	<brief_summary>This study evaluate use carfilzomib combination cyclophosphamide etoposide child relapsed/refractory solid tumor leukemia . The medication cyclophosphamide etoposide standard drug often use together treatment cancer child solid tumor leukemia . Carfilzomib FDA ( Food Drug Administration ) approve United States adult multiple myeloma ( type cancer ) . However , drug approve disease treat study . Since carfilzomib yet use set treat condition , investigator must first find best dose give . The investigator look high dose carfilzomib give safely . Therefore , child take part study receive dose study drug first part trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Carfilzomib Combination With Cyclophosphamide Etoposide Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study find effect , good and/or bad , treatment new combination drug , cyclophosphamide , etoposide , carfilzomib cancer . In part 1 trial , small group child enrol step . The first group give certain dose carfilzomib . If child side effect bad , next small group child enrol receive high dose . This increase dose group people continue find high dose drug give without cause severe unmanageable side effect . Part 2 study enroll additional patient high tolerable dose find Part 1 order get information side effect make sure dose tolerable .</detailed_description>
