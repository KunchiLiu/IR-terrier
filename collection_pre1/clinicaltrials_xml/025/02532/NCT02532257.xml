	<brief_title>Study Ibrutinib Combination With Rituximab Lenalidomide Previously Untreated Subjects With Follicular Lymphoma Marginal Zone Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : Each study cycle 28 day . You take lenalidomide mouth Days 1-21 Cycle 1 . After Cycle 1 , dose lenalidomide increase take mouth Days 1-21 Cycles 2-12 . You return empty leftover lenalidomide capsules/bottles study staff . Do share study drug anyone . You receive rituximab vein 4-6 hour Days 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 Cycle 1 Day 1 Cycles 2-12 . You also receive ibrutinib mouth 1 time every day Cycles 1-12 . You take dose ibrutinib cup ( 8 ounce ) water . Study Visits : On Day 1 Cycle 1 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw dose rituximab biomarker test . Biomarkers find blood/tissue may relate reaction study drug . On Days 8 , 15 , 22 Cycle 1 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . If become pregnant , blood draw also include pregnancy test . - Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw biomarker test Day 15 . On Day 1 Cycles 2 beyond : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . If become pregnant , blood draw also include pregnancy test . - During Cycles 4 7 , MRI PET/CT scan . - During Cycles 2 7 , blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw biomarker test . Women become pregnant irregular menstrual period blood pregnancy test ( 1 teaspoon ) repeat Day 15 every cycle . Length Treatment : You may receive study drug 12 cycle . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study follow-up visit . End-of-Treatment Visits : About 4 week last dose study drug : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 4-6 teaspoon ) draw routine test biomarker test . - You MRI PET/CT scan . You also ask side effect may hospitalize . If become pregnant , pregnancy test take lenalidomide . The test repeat either 28 day last dose ( regular menstrual cycle ) , 14 28 day last dose ( irregular menstrual cycle ) . Follow Up Visits : After End-of-Treatment visit , follow-up visit every 12 week ( ± 2 week ) first year every 24 week ( ± 4 week ) . Follow-up stop 3 year pass since last study participant enrol receive last dose study drug . If complete 12 cycle study treatment , follow-up visit : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - You MRI PET/CT scan . If stop study treatment early disease get bad come back , call ask new therapy start , symptom may , overall health . Each call take 5-10 minute . This investigational study . Ibrutinib FDA approve commercially available treatment patient mantle cell lymphoma ( MCL ) , chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) , Waldenstrom 's macroglobulinemia . Lenalidomide FDA approve commercially available treatment multiple myeloma ( MM ) , mantle cell lymphoma , myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) . Rituximab FDA approve commercially available treatment non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ) . It consider investigational use ibrutinib , lenalidomide , rituximab treat FL marginal zone lymphoma . Up 60 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
