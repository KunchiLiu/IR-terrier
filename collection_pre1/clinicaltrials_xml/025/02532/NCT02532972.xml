	<brief_title>Cochlear Implantation Treatment Single-sided Deafness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal study investigate role CI treat unilateral hearing loss associate tinnitus . Single-sided deafness ( SSD ) afflict approximately 60,000 new patient per year United States . The common cause single-sided loss sudden sensorineural hearing loss , Meniere 's disease , trauma , vestibular schwannoma . Patients SSD face significant difficulty communicate presence background noise sound localization . Another significant problem SSD patient tinnitus , incapacitate therapy available consider sufficient reliability become standard care . Difficulty hear background noise increase tinnitus lead significant frustration social situation contribute increase isolation decrease quality life . Treatment option single side deafness United States include contralateral routing signal ( CROS ) hearing aid , bone-anchored hearing aid ( BAHA ) use assistive device improve signal-to-noise group situation . The first two device take sound affect ear transmit unaffected ear . The last device consist speaker wear microphone rout signal directly patient 's ear louder listen level . Although device improve speech understanding patient , study show use device ameliorate tinnitus sound localization difficulty . Recent European study demonstrate cochlear implantation ( CI ) provide significant improvement perceive hear ability measure speech comprehension localization adult pediatric patient unilateral hearing loss . This suggest CI may effective option patient population CROS , BAHA assistive device .</detailed_description>
