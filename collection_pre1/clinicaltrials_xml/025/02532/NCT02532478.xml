	<brief_title>Fortune Temporary Ileostomies Patients After Rectal Cancer Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Defunctioning stoma commonly form order divert bowel stream mostly case distal anastomosis , particularly low anterior resection . It report temporary ileostomy may decrease risk anastomotic leak , lethal complication . In addition , case anastomotic leak , stoma may limit septic sequence may help diseased anastomosis heal area inflammation resolve . Stomas also show decrease necessity urgent reoperation due septic intra-abdominal complication may occur anastomotic leak . Many believe stoma complication generally easily manage reversal stoma associate limited morbidity . Thus , selective routine creation divert stoma recommend patient underwent low anterior resection . The risk factor stoma reversal failure rarely study , probably one bad scenario case sphincter preserve procedure rectal cancer expect regular bowel movement functional anus . Several study analyze particular issue show 30 % 'temporary ' stoma never close . However data criticize heterogeneous , since include patient benign malignant disease , case underwent elective emergent anterior low anterior resection restorative proctocolectomy ; colostomy ileostomy , even end stoma subject . In addition , study underline risk factor failure stoma reversal , also similar limitation mention . Finally , survival -to best investigator ' knowledge- never separately studied patient receive stoma reversal procedure . Thus , current study aim present single-surgeon experience regard rate divert ileostomy takedown , factor adversely affect stoma reversal rate patient underwent laparoscopic low anterior resection rectal cancer , accordingly expose fortune case .</detailed_description>
