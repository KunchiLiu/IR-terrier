	<brief_summary>The goal study establish genetic registry patient early-onset motor neuron neuromuscular disease . The investigator collect sample patient motor neuron neuromuscular disorder family member . The sample collect obtain use either non-invasive ( saliva buccal swab ) minimally invasive ( whole blood ) mean . The research team extract high quality genomic DNA sample use identify confirm novel gene mutation identify gene regulate severity motor neuron/neuromuscular disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Diseases affect motor unit -- composed motor neuron , myelin sheath innervate muscle fiber -- diverse , heterogeneous group heterogeneous clinical presentation genetic cause . Many disorder inherit component . In case , genetics underlie give neuromuscular/motor neuron disease , like spinal muscular atrophy ( SMA ) Duchenne muscular dystrophy , well characterize . There , however , disorder whose genetic basis yet determine genetically characterize disease harbor novel mutation . The purpose genetic registry catalogue early-onset motor neuron neuromuscular disorder determine genetic base . With sample obtain registry , investigator able provide genetic diagnosis specific neuromuscular/motor neuron disease lead well care patient affect disease . Many disorder wide spectrum phenotypic variability . For example , severity SMA quite variable even though caused loss single gene , i.e . survival motor neuron 1 ( SMN1 ) . The number copy duplicate gene survival motor neuron 2 ( SMN2 ) dictate phenotypic severity SMA . In study , research team also identify potential modifier phenotypic severity specific disorder like SMA Charcot-Marie-Tooth ( CMT ) disease . With identification novel modifier gene , investigator able accurately predict disease outcome investigator also novel target development therapeutic agent disease .</detailed_description>
