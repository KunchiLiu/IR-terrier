	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate effect perform breathe muscle warm exercise patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . The main aim see whether perform breathe muscle warm improve distance walk 6 minute walk test also decrease perception effort breathlessness .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Respiratory Muscle Warm-up Prior Exercise Patients With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study follow counter-balanced repeat measure design involve six visit exercise laboratory . Following pre-screening familiarisation ( visit 1 2 ) , participant perform inspiratory warm , expiratory warm , combination warm control trial ( visit 3 - 6 ) counter-balanced order separate least 48 hour trial . The four separate session contain : lung function measurement assess perform breathe manoeuvre mouthpiece ( spirometery body plethysmography ) perform breathe muscle warm breathing resistance small handheld device ( PowerLung ) . Participants ask perform second set lung function measurement ask perform 6 minute walk test wear face mask portable device ( gas analysis ) , small device clip finger ( pulse oximeter ) wear heart rate monitor . During 6 minute walk test participant also ask rate perceive effort level breathlessness 60m interval . Following test period seat rest wear face mask portable device 20 minute one set lung function measurement .</detailed_description>
