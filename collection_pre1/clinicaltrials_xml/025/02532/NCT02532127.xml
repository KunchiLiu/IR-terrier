	<brief_summary>Cone Beam Computed Tomography ( CBCT ) emerge X-ray technology find wide application dentomaxillofacial imaging . The ability provide high-resolution 3D image result significant increase volume dental radiology procedure . Although CBCT associate high radiation risk patient conventional dental X-ray imaging ( intraoral panoramic ) , consider 'low dose ' imaging define High Level Expert Group ( HLEG ) dose range microsieverts ( Î¼Sv ) millisieverts ( mSv ) per examination . This proposal set tackle important issue raise HLEG Multidisciplinary European Low Dose Initiative ( MELODI ) platform . In particular , deduce name DIMITRA ( Dentomaxillofacial paediatric imaging : investigation towards low dose radiation induce risk ) , project focus uncertainty associate radiation-induced health risk low dos paediatric dentistry multidisciplinary effort approach involved risk different yet interrelate perspective : radiobiological characterisation , dosimetric quantification , epidemiological surveying image quality &amp; dose optimization . A unique Monte Carlo simulation ( MC ) framework use accurately calculate organ dos dental CBCT imaging , quantify radiation induce risk feed radiobiology team appropriate data towards identification , development validation biomarkers radiation induce health effect . Furthermore , constitute basis upon set gender age relate epidemiology study . The balance image quality dose level explore aim reduce risk image quality optimization . It expect DIMITRA ` outcome deliverable present wide forum via dissemination meeting , lead recommendation potential future adaptation use CBCT paediatric dentistry .</brief_summary>
