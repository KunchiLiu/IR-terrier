	<brief_summary>This study prospective multicenter evaluation performance InterGraft System anastomosis hemodialysis graft . The InterGraft System include arterial InterGraft ( AIG ) connector venous InterGraft ( VIG ) connector use standard arterial-venous ( AV ) graft . The study intend demonstrate 6 month cumulative patency graft connect InterGraft Connectors similar graft connect use standard suture anastomosis . In addition , study also include separate cohort 25 subject VIG use venous anastomosis , together standard suture arterial anastomosis , situation target artery suitable use AIG .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This pivotal multicenter , prospective , non-randomized adaptive design study . The plan study enrollment minimum 104 evaluable subject require AV graft placement hemodialysis meet entry criterion . However , study allow maximum enrollment 252 subject , include 185 evaluable subject , 30 roll-in case , 25 subject separate cohort study ( describe ) , provision 12 subject lose follow-up . Roll-in case include primary analysis , analyze separately . This maximum number subject allow upward adjustment sample size , warrant , base pre-specified midpoint evaluation primary endpoint . Additional subject may enrol maximum 185 evaluable subject review interim analysis result . In addition main study , separate study cohort may enroll 25 subject VIG use venous anastomosis , together standard suture arterial anastomosis . Such subject may identify base pre-surgery imaging time surgery ( e.g. , case subject meet initial inclusion criterion , target artery determine unsuitable anastomosis AIG time surgery ) . Data cohort include primary analysis , analyze separately . The study include 15 participate clinical center . Study site investigator physician skilled AV access graft placement interventional technique . Study data collect point subject complete 6 month endpoint .</detailed_description>
