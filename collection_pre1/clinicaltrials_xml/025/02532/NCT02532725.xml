	<brief_summary>Obesity associate many undesirable health effect disease , middle age associate increase risk disease . Unfortunately , others look effect obesity , gender , middle age , combine effect obesity middle age men 's ability work hot industrial environment satisfactorily investigate . This small study evaluate heat tolerance lean obese middle age men exercise rest way compensate dissipate increase environmental heat heat generate body exercise . As obesity worldwide public health crisis population many industrialize nation age , important understand combine effect obesity middle age men ability safely work hot environment . Such information permit establish revise safe work standard inform public health outreach target population , .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The present study initially approve conduct The Pennsylvania State University 1972 senior author 's ( Rodger J McCormick ) D.Ed . thesis Biological Sciences ; fund support provide US National Institute Arthritis , Metabolism , Digestive Diseases Grant AM-08311 National Institutes Health Grant 01748 . Data re-analysis representation study first approve 2011 conduct FSRG deGruyter-McKusick Institute Health Sciences partial fulfillment MS Clinical Applied Physiology pursue junior author ( Mikaela I Poling ) . No funding receive use exist data . Importance Present Study : Several heat tolerance study , include Kenny , Gagnon , Dorman , Hardcastle , Joy ( 2010 ) , indicate middle-age men perform hard work hot environment nearly well young men . Dufour Candas ( 2007 ) , compare passive heat response sudomotor function young , middle age , old men , find local , global , decrease sweat gland output two old group , suggest least significant preservation sudomotor function . Since study employ subject lean normal body type , result term physiological reaction heat stress may applicable obese middle age men . Other study demonstrate degrade heat stress exercise capacity obese person . Within high heat stress area steel , fiberglass , aluminium , mining , professional sport , defense industry , lean obese middle age men readily observe perform work task hot environment . Little attention give difference lean obese middle age men physiological response combination internal heat production work task perform heat load impose external environment . In present study , occupational heat stress endurance difference lean obese middle age men effect obesity investigate laboratory simulated condition test follow hypothesis : ( 1 ) great baseline cardiovascular demand , expect obese middle age men reduce environmental heat tolerance gain store total heat ; ( 2 ) poor environmental heat tolerance obese middle age men greatly magnify work ( produce add metabolic heat ) ; ( 3 ) lean middle age men thermoregulate well ; ( 4 ) lean middle age men show , , major sign inability compensate add cardiovascular demand ; ( 5 ) obese middle age men function high percentage maximal ventilation expire oxygen ; ( 6 ) obese middle age men poorer pulmonary fitness , measure maximal ventilation expire oxygen , lean middle age men .</detailed_description>
