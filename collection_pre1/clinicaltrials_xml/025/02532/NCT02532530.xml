	<brief_summary>Delirium acute brain syndrome characterized disturbance consciousness accompany period inattention change cognition . Memory impairment , irrelevant speech disorientation commonly observe sign symptom . Episodes delirium associate prolonged hospital stay , functional cognitive dysfunction even increase mortality . Delirium common complication postoperative set incidence increase risk surgery . The estimated incidence postoperative delirium cardiovascular surgery remarkable , range 31 % 51 % . Diverse preoperative risk factor document patient undergo cardiac surgery : age , pre-existing cognitive dysfunction , history alcohol abuse severity illness admission . An early diagnosis postoperative delirium great importance prevent long-term cognitive impairment . For purpose , highly specific diagnostic monitoring tool implement perioperative cardiac surgery care . Near infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) provide information brain oxygenation quantify regional cerebral oxygen saturation ( SctO2 ) microvascular level . Recently , two study show preoperative cerebral tissue oxygenation lower cohort patient develop delirium postoperatively . Nevertheless , study investigate whether onset postoperative delirium coincide change postoperative SctO2 . A relationship delirium reduce cerebral blood flow already suggest . As , occurrence postoperative decrease SctO2 might overlook thus far . Hence , Investigators want conduct prospective , interventional study determine relationship postoperative SctO2 onset delirium cardiac surgery .</brief_summary>
