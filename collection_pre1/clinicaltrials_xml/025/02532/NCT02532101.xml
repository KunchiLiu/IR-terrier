	<brief_title>Modulating Effects Oil Palm Phenolics Uncontrolled Insulin-treated Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetes Mellitus global health issue cause significant mortality morbidity . According Diabetes Atlas , Middle East region currently lead high number diabetic patient , Malaysia rapidly catch estimate prevalence 12.2 % ( ~3.3 million patient ) 2035 . In Malaysia , First National Health Morbidity Survey ( NHMS I ) conduct 1986 report prevalence diabetes mellitus 6.3 % , increase 8.2 % Second National Health Morbidity Survey ( NHMS II ) conduct 10 year later , 1996 . By 2006 , prevalence diabetes among Malaysian population age 18 year risen 11.6 % ( NHMS III ) figure rise 15.2 % year 2011 ( NHMS IV ) . Type 2 diabetes complex metabolic disorder associate insulin resistance , impaired insulin signal β-cell dysfunction , abnormal glucose lipid metabolism , sub-clinical inflammation increase oxidative stress ; metabolic disorder lead long-term pathogenic condition include micro- macro-vascular complication neuropathy , retinopathy , nephropathy , stroke , myocardial infarction consequent decrease quality life increase rate mortality . Based current understanding pathophysiology insulin resistance type 2 diabetes , multiple pharmacological non-pharmacological intervention develop aim improve glycemic control prevention diabetes complication , include use functional food bioactive component . Recent study suggest potential polyphenols supplementary treatment diabetes mellitus owe biological property . Polyphenols natural phytochemical compound find fruit vegetable . The common group phenolic compound diet phenolic acid flavonoid . The two main class hydroxybenzoic acid derivative hydroxycinnamic acid derivative . Polyphenols gain popularity due various health-promoting effect include blood glucose modulation . The potential efficacy polyphenols glucose homeostasis carbohydrate metabolism aggressively investigated vitro , animal model clinical trial . The anti-hyperglycemic property polyphenols mainly contribute reduction dietary carbohydrate absorption intestine , improvement β-cell function insulin action , stimulation insulin secretion , modulation enzyme involve glucose metabolism , anti-oxidative anti-inflammatory effect . The key enzyme responsible digestion dietary carbohydrate glucose α-glucosidase α-amylase . One well-known property polyphenols especially phenolic acid carbohydrate metabolism inhibition enzyme . Some investigation show polyphenols also able regulate postprandial glycemia inhibit development glucose intolerance facilitate insulin response increase secretion glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide ( GIP ) glucagonlike polypeptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) . In addition , polyphenols able regulate key pathway involve carbohydrate metabolism hepatic glucose homeostasis . These include glycolysis , glycogenesis gluconeogenesis , usually impaired diabetes . In study use diabetic rat , ferulic acid , hydroxycinnamic acid derivate , find effectively increase plasma insulin suppress blood glucose level elevate glucokinase activity production glycogen liver . Supplementation diabetic rat citrus bioflavonoids , accompany increase hepatic glucokinase activity glycogen content , attenuate hepatic gluconeogenesis via decrease activity glucose-6-phosphatase phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase ( PEPCK ) , subsequent improvement glycemic control . Green tea polyphenols show attenuate hyperglycemia hepatic glucose output via regulation expression liver glucokinase upregulation PEPCK . In vitro study , epigallocatechin gallate ( EGCG ) , one abundant catechins green tea , activate AMP-activated protein kinase require pathway inhibition gluconeogenic enzyme expression . Dietary polyphenols also influence peripheral glucose uptake insulin sensitive non-insulin sensitive tissue . One study show phenolic acid stimulate glucose uptake effective metformin thiazolidinediones , main common oral hypoglycemic drug use diabetic patient . Other in-vitro study show polyphenols quercetin , resveratrol epigalocatechin gallate improve insulin-dependent glucose uptake muscle cell adipocytes translocation glucose transporter plasma membrane mainly induction AMP-activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) pathway . AMPK key role metabolic control important sensor cellular energy status . The activation pathway consider new treatment obesity , type 2 diabetes , metabolic syndrome main target anti-diabetic drug include metformin . Interestingly , effect polyphenols activation AMPK report 50-200 time metformin . Hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress pancreatic β-cells play pivotal role development diabetes . It believe polyphenols able protect β-cells damage secondary hyperglycemia oxidation . Oral administration phenolic-rich chestnut extract diabetic rat favourable effect serum glucose viability β-cell attenuation oxidative stress , enhance natural antioxidant system , inhibition lipid peroxidation . Some protective effect polyphenols β-cells related ability modulate key cellular signalling pathway . The anthocyanin-rich Chinese bayberry extract show protective effect pancreatic β cell oxidative damage up-regulation heme oxygenase-1 , modulation ERK1/2 PI3K/Akt signal pathway inhibition β cell apoptosis . The current study focus glucose-controlling property phenolic compound extract oil palm ( Elaeis guineensis ) , high oil-producing tropical plant also rich phytochemical . The technology harvest water-soluble antioxidant oil palm recently develop enable recovery oil palm phenolic ( OPP ) vegetation liquor palm oil mill process.. The major phenolic component OPP identify caffeoylshikimic acid , protocatechuic acid p-hydroxybenzoic acid . OPP find exert various positive health effect parallel well-established physiological benefit polyphenols . It show OPP protect early type 2 diabetes encouraging result suggest role modulating development diabetes . The current study aim investigate determine effect oil palm phenolic ( OPP ) blood glucose control patient uncontrolled insulin treat type 2 diabetes mellitus . A Phase I clinical trial ( NMRR ID : NMRR-08-1618-3108 ) conduct 2011 aim evaluate health benefit OPP evaluate adverse reaction OPP preparation healthy volunteer . The study use dose 150 ml 1500 ppm GAE , twice daily , i.e . 450 mg GAE per day , involve 25 healthy volunteer show serious adverse effect . Study report provide OPP 900 1800 mg/lGAE ad libitum Nile rat block diabetes progression spontaneous diabetes model . Based average rat weight 300 g 30-35ml/day OPP consumption , average equivalent consumption 60kg human subject would 1000 ml , calculate base body surface area normalisation method . Thus , order exert clinically significant effect , current study apply 1000 mg GAE per day . Doses high 3000 mg/l GAE rat ( translate 3000mg GAE consumption per day human ) show adverse effect .</detailed_description>
