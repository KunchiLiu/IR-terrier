	<brief_title>Evaluation ARI-3037MO , Suppress LDL Cholesterol Patients With Dyslipidemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study prospective , multi-center , randomize , double-blinded , control clinical trial . The study compare two arm : ARI-3037MO 3 g BID vs. placebo . Subjects sign informed consent enrol undergo Visit 1 assessment . Following evaluation Visit 1 laboratory assay , eligible subject receive phone call ( Visit 2 ) instruct begin lifestyle modification enter 4- 6-week lead-in period ( 6-week wash-out period subject wash non-statin lipid-lowering therapy [ subject may remain statins period ] , 4 week subject receive statin receive lipid-lowering therapy ) , follow qualify fast LDL-C measurement Visit 3 . After lead-in period , LDL-C level Visit 3 ≥ 100 mg/dL , additional week allow another qualify measurement subsequent visit ( Visit 3.1 ) . If perform , LDL-C level Visit 3.1 must ≥ 100 mg/dL order subject continue participation study . Qualifying subject randomize 1:1 manner Visit 4 one two arm double-blind , 24-week efficacy safety assessment phase . Randomization stratify background statin therapy status Visit 1 ( yes/no ) . Baseline lipid level define lipid level Visit 4 . End-of-study lipid level define lipid level Visit 7 ( Week 24 ) . A final closeout safety assessment visit hold 26 week post randomization ( Visit 8 ) .</detailed_description>
