	<brief_title>The Research Standard Diagnosis Treatment HSPN Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Henoch-Schonlein purpura nephritis ( HSPN ) one common complication Henoch-Schonlein purpura , become one main cause chronic kidney disease child . However , diagnosis treatment HSPN still base clinical experience , lack evidence-based support . This study perform explore biological marker early prediction prognosis evaluate efficacy safety various measure treatment HSPN child . The patient prove get HSPN renal biopsy give prednisone 2mg/kg/d , randomize receive cyclophosphamide pulse i.v. , mycophenolate mofetil p.o . leflunomide p.o. , follow 2.5 year compare efficacy safety measure monitor several index .</detailed_description>
