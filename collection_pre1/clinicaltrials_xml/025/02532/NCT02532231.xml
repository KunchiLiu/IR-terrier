	<brief_title>Nivolumab Acute Myeloid Leukemia ( AML ) Remission High Risk Relapse</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : Each study cycle 28 day . If participant find eligible take part study , receive nivolumab vein 1 hour Days 1 15 cycle . After Cycle 6 , participant may receive nivolumab 1 time month . After participant study 1 year , may receive study drug 1 time every 3 month . If time , disease appear get bad , participant may go back receive study drug Days 1 15 cycle . The study doctor discus participant . On Day 1 Cycle 1 , participant stay clinic 2 hour end infusion study staff check health . After , participant stay clinic 1 hour end infusion . Study Visits : One ( 1 ) time week Cycle 1 , one time Cycles 2 3 , every 8-12 week Cycle 6 , participant physical exam . If participant continue therapy Cycle 6 , physical exam every 2-3 month . One ( 1 ) time week Cycle 1 , every 2 week Cycles 2 3 , 1 time cycle , blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . These test may do often participant 's doctor think need . On Day 28 Cycles 1 , 3 , 5 one time every 3 month , participant bone marrow aspiration check status disease cytogenetic testing . Length Study : Participant may continue receive study drug long doctor think best interest . Participant longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Patient 's participation study complete End-of-Treatment Visit . End-of-Treatment Visit : Within 30 day participant 's last dose study drug : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - If do within last 6 week doctor think possible , participant bone marrow aspirate check status disease cytogenetic testing . If participant come clinic End-of-Treatment visit , call study staff ask health . This call last 5-10 minute . This investigational study . Nivolumab FDA approve commercially available treatment melanoma . It consider investigational use nivolumab treat AML . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 30 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
