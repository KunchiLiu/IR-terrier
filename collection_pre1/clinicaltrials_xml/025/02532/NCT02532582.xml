	<brief_summary>The purpose study ultimately prevent injury nerve surgical procedure . Living donor liver transplant hepatectomy ( removal piece liver ) patient receive arterial line standard care . The arterial line help monitor blood pressure along compression important vessel surgery . In addition , research participant undergo neuromuscular monitoring use Somato-Sensory Evoked Potential ( SSEP ) Evoked Potential Assessment Device ( EPAD ) . During operation , neuromuscular monitoring tell doctor nerve study work normally risk injury . This study help investigator understand kind monitoring best prevent nerve injury surgical procedure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>As standard care , research participant undergo live donor liver transplant liver surgery receive right-sided radial arterial line monitor his/her blood pressure along compression important vessel surgery . These measurement capture throughout surgical procedure . If blunting arterial line wave form occurs , anesthesiology team alert surgical team release retractor wave form return baseline . Depression radial arterial line wave form capture , time-stamped , store research transplant anesthesiology team . Additionally part research , participant receive neuromuscular monitoring use SSEP EPAD measure nerve signal surgery ( 3-6 hour ) . SSEP EPAD measurement occur median ulnar nerve capture throughout surgical procedure . The research neuromonitoring team consist highly skilled technician , monitor patient neurosurgical orthopedic surgery . SSEP EPAD output capture surgery time-stamped , store , interpreted Neurologist . To investigate correlation exists , SSEP EPAD abnormality correlate analyzed arterial wave form depression . To determine whether correlation exist clinical outcome , prospective medical record review conduct . Before perform prospective medical record review , authorize research personnel obtain informed consent participant .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>All adult live liver donor liver surgery patient Northwestern Memorial Hospital ( surgical setup similar living liver donor surgery liver surgery ( e.g . retractor , arterial line monitoring , surgeon ) . Investigators approach live liver donor liver surgery patient enrollment receive additional neuromuscular monitoring . All subject must give sign , informed consent prior registration study . Anyone meeting inclusion criterion .</criteria>
