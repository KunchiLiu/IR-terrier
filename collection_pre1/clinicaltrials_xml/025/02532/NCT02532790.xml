	<detailed_description>Henoch-Schonlein purpura nephritis ( HSPN ) one common complication Henoch-Schonlein purpura , become one main cause chronic kidney disease child . However , diagnosis treatment HSPN still base clinical experience , lack evidence-based support . This study perform explore biological marker early prediction prognosis evaluate efficacy safety various measure treatment HSPN child . The patient prove get HSPN renal biopsy randomize receive either prednisone p.o . angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ( ACEI ) p.o . We follow 2.5 year compare efficacy safety measure monitor several index .</detailed_description>
