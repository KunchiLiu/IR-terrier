	<brief_summary>Improving hospital-to-home care transition produce improvement patient safety health care outcome , decrease medical cost . Most transition research examine strategy old patient . This project , however , focus young , high-risk patient within safety net system . The propose intervention base research patient activation , measure Patient Activation Measure ( PAM ) , correlate risk hospital readmission . The intervention seek increase PAM score employ Transition Coach coach patient , prior 30-days discharge , ( 1 ) improve self-management skill goal set goal attainment ; ( 2 ) enhance patient capacity engage trust relationship Primary Care Provider ( PCP ) , medical specialist , family member friend , Transition Coach ; ( 3 ) improve ability navigate medical system . The investigator conduct randomize trial determine ; ( ) PAM score increase 30-day hospital discharge ; ( b ) increase PAM score , set , correlate change healthcare utilization pattern ; ( c ) intervention present viable strategy change healthcare utilization pattern reduce rehospitalizations .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patient Activation define `` knowledge , skill , confidence , inclination assume responsibility manage one 's health healthcare need . '' The 10-item version Patient Activation Measure ( PAM ) demonstrate valid tool measure patient activation range patient population . Evidence demonstrate PAM score correlate heath care outcomes targeted intervention modify PAM score improve outcomes . Highly activate patient , base PAM score , less likely experience 30-day readmission , low level activation high rate rehospitalization . The investigator propose intervention support young adult patient transition hospital home assume increase self-care responsibility . While hospitalization tends promote passive receipt care , intervention support patient take active role . A Transition Coach assist patient prepare discharge enhance ability self-manage medication , follow-up appointment , symptom , community service , personal goal . The investigator hypothesize intensified pre-discharge involvement improve self-management skill young high-risk patient ; ( ) improve PAM score , ( b ) improve post-discharge engagement medical , psychiatric community-based care ; ( c ) present strategy change healthcare utilization pattern maximize outpatient care reduce inpatient care , include hospital readmission . Patient Selection : Cambridge Health Alliance ( CHA ) public safety-net system serve ethnically diverse , underserved patient population 30 % non-English speaking 87 % publically insure . Our target group high risk hospitalize medical patient age 60 young , discharge home receive primary care within CHA network . Patients consider high risk previous inpatient admission multiple Emergency Department ( ED ) visit within past year , serve proxy complicate medical psychosocial issue . Patients select Medicine Surgical Services Cambridge Hospital . Study Protocol : The study protocol describe . 1 . The investigator anticipate enrol 100 intervention patient 100 control patient 9 month . 2 . A research assistant ( RA ) administer Patient Activation Measure intervention patient control patient , immediately randomization . 2- The intervention occur select patient . 3- RA administers post-discharge PAM patient 31 day discharge . Statistical Analysis : Data extract Electronic Medical Record ( EMR ) study patient . Baseline data include age , sex , insurance status , Charlson comorbidity score , mental health substance abuse disorder , marital status , homelessness , address change , admission ED visit past year . Modest sample size may limit ability observe statistically significant effect . The PAM score calculate scale 0 100 ( high activation ) , score typically convert four-category categorical scale . Based previous work safety net settings,18 investigator expect 45 % control patient PAM score Level 4 ( highly activate ) . With 100 intervention 100 control patient , assume two-sided alpha=0.05 , investigator would 89 % power detect 20 % increase percentage highly activate patient intervention group , 65 % power detect 15 % increase . A key outcome outpatient visit within 7 day discharge . Based current work , 15 % control patient group complete 7-day visit . The investigator would 81 % power detect increase 15 % visit rate intervention group , 50 % power detect 10 % increase . Study Hypothesis : The investigator expect observe positive gain PAM score follow intervention , increase 7-day outpatient follow-up rate reduction 30-day readmission .</detailed_description>
