	<brief_title>Pacritinib Combined With Decitabine Cytarabine Older Patients With AML</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-center , open label , two-arm phase II study clinical activity pacritinib old patient newly diagnose AML combine either decitabine cytarabine . In study , approximately 61 patient enrol Weill Cornell Medical College . Arm A consist pacritinib decitabine enroll 31 subject , Arm B consist pacritinib cytarabine enroll 30 subject . Arm A B enroll sequentially . The dose pacritinib 200mg twice day continuously . Arm A : Each cycle : Decitabine 20mg/m2 intravenous daily 10 day combine ongoing pacritinib 200 mg twice daily . Arm B : Each cycle : Cytarabine 20mg subcutaneous twice daily 10 day combine ongoing pacritinib 200mg twice daily . Treatment may give outpatient basis hospitalization otherwise require . Every effort make give decitabine cytarabine consecutively 10 day ; however interruption need , discussion hold medical monitor investigator . The first day cycle define day decitabine cytarabine start . First treatment take place Cycle 1 , day 1 . Hydroxyurea may use investigator 's discretion first 28 day Cycle 1 maintain WBC &lt; 30,000/µl . Bone marrow biopsy aspiration perform day 22-56 cycle subsequent treatment cycle start day 22-56 , investigator 's discretion . Ideally , cycle administer 28-day interval , treatment delay decitabine cytarabine 56 day permit allow resolution non-hematologic non-disease-related hematologic toxicity . Granulocyte-stimulating cytokine support permit investigator 's discretion event neutropenic fever/sepsis per ASCO guidelines.16 Bone marrow aspiration biopsy perform within 5 day peripheral blood count recovery absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1000/µL platelet ≥ 100,000/µL without transfusion , day 28 whichever come first . If peripheral blood absolute blast count ≥ 5000/µL day 21 first cycle , second cycle may administer immediately bone marrow aspiration biopsy . Each arm enroll Simon 's two-stage design describe Section 8 . In Arm A , 16 subject initially enter study , 6 few respond , Arm A terminate early study proceed Arm B . In Arm B , 15 subject initially enter study , 2 few respond , study terminate early . Duration study therapy Patients receive minimum 4 cycle treatment unless evidence unacceptable regimen-related toxicity unequivocal disease progression investigator specifically recommend alternative therapy . Pacritinib continue throughout study . Arm A : Patients achieve CR , CRp , CRi receive subsequent cycle decitabine monthly basis decitabine 20mg/m2 IV daily 5 day pacritinib . Patients achieve complete remission , respond treatment ( partial response , hematologic response , clinical benefit determine investigator ) receive four 10-day cycle decitabine pacritinib indicate study design , follow monthly maintenance cycle decitabine 20mg/m2 IV daily 5 day + daily pacritinib . The maintenance cycle continue indefinitely relapse toxicity . Patients may take study allogeneic stem cell transplantation discretion investigator . Arm B : Patients continue cytarabine 20mg subcutaneous twice daily 10 day combine pacritinib 4 cycle achieve CR , CRp , CRi . Those patient achieve CR , CRp , CRi 4 cycle may continue receive monthly maintenance cytarabine 20mg subcutaneous twice daily 10 day pacritinib . The maintenance cycle continue indefinitely relapse toxicity . Patients may take study allogeneic stem cell transplantation discretion investigator . Screening ( Study Day -14 Day 1 ) Initiate complete screening activity within 14 day Cycle 1 , Day 1 treatment . Treatment ( Cycle 1 , Day 1 End-of-Treatment Visit ) This period begin day patient first receives treatment end End-of-Treatment Visit . Follow-up After completion End-of-Treatment Visit , patient follow 30 day follow every three month survival disease status . Clinical Study Endpoints The Primary objective study evaluate safety efficacy pacritinib combine decitabine cytarabine newly diagnose old ( ≥65 year old ) patient AML . The primary endpoint study complete remission accord IWG criterion . The following secondary endpoint evaluate : - Overall Survival ( OS ) - Overall remission ( OS ) rate , define CR + CRp + Cri + PR base IWG response criterion - Relapse-free Survival ( RFS ) - Event-free Survival ( EFS ) - Time Complete Response ( TTCR ) - Remission Duration DISCUSSION OF STUDY DESIGN Prognosis old patient AML poor , median survival 9-12 month . Older patient often candidate intensive chemotherapy allogeneic stem cell transplantation . Decitabine low-dose cytarabine frequently use upfront treatment old AML patient , however CR rate 40-50 % decitabine 18 % cytarabine . Pacritinib potent tyrosine kinase inhibitor FLT3 JAK3 tyrosine kinase . The objective propose clinical trial evaluate efficacy , safety , feasibility pacritinib combine decitabine cytarabine newly diagnose old AML patient . The primary endpoint increase complete remission .</detailed_description>
