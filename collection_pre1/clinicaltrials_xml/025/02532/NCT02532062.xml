	<brief_title>The Pittsburgh Vitamin D Study : Vitamin D Supplementation Vitamin D-deficient Subjects Risk Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Smoking avoidance cessation essential prevention lung cancer . However , smoker able quit smoking , importantly , former smoker remain increased risk lung cancer compare never smoker . Despite smoke prevention/cessation program treatment advance , lung cancer still lead cause cancer-related mortality United States 158,000 individual expect die disease 2015 . Effective safe prevention strategy expect successful reduce lung cancer death treatment establish disease . NF-kappaB ( NF-kB ) pathway activation underlie smoking-related inflammation lung carcinogenesis , agent suppress NF-κB signaling may potential prevent lung cancer . Recent preclinical data group others indicate active metabolite vitamin D3 , 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [ 1,25 ( OH ) 2D3 ] , lung cancer chemopreventive activity . Because systemic 1,25 ( OH ) 2D3 administration complicate hypercalcemia-inducing property , investigator propose use oral supplementation vitamin D3 ( cholecalciferol ) safely achieve chemopreventive 1,25 ( OH ) 2D3 level within lung . This randomized , placebo-controlled Phase IIb study aim evaluate ability 4,000 IU oral vitamin D3/day ( combination daily multivitamin ) safely convert vitamin D3-deficient subject risk lung cancer vitamin D3-sufficient state . Study participant recruit among Pittsburgh Lung Screening Study Extension ( PLuSS-X ) PLuSS-XX participant diagnose lung cancer , among patient population see PI protocol . The study consist two stage , screen intervention stage , consent form . In Stage 1 ( screen stage ) , vitamin D3 status subject potentially eligible participation intervention determine ; Stage 2 ( intervention stage ) , supplementation oral vitamin D3 evaluate . Participants fulfill eligibility criterion provide signed consent Stage 2 randomize 2:1 ratio receive : ( A ) 4,000 IU vitamin D3 plus multivitamin ( contain 400 IU vitamin D3 ) daily one year , ( B ) placebo vitamin D3 pill plus multivitamin daily one year . Both group contain equal number current ex-smokers ; total 120 subject randomize . To evaluate whether supplementation safely correct vitamin D3 deficiency population , blood sample obtain baseline , 3 , 6 , 12 month intervention evaluation 25 ( OH ) D3 serum calcium . The collected blood also use facilitate biomarker assessment . Pulmonary function test ( PFTs ) obtain baseline repeat 12 month determine whether supplementation effect lung function . Sputum nasal epithelium collect baseline , 6 month 12 month facilitate biomarker assessment . - Study Objectives Primary Objective : To establish 12-month conversion rate ( i.e. , proportion subject whose baseline vitamin D3 deficiency correct 12 month supplementation ) . Secondary Objectives : To determine 3-month 6-month conversion rate examine effect vitamin D3 supplementation current former smoker . Additionally , examine effect vitamin D3 supplementation biomarkers lung cancer risk , inflammation , pulmonary function .</detailed_description>
