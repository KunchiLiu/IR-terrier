	<brief_summary>Early cancer rectum remove safely anus without subject patient major abdominal surgery procedure call TEMS ( transanal endoscopic microsurgery ) . Patients undergo TEMS benefit reduce mortality , impotence , hospital stay avoid stoma may associate pelvic surgery . Currently patient eligible TEMS offer variety reason include uncertainty risk leave residual tumour increase risk subsequent recurrence cancer within pelvis . Current UK guideline state role image assess malignant polyp . Conversely whilst retrospectively review MRI databank investigator find evidence MRI accurately judge depth early tumour thereby potentially identify patient local excision . The investigator hope prospectively test hypothesis MRI scan accurately gauge depth tumour spread unselected group benign malignant tumour measure 20mm 50mm size . The investigator identify eligible patient await surgery / polypectomy consent pilot study participant undergo MRI assess tumour ass safety level rectal wall . The accuracy MRI establish reference gold standard histopathology . Should MRI prove sensitive specific investigator hope change national guideline mandate MRI standardise assessment thereby increase appropriate use TEMS UK .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Data publish NBOCAP 2014 show 45 % 9,433 rectal cancer treat UK annually either T1 T2 66 % node negative . Despite 77 % operate underwent major resection whilst 11 % locally excise . Rectal tumours heterogenous endosocpic biopsy unreliable way exclude malignancy . Objective endoscopic criterion apply assess lesion morphology pit pattern mostly evidence base derive international single centre trial accuracy variable use UK routine practice remain un-audited . Endorectal ultrasound rarely use routine practice show inaccurate . Of early rectal cancer submit UK TEM database , 44 % pT1 31 % pT2 cancer incorrectly presume benign preoperatively . Pre operatively consider lesion benign fact malignant associate hazard 1.98 leave residual disease excision TEMS . High-Spatial-Resolution magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) standard care assess circumferential resection margin rectal tumour triaging patient advanced tumour neoadjuvant therapy reduce local recurrence . MRI establish modality identify rectal cancer position , relationship tumour peritoneal reflection , less user dependent ultrasound , provide reliable information extramural disease available centre operate rectal cancer . There paucity evidence base clarify current accuracy MRI assess T stage lymph node involvement early rectal cancer . Eligible patient identify colonoscopy find 20mm 50mm rectal tumour within 150mm anal verge . Endoscopic assessment +/- ultrasound +/- biopsy may take per local policy review local multidisciplinary team meeting . Patients invited participate trial index colonoscopy . Patients fully recover endoscopy sedation give approach join trial . All patient enter trial sent MRI . The MRI report use novel stag proforma . The result stag investigation , MRI biopsy make available clinician MDT discussion . The patient proceed excision resection tumour per clinician / MDT discussion . Patients follow per routine NHS care determine local polyp surveillance protocol MDT discussion .</detailed_description>
