	<detailed_description>Sleep highly dynamic process large part sleep level arousal fluctuate multi-second time scale sleep stage specific background transient , phasic event clearly arise background constitute microstructure sleep . This microstructure part dynamic physiological sleep regulation time reflect instability sleep , critically involved pathophysiology sleep determinant recuperative value sleep daytime performance . Intriguingly , sleep microstructural fluctuation multi-second range corresponds closely so-called infra-slow oscillation ubiquitous central nervous system . Infra-slow oscillation ( 0.01 - 0.1 Hz ) observe human animal across brain structure spatial scale dynamic single unit fire rate , direct electrical potential fluctuation oscillation amplitude modulation . The possibility record infra-slow oscillation level surface EEG direct current ( DC ) Full band ( Fb ) EEG offer new approach study microstructure sleep characterise full range sleep-related EEG oscillation . The objective study : 1. record systematically characterise infra-slow oscillation wake stage sleep 2. explore relationship sleep infra-slow oscillation microstructural event sleep , particular cyclic alternate pattern 3. explore effect acute sleep deprivation sleep infra-slow EEG activity 4. investigate infra-slow sleep EEG activity patient RLS/PLMS , common sleep disorder prominent periodic arousal , heart rate activation , leg movement 5. explore relationship infra-slow EEG oscillation periodic event movement autonomic system activity patient RLS/PLMS .</detailed_description>
