	<brief_title>Mobile Monitoring Fracture Healing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients receive external fixators tibial fracture defect recruit . Normal struts device substitute similar instrument strut enable force measurement . During clinical visit , force fixator , plus foot force , measure ambulation . Changes force measurement across treatment bone heal analyze . Severe fracture low limb associate high energy trauma civilian military patient , sometimes treated external fixation device stabilize bone healing occur . The device keep patient year significant cost , intrusiveness , risk infection . The clinician must decide remove device adequate healing occur bone re-fracture , heal rate variable x-rays misleading . The clinician must also identify patient start progress poorly early revision surgery need prevent complication . The investigator ' goal develop novel approach instrument collect mechanical data orthopaedic brace device , identify new methodology interpret large volume functional data optimize personalized treatment . The present study focus external fixators . Strain gauge adhere fixators fixator force measure clinical visit . In pilot study investigator develop method predict heal base measured force .</detailed_description>
