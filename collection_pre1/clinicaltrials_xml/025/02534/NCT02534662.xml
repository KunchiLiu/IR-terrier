	<brief_summary>Objectives : Study evaluate safety feasibility endoluminal vertical gastroplasty ( EVG ) use endoluminal-suturing device . Briefly , Vertical gastric plication novel surgical approach reduce stomach capacity . Anterior surface plication great curvature plication variation vertical gastric plication reduce gastric capacity infolding anterior surface great curvature stomach , respectively . These approach test , positive result . A transoral endoluminal approach ( ie , procedure require incision , access grant mouth ) offer potential additional benefit patient , procedure continue become minimally invasive . Advances endoluminal device allow clinician ability begin explore bariatric procedure perform via flexible endoscopy . Although procedure may effective surgical counterpart , less-invasive option may relieve patient significant risk associate surgery . Study duration number subject A period approximately 6 month anticipate form time time first patient enrol completion last patient . The participant follow follow : Day ( 0 ) : Procedure Day ( +1 ) : Clinical Follow discharge ( i.e . adverse effect observe ) 1 month : Follow endoscopy , Clinical assessment 3 month : Follow endoscopy , Clinical assessment 6 month : Final assessment ( Endoscopically Clinical ) On Parallel nutritional specialist monitor patient quarterly basis ( 1,3,6,12 ) . Study procedures The intervention perform general anesthesia tracheal intubation . Endomina introduce stomach guide wire fix endoscope . The procedure include placement 4-6 transmural anterior-posterior suture argon plasma coagulation tissue opposition area order ensure persistence pouch reduction . Patient keep overnight procedure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Surgery effective treatment morbid obesity divide restrictive surgery ( Lap Band Sleeve gastrectomy ) , malabsorptive surgery ( Biliary pancreatic deviation duodenal switch ) combination ( RYGBP ) . This late technique common effective surgical procedure perform worldwide process effective treatment morbid obesity complication , achieve excess weight loss 65 80 % ; 1-2 year surgery.1 Vertical gastric plication novel surgical approach reduce stomach capacity . Anterior surface plication great curvature plication variation vertical gastric plication reduce gastric capacity infolding anterior surface great curvature stomach , respectively . These approach test , positive result . 3 A transoral endoluminal approach ( ie , procedure require incision , access grant mouth ) offer potential additional benefit patient , procedure continue become minimally invasive . Advances endoluminal device allow clinician ability begin explore bariatric procedure perform via flexible endoscopy . Although procedure may effective surgical counterpart , less-invasive option may relieve patient significant risk associate surgery . 4 Endomina ( Endo Tools Therapeutics , Nivelles , Belgium ) CE mark robot drive device may attach endoscope inside body allow remote manipulation arm device peroral intervention . It offer possibility make transoral surgical full thickness suture may allow performing , via transoral route . Study design Prospective , non-randomized , open-label , single-center safety feasibility study Objectives : Study evaluate safety feasibility endoluminal vertical gastroplasty ( EVG ) use endoluminal-suturing device .</detailed_description>
