	<brief_title>Head Head Comparison Two Needles EUS Guided FNB</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>EUS guide core biopsy use various needle design size , seem promise technique procure tissue solid pancreatic mass make accurate histological diagnosis . EUS-guided core biopsy pancreas may aid patient non-diagnostic EUS-FNA sample institution on-site cytopathology available prompt evaluation tissue adequacy . Making accurate diagnosis assist plan appropriate treatment also may decrease morbidity/mortality unnecessary surgery . Our goal evaluate compare diagnostic accuracy specimen adequacy Cook Medical 25 gauge ProCore ultrasound biopsy needle Medtronic ( Beacon ) 25 gauge SharkCore ultrasound biopsy needle . We hypothesize endoscopic ultrasound tissue biopsy different diagnostic accuracy solid pancreatic lesion use 25 gauge SharkCore ultrasound biopsy needle comparison 25 gauge ProCore ultrasound biopsy needle . This non- inferior pair , prospective , single-blind study design patient undergoing EUS solid pancreatic mass . Two biopsy two endoscopic needle interest study use random order . The biopsy needle pass first randomize , two needle alternate remain biopsy . Randomization occur permute block 3 . Physician record ease/ difficulty obtain 4 biopsy scale 1 5 . Also , record needle visibility ultrasound . The biopsy site examine evidence bleeding . Biopsies send pathology laboratory blind fashion cod container , pathologist determine number adequate biopsy two pass needle.The pathologist also provide scale perceive diagnostic usefulness material blind fashion . Post procedure care include letter refer physician recommendation treatment follow . This study include 30 patient refer Hershey Medical Center .</detailed_description>
