	<brief_summary>This trial Phase I open-label safety study Prolanta™ , recombinant analog human prolactin protein single amino acid substitution create antagonist prolactin receptor . The Sponsor believe block prolactin receptor patient ovarian cancer effective monotherapy combination chemotherapy . This Phase I study conducted Subjects recurrent persistent epithelial ovarian cancer , primary peritoneal cancer , fallopian tube cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Prolanta™ Recurrent Persistent Epithelial Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study first-in-human study design establish preliminary human safety , tolerability pharmacokinetic parameter Prolanta monotherapy patient recurrent persistent ovarian cancer , primary peritoneal cancer , fallopian tube cancer . In addition , biomarkers related activity human prolactin examine tumor sample obtain prior treatment end study treatment determine pharmacodynamics dose level Prolanta administer . Three dose level evaluate , dose dose-limiting toxicity observe recommended Phase II dose . Because antagonist effect expect low toxicity , Sponsor believe Prolanta may administer continuously monotherapy conjunction periodic administration chemotherapy ( i.e. , dual therapy ) . The dosing schedule use trial design evaluate , increment , safety tolerability Prolanta 90 day cycle . Subjects assess antibody presence throughout study , initially weekly basis bi-weekly . Subjects initially dose 28 day follow safety assessment period , continue additional 56 day toxicity observe . The primary objective study determine safety tolerability Prolanta woman recurrent ovarian cancer determine optimal dose Prolanta use Phase II study . The safety evaluation determine assess treatment-emergent adverse event , physical examination , ECG , change clinical laboratory result include clinical chemistry , hematology urinalysis , change pituitary hormone level , vital sign include blood pressure , pulse respiratory rate . The optimal dose Prolanta determine evaluate safety profile blood level Prolanta . If possible , effect Prolanta dose tumor biomarkers tumor burden also use determine optimally bioactive Phase II dose level . The secondary objective study ( ) determine pharmacokinetic parameter Prolanta include Cmax , Tmax , half-life area curve ( AUC ) ; ( ii ) determine effect treatment Prolanta tumor marker ; ( iii ) determine clinical efficacy Prolanta Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) , version 1.1</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects must recurrent persistent epithelial ovarian cancer , primary peritoneal cancer fallopian tube cancer . Histologic confirmation original primary tumor require . Subjects shall cytoreductive ( debulking ) surgery . Formalinfixed , paraffinembedded tumor tissue block must available Subject upon enrollment provide Sponsor within 7 day Day 1 . Subjects must measurable accessible disease . Subjects must either : ( ) relapse within 6 month ( progress ) last platinum regimen ( may primary/ adjuvant regimen ) ; ( ii ) progress 2 prior platinum regimen ( regardless duration since recent platinum regimen ) ; ( iii ) tolerate platinum therapy due hypersensitivity allergic reaction . In addition first platinumbased chemotherapy , Subjects allow previously receive two additional cytotoxic regimens management recurrent persistent disease . `` Cytotoxic regimen '' include agent target genetic and/or mitotic apparatus divide cell , result doselimiting toxicity bone marrow and/or gastrointestinal mucosa . Resolution effect prior therapy ( except alopecia ) NCI CTCAE v4.03 grade ≤2 baseline laboratory value define inclusion criterion # 14 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status : 0 2 Life expectancy &gt; 12 week Any hormonal therapy direct malignant tumor must discontinue least one week prior registration . Continuation hormone replacement therapy permit . Any prior therapy direct malignant tumor , include immunologic agent chemotherapy , must discontinue least four week prior registration ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) . Patients must normal organ marrow function define . Normal electrocardiogram ( ECG ) correct QT interval ( QTc ) ≤470 msec . Currently receive investigational agent participate investigational therapy trial within 30 day . Planned pregnancy , currently pregnant breastfeeding . Females childbearing potential use medically accept mean contraception ( e.g. , intrauterine device , oral contraceptive , implant , DepoProvera® , barrier device spermicide ) engage sexual intercourse . History evidence upon physical examination central nervous system ( CNS ) disease , include primary brain tumor , seizures control standard medical therapy , brain metastasis history cerebrovascular accident , transient ischemic attack subarachnoid hemorrhage within 6 month registration study . Serious preexist medical condition severe heart disease uncontrolled : infection , hypertension , hypercalcemia , diabetes , psychogenic disorder . Have concurrent malignancy , except adequately treat situ carcinoma cervix basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin . ( Subjects undergone potentially curative therapy prior malignancy eligible provide evidence disease ≥ 5 year patient deem low risk recurrence . ) Any significant medical condition , opinion Investigator , would significantly decrease study compliance , jeopardize safety patient , affect validity trial result .</criteria>
