	<brief_summary>Background : Many people around world get tuberculosis ( TB ) non-tuberculous mycobacteria ( NTM ) infection . Sometimes medicine treat infection get bacteria lung . Researchers want find way tell enough medicine get need lung . They look much medicine sputum ( cough ) compare much blood . They also investigate new test quickly figure medicine likely treat TB effectively . Objective : To determine relationship concentration TB drug plasma sputum time . Eligibility : People age 18 old TB NTM infection suspect drug resistant . They must take TB NTM medicine . Design : Participants screen medical history . Participants study 2 8 day . Participants give 3 sputum sample least 2 different day . They cough sputum cup . Participants blood drawn 4 time day 2 different day .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study support two avenue research , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) drug use treat tuberculosis resistance drug develop pathogen . Given high inter-individual variability TB drug exposure , therapeutic drug monitoring would value adjust drug dose TB patient order improve clinical outcome minimize toxicity . It practice setting reason associate cost also blood collection invasive procedure . Sputum hand often produce spontaneously discard waste . Drug level measure sputum plasma . Here test hypothesis sputum drug level predictive drug concentration plasma and/or specific lesion compartment caseum open cavity . We also characterize exposure standard 1st 2nd line TB drug one sit infection , since sputum direct contact cavity caseum . The subject contribute three sputum sample spontaneously produce least two day four blood sample follow drug administration two different day ( 8 blood sample total ) . The data analyze use population PK modeling approach generate concentration-time profile 24-hour area curve ( AUC ) study drug sputum . Correlations value , plasma lesion AUCs examine . We draw recently complete TB lesion pharmacokinetic study ( www.ClinicalTrials.gov # NCT00816426 ) seek correlation drug exposure sputum pulmonary lesion . In addition drug concentration , sputum culture standard method isolate Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb ) , determine drug resistance profile , save test second generation Xpert TB XDR assay .</detailed_description>
