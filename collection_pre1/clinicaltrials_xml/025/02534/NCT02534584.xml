	<brief_summary>This study service evaluation assess impact compliance Acute Kidney Injury care bundle ( AKI-CB ) clinical renal outcome . The AKI care bundle couple interruptive electronic alert , trigger first attempt order blood test medication patient identify AKI electronic recognition serum creatinine result . The interruptive alert warn clinician AKI request complete AKI care bundle . Once AKI care bundle complete , clinician able request blood test medication . The clinician able override alert state reason . Education respect importance AKI AKI-CB provide every four month junior doctor rotate different speciality also clinical governance day . The investigator compare AKI episode , AKI-CB complete early ( define within 24 hour availability blood result ) either AKI-CB complete late ( defined 24 hour availability blood result ) complete . The AKI patient either AKI-CB complete late complete consider AKI-CB complete analysis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This single centre study conduct Royal Derby Hospital , 1139-bed tertiary care centre . Data collect February 2013 December 2013 adult patient age 18 year . An electronic recognition system AKI use since 2010 allows prospective data collection case AKI . The electronic recognition system modify December 2012 , incorporate Kidney Diseases Improving Global Outcomes ( KDIGO ) definition AKI . In effort improve clinical outcome , intranet guideline introduce along electronic recognition alert system . In December 2012 , one-page paper version AKI CB devise , subsequently incorporate hospital electronic patient record 1st February 2013 . During period , education AKI CB give staff acute area hospital poster explain AKI CB display clinical area . The hospital already electronic order investigation prescribe medication place . The CB consist simple standardized investigation intervention , remind clinician importance thorough Assessment , Urinalysis , establish Diagnosis , plan Investigations Treatment time issue guidance Seeking advice nephrologist care patient AKI ( AUDITS ) . All step CB objective clinician request click yes step CB . On 1st August 2013 , AKI CB couple interruptive electronic alert , trigger first attempt order blood test medication patient identify AKI . The interruptive alert would warn clinician AKI request complete AKI CB . Once AKI CB complete , clinician able request blood test medication . The clinician would able override alert state reason . The location patient categorize follow division - Medical Assessment Unit , Medical ward , Surgical &amp; Orthopedic ward , Haematology Oncology ward , Intensive Care Surgical Step Down ( high dependency unit ) Other ward . A weekly report automatically generate capture patient location hospital , age , date admission , date discharge , finish consultant episode survival status reporting date . For study , investigator analyze AKI episode , AKI CB complete early ( define within 24 hour availability blood result ) either AKI CB complete late ( defined 24 hour availability blood result ) complete . The AKI episodes either AKI CB complete late complete consider AKI CB complete analysis . Community acquire AKI define AKI within 24 hour admission . Survival status patient obtain February 2015 .</detailed_description>
