	<brief_summary>In study , prednisone dose , day/time administration control stable COPD patient population determine effect peripheral whole blood gene expression . This data never collect COPD population use investigator ' choose platform gene expression ( Affymetrix Human Gene 1.1 ST ) . Conducting experiment essential achieve broad aim already exist relate study title `` Clinical Implementation Outcomes Evaluation Blood-Based Biomarkers COPD Management '' study . As part exist study , blood collect hospitalized non-hospitalized COPD patient order develop blood-based biomarker test diagnosis prediction acute exacerbation COPD ( AECOPD ) . The majority patient administer prednisone part standard care treatment AECOPD . As , effect prednisone gene expression need rule .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The course COPD frequently complicate period exacerbation ( worsen symptom ) related infection , pollution , diseases poor management disease . These period result urgent visit physician office emergency room account lead cause hospitalization . In term patient care , physicians lack objective measurement accurately risk-stratify patient monitor effectiveness intervention provide patient . Regrettably , blood test predict get AECOPD require hospitalization . Additionally , current therapy COPD modestly effective reduce exacerbation . A major challenge COPD drug development patient care lack marker , surrogate otherwise , use predict outcome hospitalization mortality . These critical barrier drug development improve patient care could address development clinical implementation diagnostic predictive AECOPD biomarkers . This aim already exist relate study title `` Clinical Implementation Outcomes Evaluation Blood-Based Biomarkers COPD Management study '' . This study enrol COPD patient since July 2012 . The majority study patient prednisone time blood collection enrollment . The analysis publicly available datasets make abundantly clear prednisone important wide-ranging effect peripheral whole blood gene expression . These data insufficient , however , inform disease specific effect gene expression . In addition , study carry use different gene expression platform , used estimate probeset-specific prednisone effect . Therefore , investigator need ensure gene expression associate AECOPD fact result drug effect . Conducting study help u answer question .</detailed_description>
