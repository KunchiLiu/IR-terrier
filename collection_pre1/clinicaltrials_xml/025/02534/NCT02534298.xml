	<brief_title>Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study Central Auditory System After Single Sided Deafness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Single side deafness ( SSD ) asymmetrical hearing loss common hearing impairment , social consequence well establish . At central auditory system level , single side deafness associate reorganization auditory temporal cortex lead reduction inter hemispheric asymmetry . Purpose : Our main objective study relation reorganization central auditory system , namely inter hemispheric asymmetry , psychophysical deficit binaural hearing subject SSD . Abstract : Binaural hearing enable spatial localization sound source improve speech recognition compete noise . SSD asymmetrical hearing loss common hearing impairment , affect 0.3 1/1000 child . In adult population , prevalence increase age . The impact SSD asymmetrical hearing loss quality life index well establish report underline consequence child scholarship . Previous neuro-imaging electro physiological study highlight reduction normal inter hemispheric asymmetry subject SSD . To best knowledge , report relation central auditory system reorganization behavioural deficit . The investigator propose conduct study analyze relationship reduction inter hemispheric asymmetry performance binaural hearing test . Thus , auditory plasticity study use functional magnetic resonance image specifically BOLD variation auditory temporal cortex . A set binaural hearing assessment perform , include speech recognition noise localization ability . The correlation lateralization ratio binaural measurement ( speech reception threshold ( SRT ) dichotic hearing , diotic hearing , reverse dichotic hearing ) estimate . Likewise , impact SSD duration cortical reorganization binaural test study .</detailed_description>
