	<brief_summary>There evidence human study well animal study treatment low cholesterol reduce risk die prostate cancer.To decide cholesterol-lowering therapy slow growth prostate cancer , investigator would like low cholesterol prior surgery measure growth prostate cancer cell prostate remove . The investigator use combination two drug approve U.S. Food Drug Administration low cholesterol . The drug combination commercially available doctor 's prescription sell Vytorin® . It known maximal cholesterol-lower effect see 2 week treatment Vytorin® . Therefore , study patient receive least 2 week , 6 week Vytorin® prior surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE Prostate cancer commonly diagnose cancer second lead cause cancer death among men North America . In US , 200,000 newly diagnose case nearly 40,000 death prostate cancer ( CaP ) annually . Although elevated lipid level understood increase risk coronary heart disease , importance CaP understood . Epidemiologic study consistently show association lipid lower intervention decrease risk advance CaP . There report prospective study lipid-lowering intervention direct CaP . Epidemiologic study preclinical observation suggest intervention low cholesterol decrease risk develop lethal CaP . However , definitive , phase III study cholesterol-lowering effect advance CaP development need prior clinical implementation intervention . Such trial require massive commitment resource large number patient need long follow-up . A rational intermediate step conduct presurgical intervention study lower cholesterol men undergo radical prostatectomy . Molecular evidence treatment effect provide sound rationale definitive clinical trial , may provide predictive biomarkers validate future trial . The investigator propose prospective trial ass effect human prostate maximal cholesterol lower strategy use dual agent men already schedule undergo radical prostatectomy prostate cancer . Simvastatin cholesterol-lowering drug approve FDA 1991 commercially available Zocor ( Merck ) generic agent . After ingestion , convert inactive lactone correspond β-hydroxyacid , inhibit HMG-CoA reductase conversion HMG-CoA mevalonate . Ezetimibe cholesterol-lowering agent operate distinct mechanism HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor . It FDA approve 2002 commonly administer alone combination statin . It specifically inhibit cholesterol transporter small intestine selectively inhibit absorption cholesterol related sterol . A single pill combine simvastatin ezetimibe available Merck ( Vytorin ) . This commercially available agent standard dose use trial . This study use combination simvastatin ezetimibe achieve maximal cholesterol lower prior prostatectomy .</detailed_description>
