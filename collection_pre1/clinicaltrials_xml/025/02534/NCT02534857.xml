	<brief_title>A Study Comparing Shorter Exposure Oocyte Spermatozoa Versus Standard Incubation Live Birth Rate In-vitro Fertilization Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Background In vitro fertilization ( IVF ) technique commonly use treatment infertile couple . To obtain good outcome IVF , important enhance embryo quality optimize IVF technique . In IVF procedure , oocytes sperm routinely co-incubated overnight , may expose oocyte zygotes suboptimal culture condition increase reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) produce sperm long term culture [ 1 ] . High level reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) adversely affect quality embryo , result harden zona pellucida impair implantation capacity embryos [ 2-4 ] . Studies show successful fertilization mamamal oocyte occur 20mins gamete meet [ 5 ] . Sperm penetrate cumulus cell within 15min , 80 % oocyte fertilize exposed large number spermatozoon within 1hrs [ 1 ] . As attempt avoid possible detrimental effect oocytes long exposure sperm , brief co-incubation insemination protocol develop . It imply long-term co-incubation oocyte sperm may necessary may even harmful . Some report suggest sperm-oocyte exposure time 1-6 h improve IVF outcome [ 1,2,6,7 ] However , study report advantage short insemination time [ 8,9,10 ] . Recent publish Meta analysis show [ 11 ] brief co-incubation gamete associate significantly high rate clinical pregnancy ( RR : 1.84 , 95 % CI : 1.24-2.73 ) , ongoing pregnancy ( RR : 1.73 , 95 % CI : 1.27-2.33 ) high rate implantation ( RR : 1.80 , 95 % CI : 1.43-2.26 ) standard insemination . But rate normal fertilization ( RR : 0.98 , 95 % CI : 0.93-1.02 ) , good quality embryo ( RR : 1.24 , 95 % CI : 1.0-1.53 ) polyspermy ( RR : 0.84 , 95 % CI : 0.7-1.01 ) significantly different compare standard insemination . In another Cochrane meta-analysis [ 12 ] eight RCTs 733 woman include , get similar result . But report clinical pregnancy rate , ongoing pregnancy rate significantly high brief co-incubation group standard insemination . For miscarriage rate , six miscarriage one trial include 167 woman . This low quality evidence suggest significant difference odds miscarriage brief co-incubation standard insemination ( OR 1.98 , 95 % CI 0.35 11.09 ; P = 0.44 ) . And live birth report included study , unclear whether brief co-incubation improve life birth rate compare standard overnight insemination protocol . Drawbacks inherent quality study , lack allocation concealment blinding , limit quality available evidence . To good evaluate issue , well design RCTs require assess whether brief co-incubation would contribute high live birth rate low miscarriage rate compare standard overnight insemination protocol . 2 . Objectives : The objective present randomize , double blind control study compare clinical effectiveness ( especially live birth rate ) shorter exposure oocyte spermatozoon compare standard incubation woman undergo IVF treatment . 3 . Trial design : A total 280 infertile woman undergo IVF treatment randomize one follow two group computer-generated random number place sealed envelope : Shorter exposure oocyte spermatozoon group : oocyte expose spermatozoa 2 hour Standard incubation group : oocyte expose spermatozoa 20 hour Treatment subject All technique IVF include ovarian stimulation accord local protocol . 4.1 Ovarian stimulation IVF All woman start IVF treatment ovarian stimulation use either long agonist antagonist protocol . For long protocol , gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue ( GnRHa ) give pituitary desensitization , Day 2-3 menstrual cycle , undergo transvaginal ultrasound examination serum E2 measurement . Human menopausal gonadotrophin ( hMG ) recombinant FSH start 150-300 IU per day base antral follicle count , age woman previous ovarian response , accord standard operation procedure centre . Ovarian response monitor serial transvaginal scanning without hormonal monitoring . Further dosage adjustment base ovarian response discretion clinician charge . For antagonist protocol , antagonist ( cetritide0.25mg daily ) give 6th day ovarian stimulation day hcg prim . When three lead follicle â‰¥18 mm , hCG 10 000 IU ovidrel 250 mg give trigger final maturation oocyte . Oocyte retrieval arrange around 36 h later . 4.2 Insemination Procedures All semen sample prepare conventional swim-up procedure . At2hr oocyte retrieval , mature oocyte inseminated approximately 50,000-100,000 motile spermatozoon . 4.3 . Assignment mask On day OPU , patient randomize occyte pick laboratory technician accord computer generate randomization list seal envelope short incubation group control group . Until completion whole study , patient clinician blind group assign . Control arm Women allocate control arm , oocyte expose spermatozoa 20 hour , checked fertilization day 1 ( 20 hour ) denude Intervention arm For allocate intervention arm , oocyte expose spermatozoa 2 hour gently wash two organ dish contain 1.5 ml equilibrate medium , transfer corresponding microdroplet equilibrate fresh medium . Surrounding cumulus cell retain , remove ooctyes . 4.4 Fertilization Embryo Evaluation Both group oocytes decoronated checked presence two pronucleus two polar body confirm fertilization . All outcome ( i.e. , fertilization , one pronucleus , polyspermia , degeneration ) also record . Embryo morphology assess every day culture . Embryos score accord follow criterion . Briefly , embryos classify : gradeA , cellular fragmentation ; grade B , &lt; 20 % fragmentation ; grade C , 20 % 50 % fragmentation ; grade D , &gt; 50 % fragmentation . The number blastomeres per embryo also record . Grade A B embryo constitute `` good quality embryo '' . The transfer perform team clinician maximum 2 embryo replace accord standard protocol transabdominal ultrasound guidance . Luteal phase support give discretion physician . 4.5 Follow strategy : A pregnancy test carry 2 week embryo transfer arm . All woman positive pregnancy test 2 week fresh embryo transfer undergo transvaginal ultrasound scan 5 week identify presence gestation sac fetal heart signify ongoing pregnancy . Data pregnancy outcome include early pregnancy loss miscarriage ectopic pregnancy collect . In order achieve consistency respect collection outcome , standardise case report form ( CRF ) complete woman centre . These CRFs include detail treatment receive , pregnancy outcome , complication pregnancy , mode delivery birth outcome . Statistics 5.1 Analysis plan : Demographic factor clinical characteristic collect part baseline data collection summarise count ( percentage ) categorical variable , mean ( standard deviation [ SD ] ) normally distribute continuous variable , median ( interquartile [ IQR ] entire range ) continuous variable . Outcomes participant analyse group assign regardless deviation protocol treatment receive ( intention-to-treat ) . Comparative statistical analysis entail calculate relative risk ( RR ) ( 95 % CI ) primary outcome ( 99 % CIs dichotomous secondary outcome ) , mean difference ( 99 % CI ) normally distribute continuous secondary outcome , median difference ( 99 % CI ) skew continuous variable . All analyse adjust minimisation factor account correlation treatment group introduce balance randomisation ( force outcomes treatment arm similar apart treatment effect ) . Adjusted risk ratio estimate use log binomial regression model , use log Poisson regression model robust variance estimator binomial model fail converge . Linear regression use normally distribute outcomes quantile regression skew continuous variable . Pre-specified subgroup analysis include Cleavage versus blastocyst stage transfer . 6 . Sample size estimation : The average live birth rate center 2010-2012 30 % per transfer . According recent publish Meta analysis [ 11 ] , brief co-incubation gamete associate significantly high rate ongoing pregnancy ( RR : 1.73 , 95 % CI : 1.27-2.33 ) standard insemination . Assuming live birth treatment group =50 % ( increase 70 % ) ; 90 % power two-sided 5 % level statistical significance , need recruit 124 woman arm . To account 10 % loss follow , recruit 140 subject group 280 subject whole study . 7 . Assessment safety Recults recent publish Meta analysis [ 11,12 ] show rate normal fertilization , good quality embryos polyspermy significantly different short time incubation gamete compare standard insemination . Thus , major safety concern study . 8 . Direct access source data / document : Trial-related monitoring , audit , IRB review regulatory inspection allow . 9 . Quality control quality assurance Patients manage list investigator adequate experience managing assist reproduction treatment . A Trial steering committee form oversee conduct trial . 10 .
