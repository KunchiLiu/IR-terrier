	<brief_summary>Ventilation-associated pneumonia main site healthcare-associated infection severe trauma patient , mean incidence rate 35 % . Ventilator-associated pneumonia increase morbi-mortality , length stay intensive care overall management cost . As recalled jury 2008 SFAR-SRLF consensus conference prevention nosocomial infection contract intensive care , success preventive endeavour depend number measure : orotracheal intubation route , maintain tube cuff pressure 25 30 cm H2O , maintain semi-seated position ≥30° , nasal oropharyngeal care regular interval , strive avoid unscheduled extubation , use write sedation-analgesia algorithm allow early weaning ventilation . Devices ensure continuous pneumatic control tube cuff pressure efficient maintain tracheal balloon pressure intermittent adjustment use hand-held manometer . In one study , device clearly facilitate diminution microaspiration gastric content ventilator-associated pneumonia incidence density ( 9.7 vs. 22 VAP/1000 day mechanical ventilation ; p = 0.005 ) . The investigator put forward hypothesis adjoin device provide continuous pneumatic regulation tube cuff pressure overall strategy aim ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention ( include semi-recumbent position ≥30° , oro-nasal-pharyngeal care regular interval reduce risk exposure ) decrease VAP incidence 50 % severely traumatised patient whose condition necessitate mechanical ventilation expect duration exceed 48h . Ours first large-scale study evaluate interest innovative technology bundle decrease ventilator-associated pneumonia incidence one intensive care population risk , namely severe trauma patient , population presently benefit recommend preventive measure .</brief_summary>
