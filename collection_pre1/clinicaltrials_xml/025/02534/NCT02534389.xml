	<brief_summary>Neoadjuvant treatment radiotherapy ( RDT ) chemotherapy ( CT ) treatment choice rectal adenocarcinoma stage II III . This result currently pathologic complete response 10 % 30 % case . The immune inflammatory response alter individual directly relate response therapy . Both disease treatment colorectal cancer impact quality life nutritional status . In study cell animal model incorporation fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) docosahexaenoic ( DHA ) - derive fish oil - show interfere process inflammation , cell signal gene transcription enhance response treatment . Are report ability restore apoptosis tumor cell , sensitization tumor cell chemotherapy , production less pro-inflammatory cytokine preservation normal energy protein metabolism . The aim study verify daily consumption 2.4 g EPA + DHA adult neoadjuvant therapy promote change inflammatory immunological marker host response tumor response alter nutritional status . It expect supplementation reflect control inflammatory immune response favor tumor cell death contribute pathological complete response happen preservation nutritional status . Subjects randomized supplementation . All assess four moment neoadjuvant therapy immediate postoperative . Results present compare intervention group control group moment .</brief_summary>
