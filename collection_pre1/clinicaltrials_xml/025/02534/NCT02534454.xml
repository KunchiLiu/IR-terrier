	<brief_summary>The purpose phase 1 translational pilot study propose gather preliminary data investigate efficacy transcranial direct current stimulation ( TDCS ) cognitive retrain enhance nicotine replacement therapy smoking cessation . The recent use TDCS task relevant region alter behavior hold incredible promise use cognitive retrain intervention protocol . Previous study cognitive retrain focus implicit training technique . This propose study attempt enhance implicit training technique use TDCS implicit retrain order increase learn avoidance-related action tendency towards tobacco . The objective pilot study establish feasibility obtain preliminary data effectiveness use brain stimulation cognitive retraining reduce cigarette smoking individual nicotine addiction .</brief_summary>
