	<detailed_description>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) common preventable treatable disease characterize progressive airflow limitation associate inflammatory response noxious particle gas . Changes anatomy airway lung parenchyma occur result bronchial hypersecretion bronchoalveolar instability cause expiratory flow limitation air trap . This know clinically dynamic hyperinflation . The phenomenon lead increase expiratory reserve volume , residual volume functional residual capacity , also refer end expiratory lung volume . These increase limit tidal volume inspiratory reserve volume eventually affect inspiratory capacity . They alter position rib cause state similar sustain inspiration time , often refer 'inspiratory block ' . This phenomenon responsible characteristic 'barrel chest ' commonly see patient advanced stage COPD . In state position diaphragm flatten shortened reduce ability generate force . Accessory respiratory muscle recruit compensatory adaptation lead shorten over-activation muscle time ( over-adaptation ) . The surround cervicothoracic fascia contract produce postural change anterior projection head , neck hyperextension , increase thoracic kyphosis internal rotation shoulder . These change contribute increase chest tightness , decrease ability generate inspiratory pressure volume increase amount effort require breath . Manual therapy ( MT ) define therapeutic intervention use hand provide treatment musculoskeletal and/or visceral system . It include technique massage , myofascial release , muscle energy technique , ligament balance , joint mobilization joint manipulation . The suggestion MT could deliver long-term benefit people COPD first put forward 2009 . Since number small study report medium term improvement lung function exercise capacity follow repeat application MT intervention . Our aim measure immediate effect lung function single application soft tissue manual therapy patient severe very-severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . We recruitment patient COPD Rehabilitation Program Hospital San Jos√© de Santiago de Chile , assessment : total lung capacity ( TLC ) ; vital capacity ( VC ) ; residual volume ( RV ) ; expiratory reserve volume ( ERV ) ; inspiratory capacity ( IC ) ; airway resistance ( Raw ) . Secondary : heart rate ( HR ) ; respiratory rate ( RR ) ; oxygen saturation ( SpO2 ) .</detailed_description>
