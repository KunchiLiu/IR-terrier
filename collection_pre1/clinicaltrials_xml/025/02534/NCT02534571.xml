A non-inferiority randomized trial propose compare endoscopic use TC-325 mono-therapy current standard ( i.e . hemoclips thermo-coagulation without pre-injection dilute epinephrine ) hemostatic treatment patient acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding non-variceal cause .

	<brief_title>To Compare Hemostatic Powder TC-325 Standard Treatment Control Acute Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding From Nonvariceal Causes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Impact Objectives Long-term impact : Acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding common medical emergency . The majority cause non-variceal etiology mostly peptic ulcer . Endoscopic treatment reduces bleeding , surgery deaths condition . The current endoscopic treatment non-variceal cause includes.the use hemo-clips thermo-coagulation . Endoscopic treatment skill demand challenge difficult access area gastroduodenal tract e.g . posterior bulbar duodenum . Endoscopic application hemostatic powder ( label TC-325 ) technically easy . The propose randomized trial first compare TC-325 standard treatment . An non-inferior treatment hemostatic powder TC-325 would mean wide application endoscopic treatment endoscopists able use . It least used acute control bleed allow time definitive treatment . Objectives : 1 . To compare clinical efficacy hemostatic powder TC-325 standard treatment overall rate hemostasis patient active bleed non-variceal source upper gastrointestinal tract . Investigators aim determine initial rate hemostasis rate bleed initial control group . Investigators would like define role TC-325 mono-therapy compare standard treatment . The rate bleed initial control would also inform u endoscopic application TC-325 follow second look endoscopy target treatment bleed artery . 2 . To compare ease application hemostatic powder TC-325 standard treatment . Background Research , Research Plan Methodology : . Background research Acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding ( AUGIB ) one common medical emergency . Mortality patient AUGIB remain high . In National United Kingdom Audit 2007 , crude overall patient mortality 10 % . Mortality increase patient advanced age significant comorbid illness . Endoscopic therapy greatly improve outcomes patient AUGIB . In pooled analysis randomize controlled trial endoscopic therapy patient nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding , endoscopic therapy significantly reduce bleeding also surgery death . The National United Kingdom audit 2007 find continue delay endoscopy treatment patient admit AUGIB . Only 55 % patient judge belong high risk group underwent endoscopy within 24 hour admission , 74 % high risk lesion offer endoscopic treatment . The gap service provision may organization issue . The lack skills endoscopic therapy may also contribute shortfall . An easy-to-use endoscopic treatment likely help generalize endoscopic hemostasis . The current standard endoscopic therapy consist use hemoclips thermo-coagulation without pre-injection dilute epinephrine . TC-325 proprietary , inert inorganic mineral blend powder approve FDA purpose hemostasis . In United States powder use compression treatment bleed external injury civilian combat casualty . The powder highly absorbent . When contact fluid blood powder rapidly concentrate clot factor bleed site form adherent coagulum . In 2011 , Investigators report first endoscopic human application hemostatic powder TC-325 . In 20 patient Forrest type I bleed gastro-duodenal ulcer , Investigators able control bleed 19 . The single patient refractory bleed angular gastric ulcer underwent angiography leave gastric artery pseudo-aneurysm find arise article . The aneurysm successfully embolized coil angiographic method . None patient need surgery die follow 30 day . These initial result encourage . In gastroduodenal ulcer Forrest I bleed , rate bleeding would around 55 % untreated endoscopy . Subsequent pilot study , several series publish endoscopic use TC-325 . The pooled rate initial control bleed use TC-325 89.6 % . Rate bleed hemostasis 19.2 % . The reported series consist patient different case-mix exclusively non-variceal etiology . Indications use TC-325 also vary series . The powder use mono-therapy , combination endoscopic therapy rescue therapy conventional endoscopic treatment fail . In absence comparative study , role TC-325 remain undefined . Herein Investigators propose randomize control study compare endoscopic use TC-325 mono-therapy current standard hemostasis use either hemo-clips contact thermo-coagulation without diluted epinephrine patient active bleeding ( Forrest type I ) non-variceal upper GI cause . Investigators hypothesize endoscopic application TC-325 would inferior control bleed non-variceal source compare standard treatment . If case , endoscopic use TC-325 may prefer exist technique simplicity TC-325 application . It appeal especially endoscopists less experience endoscopic hemostasis . In lesion challenge anatomical position e.g . posterior bulbar duodenum , TC-325 may prove superior .</detailed_description>
