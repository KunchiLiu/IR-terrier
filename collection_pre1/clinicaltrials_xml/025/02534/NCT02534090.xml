	<brief_summary>Nowadays feed intolerance ( FI ) common condition among preterm infant . It estimate 16 % -29 % premature infant admit neonatal intensive care unit ( NICUs ) develop feed intolerance point length stay . The frequent sign FI presence abdominal distension , abundant and/or bilious gastric residual vomit suggest inability infant tolerate enteral nutrition , increase decrease gestational age ( GA ) birth weight ( BW ) . FI represent one uncontrollable variable early nutritional management infant , may lead suboptimal nutrition , delay attainment full enteral feed prolonged parenteral nutrition supply . NIRS use preterm infant evaluate change cerebral perfusion oxygenation . It provide real time insight oxygen delivery , present regional oxygen saturation rSO2 low value SpO2 distal pulse-oximetry mostly measure arterialized capillary bed ( around 55 % vs 98 % Oxygen saturation regional NIRS v conventional pulse-oximetry ) . Light easily penetrate thin tissue neonate bone soft tissue , particularly thin capillary bed tissue ; NIRS provide non-invasive , continuous information tissue perfusion oxygen dynamic . This technique use principle optical spectrophotometry make use fact biological material , include skull , relatively transparent NIR range . Dave et al . evaluate abdominal tissue oxygenation NIRS , show preterm infant change cerebral - splanchnic oxygenation ratio feeding , mainly increase splanchnic oxygenation . Gay et al . perform abdominal NIRS premature piglet show association perfusion/oxygen change NEC spectrum . The investigator would like evaluate association feed intolerance unchanged splanchnic regional saturation variation cerebral splanchnic ratio . Innovation : FI diagnosis follow subjective approach , clinician worry risk develop Necrotizing enterocolitis ( NEC ) . This non-studied relationship ( FI NEC ) low threshold diagnosis FI . Furthermore , infant FI diagnosis commonly subject stop slow progression feeding , increase risk intestinal villus atrophy , increase length parenteral nutrition support , also length stay NICU setting . If NIRS technology help clinician detect true abnormality objectively new monitor assess adequate feed progress decrease failure feed , therefore diminish need parenteral feed complication associate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Feeding Intolerance Premature Infants Using Near Infrared Spectroscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approach Basic study design The study design matched-pair case-control cohort , longitudinal . Study population assembly patient Premature infant 32 36 6/7 week postmenstrual age , feed tolerance least 50ml/kg/day , inpatient Brigham Women 's NICU . Inclusion criterion : - Premature infants 32 36 6/7 week postmenstrual age , feed tolerance least 50ml/kg/day diagnose food intolerance . - Control group compose patient population age range tolerate least 50 ml/Kg/day ( Half minimum full feed daily requirement ) Human milk enteral Formula deliver bolus , 6 8 time per day . - Written inform consent parent ( ) guardian . Exclusion criterion : - Premature infant know condition could affect attachment sensor body area Gastroschisis , Omphalocele , Post surgical intestine resection , peritoneal dialysis , laceration abdomen frontal area head . - Infants diagnose Necrotizing enterocolitis . - Infants current diagnosis Sepsis and/or Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome ( SIRS ) . - Infants severe Intra-Ventricular Hemorrhage ( Intra-cranial Hemorrhage ) . - Infants Hereditary Spherocytosis , total partial ( hypoplasia ) congenital asplenia hypoplasia . Exposures measurement The investigator use two NIRS device , INVOS™ 5100c Cerebral/Somatic Oximeter 2 wavelength , diffuse reflectance spectroscopy system employ near infrared light estimate percentage hemoglobin saturate oxygen tissue underneath sensor . An adhesive sensor contain light source 2 photodiodes apply skin tissue interest return light analyze oxyhemoglobin deoxyhemoglobin light absorption . Absorption signal photodiode close light source subtract far photodiode return photon penetrate deeply tissue . This suppress absorption event originate outer layer tissue common photodiodes , include effect skin pigmentation subcutaneous tissue . This method `` spatial resolution '' also allow estimation scatter improve measurement accuracy . This non-invasive device Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve ( FDA 510k # K082327 ) , intend use infant weight great 2.5 Kg . Given target population study weight description use , use cerebral oxygen monitoring , order approve Institutional Board Review ( IRB ) committee . The investigator catalogue non-significant risk device Investigational Device Exemption ( IDE ) , 21 CFR 812 . The device four channel light sensor retrieve lecture splanchnic ( left flank ) , mesenteric ( infra-umbilical ) , muscular ( either right leave thigh ) cerebral ( forehead ) area . The NIRS sensor Cerebral ( IS-C ) Somatic ( IS-S ) Infant/Neonatal Somatic OxyAlert® attach directly infant skin order obtain area lecture . The case diagnose feed intolerant attend physician staff patient least 50ml/Kg/day enteral feeding approach . Once case attach NIRS device , selection match control take place , feed tolerate infant ( least 50 mL/Kg/day ) share gestational range age gender possible . The study coordinator obtain consent parent ( ) ; family opportunity speak Physician investigator ( PI ) . All staff member certify CITI program ( Collaborative IRB Training Initiative ) ensure discuss protocol infant 's parent ( ) guardian . After sensor attach data record display monitor turn , data extract analyzed . Confounders measurement The study design allow minimize confounders restriction ( inclusion exclusion criterion ) , risk population , match case . Low perfusion status need assess monitoring vital sign ( HR , RR , BP ) pulse-oximetry ( SpO2 ) . Outcomes measurement Clinical outcome data correlate tissue oxygen saturation ( TOI ) NIRS device , outcomes variable include : length NICU stay , morbidity , mortality , feed tolerance , advance feeding abdominal sign intolerance , abdominal distension , gastric residue great 50 % intermittent bolus . Other variable record , infant perinatal history , level oxygen requirement , ventilatory support status , morbidity associate , laboratory study , vital sign parenteral nutrition status . oxygen saturation standard pulse oximetry , formula and/or human milk feeding status , follow discharge Hospital , look length stay , development Necrotizing enterocolitis , and/or Broncho-pulmonary dysplasia . The data extract clinical record ( EPIC System ) .</detailed_description>
