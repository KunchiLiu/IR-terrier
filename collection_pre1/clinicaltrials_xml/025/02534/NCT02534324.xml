	<brief_summary>The current guideline asymptomatic severe hypertension ( ASH ) treatment emergency department ( ED ) recommend low level evidence patient rapidly decrease BP ED instead receive oral antihypertensive treatment close outpatient follow-up need . Unfortunately , ambiguity time point BP measurement ED describe past literature high BP ED admission may significantly decrease within hour without medication . The importance pre-ED discharge BP , still critically high , may affect follow-up outcome never investigate . The study aim study evaluate physician ' treatment strategy well immediate clinical outcome patient severely- moderately-elevated pre-discharge BP management ASH ED recent recommendation . The secondary outcome compare BP follow-up two group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Pre-discharge Blood Pressure Patients With Asymptomatic Severe Hypertension Emergency Department</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator follow patient asymptomatic severe hypertension attend ED King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital ( KCMH ) , urban , 1,500-bed , university-affiliated , tertiary care hospital well treatment strategy . A management strategy whether start drug ED without period observation immediately discharge without observation depend treat physician ' judgment . The investigator predefined pre-discharge BP ED two group ; high BP ( pre-discharge SBP &lt; 180 mmHg ) severely high BP ( pre-discharge SBP &gt; = 180mmHg ) group . Every eligible patient schedule internal medicine clinic continuous care high blood pressure within 3-7 day discharge . Medical record retrieve follow-up BP , compliance associate adverse event clinic . The investigator make telephone follow-ups participant contact personnel every case 10 day ED presentation identify decease case major morbidity well compliance medication .</detailed_description>
