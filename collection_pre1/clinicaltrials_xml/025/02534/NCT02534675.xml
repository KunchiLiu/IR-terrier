	<brief_summary>The purpose study learn personalize cancer therapy include response treatment side effect . Information patient 's medical record regarding test treatment receive , receive , cancer collect . Genomic test tissue primary tumor metastasis use match therapy recommendation . Patients appropriate match therapy receive systemic chemotherapy accord treat physician 's discretion . This information use describe whether patient respond good physician choose treat accord genetic makeup tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Molecular Profile-Related Evidence Determine Individualized Therapy Advanced Poor Prognosis Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , open label navigational investigation evaluate feasibility use molecular profile-based evidence determine individualize cancer therapy patient incurable malignancy . This non-randomized , histology-agnostic trial . While know individual histology compose heterogeneous mix genomic alteration , clear one case mix well worse another . Thus , strategy molecular matching may apply across cancer test . All eligible consented patient tumor tissue genomic profile Foundation Medicine 's FoundationOne genomic analysis . Patients stratify Group 1 ( treatment naïve , unresectable/medically unfit surgery ) , Group 2 ( treatment naïve , metastatic ) , Group 3 ( prior treat ) , respectively . Following analysis genomic alteration , match therapy , available , recommend Study Committee Molecular Tumor Board . If patient receive matched therapy , designate Arm A . Otherwise , patient receive unmatched therapy ( i.e. , treat physician 's choice traditional systemic chemotherapy ) , designate Arm B . The study feasibility measure ability enroll patient , acceptable turnaround time actionable information obtain genomic profiling , viability identify deliver match therapy . The treatment efficacy determine among patient group treatment arm . The safety profile treatment also assess .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients incurable malignancy ≥50 % 2year cancerassociated mortality ( estimate 2 physician appropriate accord 2014 National Cancer Database ) . Patients must least one follow diagnosis/disease status : Unresectable disease Metastatic disease Medically unfit surgical resection expect survival &gt; 3 month Disease conventional therapy lead survival benefit &gt; 6 month Actionable alteration determine FoundationOne assay For Groups 1 2 , treatment naïve newly diagnose malignancy ; patient must treat antitumor agent . For Group 3 , ≥1 prior unmatched systemic therapy regimen ( prior match therapy permit immediately prior therapy ) . Patients must antitumor agent least 5 halflives agent 4 week last day treatment , whichever short . Patients must measurable disease solid tumor . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance Status 0 1 . New York Hearth Association ( NYHA ) Functional Classification I II . Adequate organ marrow function . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Disagreement two oncologist prognosis resectability . Severe uncontrolled medical disorder would , investigator 's opinion , confound study analyse treatment response .</criteria>
