	<brief_summary>Pain assessment infant toddler quite challenge since child population nonverbal preverbal describe presence severity pain perceive . Over last decade , advance field include development behavioral score system assessment acute pain . However , although validate , commonly use method pain assessment largely subjective rely highly trained observer . An objective continuous measure pain would important addition standard behavioral painscores require nurse monitor child 's behavioral response .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>After standard general anesthetic mask induction , 0.5 ml blood draw genetic analysis intravenous catheter sit . A member research team manually transport appropriately-labeled blood collection tube Department Anesthesiology Perioperative Genomics Laboratory storage preparation genetic analysis . The sample store investigator enough process . The result store secure database . The surgical procedure , anesthesia technique , intraoperative analgesia treatment initial postoperative analgesia treatment standardized.Upon arrival Post-Anesthesia Care Unit ( PACU ) , child connect standard monitor per standard care . Pain score record scale 0-10 ( FLACC , Face , legs , activity , cry , consolability scale ) scale . A member research team apply skin conductance ( SC ) monitor child 's hand foot.This use measure SC value save laptop computer SC data analyze off-line .</detailed_description>
