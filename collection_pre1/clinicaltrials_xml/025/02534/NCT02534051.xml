	<brief_title>A Clinical Care Pathway Obese Pregnant Women : A Pilot Cluster RCT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>STUDY DESIGN : Investigators propose pilot cluster RCT 1:1 allocation ratio clinic randomize clinical care pathway obese pregnant woman ( intervention group ) versus standard care ( control group ) . Investigators follow SPIRIT statement ( Standard Protocol Items : Recommendations Interventional Trials ) RANDOMIZATION : The unit randomization clinic providing pregnancy care . All pregnant woman meet inclusion criterion clinic randomize intervention receive intervention , pregnant woman meet inclusion criterion clinic randomize usual care receive usual care . Investigators use 1:1 allocation intervention control group , pair randomization type clinic ( obstetrician-lead versus midwife-lead , since likely differ regard patient characteristic health care , pair aid provide reasonable balance characteristic small sample size . ) Investigators generate randomization sequence use www.randomization.com . The randomization seed obstetrical clinic `` 21262 '' randomization seed midwifery clinic `` 23340 '' . STUDY PROCESS : Clinics randomly allocate intervention control group , pair fashion ( one two midwifery clinic randomize intervention group control , give clinical care woman clinic likely similar two clinic ) . As study involve minimal/no-risk intervention , Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Board ( HiREB ) approve clinic randomize eligible woman intervention clinic receive intervention ( eligible woman control clinic receive routine care ) ; give intervention standard care , individual participant consent require . Informed , write consent staff clinic randomize intervention obtain prior semi-structured interview end study . Investigators plan interim analysis give minimal/no-risk nature intervention , pilot nature study , hence investigator Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) , Steering Commitee . DATA COLLECTION : Data collect end pregnancy : 1 . 2-page Antenatal Records mandate Ministry Health : baseline characteristics* , clinical process outcomes 2. clinical care path ( intervention group ) : feasibility 3. clinic hospital chart : process clinical outcome 4. care provider survey structure interview ( intervention group ) : provider outcome . - Baseline characteristic include : maternal age , education level , pre-existing diabetes hypertension co-morbidities , gestational age upon first visit randomize clinic , pre-pregnancy body mass index , gravidity , parity . SAMPLE SIZE : Investigators provide sample size justification , rather calculation follow reason : 1 . 'In general , sample size calculation may require pilot study ' 2 . Given feasibility study , design statistical power detect difference 2 treatment group . 3 . The size intraclass correlation coefficient ( ICC ) require sample size calculation currently unknown . The sample size base feasibility consideration follow : Investigators conservatively estimate would total 142 participant available ( 71 per group ) 10 month recruitment , 8 clinic , 80 % woman intervention clinic receive intervention , ( 100 % woman control group receive usual care ) , variable rate obesity 20-30 % depend clinic , variable proportion woman present clinic prenatal care &lt; 20 weeks+6 day gestation range 15 % obstetrician-lead clinic 85 % midwifery-lead clinic ) . This number patient , 71 per group , exceed one common number sample size pilot study , `` least 50 per group '' , since additional power require cluster design . STATISTICAL ANALYSES : Baseline characteristic co-morbid condition compare woman receive intervention versus control group . Since design study involve pair randomization , hence pair analysis perform . Continuous data compare use paired test mean ( standard deviation ) Wilcoxon test pair median ( interquartile range ) , appropriate . Paired proportion categorical variable compare use McNemar 's test . The analysis primary outcome , feasibility , base descriptive statistic proportion ( % ) woman intervention group care path complete , care provider would recommend . Analysis do patient level exception care provider outcome . Investigators use intention treat analysis , i.e . outcome eligible woman intervention clinic evaluate within intervention group whether receive intervention . The analysis secondary outcome ( process outcomes clinical outcome ) do use McNemar 's test compare pair proportion woman intervention group receive recommend care proportion woman control group . Investigators perform sensitivity analysis : 1 ) `` per-protocol analysis '' , i.e . per-clinical care path compare woman intervention clinic clinical care path actually use woman ( intervention clinic receive clinical care path control group ) ; 2 ) compare result woman without complete data . Investigators perform subgroup analysis examine outcomes obstetrician clinic separately midwifery clinic . Potential covariates may evenly distribute intervention control group control ( e.g . age , socioeconomic status , etc ) . Since observation within participate clinic assume likely similar observation clinic , logistic model use conditional ( pair data ) generalize estimate equation ( GEE ) method perform account cluster effect within clinic , incorporate within-clinic between-clinic variation . An intracluster correlation coefficient ( ICC ) variance inflation factor ( VIF ) also calculate assess impact cluster effect . Results consider statistically significant two-sided alpha=0.05 . A modified Bonferroni correction use give multiple secondary outcome . Analyses perform use SAS-PC statistical software ( version 9.2 ; SAS institute Inc , Cary , NC ) .

Maternal weight weight gain focus research program . She oversee aspect study .

Collaborator : Cindy Maxwell , MD , co-author national guideline care obese pregnant woman , head obesity clinic pregnant woman Mount Sinai Hospital Toronto . Clinicians whose clinic would potential recruitment site continue involve phase study development care pathway .</detailed_description>
