	<brief_title>Bergonie Institut Profiling : Fighting Cancer Matching Molecular Alterations Drugs Early Phase Trials</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The need 'personalize ' cancer therapy recognize , specific biomarkers use direct targeted agent patient deem likely respond . This `` personalized cancer medicine '' require two critical step : first , comprehensive assessment biological characteristic tumor individual , second , validated biomarkers identify subgroup patient likely benefit give therapy next-generation sequencing provide unprecedented opportunity draw comprehensive picture genetic aberration involve immunotherapy sensitivity ultimately enable individualized treatment . The main objective study use next generation sequence technology identify actionable molecular alteration cancer patient advance disease include study . This study provide fully integrated view molecular profile tumor patient include study . Such tumor profile use clinician tailor therapy patient specific early phase clinical trial .</detailed_description>
