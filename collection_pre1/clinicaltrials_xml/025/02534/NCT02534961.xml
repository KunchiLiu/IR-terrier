	<brief_title>Prophylactic Antibiotics Before RFA HCC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients 1 . This cohort study prospectively enroll HCC patient undergo RFA Taipei Veterans General Hospital Taipei Medical University Hospital . 2 . The diagnosis HCC establish histology basis finding typical radiologic feature 4-phase multidetector compute tomography ( CT ) scan dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . 3 . Inclusion criterion : tumor size le 5 cm without extra-hepatic metastasis ; number tumor 3 less ; Child Pugh classification liver function grade A B ; absence major disease might complicate RFA . 4 . Patients exclude study meet follow criterion . First , patient 's age younger 20 year old 80 year . Second , patient terminal illness major organ system , like heart failure , uremia , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , non-hepatic malignancy . Third , patient receive antibiotic within last 2 week . Patients subsequently exclude initial bacteriological sampling turn positive ( occult infection ) . 5 . After disinfection skin surface induction local anesthesia 1 % lidocaine , RFA perform real-time ultrasonography guidance , RF electrode advance tumor . RFA device use Cool-Tip Radiofrequency System ( Radionics , Burlington , MA ) . With Cool-Tip device , treatment perform single ( 2- 3-cm active tip ) needle electrode . Each tumor 1-4 ablation per session , depend tumor size . If tumor adjacent hollow viscera displace safe margin least 2 cm position patient oblique lateral position , 5 % dextrose intraperitoneally instill around liver displace hollow viscera . 6 . After RFA , patient undergo immediate follow-up ultrasonography evaluate possibility bleed fluid accumulation . Dynamic CT scan MRI do one month tumor ablate RFA . When confirm residual tumor show contrast enhancement arterial phase wash venous phase , second session RFA conduct . If viable tumor persist two session RFA therapy , treatment consider failure . If viable tumor detect , patient regularly followed-up abdominal sonography every 3 month . 7 . Tumor recurrence suspect elevated serum AFP level new lesion detect surveillance ultrasonography . These would confirm dynamic CT MRI . Local recurrence define tumor recurrence segment previous tumor site , intra-hepatic distant recurrence diagnose new lesion occur different segment previously treat tumor . Randomization Patients fulfil inclusion criterion immediately randomize two treatment group use consecutively number envelope contain treatment assignment , generate computer-allocated random digit number , 1:1 ratio . Patients prophylactic group receive antibiotic treatment right randomization intravenous cefazolin 2 g ( 3 g patient weigh ≥120 kg ) within 60 minute ablation therapy . Patients on-demand group receive antibiotic therapy infection suspect establish . Antibiotics change accord antibiotic sensitivity test culture microorganism . Infection Assessment All patient closely monitor special emphasis detection bacterial infection hospitalization period . A careful physical examination , complete white blood cell count , chest radiography , urine sediment , urine culture , ascitic fluid neutrophil count culture ( available ) , blood culture routinely perform randomization . Physical examination perform least per day hospitalization . If new infection suspect , procedures assess infection would perform admission . New infection suspect fever ( &gt; 38°C ) , hypothermia ( &lt; 36°C ) , unexpected hemodynamic instability , tachypnea , new onset chest symptom , dysuria , abdominal pain , distention , well alteration mental state . A central venous catheter urinary catheter would insert clinically indicate . Clinical Assessment Follow-up Body temperature measure every 6 hour 72 hour . Acetaminophen 500 mg use patient complain pain high grade fever 39°C procedure . The number peripheral blood leukocyte , well level serum alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) , blood urea nitrogen ( BUN ) , creatinine , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) infection sign description determine , 24 hour , 3-7 day 4 week ablation therapy . Dynamic CT scan MRI do one month tumor ablate RFA order estimate effectiveness RFA HCC , whether liver abscess , cholangitis , cholangitis peritonitis present . If new infection suspect within one month RFA , Dynamic CT scan MRI do immediately . Post-procedure infection define Guideline Prevention Surgical Site Infection , 1999 , Centers Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ) . Safety Assessment Adverse Events Adverse event record investigator hospitalization 4-week out-patient follow-up visit . Statistical Analysis Pearson chi-square analysis Fisher 's exact test use compare categorical variable , Mann-Whitney U-test would use compare continuous variable . Variables statistical significance ( p &lt; 0.05 ) proximate ( p &lt; 0.1 ) univariate analysis underwent multivariate analysis use Cox 's forward stepwise logistic regression model . A two-tailed p value &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant . All statistical analysis perform use Statistical Package Social Sciences ( SPSS 19.0 Windows , SPSS . Inc. , Chicago , IL , USA ) . The infection rate patient HCC RFA , without special emphasis antibiotic treatment , 1.5-3 % . Estimates sample size base infection rate assume 1 % prophylactic antibiotic group 5 % on-demand antibiotic group . The type I ( alpha ) error type II ( beta ) error set 0.05 0.2 , respectively . The sample size need estimate least 282 patient per group . Taking account expect dropout miss data rate 5 % , sample size need estimate least 594 patient . Consequently , plan enroll total 600 patient study .</detailed_description>
