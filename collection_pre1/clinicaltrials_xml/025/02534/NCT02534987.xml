	<brief_summary>As nation continue effort contain healthcare cost improve quality , healthcare information technology provide potent yet underutilized tool . Clinical prediction rule frontline decision aid combine state-of-the-art evidence real-time patient history , physical examination , laboratory data . While often well-validated , clinical prediction rule underutilized practice . Recently , team develop integrated clinical prediction rule ( iCPR ) system , embed CPRs within nation 's large commercial electronic health record ( EHR ) system . Using novel system , demonstrate high rate provider utilization significant reduction antibiotic prescribing diagnostic test ordering among suspected case strep throat pneumonia single healthcare facility . The objective propose project generalize platform across diverse setting create toolkit dissemination . Building success original iCPR project , specific aim proposal ( 1 ) integrate previously test refine iCPR tool commercial EHR three different clinical setting , adapt innovation provider preference , culture , local workflow rather impose rigidly standardized tool , ( 2 ) identify measure rate variability iCPR uptake across different setting , ( 3 ) determine iCPR impact antibiotic prescribing diagnostic test-ordering pattern across diverse clinical setting randomize controlled trial , ( 4 ) use well-established theory-driven implementation framework identify facilitator barrier integration setting , develop toolkit adapt implement tool diverse setting . To achieve aim , propose five-year study first adapt , integrate usability-test original iCPR three new diverse site . We conduct two-year randomized control trial one-year post-trial open-access observation period determine persistence : 1 ) tool 's utilization 2 ) impact antibiotic- test-ordering patient suspect strep throat pneumonia . In final year , study finding compile toolkit healthcare facility use Epic EHR integrate iCPR ambulatory workflow . The study use several innovative significant approach , include : 1 ) adapt nation 's widespread commercial EHR system ; 2 ) build new tool `` off-the-shelf '' technology include every Epic EHR package , innovation easily port Epic EHR user ; 3 ) use highly specific , well-validated clinical prediction rule core content ; 4 ) guide integration process highly generalizable usability test technique ; 5 ) use hybrid RE-AIM normalization process theory implementation evaluation framework . Together , innovative approach make iCPR uniquely suit overcome longstanding barrier integrate disseminate evidence-based tool primary care workflow point care real time .</brief_summary>
