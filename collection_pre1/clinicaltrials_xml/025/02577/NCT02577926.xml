	<brief_summary>The Philadelphia chromosome negative myeloproliferative neoplasm ( MPN ) comprise group clonal hematological malignancy characterize chronic myeloproliferation , splenomegaly , different degree bone marrow fibrosis , disease-related symptom include pruritus , night sweat , fever , weight loss , cachexia , diarrhea . In addition , due elevate number leucocyte , erythrocytes and/or platelet , disease course complicate thromboembolic disease , hemorrhage , leukemic transformation well myelofibrosis . Patients polycythemia vera ( PV ) typically harbor increase number blood cell three hematopoietic cell lineage due clonal amplification hematopoetic stem cell , patient essential thrombocythemia ( ET ) typically show predominant expansion megakaryocytic lineage . Most patient PV age 60 year currently treat acetylsalicylic acid +/- phlebotomy , patient low-risk ET almost normal life expectancy often require specific treatment . However , PV- well ET-patients high risk complication require cytoreductive treatment . In addition , constitutional symptom unbearable patient even absence bona fide high risk factor , patient may similarly benefit antineoplastic therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Polycythemia vera ( PV ) essential thrombocythemia ( ET ) classical Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasm ( MPN ) characterize excess cell peripheral blood , clonal bone marrow hyperplasia , extramedullary hematopoiesis . The symptoms patient may range asymptomatic disease symptomatic disease may significantly affect activity daily live , severe generalize pruritus , night sweat fever , erythromelalgia , bone muscle pain , weight loss , fatigue . Moreover , patient may develop thromboembolic hemorrhagic complication , transition myelofibrosis ( MF ) , transformation acute leukemia . In principle , potentially curative therapy MPNs allogenic stem cell transplantation ( allo-SCT ) . However , due significant transplant-associated morbidity mortality , therapeutic option apply exceptional case ET PV . The majority patient qualify allo-SCT since risk treatment clearly outweigh potential benefit . Moreover , even non-transplantation approach , patient ET PV life expectancy comparable close healthy age-matched control person . For patient standard risk PV , phlebotomy acetylsalicylic acid standard care ( target hematocrit 45 % ) , patient standard risk ET receive either specific treatment acetylsalicylic acid ( provide microvascular symptom secondary acquire von Willebrand syndrome present ) . However , patient high risk develop thromboembolic hemorrhagic complication ( high-risk patient ) , cytoreductive treatment generally indicate prevent potentially life-threatening complication . In PV ET , high risk patient characterize advanced age ( &gt; 60 year ) / history thromboembolic hemorrhagic event { 1,2,3 } . In ET , platelet count &gt; 1500 x 109/l associate increase risk bleeding , thus result platelet lower treatment { 2 } . In PV , addition risk-score base therapy , cytoreduction also require patient progressive mark myeloproliferation ( leukocytosis , thrombocytosis , symptomatic splenomegaly , increase frequency phlebotomy requirement ) , devastate constitutional symptom { 1,2,4 } . In Germany , best available therapy ( BAT ) include approved drug hydroxyurea ( HU ; approve PV ET ) anagrelide ( approved second-line treatment ET ) non-approved option alpha-interferon , pipobroman , busulfan ( elderly patient ) , radioactive phosphorus ( 32P ) . In rare case , patient may also benefit splenic irradiation splenectomy . Ruxolitinib JAK1/2-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) approve treatment symptomatic myelofibrosis . The compound show superior hydroxyurea reduce splenomegaly constitutional symptom . Ruxolitinib currently study phase 2 phase 3 clinical trial HU-resistant HU-intolerant PV ET . The aim present study assess feasibility , efficacy , safety ruxolitinib treatment v . BAT patient high-risk PV -ET .</detailed_description>
