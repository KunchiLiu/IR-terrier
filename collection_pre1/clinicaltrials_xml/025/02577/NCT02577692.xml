	<brief_summary>High inspiratory oxygen fraction know induce oxidative stress lipid peroxidation . The degrading product oxidative stress induce lipid peroxidation part volatile appear breath measure non-invasively . However , lack knowledge correlation blood breath biomarkers oxidative stress . This study aim investigate effect high inspiratory oxygen fraction oxidative stress healthy volunteer . The primary outcome appearance exhale breath biomarkers oxidative stress electrochemical sensor ion mobility mass spectrometry . Secondary outcome change oxidative stress biomarkers blood relationship breath biomarkers .</brief_summary>
