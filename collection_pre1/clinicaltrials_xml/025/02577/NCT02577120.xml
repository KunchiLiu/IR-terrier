	<detailed_description>This prospective pilot study enroll patient clinically-defined infected wound . Patients enrol study follow 16 week wound closure ( Phase A ) , begin Phase B . Wounds subject Standard Care ( SoC ) follow Comprehensive Wound Center ( CWC ) wind physician first 16 week . Trans - Epidermal Water Loss ( TEWL ) measure handheld , non-invasive device , VapoMeter® Closed-Chambered device use DermaLab TEWL probe . Both device use read device . They place subject skin read TEWL measurement . When device place skin , measurement take 7-20 second standard adapter . Study visit 1 include inform consent sign , baseline information collect , 2 biopsy collect unless wound appropriate biopsy patient choose receive biopsy swab culture collect , wound image , quality life survey complete subject . The patient medical chart follow 16 week follow visit 1 . At 16 week ( +/- 1 week ) within 10 day wound closure whichever come first , subject return study visit 2 . If target wound ( ) yet heal visit , visit part Standard Care visit per CWC . The patient 's study participation end visit wound data collect , digital imaging wound ( ) quality life survey complete subject . If target wound determine visual inspection heal prior visit , research visit ; patient continue Phase B . Phase B continuation study visit 2 . Various information collect data collection sheet , digital imaging TEWL measurement record . The TEWL device place skin . There 5 measurement obtain close wound site . A reference ( control ) TEWL measurement take intact skin anatomically match site patient . A high TEWL/ defective closure define TEWL value =2 time value patient 's control measurement . Patients meet criterion randomize one four group : EpiCeram treatment , Ceramiseal treatment , Vaseline treatment treatment . Patients randomized treatment group supply study product instruct apply twice daily close wound site remain week study . All High TEWL patient ask return Study Visits 3-6 . Distribution study product applicable . For study , low TEWL/ adequate closure define value le 2 time value patient 's control measurement . Patients meet criterion randomize treatment group , continue receive standard care per physician ask return study visit 3 , 4 , 6 . During last visit follow activity occur : TEWL measurement , digital imaging , sequential tape strip measure ceramide level skin ( 20 tape strip obtain ) . TEWL measurement obtain prior tape stripping . The tape strip complete TEWL measurement obtain , wound site evaluation , various lab , medication review , distribution study product ( High TEWL ) review compliance quality life survey complete subject ( visit 6 ) . There may discomfort tissue biopsy procedure depend amount sensation subject site wound numb apply local anesthesia appropriate area biopsied . The amount pain occur wound biopsy vary person person , effort make minimize pain within boundary exist wound avoid give patient separate new wound . Bleeding possible complication , risk low small biopsy reduce use local anesthetic epinephrine , silver nitrate stick available patient room cauterize biopsy site need . Infection also potential risk ; however , wound tissue biopsy routinely perform standard care CWC diagnose wound infection . The biopsy site appropriately monitor infection physician manage wound routine wound clinic visits.Possible risk use ceramide emulsion EpiCeram® temporary tingling sensation ( 10-15 minute ) extremely low risk allergic reaction . If occurs application cream stop immediately . Possible risk use Vaseline Petroleum Ceramiseal™ low stop allergic reaction occurs.There minor redness discomfort site tape strip . The skin remain intact , i.e . epidermis breached tape strip procedure make less minimal risk . TEWL measurement noninvasive propose less minimal risk .</detailed_description>
