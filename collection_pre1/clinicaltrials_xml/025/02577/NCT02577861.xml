	<brief_summary>The purpose trial confirm efficacy Holoclar one year first treatment patient suffer moderate severe LSCD ( Limbal Stem Cell Deficiency ) secondary ocular burn . In case failure treatment upon clinical indication Principal Investigator , second transplant Holoclar offer eligibility confirm . The efficacy two treatment Holoclar one year last treatment also evaluate . All patient followed-up 12 month implant determine treatment efficacy Independent Assessor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Autologous Cultivated Limbal Stem Cells Transplantation ( ACLSCT ) Restoration Corneal Epithelium Patients With Limbal Stem Cell Deficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multinational , multicentre , prospective , open label , uncontrolled clinical trial . Patients screen accord Study Inclusion Exclusion criterion candidate ACLSCT eligibility criterion meet . Patients undergo limbal biopsy collection limbal stem cell product manufacturing . The confirmation eligibility criterion follow roll-in phase approximately 6 month . At end roll-in period , Holoclar implant specific surgical procedure . After ACLSCT , efficacy assessment perform 1 , 3 , 6 , 9 12 month first second treatment ( latter applicable ) . One year transplantation , efficacy adjudicate two independent assessor ( primary key secondary endpoint ) study completion reach 1 year follow-up last transplant last patient accomplish .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1 . Written inform consent prior studyrelated procedure . 2 . Adult male female patient ( â‰¥18 year old ) ; Five Paediatric patient age 2 17 year also enrol safety purpose . 3 . LSCD secondary unilateral bilateral physical chemical ocular burn , least 12 mm2 undamaged limbus harvest stem cell expansion culture . LSCD consider inclusion presence superficial neovascularization invade least two corneal quadrant central corneal involvement ( include corneal neovascularisation , corneal opacity corneal dyschromia ) accord independent assessor ; 4 . Stability LSCD , define duration disease least 24 month time Screening Visit presence continuum epithelium per fluorescein staining score none trace . 5 . Presence severe impairment visual acuity define score 1/10th 20/200 Snellen chart ( legal blindness ) best correction ( i.e . Best Corrected Visual Acuity ) ; 6 . Absence clinical contraindication ACLSC transplantation base upon investigator 's judgment ; 7 . A cooperative attitude follow study procedure ( Caregivers case minor ) . 1 . LSCD mild degree ( i.e . 2 quadrant neovessel invasion without central corneal ) , due recent burn ( less 24 month screen ) , secondary medical condition burn ( i.e . radiotherapy ) ; 2 . Severe ocular inflammation accord Efron Grading Scale Contact Lens Complications . Patient rescreened appropriate treatment ; 3 . Presence eyelids malposition ; 4 . Conjunctival scar fornix shortening ; 5 . Severe tear secretion deficiency , determine Schirmer 's test type I ( &lt; 5 mm/ 5 min ) ; 6 . Corneal anaesthesia conjunctival anaesthesia ; 7 . Active local systemic infection time screen . Patient rescreened appropriate treatment ; 8 . Diagnosis local systemic neoplastic disease ; 9 . Congenital disease ( i.e. , Aniridia ) ; 10 . Bilateral inflammatory disease ( i.e . StevensJohnson syndrome , phemphigoid ) ; 11 . A preexist blindness preclude functional recovery ; 12 . Female subject : pregnant lactate woman woman physiologically capable become pregnant ( i.e . woman childbearing potential ) UNLESS willing use one reliable method contraception ( i.e . contraceptive method oral contraceptive , IUD , tubal ligature ) . Reliable contraception maintain throughout study . Any postmenopausal woman ( physiologic menopause define `` 12 consecutive month amenorrhea '' ) woman permanently sterilize ( e.g . tubal occlusion , hysterectomy bilateral salpingectomy ) may enrol study . Parental control apply pediatric population need . 13 . Allergy , sensitivity intolerance concomitant drug excipients ( Hypersensitivity excipients list section 6.1 bovine serum murine 3T3J2 cell ) ; 14 . Contraindications local systemic antibiotic and/ corticosteroid foreseen protocol ; 15 . Contraindications surgical procedure ; 16 . Clinically significant unstable concurrent disease clinical contraindication stem cell transplantation base upon investigator 's judgment concomitant medical condition affect grafting procedure ; 17 . Patients ( parent case paediatric subject ) unlikely comply study protocol unable understand nature scope study possible benefit unwanted effect study procedures treatment . 18 . Participation another clinical trial investigational drug receive less 4 week prior screen visit .</criteria>
