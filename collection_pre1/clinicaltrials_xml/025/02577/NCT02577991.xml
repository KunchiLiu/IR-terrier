	<brief_title>Effect Local Steroid Application Cervical Plate Versus Intravenous Steroids Dysphagia Following Anterior Cervical Discectomy Fusion ( ACDF )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dysphagia common complication ACDF . PSTS also natural sequela ACDF lead airway compromise among complication . Previous study demonstrate administration intravenous methylprednisolone ( 1mg/kg ) anterior cervical spine surgery reduce incidence pharyngolaryngeal lesion identify nasofibroscopic examination . Lee et al . prospectively evaluate 50 patient determine local application steroid retropharyngeal area follow ACDF reduce PSTS odynophagia measure Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) Neck Disability Index ( NDI ) compare control group . Furthermore , adverse events/reactions local application steroid gel foam sponge set anterior spinal surgery . There study current literature investigate incidence dysphagia application local steroid ACDF , study stratify efficacy local steroid compare intravenous steroid . There also current spine literature directly compare efficacy intravenous steroid versus local steroid incidence dysphagia dysphonia . Our study first literature ass efficacy local steroid reduce incidence dysphagia anterior cervical spine surgery , result , may improve patient outcomes ACDF . Dysphagia dysphonia common complication anterior cervical spine surgery . Despite clinical importance , study treatment and/or prevention complication limit due lack valid reliable outcome measure . The majority research find otolaryngology literature focus disease pathophysiology , diagnosis , therapy . The Bazaz score use spine literature evaluate dysphagia anterior cervical discectomy fusion ( ACDF ) . This subjective questionnaire validate literature . Additionally , new patient-centered outcome measure , Eating Assessment Tool ( EAT-10 ) Voice Handicap Index ( VHI-10 ) recently develop , addition Bazaz score , show excellent validity reliability ENT patient population . These instrument use document initial dysphagia dysphonia severity monitor treatment response people wide array swallow voice disorder .</detailed_description>
