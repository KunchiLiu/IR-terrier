	<brief_summary>Traumatic injury lead cause morbidity mortality young adult , remain substantial economic health care burden . Despite decade promise preclinical clinical investigation trauma , investigator understand entity still incomplete , therapy show success . During severe trauma , bone marrow granulocyte store rapidly release peripheral circulation . This release subsequently induce expansion repopulation empty evacuate space hematopoietic stem cell ( HSCs ) . Although patient experience early loss bone marrow myeloid-derived cell , stem cell expansion largely skew towards repopulation myeloid lineage/compartment . The hypothesis 'emergency myelopoiesis ' critical survival severely traumatize , failure emergency myelopoietic response associate global immunosuppression susceptibility secondary infection . Also , identify release myeloid derive suppressor cell ( MDSCs ) circulation human severe trauma subject . This process driven HSCs bone marrow trauma subject . Additionally , MDSCs may profound effect nutritional status host . The appearance MDSCs trauma associate loss muscle tissue subject . This muscle loss possible increase catabolism huge effect long term outcome subject . It investigator 's goal understand difference occur HSCs muscle cell oppose non-injured non-infected control . This work lead well understanding myelopoietic catabolic response follow trauma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hematopoietic Stem Cell Dysfunction Elderly After Severe Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective study understand trauma injury change hematopoeitic stem cell ( HSCs ) bone marrow muscle cell trauma injury elderly subject different compare non-injured subject . There three group study : 1 ) Elective hip surgery subject , 2 ) Trauma subject 3 ) deidentified bone marrow healthy control . Samples bone marrow , muscle tissue , blood sample collect time surgery . The deidentified bone marrow healthy control come tissue bank . The blood use perform PB colony assay , ELISAs test follow parameter : EPO , G-CSF , Reticulocyte , iron level cytokine inflammatory marker . The bone marrow , muscle tissue , blood sample process sorted isolate hematopoeitic stem cell genomic content determine genomic expression , oxidative stress , mitochondrial activity , apoptosis , autophagy , analysis circulate erythroid progenitor cell , reticulocyte , granulocyte-colony stimulating factor assay , erythropoietin iron level . Clinical data hemodynamic measurement collect daily subject hospitalize trauma surgery subject follow evaluate malunion subsequent additional surgical procedure repair .</detailed_description>
