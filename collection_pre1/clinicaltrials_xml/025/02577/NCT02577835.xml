	<brief_summary>This Registry investigator-initiated , international , multicenter , observational , prospective study aiming : ) evaluate non-invasive 24-h ambulatory blood pressure arterial stiffness estimate ( 24-h pulse wave analysis ) hypertensive subject ; ii ) assessing change estimate follow treatment ; iii ) weigh impact 24-h pulse wave analysis target organ damage cardiovascular prognosis ; iv ) assess relationship arterial stiffness , blood pressure absolute level variability , prognosis . Approximately 2000 subject , refer 20 hypertension clinic routine diagnostic evaluation follow-up hypertension , recruit . Data collection include ambulatory blood pressure monitoring , perform device allow simultaneous non-invasive assessment blood pressure arterial stiffness , clinical data ( include cardiovascular outcome ) . A web-based telemedicine platform use data collection . Subjects visit center 6-12 month interval . First follow-up result expect available next 2-years . The result Registry help define normalcy threshold current future index derive 24-h pulse wave velocity , accord outcome data . They also provide support evidence inclusion evaluation recommendation hypertension management .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>International Registry Ambulatory Blood Pressure Arterial Stiffness Telemonitoring</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The VASOTENS Registry international , multicenter , observational , prospective project Actually , large database ambulatory blood pressure recording obtain non-invasive device , able determine central blood pressure various index arterial stiffness ( mainly pulse wave velocity augmentation index ) 24-hours , base clinically validated technology pulse wave analysis oscillometric blood pressure measurement , integrate ambulatory blood pressure monitor . Specifically , project aim create international network center perform ambulatory blood pressure monitor arterial stiffness monitoring , order evaluate impact estimate clinical outcome hypertensive patient . The result data collect baseline regular follow-up hypertensive patient ( 2 year ) help provide evidence clinical usefulness technology screen follow-up hypertensive patient . The registry include data subject fulfil inclusion criterion whose data contain exist database collect participate center regularly followed-up center . New subject enrol project , must submit ambulatory blood pressure monitoring require evaluate hypertension status , accord current recommendation . Data collection ensure dedicated web-based telemedicine platform , include electronic case report form ( e-CRF ) . The e-CRF allows collection patient 's clinical data , family history , anthropometric data , habit , past current disease , therapy , office blood pressure , laboratory test , include evaluation target organ damage . The project involve type intervention relate study physician manage patient include Registry accord requirement clinical practice current guideline . However , recommend current guideline , patient followed-up visit occur regular interval ( ideally every 6 month , less year ) . The physician also free use ambulatory blood pressure data clinical management patient . At least 30 Hypertension center plan involve project , one providing least 100 patient , followed-up time . Centers select different country , initially Europe , start Italy Russia . Mandatory criterion center include study availability facility BPLab ambulatory blood pressure monitor , potential provide properly following-up number patient require protocol , availability Internet connection , regular access web human resource upload ambulatory blood pressure clinical data .</detailed_description>
