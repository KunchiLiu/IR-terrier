	<brief_summary>This international , multicenter , open-label , randomize , Phase 3 study compare efficacy safety AG-221 versus conventional care regimen ( CCRs ) subject 60 year old acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) refractory relapse second- third-line AML therapy positive isocitrate dehydrogenase ( IDH2 ) mutation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Efficacy Safety Study AG-221 ( CC-90007 ) Versus Conventional Care Regimens Older Subjects With Late Stage Acute Myeloid Leukemia Harboring Isocitrate Dehydrogenase 2 Mutation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute myeloid leukaemia ( AML ) form cancer common old patient . Mutations isocitrate dehydrogenase enzyme 2 ( IDH2 ) find approximately 15 % patient AML . The outcome first line chemotherapy treatment poor many patient fail attain complete remission ( CR , ie refractory ) eventually relapse . There single standard care relapse refractory AML . Since prognosis poor great need new therapy . Inhibition IDH2 mutation may represent promise target therapy AML . AG-221 design block IDH2 mutation . Data ongoing first-in-human study show AG-221 generally well tolerate demonstrate CR patient IDH2 mutation positive relapse refractory AML . The study purpose test safety efficacy AG-221 compare conventional care regimen ( CCR ) , include best supportive care ( BSC ) , azacitidine plus BSC , low-dose cytarabine plus BSC intermediate-dose cytarabine plus BSC , patient late stage AML refractory relapse second third line therapy positive IDH2 mutation . Patients randomly assign receive open-label tablet AG-221 one CCR continuous 28-day treatment cycle . The trial duration expect 28 month include 24 month enrollment , approximately 4 month treatment follow-up period . Study procedures include : vital sign , physical exam , ECGs , ECHO , urine/blood sample , bone marrow aspirate and/or biopsy peripheral blood test IDH2 ass treatment response . Bone marrow , blood , cheek swab sample use genetic test . This study sponsor Celgene Corporation . Approximately 280 participant take part study .</detailed_description>
