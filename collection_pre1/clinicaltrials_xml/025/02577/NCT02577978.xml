	<brief_title>Stability Medial Pivot Total Knee Prosthesis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several different prosthesis available use total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) . These design aim replicate normal kinematics knee joint maintaining stability throughout full range motion . The posterior cruciate ligament ( PCL ) contribute function native knee , preserve function similarly prosthetic knee . Prostheses PCL sacrifice , function replace mean , poor outcome . However , various problem preserve PCL , include PCL deterioration arthritic knee difficulty proper tensioning , lead development alternative way emulate normal femoral rollback sagittal plane stability . These posterior-substituted ( PS ) design substitute PCL either cam post mechanism symmetrical ultra-congruent tibial insert . The cruciate-retaining ( CR ) PS design , together advance surgical technique component material , achieve excellent implant survivorship rate &gt; 90 % 20 year . Reports functional outcome , however , variable . One potential area improvement TKA optimization implant design well approximate native knee kinematics . In normal knee , medial condyle remain stable sagittal plane , function like ball-and-socket , whereas lateral condyle translate anterior posterior flexion . The designs CR PS knee allow medial-centered rotation . Analysis reveal paradoxical anterior slide femur flexion , abnormal axial rotation , condylar lift-off . Edge load increase sagittal plane motion may predispose accelerated polyethylene wear . The posterior stabilized design use cam-and-post mechanism one piece prosthesis plastic post fit slot piece prosthesis . A new design attempt address issue medial pivot knee ( MP ) . This design characterize asymmetrical tibial insert medial compartment ultra-congruent , provide antero-posterior stability lateral compartment allow rollback around medial axis rotation i.e use ball-and-socket mechanism . This design accurately recreate normal knee kinematics , reduces anteroposterior instability , avoids condylar lift-off . Early study indicate improve polyethylene wear characteristic . Midterm study report excellent implant survivorship clinical outcome . Several randomized trial compare MP knee favorably design . Patients bilateral TKAs different prosthesis side prefer medial pivot knee PS , CR , mobile-bearing ( MB ) design . A trial compare MP PS design find great range motion ( ROM ) well patient-reported outcome MP group 2 year . There also exist literature report poor outcome MP design . A trial involve 96 patient receive MP knee MB knee contralateral side find low ROM , high complication rate , bad patient report outcome MP knee . Given lack consensus literature , investigation warrant determine impact MP design outcomes follow TKA .</detailed_description>
