	<brief_summary>Blepharospasm hemifacial spasm debilitate condition significantly impact patient quality life . Cyclical treatment botulinum toxin injection offer temporary relief duration treatment efficacy variable . The standard model patient care define routine fixed- time base schedule treatment cycle may lead unnecessarily frequent treatment patient experience distress symptom others symptoms return schedule follow period . The present study aim compare patient-initiated model care , patient determine treatment timing , standard model care use two-arm randomise controlled trial design . It expect patient able initiate treatment experience less variation disease severity disability treatment cycle empower take initiative feel need treatment . A range outcome assess include : confidence satisfaction service , depression , anxiety , quality life , illness treatment belief . If patient-led care model show effective preventing distress reduce disability population ; find acceptable service user , significant implication service organisation across NHS .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Blepharospasm dystonia describe sustain , force , involuntary closure eyelid , cause muscle contraction . Hemifacial spasm occur one side face result complete closure one eye , spasms across cheek , face neck . Hemifacial spasm , name implies , unilateral , whereas blepharospasm always affect eye . Blepharospasm hemifacial spasm debilitate condition , carry risk functional blindness lead appearance concern , social embarrassment isolation , depression poor quality life . [ 1-3 ] Botulinum toxin treatment use standard care stop spasm , result fluctuate pattern relief aggravation [ 4 ] hence patient return repeat injection . A recent systematic review indicate patient report benefit botulinum toxin blepharospasm range improvement 96 % patient report significant relief symptom . [ 5 ] Evidence duration benefit provide repeat treatment also markedly inconsistant . [ 5 ] Although definition benefit differ study review , research explain inconsistency . Despite standardised treatment regimen , injection average 3 time year , currently use across patient Moorfields Eye Hospital typical throughout UK . This may mean people leave experience debilitate symptom next scheduled appointment see often , hence alternative model care need consider . Patient-centred care forefront NHS , [ 6 ; 7 ] reflect shift away paternalistic model healthcare . Patients encourage take active role know manage health , especially important condition dystonia reality living condition demand . As result patient-led healthcare service become increasingly common potential address inconsistency find current botulinum toxin treatment regimen . Research study trialling patient-initiated service , patient rather healthcare professional initiate treatment care , show promise . These service provide patient information access service , rather regular schedule appointment . A systematic review conduct Whear et al [ 8 ] synthesise evidence model care across three condition : irritable bowel disease , breast cancer rheumatoid arthritis . Overall , difference psychological health-related quality life initiate outpatient follow-up appointment compare standard care , despite many case patient less contact healthcare professional . Patient clinician satisfaction also significantly great patient-initiated service compare regular appointment scheduling . Since systematic review member research team lead development evaluation patient-initiated follow-up service patient arthritis . Using mixed method study design service find reduce healthcare utilisation RCT , without compromise clinical psychosocial well-being , find acceptable patient embed qualitative study . [ 9 ] Adopting patient-led model care could reduce discomfort disability patient short-term response botulinum toxin reduce unnecessary hospital visit treatment patient longer-term response . There currently one patient-initiated , nurse-led botulinum toxin clinic run UK patient blepharospasm hemifacial spasm , [ 10 ] yet evaluate comparison usual care . Due variable nature treatment response blepharospasm hemifacial spasm appropriate condition evaluate service nature . This study therefore , provide unique opportunity empower patient dystonia take control treatment optimise effect botulinum toxin , allow seek treatment feel necessary rather dictated clinical team , within context methodologically robust evaluative .</detailed_description>
