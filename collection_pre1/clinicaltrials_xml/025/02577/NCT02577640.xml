	<detailed_description>Management pancreatic disorder imparts major burden healthcare cost , estimate 3 billion dollar annually . Chronic pancreatitis characterize chronic inflammation progressive scarring , lead abdominal pain , irreversible damage pancreas loss exocrine endocrine function . Additionally , chronic pancreatic inflammation risk factor pancreas cancer . There current treatment modify natural history disorder . Thus , identify novel therapeutic option disease represent high priority , could fill unmet medical need improve quality life , reduce risk malignant transformation , limit exorbitant medical cost associate patient care . The investigator assemble multi-disciplinary research team pursue alternative , non-pharmacologic approach limit inflammatory cascade ( Chronic Pancreatitis ) CP patient . They assess compliance , toxicity measure change pro-inflammatory cytokine expression soy base dietary bread product use classic 3+3 dose escalation study design subject chronic pancreatitis .</detailed_description>
