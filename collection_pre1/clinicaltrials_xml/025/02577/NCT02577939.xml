	<brief_summary>The primary objective study demonstrate efficacy pre-transplant , interval exercise training ( IET ) intervention , increase peak oxygen uptake ( VO2peak ) score cycle ergometry . This study lead-in phase ensure IET feasible population . Secondary objective include document safety IET population , evaluate correlation VO2peak method measure pre-transplant cardiorespiratory performance , compare 6 minute walk distance ( 6MWD ) pre post IET , establish feasibility 6MWD perform unsupervised health care professional . Eligible patient include 40 evaluable autologous ( n=20 ) allogeneic ( n=20 ; 10 full intensity 10 reduced intensity ) transplant patient deem appropriate exercise intervention treat physician . The investigator enroll 50 patient onto trial . Results study inform randomize , multi-site study pre-transplant exercise intervention .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Cardiorespiratory Performance After Interval Exercise Training Prior Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary purpose study determine ability pre-transplant exercise intervention improve cardiorespiratory performance ( measure VO2peak ) . If safety approach document , efficacy demonstrate , foundation laid large , randomize , multi-center study formally determine benefit pre-transplant exercise intervention . We plan analyze effect IET VO2peak auto allo group separately give different course treatment outcome . Study subject recruit transplant team decide undergo HCT . Following recruitment , patient undergo baseline fitness assessment receive individualize IET prescription duration 6 week prior stem cell mobilization ( auto ) prior hospitalization conditioning ( allo ) . For first two week , subject undergo three time weekly 3 minute interval train walk 60-70 % MHR . This follow three time weekly aerobic interval train 5 three-minute bout 65-85 % maximum heart rate per session 4 week . All patient also provide FitBit accelerometer . Prior transplant , patient undergo follow-up fitness assessment . All patient undergo activity track accelerometry ( FitBit ) admission/weekly symptom/HRQOL track electronic survey throughout post-transplant hospitalization . Also hospitalization , patient perform weekly clinician supervise 6MWD test inpatient . One weekly test hospitalization include patient self-administered ( clinician observe ) 6MWD , along clinician supervise 6MWD . Unsupervised patient perform 6MWD consider feasible patient perform 6MWD safely , 80 % patient , patient-performed 6MWD value within 10 % correspond clinician supervise 6MWD result . If feasibility meet , ask patient perform 6MWD weekly 4 week post discharge record distance .</detailed_description>
