	<brief_title>Diabetic Foot Ulcer Study Topical Interventions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patient flow The target subject screen orthopedic department two regional hospital one general outpatient clinic ( GOPD ) . Those eligible potential subject recruit discharge hospital accord selection criterion . All subject refer intervened orthopedic nurse clinic regional hospital . The subject randomize three group fix block 10 online software . A sequence assignment generate put seal envelope research assistant . The investigator involve randomization process allocation sequence . The subject enrol allocated different treatment arm accord allocation sequence . Data collection Outcome assessor blind employ study . A research assistant responsible measuring wound size take clinical photo . In every clinical visit , research assistant wait outside clinic removal proper cleanse wound first author unaware topical treatment option . The subject would discontinue follow wound completely heal till end 12-week study period . Intervention All participant attend nurse clinic follow-up first author ( nurse consultant ) weekly first four week biweekly till 12 week follow period . They nine clinical attendance totally . At visit , sharp debridement non-viable tissue stimulation vascularity avascular tissue perform need first author . Then , apply topical dress accord randomization sequence . Statistical analysis All analysis carry accord intention-to-treat principle . SPSS Statistics Mac version 22 ( SPSS Inc , Chicago , Illinois ) use data analysis . Comparison would make among group Fisher 's exact test nominal data Kruskal-Wallis test ordinal scale data . The complete ulcer heal compare among group Kaplan-Meier estimate . General estimate equation ( GEE ) use compare ulcer size reduction rate , wound fluid concentration matrix metalloproteinase -9 ( MMP9 ) , tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-α ) interleukin-1 alpha ( IL-1α ) among group . Statistical significance set p &lt; 0.05 test . Sample size calculation - The probability non-healing ( p1 ) nanocrystalline silver ( nAg ) group = 0.20 - The probability ( p2 ) non-healing manuka honey ( MH ) /conventional group = 0.50 - The alpha ( α ) value 0.05 power ( 1-β ) 0.8 - Ratio sample size per group 1:1 - Therefore , total sample subject 2 group 77 . Each group need 39 subject . For 3 group , total number subject 117 . - From experience , 10 % patient loss follow . The actual number subject need 129. i.e . 43 subject per group . Data quality assurance In order ensure data quality , research assistant assign verify source document trial record accurate , complete , keep up-to-date maintain . The student investigator train research assistant data quality assurance process . The student investigator also check data entry sheet raw data every month . The responsibility research assistant list follow . - Check accuracy completeness case screen form consent form . - Verify laboratory data case record form ( CRF ) consistent correspond laboratory result . - Verify inter-current illness report CRF . - Verify withdrawal dropout enrol subject trial report explained CRF . If miss data data inconsistency , research assistant clarify data internal electronic record hospital . Handling miss data The nature study multiple observation subject regular censor point . Thus , miss clinical data handle last observation carry forward . For laboratory data , statistical method general estimate equation use analysis repeat measure among group . The miss data miss completely random ( MCAR ) assumption . Therefore , laboratory miss data need make estimation present study .</detailed_description>
