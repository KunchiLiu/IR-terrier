	<brief_title>CAN-Stim Compared PTNS Treatment Urinary Urgency Incontinence With Wireless Neuromodulation Technology</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CAN-Stim subject implant unilaterally ( implantation side investigator discretion ) . Subjects educate use transmitter programmer . Therapy deliver minimum 8 hour per day 12 week . Subjects consider responder 13-week follow-up , continue therapy follow total 12 month . Non-responders offer explant device exit study . ( Subjects less 50 % improvement may choose keep device even though may eligible continue study . PTNS subject receive in-office PTNS therapy use Uroplasty device . Unilateral percutaneous stimulation perform standard fashion total 12 week . Primary objective measure 13-week follow-up . At point study participant receive in-office PTNS therapy may choose receive CAN-Stim device least 8 week last PTNS session . Otherwise , may exit trial manage standard care . If choose CAN-Stim device , subject implant unilaterally ( implantation side investigator discretion ) . The subject educate use transmitter programmer .
