	<brief_summary>The primary objective study show ventilation heterogeneity identify hyperpolarized helium-3 lung MRI prevalent child poorly control asthma despite guidelines-based treatment ICS . The secondary objective demonstrate whether eight week treatment extra-fine particle ICS ( HFA-BDP ) improve ventilation heterogeneity compare treatment coarse particle ICS ( fluticasone HFA dry powder ) .</brief_summary>
