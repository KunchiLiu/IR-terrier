	<detailed_description>Physicians charge HIV-infected patient increasingly face previously unrecognized comorbid condition atherosclerosis cardiovascular event , loss renal function , osteopenia/osteoporosis bone fracture non-AIDS-defining cancer ( 1-4 ) . The incidence condition seem high general population controversial data disease appear young age HIV-infected patient . Different pathogenic mechanism involve increased risk comorbidities . First , increase life expectancy HIV-infected population . The number elderly HIV+ individual dramatically increase , nowadays , approximately one-half people live HIV United States age 50 older ( 5 ) . In sense , age condition associate chronic inflammation immune senescence , contribute accelerate age-related morbidity . Second , persistent inflammatory state activation immune system also induce HIV-infection , per se . This condition amplify risk age-related morbidity ( 6-9 ) . Finally , antiretroviral-related toxicity contribute accelerate apparition disease dyslipidemia cardiovascular event ( mainly associate protease inhibitor use ) , renal damage low bone mineral density ( especially tenofovir probably also protease inhibitor ) . As consequence , one current aim HIV management management chronic non-infectious co-morbidities increasingly older complex population . The use new safety antiretroviral drug mandatory strategy , especially elderly population , achieve maintain viral suppression . However , many publish study show high level inflammation even patient viral suppression , comparison general population . Regarding condition , investigator currently lack effective intervention potently block inflammatory status . Although initial data publish regard , data elderly HIV-infected people lack . Based data , investigator propose strategy treatment elderly HIV-infected patient double impact systemic inflammation age-related co-morbidities switch protease inhibitor raltegravir , integrase inhibitor neutral effect lipid bone metabolism , add statin anti-inflammatory effect . For safety reason , patient maintain viral suppression ( document indetectable viral load 1 year ) , history virological failure integrase inhibitor suspect documented resistance mutation integrase retrotranscriptase candidate study . Raltegravir antiretroviral drug receive approval U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) 2007 . It first new class HIV drug , integrase inhibitor , exhibit rapid , potent durable antiretroviral activity antiretroviral naïve patient treatment-experienced patient drug-resistant HIV-1 ( 10-12 ) . Raltegravir demonstrate neutral effect lipid renal parameter , good impact bone mineral density ( 13 ) lipid profile protease inhibitor ( 14 ) . Statins lipid-lowering drug also exert anti-inflammatory effect , immune-modulatory property . Recent study HIV-infected population suggest statin anti-inflammatory effect , evaluate inflammatory marker ( 15-21 ) , statin use associate low risk non-AIDS define morbidity malignancy mortality ( 22-25 ) . But limited data publish , mainly base retrospective study , clinical recommendation available . The investigator propose use atorvastatin study anti-inflammatory effect measuring change inflammatory marker clinical condition . Atorvastatin choose due low drug-drug interaction statin ritonavir low cost . Since data available effect statins inflammatory marker clinical condition , intermediate dose ( 20 mg per day ) select . IL-6 D-dimer biomarkers strongly predict mortality treat HIV infection sCD14 , sCD163 soluble marker monocyte activation reflect key source inflammation coagulation HIV infection predict mortality ( 26,27 ) . For reason , marker choose determine change introduction statin change antiretrovirals .</detailed_description>
