	<brief_summary>Background The sensation outside portion thigh provide nerve call lateral femoral cutaneous nerve ( LFCN ) . The investigator inject freeze around nerve reduce feel around thigh ( i.e . anesthesia ) . Anesthesia , freezing , lateral femoral cutaneous nerve reduce pain patient A ) hip knee surgery [ 1,2 ] , B ) removal skin graft [ 3 ] , C ) wound care . In addition , damage LFCN ( i.e . Meralgia Paresthetica ) associate body armour gun belt use military police personnel [ 4 ] . Although generally benign condition , compression injury nerve painful require treatment . In addition , actual variability sensory distribution nerve elucidate topographical fashion measure study . Finding efficient effective method anesthesia LFCN improve positively impact quality pain control patient . Ultrasound improve accuracy efficiency various regional anesthesia technique , could also impact safety . Therefore investigator hypothesize ultrasound guide lateral femoral cutaneous nerve block use subinguinal technique statistically efficacious efficient compare neurostimulation base blockade .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Purpose Study : The goal study compare ultrasound-guided subinguinal injection technique neurostimulation-guided injection technique lateral femoral cutaneous nerve block . The neurostimulation technique use electrical field stimulate nerve needle close proximity . One old study show well use landmark achieve anesthesia lateral femoral cutaneous nerve , study compare use ultrasound freeze nerve [ 7 ] . The primary outcome relative efficiency , i.e . total anesthesia-related time ( defined sum performance onset time ) . This look long take procedure ( needle insertion , medication injection ) , plus time take thigh go numb . Secondary outcome include relative success rate , procedural discomfort , number needle pass topographical sensory distribution nerve cohort patient . Methodology : Selection Human Subjects : With approval Defence Research &amp; Development Canada Human Research Ethics Committee ( HREC ) , total 27 volunteer recruit . Subjects recruit advertising within CF Health Services Centre Facility email notification CF member National Capital region DWAN . If insufficient volunteer , people volunteer , contact email inquire aware people maybe interested volunteer study finalize . If know anyone , ask forward initial email people , ask contact investigator wish information . Interested civilian volunteer Class `` A '' reservists approach cohort patient respond original communication email . Once patient submit name consideration , contact review whether meet inclusion/exclusion criterion . Data Analyses : investigator expect success rate similar group . However hypothesis performance time onset time could different . Therefore main outcome total anesthesia-related time ( sum performance onset time ) . According Shannon et al [ 7 ] , total anesthesia-related time neurostimulation technique 10.1 +/- 4.7 min ( performance time : 9.5 +/- 4.7 min onset time : 0.8 +/- 0.9 min ) . Using paired T-test compare technique , difference 30 % total anesthesia time would represent effect size 0.74 require total 17 subject undergoing bilateral block obtain 2-tailed α error 0.05 ß error 0.2 . Since onset total anesthesia-related time measure successful block since investigator expect success rate 85 % neurostimulation , investigator recruit 25 patient account reach postulated end point . Normality continuous data first assess Kolmogorov-Smirnov test . Continuous data analyze use pair T-test . For categorical data , Mann-Whitney U test Chi-square test use appropriate . Hypotheses tested 2-tailed . P &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant . Risks : Participation study voluntary volunteer withdraw consent time without effect access future medical care . There likely minor discomfort procedure similar freezing dental procedure blood drawn . Patients ask u stop procedure time . The chance minor discomfort day two injection occur manage counter acetaminophen ibuprofen . The investigator expect limitation daily activity . Furthermore , side effect associate lateral femoral cutaneous nerve block report likely rare . [ 8 ] . Confidentiality/Anonymity Patients ' confidentiality/anonymity protect two mechanism : - research subject identify serial number - access patient 's research data restrict primary investigator Approximate Time Involvement The approximate time commitment 1.5 hour . Roles Responsibilities Research Team Recruitment , study planning organization do Gaurav Gupta . Technical procedure , data collection manuscript preparation share task entire research team .</detailed_description>
