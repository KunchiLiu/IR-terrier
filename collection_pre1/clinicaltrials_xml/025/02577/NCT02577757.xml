	<detailed_description>Patients brain tumor include malignant glioma locate eloquent area long consider inoperable median survival predictable postoperative sequela . The improved prognosis chemoradiotherapy surgical resection complete possible questioned attitude . The goal operate patient without additional disability . The cortical electrostimulation intraoperative mapping awake surgery meet eloquent area . Identifying fMRI area well specify advance way initially shorten time awake exploratory surgery improve patient comfort . However anxiety induced review pre-operative setting , debutante aphasia often make problematic realization formal language test . The analysis low frequency spontaneous oscillation large neuronal network help isolate network language rest without particular language test group analysis . This methodology , however , need validate individual level apply pathology . Proceed analysis sensitivity specificity result fMRI language network obtain two way : provide conventional language test independent component analysis . These two method compare reference method cortical intraoperative mapping .</detailed_description>
