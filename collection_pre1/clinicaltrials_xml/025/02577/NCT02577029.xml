	<brief_title>Study ARC-520 With Without Other Drugs Used Treatment Chronic HBV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter , open-label study ARC-520 base treatment regimen administer patient HBeAg positive HBeAg negative immune active chronic Hepatitis B Virus ( HBV ) infection various genotype , patient Hepatitis D Virus ( HDV ) . Eligible patient naive previous treatment , sign Ethics Committee - approve informed consent , enrol receive ARC-520 alone ARC-520 plus additional treatment entecavir ( ENT ) tenofovir ( TDF ) and/or pegylated interferon alpha 2a ( PEG IFN ) therapy . The study may initially involve total 96 eligible chronic HBV HDV infect patient . Patients cohort receive total 13 dos ARC-520 2mg/kg 4 mg/kg . Patients undergo following evaluation regular interval study : medical history , physical examination , vital sign measurement ( blood pressure , heart rate , respiratory rate , temperature ) , weight , adverse event assessment ( AEs ) , 12-lead ECGs , liver fibrosis testing , concomitant medication assessment , blood sample collection hematology , coagulation , chemistry , exploratory Pharmacodynamic ( PD ) measure , urinalysis , HBV serology , cytokine , Follicle Stimulating Hormone ( FSH ) test ( post-menopausal female ) pregnancy test female childbearing potential . Clinically significant change include AEs follow resolution , condition stabilizes , event otherwise explain , patient lose follow-up . For patient , duration study approximately 96 week , enrolment last visit . Prior enrolment 60 day screen period .
