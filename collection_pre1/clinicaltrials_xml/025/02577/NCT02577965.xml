	<brief_summary>Recent study suggest important gender difference pathophysiology prognosis ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) . This first prospective control study ass gender difference mechanism plaque rupture/erosion thrombus formation patient present STEMI treat primary angioplasty . Gender-related mechanism plaque rupture erosion investigate use combination Quantitative Coronary Angiography ( QCA ) , high resolution Optical Coherence Tomography ( OCT ) culprit vessel histopathology analyse thrombus aspirate infarct related lesion , perform independent core laboratory , blind group ( male female ) clinical variable . In OCTAVIA ; enrollment 1:1 ratio accord gender group ensure computer-assisted matching algorithm gender age ( &lt; 50 , 51-70 , &gt; 70 year ) . Matching purpose enable enrollment even number male female patient balance age group . This type dynamic algorithm appropriate composition referral population know advance . The sample size OCTAVIA study calculate basis per patient stent strut coverage ( continuous variable right skew distribution ) mean 97.0 % standard deviation 4.0 % men , versus mean 95.0 % standard deviation 4.0 % woman , follow XIENCE PRIMEâ„¢ Everolimus Eluting Coronary Stent System implantation . Thus , aim 5 % 2-tailed superiority alpha , 80 % power , assume 1:1 enrollment accord gender , total 64 patient per group enrol . Anticipating 10 % dropout rate due patient lose follow-up inadequate imaging ( included major side branch section ) , total enrollment set 70 patient per group ( total population 140 subject ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A suboptimal degree attention focus detection management coronary artery disease ( CAD ) woman recently . Although many woman perceive heart disease significant health risk , CAD lead cause mortality woman develop nation , mortality primarily drive acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) cardiogenic shock ( American Heart Association 2005 Heart Disease Stroke Statistics ) . In recent year , literature article regard various aspect heart disease woman significantly increase . These report highlight important sex difference pathophysiology , presentation , treatment ischemic heart disease denounce pervasive sex-related disparity referral treatment heart disease major reason outcome difference sexes . Such activity useful drive attention heart disease woman , area largely ignored scientific community public 20 year ago . However , must recognize date , limited data substantiate many statement ; recognition important guide future research effort . A careful look recently publish literature reveals modest advancement toward clarify gender-based difference pathophysiology ischemic heart disease gender-based difference outcome . At time , key question concern strategy prevention treatment heart disease woman remain unanswered , cardiovascular clinical trial continue include few woman men . A fundamental question whether mechanism underlie ischemic heart disease woman differ men . This important question pathophysiology differs woman , difference inform strategy prevention , detection , treatment would effective woman . A number indicator point different mechanism man woman . 1 . More symptom , less diseased vessel . Despite symptoms physical limitation , woman less obstructive coronary heart disease men , assess angiography along entire spectrum acute coronary syndrome . Chest pain without apparently severe obstructive coronary artery disease ( CAD ) distinctly common woman men . 2 . Disability unrelated severity coronary obstruction . Among woman , chest pain symptom disability correlate severity coronary stenosis , assess angiography . 3 . Higher risk infarction despite less cardiac damage . Women , particularly young middle-aged ( one would expect advantaged coronary disease risk compare men due estrogen protective action ) , show high rate adverse outcomes acute myocardial infarction ( MI ) men similar age , despite less severe coronary narrowing , small infarct , preserve systolic function . Consequently , identification less obstructive atheroma put forth potentially helpful strategy risk stratification woman . Although compel theory , date little evidence suggest vascular abnormality absence obstructive atheroma detect angiography commonly implicate pathogenesis ischemia among woman men . Recent study evaluate gender difference coronary structure function use intravascular ultrasound type vascular testing . These study find woman less atheroma volume men , include luminal plaque atheroma within medium , despite old age risk factor , even account body surface area vessel size . After adjust body size , woman also small coronary vessel . However , study unable identify vascular abnormality , like plaque characteristic , might explain gender difference clinical presentation . Presently , far able conclude , even suggest , hypothesize abnormality play large etiologic prognostic role ischemic heart disease among woman among men . A general pattern high mortality complication rate woman acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) compare men describe many year . It important recognize , however , gender difference mortality ACS occur across board specific patient subgroup . It hypothesize difference MI type ( STEMI versus type ) may due pathophysiology underlie event . For example , acute occlusion cause thrombus superimpose rupture erode atherosclerotic plaque believe play large role trans mural infarction type ACS . Thus , possible gender difference vessel size collateralization put woman great risk men STEMI type ACS . It also unclear gender difference outcome MI see young middle-aged patient old patient . One would expect woman young 50 year age , majority premenopausal , advantage rather less advantaged compare men similar age term survival . On hand , coronary disease occur young woman , must aggressive , driven multiple risk factor , cause secondary unknown cause . A less aggressive clinical treatment woman coronary heart disease relative men document year , tendency refer gender bias health care delivery . A 2005 Statement American Heart Association review gender-specific data safety efficacy percutaneous coronary intervention pharmacotherapy . Despite fact woman men die cardiovascular disease United States , despite establish benefit Percutaneous Coronary Intervention ( PCI ) reduce fatal nonfatal ischemic complication patient acute myocardial infarction , estimate 33 % annual PCIs perform woman . In addition , woman experience great delay intervention refer diagnostic catheterization less frequently men . Recent advance angioplasty equipment technique improve option patient small coronary peripheral ( access ) artery . In addition , increase use stent adjunctive pharmacotherapy improve outcome woman men . Nevertheless , woman continue represent 15 % 38 % population study PCI , still relatively gender- race-specific data exist . According American Heart Association , well understanding elimination apparent treatment disparity priority . One area interest refine treatment pathways strategy woman STEMI , mortality rate bleed risk remain high men . To optimize clinical outcome woman undergo PCI , evidence-based evaluation randomize clinical trial must emphasize increased recruitment woman , mandate include gender-specific , ethnic , racial gender-based result . Cardiovascular Optical Coherence Tomography ( OCT ) innovative catheter-based image technology utilizes light rather ultrasound obtain unique detail vessel microscopic scale . OCT provide high-resolution ( 10 15 micron axial ) , full tomographic vivo image measurement coronary artery deploy stent high level accuracy . ( 8,9 ) Applications technique include diagnostic assessment coronary atherosclerosis guidance coronary intervention . After least decade renew interest woman 's cardiovascular health , leave question answer . Fundamental question pathophysiology ischemic heart disease woman remain unanswered . We gain clue basis gender difference coronary heart disease unique female vascular system . As result , yet unable explain gender difference epidemiology , presentation , treatment outcome coronary heart disease . Key question remain woman protect cardiovascular disease , protection restrict coronary system , protection end woman diabetes acute MI . We lack study compare biological mechanism disease woman men good define vascular process unique woman . We lack sufficiently large follow-up study link process cardiac end point . How increase inclusion woman cardiovascular clinical trial ? Without answer question , little do improve prevention treatment coronary heart disease woman . In STEMI patient , acute coronary occlusion cause thrombus superimpose rupture eroded plaque play important role . Nevertheless , evidence available concern mechanism plaque rupture , underlie vascular abnormality infarct related vessel biological response vascular remodel repair , unique woman . In OCTAVIA trial , gender-related mechanism plaque rupture investigate use combination Quantitative Coronary Angiography ( QCA ) , OCT histopathology analysis thrombus aspirate culprit lesion perform independent core laboratory , blind group assignment . By combine clinical variable QCA , OCT thrombus analysis , possible obtain critical information concern relationship serological biomarker cardiac damage , clinical prognostic correlate coronary plaque morphology underlie mechanism coronary thrombosis woman . In addition assess gender difference mechanism plaque rupture , OCTAVIA also evaluate change vascular territory remote infarct relate lesion , local vascular response primary angioplasty intervention correlation clinical outcome one year follow-up . These data important support gender base differential strategy substantial impact improvement clinical practice treatment woman STEMI .</detailed_description>
