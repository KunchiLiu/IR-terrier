	<detailed_description>Obesity modifiable risk factor knee osteoarthritis ( OA ) , weight loss effective non-pharmacologic treatment reduce pain . Recently , investigator determine ideal , highly controlled circumstance , diet-induced weight loss 10 % combine exercise significantly well reduce pain either intervention alone . Compared investigator previous longterm weight loss exercise trial knee OA , diet-induced weight loss exercise group twice effective relieve pain . Whether investigator result generalize less rigorously monitor patient cohort unknown . Thus challenge investigator face provide practical mean implement proven treatment community set . This study aim develop demonstrate effectiveness systematic , practical , cost-effective diet-induced weight loss exercise intervention urban rural community reduce pain improve clinical outcome knee OA patient . This pragmatic community-based trial determine investigator previous finding translate real-world setting address common concern barrier effectiveness/ implementation . Participants 820 ambulatory , community-dwelling , overweight obesemen woman meet American College Rheumatology clinical criterion knee OA . The primary aim determine whether pragmatic , community-based 18-month diet-induced weight loss exercise intervention implement three North Carolina county diverse residential ( urban rural ) socioeconomic composition significantly decrease knee pain overweight obese adult knee OA relative attention control group . Secondary aim determine whether intervention improve self-reported function , health-related quality life , mobility . The investigator also establish cost-effectiveness pragmatic , community-based , multimodal diet-induced weight-loss exercise program conduct cost-effectiveness budgetary impact analyse use data current trial validate computer-simulated model knee OA . Many physician treat people knee OA practical mean implement weight loss exercise treatment . This study significant test effectiveness long-awaited much need community-based program serve blueprint clinicians public health official urban rural community implement weight loss exercise program design reduce knee pain improve clinical outcome overweight obese people knee OA sustain long-term reasonable cost .</detailed_description>
