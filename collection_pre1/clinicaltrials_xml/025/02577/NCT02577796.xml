	<brief_summary>Radial artery access increasingly become popular among interventional cardiologist patient undergo percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) / diagnostic angiography secondary low complication rate . However , frequently associate spasm radial artery lead difficulty catheter manipulation procedure potentially leading vessel trauma . This vessel trauma cause activation coagulation system formation clot subsequently occlusion radial artery . In study investigator intend find association radial artery spasm future development radial artery occlusion patient undergo PCI via radial access .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Transradial ( TR ) approach PCI gain widespread popularity secondary decrease bleeding reduce vascular access site complication compare transfemoral ( TF ) access . Other advantage TR technique include improve patient satisfaction , decrease length stay enhance economic outlook . Radial artery spasm ( RAS ) well-known obstacle associate transradial approach also common cause procedural failure . The reported incidence RAS vary 5 % - 30 % . Predictors spasm include young age , female gender , diabetes , small wrist circumference low body weight . With advent new technique small sheath size , hydrophilic coat sheath use vasodilator drug procedure incidence RAS reduce significantly still continue cumbersome problem . The marked muscle mass radial artery wall , great artery , high density alpha-adrenergic receptor explain propensity go spasm . This spasm produce pain difficulty catheter manipulation thereby increase chance complication arterial avulsion . It 's hypothesize might vascular endothelial damage catheter manipulation patient RAS activate coagulation cascade result radial artery occlusion . Radial artery occlusion ( RAO ) frequent complication radial artery cannulation . In perioperative period , rate RAO report high 30 % -40 % . Postoperatively , however rate RAO drop low 3 % -10 % . Spontaneous recanalization radial artery occur frequently , consequently , prevalence persistent RAO much low post-operatively . Radial artery occlusion document abnormal Barbeau 's test , visible obstruction two-dimensional ultrasound absence Doppler flow signal distal puncture site . Radial artery occlusion usually clinically quiescent n't require intervention secondary dual blood supply arm . The presence RAO , however , make repeat ipsilateral radial access difficult . Predictors RAO include low body weight , advanced age , female gender , degree systemic anticoagulation , hemostasis process well low radial artery diameter sheath size ratio . The mechanism development RAO suppose thrombus formation follow vessel injury , intimal hyperplasia negative remodel vessel stretch radial artery undergoes cannulation . Development RAO related severity lesion suffer artery procedure thus , radial spasm supposedly occur secondary vessel trauma may associate subsequent occlusion radial artery . There one study date Ruiz-Salmer√≥n et al look association RAS development RAO . They find significant difference radial artery occlusion rate patient experience radial artery spasm . The major limitation study however assessment radial artery patency plethysmography pulse oximetry could underestimate true incidence RAO . However , study investigator intend use Doppler ultrasound ( gold standard ) detect patency radial artery able estimate true incidence RAO patient experience RAS procedure .</detailed_description>
