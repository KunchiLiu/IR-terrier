	<brief_summary>The purpose pilot study evaluate feasibility prophylactic administration Factor VIII Inhibitor Bypass Activity ( FEIBA ) termination cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) period . Specifically , propose study design demonstrate potential role FEIBA administration reduce need allogeneic transfusion treat refractory coagulopathy high risk patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Factor eight inhibitor bypassing activity ( FEIBA ) currently approve use country treatment patient Hemophilia inhibitor dose 50-100 units/kg . There large body evidence demonstrate safety efficacy FEIBA Hemophilia patient inhibitor theoretical advantage compare current blood product transfusion method , replenishes multiple deplete factor lose prolonged exposure CPB . This pilot study single center , randomize , double-blinded , placebo control trial assess feasibility safety factor eight inhibitor bypass activity ( FEIBA ) patient undergo major cardiovascular surgery require prolong CPB . The study population consist adult patient undergo elective cardiac surgery OHSU . Twelve participant randomly assign receive FEIBA placebo surgical procedure . Patients follow review adverse event ICU , four week discharge .</detailed_description>
