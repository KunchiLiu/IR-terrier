	<brief_title>Dose Escalation Study HBI-8000 Combination With Paclitaxel Trastuzumab Women With Advanced Metastatic HER2+ Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase I multi-center dose escalation study histone deacetylase inhibitor ( HDACi ) HBI-8000 give combination paclitaxel trastuzumab woman advance metastatic HER2+ breast cancer . Three dose level HBI-8000 ( 15 mg , 20 mg , 25 mg ) test use standard 3+3 escalation plan expand cohort maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) enroll minimum 10 patient evaluable safety fulfill requirement move combination forward I-SPY 2 trial . To consider evaluable safety , patient must receive least 75 % prescribed regimen per cycle 4 consecutive cycle cycle therapy define 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients progress 9 week evaluation later complete 4 cycle experience Grade ≤ 1 toxicity ( exclude alopecia ) also consider evaluable safety . Enrolled patient remain assigned dose level unacceptable toxicity disease progression occur . During dose escalation phase , 34 % evaluable patient dose level experience dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) , dose level consider exceeded MTD . Once MTD identify dose escalation phase , MTD dose level expand expansion phase enroll additional patient ensure least 10 patient evaluable safety MTD . Paclitaxel trastuzumab administer intravenous ( IV ) infusion day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 28-day cycle . HBI-8000 take mouth twice weekly assign dose day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 , 15 , 18 , 22 25 28-day cycle . Treatment continue disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , patient refusal/non-compliance observe . The study evaluate safety tolerability oral HBI-8000 bi-weekly combination weekly paclitaxel trastuzumab successful , determine optimal dose move phase II test combination I-SPY 2 trial neo-adjuvant breast cancer population . To determine MTD HBI-8000 twice weekly combination weekly paclitaxel trastuzumab woman HER2+ breast cancer . - To determine adverse event rate twice weekly HBI-8000 combination weekly paclitaxel trastuzumab - To determine tolerability twice weekly HBI-8000 administered weekly paclitaxel trastuzumab - To explore efficacy twice weekly HBI-8000 combination weekly paclitaxel trastuzumab - To obtain pharmacokinetics twice weekly HBI-8000 administer combination weekly paclitaxel trastuzumab . - To determine on-target effect HBI-8000 measuring protein acetylation - To explore treatment effect immune cell blood and/or tumor tissue appropriate Enrolled patient take HBI-8000 assign dose twice weekly receive weekly paclitaxel trastuzumab minimum 8 week ( 2 treatment cycle ) . On day paclitaxel infusion , HBI-8000 take least one hour paclitaxel infusion . HBI-8000 take within 30 minute meal . The interval HBI-8000 administration 3-4 day absence dose delay interruption due adverse event . For example , three day elapse 1st 2nd dose HBI-8000 week , Monday/Thursday ; Tuesday/Friday . A disease re-evaluation schedule every 8 week . Based Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors 1.1 ( RECIST1.1 ) , response treatment determine . Patients stable disease ( SD ) , partial response ( PR ) complete response ( CR ) may continue treatment disease progression , unacceptable side effect , patient refusal/non-compliance occurs . Patients monitor clinic every 4 week receive study treatment . The end treatment ( EOT ) visit occur 4 week last dose HBI-8000 , start new anti-cancer therapy , whichever early . At EOT , patient evaluate resolution treatment related toxicity . Toxicity related HBI-8000 , yet resolve Grade ≤ 1 , follow resolution Grade ≤ 1 consider chronic . All patient follow 1 year study enrollment best objective response , duration response , time PD , survival .</detailed_description>
