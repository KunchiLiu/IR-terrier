	<brief_summary>This pilot phase I trial study side effect best dose histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) inhibitor AR-42 ( AR-42 ) give together pomalidomide treat patient multiple myeloma return period improvement . HDAC inhibitor AR-42 may work stop cancer growth block enzyme need cell growth . Pomalidomide drug use chemotherapy work stop growth cancer cell cause die . Giving HDAC inhibitor AR-42 together pomalidomide may cause patient respond well treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>HDAC Inhibitor AR-42 Pomalidomide Treating Patients With Relapsed Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose , safety efficacy AR-42 combination pomalidomide relapse multiple myeloma ( MM ) patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine time progression ( TTP ) . II . To determine overall survival ( OS ) . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study HDAC inhibitor AR-42 pomalidomide . Patients receive pomalidomide orally ( PO ) daily day 1-21 , dexamethasone PO twice weekly ( BIW ) thrice weekly ( TIW ) week 1-3 , HDAC inhibitor AR-42 PO BIW TIW week 1-3 . Courses repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow least 30 day .</detailed_description>
