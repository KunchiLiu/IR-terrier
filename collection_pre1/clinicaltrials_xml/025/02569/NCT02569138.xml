	<detailed_description>The purpose study investigate long term balance-enhancing effect insoles hard thin old adult . Thirty old female adult age 65-84 year recruit study . Those define healthy old adult per initial screening questionnaire ask complete additional screening test schedule test session include sensory testing , balance testing , cognitive test use monofilaments , Berg Balance Scale , Montreal Cognitive Assessment tool , respectively . Participants also examine degree hallux valgus use Manchester Scale , since moderate severe hallux valgus display balance deficit old adult . Those participant complete test display acceptable age range score define test guideline randomly select either intervention group ( 20 participant ) control group ( 10 participant ) . All participant fit custom insole hard thin . These insole affect habitual ankle position habitual stance way . These insole design mechanically support foot within shoe , mostly provide much somatosensory feedback possible detected mechanoreceptors skin plantar sole foot . Participants intervention group require wear insole shoe full 12 week intervention . One pair participant 's shoe group choose primary investigator worn entire duration 12 week intervention least 8 hour per day . These shoe choose eligible within footwear assessment form previous footwear recommendation previous literature old adult . Each test session hold common room locate within close vicinity participant 's residence . A camcorder use record participant movement trial locate directly front participant . Foam marker fasten participant 's body use tape 7 location allow body movement analysis correspondence video record . Flat thin pressure sensor insole cause discomfort participant place shoe detect pressure force distribution foot . Once equipment set room participant , participant complete various task include quiet standing , one-legged stance , walk ramp unexpectedly terminate gait ( 10 second ) , perform cognitive task walk ramp ( 10 second ) , normal walking ( 10 second ) . Participants provide 12 postcard outline general question regard insole footwear comfort , hour wear , record fall . Participants require complete card twice week mail/return card Wilfrid Laurier University . The card pre-printed address front sticky tab seal card complete .</detailed_description>
