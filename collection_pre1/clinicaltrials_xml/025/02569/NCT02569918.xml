	<brief_summary>Phantom limb pain ( PLP ) frequent consequence amputation , notoriously difficult treat . Amputation usually follow traumatic injury surgery follow vascular disease , diabetes , osteomyelitis tumour case loss limb require survival patient . The loss limb body part usually follow sensation lose body part still present felt . These phenomenon call , respectively , phantom awareness phantom sensation . In 50-80 % amputee neuropathic pain develop lose limb also refer phantom limb pain ( PLP ) . PLP relate certain position movement phantom limb , might elicit worsened range physical factor ( e.g . change weather pressure residual limb ) psychological factor ( e.g . emotional stress ) . It well known treatment available PLP today , pharmacological , surgical , anaesthetic , psychological , ineffective . Today believe phantom limb pain may relate change cortex brain . There evidence change may modulate - even reverse - provide sensory input stump amputation zone . For example , cortical reorganization alleviation phantom limb pain observe amputee follow intense use hand prosthesis . However , consistent knowledge type peripheral sensory feedback may effective affect cortical plasticity best apply sensory feedback . The aim propose research create natural , meaningful sensation provide non-invasive sensory feedback ( i.e . surface electrical stimulation ) effectiveness alleviate phantom limb pain restore cortical neuroplastic change .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use Hand Prosthesis With Surface Electrical Stimulation Treatment Phantom Limb Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose experiment Up 50-80 % person amputation experience pain part body miss . This phenomenon call phantom limb pain . It clear today phantom limb pain occur , since pain difficult treat , affect quality life . Other scientific study show , use electrical stimulation apply surface electrode , assist decrease alleviate phantom limb pain . The aim study investigate surface electrical stimulation period 3 month decrease alleviate phantom limb pain . Methods Before study begin , necessary test participant tolerate electrical stimulation participant fulfill criterion participate study . During study , different electrical stimulation sequence apply . The participant ask fill series questionnaire , electrical stimulation , describe electrical stimulation experience , stimulation effect phantom limb pain phantom sensation . The participant also ask general mood investigate effect pain . The brain signal participant measure twice either surface electrode scan technique , participant think move amputated arm/hand , move healthy arm , receive electrical stimulation . Plan experiment The experiment take place period 3 month consist series measurement intervention session plan 2 phase ( intensive semi-intensive therapy ) . All session take place University Hospital Lausanne ( CHUV ) , Switzerland . Visit 0 . Interview meeting subject ( experiment begin , 1 session , 1-2 hour ) . Before experiment begin , participant invite meeting interview project responsible inform participant experiment . Visit 1 . Preliminary investigation ( experiment start , 1 session , maximum 3 hour pr session ) . Before experiment start , participant sign informed consent , investigator test participant tolerate electrical stimulation.The evoke sensory feedback sensation hand , characterize non-invasive , transcutaneous electrical stimulation peripheral nerve different location upper limb , stimulate single channel per time , several channel simultaneously . This session allow identify electrical stimulation optimal parameter ( amplitude , frequency pulse-width ) induce sensation hand modulate sensation , close natural pattern . A protocol integrate close-loop ( bidirectional control ) system artificial hand develop . If criteria participation fulfil , participation subject decide . Week 1 week 12 . Experiments superficial stimulation hand prosthesis control ( sEH ) perform three day per week 3 hour per day accord daily experiment aim compliance subject . The duration experiment 3 month . sEH divide two different phase : 1. intensive ( 1st 6th week ) ; period experiment carry three day per week ; 2. semi-intensive ( 7th 12th week ) ; period experiment carry one two consecutive day per week ; The stimulation protocol compose different program ( Exp ) : The program 1 ( Exp1 ) experiment perform order characterize best position parameter stimulation . The subject provide his/her feedback mean dedicated psychophysical platform specially design purpose . The program 2 ( Exp2 ) perform aim try different combination channel identify best pattern deliver natural useful sensation . After stimulus delivered different combination electrode , participant provide his/her feedback type , strength location sensation ( ) psychophysical test platform . sEH program ( Exp 3 ) The investigator test possibility drive stimulation produce electrical stimulator transform signal sensor ( ) robotic hand , voluntary control user . If everything work , investigator proceed therapeutic use robotic hand prosthesis . More specifically , ask participant perform several task ( depend capacity , availability motivation ) : ) execution different force level ii ) Identification object physical property iii ) Embodiment test ( ownership ) iv ) Functional improvement test ( activity daily live ) : Risks , side effect disadvantage Surface stimulation may cause muscle-contractions . Attachment surface electrode may cause skin become red irritated hour follow experiment . The type electrical stimulation use experiment associate known risk side effect . When sensory threshold determine ( i.e. , low strength electrical stimulation participant feel ) , may feel unpleasant painful short period time , unpleasantness pain disappear soon electrical stimulation stop . The electrical stimulation apply intervention period adjust painful . Measurement brain signal use functional magnetic resonance imaging technique ( fMRI ) safe , known risk side effect procedure . The participant may , however , find placed inside scanner unpleasant . Measurement brain signal surface electrode also consider safe , known risk side effect procedure . There may risk associated experiment unknown investigator . Therefore , participant ask inform investigator participant experience health problem experiment . If side effect discover investigator , participant inform immediately . Benefits experiment There benefit subject participation study . However , participant may find his/her phantom limb pain alleviate experiment result electrical stimulation . However , possible investigator predict electrical stimulation affect phantom limb pain , effect start , large effect , long effect last . It possible offer participant permanent lasting solution termination study . Exclusion suspension experiment If participant , accord assessment investigator , react unexpectedly procedures way suitable continue experiment , participation experiment terminate time . In general , experiment terminate turn subject general tolerate procedure project find experiment exhausting .</detailed_description>
