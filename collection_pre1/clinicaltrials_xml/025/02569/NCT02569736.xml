	<brief_summary>Naïve CD4+ helper T ( Th ) cell , upon encounter cognate antigen present professional antigen-presenting cell , differentiate different effector cell : - Th1 cell produce Interferon-γ regulate antigen presentation immunity intracellular pathogen ; - Th2 cell produce IL-4 ( Interleukin-4 ) , IL-5 IL-13 , mediate humoral response immunity parasites ; - Th17 cell produce IL-17 , IL-17F IL-22 regulate inflammatory response tissue cell . An additional TH subset call follicular helper T ( Tfh ) cell recently identify germinal center also whole blood ( circulate Tfh cell ) . These cell regulate B-cell maturation immunoglobulin production normal immune response . They produce factor essential B cell selection maturation memory B-cells long-lived antibody-secreting plasma cell . Furthermore , also seem favor pathogenic autoantibody production systemic autoimmunity , therefore could potentially represent novel therapeutic target autoimmune disease . Indeed , rheumatoid arthritis synovium characterize presence ectopic lymphoid structure , resemble germinal center . Potentially , Tfh cell nonlymphoid tissue could promote B-cell maturation synthesis pathogenic autoantibody production , thus potentiate tissue injury . Interestingly , production IL-21 Tfh cell implicate B cell activation , cytokine associate rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) pathogenesis . IL-6 block therapy significantly reduce sign symptom well radiological progression RA . However , far , determine pleiotropic IL-6 effect impact observe clinical response . Recently , Samson et al demonstrate Tocilizumab ( TCZ ) correct imbalance Th17 cell Treg cell patient RA . More interestingly , group Hans-Peter Tony report impact TCZ B cell compartment . They show significant reduction frequency peripheral pre-switch post-switch memory B cell also reduction serum immunoglobulin level , could reflect TCZ Tfh cell development , circulation and/or function . Most work study role IL-6 Tfh cell development perform mouse . They show optimal Tfh cell formation require IL-21 IL-6 , cytokines alone insufficient drive Tfh cell differentiation . To good understand impact IL-6 human Tfh cell , investigator would like conduct prospective study patient active RA investigate effect block IL-6 TCZ circulate Tfh cell level Tfh cell subsets 12-week study period . Furthermore , impact TCZ treatment Tfh cell generation explore vitro .</brief_summary>
