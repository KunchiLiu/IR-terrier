	<brief_summary>Anhedonia , decrease motivation sensitivity reward experience , present least 1/3 community dwell old adult feature various psychiatric neurological disorder , include late-life depression Parkinson 's disease . Anhedonia associate cognitive deficit , well poor clinical outcome increase mortality . Recent research suggest anhedonia comprises motivational ( reward `` want '' ) consummatory ( reward `` liking '' ) aspect . However , previous research anhedonia fail dissociate component , may explain contradictory finding literature . Recently , Effort-Expenditure Rewards Task ( EEfRT ) develop effort dissociate reward component anhedonia . The EEfRT effort-based decision-making task measure reward `` want '' , contrast commonly use anhedonia questionnaire , focus reward `` liking . '' This novel task may provide useful measure component anhedonia old adult different patient population . Thus far data available task elderly individual , cognitive neural correlate component task investigate . Given paucity research neurobiology anhedonia , cognitive neuroscience study use task could fill gap literature . The investigator develop line cognitive neuroscience study examine anhedonia community-dwelling older adult late-life depression Parkinson 's disease . This study involve gather pilot behavioral functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) data young old adult perform EEfRT task . Understanding brain mechanism underlie anhedonia old adult different patient population translational impact elucidate biological target treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dissociating Components Anhedonia : A Pilot fMRI Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Twenty young adult ( age 18-38 ) 20 old adult ( age 60-80 ) perform EEfRT fMRI data acquire . To quantify brain activity associate reward `` wanting , '' fMRI activation measure participant view information reward probability choose perform easy hard task , great reward associate hard task . The investigator measure activation presentation reward magnitude capture brain activity associate reward `` liking . '' Participants also complete brief cognitive battery anhedonia questionnaire .</detailed_description>
