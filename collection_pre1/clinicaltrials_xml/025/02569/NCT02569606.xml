	<brief_title>Transfusion Coagulation Management Trauma Patients After Introduction Coagulation Algorithm</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Trauma one lead cause death worldwide . After death due direct craniofacial injury , exsanguination next major cause trauma mortality . After initial pre-hospital treatment patient admit hospital . If multiple injury present patient transfer specialized trauma center . Besides surgical treatment , patient need stabilization vital function Anesthesiologist . Due loss blood volume , dilution circulatory blood volume pathological activation coagulation/fibrinolysis , trauma induce coagulopathy ( TIC ) initiate . This need treat avoid whenever possible . Transfusion allogeneic blood coagulation product lead increased morbidity mortality . Infectious immunologic reaction account phenomenon . This lead paradigm change therapy TIC . In 2009 new coagulation factor base coagulation algorithm introduce Hospital Lucerne University Hospital Zurich / Switzerland . With help point care coagulation measurement , tailor coagulation factor base coagulation management avoidance allogeneic blood product initiate . The investigator want analyze impact coagulation algorithm compare period introduction algorithm . The consumption blood coagulation product ( pack red blood cell , fresh frozen plasma , platelet concentrate , fibrinogen , coagulation factor concentrate , coagulation factor XIII , activate factor VII , van Willebrand factor antifibrinolytics ) introduction designate trauma related transfusion coagulation algorithm record compare . The period 2005-2007 ( ) 2012-2014 ( ) introduction review . Predicted probability massive transfusion TASH score ( trauma associate acute hemorrhage ) correlate actual rate .</detailed_description>
