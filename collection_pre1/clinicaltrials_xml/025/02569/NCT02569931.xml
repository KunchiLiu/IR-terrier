	<brief_summary>The principal objective study find everyday activity make kneecap unstable people patellofemoral instability . Analysing patient unstable kneecap walk help u determine surgery successful patient see good score patient questionnaire find patient follow surgery whether patient also better pattern walking . The investigator aim use camera pressure pad see patient walk surgery see compare patient score questionnaire . If investigator find patient walk good surgery justify surgery worthwhile patient cost effective NHS .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Unstable Kneecap - Impact Anatomy Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recruitment strategy : Patients refer specialist patellofemoral clinic unstable kneecap ( ) approach student ask whether would interested participate study ( study group ) . Participants consider eligible study group two episode kneecap dislocation many episode instability least one following : feeling kneecap dislocate pressure , tenderness along inner side knee and/or abnormal movement position kneecap . They give Patient Information Sheet ( PIS ) give time clinic ask question study . During first appointment per routine current clinical practice X-ray knee fill standard questionnaire score knee function pain ( Norwich Patellofemoral Instability score , Kujala score , PainDetect score , catastrophising score ) . The patient 's knee also examine consultant record make clinical finding . As per routine practice , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan knee organise 4 week original appointment measurement knee shape record . A total 32 patient invite join study assess movement kneecap patient kneecap instability . A group normal knee ( control group ) study compare finding student age 18 50 year St George 's University London allow age gender match study group . Students previous history knee problem eligible join control group . Inclusion criterion group include age 18-50 year , English language speaker , able use public transport drive . Exclusion criterion group include pregnancy , breast feeding , inability give inform consent , inflammatory arthropathy , osteoarthritis . All participant study control group provide Participant Information Sheet ( PIS ) outline study design , objective , procedure , data management dissemination plan . Participants minimum seven day consider participation study . If participant express interest participating , time read , consider discuss PIS clinic , provide appointment MSk Lab Imperial College . At start assessment participant ask potential eligibility base pre-defined eligibility criterion provide opportunity ask question study . If still interested participating , potential participant ask complete three Consent Forms enrol study . Data Collection : Each patient participant complete Norwich Patellar Instability ( NPI ) Score questionnaire , Kujala Patellofemoral Disorders Score , PainDetect score Catastrophising score validate questionnaire . Baseline data record prior test include : presence joint hypermobility syndrome ( Beighton score ) , age , gender , duration symptom , frequency kneecap dislocation , knee range motion , MRC ( Medical Research Council ) muscle strength ( flexion extension ) , previous patellofemoral joint surgery , family history patellar instability whether patellar instability unilateral bilateral . Basic demographic data multi-variate regression analysis ( e.g . Body Mass Index data ) also collect , along measurement leg length / height require Hof scaling . Testing Procedure : Both control study group gait analysis measurement perform baseline data collection . After six minute acclimatization period 4km/h instrument treadmill ( Kistler Gaitway , Kistler Instrument Corporation , Amherst , NY ) , speed increase either subject feel uncomfortable , walk performance deteriorates . The procedure generally take 12 minute continuous walk . Following flat ground assessment , inclination increase 5° increment steady 4 km/h , either subject feel uncomfortable , walk deteriorates . The treadmill ramp inclination 7° downhill . The subject ask walk initially 4 km/h , 0.5 km/h increment either feel uncomfortable , walk performance deteriorates . At incremental interval speed inclination , data way participant walk collect limbs special plate treadmill track . Body weight scale leg length also apply outputted mechanical data correct difference . All data subject average filter handle large amount continuous data machine capture , normally entail minimum six step limb . The subject ask reproduce activity associate subjective instability ( e.g . run sideways , hop , jumping , turn look shoulder ) determine subjective feeling instability correlate physiological change measurement capture instrumented treadmill . Electrical sensor skin use detect muscle activity . For study group corrective surgery deepen groove , special marker three dimensional scan allow record kneecap movement without disturb underlie tissue see statistically significant measurable difference , correlate change performance/symptom score . Six month surgery study group , gait analysis repeat MSk Lab previously outline determine effect surgery . The patient ask stage fill Kujala NPI score . It anticipate study subject control recruit six month data collection finish year enrolment first patient study . Data Analysis : The primary hypothesis study direct relationship shape kneecap groove participant ' walk performance . This test formally compare measurement take kneecap groove shape , measurement gait . The aim see surgery improve gait stop kneecap dislocate . Study dissemination : The finding study feed back participant . Presentation study finding make local level submission presentation regional meeting nationally prior submission journal offer open access publish allow dissemination professional public .</detailed_description>
