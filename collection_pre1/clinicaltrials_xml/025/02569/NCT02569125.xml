	<brief_title>Open Label Study Everolimus ( RAD001 ) Patients With Segmental Overgrowth Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Segmental overgrowth syndrome rare disease extremely relevant genetic background . In , 200 case know worldwide , example Proteus syndrome present asymmetric fast growth extremity . Further overgrowth disease SOLAMEN CLOVE syndrome lipomatosis , vascular malformation epidermal nevus well Cowden syndrome multiple hamartomas Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome lipomatosis macrocephalus . The patient overgrowth syndromes show close clinical overlap . For several year , clinical criterion ( phenotype ) diagnosis discrimination syndrome define . Results genetic research today help diagnose segmental overgrowth syndrome mean clearly name . Genes PI3K/AKT/PTEN/mTOR signal pathway identify causative syndrome . PTEN germline mutation know present SOLAMEN , Cowden Ruvalcaba syndrome patient show tissue overgrowth close clinical overlap . However , rarely , somatic PTEN mutation could detect surgical specimen lipomas hamartomas segmental overgrowth patient . Only recently , recurrent somatic activating mutation AKT1 identify overgrowth tissue Proteus syndrome patient . Because AKT1 also activate loss-of-function mutation PTEN , patient syndromes harbour germline PTEN mutation ( SOLAMEN , Cowden Ruvalcaba ) Proteus syndrome patient activate mutation AKT1 show close overlap clinical manifestation . Furthermore , somatic PI3KCA mutation describe responsible CLOVE syndrome , phenotypically closely related variant overgrowth syndrome . These genetic result confirm patient overgrowth share common feature involve PI3K/AKT/PTEN/mTOR signal pathway . Next surgical approach functional handicap patient , standard medical therapy available . Therefore , case , watch-and-wait strategy follow . Taking account genetic background segmental overgrowth patient , mTOR promise target possible medical treatment . For example , direct molecular consequence PTEN loss-of-function aberrant activation mTOR pathway , target mTOR hold promise causative treatment PTEN-positive segmental overgrowth patient . Until today , three case report describe successful use mTOR inhibitor Rapamycin therapy patient segmental overgrowth PTEN germline mutation . The Investigator recently start `` label '' use Rapamycin patient . First result successfully treated patient present The Annual meeting German Society Human Genetics 2011 meeting International Society Studies Vascular Anomalies 2012 . In one patient segmental overgrowth syndrome response Rapamycin , investigator could identify PI3KCA mutation one lesion . This case currently prepare publication . Interestingly , response mTOR inhibition could demonstrate patient although lack mutation publish gene responsible overgrowth syndrome . A clinical trial sponsor National Cancer Institute test ability Rapamycin decrease activity protein regulate mTOR benign cancerous tumour tissue Cowden syndrome patient ( NCT00971789 ) . Only patient age 18 year include multiple biopsy perform start treatment therapy Rapamycin .</detailed_description>
