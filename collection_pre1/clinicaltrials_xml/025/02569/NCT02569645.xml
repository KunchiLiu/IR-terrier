	<brief_title>Rosuvastatin Treatment Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The standard treatment locally advanced rectal cancer involve neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy ( CRT ) follow surgery adjuvant chemotherapy . The pathologic complete response associate neoadjuvant CRT 10-20 % . The prognosis patient undergo neoadjuvant CRT associate extent post-treatment tumour regression , final primary tumour stage presence involve lymph node surgical specimen . This data suggest treatment enhance pathological response may result improvement survival . Overwhelming preclinical clinical evidence suggest statin demonstrate anticancer property sensitize cancer tissue protect normal tissue effect radiation . Hence , investigator hypothesize addition rosuvastatin standard CRT treatment locally advanced rectal cancer may improve pathological response rate . This protocol describe open-label single-arm phase 2 study design test hypothesis . Moreover , study also identify genetic , serological , pathological biomarkers may prognostic predictive response toxicity treatment .</detailed_description>
