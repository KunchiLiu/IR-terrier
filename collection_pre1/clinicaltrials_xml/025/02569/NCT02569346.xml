	<detailed_description>Dolutegravir HIV-1 integrase inhibitor market single tablet ( Tivicay速 ) fix dose combination tablet abacavir lamivudine ( Triumeq速 , refer TRI ) . For patient swallow difficulty , administration whole tablet problematic tablet cut crushed ease administration . In addition , HIV patient develop opportunistic infection , patient become severely ill may end intensive care . Patients intensive care might able swallow medication . Therefore useful know possible administer TRI different route , like feed tube . If TRI crush dissolve give catheter also useful know give drip feed . Currently information crush TRI tablet . Depending biopharmaceutical characteristic drug formulation , crush tablet lead alter pharmacokinetics drug . This show antiretroviral drug , ritonavir , lopinavir , efavirenz tenofovir . It important know whether pharmacokinetics influence crush tablet low concentration associate virologic failure . Therefore high dos switch HIV-drugs might need . In addition , high Cmax and/or exposure lead toxicity . As result therapeutic drug monitoring advise , crush drug contra-indication base available data . It show DTG plasma concentration influence food , high AUC en Cmax high-fat meal compare administration fast state . During clinical development , however , dolutegravir intake study without regard food intake . Therefore , recommend dolutegravir take without food . In addition , show simultaneous oral ingestion antacid dolutegravir give decrease Cmax AUC dolutegravir . This interaction show co-ingestion omeprazole , make unlikely interaction cause pH-lowering effect influence absorption dolutegravir . It probably local gastrointestinal complexation phenomenon , similar observe HIV integrase inhibitor . A possible pharmacokinetic interaction dolutegravir complexation former may expect . Especially consider active binding site dolutegravir bind magnesium metal ion cofactor . It currently unclear certain food liquid contain high amount magnesium cation , like drip feed , cause interaction . Therefore study conduct investigate whether crush suspend TRI crush suspended TRI drip feed bioequivalent take TRI whole .</detailed_description>
