	<criteria>I 1 . Subject provide write consent . 2 . In Investigator 's opinion , subject able understand comply protocol requirement , instruction , protocol state restriction likely complete study plan . 3 . Male female , 1870 year age . 4 . Body mass index ( BMI ) 1835 kg/m^2 , inclusive . 5 . A woman childbearing potential must negative serum ( βhuman chorionic gonadotropin ) pregnancy test screening . 6 . Female subject must either : childbearing potential define : i. Postmenopausal least 12 month ( i.e. , 2 year amenorrhea without alternative medical cause ) serum follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) level postmenopausal range ( per reference laboratory ) , OR ii . Surgically sterile ( e.g. , underwent total hysterectomy , bilateral oophorectomy , bilateral tubal ligation/bilateral tubal clip without reversal operation ) , otherwise incapable become pregnant , OR childbearing potential AND heterosexually active ( e.g. , abstinent homosexual ) screen 6 month study drug administration ( longer , dictate local regulation ) , OR heterosexually active vasectomized partner ( confirm sterile per verbal account subject ) , OR use acceptable method birth control screen agree continue use method contraception throughout study 6 month study drug administration ( longer , dictate local regulation ) . Oral hormone base contraceptive allow 14 day plan study drug administration 6 month last dose treatment due potential drugdrug interaction might undermine efficacy . An IUD , either hormonal ( i.e. , IUS* ) nonhormonal , consider highly effective reliable ; therefore subject use IUD/IUS require use additional contraceptive method ( doublebarrier method require ) . Other nonoral hormonebased contraception method ( e.g. , injectable , implant , transdermal system , vaginal ring ) may continue , interaction study drug hormonebased contraception unknown , method consider reliable therefore subject use doublebarrier method ( e.g. , male condom+either diaphragm cervical cap without spermicide ) . An IUS rely systemic plasma concentration therefore expect impacted potential DDI . Note 1 : Sexual abstinence consider highly effective method define refrain heterosexual intercourse entire period risk associate study drug . The reliability sexual abstinence need evaluate relation duration study prefer usual lifestyle subject . Note 2 : A male female condom use together due risk breakage damage cause latex friction . 7 . A postmenopausal female receive hormone replacement therapy willing discontinue hormone therapy 30 day study drug dose agrees remain hormone replacement therapy duration study may eligible study participation . Male subject must either : surgically sterile ( vasectomy ) , otherwise incapable father child , OR heterosexually active ( e.g. , abstinent homosexual ) enrollment ( Day 1 ) study least 6 month study drug administration , OR heterosexually active : partner postmenopausal ( 2 year amenorrhea ) , surgically sterile ( e.g. , total hysterectomy , bilateral oophorectomy , bilateral tubal ligation/bilateral tubal clip without reversal operation ) , otherwise incapable become pregnant OR practice acceptable method birth control enrollment study ( Day 1 ) agree continue use method contraception throughout study least 6 month study drug administration ( longer , dictate local regulation ) . An acceptable method birth control male subject doublebarrier method ( e.g. , male condom+either diaphragm cervical cap without spermicide ) . Note : Male subject female partner use hormonal contraceptive ( oral , injectable , implant ) hormonal ( IUS ) nonhormonal IUD male subject vasectomize otherwise incapable father child require use additional contraceptive method . Note 1 : Sexual abstinence consider highly effective method define refrain heterosexual intercourse entire period risk associate study drug . The reliability sexual abstinence need evaluate relation duration study prefer usual lifestyle subject . Note 2 : A male female condom use together due risk breakage damage cause latex friction . NOTE : Contraceptive use men woman consistent local regulation regard use contraceptive method subject participate clinical study stricter propose inclusion criterion 8 . Subjects must agree refrain sperm/egg donation start dose 6 month completion study drug administration . 9 . GT1a 1b GT2 3 CHC , depend cohort , positive HCV antibody positive HCV RNA screen include documentation CHC infection least 6 month . Genotype test must occur screen visit . NOTE : GT1 patient eligible inclusion even successfully subtyped unless specific subtype require cohort . 10 . Screening HCV RNA viral load ≥50,000 IU/mL , except subject compensate cirrhosis ( Child Pugh Class A ) may HCV RNA viral load ≥10^4 IU/mL . 11 . No prior treatment CHC ( define prior exposure approve investigational drug include directacting antiviral , interferonbased treatment ) 12 . Fibroscan , collect within 6 month baseline visit , liver stiffness score ≤12.5 kPa eligible ( except subject cirrhosis , see ) . • Subjects compensate cirrhosis must meet ChildPugh Class A definition ( see Appendix G ) least one follow criterion : i. Liver biopsy result indicate presence cirrhosis ( e.g. , Metavir F4 ; Ishak &gt; 5 ) ii . Fibroscan evaluation liver stiffness score &gt; 12.5 kPa 13 . Subject otherwise good health deem investigator , base finding medical evaluation include medical history , physical examination , laboratory test ECG . 14 . Willing avoid prolonged sun exposure use tan device take SMV 4 week follow . Subjects also advise use broadspectrum sunscreen lip balm least sun protection factor &gt; 30 help protect potential sunburn . 1 . Pregnant , plan become pregnant ( treatment 6 month EOT ) , breastfeed female subject , male subject whose female partner pregnant planning become pregnant ( treatment 6 month EOT ) 2 . Other CHC without compensate cirrhosis , clinically significant cardiovascular , respiratory , renal , gastrointestinal , hematologic , neurologic , thyroid medical illness psychiatric disorder , determine Investigator and/or Sponsor 's Medical Monitor . 3 . History clinical evidence significant unstable cardiac disease ( e.g. , angina , congestive heart failure , myocardial infarction , diastolic dysfunction , significant arrhythmia , coronary heart disease , and/or clinically significant ECG abnormality ) , moderate severe valvular disease uncontrolled hypertension screening . 4 . Screening echocardiogram ejection fraction &lt; 55 % echocardiographic find suggestive clinically relevant cardiomyopathy . 5 . Creatinine clearance &lt; 60 mL/min ( CockcroftGault ) . 6 . Positive test HAV IgM , HBsAg , HIV Ab . 7 . Abnormal screen laboratory result consider clinically significant investigator . 8 . History clinical hepatic decompensation , e.g. , variceal bleeding , spontaneous bacterial peritonitis , ascites , hepatic encephalopathy active jaundice ( within last year ) . 9 . Any condition , opinion investigator , would compromise study 's objective wellbeing subject prevent subject meeting study requirement . 10 . Participation investigational drug trial receive investigational vaccine within 30 day 5 half life ( whichever longer ) prior study medication . 11 . Clinically significant abnormal screen ECG finding ( e.g. , PR &gt; 200 msec , QRS interval &gt; 120 msec correct QT interval ( QTc ) &gt; 450 msec male subject &gt; 470 msec female subject ) , base average triplicate ECGs . Any evidence heart block bundle branch block also exclusionary . 12 . History family history abnormal ECG interval , example prolong QT syndrome ( torsade de pointes ) sudden cardiac death . 13 . The subject positive prestudy drug screen , include methadone unless drug prescribe subject 's physician . The list drug screen include amphetamine , barbiturate , cocaine , opiates , phencyclidine ( PCP ) , benzodiazepine . 14 . Laboratory abnormality include : Hematocrit &lt; 0.34 White blood cell count &lt; 3,500/mm^3 ( &lt; 1,000/mm^3 subject compensate cirrhosis ) Absolute neutrophil count &lt; 1,000/mm^3 ( &lt; 750/mm^3 subject compensate cirrhosis ) Platelets ≤120,000/mm^3 ( platelet ≤90,000/mm^3 subject compensate cirrhosis ) Glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbA1C ) &gt; 55 mmol/mol Prothrombin time ≥1.5 × ULN Albumin ≤32 g/L , bilirubin ≥1.5 mg/dL screening ( subject document Gilbert 's disease allow ) Serum ALT concentration ≥5× ULN CK &gt; 1.5× ULN A single repeat laboratory evaluation appropriate condition ( e.g. , fast , antecedent exercise ) allow eligibility determination . 15 . Any condition possibly affect drug absorption ( e.g. , gastrectomy significant gastrointestinal tract surgery , gastroenterostomy , small bowel resection , active enterostomy ) . 16 .
