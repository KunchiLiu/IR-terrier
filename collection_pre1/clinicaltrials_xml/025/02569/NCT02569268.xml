	<brief_summary>Arteriosclerotic vascular-related disease become serious threat human health . The prevention reversal vascular event become important direction medicine . Early vascular disease detection system include pulse wave velocity ( PWV ) , carotid intima-media thickness ( IMT ) coronary flow velocity reserve ( CFVR ) , flow-mediated vasodilation ( FMD ) , cardio-ankle vascular index ( CAVI ) , ankle-brachial index ( ABI ) , insulin resistance index ( HOMA-IR ) , hypersensitivity C- reactive protein ( hs-CRP ) , plasma homocysteine ( Hcy ) , B-type natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) , uric acid ( UA ) , . However , international domestic comprehensive study simple practical evaluation system joint application evaluation index detect vascular disease . Combined evaluation function simultaneously detect evaluate vascular abnormality , make single indicator shortcoming clinical application multiple level vascular structure function . However , indicator test cause time consuming , also increase burden patient , result unnecessary waste medical resource . Thus , present study select appropriate indicator effective joint , establish rating system , use vascular system predict incidence terminal event , compare system previous score system FRS ( Framingham Risk Score ) pros con .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study aim establish vascular disease early detection system score system comprehensive vascular disease risk factor vascular function evaluation index . And prevention vascular-related disease , high-risk group positive lifestyle change : lipid-lowering , smoke cessation , reverse early vascular lesion , avoid end-stage vascular event . 1 . Detection vascular function indicator include : PWV , IMT , CFVR , FMD , CAVI , ABI , LDL-C , HOMA-IR , hs-CRP , Hcy , BNP , UA . 2 . Design questionnaire : surveying lifestyle , personal history , family history study population . 3 . Follow-up:2 year observation , record end time vascular event , include cardiovascular event ( acute myocardial infarction , angina , coronary reperfusion therapy ) , stroke , heart failure , peripheral vascular disease . 4 . Statistics : Complex factor vascular disease , screen effective indicator predict cardiovascular event , base weight different factor , establish rating system , use system predict incidence vascular event terminal , compare system previous score system FRS ( Framingham Risk Score ) .</detailed_description>
