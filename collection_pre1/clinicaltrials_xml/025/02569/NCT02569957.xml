	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study effect acetylcysteine topotecan hydrochloride tumor microenvironment , cell make tumor , compare topotecan hydrochloride alone patient ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer respond treatment ( persistent ) return period improvement ( recurrent ) high grade ( likely grow spread quickly ) . Research show cancer cell may able convert nearby normal cell cancer cell . Acetylcysteine may stop happen . Topotecan hydrochloride chemotherapy drug use treat ovarian cancer , may help acetylcysteine work well . This trial study effect acetylcysteine topotecan hydrochloride tumor microenvironment see help make difficult tumor cell grow .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Acetylcysteine With Topotecan Hydrochloride Tumor Microenvironment Patients With Persistent Recurrent High Grade Ovarian , Primary Peritoneal , Fallopian Tube Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate proportion subject persistent recurrent high grade endometrioid serous ovarian carcinoma demonstrate downregulation monocarboxylate transporter 4 ( MCT4 ) ovarian stroma response exposure topotecan ( topotecan hydrochloride ) N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) ( acetylcysteine ) compare topotecan alone . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine expression level caveolin 1 ( Cav-1 ) , solute carrier family 16 ( monocarboxylate transporter ) , member 1 ( MCT1 ) , translocase outer mitochondrial membrane 20 homolog ( yeast ) ( TOMM20 ) , fatty acid bind protein 4 , adipocyte ( FABP4 ) , hypoxia inducible factor 1 , alpha subunit ( HIF-1 alpha ) NF kappaB activate protein ( NFκB ) pathological sample tumor therapy NAC relative sample take time initial diagnosis . II . To assess potential impact NAC progression free survival , overall survival , objective tumor response- complete partial , duration response . III . To estimate proportion subject survive progression free least 6 month proportion patient objective tumor response , complete partial response therapy IV . To assess safety tolerability NAC plus topotecan treatment subject endometrioid serous ovarian carcinoma Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version ( v ) 4.0 criterion . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 arm . ARM I : Patients receive topotecan hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 ( +/- 1 day window treatment day ) . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive topotecan hydrochloride Arm I . Patients also receive acetylcysteine IV 60 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 ( +/- 1 day window treatment day ) acetylcysteine orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 2-7 , 9-14 , 16-21 , 23-28 , unless administration window utilized . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 24 month .</detailed_description>
