	<detailed_description>Inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) chronic gastrointestinal condition significant morbidity form hospitalization , surgery , reduction quality life . Most patient IBD manage ambulatory , outpatient setting . However , optimally manage severe disease activity , hospitalization may require . Hospitalized patient increase risk variety complication infection , venous thrombosis , surgery . The literature reveal significant variation care disease outcomes among hospitalized IBD patient . The heterogeneous nature IBD severity , location , phenotype well limited evidence guide therapeutic domain make standardization IBD care delivery difficult . However , hospitalize patient ulcerative colitis ( UC ) represent homogenous group may amendable quality improvement initiative aim reduce variation , know surrogate marker poor performance . The Canadian Association Gastroenterology develop guideline hospitalize UC patient . It well establish , however , update guideline variable . Admission hospital also significant impact quality life due interruption life commitment lose sense control disease . Maintaining sense self-control disease active participation care show valuable among individual chronic disease IBD . The investigator propose development multi-site , patient center initiative aim improve clinically relevant patient-centered outcome multi-faceted educational tool patient admit hospital ulcerative colitis . Participating site randomize usual care versus administer educational tool patient outline expect hospital stay review current guideline hospitalize ulcerative colitis management .</detailed_description>
