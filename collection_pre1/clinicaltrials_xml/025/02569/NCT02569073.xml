	<brief_summary>In recent study , Dronabinol show reduce symptom patient Functional Chest Pain ( non-cardiac chest pain ) . Additionally , metabolic measure patient ' weight adversely affect regiment . In fact , cholesterol measure trend favorable direction Dronabinol . The study last 28 day patient take Dronabinol twice daily . The goal current study focus reduce dose Dronabinol see goal achieve . More , study extend 12 week gain longitudinal picture therapy Dronabinol . It hypothesize reduce dose extend duration continue show improvement symptom well adverse metabolic outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Investigation Cannabinoid Receptor Agonist Dronabinol Patients With Functional Chest Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>About 200,000 new case Functional Chest Pain ( FCP ) diagnose annually USA . FCP associate poor quality life high health care expenditure . Gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) , esophageal motility disorder , psychological disorder may cause FCP . However , mechanism ( ) FCP continue explore include central peripheral hypersensitivity well biomechanical dysfunction esophageal wall . CB1 receptor activation synaptic cleft fine tune neuronal firing may fact quell excitation associate hypersensitivity . Dronabinol , cannabinoid receptor agonist preference CB1 CB2 , believe reduce esophageal hypersensitivity . CB1 receptor locate primarily central peripheral neuron ( include enteric nervous system ) myenteric plexus modulate neurotransmitter release . Activation pre-junctional CB1 receptor may reduce excitatory enteric transmission conceivably improve esophageal hyperreactivity hypersensitivity , hallmarks FCP . Previously , show Chest Pain Symptoms greatly reduce patient take 5 mg Dronabinol twice daily . Patients side effect regiment although sedation report . The goal study focus reduce dose Dronabinol 5 mg every day , essentially , one quarter dose . The effect Dronabinol vary CB1 receptor density various tissue . It hypothesize reduce dose relief chest pain still achieve without sedate effect . More , Dronabinol 5 mg twice daily fail produce adverse metabolic outcome include measure glucose , LDL , triglyceride , leptin , transaminase . Dronabinol treatment tend improve measure although study last 28 day . Currently hypothesis low dos protracted time course fail perturb homeostasis .</detailed_description>
