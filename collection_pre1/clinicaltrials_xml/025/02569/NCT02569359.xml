	<detailed_description>Hemophilia X-linked recessive bleeding disorder cause deficiency coagulation factor VIII ( hemophilia A ) IX ( hemophilia B ) . Severe hemophilia patient may frequent spontaneous bleed episode joint muscle bleeding . Repeated joint bleeding lead chronic synovitis , cartilage damage bony destruction , associate range motion ( ROM ) limitation , pain , muscle atrophy , functional impairment poor quality life . Around 80 % spontaneous joint bleeds occur ankle , knee elbow . Hemophilic arthropathy multifactorial event evidence suggest iron may play major role release cytokines Interleukin-1 , Interleukin-6 , tumor necrosis factor-α ( TNF-α ) eading chronic proliferative synovitis , hypervascularity , progressive arthropathy . Prophylactic replacement , physical therapy , COX-2 inhibitor , corticosteroid , radionucleotide synovectomy typical modality use management hemophilic synovitis arthropathy . The onset joint bleeding severe hemophilia occur approximately 23 month age arthropathy could mark adolescent young adult . Some hemophilia patient may either good candidate surgery may prefer surgery . The traditional Africans use African Shea tree shea nut oil extract treat arthritis . Shea nut oil contains mixture fatty acid cinnamic acid ester triterpene alcohols α-amyrine , β-amyrine , butyrospermol , lupeol aminor extent , sterol , aliphatic alcohol , karitene . Triterpene alcohols lupeol α/β-amyrine show possess anti-inflammatory effect , especially esterified form . In 1998 , US Food Drug Administration approve shea nut oil safe food additive . The shea nut oil use trial patented concentrate contain approximately 50 % triterpenes derive seed shea tree , Vitellaria paradoxa . The abundant triterpenes shea nut oil areα-amyrin ( 54.6 % ) , β-amyrin ( 12.3 % ) , Lupeol ( 17 % ) plus dihydro-derivatives . Cheras et al . report shea nut oil extract treatment 15 week random double-blind study upper quartile 89 osteoarthritis patient effective decrease inflammation marker TNF-α ( 23.9 % vs 6 % , treatment v placebo ) cartilage degradation marker C-terminal crosslinked telopeptide type II collagen ( CTX-II ) ( 28.7 % vs increase 17.6 % , treatment v placebo ) . Chen colleague carry 16-week study 33 patient osteoarthritis knee joint find shea nut oil effective increasing activity thickness vastus medialis , decrease pain stiffness knee joint . Late stage hemophilic arthropathy characterize advanced cartilage degeneration joint destruction . These effect cartilage subchondral bone degenerative inflammatory nature , similar change osteoarthritis . Management chronic hemophilic arthropathy difficult . NSAIDs use caution patient bleed disorder inhibition platelet function gastrointestinal side effect . In clinical practice , choice NSAIDs also need take consideration risk cardiovascular event use lowest effective dose short duration . This study investigate safety efficacy Shea nut oil treatment hemophilic arthropathy .</detailed_description>
