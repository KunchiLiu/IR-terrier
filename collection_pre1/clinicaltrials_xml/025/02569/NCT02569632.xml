	<brief_summary>This study investigate breadth protection meningococcal disease human immunized newly FDA approve meningococcal B vaccine , trade name `` Trumenba® '' manufacture Pfizer Vaccines . As secondary goal investigator investigate underlying mechanism human anti-FHbp antibody elicit complement-mediated bactericidal activity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Neisseria meningitidis cause meningitis severe infection blood stream . The incidence serogroup B meningococcal disease however low conduct randomize , control trial determine actual efficacy new serogroup B vaccine . Instead vaccine efficacy infer serum bactericidal antibody responses use four test strain . However , strain variability FHbp amino acid sequence ( 800 sequence variant describe ) strain variability FHbp expression , bactericidal data four strain unlikely sufficient predict actual strain coverage vaccine . There also gap knowledge underlie mechanism human antibody FHbp elicit complement mediate bactericidal activity . For example , bind FH FHbp specific human FH . Therefore vaccinated human vaccine antigen expect form complex FH right immunization . The investigator ' hypothesis bind human FH vaccine antigen skew antibody repertoire FHbp epitopes locate outside FH combine site . The resulting antibody would expect inhibit bind FH bacteria . This hypothesis investigate Trumenba-immunized human part study Aim 1 ( future study recombinant human anti-FHbp Fabs enable obtain DNA individual B cell , describe Aim 2 ) .</detailed_description>
