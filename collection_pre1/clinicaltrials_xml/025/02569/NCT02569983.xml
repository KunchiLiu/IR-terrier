	<brief_title>The SOCQER-2 Study Surgery Ovarian Cancer - Quality Life Evaluation Research</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND The cornerstone treatment advanced ovarian cancer surgical cytoreduction systemic therapy . The aim surgery maximal cytoreduction visible disease , ideally reach total macroscopic tumour clearance . Whilst gynaecological oncologist accept surgical procedure need achieve complete cytoreduction continuum , Cochrane review summarise type ovarian cancer surgery follow : - standard surgery - radical surgery - supra- [ ultra- ] radical surgery Several observational study two systematic review non-randomised study show association amount residual disease follow surgery survival , control various confound factor . However , systematic review identify randomise control trial directly compare standard surgery versus extensive surgery . A National Institute Health Care Excellence ( NICE ) Interventional Procedures Overview find number retrospective observational study compare extensive standard surgery , find woman underwent extensive surgery well survival undergo standard surgery , thus suggest utilisation surgical procedure achieve complete cytoreduction may overcome disease aggressiveness . Incidence serious complication , however , high patient undergo extensive surgery . However , several confound factor e.g patient good performance status likely select undergo extensive surgery . Equally , patient lesser disease burden complete removal tumour standard surgery alone . A Cochrane review compare outcome ultra-radical surgery versus standard conclude unclear whether difference progression free survival , quality life morbidity , randomise control trial sufficient statistical power well-designed non-randomised study need . Equally important outcome survival value pertinent patient carers . To date , methodologically robust study evaluate Quality life ( Patient Reported Outcomes ) patient undergo extensive surgery achieve tumour clearance . Patient report outcomes multidimensional health relate quality life measurement . This study build upon single site pilot study , evaluate short medium term Patient report Outcomes ( PRO ) Pan Birmingham gynaecological cancer centre . SOCQER-1 compare PRO Outcomes 64 woman ovarian cancer , 24 extensive surgery ; SOCQER-1 find statistically significant difference PRO woman undergo standard extensive surgery ovarian cancer 9 month postoperative period - however limitation small sample size single centre study note . SOCQER-2 provide long term PRO Outcomes survival large cohort undergo extensive surgery capture variation practice centre . SOCQER-2 provide good quality prospective evidence impact extensive surgery Quality life survival patient ovarian cancer large , multiple UK gynaecological cancer centre . STUDY DESIGN Patients identify MDT/at clinic approach subsequent contact . A team member participate centre provide information leaflet , explain obtain informed consent . Sites option send patient information sheet post patient also option consent post . This study intend exploratory study . The underlying hypothesis test whether patient undergo extensive surgery 13 % reduction ( consider clinically significant difference ) Quality life compare patient similar cancer burden 6 month postoperative timepoint balance 4 month survival gain patient extensive surgery group . The study prospective , multicentre observational cohort study . Clinical data capture prospectively use CRFs baseline , surgery , postoperative 18 month outcome . Patients complete QoL questionnaires 6 week , 6 month , 12 month , 18 month 24 month postsurgery . For patient undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy , also complete prechemo questionnaire SAMPLE SIZE As study intend 'exploratory ' , investigator aim calculate minimal sample size , assumption 2:1 recruitment extensive surgery : standard surgery group . A review randomise control trial find even quality life primary endpoint , sample size always report consistent basis calculation . Analysis repeat measure quality life data take account miss data use appropriate method multiple imputation miss item analysis assume data Missing Completely Random recommend . Therefore mixed model propose analysis repeat measure data . Regarding sample size repeat measure quality life data , common practice pick single time point calculate sample base single difference group mean , inflate sample size dropout . This give conservative estimate sample size case . This approach adopt , although sample size calculation base repeated measure model accurate , case approach unlikely provide accuracy , give uncertainty final group size observational study . The investigator assume maximal quality life difference 6 month expect basis clinical estimate ratio group size extensive v standard surgery 2:1 . The investigator assume p &lt; .05 power 80 % . It suggest evidence base medium difference EORTC QLC 30 13 point . The mean score stage II-IV ovarian cancer patient baseline EORTC score manual 56.3 ( SD 24.5 ) , six month follow-up score trial neo-adjuvant versus primary de-bulking surgery 73.1 ( SD3.0 ) six month primary surgery arm ( n=201 ) . The difference Standard deviation may reflect tight inclusion criterion randomise trial , might assume observational study surgical candidate would fall somewhere two figure . Assuming QLC 30 six month may lower average undergoing extensive surgery 66 , standard deviation report score manual 24 ( likely conservative assumption ) 13 point difference would clinical importance , sample size 123 ( group 1=41 group 2=82 ) would require , additional allowance dropout comparable SD report score manual ( 10 20 patient ) ( calculation make Stata 13.1 ) . In single centre SOCQER study , baseline EORTC QLC30 mean score 58.33 ( SD 21.6 ) standard surgery group ( n=32 ) 63.1 ( SD 25.6 ) extensive surgery group , figure broadly line EORTC manual . The maximum difference group 6 point favour extensive surgery group 6 week postsurgery small difference favour standard surgery group 3 , 6 9 month . Although difference point reach suggest level evidence base medium size difference quality life , give single centre study may incur selection bias group difference stage residual disease group , study power detection medium size , rather small difference remain appropriate . Standard deviations high study Greimal trial part may result sample variation . Symptom score however show difference reach statistical significance mixed model , score ( high =poorer outcome ) 35.0 ( SD 17.0 ) extensive surgery group 25.0 ( SD 17 ) standard surgery group . While symptom score consider secondary quality life , sample size 129 assumption would adequate demonstrate difference plus additional allowance dropout . Although one approach sample size calculation subscales RCTs involve quality life outcomes adjust alpha value allow multiple testing , observational study sample size calculation make investigator acknowledge purpose analysis subscale outcome hypothesis generate . However , sample size allow subgroup analysis , know confounders , loss follow-up , additional heterogeneity different patient population treatment policy multiple centre study , case propensity score analysis , loss observation match propensity score matching stage . It therefore represent minimum target maximum ceiling , recruitment continue full 12 month period . Recruitment patient take place course 12 month . The high volume centre ( &gt; 40 ovarian cancer surgery per year ) conduct average 62 surgery per year . STATISTICS All statistical analysis conduct Stata 13 . Differences `` extensive '' `` standard '' group baseline variable compare use descriptive statistic statistical test appropriate level measurement sample distribution use . Outcome variable ( composite quality life survival ) group also summarise use mean percentage appropriate . For outcome- As observational study , residual confounding rule , report result acknowledge . For outcome variable measure multiple time point ( specifically patient-reported quality life ) , measure time point describe , repeated measure model use reduce probability type I errors . Imputation technique use data quality life outcome variable miss . Propensity score analysis also consider informative score adequate match achieve . This observational study provide information current practice outcome likely use national guidance , inform future research provide information previous patient experience woman undergo ovarian cancer surgery ; descriptive exploratory analysis carry provide maximal information inform policy design future research . The investigator anticipate compare QoL outcome three group - woman treat standard surgery residual disease ( less cancer load ) , treat standard surgery residual disease ( great cancer load ) extensive surgery residual disease great cancer load use surgery aim overcome ) . Descriptive analysis may include : - identify centre perform extensive surgery extent surgery perform - association specific component ovarian cancer surgery different aspect quality life ; - characteristic patient undergo `` extensive '' `` standard '' therapy include performance status ; - description postoperative quality life might indicate opportunity intervention around specific morbidity supportive care potential improve patient 's quality life . - Associations PROMs .</detailed_description>
