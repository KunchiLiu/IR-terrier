	<detailed_description>Background Long-term survival patient cancer rectum ( RC ) last 20 year dramatically improve 30 % 65 % . Overall focus disease creation multidisciplinary team , national quality databases certification surgeon , etc . contribute development especially last 10-15 year . The introduction pre-operative Oncology , know neoadjuvant treatment increase survival rate 10 % certain patient series . However , prognosis remain poor advanced case , qua risk metastasis local cancer relapse . Surgical treatment remain cornerstone curative treatment RC . Total mesorectal excision ( TME ) include resection tumor surround mesorectal fat . TME currently use gold standard surgical treatment RC . The use TME reduce local relapse rate le 10 % . TME surgery combine preoperative chemotherapy radiation therapy cancer advance stage ( T3 ) , often high-dose radiotherapy chemotherapy advance case T-stage 4 . Complications TME present 40 % patient . Most often form wound dehiscence , infection , sexual dysfunction , bowel disorder necessity stoma . More 50 % patient permanently reduce quality life . Minimally invasive therapy ( trans-anal endoscopic microsurgery ( TEM ) ) curative treatment early rectal cancer , well-validated . The complication rate low , , operative mortality le 1 % even elderly patient comorbidities , oppose 10 % standard surgery . The use TEM surgery early rectum cancer select patient thus able reduce risk complication improve overall long-term survival . Even though disease-specific survival reduce due less radical procedure . The Danish screening program colorectal cancer result significant increase detection early cancer . Thus , past 10-15 year , develop complex treatment algorithm tailor surgery , combination oncological treatment necessary . The full benefit available treatment option require pre-treatment , stage classify disease patient allocate proper treatment . The tumor extent ingrowth different layer rectum ( T-stage ) carry great certainty preoperatively . Patients tumor stage T1 may candidate TEM surgery 10 % patient metastases lymph node . Cancers stage T2 may candidate TEM increase operative mortality risk . A local resection cancer course undesirable , lymph node metastasis include resection . Distant metastasis certainty detect CT MRI scan . Preoperative assessment lymph node involvement difficult uncertain daring use allocate candidate local resection . The indication TEM treatment rectal cancer potentially extend could allocate patient independent tumor stage - base lymph node stage . The detection disease spread lymph node decisive impact choice treatment modality . Moreover impact prognosis local recurrence . 1 . Local resection perform N0 . 2 . The number involve lymph node prognostic value outcome surgery RC . 3 . Detection tumor cell lymph node mesorectal fascia ( forms circumferential resection margin CRM ) increase risk recurrence . Patients must neoadjuvant oncological treatment . 4 . Lymph node locate outside mesorectal fascia may require extended lymphadenectomy , achieve good oncological outcome avoid relapse . Today , magnetic resonance scan ( MRI ) trans rectal ultrasound ( TRUS ) use gold standard image stag RC . Studies demonstrate high specificity assessment T stage CRM use preoperative MRI . Comparative high specificity obtain intermediate hand TRUS . In contrast T stage CRM classification , MR TRUS show poor result compare N-staging RC . Even bad result arise use conventional Computed Tomography Scan ( CT ) lymph node diagnostics , median sensitivity 80 % ( 62.5 91.9 % ) median specificity 77.8 % ( 50- 87.9 % ) . Research direct towards improvement lymph node diagnostics RC , order take full advantage differentiate treatment . Dual Energy Computed Tomography ( DECT ) image modality , recent year gain foothold diagnosis several type micro-lesions . DECT provide information tissue reaction affect different energy level . This give information composition , base know K-edge value different substance . K-edge define maximum visual attenuation substance DECT scan affect certain amount energy . The energy require achieve give k-edge depend individual substance atomic size , therefore increase atomic mass . The technique know , example , kidney stone diagnosis , pancreatic cancer staging , vascular anomaly classification aortic aneurysm , detection coronary plaque etc . A study 2013 Zalai Pan et al investigate association histologically confirm gastric cancer , discovery metastatic lymph node DECT . Ninety-six patient include . Two group radiologist blind endoscopic histological finding . Lymph nod 6 mm include N-staging . They find sensitivity 85.4 % N0 , 84.4 % N1 , 91.7 % N2 . Furthermore , show significant difference uptake iodine ( iodine-containing contrast ) K-edge value 33.20 keV , malignant non-malignant lymph node . Thus , hope iodine Gadolinium find X-ray contrast agent , absorb cancer tissue , give recognizable signal dual energy CT scanning . . Hypotheses 1 . It possible develop standardized method DECT scan rectum specimen , remove surgery . 2 . Metastatic lymph node suspect DECT verify histopathological . 3 . DECT increase sensitivity specificity diagnosis lymph node compare imaging modality . 4 . The effect chemo-radiotherapy lymph node detect DECT Study Design The study prospective observational study , base patient newly diagnose rectum cancer Surgical Department A , Odense University Hospital . Patients automatically divide 3 group accord preoperative stratification , group refer direct operation either TEM ( group 1 ) TME ( GROUP2 ) preoperative image staging , group 3 undergo two imaging phase , radio chemo-radiotherapy surgery .
