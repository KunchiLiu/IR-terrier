	<brief_summary>The purpose study well understand myocardial injury AHF . Secondary analysis demonstrate prognostic significance troponin release . The absence release associate less risk . Whether measurement high sensitivity TnT may enable emergency physician well risk stratify acute heart failure patient remain determined . This study help u good understand prognostic value absent low hsTnT value emergency department set . In addition , also test STRATIFY decision rule ; risk score .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hospitalization acute heart failure ( AHF ) result high rate post-discharge mortality re-admissions , well high financial cost . Reducing 30-day re-admissions AHF hospitalization major national quality goal intend improve patient outcome reduce cost . Approximately 85 % emergency department ( ED ) patient AHF hospitalize , 800,000 1,000,000 hospitalization HF originate ED , highlight critical role ED . Even single digit percentage ( i.e . 5 % ) decrease number AHF admission would equate estimate 40,000 few hospitalization . Why many AHF patient hospitalize ? AHF patient high post-discharge event rate . Emergency physicians low risk tolerance . When combine , patient admit . The absence risk score ED set compound problem . Most risk score develop hospital . As hospitalization may affect outcome patient , whether risk score apply ED set unknown . As result , patient low risk ED well-studied . Further , absence high-risk feature necessarily equal absolute low morbidity mortality , though patient likely low risk . In absence risk score , clinical judgment poor substitute often fail identify patient high risk , discharge ED may equal great risk death hospitalize patient . Thus , difficulty identify low risk , combine inherent high morbidity mortality AHF , lead disproportionate number hospitalization . Over decade ago , Agency Healthcare Research Policy Guidelines suggest 50 % AHF patient potential candidate ED discharge observation unit management . Furthermore , nearly half patient hospitalize AHF present lower-risk feature high blood pressure ( &gt; 140mmHg ) BNP &lt; 1000 pg/mL . If low low risk ED patient HF could accurately identify , perhaps great proportion patient AHF could safely discharge observed briefly prior discharge . Study Rationale : With pilot study , generate necessary sufficient pilot data inform design definitive trial test whether identification low risk acute heart failure ( AHF ) patient negative serial high-sensitivity troponin T ( hsTnT ) ED may safely discharge home observe briefly observation status .</detailed_description>
