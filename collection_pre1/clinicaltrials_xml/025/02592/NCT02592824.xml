	<detailed_description>In spite progress cardiac surgery perioperative management postoperative heart failure remain leading cause death organ failure . Although acknowledged major problem cardiac surgery generally accept criterion diagnosis postoperative heart failure . This turn could explain treatment postoperative heart failure poorly document regard clinical outcome . Ischemia prior cardiopulmonary bypass main cause myocardial infarction CABG . Available data demonstrate ischemia evolve myocardial infarction account large proportion patient postoperative heart failure CABG . Conventional treatment postoperative heart failure present therapeutic dilemma inotropic drug aggravate ischemia increase size evolve myocardial infarction , also stimulate apoptotic process may adverse long-term consequence . The role inotropes cardiac surgery therefore controversial . Some author claim liberal use inotropes goal-directed haemodynamic therapy improve outcome whereas report liberal use inotropes associate increased morbidity mortality . Alternative measure enhance myocardial recovery function without put strain heart therefore desirable . Glutamate could influence outcome myocardial ischemia two different biochemical mechanism . First , glutamate improves myocardial tolerance ischemia facilitate anaerobic metabolism substrate level phosphorylation ischemia . The second mechanism relate anaplerotic role glutamate . Glutamate play key role replenishment Krebs cycle intermediate lose ischemia , enhance post-ischemic recovery myocardial oxidative metabolism function . Promoting metabolic functional recovery metabolic support represent novel concept treatment heart failure acute ischemia . Animal experiment suggest glutamate increase myocardial tolerance ischemia glutamate promote post-ischemic recovery . Intravenous glutamate improve metabolic hemodynamic recovery human early CABG . Early clinical experience intravenous metabolic support show need inotropes could substantially reduce clinical outcome regard postoperative mortality , postoperative renal dysfunction long-term survival compare favourably literature . This encouraging experience contribute initiation first GLUTAMICS-trial . The first GLUTAMICS-trial investigate intravenous glutamate infusion give association surgery acute coronary syndrome could prevent myocardial injury , postoperative heart failure reduce mortality . The study negative regard primary endpoint , composite postoperative mortality , perioperative myocardial infarction leave ventricular failure wean cardiopulmonary bypass . However , study include high proportion low risk patient . Furthermore , design primary endpoint suffer liberal preemptive use inotropes patient anticipated wean problem . It become evident clinical endpoint committee meeting preemptive use inotropes prevent detection wean problem patient later develop severe heart failure . The secondary endpoint severe circulatory failure discriminate mild short-lasting heart failure wean cardiopulmonary bypass clinically significant heart failure require substantial circulatory support lead prolonged ICU stay death . In glutamate treat patient relative risk develop severe circulatory failure reduce 50 % risk group undergo isolated CABG . The first GLUTAMICS trial also include substudy consist blinded evaluation NT-proBNP marker postoperative heart failure . Due lack generally accept criterion postoperative heart failure , evaluation treatment difficult . Consequently , comparative study different treatment strategy heart failure cardiac surgery sparse give magnitude problem . Natriuretic peptide extensively study cardiology . In patient chronic heart failure markedly increase BNP NT-pro BNP level associate poor prognosis . The response natriuretic peptide heart failure treatment significant prognostic implication , non-responders poor prognosis . In cardiac surgery NT-proBNP increase pronounce patient require inotropes . High postoperative level BNP NT-proBNP associate bad outcome , short- long-term . The first GLUTAMICS-trial permit blind prospective evaluation NT-proBNP clinical end-points committee rely strict prespecified criterion regard postoperative heart failure . Data publish demonstrate postoperative NT-proBNP ( day 1 day 3 ) level strong predictor severe heart failure associate extend ICU stay death . This imply postoperative NT-proBNP could serve measure assess efficacy treatment preventive strategy postoperative heart failure . Albeit , surrogate marker postoperative heart failure provide advantage standardize objective analysis , make study reproducible . AIM The aim confirm finding subgroup first GLUTAMICS-trial intravenous glutamate infusion reduces risk postoperative heart failure moderate high risk patient undergo coronary artery surgery show reduced increase NT-proBNP postoperatively . PATIENTS Patients accepted coronary artery bypass surgery least two vessel disease leave main stenosis without concomitant procedure consider moderate high surgical risk preoperatively regard postoperative heart failure . 310 patient plan include informed write consent . Exclusion criterion : patient ambiguous food allergy trigger shortness breath , headache flushing ; patient &gt; 85 year , previous cardiac surgery , patient bad condition ask participate , patient linguistic reason unable provide inform consent , severe renal failure preoperative dialysis calculate GFR &lt; 30 mL / min , patient require inotropic drug mechanical circulatory support ( intra-aortic balloon pump ) due circulatory failure even enrol study , patient undergo surgery without heart-lung machine ( off-pump ) , patient undergo concomitant Maze-procedure surgery ascend aorta . STUDY DESIGN The GLUTAMICS II investigator initiate prospective , randomize , placebo control , double-blind trial parallel assignment glutamate placebo ( saline ) . The trial externally randomize randomization stratify patient undergo isolated CABG CABG concomitant procedure . INTERVENTION Patients randomly allocate blind intravenous infusion 0.125M L-glutamic acid solution saline rate 1.65 ml/kg hour commence 20 minute release aortic cross-clamp . The infusion continue two hour declamping aorta additional 50 ml give halved infusion rate . PRIMARY ENDPOINT The primary endpoint postoperative increase NT-proBNP day surgery third postoperative day . SECONDARY ENDPOINTS Secondary endpoint absolute postoperative plasma level NT-proBNP day 1 day 3 . SAFETY VARIABLES Postoperative mortality ( 30 day + hospital ) , stroke within 24 hour SUSARs SAMPLE SIZE Sample size base available result first GLUTAMICS study . In study , follow increase NT-proBNP preoperative value third postoperative day ( mean ± SD ) observe patient LVEF ≤ 0.30 EuroSCORE II ≥ 3.0 undergoing coronary artery surgery without concomitant procedure . Glutamate ( n=71 ) : 5261 ± 4409 Placebo ( n=62 ) : 7112 ± 6454 Sample size assessment external statistical expertise ( 80 % power , 5 % risk level ; two-sided test ) suggest 141 patient group . To account failed sampling loss plan total 310 patient . INTERIM ANALYSIS Interim analysis perform external independent statistician 160 patient adaptive design report detail Swedish Medical Product Agency . ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS A concern use glutamate may act excitotoxin certain condition participate event lead neurological damage . However , brain tissue concentration glutamate fifty-fold high blood whereas dosage use elevates blood level three-fold . Neurological outcome carefully monitor intravenous infusion use clinical practice without evidence adverse effect . No evidence subclinical neurological injury associate intravenous glutamate infusion could detect S-100B measurement differences neurological outcome adverse event find GLUTAMICS trial . After write informed consent eligible patient enrol study . The study perform accord Helsinki Declaration Human Rights approve Regional Ethical Review Board Linköping ( Dnr 2011/498-31 ; Dnr 2015/333-32 ) . The Swedish Medical Products Agency request surveillance unblinding case CT-verified stroke within 24 hour surgery , mortality suspect unexpected serious adverse reaction ( SUSAR ) . External monitoring key data , write informed consent unblinding procedure do .</detailed_description>
