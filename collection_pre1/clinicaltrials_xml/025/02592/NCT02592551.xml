	<brief_title>MEDI4736 Or MEDI4736 + Tremelimumab In Surgically Resectable Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects MPM undergo surgical mediastinal lymph node biopsy ( cervical mediastinoscopy ) simultaneous surgical biopsy pleural tumor thoracoscopy , time tumor tissue ( least 2 g ) peripheral blood collect study . These procedure perform standard care treatment subject . One three week biopsy , subject randomly treat either MEDI-4736 ( 15 mg/kg intravenously ) MEDI-4736 ( 1500 mg intravenously ) plus tremelimumab ( 75 mg intravenously ) control group randomize control study design . There two treatment arm ( MEDI4736 combination MEDI4736+tremelimumab ) one untreated arm ( control ) . Randomization , stratify receive previous chemotherapy , perform help minimize patient selection bias three arm . Subjects 30 kg treat weight-based dosing MEDI4736 Tremelimumab combination therapy . These patient exclude fix base dose limit endotoxin exposure drug preparation . Two six week infusion , subject undergo resectional surgery , include extrapleural pneumonectomy ( EPP ) pleurectomy/decortication ( P/D ) , time tumor remove ( typically 200-1000 g ) obtain study . Four patient undergo treatment MEDI-4736 tremelimumab include control . Blood obtain induction general anesthesia thoracoscopy procedure EPP P/D resectional procedure , routinely do procedure . The sixth rib obtain time resection . After removal tumor , standard protocol include intraoperative heat chemotherapy use lavage intracavitary cisplatin presence conserve renal function ( Sugarbaker et al. , 2013 , 2014 ; Richards et al. , 2006 ) .</detailed_description>
