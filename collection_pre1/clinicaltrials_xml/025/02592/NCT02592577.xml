	<brief_summary>This first time human study intend men woman least 18 year age advance lung cancer grown return treat . In particular , study subject blood test positive HLA-A*02:01 and/or HLA-A*02:06 tumor test positive MAGE A10 protein expression ( protein gene ) . The study take subject 's T cell , natural type immune cell blood , send laboratory modify . The changed T cell use study subject 's T cell genetically change aim attack destroy cancer cell . The manufacturing T cell take 1 month complete . The T cell give back subject intravenous infusion . The purpose study test safety genetically change T cell find effect , , subject lung cancer . The study evaluate three different cell dose level order find target cell dose . Once target cell dose determine , additional subject enrol test safety effect cell dose . Subjects see frequently Study Physician right receive T cell back first 6 month . After , subject see every three month . If subject disease progression withdraw study , enter long-term follow safety monitoring . Subjects see every 6 month Study Physician first 5 year T cell infusion . If T cell find blood five year , subject continue see year T cell longer find blood maximum 15 year . If T cell longer find blood 5 year , subject contact Study Physician next 10 year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This first time human study single-arm study genetically engineer MAGE A10ᶜ⁷⁹⁶T cell HLA-A*02:01 and/or HLA-A*02:06 positive subject advance ( Stage IIIb IV ) NSCLC . Subjects measurable disease screen general health , performance status disease stage . Following screening , subject meet eligibility undergo large-volume leukapheresis obtain cell manufacture autologous MAGE A10ᶜ⁷⁹⁶TCR bear T cell . When MAGE A10ᶜ⁷⁹⁶T cell available , subject receive lymphodepleting chemotherapy cyclophosphamide fludarabine Days -7 , Day -6 , Day -5 follow T cell infusion Day 1 . This trial dose escalation trial evaluate 3 dos transduce cell administer lymphodepleting chemotherapy regimen use 3+3 dose escalation design . The dos cell dose group follow . Group 1a 1b : 0.1 x 10⁹ ( range : 0.08 x 10⁹-0.12 x 10⁹ ) transduce cell . Group 2 : 1 x 10⁹ ( range : 0.8 x 10⁹- 1.2 x 10⁹ ) transduce cell . Group 3 : 5 x 10⁹ ( range : 1 x 10⁹- 6 x 10⁹ ) transduce cell . There 21-day staggering treatment treat subject Group 1 7-day stagger treat subject Groups 2 3 . NOTE : If DLT occur Group 1 Group 2 require expansion group ( n=6 ) , 14-day stagger would implement Group 2 3 , respectively . The study enroll 12-24 subject evaluate DLTs determine target dose . The sample size target cell dose may expand 10 subject characterize safety preliminary evidence antitumor activity . Subjects visit clinic safety assessment daily T cell infusion ( Day 1 ) Day 5 , Days 8 , 10 , 12 , weekly week 6 8 , 10 , 12 , 16 , 20 24 week , every 3 month 2 year every 6 month progression disease ( withdrawal consent interventional portion study ) . Subjects confirm response ( stable disease &gt; 4 month ) subsequent disease progression follow initial infusion whose tumor continue express appropriate antigen target may eligible second infusion . All subject , complete withdraw Interventional Phase study , enter 15-year long-term follow-up phase observation delay adverse event . All subject continue follow overall survival long-term follow-up phase .</detailed_description>
