	<brief_summary>The primary goal study patient recurrent Clostridium difficile Infection ( CDI ) treat lyophilized Fecal Microbiota Transplantation ( FMT ) open-labelled controlled trial . The treatment failure rate evaluate define persistence diarrhea positive C. difficile toxin assay . The safety , clinical response , relapse rate patient assess .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Prospective Trial Lyophilized Fecal Microbiota Transplantation Recurrent Clostridium Difficile Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recurrence CDI follow course standard antibiotic therapy high , especially elderly patient 65 year age , hospitalize immunocompromised patient . As CDI characterize intestinal dysbiosis . Fecal Microbiology Transplantation ( FMT ) investigate alternative treatment CDI determine effective safe . One major challenge offer FMT availability suitable donor . A donor may longer able continue donate number reason may lead temporary interruption FMT center offer program . In order continue offer FMT whenever need , investigate efficacy lyophilize FMT . The lyophilization ( freeze-drying ) process work dehydrate frozen donor stool sample complete dryness , use control temperature pressure gradient . This lyophilized process result powder form sample . Studies show lyophilized donor stool sample similar microbial composition fresh sample.The technique freeze dry use decade industrial storage microbe use . Preliminary study lyophilize stool FMT perform dog . Preliminary efficacy data dog inflammatory bowel disease suggest equal efficacy compare fresh stool , although control study yet perform . Should lyophilize FMT ( L-FMT ) demonstrate equally effective frozen FMT , would significant advantage . As frozen FMT , lyophilize FMT allow patient receive FMT immediately take two week donor 's screen laboratory test result available . Lyophilized FMT also cost effective less number donor need screen give prolong shelf life lyophilize FMT keep freezing temperature . 9 This also allow wider distribution accessibility especially region limited capacity manufacture FMT .</detailed_description>
