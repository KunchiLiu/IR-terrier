	<brief_title>Effect Bolus Clonidine Systemically Administered Excitability Spinal Motoneurons Lower Extremity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>According literature data , intraoperative administration clonidine reduces need morphine per postoperative thus reduces side effect associate related administration . Nevertheless , basis current knowledge , clonidine may disrupt electrophysiological measure require intraoperative monitoring surgery high risk neurological complication . For surgery , anaesthesiologists lead inject clonidine surgery , time electrophysiological measure longer need , limit benefit term intraoperative morphine saving . Whith study , investigator would like investigate early administration clonidine patient age 6 16 year undergoing ear surgery disturbs excitability spinal motor neuron . The choice study population justify fact ear surgery require electrophysiological monitoring carry condition similar anesthesia scoliosis corrective surgery electrophysiological measurement essential prevention neurological complication . Observations allow investigator determine therefore whether early administration clonidine possible high risk neurological complication surgery electrophysiological monitoring essential .</detailed_description>
