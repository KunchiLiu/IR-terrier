	<brief_summary>This feasibility study test use epidural stimulation restore volitional function previously lose due spinal cord injury . Previous study conduct animal model , perform elsewhere Mayo Clinic , show direct electrical stimulation spinal cord increase excitability spar neuronal connection within site injury , thereby enhance signal transmission allow recovery previously lose volitional function . Recently , epidural electrical stimulation lumbosacral spinal cord four individual spinal cord injury ( SCI ) restore motor autonomic function level injury . Despite positive result , translational research need validate finding . The goal proposal perform epidural stimulation restore volitional function patient SCI . In two patient , implant epidural stimulator onto dorsal aspect lumbosacral spinal cord dura mater . Patients undergo structured program daily physical rehabilitation , treadmill step training , epidural stimulation recover motor , sensory , autonomic function .</brief_summary>
