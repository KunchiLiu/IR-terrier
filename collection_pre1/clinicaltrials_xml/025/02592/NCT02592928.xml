	<brief_summary>Background/Aims There evidence indicate deployment force spirometry ( FS ) test collaborative scenario , encompass respiratory specialist community professional , generates healthcare efficiency . The study describe roadmap regional implementation FS program Catalonia ( ES ) , January December 2016 . Methods/Design Firstly , FS program deploy three healthcare sector ( 514 k inhabitant ) , follow Plan-Do-Study-Act iterative cycle , use Model Assessment Telemedicine evaluation purpose . Thereafter , regional deployment FS program ( 7.5M inhabitant ) conduct . The third step considers : evaluation transferability , preparation data analytics recommendation long-term assessment outcome . Main component FS program : ) Automatic quality test ; ii ) Standardized data transfer share electronic health record ; iii ) Elaboration individual FS report include historical result ; , iv ) Clinical decision support system provide access FS report , remote support upon request . Discussion/Conclusions The project constitute first attempt scale-up collaborative scenario FS test open new avenue longitudinal lung function assessment . Moreover , set show high potential transferability different site diagnostic procedure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Forced Spirometry program emerge series study report technological solution main component indicate potential articulated application aim cover unmet need collaborative FS testing . The study initiate within EU project NEXES22 ; 23 specific part overall set already successfully evaluate Basque Country . The setting &amp; Study design The current protocol design part regional deployment integrate care service Catalonia . It consist two line activity ultimately aim : ) regional adoption FS program ; , ii ) generalization approach area , well test procedure . The research submit apoved Ethical Committee Hospital Clínic Provincial de Barcelona . Program deployment The initial 6 month include three healthcare sector : Lleida ( 168k inhabitant 21 Primary Care center ) , Vic ( 49k inhabitant 11 PCC ) , Atenció Integral en Salut Barcelona Esquerra ( AISBE ) ( 540k inhabitant 19 PCC ) follow Plan-Do-Study-Act ( PDSA ) methodology24 . The first PDSA cycle ( January - March 2016 ) include total three primary care center , one healthcare sector , main purpose ensure full functionality set . Immediately thereafter , FS program progressively deploy Primary Care center three sector second 3-months PDSA cycle complete mid-2016 . Forced spirometry test prescribe attend general practitioner follow standard criterion carry primary care nurse . The deployment program entire region ( 7.5M inhabitant 369 Primary Care center ) complete discontinuation within 2016 . It follow identical PDSA methodology . The outcomes assessment carry PDSA cycle modulate long-term assessment strategy FS program described .</detailed_description>
