	<brief_summary>Introduction : An emerge body evidence indicate association air pollution exposure pregnancy adverse pregnancy outcome ( Rudra , Williams , Sheppard , Koenig , &amp; Schiff , 2011 ; Dadvand , et al. , 2013 ; Ritz , et al. , 2014 ) . Adverse pregnancy outcome tend lead adverse neonatal outcome high economic cost . Epidemiologic study also reveal cardiovascular complication pregnancy , al preeclampsia , associate great cardiovascular risk later life ( Abramson &amp; Melvin , 2014 ) . Aim : This study want examine effect exposure environmental factor , polluents particulate matter clinical pregnancy outcome mother child determine biochemical change maternal , placental cord blood best explain effect . Methods : This study perform prospective cohort setup ( n=200 ) , recruit prenatal clinic University Hospital Antwerp . The data collection consist four questionnaire ( intake , urine sample postpartum ) , two blood sample ( 28 week post-partum ) , two urine sample ( 20 30 week ) , two hair sample ( 20 week post-partum ) , cord blood placenta . Results conclusion : As study start November 2014 , result available yet .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Blood collection ( maternal umbilical cord ) Venous blood drawn around 24 week gestational age . Table 1 Tests maternal blood sample : Routine blood sampling ( UZA ) Urea , Creatinin , CRP , LDH , AST , ALT , Uric acid , APTT , PT , Fibrinogen , D-dimers , Glucose , Erythrocytes/hematocrit , Hemoglobin , Thrombocytes , Leukocytes , Ferritin , Toxoplasmosis ( IgG &amp; IgM ) , CMV ( IgG &amp; IgM ) , Herpes simplex IgG , Varicella zoster IgG , Rubella IgG , Parvovirus ( IgG &amp; IgM ) , Syphilis ( RPR &amp; TPHAM ) , Indirect Coombs AML sFlt-1 , PlGF , Cystatin C VITO ( ) RNA expression , telomere length , DNA methylation Umbilical cord blood take time birth . Table 2 Tests umbilical blood sample VITO ( ) RNA expression , telomere length , DNA methylation Urine collection Urine sample take pregnant woman , minimum 8 hour fast ( morning urine ) . Samples hand midwife antenatal visit , place -20Â°C freezer within 12 hour collection . Analysis perform Flemish Institute Technological Research ( VITO ) . Two urine sample collect : 20 week 30 week gestational age . 8 oxo deoxyguanosine determine sample . Hair collection Hair sample draw midwife around 24 week gestational age three day delivery . Long period stress associate increase hair cortisol concentration ( Stalder &amp; Kirschbaum , 2012 ) . Confounding variable low maternal education , season delivery , smoke pregnancy obesity ( Braig , et al. , 2015 ) .Titanium scissors clean denaturated ethanol midwife wear disposable glove order limit contamination . A lock hair thickness match ( 2 mm ) length 4 cm take put envelope . Analysis perform University Southern Denmark . Collection particulate matter bedroom window Participants ask clean bedroom window clear water in- outside around 24 week gestation . A poster ( A4 format ) attach window create standardize area measurement magnetic particle . After minimal 4 week , area poster clean sterile pre-injection swab , side window . Swabs transport plastic bag ferro ( ) magnetic particulate matter fraction quantify Saturated Isothermal Remanent Magnetization . Questionnaires There four different questionnaire : Questionnaire general habit , socio-economic factor , lifestyle eat habit A self-designed questionnaire use extensively collect information ethnic origin education level , employment , income work environment , family history diseases chronic disorder , eat habit , previous pregnancy habit ( smoking , alcohol consumption ) . Questionnaire lifestyle previous 3 day A self-designed questionnaire use extensively collect information contact possible toxic factor eat pattern previous 3 day . Questionnaire residential facts A self-designed questionnaire use collect information exact location bedroom window possible factor influence concentration particulate matter . Questionnaire stress factor birth facts A self-designed questionnaire use extensively collect information stress level pregnancy , birth fact medication pregnancy . Questionnaires take different visit : &lt; 12 week 20 week 30 week birth Questionnaire general habit , socio-economic factor , lifestyle eat habit Recruitment Questionnaire lifestyle previous 3 day Urine sample 1 Urine sample 2 Questionnaire residential fact 4-8 week prior visit Questionnaire stress factor birth fact 3 day birth</detailed_description>
