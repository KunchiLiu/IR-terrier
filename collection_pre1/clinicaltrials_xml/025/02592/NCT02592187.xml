	<brief_summary>Background : Mild Cognitive Impairment ( MCI ) risk factor dementia represent critical window opportunity intervene alter trajectory cognitive functional decline . Emerging life-logging technology show tremendous potential increase autobiographical memory . Objective : The main goal present study develop Cognitive Training program ( CT ) MCI base life-logging capture Wearable Camera ( WeC ) record specific autobiographical episode stimulate posteriorly episodic memory . The challenge create application manage large collection image , easily retrieve event user therapeutic context multimodal cognitive stimulation . The investigator conduct first pilot Randomized Controlled Trial ( RCT ) evaluate effectiveness life-logging re-experiencing program immediately 3-month follow-up period . Methodology : The Design single blind RCT CT base life-logging tool . 30 adult MCI , completion two week image collection WeC , randomly allocate ( 1:1 ) experimental control group . Once acquire episodic individual 's video , participant attend 1-hour individual training session 2 time per week 14 week . Main outcomes measure cognitive , functional , emotional quality life measure , well biochemical measure ( BDNF ) . Expected result : The investigator expect outcome provide preliminary evidence autobiographical experimentation CT program positively impact cognitive functioning may represent effective strategy improve memory functionality begin experience cognitive decline .</brief_summary>
