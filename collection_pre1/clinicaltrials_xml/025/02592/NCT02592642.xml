	<brief_summary>Arthritis spine cause narrow spinal canal compression spinal nerve travel leg , limit walk ability . The vast majority individual arthritis spine suit surgery receive non-surgical treatment . However , know non-surgical treatment effective improve walk people . The purpose research test four new treatment arthritis spine see improve walk ability . Each treatment approach focus change occur spine whole person result arthritis directly indirectly impact ability walk perform usual daily activity . Because arthritis spine chronic condition usually go away , important people acquire knowledge , skill , tool manage condition . The treatment investigator plan test part research proposal aim achieve goal . However , investigator promote use treatment need formally test use strict scientific method make sure good harm . The four treatment include 1 ) six week train program refer `` Boot Camp Stenosis '' provide one-on-one training exercise self-management strategy 2 ) patient educational workbook video self-manage , 3 ) electrical device place low back reduce nerve pain walk 4 ) spinal stenosis belt people wear reduce pressure nerve walk . The plan assess change walk distance use various treatment assess impact treatment people ' overall function quality life . Innovative treatment approach long term perspective urgently need deal grow number people arthritis spine disable . It likely one solution problem - many people require one type treatment , important first step determine treatment effective , tailor treatment need person .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Four Non-operative Treatments Degenerative Lumbar Spinal Stenosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis ( DLSS ) osteoarthritis spine lead cause pain , disability , loss independence old adult . It chronic disease cause age related degenerative narrowing ( stenosis ) spinal canal lead compression ischemia spinal nerve ( neuro-ischemia ) . The clinical syndrome DLSS know neurogenic claudication . It characterize bilateral unilateral buttock and/or low extremity pain , heaviness , numbness , tingle weakness , precipitate walk stand relieve sit bend forward . Limited walk ability dominant functional impairment cause DLSS . Those afflicted great walk limitation individual knee hip osteoarthritis great functional limitation congestive heart failure , chronic obstructive lung disease systemic lupus erythematosus . Inability walk among individual DLSS lead sedentary lifestyle progressive decline health status . The prevalence economic burden DLSS grow exponentially due age population . Although DLSS common reason spine surgery individual age 65 , DLSS patient receive surgery . The vast majority individual DLSS receive non-surgical care . However , constitutes effective non-surgical care unknown . Self-management strategy may practical effective mean improve walk ability , functional status , quality life chronic arthritic often progressive condition . The investigator conduct two systematic review literature , one assess effectiveness non-surgical treatment neurogenic claudication include randomize control trial ( RCTs ) assess improvement pain , disability , quality life global improvement ; evaluate effectiveness surgical non-surgical intervention include RCTs assess improved walking ability . investigator learn review evidence intervention improve outcome include walk ability neurogenic claudication due DLSS lacking . The evidence publish thus far topic low low quality , prohibit formulation evidence-based recommendation clinical practice . Moreover , investigator identify RCTs examine self-management approach treatment DLSS . In addition structural arthritic change cause narrow spinal canal , DLSS important dynamic component . The volume spinal canal degree epidural pressure ischemia spinal nerve change depend spinal posture . Both lumbar flexion ( stoop forward ) , sit increase diameter canal reduce spinal nerve ischemia , correspond reduction elimination low extremity symptom . Conversely , lumbar extension increase lumbar lordosis ( occurs stand ) reduces diameter spinal canal increase spinal nerve ischemia , corresponds increase low extremity symptom . The ability reduce symptom DLSS change spinal posture/structural alignment and/or increase blood flow spinal nerve provide potential mechanism develop intervention improve symptom walk ability . First , investigator design implement novel six week self-management training program DLSS past 3 year Spinal Stenosis Clinic Rebecca MacDonald Centre Arthritis Auto-immune Diseases Mount Sinai Hospital ( MSH ) . The goal training program provide patient knowledge , skill , self-confidence , physical capacity manage symptom maximize function . The program multi-modal , tailor directed structural , functional , physiological psychosocial consequence DLSS . Particular emphasis place exercise instruction build core low extremity strength enable individual achieve optimal posture stand walk . There numerous human study demonstrate significant reduction laboratory induce ischemic pain low upper extremity paraspinal TENS compare placebo TENS . Moreover , low quality evidence one case series suggest electrical stimulation may effective management neurogenic claudication . Higher quality study need assess whether paraspinal TENS apply walk improves walk ability , could innovative , convenient , inexpensive self-management strategy DLSS patient . Finally , investigator design prototype spinal stenosis belt Ontario College Art Design . The belt design garment snugly fit sacrum pelvic girdle pump place pressure sacrum aim reduce lumbar lordosis maximize spinal canal diameter walking . The investigator hypothesize belt reduce lumbar lordosis alleviate epidural pressure neuro-ischemia standing walking . The investigator identify two preliminary study evaluate back belt , support brace DLSS , none RCTs . These study find significant improvement walk distance use back corset ; however study high risk bias . OBJECTIVES AND HYPOTHESES The overall goal study assess effectiveness four self-management strategy improve walk ability among patient DLSS . The investigator primary objective compare effectiveness comprehensive six week self-management training program include patient instructional workbook , video pedometer patient workbook , video pedometer alone . The investigator secondary objective : 1 ) compare change walk capacity baseline use superficially apply para-spinal TENS versus placebo para-spinal TENS apply walk 2 ) compare change walk capacity baseline wear novel spinal stenosis belt use sham spinal stenosis belt walk . The investigator hypothesize self-management training program workbook , video pedometer effective improve walk capacity functional outcome use workbook , video pedometer alone . Furthermore , investigator hypothesize para-spinal TENS novel spinal stenosis belt use walk effective improve walk capacity placebo TENS sham spinal stenosis belt , respectively .</detailed_description>
