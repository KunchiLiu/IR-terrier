	<brief_title>Efficacy Study Of Tofacitinib In Pediatric JIA Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize withdrawal , double blind , placebo control study pediatric subject ( 2 &lt; 18 year age ) JIA . The primary objective compare efficacy tofacitinib versus placebo treatment sign symptom JIA Week 26 double blind phase measure percentage subject disease flare ( accord PRCSG/PRINTO Disease Flare criterion ) Week 18 open label run phase.All eligible subject enrol study initially receive open label tofacitinib 18 week ( run phase ) . At end 18 week run phase , subject achieve least JIA ACR 30 response randomize 26 week double blind , placebo control phase . Subjects achieve JIA ACR 30 response time point discontinue study . In addition , subject experience single episode disease flare time study ( include open label run double blind phase ) also discontinue study . All subject participate study , include discontinue study , option , eligible ( base inclusion exclusion criterion ) , enrol tofacitinib JIA long term extension study ( A3921145 ) . Subjects eligible 26 week double blind phase randomize ( 1:1 ratio ) either active tofacitinib placebo . For subject polyarticular course JIA ( ie , extend oligoarthritis , polyarthritis RF+ , polyarthritis RF , systemic JIA active arthritis without active systemic feature ) , randomization stratify JIA category baseline CRP ( normal , normal ) . For subject psoriatic enthesitis relate arthritis , randomization stratify JIA category . Approximately 210 subject enrol open label run phase . Among subject polyarticular course JIA , stratification target least 50 % baseline CRP upper limit normal . The first cohort ( ie , polyarticular course JIA ) least 170 subject enrol run phase minimum number JIA category follow : 24 extend oligoarthritis , 20 polyarthritis RF+ , 62 polyarthritis RF- , 20 systemic JIA active arthritis without active systemic feature . Additional cohort ( ie , psoriatic enthesitis relate arthritis ) include minimum 20 subject psoriatic arthritis , 20 subject enthesitis related arthritis . The overall target minimum number subject enrol study age follow : 20 subject 2 &lt; 6 year , 20 subject 6 &lt; 12 year , 20 subject 12 &lt; 18 year . The duration subject participation among complete study ( without discontinuation ) expect approximately 44 week .</detailed_description>
