	<brief_summary>Despite recent advance treatment post-menopausal hormone receptor-positive BC , last decade major improvement hormonal therapy specifically premenopausal metastatic breast cancer . The median age breast cancer much young , proportion young breast cancer ( YBC ) patient ( less 40 ) include premenopausal woman much high , Asia , include Korea . Capecitabine , comparator trial , orally-administered fluoropyrimidine derivative show high efficacy low toxicity metastatic breast cancer patient . Palbociclib CDK4/6 inhibitor , combination endocrine therapy show marked advance hormone receptor-positive MBC post-menopausal setting . After median follow-up 16.5 month , preliminary result Part 1 Phase 2 trial suggest combination PD-0332991 letrozole superior letrozole alone , improve objective response disease control rate ( 52 % vs 32 % 76 % vs 47 % , respectively ) patient treat combination . These remarkable result may contribute much benefit endocrine therapy premenopausal woman . Most importantly , recent PALOMA-3 trial reveal superior result add palbociclib fulvestrant ( median PFS 9.2 v 3.8 month , P &lt; 0.001 ) . Based rational background , purpose phase II study ass safety clinical anti-tumor activity exemestane plus goserelin acetate combination palbociclib v capecitabine premenopausal hormone receptor-positive advanced breast cancer patient</brief_summary>
