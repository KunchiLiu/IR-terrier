	<brief_summary>This study address important public health concern ; impoverish cognitive function associate treatment breast cancer . Due increase awareness breast cancer combine advance medical care , 2.8 million woman live history breast cancer U.S. alone . Chemotherapy adjuvant therapy remove cancerous tissue result deficit attention , speed processing , memory , quality life . Physical activity associate number health benefit breast cancer survivor include improvement cognitive function . However , literature cross-sectional unclear whether acute ( single ) bouts physical activity affect cognition , , long effect last . This study first , investigator ' knowledge , examine effect acute bout aerobic exercise cognitive function breast cancer survivor . Specifically , investigator determine effect 30-minute moderate intensity aerobic exercise session ( treadmill walk ) immediate one hour follow change measure process speed , memory , executive function . Additionally , accelerometer cut-points physical activity intensity breast cancer survivor assess . Finally , investigator examine association cardiorespiratory fitness physical activity change cognitive function . Findings study allow researcher determine whether acute effect exercise cognition retain time therefore real mean context one 's daily life .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study address important public health concern : impoverish cognitive function associate treatment breast cancer . Due increase awareness breast cancer combine advance medical care , 5-year survival rate climb 89.2 % 2.8 million woman live history breast cancer U.S. alone . Unfortunately , treatment breast cancer without consequence . Chemotherapy adjuvant therapy remove cancerous tissue result deficit attention , speed processing , memory , quality life . While past study identify memory executive function valuable , important determinant long-term survival quality life survivor different type cancer , unclear standard care method alone prove successful attenuating decline variable . Previous research breast cancer population find executive function difficulty , namely work memory , cognitive flexibility , process speed , well fatigue , commonly describe deficit . Furthermore , evidence suggest impairment cognitive functioning may persist 35 % breast cancer survivor year treatment end . A behavioral lifestyle modality know improve physical mental health status protect health decline physical activity . Not physical activity know protect host disease , also show provide many health benefit breast cancer survivor . While extant literature suggest physical activity lead improvement vary cognitive domain breast cancer survivor , another study conclude 32 % survivor meet recommend guideline physical activity . Additionally , benefit physical activity breast cancer survivor well know , currently scientifically recognize physical activity training program aim improve cognitive function cohort . As , review chapter examine cognitive impairment breast cancer survivor suggest comprehensive study examine relationship objective measure physical activity , cardiorespiratory fitness , cognitive performance warrant gain well understand potentially protective effect fitness physical activity cognitive function breast cancer survivor well survival along cancer continuum . In addition , research show subjective memory impairment , fatigue , anxiety plague breast cancer survivor suggest breast cancer survivor may suffer poor quality life result . Furthermore , show breast cancer survivor longer reaction time work memory task compare healthy , age-matched control , survivor high level physical activity shorter reaction time difficult task . A recent study also measure level objective physical activity find high level displayed positive measure global cognition . Despite evidence , unknown acute ( single ) bout exercise provide benefit vary cognitive domain . Previous research show acute bout aerobic physical activity , light moderate intensity , decrease state anxiety breast cancer survivor . However , know benefit extend cognitive functioning . Furthermore , result found cross-sectional research unclear whether acute bout physical activity improve cognition , , long effect last . This implication real world context , benefit present , breast cancer survivor find relief cognitive symptom quickly simply engage bout physical activity . This study first , investigator ' knowledge , examine effect acute bout aerobic exercise cognitive function breast cancer survivor .</detailed_description>
