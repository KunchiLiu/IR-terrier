	<brief_summary>The purpose neoadjuvant trial evaluate efficacy toxicity cdk 4/6 inhibitor palbociclib add standard endocrine treatment . Initially , patient receive endocrine treatment 4 week . In case decrease proliferation ( Ki67 ) patient randomize either continuous endocrine therapy ( arm A ) treatment addition palbociclib ( arm B ) . Patients change proliferation allocate endocrine treatment + palbociclib without randomization ( arm C ) . During 12-weekly treatment period , clinical radiological evaluation perform repeatedly . Switch treatment arm A B allow case lack response due toxicity . A translational subprotocol mandatory part study protocol , except use PET-CT evaluation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pre- perimenopausal woman treat tamoxifen , alternatively LHRH analogue combination aromatase inhibitor ( woman ) . Postmenopausal woman receive aromatase inhibitor.This treatment give 4 week . In case uncertain menopausal status ( previous hysterectomy equivocal gonadotropin ) , postmenopause age limit define 55 year old . Ki67 determine FNA core biopsy start 2 week treatment . After initial 4-week period , patient sign response term decrease Ki67 ≥20 % randomized endocrine treatment either alone combination cdk 4/6 inhibitor palbociclib ( arm A B ) . Patients tumor stable disease , define &lt; 20 % decrease increase Ki67 without radiological indication tumor progression 4-week evaluation offer continuous endocrine treatment addition palbociclib ( arm C ) . Dose regimen 4 week endocrine pretreatment : Arm A : Pre- perimenopausal woman treat tamoxifen , alternatively LHRH analogue combination aromatase inhibitor ( woman ) . Postmenopausal woman receive aromatase inhibitor . The preoperative treatment continue 12 week , provide re-evaluation 6 10 week preoperative treatment indicate progression . Upon progression ( PD ) , individualized management , preferentially surgery , primary option . Arm B : Patients receive endocrine treatment arm A together palbociclib 125 mg orally day 1-21 , follow 7-days rest period . The combined treatment continue 12 week , re-evaluation 6 week , week 10 preoperative treatment , indicate progression . Upon progression ( PD ) , individualized management , preferentially surgery , primary option . Arm C : Treatment accord schedule describe arm B. Postoperative chemotherapy recommend patient either residual lymph node metastases &gt; 2mm ( macro metastasis ) primary tumor size &gt; 30mm combination Ki67 &gt; 15 % . Adjuvant endocrine treatment radiotherapy offer accord standard guideline . Structured follow-up visit yearly five year include report persistent treatment-related toxicity , HRQoL , recurrence death . All patient recommend adjuvant endocrine treatment least 5 year . The trial contains also translational subprotocol : 1 . PET-CT use FDG , confine chest , perform start first treatment period 10 week , i.e . 6 week treatment allocation ( functional imaging , optional ) . 2 . Core biopsy tumor collected start first treatment period 10 week , i.e . 6 week treatment allocation . Further tissue sample collect surgical specimen . 3 . Blood sample collect repeatedly ongoing treatment yearly follow-up . 4 . FNAs metastases case recurrence follow-up .</detailed_description>
