	<brief_title>A Case Control Observational Study Assess CYDAR Automated Overlay Guidance During EVAR</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aorta main artery body . An aortic abdominal aneurysm ( AAA ) define abnormal dilatation aorta , base diameter 3 cm , due weakness aortic wall prone rupture , lead lifethreatening condition . Once AAA diagnose , CTscan require assess anatomy indicate endovascular aneurysm repair ( EVAR ) perform . This mini invasive procedure allow exclusion AAA positioning endograft inside aorta femoral access live Xrays ( fluoroscopy ) guidance . The Xrays good showing bone radioopaque endovascular tool , show soft tissue like aorta , produce flat ( 2D ) image superimpose 3D anatomical feature . In order see aorta , physician inject iodinate contrast high quality image record . One way improve clinician ' perception peroperative 3D vascular anatomy accurately overlay select information preoperative CT scan ( 3D vascular mask ) onto live Xray image create '3D roadmap ' . This advanced imaging application currently available late expensive hybrid room . This trial examine clinical benefit first advance imaging application allow automate 3D overlay guidance EVAR theatre . The software , combine secure certify cloud high performance computing , deduce patient position compare bony anatomy visible Xray patient 's CT scan , enable produce update accurate reliable overlay diagnostic CT 3D vascular mask throughout operation ( www.cydar.co.uk ) . Expected benefit include reduce total Xray exposure patient staff , reduce use iodinate contrast ( major cause kidney failure ) shortening procedure duration .</detailed_description>
