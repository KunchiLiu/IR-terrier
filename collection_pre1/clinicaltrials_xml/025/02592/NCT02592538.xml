	<brief_summary>Endobiliary radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) biliary stent report beneficial treatment option palliation malignant biliary stricture . RFA use high-frequency alternate current generate heat achieve coagulative necrosis contact tissue . Within bile duct , RFA appear safe may result decreased tumor ingrowth . However , therapeutic effect expect delay bile duct obstruction rather decrease tumor . Recently orally available chemotherapeutic agent , S-1 , oral fluoropyrimidine , report effective patient bile duct adenocarcinoma . To date , little known role addition systemic chemotherapy RFA cholangiocarcinoma . The aim study evaluate combine effect RFA S-1 patient unresectable cholangiocarcinoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Endobiliary Radiofrequency Ablation With S-1 Unresectable Cholangiocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over 60 % common bile duct ( CBD ) obstruction due malignancy , majority neoplasms unresectable time diagnosis . Biliary drainage placement metal plastic stent palliation therapy choice set patient . Radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) well establish method treatment solid tumor , like liver cancer , lung cancer , etc . Recently , endoscopically applicable radiofrequency probe , HabibTM EndoHBP catheter , approve clinical use . RFA use high-frequency alternate current generate heat achieve coagulative necrosis contact tissue . Many study show RFA biliary stent beneficial treatment option palliation malignant biliary stricture . However , therapeutic effect expect delay bile duct obstruction rather decrease tumor . Recently orally available chemotherapeutic agent , S-1 , oral fluoropyrimidine , report effective patient bile duct adenocarcinoma . To date , little known role addition systemic chemotherapy RFA cholangiocarcinoma . The aim study conduct randomise , control , clinical trial compare effect S-1 plus RFA stent RFA stent patient unresectable cholangiocarcinoma .</detailed_description>
