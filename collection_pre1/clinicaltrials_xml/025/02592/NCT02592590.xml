	<detailed_description>The purpose propose study test efficacy individual component smartphone application design use theory human behavior promote physical activity low-active adult . Smartphones become commonplace : approximately two-thirds adult smartphone . They allow wireless internet connectivity ability communicate via voice text message time . Perhaps importantly perspective behavior change , device often carry person time . In recent year researcher attempt use device promote physical activity , continue encounter number barrier . Notably , development commercial sector far outpace standard randomize control trial ( RCT ) cycle . As result , researcher utilize RCT design find difficult publish finding relevant current technology . Additionally , approach typically examine full application include package feature , make difficult draw conclusion single intervention component . This result commercial sector produce large number physical activity application evidence base . The present study use factorial design study individual combine efficacy two theory-based module : A guided goal-setting module , points-based feedback system . If successful , result study help guide fast-moving commercial sector toward development evidence-based application , potential yield large public health impact . To test aim , adult recruit Champaign-Urbana , IL , surround community participate 12-week home-based self-guided physical activity program . Eligible individual complete baseline questionnaire inform consent online , wear activity monitor one week . Upon completion questionnaire , participant randomly assign one four condition : 1. . The Base-App ( BA ) condition ( i.e. , Group D ; name due factorial design use study ) receive base-level smartphone app contain three component common computerized behavioral intervention : physical activity-related educational content ( i.e. , weekly video , additional resource , easy weekly quiz question ) , manual physical activity tracking , instantaneous graphical feedback . As physical activity program goal-directed , individual also receive printed goal set worksheet . 2. . The BA+PT condition ( i.e. , Group C ) receive Base-App plus instantaneous points-based feedback module ( PT ) provide `` program point '' every task application ( e.g. , track physical activity , watch educational video ) , weight difficulty task . Points accumulate earn `` level '' , every fifth level bring new motivational prompt `` badge '' depict initially unfit character become increase fit . Every tenth level earn participant new `` title '' ( e.g. , `` Intermediate Exerciser '' ) . These point , level , badge , title serve provide instant positive feedback progress within program . These individual also receive printed goal set worksheet . 3. . The BA+GS condition ( i.e. , Group B ) receive Base-App plus fully guide goal-setting module ( GS ) . This module base upon health behavior theory , emphasize gradual exercise progression highly specific , realistic , measurable goal . The module guide participant set long short term goal : week , access GS module prompt revisit reset goal . At time , participant select several aerobic non-aerobic activity week , set frequency ( day per week ) duration ( minute per session ) type activity . To emphasize gradual progression , participant receive minimum , maximum , recommend frequency duration , calculate automatically within app base upon performance previous week . 4. . The BA+GS+PT condition ( i.e. , Group A ) receive application component ( i.e. , Base-App , goal setting , instantaneous feedback ) . In addition feature describe , program point accompany goal-related task ( i.e. , set goal , revisit goal , achieve goal ) . Following completion questionnaire , participant attend group-specific orientation session . During session , train research staff provide introduction smartphone application use study relevant feature , well one-on-one physical activity counsel session staff member work participant set initial aerobic non-aerobic physical activity goal . During time , participant also introduce goal-directed nature MAPS physical activity program . Short term ( i.e. , weekly ) goal specify type aerobic non-aerobic activity individual engage , well frequency duration engage activity . Each participant 's initial long-term goal reflect federal physical activity recommendation . Accordingly , participant work toward achieve 150 minute moderate intensity aerobic activity , least two day full-body muscle strengthening exercise within 12-week intervention period . Staff work participant modify long-term goal base upon participant 's current ability physical activity level . The program begin Sunday follow orientation session . On Sunday program , new educational module relate basic health health behavior concept release , participant receive brief email contain information relate weekly educational content reminder watch new video . With exception first week , email also provide specific feedback ( i.e. , minute exercise , average intensity , average enjoyment ) previous week , access guide goal set email also provide feedback advice base whether previous week 's goal meet . Finally , email prompt participant revisit short long term goal , adjust necessary . At time , participant guide goal set module bring immediately module upon enter app , ask revisit reset short term goal . This process include recommend frequency duration base upon previous performance program . Participants also prompt set new long term goal event achieve previous long term goal week . For without guided goal setting , process carry use traditional printed goal set worksheet . During week , participant utilize application feature track exercise , view feedback , review weekly goal , view educational content . On Thursday , participant receive text message update base upon progress week . For accessed app week , yet track activity week , brief prompt remind . For tracked activity , brief message provide update number session minute activity week . During final week program , participant receive activity monitor via mail ask wear one week . On completion 12-week program , participant receive email informing program complete . This email also provide link follow-up questionnaire . At time , research staff also contact participant schedule follow-up appointment , take 60 minute . During appointment , participant return activity monitor complete post-study survey assess experience MAPS program MAPS research staff .</detailed_description>
