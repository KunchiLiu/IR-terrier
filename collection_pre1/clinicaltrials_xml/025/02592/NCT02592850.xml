	<detailed_description>Background : Primary headache disorder common throughout world , produce widespread substantial disability represent concrete public-health priority . Tension-type headache ( TTH ) common type primary headache disorder , lifetime prevalence general population range 30 % 78 % different study . In general , headache chronic disorder episodic manifestation may range attacks/year daily episode . Its impact individual ' life great generally realize , include psychiatric , psychological social correlate . The impact patient high , include ictal symptom burden , interictal burden , cumulative burden impact people . The individual burden TTH include symptom occur attack ( pain , eventually accompany one phonophobia photophobia , accord International Classification Headache Disorders ) elements interictal burden , anxiety , mood disorder , affective distress avoidance behavior . While present , symptom may cause debility prostration , reduce functional ability . Even patient TTH generally unable work , effectiveness productivity may consistently reduce . This secondary disability quite significant headache general common people teens 50-60 year age , productive year . The element interictal burden , instead , may continuously affect wellbeing impair quality life . Moreover , TTH substantial impact health system , due direct indirect financial cost . The high prevalence TTH , consider individual impact huge financial cost , important implication health policy , since source high potentially reducible socioeconomic burden . Essentially , TTH management public-health priority . On clinical side , tension-type headache define multifactorial disorder , conceivably imply need tailor treatment strategy . Headache-related disability usually reduce identify avoid trigger combine pharmacologic non-pharmacologic treatment ( relaxation stress management technique physical therapy ) , effective treatment modality still lack . Particularly , symptomatic drug effective episode TTH , whereas preventive treatment ( indicated frequent chronic TTH ) , average , barely effective , display good tolerability . Patients turn complementary alternative therapy headache , include osteopathic manipulative therapy ( OMTh ) . One previous pilot study carry investigator suggest efficacy OMTh frequent episodic TTH , might represent alternative treatment strategy prophylactic drug . Frequent episodic TTH ( ETTH ) chosen study since common diagnostic category indication prophylactic drug management . To date rigorously test evidence manual therapy general positive effect TTH , many reviewer find . Conflicting result previous study might due low number clinical trial indiscriminate application different technique . Some study , however , demonstrate positive effect manipulative therapy . A systematic review find spinal manipulative therapy effective commonly use first-line prophylactic medication TTH migraine headache , Authors emphasize conclusion base trial , raise question whether analysis methodologically adequate . A recent systematic review conclude spinal manipulation might alleviate TTH small quantity available data prevent definitive conclusion . The combination physical therapy medication , also increase success treatment , particularly case comorbid mood disorder unremitting headache , previously suggest . Although result others published study suggest positive effect , OMTh rarely rigorously test care patient headache general . OMTh free cost plausibly characterize few contraindication adverse event conventional pharmacological treatment , particularly indicated patient compliant drug regimen increase risk adverse drug effect . Notably , disparity patient perception clinical definition adverse event , conceptual model four inter-related component ( expectation , personal investment , osteopathic encounter clinical change ) suggest . Patients might report mild effect follow OMTh general form manual therapy , effect strictly regard adverse event . Our previous pilot trial observe adverse event among ETTH patient belong arm study ( treatment sham ) . Exceedingly rare serious adverse event may observe spine manipulation , one many different technique usually administer osteopathic clinical field recommendation already publish meet requirement principles prevention precaution . For example , minor unwanted effect prior manipulation search routinely take contraindication future spinal manipulation . Great care take particular anatomic condition cord encroachment increase vertebra-basilar risk present . Certainly , besides effectiveness , still completely proven , financial impact OMTh subject health system could also topic appraisal future comparative study . However , consider exposed priority field , investigator decide firstly address RCT question OMTh efficacy versus OMTh-sham treatment ETTH . Aims : This protocol randomize control trial ( RCT ) explore efficacy OMTh ETTH respect OMTh-sham treatment single blind multicenter design . If OMTh effectiveness could demonstrate patient , two putative repercussion ETTH management might expect : ( ) increase compliance ; ( b ) low rate side effect . Furthermore , OMTh would increase range available strategy manage ETTH clinical practice , perhaps even add-on therapy . Study Design : This multi-centre , double-blinded , randomize , sham-treatment ( SHAM ) -controlled study use experimental design . Presumed ETTH patient screen pre-selected primary care setting ( general practitioner ) , diagnosis TTH review ( time -30 , T-30 ) neurologist ask patient complete headache diary 30 day randomization . Diaries review time 0 ( T0 ; baseline ) blind-rater D.O . decide number attack compatible diagnosis ETTH , allow randomization . The blind-rater perform osteopathic structural examination compulsory include ( semi-structured evaluation ) also assessment temporo-mandibular joint disorder cervical dysfunction ( TMJD CD ) order define putative goal OMT use score Goal Attainment Scale ( GAS , see Outcomes ) without involve treat D.O . operate independently . Furthermore , patient ask complete Headache Disability Inventory ( HDI ) Headache Impact Test-6 ( HIT-6 ) . Randomization perform coordinate centre ( Univ . Milano-Bicocca , Italy ) randomly pre-generated list ; coordinate centre , without inform blind-rater , communicate local Osteopathic Clinic detail . Patients give instruction start treatment ( OMT vs. SHAM blind ) administer treat D.O . unblinded treatment allocation . Patients receive 4 weekly treatment complete headache diary along whole study ( T120 ) . The blind-rater review diary relative previous period ask patient complete HDI/HIT-6 30 day ( T30 , end treatment ) , 60 day ( T60 , follow-up-1 ) , 90 day ( T90 , follow-up-2 ) 120 day ( T120 , end study ) respect randomization ( T0 ) . An osteopathic structural examination perform T120 ( end study ) GAS scoring . A central database fill . Inclusion criterion : ( 1 ) diagnosis ETTH accord current International Headache Society guideline ; ( 2 ) willing comply RCT procedure . Exclusion criterion : ( 1 ) patient 18 65 year age ; ( 2 ) use previous three month drug acute headache ten day per month ; ( 3 ) duration disease less one year ; ( 4 ) history major psychiatric disease , significant cognitive disorder , significant chronic pain headache , general secondary headache ; ( 5 ) kind ongoing prophylactic treatment take place whole study period ; ( 6 ) estroprogestinic therapy start modified whole study period . Patients blindly allocate ( A ) experimental arm ( OMT ) ( B ) control arm ( SHAM ) , i.e. , manual perceptive technique without correction observe osteopathic disorder . In order minimize perceive difference , group undergo osteopathic structural examination , similar amount time spend session . OMT protocol-based treating D.O . compulsory include evaluation ( possible treatment ) TMJD CD ( semi-structured treatment ) . Specifically , OMT focus correct osteopathic dysfunction find initial evaluation ; structural ( include myofascial release HVLA ) , visceral craniosacral technique administer appropriate . As regard sham treatment , operator restrict assessment cranial rhythmic impulse ( CRI ) patient , spend similar amount time spend OMT-treated patient . Primary outcome change T120 patient-reported headache frequency least 30 % respect control group ( base previous pilot study , Rolle et al . 2014 ) . Secondary outcome include : ( ) significant reduction time respect control group average headache intensity base scale 0 ( absence pain ) 5 ( bad perceive pain ) ( consider sensible respect 0-to-3 scale , see Rolle et al . 2014 ) ; ( b ) significant reduction time respect control group over-the-counter medication usage ; ( c ) significant reduction time respect control group HDI/HIT-6 score ; ( ) significant reduction time respect control group patient-reported headache frequency . Tertiary outcome : significant reduction time respect control group blind-rater evaluation osteopathic effect whole treatment respect attainment initially propose . This score assess purely term correction osteopathic dysfunction detect T0 , use GAS , five-point score ranging : -2 ( much less expected outcome ) , -1 ( less expect outcome ) , 0 ( expect outcome reach ) , +1 ( great expect outcome ) , +2 ( much great expect outcome ) . Finally , side effect record visit . Patients instruct immediately report serious adverse effect .</detailed_description>
