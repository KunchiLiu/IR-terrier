	<brief_title>Clarithromycin Multiple Myeloma Induction Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The survival young myeloma patient improved ninety introduction high-dose melphalan autologous stem cell support ( HDT ) . However , patient eventually experience relapse HDT need improvement response HDT . The choice induction treatment HDT affect outcome induction therapy well outcome HDT . Clarithromycin macrolide antibiotic frequently utilized treatment respiratory tract infection often use patient know hypersensitivity beta-lactam antibiotic . Besides antibiotic activity , clarithromycin may exert immunomodulatory anti-inflammatory effect . The toxicity profile clarithromycin favourable cost low . Studies cell line show clarithromycin attenuates autophagy myeloma cell recent study demonstrate treatment clarithromycin enhance bortezomib-induced cytotoxicity myeloma cell . Phase II study without control group indicate clarithromycin might enhance effect thalidomide lenalidomide . A case-matched analysis compare patient one centre receive clarithromycin , lenalidomide dexamethasone equal number patient another centre receive lenalidomide dexamethasone . This study indicate favourable effect clarithromycin high frequency complete response , very-good-partial-response good response progression-free survival . However , need control study determine whether clarithromycin might enhance effect myeloma agent . This randomize placebo-controlled study include 160 patient newly diagnose multiple myeloma eligible HDT . The study evaluate potential synergic anti-myeloma activity clarithromycin combine VCD induction therapy patient newly diagnose multiple myeloma , conduct Danish Myeloma Study Group ( DMSG ) seven clinic Denmark . The first patient include May 2015 enrolment expect continue October 2016 . The study end last included patient follow two month HDT .</detailed_description>
