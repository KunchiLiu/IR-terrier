	<detailed_description>Objectives : The primary objective DRIVE-IN project evaluate feasibility implement interventional cohort PWID Haiphong . Such cohort ( DRIVE ) instrumental demonstrate efficacy community-involved intervention integrate prevention care order reduce HIV HCV transmission among PWID Haiphong . The main expected result DRIVE-IN demonstrate enrolment follow-up various hard-to-reach subgroup PWID feasible local context . These feasibility objective evaluate use set relevant indicator . Design : The research first include respondent-driven sampling ( RDS ) survey , include maximum 600 PWID . Then 250 RDS participant ( i.e quarter future DRIVE cohort ) select longitudinal study , enrolment 3 follow-up visit week 4 , 12 24 . In parallel , four qualitative study implement : one study explore reach hardest-to-reach most-at-risk PWID , one feed-back study PWID feel participation research , one study investigate reason drop-outs , final study research process . Endpoints : The RDS describe target population pattern drug use . The feasibility implement interventional cohort evaluate several indicator : - International multi-disciplinary research network operational - Completion recruitment within time frame - Follow-up rate &gt; 80 % 24 week - Implementation increase access peer-led intervention - Establishment data management center - Improved laboratory capacity research - Documented support local national authority Study population RDS survey Inclusion criterion Age &gt; 18 year Self-reported drug injector confirm positive urinary test either skin mark injection knowledge injecting procedure Signed informed consent Non-inclusion criterion Unable understanding inform consent answer questionnaire Longitudinal study Inclusion criterion Having participate RDS survey Signed informed consent specific longitudinal study Non-inclusion criterion Ongoing methadone maintenance therapy Ongoing antiretroviral therapy Health status compatible study follow-up Have plan move Haiphong next two year .
