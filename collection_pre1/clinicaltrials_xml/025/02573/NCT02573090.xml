	<brief_summary>The research project `` SEAL-DK '' focus advantage disadvantage two treatment strategy : non-invasive fissure seal invasive restorative treatment manifest occlusal caries lesion permanent teeth child adolescent . The purpose project promote understanding possibility non-invasive treatment occlusal caries lesion permanent dentition , increase present knowledge optimal threshold seal restoration , respectively , treat lesion . The project carry randomize study two treatment strategy : non-invasive versus invasive treatment occlusal caries . When organize study , emphasize treatment shall carry , conflict participate dentist ' perception clinically proper caries treatment , result shall high reliability consistency . The hypothesis caries progression stop non-invasive fissure seal change threshold postponing time invasive restoration .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : The first restoration fatal prognosis tooth . Studies show caries progression stop tight sealing may even lead re-mineralization lesion . Aim : To investigate possibility treat manifest occlusal caries non-invasive seal instead conventional resin restoration . Study design : study carry prospective , randomized clinical study ( RCT ) . Primary , occlusal caries lesion 521 patient , age 6-17 year old treat non-invasive resin base sealing ( n= 368 ) resin base restoration ( n=153 ) . The dentist patient free choose treatment type . Randomization seal restoration ( 2:1 ) make computer practitioner University Copenhagen keep clinic seal envelope . The treatment examine clinically radiographically 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 7 10 year . The treatment perform control 68 general practitioner Public Dental Health Care Service 9 Danish municipality . Sealing : The dentist use material choice , follow usual clinical procedure base instruction manufacturer guideline The Department Cariology Endodontics , University Copenhagen . Restoration : The dentist use preparation design material choice , follow usual clinical procedure base instruction manufacturer guideline The Department Cariology Endodontics , University Copenhagen . The prevalence regression , arrest progression seal restored caries lesion , compute related clinical radiological registration patient , dentist treatment related factor assess statistically significant correlation . The influence factor quality , longevity need retreatment occlusal sealant restoration , assess use non-parametric test Kaplan-Meier survival analyse statistical treatment data , supplement summarize multivariate survival analyse Cox regression model discriminatory analysis .</detailed_description>
