	<brief_summary>In trial , objectives determine efficacy toxicity induction chemotherapy ( IC ) nab-paclitaxel + cisplatin ( Arm 1 : AP ) nab-paclitaxel ( Arm 2 : A ) alone patient HNSCC , compare data nab-paclitaxel , cisplatin , 5-FU ( APF ) . The investigator also hypothesize high anti-tumor efficacy nab-paclitaxel HNSCC due upregulation macropinocytosis , result frequent presence Ras PI3K ( epidermal growth factor receptor -EGFR ) activation cancer .</brief_summary>
