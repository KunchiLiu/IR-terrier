	<brief_summary>The objective multi-center , non-randomized , prospective pilot study examine rate successful primary spontaneous pneumothorax ( PSP ) resolution use simple aspiration technique . In study , eligible subject diagnose PSP eleven participate large child 's hospital ( member Midwest Pediatric Surgical Clinical Research Consortium ) enrol offer choice management either simple aspiration protocol management accord surgeon 's preference , may include simple aspiration , chest tube placement , rarely , operation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective , non-randomized , multi-center pilot study involve child ( age 12-17 year old ) present first episode primary spontaneous pneumothorax ( PSP ) require treatment . Treatment simple aspiration research adult investigated child . For reason , pilot study design two non-randomized group . Since pediatric surgeon start offer treatment child adult study include adolescent patient , simple aspiration consider standard care treatment many institution , perform part standard care UW . Patient Provider communication regard treatment option Patient Provider choice choice treatment play large role standard care PSP research study . Potential subject identify consult surgeon ( study team member pediatric surgeon application ) surgical consultation request acute management child spontaneous pneumothorax . This commonly occur emergency department chest X-ray obtain part usual evaluation associate symptom pain shortness breath . Medical record may review confirm eligibility prior approach potential subject parents/guardians assent/consent . The consult surgeon also assess patient eligibility screen inclusion exclusion criterion . If eligibility criterion meet , consult surgeon notify member study staff potential subject . A member research team explain study rationale procedure detail potential subject legal guardian upon surgical consultation . All write information review question answer . A study physician available time consent-related question . The potential subject legal guardian one hour consider would like participate study . The child 's legal guardian sign inform consent , subject sign assent . Once consent/assent obtain subject parents/guardians choice consent initial management either simple aspiration protocol ( aspiration group ) accord preference treat surgeon ( preference group ) . All patient properly inform option arm consent discussion , information convey clinical treatment discussion patient incorporated consent discussion . Patient preference choice treatment play large role standard care method treat PSP subject preference choice play strong role research study . As pilot study , aim enroll 32 subject aspiration arm across participate institution 48 subject enroll preference arm . Since medical treatment perform study consider standard care , research component study include subject 's self-allocation particular study arm ( even though patient choice strong role standard care , define arm research study ) record medical billing data subject , well follow-up phone call subject . Aspiration Arm : Subjects arm undergo initial management pneumothorax simple aspiration procedure accord standard care describe . The procedure involve placement small catheter chest cavity apply negative pressure manually aspirate air chest cavity , allow lung re-expand . The aspiration catheter less equal 12 French diameter . Further detail type device size catheter determine surgeon depend device available standard practice participate institution . The procedure may perform local anesthetic , without sedation , depend surgeon judgment available resource standard practice participate institution . The procedure may perform without image guidance ( i.e . ultrasound fluoroscopy ) aspiration , chest X-ray must obtain conclusion procedure , catheter still place , verify successful expansion lung comparison subsequent chest X-rays . A small residual pneumothorax initial aspiration procedure may still deem success . Successful aspiration time initial aspiration procedure define : expansion lung apex top 4th rib high expansion lateral chest wall 6th rib high . A failure define residual pneumothorax limit apex extends laterally chest wall 6th rib . If first post-procedure chest X-ray demonstrate failure adequate lung expansion , exist catheter may use one additional aspiration attempt , application negative pressure follow another chest X-ray . After aspiration procedure , subject admit hospital minimum observation period 6 hour . The small catheter cap leave place insertion site cover occlusive dressing , catheter could utilize event failure aspiration procedure . After 6 hour , second chest X-ray obtain assess recurrent pneumothorax enlargement small residual pneumothorax . If pneumothorax stable small size 6 hour observation , catheter remove patient discharge home . However , pneumothorax recurs enlarge 6 hour , aspiration procedure fail . The exist catheter could uncapped use indwell chest tube prolong period chest drainage , management accord surgeon 's preference standard practice . At time , aspiration procedure determine failure , either inadequate lung expansion recurrent pneumothorax , patient manage accord judgment standard practice treat surgeon . Preference Arm : Subjects choose surgeon preference arm study enrol prospective data collection . These subject portion care direct study protocol . The decision proceed treatment intervention make jointly surgeon patient legal guardian . Any standard treatment option may utilize , include simple aspiration , chest tube placement , operation , video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery ( VATS ) . If surgeon 's preference standard treatment simple aspiration patient want aspiration procedure , surgeon perform alternative treatment option , chest tube placement VATS . Management strategy preference group may include placement indwell chest tube , without thoracoscopic resection bleb ( VATS ) , may also include simple aspiration procedure recommend treat surgeon . For arm , telephone survey conduct approximately one year enrollment . The primary purpose ascertain whether subject seek additional medical treatment another facility unresolved recurrent pneumothorax time recurrence . Additionally , wish know subject ongoing intermittent episode symptom attribute pneumothorax he/she seek medical treatment .</detailed_description>
