	<brief_summary>Evidence exist support ability genetic variation influence patient drug response side effect . To-date , RCT conduct evaluate outcome schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder patient follow use pharmacogenomic guidance treatment selection . The first objective trial utilize double-blinded , randomized clinical trial design evaluate clinical outcome participant treat benefit GeneSight Psychotropic ( GEN ) test . Another objective determine add benefit Enhanced-GeneSight ( E-GEN ) compare GEN pharmacogenomic guidance treatment selection . Furthermore , trial intend develop evidence-based case value GEN E-GEN Canadian healthcare payer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary objective study 1 ) compare efficacy GEN treatment usual ( TAU ) improve response psychotropic treatment patient suffer schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder ; 2 ) validate utility new CAMH marker demonstrate superior predictive capability great clinical utility E-GEN compare GEN . This study design three-arm multi-centre , double-blind ( participant raters ) , randomize control trial compare clinical economic outcome GEN , E-GEN TAU patient suffer schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder . Participants randomize 1:1:1 ratio three treatment arm . Recruitment 27 month . Follow-up 12 month . Subjects complete short diagnostic interview specific clinical diagnosis , basic metabolic measure ( eg . blood pressure , weight ) , provide buccal swab sample genetic analysis ( unanalyzed buccal swab associate DNA biobanked ) . During first visit , blood urine sample require laboratory panel screen blood biobanking . Subjects monitor one year period clinical measure healthcare resource utilization obtain . Treating clinician GEN E-GEN arm receive easy implement report provide pharmacogenomic guidance prescribe psychotropic medication patient . The study recruit subject 10 site , stratify 2 cluster . Nine study sit altogether form one two stratified cluster . CAMH constitute tenth study site second stratified cluster . The sample size require study calculate use expect change PANSS , difference treatment group ( GEN E-GEN ) TAU 0.5 standard deviation . Assuming intra class coefficient cluster 20 % , statistical power 90 % , alpha level 0.05 , expect drop-out rate 42 % Week 12 , total 531 subject ( i.e. , 177 per treatment arm ) require detect effect study .</detailed_description>
