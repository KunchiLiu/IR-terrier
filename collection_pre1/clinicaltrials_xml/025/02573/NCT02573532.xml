	<brief_title>Incidence , Patient Characteristics , Pathophysiology , Outcome Perioperative Myocardial Injury After Non-cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Worldwide 230 million surgical operation perform year . Despite advance field medicine , still significant risk death related major non-cardiac surgical procedure . The observed 30-day mortality depend patient- well procedural factor range 1 % 10 % . Cardiovascular complication , particularly perioperative myocardial injury/infarction ( PMI ) seem major contributor third death . PMI may differ spontaneous acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) . The vast majority patient experience PMI NOT acute chest pain symptom typical AMI likely narcotize sedated random ECGs often informative . Accordingly , patient PMI currently detect routine clinical practice . Missed diagnosis invariably associate missed opportunity initiation treatment . As patient PMI miss routine clinical care , true incidence outcome PMI largely unknown . Prior study often obtain baseline sample thus suggest cTn elevation likely due AMI may exaggerate number . In addition , usually conventional less sensitive assay use . Further , predominant pathophysiology PMI currently unknown . It suggest type II MI characterize coronary perfusion pressure mismatch type I MI characterize acute thrombotic coronary occlusion predominate mechanism . However , autopsy data suggest plaque rupture common . Thus , may type 2 AMI common modest incidence type 1 AMI dangerous prognostically . Aim : To explore incidence , patient characteristic , pathophysiology , long-term outcome PMI major non-cardiac surgery Methodology : 2000 consecutive high-risk patient undergo major non-cardiac surgery include follow one year occurrence all-cause death major adverse cardiac event . Patients receive standardize assessment cardiovascular status systematic perioperative screen PMI use high sensitivity cardiac troponin T ( hs-cTnT ) baseline prior surgery , well day 1 day 2 surgery Acute cardiac injury define absolute increase ( +Δ ) hs-cardiac troponin ( cTnT ) ≥14ng/L compare baseline . A search possible alternative cause hs-cTnT elevation aggressively seek rise pattern value detect . Two independent expert adjudicate likely cause PMI use clinical information pertain individual patient include 12-lead ECG , peak hs-cTnT blood concentration , coronary angiography myocardial perfusion scan . Influence PMI occurrence all-cause death assess use multivariate Cox- proportional hazard analysis . Further , pre-operative post-operative prediction model death , major adverse cardiac event , PMI shall derive use derivation-validation design . Potential Significance : This study generate scientific data major scientific implication contribute close current knowledge gap concern influence PMI long-term mortality well incidence , patient characteristic , pathophysiology PMI non-cardiac surgery . This knowledge immediate clinical implication could e.g . lead major change perioperative management reconsideration necessary target blood pressure avoid coronary perfusion mismatch consecutive cardiac injury .</detailed_description>
