	<brief_summary>Over last decade , change diet lifestyle lead overall energy imbalance become commonplace emergence obesity epidemic 1.6 billion adult overweight . Consumption food affect appetite increase satiety could regulate total energy intake thus body weight . There data suggest macronutrient composition food especially protein content may potent role satiety . However , type protein appear play role satiety possibly due different balance amino acid profile . The research project dedicate identify source ( animal plant ) optimize protein quantity need accelerate satiation , suppress appetite extend satiety hunger appear . It hypothesize consumption animal derive protein-enriched meal induce reduction hunger impact gut hormone peptide closely related short-term regulation food intake .</brief_summary>
