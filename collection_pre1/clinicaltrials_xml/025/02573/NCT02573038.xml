	<brief_summary>Angioid streak rare lesion associate retinal pigment epithelium degeneration . They cause general disease pseudoxanthoma elasticum , Paget 's disease drepanocytosis . Choroidal neovascularization ( CNV ) represent frequent complication patient . It lead rapid important loss visual acuity . CNV angioid streak represent fourth lead cause CNV young patient . CNV angioid streak treat moment off-label anti-VEGF ( Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor ) therapy could also benefit aflibercept ( EYLEA ) , new anti-VEGF currently indicate AMD . Case report suggest patient would need many injection AMD . ASTRID open-label , single arm , prospective , multicenter , phase II study . The main objective demonstrate effectiveness clinical term 52 week treatment aflibercept visual acuity patient affect CNV angioid streak . A specific dosage regimen design achieve maximum efficiency . The patient follow monthly basis 52 week . Six injection mandatory , one inject case active CNV .</brief_summary>
