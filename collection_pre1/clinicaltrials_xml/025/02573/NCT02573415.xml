	<brief_title>Uterine Transplantation Treatment Uterine Factor Infertility</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Uterine factor infertility ( UFI ) one irreversible cause female infertility . Until recently , medical surgical option available woman diagnosis . UFI define lack functional uterus ; condition either congenital ( e.g . Rokitansky syndrome , woman bear without intact uterus ) acquire ( e.g . result hysterectomy damage uterus procedure infection ) . Uterine infertility affect 3-5 % female population . It estimate least 50,000 woman reproductive age uterine infertility United States . Existing option woman affect UFI limited adoption maternal surrogacy . Surrogacy involve harvest egg UFI patient fertilize egg lab intention implant fertilize embryos third party carry pregnancy . Adoption surrogacy consider acceptable option many woman UFI . For others , due social , ethical , cultural and/or religious reason , option permissible . In many country around world , maternal surrogacy illegal , leave option UFI patient conceive biological child . Recently , uterine transplantation propose alternative method treat UFI . Uterine transplantation intend life enhancing procedure , life save procedure , consider similar transplant face , extremities pancreas . Interestingly , uterine transplantation consider `` ephemeral '' transplant , intend last duration life recipient . The transplant maintain long necessary produce one two offspring patient . The need novel approach UFI clear excite work team investigator Sweden finally demonstrate year uterine transplantation result successful delivery healthy infant minimal risk mother . After careful collaboration Swedish group , aim bring first uterine transplantation protocol United States use multidisciplinary team investigator within Cleveland Clinic . There 11 uterine transplant perform human worldwide . The first uterine transplant perform Saudi Arabia 2000 . The living-donor graft survive 3 month subsequently remove due graft failure . The failure graft attribute thrombosis ( blood clot affect circulation organ ) . Pregnancy never attempt use transplant uterus prior remove . This year , Brännström M. et al . publish experience first clinical trial human uterine transplantation series 9 woman . The clinical trial , base Sweden , begin 2012 Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) approval University Gothenburg . The nine woman study group receive uteri living donor report , publish Fertility Sterility May 2014 , describe seven nine transplant viable six month follow . Nonviability two graft reportedly due uterine artery thrombosis . In case , donor recipient 's mother . Eight recipient Rokitansky syndrome . One recipient undergone hysterectomy cervical cancer . There immediate perioperative complication patient successful graft begin spontaneous menstrual period within month transplantation . Mild rejection appear treatable steroid . All recipient 10 viable embryo produce vitro fertilization perform prior uterine transplantation . Those embryos transfer transplanted uterus achieve pregnancy . This research result first publish report human live birth uterine transplantation . In Gothenburg experience , donor operation consist hysterectomy include uterine artery vein branch internal iliac artery vein vault vagina . The first segment ovarian vein caudad ovary ( order protect outflow ) also include . The explanted uterus perfuse chilled University Wisconsin ( UW ) solution prepared implantation . The implantation achieve anastomosis iliac vessel bilaterally , case donor ovarian vein include . The vault donor vagina anastomose exist vagina neovagina . Immunosuppression follow uterine transplantation include induction thymoglobulin maintenance tacrolimus , mycophenolate mofetil oral steroid . Mycophenolate mofetil discontinue pregnancy attempt contraindicate pregnancy . This immunosuppression regimen similar regimen proven effective kidney transplantation , another solid organ graft . Dr. Andreas Tzakis work closely Gothenburg group early animal model well recent clinical trial human . Below summary group 's publish relevant finding : 1 . Two graft lose ( one soon transplant 4 month later ) due uterine artery thrombosis . 2 . One donor surgical complication , ureter injured removal uterus , require late ureteral reimplantation due ischemic damage ureter 3 . Five recipient develop mild rejection graft . This detected cervical biopsy treat successfully steroids case . 4 . Menstruation occur regularly seven subject successful transplant within month transplantation . 5 . One document subject one live birth Cesarean section ; pregnancy complicate preeclampsia ( high blood pressure pregnancy ) 31.5 week gestation 4 . Pregnancy Solid Organ Transplantation Since one live birth human uterine transplant recipient report , pregnancy risk firmly establish ; however pregnancies delivery uterine transplantation healthy offspring accomplish small large animal ( mouse , rat , sheep , nonhuman primate ) . In addition , pregnancy solid organ transplant human well document . The use immunosuppressive medication well studied pregnancy solid organ transplantation well woman certain rheumatologic condition inflammatory bowel disease . Tacrolimus cyclosporine among widely use pregnancy . Birth defect cyclosporine tacrolimus occur incidence 4-5 % different general population . Cyclosporine associate low birth weight appear impact long term outcome include intelligence quotient ( IQ ) . Mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) associate specific pattern birth defect include facial malformation , finger abnormality heart defect . This medication use first trim pregnancy . Azathioprine cause birth defect . Corticosteroids consider safe however high dos increase risk premature rupture membrane . Immunosuppression also notice infant expose medication pregnancy include low immunoglobulin level lymphocyte count . Most deficit seem normalize sixth month life , note impact infant ' health . Renal transplant common solid organ transplant pregnancy report . In woman 90 % achieve successful pregnancy outcome first trimester . Pregnancy risk include low birth weight , preterm delivery preeclampsia . It consistently show pregnancy adversely affect graft function survival . The frequent maternal complication patient population pregnancy induce hypertension . Management pregnancy complication uterine transplant recipient follow standard obstetric guideline . Prematurity main fetal complication , affect nearly 40 % live birth . The mean report gestational age delivery 36.5 week , mean birth weight approximately 14 % less general population ( 6 lb 5 oz v 7 lb 4 oz ) . Other fetal complication observe include intrauterine growth restriction ( approximately 20 % ) , prenatal infection , birth defect . Over 400 pregnancy liver transplantation report . Similar risk report woman include preeclampsia preterm birth low birth weight . Less data available woman undergone less common transplant . Kidney-pancreas transplant associate high complication rate . Hypertension report 75 % addition 55 % risk infection 68 % risk low birth weight . These study limit lack consideration original disease organ recipient functional status transplant organ . Women undergo uterine transplantation significant preexist medical condition unlike woman undergo solid organ transplantation . Both element likely influence incidence complication pregnancy include previous large analysis . According The American Society Transplantation , pregnancy allowable renal organ transplantation one year transplantation sign rejection , transplant organ adequate function , active infection ( particularly cytomegalovirus infection ) immunosuppression dose stable . Waiting one year transplantation prior conception decrease risk acute rejection infection . During pregnancy important monitor blood pressure treat hypertension diligently , maintain strict glycemic control , monitor sign infection , assess maternal level immunosuppressive medication frequently .</detailed_description>
