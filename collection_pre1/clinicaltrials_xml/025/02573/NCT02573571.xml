	<detailed_description>Medical world nowadays witness sudden increase incidence infection Clostridium difficile ( DCI ) . This due part prolongation survival patient major comorbidities like solid tumor malignancy lymphomas also widespread intake proton pump inhibitor wide-spectrum antimicrobial . It highly probable isolates C.define cause pandemic genetically different isolates specie predominate 20 year ago . This hypothesis develop base data epidemiology CDI : old time administration clindamycin ampicillin main driver CDI ; recent study report fluoroquinolones , 2nd 3rd generation cephalosporin even vancomycin ( i.e . drug choice CDI ) link development CDI . One major hurdle management CDI relapse ; risk relapse report 15-20 % first episode ; however geometrically increase even 60-80 % second episode . As consequence , management CDI become major health problem . Fidaxomicin novel compound active specie C.dificille . Results two recent double-blind , randomize , large scale clinical study show oral treatment 10 day fidaxomicin 200mg bid non-inferior oral treatment vancomycin 125mg q6h . However , risk relapse treatment vancomycin close 25 % fidaxomicin close 15 % . This difference statistically significant trial outscore superiority fidaxomicin vancomycin management CDI . Moreover , meta-analysis show significant reduction mortality fidaxomicin . Despite proven superiority , prescription fidaxomicin limited case mostly due high cost . In many country prescription restrict case relapse CDI . Clinical feel come post-marketing experience well publish evidence support use fidaxomicin case risk death overt risk relapse . However , molecular analysis C.difficile pathogen use tool prediction relapse since relapse case pathogens carry less 2 single nucleotide variant initial isolate . SPECIFY aim develop score use clinical genetic biomarker data efficiently discriminate patient risk severe CDI risk relapse CDI . This score become future tool discriminate patient need treatment fidaxomicin instead traditional treatment metronidazole/vancomycin .</detailed_description>
