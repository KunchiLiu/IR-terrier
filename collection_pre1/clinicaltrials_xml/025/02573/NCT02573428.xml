	<brief_summary>The primary purpose present study evaluate diagnostic validity eye track measurement acquire view socially-relevant stimulus predict ASD diagnosis . The secondary purpose explore potential prognostic value eye track measure cross-sectional association non-verbal cognitive ability . Deficits eye gaze hallmark sign autism . A large grow body research support ability eye-tracking base measurement sensitively discriminate individual ASD healthy participant . These investigation identify core deficit autism disruption social attention , reflect inability appropriately engage track socially- emotionally-relevant aspect visual world . Thus , eye gaze tracking , acquire view socially-relevant stimulus , may useful approach identify objective marker ASD . Eye track also carry advantage less intrusive expensive MRI genetic test specifically focus core neurobehavioral characteristic ASD - abnormality social attention . After diagnosis ASD , key clinical task young child involve determine accurate prognosis track progress early intervention . Currently , prognostic indicator clinical observation ( subjective expensive ) non-verbal cognitive ability test ( difficult acquire , time-consuming , unavailable many setting ) . Recently , eye gaze track find predict functional outcome . Thus , addition objective marker ASD , eye track measurement potential useful predict cognitive functional outcome . Similarly , available method track treatment progress parental report ( highly subjective ) , clinical observation ( subjective expensive ) , cognitive measurement ( expensive unavailable many setting . This study evaluate , use cross-section data , potential eye track data serve proxy non-verbal cognitive ability score determine prognosis ASD-affected child . Additionally , study evaluate test re-test reliability eye track parameter potentially use track treatment progress .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating Validity Eye Gaze Paradigm Predicting Autism Spectrum Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current study occur four phase : pilot test , development , validation , re-test . In phase , participant view visual attention stimulus social element ( social attention paradigm ) eye track measurement remotely acquire . The visual attention paradigm refine pilot test remain development , validation , re-test phase . The entire process , include calibration view visual paradigm , take 15 minute . The text describe phase detail review specific methodology social attention paradigm eye track procedure . 1 . Pilot Phase . Pilot test social attention paradigm use elicit eye gaze measurement ensure sufficiently engage across age child participate . The visual attention paradigm phase expect 10-12 minute . This phase also use determine optimal strategy maintain attention throughout test period . Initial data may also provide insight discriminate stimulus element include future phase . Investigators anticipate recruit approximately 10 ASD 10 non-ASD participant phase . The pilot phase expect require 2.5 month recruitment 0.5 month data reduction analysis . 2 . Development Phase . Once pilot test complete , 30 ASD-affected 30 non-ASD child age 1.5 18 recruit . Each child complete social attention paradigm eye gaze remotely track . Eye gaze data score 100 parameter score enter database include diagnostic cognitive information participant . The eye track data analyze create diagnostic prognostic algorithm refine system 's diagnostic sensitivity specificity ASD population . The development period require 6 month data collection , follow 3 month score algorithm computation . 3 . Validation Phase . Collection validation sample include 60 ASD-affected 60 non-ASD affected child age 1.5-18 . The validation phase use visual social attention paradigm method use development sample . The validation period overlap algorithm development require 8 month data collection 1 month analysis . 4 . Re-Test Phase . Participants re-test phase include 30 ASD 30 non-ASD child recruit first half validation phase . These participant explain validation phase investigator re-recruiting re-test phase approximately 3-6 month follow initial test validation phase . The target sample size varies depend phase study . Below target sample sizes phase : Pilot Phase = 10 ASD 10 Non-ASD Development Phase = 30 ASD 30 Non-ASD Validation Phase = 60 ASD 60 Non-ASD Re-Test Phase = 30 ASD 30 Non-ASD ( validation phase ) The study population individual autism spectrum disorder , clinical diagnosis another developmental psychiatric disorder ( developmental/psychiatric control ) , specific developmental psychiatric diagnosis ( healthy control ) , age 1.5 ( 18 month ) 18 ( 120 month ) time consent . Eye gaze data collect use remote eye tracker Sensori-motoric instrument ( SMI ) . Remote eye track offer minimal invasiveness viewer 's field view collect time-stamped , 3D eye position , binocular gaze pupil data sample rate 120 Hz . Eye gaze capture automatically calibrate 2/5/9 point provide position accuracy 0.5Â° 60cm view distance . Gaze track data , screen recording , user event , gaze position record simultaneously . Data analyze emphasis areas-of- interest dwell time specific target second-by-second basis . Examples type measure capture include : dwell time area stimulus , dwell time face non-face region human form video , fixation shift stimuli . Additional test demographic data collect standard care autism diagnostic behavioral health diagnostic appointment find medical record . Pilot Analyses . In pilot phase , investigator compute effect size ( Cohen 's ) ASD non-ASD participant eye gaze parameter acquire individual stimulus social attention paradigm . Stimulus element elicit large discrimination ASD non-ASD patient retain development phase . ASD Diagnostic Algorithm Analyses . In development phase , eye gaze measurement acquire social attention paradigm include predictor variable random forest analysis . This analysis permit evaluation discriminative ability large number variable data set modest number case . The variable high importance score , indicate good diagnostic discrimination , enter logistic regression analysis ASD diagnostic status ( ASD vs. non-ASD ) dichotomous dependent variable . Significant predictor retain coefficient retain predictor serve diagnostic algorithm . The diagnostic algorithm score submit Receiver Operating Characteristic ( ROC ) curve analysis provide detailed evaluation sensitivity specificity algorithm detection ASD . Areas curve &gt; .90 expect , indicate strong diagnostic validity . Prognostic Algorithm Analyses . To identify prognostic algorithm , similar process conduct available eye track measurement predictor non-verbal cognitive ability score ( dichotomize &lt; 70 70 ) dependent variable random forest analysis . Non-verbal cognitive ability score dichotomize base previous data suggest individual ASD intellectual disability show worse outcome . The predictor variables high importance , indicate good diagnostic discrimination , enter logistic regression analysis non-verbal cognitive ability ( &lt; 70 , &gt; =70 ) dichotomous dependent variable . Significant predictor retain coefficient retain predictor serve prognostic algorithm . The prognostic algorithm score submit Receiver Operating Characteristic ( ROC ) curve analysis provide detailed evaluation sensitivity specificity algorithm detection non-verbal cognitive disability . Areas curve &gt; .80 expect , indicate good validity predict cognitive disability . Non-verbal cognitive ability primary focus analysis document relationship outcome individual autism . However , similar analysis compute verbal cognitive ability adaptive function score . Investigators also conduct analysis use continuous measurement dichotomization may unnecessarily deflate validity . Treatment Tracking Algorithm Analyses . To identify treatment track algorithm , investigator simply combine eye track measurement identify diagnostic prognostic algorithm single treatment track algorithm . To evaluate test re-test reliability measurement investigator use intra-class correlation coefficient ( model 2 - absolute agreement ) .</detailed_description>
