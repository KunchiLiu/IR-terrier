	<brief_summary>Batefenterol inhalation powder currently development fixed-dose combination fluticasone furoate ( FF ) treatment Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) . The present study administer batefenterol/FF ( 300/100 microgram [ mcg ] ) first time subject COPD , investigate safety tolerability combination compare placebo , evaluate pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics profile individual component administer combination . This Phase IIa , multicenter , randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blind , parallel group study . Subjects randomize ( 2:1 ) one follow double-blind treatment group : Batefenterol/FF 300/100 mcg inhalation powder daily , match placebo inhalation powder daily . Subjects self-administer study treatment daily ( QD ) morning 42 day via multi-dose dry powder inhaler ( DPI ) contain two blister strip . Additionally , inhale short act beta2-receptor agonist , albuterol provide screening end treatment period subject use need relieve COPD symptom . At end treatment period , subject resume conventional therapy . The study randomize approximately 60 subject . The total duration subject participation ( screen follow-up ) approximately 8 week .</brief_summary>

Age gender : Male female subject , 40 year age old time signing informed consent , eligible participate study . Female subject : eligible participate pregnant ( confirm negative urine human chorionic gonadotrophin ( hCG ) test ) , lactate , least one follow condition applies : 1 . Nonreproductive potential define : Premenopausal females one following : document tubal ligation ; document hysteroscopic tubal occlusion procedure followup confirmation bilateral tubal occlusion ; hysterectomy ; document bilateral oophorectomy Postmenopausal define 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea . Females hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) whose menopausal status doubt require use one highly effective contraception method wish continue HRT study . Otherwise , must discontinue HRT allow confirmation postmenopausal status prior study enrolment . 2 . Reproductive potential agrees follow one option list 30 day prior first dose study medication least five terminal halflives OR continue pharmacologic effect end , whichever longer last dose study medication completion followup visit .

The investigator responsible ensure subject understand properly use method contraception . Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) : An established clinical history COPD accordance definition American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society . COPD Disease severity : A postalbuterol forced expiratory volume 1 second ( FEV1 ) /forced vital capacity ( FVC ) ratio = &lt; 0.70 postalbuterol FEV1 &gt; =30 = &lt; 80 % predict normal value calculate use European Respiratory Society Global Lung Function Initiative reference equation Visit 1 . Smoking history : Current former cigarette smoker history cigarette smoke &gt; = 10 packyears Visit 1 . Former smoker define stop smoke least 6 month prior Visit 1 . Number pack year = ( number cigarette per day / 20 ) x number year smoke ( example , 20 cigarette per day 10 year , 10 cigarette per day 20 year equal 10 packyears ) . Note : Pipe cigar use use calculate packyear history . Asthma : A current diagnosis asthma ( Subjects prior history asthma eligible current diagnosis COPD ) . Other Respiratory Disorders : Known alpha1 antitrypsin deficiency , active lung infection ( tuberculosis ) , lung cancer absolute exclusionary condition . Other excluded condition include limit clinically significant bronchiectasis , pulmonary hypertension unrelated COPD , sarcoidosis , interstitial lung disease .
