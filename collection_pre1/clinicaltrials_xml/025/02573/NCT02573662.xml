	<brief_summary>Introduction This study evaluate effect glucose , lipid bone metabolism follow knee orthopedic procedure healthy physically active individual . The sedentary rehabilitation period follow procedure may impact negatively glucose , lipid bone metabolic pathway , whereas physically active rehabilitation period institute 6 week surgery hypothesize impact positively . Perspective This study establish whether well-known effect glucose , lipid bone metabolism sedentary lifestyle observe already follow 6 week physical inactivity otherwise healthy physically fit young middle age individual . Investigators thereby add knowledge previous finding follow strict bed-rest healthy individual glucose , lipid bone metabolism . In clinical perspective important examine extent healthy individual deteriorate various metabolic pathway well understand pathophysiology behind defect healthy individual patient , undergo bed rest equal reduction physical activity part rehabilitation . Study design 16 physical active non-diabetic individual age 18 - 50 year undergoing knee surgical procedure Arthroscopic Center Amager/Hvidovre Hospitals recruit case case-control study . 10 non-diabetic control subject match age , gender physical activity recruit establish reference level . - The individual bring morning spot urine measurement soluble urokinase plasminogen activate receptor ( suPAR ) , creatinine , albumin orosomucoid . Weight height waist hip circumference measure . - Oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) ingestion 75 g glucose 5 min baseline ( 0 min ) . Plasma glucose , insulin , C-peptide , non-esterified fatty acid ( NEFA ) draw - Before OGTT blood drawn measurement HbA1c , total cholesterol , LDL , HDL , triglyceride , Na , K , creatinine , hemoglobin ( HgB ) , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , leukocytes , alanintransaminase ( ALAT ) , alkaline phosphatase , Ca++ , D vitamin , TSH , bone turnover marker ( BTM ) , suPAR , interleukin 6 ( IL6 ) , TNFa , high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ( hsCRP ) , lipid density profile lipid particle size . - Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) hip , lumbar columna , visceral subcutaneous fat measure Hologic Discovery scanner .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hypothesis Implementation sedentary lifestyle almost physical activity otherwise physical active individual undergo knee orthopaedic surgical procedure 6 week ( 4 8 week ) - derange insulin sensitivity glucose effectiveness - decrease disposition index - imply hyper-secretion incretin hormone glucagon - compensatory decrease insulin clearance - decrease lipid oxidation - increase visceral adipose tissue - increase number low density lipoprotein particles decrease particle size - increase immune low grade inflammatory response measure plasma urine - induce bone loss hip measure bone mineral density ( BMD ) - increase bone resorption decrease bone formation measure select bone turnover marker . The propose negative change bone , lipid glucose metabolism think reverse least partly , active physical rehabilitation week 6 week 16 . Statistics Ten day bed rest 13 healthy young individual show 20 % ( P &lt; 0.05 ) significant decrease insulin sensitivity 50 % ( P &lt; 0.05 ) reduction lipid oxidation . Thirty-one day bed rest 8 healthy woman significantly associate bone loss total hip ( 2.07 % , P &lt; 0.001 ) . As present study imply strict bed rest exhibit longer sedentary period follow study include large number participant likely exhibit power &gt; 80 % significance level Ethical issue The study approve local scientific ethical committee Danish Data Protection Agency . The study adhere Danish Act Processing Personal Data , Danish Act Health Helsinki II convention clinical trial . The study announce clinicaltrials.gov homepage . All participant inform purpose study , ethical issue write consent obtain participation . Personal data patient medical file access principal investigator gather information concern knee injury order identify characterize knee injury subject . Personal data concern demographic relation gender age access well ensure case subject meet inclusion criterion statistically use . To make assessment study participation , principal investigator also gain access relevant data patient medical file concern illness condition case subject might report . The X-ray radiation 1 DXA scan equal 1 day background radiation Denmark . Thus 3 DXA scan throughout study period equal 3 day background radiation . This amount radiation 30-fold less single standard CT-scan abdomen . In word dose radiation low calculation risk possible . The amount blood drawn approximately 16 week participation study le 500 ml , standard amount blood drawn single donation blood blood donor . The use intravenous cannula cause irritation infection vein insertion site . All procedure perform described SOP .</detailed_description>
