	<detailed_description>This NANT trial determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) autologous expand natural killer ( NK ) cell combine standard dose ch14.18 ass feasibility add lenalidomide recommend Phase II dose expand NK cell ch14.18 , treatment child refractory recurrent neuroblastoma . Ch14.18 chimeric antibody GD2 , express majority neuroblastoma cell . It show increase EFS OS patient high-risk neuroblastoma give autologous stem cell transplant combination subcutaneous GM-CSF intravenous IL-2 , follow isotretinoin . Lenalidomide study child solid tumor safely give patient base 2 prior trial child . It also show immunomodulatory effect synergistic ch14.18 . Lenalidomide also oral agent give outpatient setting . Natural killer cell lymphocytes innate immune system ability recognize kill malignant cell , include neuroblastoma . Ch14.18 lenalidomide exert part anti-cancer effect activation natural killer cell . Patients give combination NANT 2011-04 safety immunomodulatory effect establish study dose level propose study . Natural killer cell dysfunctional low number many cancer patient , number function suppress chemotherapy radiation . Investigators hypothesize autologous NK cell expand activated ex vivo readministered restore number function , combination lenalidomide ch14.18 provide anti-tumor effect patient relapse refractory neuroblastoma . Investigators determine feasibility centralize expansion , cryopreservation , distribution autologous NK cell . Investigators determine maximum tolerate dose assess toxicity autologous expand NK cell give ch14.18 ; assess toxicity , cytokinetics immunomodulatory effect , Investigators select recommend Phase II dose two-agent combination dose escalation NK cell add lenalidomide combination establish three-agent combination . Cytokinetics ( persistence infuse NK cell ) immune function study require patient enter study . In addition routine assessment response , quantification rare tumor cell detection blood bone marrow use TLDA also provide another measure possible anti-tumor efficacy support rationale final schedule chosen .</detailed_description>
