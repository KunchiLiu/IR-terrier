Subjects require fast six hour anytime dose OZ439 . - Cohort 3 DSM265 administer single dose ( 400 mg ) describe cohort 1 . No additional dose administer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Characterise Antimalarial Transmission Blocking Activity Single Dose DSM265 OZ439 Healthy Subjects With Induced Blood Stage Plasmodium Falciparum Plasmodium Vivax Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-centre , open label study use induced blood stage malaria ( IBSM ) infection ass effectiveness investigational drug DSM265 OZ439 reduce parasitemia . Transmission block activity DSM265 ( P. falciparum infection ; cohort 1 ) infectivity vector mosquito prior drug treatment ( P. vivax infection ; cohort 2 3 ) also assess . This study conduct three cohort ( n = 8 per cohort ) , divide 2 part . In Part A ( cohort 1 ) efficacy single administration 400 mg DSM265 clearance asexual blood stage P. falciparum determine . Activity second single dose 400 mg DSM265 gametocyte assess cohort sexual stage identify PCR follow initial drug treatment . In Part B , subject infected P. vivax IBSM , treat single 200 mg dose OZ439 ( cohort 2 ) 400 mg dose DSM265 ( cohort 3 ) . For cohort 2 , recrudescence occurs follow initial drug treatment 200 mg OZ439 , affect participant reach treatment threshold receive single 400 mg dose OZ439 . The PK/PD relationship follow drug treatment determine order characterize antimalarial activity investigational drug IBSM system use P. falciparum ( cohort 1 ; 400 mg DSM265 ) P. vivax ( cohort 2 , 200 mg OZ439 ; cohort 3 , 400 mg DSM265 ) . The treatment effect gametocytemia ( sexual blood stage detect PCR ) transmission block activity DSM265 investigate secondary objective cohort 1 ( P. falciparum infection ) . Prior drug treatment , infectivity P. vivax IBSM infection vector mosquito also investigate secondary objective Part B , cohorts 2 3 . The exposure achieve dos propose DSM265 use Part A DSM265 OZ439 Part B associate safety profile well described previous study significantly maximum tolerated exposure report either drug .</detailed_description>
