	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn use type non-invasive therapy call neurofeedback training help teach patient peripheral neuropathy change brain wave low perception neuropathy help improve overall quality life . Neurofeedback train type therapy use electroencephalograph ( EEG ) computer software program measure brain wave activity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Baseline Tests : If agree take part study , follow baseline test : - You complete 7 questionnaire symptom , feeling , general quality life . It take 20 minute complete . - Basic information ( age education level ) also collect . - You EEG measure electrical activity brain . During EEG , researcher place cap contain 19 electrode scalp 1 electrode earlobe . The electrodes measure record brain wave activity , similar way doctor listen heart beat surface skin . The EEG take 45 minute complete . Study Groups : After complete baseline test , randomly assign ( roll dice ) 1 3 study group . This do one know one study group well , , bad group . - If assign Group 1 , receive traditional neurofeedback training . Traditional neurofeedback training reward base brain 's activity . - If assign Group 2 , receive sham neurofeedback training . Sham neurofeedback training use brainwave . In sham neurofeedback , train brainwave another person neuropathy . Sham neurofeedback design help train brainwave . It design compare traditional neurofeedback learn traditional neurofeedback real effect . If question sham neurofeedback design work , talk study doctor study staff . - If assign Group 3 , continue receive standard care . You take part neurofeedback training , take part follow-up visit ( describe ) . If assign Groups 1 2 , tell receive traditional neurofeedback training sham training . Neurofeedback Training ( Groups 1 2 ) : You least 2 neurofeedback training session week 10 week ( 20 training session total ) . The training session may take place 2 day week may 5 time week , interested training quickly . The study doctor discus option training faster . Each neurofeedback training session take 1 hour complete . During session , EEG sit quietly , relax , watch computer screen . The screen blank first series picture appear . The picture change brainwave change . You may also show picture flower , bridge , mountain , . You may ask play small game , example Pac-Man type game small character move around maze . You able choose either view picture play game . When researcher see brain wave change way look , `` reward . '' When reward see pretty picture screen hear beep . A neurotherapist present session make sure fall asleep relaxed procedure . At neurofeedback training session , also ask rate neuropathic symptom scale 0-10 begin neurofeedback train session complete . This take minute . Length Participation : Your active participation study follow-up . If Groups 2 3 , may able stay study additional 4 month agree Optional Procedure # 1 ( describe ) . Follow-Up ( All group ) : Within 1 week last neurofeedback training session 1 month later : - You fill 7 questionnaire complete baseline . - You EEG . If Group 3 , EEG 1 week Â°Group 1 complete neurofeedback training . - After complete assessment 1 month later , tell group offer neurofeedback sham group . This investigational study . The equipment use neurofeedback train FDA approve commercially available . Using neurofeedback equipment teach patient way modify brain wave low perception symptom improve quality life consider investigational . Up 90 participant age 18 take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
