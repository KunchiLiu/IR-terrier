	<brief_summary>The vascular fingerprint simple selection tool identify testicular cancer patient high risk arterial cardiovascular event first year cisplatin chemotherapy . Eventually , selection method allow relative small randomize intervention study i.e . LMWH chemotherapy prove effectiveness safety lower chance arterial cardiovascular event .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vascular Fingerprint Validation Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Since introduction cisplatin late seventy ( 1 ) , prognosis metastatic testicular cancer patient dramatically improve , long-term survival rate 80-90 % ( 2 ) . However , cure rate compromise increase risk cardiovascular event ( 3-5 ) . Approximately 1-5 % patient metastatic testicular cancer develop arterial cardiovascular event shortly cisplatin- bleomycin contain chemotherapy ( 3-7 ) . Arterial cardiovascular event include ischemic stroke myocardial infarction . These arterial event source serious treatment-induced morbidity mortality recently clearly confirm Fung ( 8 ) . No established standard prophylaxis available . There unmet need possibility identify high risk patient start chemotherapy prophylactic anti-coagulant treatment may prevent event ( 9 ) . An identification tool could maximize benefit intervention without introduce much unnecessary harm : preventive intervention also carry risk . Recent data investigator ' cancer center show chemotherapy 22 % metastatic cancer patient ≥3 follow 5 traditional cardiovascular risk factor present ( high risk vascular fingerprint , figure 1 ) : overweight , smoking , hypertension , dyslipidemia impair blood glucose . These patient increase risk develop arterial event early chemotherapy : 19 % patient high risk vascular fingerprint develop arterial cardiovascular event whereas 2 % patient ≤2 risk factor develop event . The vascular fingerprint seem easy method identify metastatic testicular cancer patient high risk early arterial event may benefit prophylaxis example low molecular weight heparin ( LMWHs ) . To use clinic data need confirm independent cohort .</detailed_description>
