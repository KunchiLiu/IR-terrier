	<brief_summary>Psychological treatment effective , take long time burdensome . Therefore , avenue optimize behavioral treatment need . Despite important advancement , neuroscience limited effect psychotherapy development . Therefore , one paradigm shift would develop neuroscience inform behavioral treatment . The investigator identify literature problem affect several mental disorder ( emotion dysregulation ) neural circuit underlies important concern . They find circuit dysfunctional psychopathology change treatment . The goal one session train brain network operate efficiently test short long term effect intervention . The investigator plan engage brain network use traditional psychotherapy strategy ( cognitive restructuring ) enhance learn use repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) , neuromodulation technique magnetic stimulation enhances electrical activity brain area close scalp . The study team propose include 65 participant divide 3 group . All participant train emotion regulation first ask remember event experienced negative emotion instruct either think differently event , wait . Participants simultaneously undergo either real ( left right side brain ) sham rTMS . The investigator measure regulation lab a-week long naturalistic assessment . Participants return rate feasibility , acceptability , provide feedback . If successful , proof concept study open new frontier neuroscience inform treatment development .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neuromodulation Enhanced Cognitive Restructuring : A Proof Concept Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite significant advancement psychiatric research , majority adult mental health disorder benefit current evidence-based treatment , especially difficulty manage negative emotion . One solution unmet clinical need take neuroscience-informed approach treatment development order radically change patient care . Despite explosion research neurobiological underpinnings emotion , emotion regulation , psychopathology , attempt use finding advance behavioral treatment . Neuroscience-informed treatment development could optimize psychotherapy gain reduce burden therapist client . Therefore , propose build fundamentally novel approach treat difficulty manage negative emotion ( emotion dysregulation ) build strength current therapy , also accelerate enhances gain . Adults several different psychiatric disorder difficulty manage negative emotion , problem trace back impairment fronto-limbic brain circuitry . In healthy sample neural network activate response task require regulation emotional arousal disrupt circuit lead psychiatric symptom . In psychiatric sample , circuit underperforming evidence ( 1 ) hyperactivity amygdala ( brain structure signal emotional arousal ) , ( 2 ) slow return baseline amygdala activation , ( 3 ) hypoactivity frontal region ( responsible regulation ) , ( 3 ) insufficient cross-talk region patient experience negative emotional arousal . Evidence-based cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy neurostimulation two different intervention remediate function impair brain circuit . Both intervention evidence success change fronto-limbic network also need improvement . Therefore , investigator plan combine magnetic brain stimulation cognitive restructuring ( evidence-based behavioral treatment difficulty manage emotion ) one-session intervention . The investigator propose recruit 65 transdiagnostic adult ( i.e. , meet criterion DSM 5 disorder ) engage cognitive restructuring low frequency measure establish questionnaire randomly assign either real sham repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) . All include participant practice reduce negative emotion ( induced standardize autobiographical stressor ) use cognitive restructuring undergoing high frequency sham rTMS right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex . Standardized , establish procedure use teach cognitive restructuring , generate personalized stressor , induce negative emotional arousal , implement one session rTMS . Immediate effect evaluate use measure emotional arousal regulation intervention one week afterwards use 8 daily automate mobile phone call . Long-term effect emotion regulation , functional psychiatric impairment examine 1-week 1-month follow-up interview . The investigator hypothesize rTMS enhance cognitive restructuring yield quick reduction emotional arousal compare sham TMS , lead frequent use cognitive restructuring natural environment . If successful , study may first series investigation use innovative paradigm optimize treatment psychiatric disorder could lead next generation neuroscience-informed behavioral intervention .</detailed_description>
