	<detailed_description>Background GI symptoms extremely common patient DM , often severe consequence daily activity , ability work quality life . Moreover , GI-dysfunction cause unpredictable absorption food oral medication thus make blood-glucose difficult control oral medication less effective . Despite fact , pathophysiology diabetic bowel dysfunction scantily describe . Rational treatment GI motility disorder require detailed knowledge underlie mechanisms importance whole-gut evaluation patient motility disorder increasingly recognize . Contractions GI tract primary stimulate cholinergic parasympathetic nerve ( vagus nerve sacral nerve ) cholinergic nerve enteric nerve system locate muscle layer bowel wall . It likely cholinergic denervation major factor behind development GI dysfunction DM . Through collaboration basic physiologist clinical researcher unique international position two highly advanced method description GI innervation motility : A . [ 11C ] donepezil ( Donepezil connect carbon isotope ) PET tracer quantify density acetylcholine esterase abdominal organ , include intestinal wall . The method constitute first-ever validated scan-method vivo measure cholinergic denervation GI tract . B . 3D-Transit minimal invasive ambulant describe regional transit time contraction pattern bowel . Through study base two method aim test follow hypothesis : 1 . The [ 11C ] donepezil PET signal intestinal wall weaker normal patient DM GI symptom . 2 . Reduced [ 11C ] donepezil PET signal GI tract associate prolonged transit time stomach , small intestine colorectum patient DM . 3 . Prolonged transit time stomach , small intestine colorectum diabetic patient , least part , reversible approach normal acetylcholine esterase inhibitor treatment . 4 . Patients DM suffer severe GI symptom group objectively phenotype base regional transit time stomach , small intestine colorectum . 5 . Gastrointestinal dysfunction DM `` pan-enteric '' assessment one region insufficient clinical evaluation . Diabetes dysmotility gastrointestinal tract Autonomic neuropathy affect part GI tract , make specific diagnosis correct therapy difficult . Diabetes strongly associate nausea , vomit , diarrhea , abdominal pain , constipation fecal incontinence . The best-investigated aspect diabetic dysmotility gastroparesis . It report one third patient DM delay empty stomach . However , gastroparesis usually detect least 10 year diabetes . The pathophysiology diabetic gastroparesis still incompletely describe include lack co-coordinated contraction stomach , deficient relaxation pylorus fundus stomach relaxation . Furthermore peripheral central sensory function abnormal . Small intestine dysfunction DM scantily investigate . Thus , still unknown whether patient diabetic neuropathy primary rapid slow passage time small intestine . This important treatment two condition opposite . Autonomic enteric neuropathy diabetes The neural control GI motility complex . The essential component enteric nervous system locate bowel wall parasympathetic nerve fiber vagus nerve sacral nerve . In system acetylcholine important stimulating neurotransmitter . It well know DM may cause autonomic neuropathy affect visceral organ . Earlier study patient DM find demyelination , axonal damage reduce number motor fiber vagal nerve . However , correlation GI symptom evidence autonomic neuropathy poor . Other study report degeneration nerve fiber within enteric nervous system include Cajal cell ( pacemaker cell bowel ) . Today , assume diabetic GI dysfunction cause combination autonomic neuropathy , enteric neuropathy , dysfunction Cajal cell , reduce contractility intestinal smooth muscle cell abnormally high blood glucose . The clinical effect component unknown . Methodological limitation previous study GI dysfunction diabetes Previous study , mention , observational design change nerve muscle cell function correlate specific change bowel function . Therefore , possible evaluate functional effect neuropathy specific group neuron lack specific neurotransmitter . This important aspect address present study . Most neuron control GI motility locate myenteric plexus deeply bowel wall , available ordinary biopsy . Thus , study diabetic GI neuropathy base animal model result directly applied human . Studies GI contraction motility pattern near normal condition difficult perform subject confine hospital catheter insert . Especially , small intestine difficult access . [ 11C ] donepezil PET/CT Donepezil bind high affinity acetylcholine esterase cholinergic synapsis . Parkinson disease characterize noticeable loss parasympathetic nerve fiber . Like DM , Parkinson patient often suffer severe gastroparesis constipation . We recently validate [ 11C ] donepezil PET/CT measure density acetylcholine esterase peripheral organ . A high [ 11C ] donepezil PET signal see heart , liver , pancreas medium signal see small intestine , weak signal colon . The intensity signal correlate area know high density vagal innervation area . In study 12 patient Parkinson´s disease 12 healthy patient dramatic loss signal small intestine also measurable loss pancreas . Thus , [ 11C ] donepezil PET constitute first validate scan-method demonstrating parasympathetic denervation vivo . Subjects method We aim include 20 healthy subject 25 patient DM severe GI symptom ( nausea , vomit , abdominal discomfort , diarrhea constipation ) . Standard assessment perform prior inclusion part daily clinical practice . Persons history disease within central nervous system gastrointestinal tract history major abdominal surgery exclude . 1 . All Subjects examine [ 11C ] donepezil PET/CT compare total cholinergic innervation gut patient DM healthy . 2 . All subject examine 3D-Transit compare gastric emptying time , small intestinal transit time , colorectal transit time patient DM healthy control , Furthermore , number fast colorectal mass movement colorectal response meal compare two group . 3 . Patients DM examine 3D-Transit time second time administration acetylcholine esterase inhibitor Mestinon ( 60 mg x 4 ) determine whether abnormal transit time pattern reversible thus cause cholinergic denervation . 4 . A minority patient severe intractable constipation clinical indication Malone appendicostomy . This procedure ensure efficient empty colon rectum . These patient undergo third examination 3D-Transit . Comparing investigation first provide pilot data degree gastroparesis secondary severe constipation Health Ethics Committee Region Middle , Denmark , approve project . The protocol submit `` The Danish Health Medicines Authority '' . PET/CT [ 11C ] donepezil The total radiation dose PET/CT 7-8 millisievert ( mSv ) , correspond 2.5 year background irradiation , half ordinary diagnostic CT-scan . This radiation dose link theoretical increase risk cancer estimate 0.05 % . 3D-Transit Every capsule ( 8x21 mm ) Capsules emits electromagnetic field , convert coordinate ( x ; ; z ; Φ ; θ ) . The coordinate x ; ; z defines distance millimeter precision . Φ ; θ defines angle magnet relation sensor . The description location rotation capsule dynamic precise permit detailed description GI-contraction pattern regional passage time . Artifacts breathe physical activity record belt around thorax accelerometer detector . The 3D-Transit method without discomfort negligible risk capsule retention . The investigation ambulatory circumstance close subject 's everyday life . This considerable advantage compare traditional investigation method scintigraphy manometry . Validity , safety reproducibility data 3D-Transit publish group . The study consist four different part . The DM patient examine 1-3 DM patient able participate part 4 . The healthy subject examine first two part . 1 . 11C Donepezil PET/CT scan 2 . 3D-Transit , capsule 1 3 . 3D-Transit capsule 2 take acetylcholine esterase inhibitor ( Pyridostigmine 60 mg four time 4 hour administration . ) 4 . 3D-Transit capsule 3 Malone antegrade continence enema Each part study complete next step begin . The study participant fast study element . DM patient take morning insulin closely monitor reach blood glucoses 4-10 mmol/L The practical feasibility study The Department Endocrinology Aarhus University Hospital specific interest diabetic neuropathy patient classify accord international standard . The Department Hepatology Gastroenterology , Aarhus University Hospital special interest neurogastroenterology establish professorship field . The department close collaboration manufacturer 3D-Transit ( Motilis Medica SA , Lausanne , Switzerland ) research group London . Through ongoing collaboration among pioneer development magnet track description GI motility . The PET Center Aarhus University Hospital internationally recognize research unit field . The relevant resource available , include PET/CT scanner , radiochemical facility tracer production , software , computer scientist assistance analyze PET-data . Future perspectives 1 . Decreased cholinergic PET signal bowel wall patient suffer diabetes severe GI symptom , combination mechanistic data identify cholinergic neuropathy main cause abnormal transit pattern significant international interest improve future attempt develop targeted future treatment . 2 . Identification specific phenotype diabetic bowel dysfunction form basis large descriptive study allow future stratify treatment .</detailed_description>
