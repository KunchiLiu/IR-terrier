	<brief_title>Growth Microbiome Development Very Low Birth Weight Infants Fed Primarily Mother 's Own Milk vs. Donor Human Milk</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Human milk feed provide numerous benefit preterm infant due improvement gastrointestinal maturation , host defense , infection rate , improve long-term outcome neurodevelopment well cardiovascular metabolic disease . There accumulate evidence exclusive human milk-based diet decrease rate necrotizing enterocolitis ( NEC ) death , associate well feed tolerance low birth weight ( VLBW ) infant diet bovine milk-based product . In order provide VLBW infant benefit afford human milk feeding , use DM neonatal intensive care unit increase many mother unable provide sufficient milk need premature infant . While numerous study favorably compare feed MOM formula well study compare DM formula , relatively compare maternal milk donor milk . In regard feeding tolerance infection prevention , propose DM may less beneficial MOM due reduction biologically active component pasteurization , include human milk oligosaccharide ( HMOs ) immunological factor , growth factor , hormone . Finally , alteration intestinal microbiota preterm infant suspect contribute disease state NEC , specifically within infant decrease microbial diversity . To investigator knowledge , study compare intestinal microbiota among infant feed primarily MOM versus feed primarily DM publish . Purpose : To compare growth velocity , time reach full enteral feeding volume , intestinal microbiota , short term outcome ( NEC , late-onset sepsis , white matter injury ) infant feed primarily mother 's milk versus pasteurize donor human milk . Hypothesis : Infants feed primarily ( 50 % great ) mother 's milk increase intestinal microbiome diversity compare infant feed primarily pasteurize donor human milk . Design : This prospective cohort study conduct Level III NICU Texas Children 's Hospital - Pavilion Women Level II NICU Texas Children 's Hospital -- West Tower . Infants less 1500 g birth weight fed exclusively human milk ( mother 's milk donor breast milk ) fortify donor human milk-derived fortifier per investigator hospital guideline . Once enteral feeding establish , infant categorize cohort base percentage feeding volume consist mother 's milk , include broad categorization great 50 % maternal milk versus le 50 % , possibly tiered analysis infant receive less 25 % maternal milk , 25-75 % maternal milk , great 75 % maternal milk . An enrollment goal great 125 infant include twin multiple target adequate sample size . Procedure : Infants enrol within 72 hour birth start parenteral nutrition enteral human milk feeding per standardize feeding protocol discretion attend neonatologist service . Decisions decrease discontinue enteral feeding due medical instability make attend neonatologist . Infants preferentially feed mother ' milk available . For mother unable express adequate milk volume infant , pool , pasteurize donor human milk offer per establish NICU protocol . Feeds supplement human-milk base fortifier per protocol . At time initial consent study , mother also ask consent obtain small sample ( 0.2-0.5 mL ) colostrum express milk produce first week life , well weekly milk sample thereafter , order analyze bacterial content milk compare develop infant microbiome . However , consent milk collection require infant 's participation study . For infant receive primarily donor milk , weekly sample milk receive may similarly analyze bacterial content . Infant stool sample collect first week life weekly interval six week research purpose . The sample analyze via 16S rRNA sequence determine diversity intestinal microbiota . Additional analysis metabolomics consider lab availability cost allows . Once weekly , research nurse physician document growth measurement , include weight , length , head circumference . Outcome data infant ' medical record record , include time regain birth weight , feed tolerance indicated time require reach full enteral feed volume 100 ml/kg/day ( hydration ) 130-160 ml/kg/day ( final goal volume nutrition ) , rate NEC , spontaneous intestinal perforation ( SIP ) , late-onset sepsis , bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD ) . As preterm infant less 1000 g birth weight bear TCH-PFW routinely perform brain MRIs term gestation hospital discharge , enrol infant fall subgroup MRI result review outcome analysis . Additional medical record data collection include mechanism delivery ( cesarean vs. vaginal ) , antibiotic receive mother 2nd 3rd trimester well time delivery nursing/expressing milk , antibiotic receive baby hospitalization , length hospitalization , postmenstrual age discharge , day NPO , day parenteral nutrition , percentage patient patent ductus arteriosus , rate intraventricular hemorrhage , retinopathy prematurity , death . Although long-term follow currently design study , time initial enrollment optional consent allow study personnel access medical record patient go neurodevelopmental follow visit clinic within investigator institution . There also optional consent family contact infant approximately 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 month developmental follow . This allow possible comparison neurodevelopmental outcomes approximately 18-24 month subgroup patient whose mother consent aspect study . No lab request research purpose . No intervention part protocol .</detailed_description>
