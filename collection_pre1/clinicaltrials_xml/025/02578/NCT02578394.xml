	<brief_summary>The aim study determine feasibility run phase III double-blind , double-dummy randomise control trial compare Depo-Medrone 120mg intramuscular injection vs. Anakinra 100mg subcutaneous injection 5 day treatment acute gout attack patient chronic kidney disease define eGFR &lt; 60mls/min/1.73m2 ≥ 30mls/min/1.73m2 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Anakinra vs. Steroids Treatment Gout Attacks Patients With Renal Disease ( ASGARD ) : A Feasibility Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gout common condition affect 1 40 people UK . It cause painful `` attack '' joint swelling , redness tenderness , mostly affect foot , ankle , knee , hand wrist . It common people kidney disease , also tend old people medical condition high blood pressure , heart disease diabetes . The investigator know safe best way treat gout attack increase cohort people . A lot people give treatment worsen kidney disease , along medical condition . The investigator want compare safe treatment currently available , steroid , new treatment call Anakinra . This treatment stop action chemical call interleukin-1 discover play important role gout attack . This treatment already use treat gout attack handful patient kidney disease . The investigator feel may well alternative steroid treatment sometime worsen diabetes , heart disease blood pressure . Participants predominantly followed-up one week final 8 week follow-up , recruit hospital East England . A definitive scientific study compare two treatment would involve big expensive study require large number patient large amount information collect . Before investigator big study like , investigator want perform small study use small number patient ( 32 patient ) period 22 month total . It give u information plan large study answer question treatment may better , safe provide value money NHS .</detailed_description>

Male nonpregnant , nonnursing female 3 . ≥ 18 year age 4. eGFR &lt; 60mls/min/1.73m2 ≥ 30mls/min/1.73m2 calculate use serum creatinine modify MDRD formula per renal association guideline . 5 . Diagnosis gout arthritis define American College Rheumatology 1977 preliminary criterion ( criterion currently endorse NICE guideline ) . 6 . Gout flare less ≤ 36 hour 7 . Baseline pain intensity &gt; equal 50mm 0100 mm VAS . In case multiple joint ( ≤ 3 ) , affect joint assess . 1 . Treatment NSAIDS last 48 hour , systemic steroid last 4 week colchicine within 7 day . 2 . Polyarticular gout , i.e . affect four 4 joint 3 . Rheumatoid arthritis , evidence/suspicion infectious/septic arthritis , acute inflammatory arthritis systemic lupus erythematosus , mixed connective tissue disease , scleroderma , polymyositis , significant systemic involvement secondary rheumatoid arthritis . 4 . Concurrent immunosuppression/immunomodulatory treatment ( Calcineurin inhibitor , antiproliferative biologic ) therapy reason i.e . organ transplant . 5 . Prior history current inflammatory joint disease gout ( e.g . rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) , reactive arthritis , psoriatic arthritis , seronegative spondyloarthropathy , Lyme disease ) . Concurrent medication RA like methotrexate antiTNF treatment associate increase risk neutropenia infection . 6 .
