	<brief_title>Study Standard Maintenance POMP/D Plus Ixazomib Maintenance Therapy Adult Patients With Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia , Lymphoblastic Lymphoma Mixed Phenotype Acute Leukemia Complete Remission ( CR )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE The primary objective determine maximum-tolerated dose IXAZOMIB ( MLN9708 ) ( maximum 4 mg , recommend phase II dose IXAZOMIB ( MLN9708 ) combination standard maintenance therapy POMP/D ( methotrexate , 6- mercaptopurine , vincristine , prednisone/dexamethasone ) ass tolerability POMP/D IXAZOMIB ( MLN9708 ) maintenance adult patient acute lymphoblastic leukemia , lymphoblastic lymphoma ( LBL ) mix phenotype acute leukemia ( MPAL ) complete remission ( CR ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVE To determine three-year progression-free survival ( PFS ) patient treated oral IXAZOMIB ( MLN9708 ) standard maintenance regimen . Progression-free survival measure start induction disease relapse . STUDY DESIGN The maximum-tolerated dose single agent IXAZOMIB 1.76 2.0mg/m2 give twice week schedule1 &gt; 2.34 mg/m2 2.97 mg/m2 weekly schedule previous study . Three patient treat per dose level unless dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) observe . The start dose IXAZOMIB 3 mg orally day 1 , 8 15 . If DLT see first three patient , dose increase 4 mg day 1 , 8 15 classic 3 +3 phase I design . We attempt increase dose beyond 4 mg orally , achieve acceptable toxicity , would accept recommended phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) . Zero three DLTs would allow escalation next dose level . One three DLTs require expand six patient ; one six DLTs allow escalation . Two DLTs require dose de-escalation . The maximum-tolerated dose ( MTD ) high dose administer one DLT observe .</detailed_description>
