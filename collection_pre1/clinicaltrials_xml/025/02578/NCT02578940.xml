	<criteria>The subject original diagnosis PCa underwent radical curative therapy least 3 month enrolment , diagnosed biochemical recurrence ( BCR ) basis : 1 . Post radical radiotherapy ( RRT ) / brachytherapy : Increase PSA level ≥2.0 ng/mL nadir level radiotherapy ( RT ) brachytherapy ( ASTROPhoenix criterion ) [ 53 ] , 2 . Post radical prostatectomy ( RP ) : EITHER two consecutive rise PSA final PSA &gt; 0.1ng/ml OR three consecutive rise PSA. , This definition also applicable subject PSA persistence post RP ( PSA fail fall undetectable level ) . . In addition , subject post RP , PSA double time ≤15 month OR PSA level ≥1.0 ng/mL time recruitment . The PSA doubling time calculate use Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center nomogram ( http : //www.mskcc.org/nomograms/prostate/psadoublingtime ) , base minimum two PSA level within 12 month screen , take last recorded nadir PSA available time screen . The subject previous recurrence PCa , i.e . first diagnosis BCR . The subject consider radical salvage therapy . The subject able willing comply study procedure , sign , date time informed consent obtain studyrelated procedure perform . The subject 's Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ ECOG ] performance status 02 . The subject receive androgendeprivation therapy within 3 month screen . The subject normal clinically acceptable medical history vital sign finding screen ( 14 day administration study drug ) . The subject previously include study .
