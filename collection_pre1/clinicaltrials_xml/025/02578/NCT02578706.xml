	<brief_summary>Advances antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) result increased survival HIV-infected population ; however , gain longevity associate increase risk cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . Although ART traditional risk factor contribute CVD population , heighten marker immune activation , inflammation , coagulation independently predict morbidity mortality , suggest dysregulation system play significant role increase risk CVD . The investigator believe platelet activation important driver HIV-associated immune activation , inflammation , coagulation , lead increase CVD pathophysiology risk . Platelets initiate thrombus formation also play key role vascular inflammation release pro-inflammatory mediator cross-talking relevant cell type include leukocyte . Researchers describe platelet hyperreactivity chronic HIV infection . Importantly , investigator demonstrate one week anti-platelet therapy ( aspirin ) decrease platelet activation immune activation , improve trend inflammation immune parameter . The overall hypothesis platelet activation major driver immune activation , inflammation , thrombosis ART-treated HIV infect patient . The purpose propose proof-of-concept study understand mechanism ( ) anti-platelet therapy improve immune inflammatory parameter chronic HIV infection . To test , immune modulate anti-inflammatory effect 24 week anti-platelet drug aspirin compare anti-platelet drug clopidogrel evaluate . Given different mechanism action inhibitory potency , investigator differentiate whether potential benefit mediate via inhibition arachidonic acid ( aspirin ) inhibition ADP ( clopidogrel ) antithrombotic activity . A secondary goal perform multidimensional assay platelet activity thrombogenicity alongside immune activation assay careful assessment traditional risk factor medication regimen , understand parameter highly associate thrombogenicity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial 40 HIV-1 infected participant stable ART randomize 1:1:1 ratio aspirin 81mg daily v clopidogrel 75mg daily v placebo 24 week . A subset patient arm participate sub-study evaluate thrombogenicity , perform prior first study treatment 24 week study treatment . 10 HIV uninfected control subject participate study evaluate baseline characteristic . The primary endpoint determine impact aspirin compare clopidogrel immune activation inflammation HIV infect , ART treat adult . This determine measure change clinically relevant soluble marker inflammation sCD14 24 week study drug . Secondary objective measure safety tolerability , measure effect study drug important soluble marker inflammation ( sCD163 , IL-6 , d-dimer , sTNFRI II ) , measure monocyte subset ( CD14 , CD16 , CD69 ) , measure platelet activation light transmission aggregometry , monocyte-platelet aggregate , soluble CD40L , measure clot formation kinetics thromboelastography , subset patient , measure thrombogenicity Badimon Chamber cholesterol uptake monocyte .</detailed_description>
