	<detailed_description>This 12-month , single-arm , cross-over study pediatric adolescent patient SCD prescribe HU Nationwide Children 's Hospital order compare HU adherence prior study , Mobile Dot use use Mobile DOT . Hydroxyurea ( HU ) disease-modifying medication patient sickle cell disease ( SCD ) . Multiple clinical trial show HU reduce SCD-related complication 50 % pediatric patient adhere HU rate achieve clinical trial . This poor adherence limit clinical effectiveness result increase cost low patient-reported quality life . An innovative , practical , inexpensive , efficient strategy need improve HU adherence pediatric patient SCD . Electronic directly observe therapy ( Mobile DOT ) pilot-tested , multi-dimensional tool feasible acceptable strategy achieve &gt; 90 % HU adherence rate small cohort pediatric patient SCD . This study provide test confirm Mobile DOT improve adherence improve clinical outcome patient SCD . Mobile DOT use patient ' smart phone computer provide electronic reminder alert video-record patient ' daily HU administration . Patients provide text ( SMS ) message , e-mail , phone call communication encourage adherence receive monetary incentive reach adherence goal . Researchers determine video adherence correlate self-report , biomarker , refill adherence .
