	<detailed_description>This open-label ( study drug , procedure know participant investigator ) , multicenter , Phase 1b study investigate effect apalutamide ventricular repolarization dose level 240 milligram ( mg daily ) . Approximately 42 participant high-risk non-metastatic prostate cancer ( NM-CRPC ) , define prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) double time le equal ( &lt; = ) 10 month , participant metastatic CRPC enrol . The study consist 28-day Screening Phase , Treatment Phase Follow-up Phase . In Treatment Phase study drug administrate cycle 28 day participant monitor safety ( include cardiac safety ) pharmacokinetics study drug . Adverse Events monitor throughout study Follow-up Phase 30 day last dose study drug . All participant continue study disease progression , withdrawal consent , lose follow-up , occurrence unacceptable toxicity , participant longer receive clinical benefit opinion investigator , termination study sponsor . Upon discontinuation study drug , participant return End-of-Treatment ( EoT ) visit later 30 day last dose . The end study define 30 day last participant ' last dose study drug .</detailed_description>
