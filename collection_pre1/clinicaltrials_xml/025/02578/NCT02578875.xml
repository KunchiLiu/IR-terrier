	<brief_summary>Background : Researchers test new way find causes infection people hospital . Current technique use chemical biological test person sample . Samples blood , tissue , stool , saliva , urine , etc . Researchers test new technique use device call MiSeq . It sequence DNA ( genetic material ) sample . This may show microorganism , bacteria , fungi , virus cause infection . Researchers want know new test work well well current test . They look 250 sample . Objective : To test MiSeq work well well current test identify microorganism cause infection . Eligibility : NIH patient whose sample send Microbiology Service lab routine microbiologic test . Design : Participants consent sample give part routine medical care use study . For age 18 , parent legal guardian consent .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation MiSeq Microbial Identification Specimens</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study evaluate optimize test uses next-generation DNA sequencing instrument , Illumina MiSeq , along associate computer infrastructure bioinformatics software require sequence analysis . This system ultimately intend use NIH Clinical Center Department Laboratory Medicine identify infectious agent primary patient specimen . Next generation sequence technique base sequence total DNA primary specimen expect many advantage classical microbiological approach . These include detection pathogen directly primary specimen may difficult impossible culture . In study , discard patient sample autopsy material test MiSeq system identify classify bacteria , virus , pathogen . For purpose study , term sample refer sample swab , tissue biopsy , blood , feces , saliva , urine , wound , etc . The investigator analyze sequence result blind microbiology culture result validation subset specimen test MiSeq system . The result MiSeq analysis convert form compare Microbiology Services official culture result store laboratory information system ( software SCC SOFT Computer [ Clearwater , FL , USA ] ) .</detailed_description>
