	<brief_summary>Surgical site infection ( SSIs ) complicate 5 - 12 % cesarean . Negative pressure wound therapy ( NPWT ) - close , sealed system applies negative pressure wind surface - use treat open wound since late 1990s . Experimental evidence suggest NPWT promote wound heal remove exudate , approximate wound edge , reduce bacterial contamination . Although effectiveness prophylactic NPWT biologically plausible non-randomized study suggest benefit reduce SSIs , good quality data lacking . The objective pilot randomize control trial 120 patient test hypothesis prophylactic NPWT reduce SSIs wound complication cesarean obese woman . The investigator randomly assign obese woman undergo cesarean delivery Standard dress prophylactic NPWT PICO system skin closure . The primary outcome composite superficial deep SSIs per Centers Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ) criteria wound complication ( separation , hematoma , seroma ) cesarean . Secondary outcome include wound dehiscence ( ≥2 cm ) ; hematoma ; seroma ; composite wound complication ; patient pain satisfaction score ; physician office visit emergency department ( ED ) visit SSIs ; hospital readmission wound complication .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Overview Proposed Trial This pilot randomize control trial . The investigator choose randomize controlled trial , 'gold standard ' clinical research design , goal obtain high quality evidence inform clinical practice . Randomly allocate subject different intervention minimize selection bias result group comparable regard important confounding variable , measure unmeasured . Additionally , broad inclusion criterion , simplicity intervention , evaluation effect typical use prophylactic NPWT make pragmatic trial . The investigator follow Consolidated Standards Reporting Trials ( CONSORT ) guideline conduct report trial . We use computer-generated block randomization stratify study site BMI category assign participant two intervention . All subject receive standard infection prevention measure include skin antisepsis weight-adjusted prophylactic antibiotic . Analysis follow intention-to-treat principle . The use broad inclusion criterion intention-to-treat analysis allow conservative estimate effect prophylactic NPWT allow good estimate effectiveness public health implication practice change would pure estimate efficacy alone . Conduct Trial Recruitment study subject : All woman admit labor delivery unit participate medical center screen inclusion exclusion criterion . Eligible subject approach trained research staff write consent participate study . Subjects randomize decision make cesarean delivery . Randomization allocation concealment : Enrolled subject randomly assign 1:1 ratio NPWT standard care use computer-generated random sequence generate study statistician . A subject 's group assignment reveal decision make perform cesarean delivery . Blinding : Although blind subject physician would ideal , blind possible trial . We minimize systematic bias apply standard infection prevention measure patient site . Further , research personnel collect outcomes data blind group assignment subject standard dress NPWT device remove . Importantly , diagnosis primary outcome objectively review centrally PI blind fashion use CDC criterion . Interventions : The intervention compare trial standard care versus prophylactic NPWT skin closure : 1 . Standard care : Women assign standard care receive routine postoperative wound dress consist layer gauze adhesive tap . The dress remove 24 - 48 hour . 2 . Prophylactic NPWT : Women assign prophylactic NPWT PICO device apply secure fixation adhesion strip . The device monitor patient hospital confirm function well . The device remove prior discharge , typically postoperative day 4 . Rationale choose PICO : There head-to-head trial two FDA-cleared prophylactic NPWT device , preliminary data suggest one superior . However , large price difference : $ 200 per PICO unit $ 500 per Prevena unit . The investigator choose less expensive device . Data Collection : The investigator collect detailed antepartum , intrapartum , postpartum information study participant . Relevant data collect initially assess eligibility . Complete baseline information outcome data collect trained study nurse direct interview chart review . Hypothesis Testing Primary Aim : Determine effectiveness prophylactic NPWT reduce rate SSIs wound complication cesarean obese woman . Hypothesis : Obese woman low rate SSIs wound complication cesarean use prophylactic NPWT standard care . Primary outcome : The primary outcome trial superficial deep SSIs wound complication ( separation , hematoma , seroma ) cesarean . This define accord CDC criterion infection surgical site occur within 30 day cesarean delivery , classify superficial , deep , organ/space occupy . We use active surveillance SSIs include one patient phone call research coordinator within 30 day surgery . The PI blindly review de-identified inpatient outpatient record subject suspect SSIs CDC criterion ensure standard diagnosis classification . Secondary outcome : Wound dehiscence ( ≥2 cm ) ; hematoma ; seroma ; composite wound complication ; patient pain satisfaction score ( scale 0 10 ) discharge postoperative day 14 ( ±2 day ) 28 ( ±2 day ) ; physician office visit ED visit SSIs ; hospital readmission SSIs . Sample size calculation : The sample size pilot trial 120 ; 60 prophylactic NPWT group 60 standard treatment group . We estimate sample size trial assume baseline SSI wound complication rate 24 % base recent trial institution , clinically significant 75 % reduction effect size base recently publish study . CDC Criteria define classify surgical site infection ( SSIs ) : 1 . Superficial incisional ( wound ) infection infection occur within 30 day operative procedure ; AND involve skin subcutaneous tissue incision ; AND patient least one following : 1. purulent drainage superficial incision , 2. organism isolate aseptically-obtained culture superficial incision subcutaneous tissue , 3. superficial incision deliberately open surgeon , attend physician designee culture-positive culture ; patient least one follow sign symptom : pain tenderness ; localize swelling ; erythema ; heat . A culture-negative finding meet criterion , 4. diagnosis superficial incisional SSI surgeon attend physician designee . 2 . Deep incisional ( wound ) infection Infection occur within 30 day operative procedure ; AND involve deep soft tissue incision ( e.g. , fascial muscle layer ) ; AND patient least one following : 1. purulent drainage deep incision , 2. deep incision spontaneously dehisces , deliberately open aspirate surgeon , attend physician designee culture-positive culture ; patient least one follow sign symptom : fever ( &gt; 38°C ) , localize pain , tenderness . A culture-negative finding meet criterion , 3. abscess evidence infection involve deep incision detect gross anatomical histopathologic exam , image test . 3 . Organ/Space ( endometritis , abscess ) Infection occur within 30 day operative procedure ; AND infection involves part body deep fascial/muscle layer , open manipulate operative procedure ; AND patient least one following : 1. purulent drainage drain place organ/space ( e.g. , close suction drainage system , open drain , T-tube drain , CT-guided drainage ) , 2. organism isolate aseptically-obtained culture fluid tissue organ/space , 3. abscess evidence infection involve organ/space detect gross anatomical histopathologic exam , image test ; AND meet least one criterion specific organ/space infection site . Secondary Aim 1 : Assess safety prophylactic NPWT obese woman measure frequency adverse event include skin blister , erythema , wound bleed prolong wound drainage . Hypothesis : The rate adverse event significantly high use prophylactic NPWT standard care . Outcomes secondary aim 1 : Composite adverse event potentially attributable NPWT include skin blister , erythema , wound bleeding , prolong ( &gt; 7 day ) wind drainage . Rationale : NPWT associate adverse event include skin blister , wound bleeding , prolong wound drainage . A high rate skin blister report NPWT use orthopedic surgery . This attribute use adhesive dress set marked swell edema . Although adverse event note NPWT cesarean generally minor comparable frequency use standard dressing , essential characterize frequency event permit risk-benefit counseling patient . Secondary Aim 2 : Determine effect prophylactic NPWT frequency identity bacteria , include antibiotic-resistant organism , isolated SSIs cesarean obese woman . Hypothesis : Prophylactic NPWT associate reduction rate positive wound culture antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolate SSIs cesarean . Outcomes secondary aim 2 : Rate positive wound culture proportion specific organism , especially drug-resistant bacteria ( e.g . MRSA ) isolate SSIs cesarean . Wound culture antimicrobial sensitivity testing : Physicians follow clinical protocol warrant collection swab accessible SSIs routine aerobic anaerobic culture . Data Analysis Plan Overview : Data analysis adhere closely CONSORT guideline . Analyses follow intention-to-treat principle subject analyze group randomize , regardless whether receive assigned intervention . Primary Analysis : Descriptive statistic characterize group individual recruit investigate comparability two group baseline . Formal statistical test limited select baseline characteristic consider prognostic factor primary outcome emergent cesarean , type skin incision , prolonged rupture membrane . The categorical prognostic factor compare trial group use Fisher 's exact test . Continuous prognostic factor compare use Mann-Whitney U test . The primary outcome categorical secondary outcome compare intervention group use Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test.The investigator calculate common relative risk 95 % confidence interval associate primary secondary outcome . The investigator also conduct time-to-event analysis use Kaplan Meier Cox regression model examine pattern SSIs two group . Secondary Analyses : The investigator perform analysis aim obtain adjust estimate treatment effectiveness , adjust baseline subject characteristic ( covariates ) . The objective analysis estimate influence covariates outcome use covariates improve estimate difference treatment group . Stepwise logistic regression model use identify estimate effect multiple prognostic factor probability SSI categorical outcome . Interaction test use determine whether effectiveness prophylactic NPWT differs across subgroup BMI category type skin incision . These secondary analysis consider exploratory . Safety monitor The intervention compare trial currently use clinical obstetric practice . Further , adverse event report use prophylactic NPWT cesarean minor frequency comparable rate standard dressing . Therefore , serious life-threatening adverse event expect . Nonetheless , follow measure take monitor investigate adverse event : 1 . Adverse event reporting : Detailed information concern adverse event collect evaluate throughout trial . If participant develops adverse event , participant 's physician PI ascertain safety continue intervention . 2 . Interim analysis : The investigator anticipate one interim analyse 60 patient recruit . Although early stopping decision base purely mathematical stopping rule , use Haybittle-Peto stopping rule guide . Under rule , interim analysis primary outcome would demonstrate extreme difference group ( P &lt; 0.001 ) justify premature disclosure . This rule advantage exact number interim analysis need specify advance overall type I error preserved 0.05 ; therefore , sample size adjustment need .</detailed_description>
