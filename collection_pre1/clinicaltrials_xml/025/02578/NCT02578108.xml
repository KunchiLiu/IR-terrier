	<brief_summary>Chronic painful knee OA major cause disability old adult . In patient whose symptoms refractory conservative management wish undergo TKA , alternatively , operative candidate , genicular nerve RFA represent promise treatment option . Investigators determine patient chronic painful knee osteoarthritis experience meaningful long-term improvement pain , function , analgesic use , well prevention TKA RFA genicular nerve . Investigators also determine whether zero versus one set diagnostic genicular nerve block Answering question help determine genicular nerve RFA indeed worthwhile treatment chronic painful knee OA . Additionally , help determine optimal diagnostic protocol patient selection procedure , implication improve treatment success rate , prevent unnecessary procedure , decrease healthcare cost saving .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Knee osteoarthritis ( OA ) one common condition cause disability old adult , estimate prevalence symptom 20-30 % individual 65 year age . Pain associate knee OA may central nervous system component , intra-articular chemical pain mediator Substance P Calcitonin-gene related peptide , possible intra-articular ischemic pain due vasospasm , mechanical compression irritation richly innervated subchondral bone , periosteum , synovium , joint capsule , well peripheral genicular nerve sensitization largely implicate . Knee OA , general , treat conservatively weight loss ( indicate ) , physical therapy , oral analgesic medication , intra-articular corticosteroid hyaluronic acid injection . If approach fail provide adequate pain relief functional restoration , patient may offer total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) , surgical candidate . While , TKA generally safe procedure , like major open surgery , associate risk serious complication ; large cohort study 83,756 patient demonstrated annual incidence venous thromboembolism ( 0.6 % ) , myocardial infarction ( 0.5 % ) , stroke ( 0.5 % ) , 90 day mortality ( 0.7 % ) significantly high general population . Furthermore , patient candidate TKA due co-morbidities morbid obesity cardiopulmonary disease . Radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) knee joint denervation represent promise intervention patient chronic painful knee osteoarthritis fail conservative management either willing eligible TKA . During RFA thermal lesion create apply radiofrequency energy electrode place target structure . RFA use disrupt sensory afferent nociceptive nerve fiber supply zygapophyseal ( facet ) joint spine well sacroiliac joint excellent pain reduction functional improvement perform appropriately . To date , two publish study investigate knee joint denervation RFA treatment chronic painful OA . In randomized prospective study ( n=35 ) , Choi et al . find genicular nerve RFA result clinically meaningful pain improvement approximately 60 % patient 6 month follow-up . Improvement function also observe . Bellini Barbieri report series 3 patient chronic painful knee OA , two experience meaningful pain functional improvement genicular nerve RFA . There evidence-based algorithm establish provide mean properly select patient would benefit genicular nerve RFA . In study perform Choi et al. , one set diagnostic genicular nerve block threshold 50 % pain relief consider `` positive response '' use . In contrast , well developed literature regard selection patient medial branch RFA facet-mediated pain indicate two set diagnostic medial branch nerve block threshold &gt; 80 % pain reduction consider `` positive response '' increase positive predictive value meaningful pain functional outcome 80-90 % . While diagnosis facet-mediated pain challenge give variety potential pain generator spine , diagnostic uncertainly far less likely evaluate knee pain generator . In fact , unclear diagnostic block genicular nerve need give increase potential complication healthcare cost compare proceed directly ablation procedure . It vital evidence-based selection criterion develop genicular nerve RFA order optimize clinical outcome minimize healthcare cost .</detailed_description>
