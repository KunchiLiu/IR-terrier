	<detailed_description>Emotional disorder ( ED ) ( anxiety mood disorder ) among prevalent mental disorder , life prevalence 29 % comorbidity rate range 40 80 % . If adequately treated course often chronic , significantly affect important function area work social relationship . Thus , data strongly suggest efficacious efficient treatment need order address important health problem . The classification differentiation mental disorder carry manual like DSM ICD play important role emphasis place research treatment specific disorder ; however , also problem dissemination evidenced-based treatment due difficulty train clinician variety available disorder-specific program . In hand , Evidence-based psychological treatment ( EBPT ) show efficacy treatment ED , however , less 50 % people ED receive treatment cause include cost , time application lack well-trained professional . In addition , epidemiological study show least 55 % people suffer anxiety disorder suffer another anxiety disorder moment assessment , prevalence rate 76 % different lifespan diagnose take account . This high comorbidity rate indicate different ED share important characteristic propose overlap accounted common biological psychological vulnerability along psychosocial stress factor lead different manifestation vulnerability , i. e. , different mood anxiety disorder . Thus , Transdiagnostic approach could help overcome barrier . Transdiagnostic approach implication treatment psychological disorder number treatment protocol develop base perspective . Clark distinguish three perspective transdiagnostic cognitive-behavioral therapy : ) The transdiagnostic practice , pragmatic perspective include component various disorder-specific intervention protocol whose aim determine active component sample disorder . The contribution Norton , Andrews Titov , study : Coordinated Anxiety Learning Management ( CALM ) belong category . b ) The transdiagnostic theory , specifies theoretical framework outline common psychological construct influence maintenance ED . For instance , tripartite model anxiety depression , positive negative affect relevant construct . c ) The Unified Protocol . The Barlow 's team design protocol , adequate treatment ED focus four essential aspect : increase present-focused emotional awareness , identify modify emotional avoidance pattern , promote cognitive flexibility facilitate exposure avoid situation sensation . Another aspect could enhance dissemination evidence-based treatment well considerably reduce cost use Internet . A number sistematic review show Internet-based treatment yield similar result compare face-to-face therapy . Nevertheless , program focus single disorder since transdiagostic internet-based treatment develop tested mean randomize controlled trial far . The main objective treatment component UP train patient regulation negative emotion negative affect ( NA ) , less attention pay inclusion treatment component directly target positive affect ( PA ) regulation . Investigators research group ( LabPsiTec ) develop traditional transdiagnostic treatment partly base UP add specific component positive affect regulation order directly target regulation positive affect . The study include three condition : 1 ) Transdiagnostic protocol ( TP ) ; 2 ) Transdiagnostic protocol + positive affect component ( TP+PA ) ; 3 ) Waiting list control group ( WL ) . The main hypothesis modality protocol ( TP TP+PA ) result effective WL condition primary outcome measure . Investigators expect score positive affect high TP+PA condition TP condition .</detailed_description>
