	<brief_summary>The optimal method total knee replacement component fixation bone remain challenge . The use bone cement consider gold standard prefer technique surgeon . However , uncemented fixation method develop attempt tackle problem see cement use . The cement-bone interlock deform degrade year lead aseptic loosening , especially young active patient . A loosened prosthesis result impair function painful knee daily life revision prosthesis may necessary . To prevent aseptic loosening subsequent revision surgery , new method uncemented fixation develop . One method use highly porous metal call Tritanium® . It improve biologic fixation resemble characteristic trabecular bone . It expect surface aid bone ingrowth similar even good result concern early fixation property long-term durability compare cemented fixation . Excellent result use highly porous Tritanium see total hip surgery already . This single-blinded , randomized clinical trial ass clinical radiological outcome include Roentgen Stereophotogrammetry ( RSA ) measurements newly approve uncemented Triathlon Tritanium CR total knee prosthesis compare standard cement Triathlon metal-backed CR total knee prosthesis ( Stryker Orthopaedics ) . Two arm 35 patient include . The primary outcome measure prosthetic migration two year uncemented Triathlon Tritanium CR Total Knee cement Triathlon CR Total Knee mean RSA . It hypothesize new uncemented Tritanium prosthesis perform least equally good term migration clinical parameter compare standard cement Triathlon . The secondary outcome measure long-term ( 10-year ) survival base two-year migration pattern combine clinical factor radiographic aspect . In order identify clinical parameter besides fixation prosthesis component , clinical score radiographic aspect correlate RSA outcome . The 10-year result use verify predicted long-term survival result .</brief_summary>
