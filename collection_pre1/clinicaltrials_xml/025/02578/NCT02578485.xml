	<brief_summary>Background : The active video game ( VGA ) study much physiological factor practice . The objective determine whether AVG session promote post-exercise hypotension ( PEH ) similar walking exercise . Methods : Fifteen hypertensive ( 49.0 ± 1.6 year ) , gender perform five randomized session , last 60 minute : 1 ) AVG , 2 ) sedentary video game ( SVG ) , 3 ) walk treadmill moderate intensity ( WMI ) , 4 ) walk treadmill similar intensity VGA ( WGI ) , 5 ) control without exercise ( CON ) . Intensity determine Heart rate ( HR ) Perceived Exertion ( PE ) . Blood pressure ( BP ) cardiac autonomic modulation ( CAM ) measurement take rest every 10 minute post exercise 60 minute .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Single Session Active Video Game Promotes Post Exercise Hypotension Middle-aged Hypertensive</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Volunteers study Participated study 15 hypertensive patient gender , five men . All participant obese grade I use drug therapy . Were adopt inclusion criterion : 1 ) hypertensive ; 2 ) age 45 59 year old 3 ) perform regular exercise ; 4 ) use beta-blockers drug calcium channel blocker ; 5 ) affect labyrinthitis ; 6 ) woman menopause , , 4 ) practitioner VGA . Already exclusion criterion : 1 ) modify antihypertensive treatment treatment ; 2 ) Not develop ability play adaptation period . This study approve Ethics Research Committee University Hospital Lauro Wanderley protocol nº 201/11 subject clear procedure study , subject ask sign Term Free Informed Consent ( TFIC ) accord Resolution 196/96 National Health Council . Study Design The subject submit five protocol last 60 minute : 1- Game VGA ( Dance Dance Revolution ® ) ; 2- Walking/running reproducing intensity obtain session VGA ; 3- Walking/running intensity 60 % 85 % MHR ; 4- sedentary video game ( VGS ) 5- A session control without exercise ( CON ) , participant remain rest . The order session determine randomly carry minimum 48 hour . The intensity monitor measurement HR PE . BP cardiac autonomic modulation ( CAM ) assess period 60 minute exercise , interval 10 minute measurement . Adaptation game instruction study Before start experimental protocol , volunteer perform three session adaptation 20 minute duration . In session , instruct proper way handle VGA VGS instrument , pass necessary guidance different direction arrow use game . These three session prove sufficient understand dynamic two game obtain enough coordination play without interruption . After adaptation period , schedule make voluntary experimental procedure instruct drink caffeine-containing food drink alcoholic beverage least 48 hour experimental session . AVG SVG procedures The VGA utilized Dance Dance Revolution® ( SSD Company Ltd. , Shiga , Japan ) Playstation 2® ( San Mateo , CA , USA ) . In VGA practitioner simulates synchronize dance footstep order carpet ( matpad ) contain area trodden replace traditional button control VGS . The style music use game similar use gym . The game consist pass arrow four direction appear screen randomly rhythm different song contain game . When arrows pas screen , player must step correspond arrow carpet , music rhythm . At end music , immediately next music select minimize time interval . Was connect video game multimedia projector use screen , play game image . The VGS game VGA , difference carpet replace joystick volunteer remain seated game . Both session VGA VGS last 60 minute . Heart rate measure every 10 min use um heart rate monitor ( Polar ® brand , model RS800CX , Polar ElectroOy , Kempele , Finland ) . Aerobic Exercise Protocol The subject perform two aerobic exercise session last 60 minute treadmill ( Moviment® LX160i - Brudden LTDA , Amazon , Brazil ) . One session perform intensity similar intensity reach session VGA session perform moderate intensity ( range 60 % 85 % maximum reserve heart rate ) . Heart rate monitor heart rate monitor ( Polar ® brand , model RS800CX , Polar ElectroOy , Kempele , Finland ) every 10 minute ensure volunteer maintain predetermined intensity exercise treadmill . For exercise protocol treadmill intensity AVG , low high measured heart rate find video game adopt target zone heart rate treadmill . To protocol moderate intensity , target heart rate determine accord equation ( equation 1 ) propose Karvonen , et al.20 : Equation I FCT = FCR + % ( FCM-FCR ) , FCT= heart rate training ; FCR = heart rate rest ; ; FCM = Maximum heart rate ; % = train intensity During rest period Subjective Perception Scale Borg effort 21 presented subject indices 6-20 subject become acquainted fatigue stage mild exhaustive . During game exercise treadmill , PE question every 10 minute . Blood Pressure Monitoring After arrival subject data collection site , instruct remain seat 10 minute quiet room , illuminate controlled temperature 295,1ºC 298,1ºC measure baseline BP . New BP measurement take immediately end exercise 60 minute post exercise video game procedure recovery every 10 minute . BP measure auscultation , follow strictly protocol propose VI Brazilian Guidelines Hypertension22 . For Was use aneroid sphygmomanometer ( WelkinAlllyn® , Skaneateles Falls , New York , USA ) accuracy two millimeter mercury previously calibrate mercury column stethoscope Premiun® mark ( G-Tech ) . Cardiac Autonomic Modulation ( CAM ) CAM determine record variability RR interval HR , use hear rate monitor Polar ® RS800CX ( Polar ElectroOy , Kempele , Finland ) . The CAM record 10 minute initial rest recovery post treadmill video game procedures 60 minute every 10 minute . Each measure last five minute . Data transport infrared device computer provide software manufacturer . The data analyze frequency domain ( sympathetic-vagal balance - LF / HF ) software Kubios ( University Eastern Finland , Kuopio , Finland ) .</detailed_description>
