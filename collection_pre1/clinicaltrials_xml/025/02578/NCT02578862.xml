	<brief_summary>Utilization total intravenous anesthesia ( TIVA ) propose method improve visualization endoscopic sinus surgery ( ESS ) , largely due physiologic decrease cardiac output without peripheral smooth muscle relaxation resultant vasodilation associate inhaled anesthetic . This may especially important case advance inflammatory sinus disease , visualization may compromise . The goal study improve clinical practice paradigm evaluate use TIVA versus inhale anesthetic maintenance anesthesia ESS advance paranasal sinus disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific Aims : 1 . Determine effect total intravenous versus inhale anesthesia intraoperative visual field endoscopic sinus surgery advance paranasal sinus disease 2 . Evaluate clinical outcome associate choice total intravenous versus inhale anesthesia endoscopic sinus surgery General Design : Double blind , randomize control trial total intravenous versus inhale anesthetic maintenance anesthesia endoscopic sinus surgery . Subject Recruitment Screening : Patients screen study inclusion principal investigator ( EDM ) preoperative visit Department Otolaryngology . Those meeting inclusion criterion introduce study time . A full description research purpose , personnel , procedure , risk benefit present , copy study consent documentation provide home review . Method Assigning Subjects Treatment Groups : On day surgery , eligible participant admit Day Surgery Department , member Anesthesia team review study information confirm inform consent . A randomly assign , seal envelope open assign participant either TIVA , inhale anesthetic cohort . At time patient surgeon make aware patient 's cohort . Blinding Study Drug : At time patient surgeon make aware patient 's cohort . During procedure surgeon blind type anesthesia placement high drape head operative table . Study reviewer blind treatment arm without cohort assignment time review determination visual field score . Study Procedures : Participants make clinic/hospital visit purpose study completion patient interaction limit visit survey complete part routine clinical care . Clinic visit include baseline preoperative visit , visit 1 week , 4 week , 10 week surgery .</detailed_description>
