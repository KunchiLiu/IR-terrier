	<brief_summary>No study investigate dietary composition carbohydrate influence glycaemic effect single multiple bolus subcutaneous low-dose glucagon . Further , recommend diet composition patient type 1 diabetes thoroughly validate . Many patient type 1 diabetes practice low carbohydrate eating pattern due assumption diet reduce fluctuation plasma glucose . Before glucagon use add-on intensive insulin treatment , aspect need elucidate . The purpose study determine , whether diet composition carbohydrate affect glycogen store liver affect glucose response glucagon hypoglycaemia . HYPOTHESIS : In patient type 1 diabetes , glucose response single bolus low-dose glucagon associate diet carbohydrate content . AIM : The aim investigate one week high- compare low-carbohydrate diet influence glycaemic response low-dose glucagon patient insulin pump treat type 1 diabetes . The secondary aim investigate two dietary intervention week differ incidence hypoglycaemia , postprandial hyperglycaemia , daily glucose excursion . DESIGN : A non-blinded two-way cross-over , randomize study conduct . After participant give informed consent , go four step : 1 ) screen visit 2 ) Run-in period , 3 ) first meal intervention one week finalize one study visit 4 ) second meal intervention one week finalize another study visit .</brief_summary>
