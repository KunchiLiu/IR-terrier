	<criteria>Pathologically cytologically confirm pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma . Patients pathology cytology show carcinoma pancreas adenosquamous pancreas also eligible . Locally advanced pancreatic cancer , include patient define Callery19 `` unresectable '' `` borderline resectable '' eligible : Measurable disease per RECIST 1.1 No prior chemotherapy pancreatic cancer . No major surgery within 3 week start study treatment . Patients must recover side effect major surgery start study treatment . For question surgery deem `` major , '' definition surgeon use clarification . Laparoscopy central venous catheter placement consider major surgery . No prior invasive malignancy within prior two year . However , patient early stage malignancy expect require treatment next 2 year ( early stage , resect breast cancer asymptomatic prostate cancer ) eligible . ECOG performance status 0 1 . Age ≥ 18 Not pregnant nursing . Women child bear potential must negative serum urine pregnancy test ( minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L equivalent unit HCG ) within 7 day prior begin treatment . Postmenopausal woman ( surgical menopause lack menses &gt; 24 month ) need pregnancy test , please document status . Women childbearing potential sexually active male must use effective contraception method 28 day prior treatment , treatment three month complete treatment ( men use contraception six month post last dose drug ) . Documentation discuss require . Required Initial Laboratory Values : Neutrophils ≥ 1,500/mm3 Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3 ( transfusion independent , define receive platelet transfusion within 7 day prior laboratory sample ) Hemoglobin &gt; 9.0g/dL Creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min Total bilirubin &lt; 1 . 5 x ULN AST ( SGOT ) &amp; ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 x ULN Alkaline phosphatase &lt; 2.5xULN . ( Patients elevate alkaline phosphatase , total bilirubin , AST ALT , subsequently undergone biliary stenting liver test improve , need wait alkaline phosphatase become &lt; 2.5x ULN total bilirubin , AST ALT improve within require study level alkaline phosphatase decreasing . ) Patients metastatic disease Prior hypersensitivity Oxaliplatin Abraxane ® investigator opinion would put patient risk reexposed Preexisting neuropathy allow cause . Patients serious medical risk factor involve major organ system investigator considers unsafe patient receive FOLFOXA Patients unstable biliary stent plastic stent . Information type stent require registration . Patients active infection fever ( patient antibiotic infection patient get cold seasonal virus exclude ) , know historical active infection HIV , hepatitis B , hepatitis C. Patients active sepsis pneumonitis . Patients history interstitial lung disease , history slowly progressive dyspnea unproductive cough , sarcoidosis , silicosis , idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis , pulmonary hypersensitivity pneumonitis multiple allergy investigator 's opinion would put patient increase risk . Uncontrolled diabetes . If patient diabetes , confirmation status ( control uncontrolled ) require registration .</criteria>
