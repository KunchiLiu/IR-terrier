	<detailed_description>With healthcare spending accounting almost one-fifth U.S. economy even large share public sector budget , substantial interest innovation healthcare delivery reduce `` use '' resource low value patient . As result , key need rigorous evidence scalable intervention aim improving efficiency U.S. healthcare sector general , public sector particular , account $ 1.25 trillion annual healthcare spending ( Centers Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services , 2013 ) . In particular , widespread concern medical profession ( Callaghan et al. , 2014 ; Sherman , 2012 ) public sector ( U.S. Government Accountability Office , 2008 ) cost health risk `` over-scanning '' . Estimates suggest many 30 % image U.S. unnecessary ( Consumer Reports , 2015 ; Dehn et al. , 2000 ; Georgiou et al. , 2011 ) . Medicare direct spending `` high-cost '' scan ( e.g . MRs CTs ) $ 10 billion 2012 , 2 % total Medicare cost ( Medicare Payment Advisory Commission , 2014 ) ; indirect cost likely considerably great , since image often trigger additional follow care ( Sherman , 2012 ; Shreibati Baker , 2011 ) . It also estimate 2 percent cancer U.S. due CT use ( Brenner Hall , 2007 ) . Reflecting concern , start 2017 Medicare longer reimburse high-cost scan unless order use `` acceptable '' Clinical Decision Support ( CDS ) system ( Pitts , 2014 ) . Despite upcoming policy change , know large-scale randomized trial impact CDS imaging . The intervention study provide Clinical Decision Support ( CDS ) target high-cost radiology order , MR CT scan , healthcare provider treat patient outpatient setting affiliate Mount Sinai Hospital Mount Sinai Queens hospital New York City . CDS tool embed order entry system provide information guidance provider whether intend order `` appropriate '' whether highly recommended alternative . The randomization provider level : one group receive CDS , remain provider serve control group . The CDS deliver order-entry software , Epic , ACRSelect software , lead decision support tool base American College Radiology ( ACR ) Appropriateness Criteria . Recommendations appear CDS tool computerized version guideline create American College Radiology ( ACR ) . The guideline score appropriateness scan order give health indication , indication include common symptom diagnosis keywords , `` acute headache . '' In particular , indication-scan pair assign `` appropriateness rating '' 1-9 . Scores 1-3 'usually appropriate , ' 4-6 'may appropriate , ' 7-9 'usually appropriate . '</detailed_description>
