	<brief_title>An Intervention Study Assess Effect Mediterranean Diet Plasma Fatty Acid Profile</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Geographical difference incidence CardioVascular Disease ( CVD ) show low risk country south Europe compare north east Europe USA . The Mediterranean Diet ( MD ) frequently invoke factor explain difference , underlie mechanism still unclear . On hand , blood fatty acid ( FA ) composition show strongly relate cardiovascular risk , presumably change oxidative stress inflammatory pathway , two mechanism involve pathogenesis atherothrombosis . Preliminary data group suggest patient Coronary Heart Disease ( CHD ) adhere less feature MD exhibit different fatty acid profile compare healthy subject . We speculate MD may reduce oxidative stress inflammatory marker , reverse unfavorable blood fatty acid profile observe patient CHD . Even though single MD component ( wine , olive oil , vegetable , fish , etc ) show beneficial effect oxidative stress , inflammation CardioVascular ( CV ) risk , evidence indicates effect mostly relate extent compliance whole MD , comprise possible synergism food component . For reason , present study consider whole MD single component . Design : randomize , parallel group , open-label , intervention trial . Intervention : intensively advise MD ( fatty fish least 3 times/week ; legume 2-3 times/ week ; vegetable twice day ; fruit twice/day ; 30-45g olive oil/day ; 1-2 glass red wine/day , 150g red meat/week ) , personalize term calorie , total lipid balance term saturate , mono- poly-unsaturated lipid ( n= 75 ) vs. usual low-fat dietary advice ( n=75 ) 3 month . Participants : male female , age 30-75 , recent history coronary revascularization , randomize clinical stabilization ( least 60 day coronary procedure event ) . At baseline intervention group : Dietary assessment : use EPIC questionnaire , well validated dietary recall tool . Blood , urinary fecal sample : routine biochemical determination , blood fatty acid composition gas-chromatography , C reactive protein oxidative stress marker ( urinary isoprostanes , whole blood reduce oxidized glutathione Liquid Chromatography- Mass Spectrometry ( LC-MS/MS ) , plasma alpha- gamma-tocopherol High Performance Liquid Chromatography ( HPLC ) fluorimetric detector ) , gene expression and/or epigenome peripheral whole blood cell ( index global change inflammation/immune response ) , intestinal microbiome . Statistical analysis : Principal component analysis characterize fatty acid pattern . Score Trichopoulou ass adherence MD .</detailed_description>
