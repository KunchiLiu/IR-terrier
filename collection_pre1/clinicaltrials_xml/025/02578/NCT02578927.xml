	<brief_summary>The objective investigate whether ingestion green tea prior physical exercise improvement post-exercise hypotension ( PEH ) . Double-blind , randomize , placebo study . Fifteen hypertensive ( 53±4.5 year ) perform three procedure : green tea+exercise ( GT+Ex ) , placebo+exercise ( PL+Ex ) , green tea without exercise ( GT ) . Thirty minute ingest 2g green tea placebo , perform treadmill walking ( 60 minute ) , 60 85 % maximum heart rate intensity procedures exercise . BP measure rest every 10 minute exercise ( 60 minute ) . Blood sample take ingestion green tea placebo immediately exercise determine Malondialdehyde ( MDA ) Nitrite ( NO ) dosages . Reduction systolic BP compare rest , PL+Ex recovery procedure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subjects study : Double- blind study , randomize placebo , conduce fifteen sex hypertensive individual , physically active practitioner exercise least 3 month prior trial . All patient user anti- hypertensive medication except beta- blocker maintain medication throughout study period . They demand diabetic woman menopaused . The research approve Ethics Committee Research Human Beings Health Sciences Centre Federal University Paraiba- CEP/ CCS , protocol 0120/13 . Individuals require sign The Free Clarified Consent Term ( FCCT ) , accord resolution 196/96 National Health Council . Study Designs : subject perform three experimental procedure , two practice aerobic exercise one without physical exercise . The session exercise conduct previous administration green tea dosage placebo ( GT+Ex PL+Ex ) , ingest 30 minute start exercise protocol . In session without exercise ( GT ) ingest green tea remain sit period destine exercise . Heart Rate Measurement register rest ( RHR ) every ten minute physical exercise protocol . BP measurement take ( rest ) , immediately exercise every ten minute recovery period 60 minute end exercise protocol , period remain sit . Blood sample collect prior immediately exercise period without exercise analysis plasmatic concentration anti pro- oxidant agent ( nitrite- NO Malondialdehyde- MDA ) . Instruments Procedures : Physical Exercises : After purpose research clarify individual , invite proceed laboratory order exercise session performance . The group submit three session , two treadmill aerobic exercise 60 minute . Furthermore , establish individual practice exercise score 11 14 Borg Noble 's Subjective Perceived Exertion Scale . They request hold intensity physical exercise 60 % 85 % HRmax ( maximum Heart Rate ) , monitor session Polar frequency meter model RS800CX ( Polar ElectroOy , Kempele , Finland ) . Supplementation Green Tea Placebo : Green tea placebo capsule produce compound laboratory . The investigator use 2g green tea dry leaf discover improvement oxidative stress . The group green tea consumption ingest capsule 2g concentrated powder , approximately 1960mg polyphenols ( 636mg epigallocatechin gallate ) 20mg caffeine ; placebo group consume capsule contain 2g cornstarch powder , swallow water . Capsules administer patient skilled professional collect blood sample . Researchers conduct supplementation substance pre- exercise blood collection session initiate 30 minute ingestion capsule , time require body absorb nutrient . Blood Pressure Measurement : Individuals BPs check previously , immediately end exercise 60 minute post- exercise . BP rest verify subject remain sit 10 minute . By end walking session , BP check sit subject . During recovery , BP verify every 10 minute 60 minute walk session . The protocol adopt one propose Brazilian Society Cardiology Brazilian Society Hypertension . Blood Collection Protocol : Performed prior immediately exercise . Ten milliliter ( ml ) blood collect antecubital vein , five ml place test tube contain EDTA carefully homogenize inversion . The five ml place tube without anticoagulant . Then centrifuge 1500 rpm 20 minute . Plasma isolate , place ependorf tube refrigerate 20 ºC analysis . Evaluation oxidative stress ( MDA ) : Oxidizing activity quantify thiobarbituric acid reaction product hydroperoxides decomposition . Therefore , 250 µl sample add KCl incubated water bath maintain 37° C 60 minute . Then mixture precipitate 35 % AA perchloric centrifuge 14000 rpm 4°C 10 minute . Supernatant transfer new ependorfs , add 400 µl 0.6 % thiobarbituric acid incubate 95-100° C 30 min . After cool , material read spectrophotometer wavelength 532nm . Nitrite Dosage The method base Griess reagent usage . Reagent prepare utilizing equal part 5 % phosphoric acid , 0.1 % N-1-naphthalenediamine ( NEED ) , 1 % sulphanilamide , 5 % phosphoric acid distil water . To accomplish test , 100 µl 10 % homogenate supernatant make potassium phosphate buffer add 100µl Griess reagent . Regarding white one , 100 µl reagent add 100 µl buffer series dilution conduct obtain standard curve ( 100 , 50 , 25 12.5 , 6.25 , 3.12 , 1.56 µm ) nitrite . The entire test execute 96 well- plate template reader absorbance range 560 nm . Data Analysis Process : Initially , data test concerned normality variability standard error . Subsequently , one-way ANOVA test apply order compare basal condition within three day proceeding . Instat 3.0 software ( GraphPAdInstat , San Diego , CA , USA ) utilize analysis .</detailed_description>
