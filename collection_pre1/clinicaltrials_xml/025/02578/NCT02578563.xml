	<brief_summary>To evaluate clinical effectiveness safety Singaporean Type 2 Diabetes mellitus patient administer SGLT 2 inhibitor monotherapy combination commonly use hypoglycaemic drug real life clinical setting . To evaluate real life clinical effectiveness safety Sodium-Glucose Co-Transporter inhibitor- 2 Singaporean Type 2 diabetes mellitus patient treat outpatient basis clinical practice set . The study would also assess treatment pattern SGLT2 inhibitor patient relevant outcome whole population well pre identify patient subgroup . Primary analysis do 1 year extend analysis 2 year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>T2DM associate overweight/obesity high fasting plasma glucose ( FPG ) White patient , whereas Asian patient predispose high abdominal fat distribution high postprandial glucose ( PPG ) level , think contribute1-4 . In response identical meal , Asian subject exhibit great glycemic response White subjects4,5 . According Diabetic Society Singapore , one nine people age 18 69 diabetes , 's 11.3 % population 400,000 people &amp; expect rise increase prevalence sedentary lifestyle high-calorie dietary intake . SGLT2 inhibitor offer novel insulin-independent approach lower hyperglycaemia improve metabolic control type 2 diabetes : reduce renal glucose reabsorption inhibition SGLT2 transporter proximal tubule kidney , result urinary glucose excretion . Since SGLT2 inhibition independent Î²-cell function insulin sensitivity , treatment approach could applications throughout natural history diabetes.6 The reduction fast plasma glucose concentration bodyweight treatment SGLT2 , sustain . Early weight loss , partly due mild osmotic diuresis cause SGLT2 I , however , gradual progressive reduction bodyweight thereafter , decrease waist circumference , consistent reduction fat mass . This reduction potentially attributable loss excess energy glucose excretion urine , effect support increased urinary glucose/creatinine ratio patient assign SGLT2i.6 Many trial show SGLT2 improve glycaemic control patient inadequate control metformin . The drug act independently insulin , lower weight , associate risk hypoglycaemia . Safety tolerability drug also confirm . Therefore , addition SGLT2i metformin provide new therapeutic option treatment type 2 diabetes.6 Data collection do AZ medical personnel Pharmacy intern , paper data collection hand CRO company data entry &amp; analysis..Data analysis do independent CRO company namely BioQuest Solutions .</detailed_description>
