	<detailed_description>Given follow key point evidence , optimal management chest pain patient come diagnostic coronary angiography would often achieve concomitant data regard presence patient-specific lesion-specific ischaemia : - presence extent reversible myocardial ischaemia ( RMI ) dominate coronary anatomy predictor near term cardiovascular event , well symptom relief - prognostic benefit revascularisation great patient large pre-procedure ischaemic burden - intra-coronary pressure wire ( PW ) data strongly correlate subsequent cardiac event despite binary nature test - stenting coronary lesion PW negative bad outcome optimal medical therapy ( OMT ) - PW-directed percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) multivessel disease associate well clinical outcome angiogram-directed PCI despite few treated lesion less stent - PW-directed PCI improve prognosis compare OMT - mismatch exist 30-40 % lesion encounter angiography visual appearance severity lesion whether lesion `` ischaemic '' ( therefore target revascularisation ) accord PW . The availability PW show substantial effect overall management patient undergo diagnostic coronary angiography ( ie option still OMT/PCI coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) several observation study include RIPCORD French Registry . Yet , despite seemingly persuasive data summarise , uptake PW diagnostic stage patient pathway still low . There , yet , suitably power randomised trial use PW systematically stage diagnostic angiography compare outcome management base upon angiography alone . This gap fill RIPCORD2 . RIPCORD2 use new Boston Scientific Pressure Wire ( BSPW ) , currently undergo first-in-man test Chile . The device , course , already internally validate Boston Scientific engineer scientist , purpose COMET study provide independent objective validation performance BSPW use performance St Jude Medical pressure wire ( SJPW ) reference , use inter-wire intra-wire measurement . Thus , assess reproducibility measurement 2 wire , investigator also compare reproducibility measurement 2 wire manufacturer .</detailed_description>
