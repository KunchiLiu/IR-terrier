	<brief_summary>This efficacy safety study pembrolizumab ( MK-3475 ) combine platinum-pemetrexed chemotherapy versus platinum-pemetrexed chemotherapy alone participant advance metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) previously receive systemic therapy advance disease . Participants randomly assign receive pembrolizumab combine pemetrexed platinum ( Investigators choice cisplatin carboplatin ) , OR pemetrexed platinum ( Investigators choice cisplatin carboplatin ) . The primary hypothesis pembrolizumab combination platinum-pemetrexed chemotherapy prolongs Progression Free Survival ( PFS ) compare platinum-pemetrexed chemotherapy alone .</brief_summary>
