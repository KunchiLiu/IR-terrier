	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) gadoxetate disodium measuring tumor patient liver cancer . Diagnostic procedure , MRI gadoxetate disodium , may help find diagnose liver cancer find far disease spread . It yet know whether MRI gadoxetate disodium provide precise measurement liver tumor standard compute tomography ( CT ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MRI With Gadoxetate Disodium Measuring Tumors Patients With Liver Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate precision gadoxetate ( gadoxetate disodium ) -enhanced MRI evaluate lesion size . II . To evaluate subjective improvement delineation hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) hepatocellular phase contrast administration . III . To assess sensitivity gadoxetate-enhanced MRI detection HCC . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate reproducibility various tumor measurement technique evaluation HCC . II . To evaluate administration gadoxetate affect diffusion weight image . OUTLINE : Patients receive gadoxetate disodium intravenously ( IV ) undergo enhance liver MRI . After completion study , patient follow 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 month .</detailed_description>
