	<brief_summary>The study aim provide complete characterization understand genetic cause tumor DNA detection potential colorectal cancer . Ultimately findings study use develop early detection test colorectal cancer minimally invasive ( base blood test ) . It hop reliable , minimally invasive , early detection method lead improve screening rate , increase screen safety , long colorectal cancer survival , overall cost saving . In order assess test 's ability detect tumor DNA , 25 participant know colorectal cancer undergo surgical resection colon part clinical care recruit . The investigator collect blood participant prior surgery , tumor normal tissue remove surgery , series blood sample surgery one year relevant medical record . DNA variant identify blood compare tissue sample . Serial sample analyze assess variance amount circulate tumor DNA across time standard treatment .</brief_summary>
