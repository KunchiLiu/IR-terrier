	<criteria>1 . Male female , age 18 65 year , inclusive 2 . Diagnosis XLH support classic clinical feature adult XLH ( short stature bow leg ) , least ONE follow Screening : Documented PHEX mutation either patient directly relate family member appropriate Xlinked inheritance Serum intact FGF23 ( iFGF23 ) level &gt; 30 pg/mL Kainos assay 3 . Biochemical finding consistent XLH base overnight fasting ( min . 8 hour ) : Serum phosphorus &lt; 2.5 mg/dL Screening TmP/GFR &lt; 2.5 mg/dL Screening 4 . Presence skeletal pain attribute XLH/osteomalacia , define score ≥ 4 Brief Pain Inventory question 3 ( BPIQ3 , Worst Pain ) Screening . ( Skeletal pain , opinion investigator , attribute solely cause XLH/osteomalacia—for example , back pain joint pain presence severe osteoarthritis radiograph anatomical location—in absence skeletal pain likely attribute XLH/osteomalacia consider eligibility ) 5 . Estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) ≥ 60 mL/min ( use Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration [ CKDEPI ] equation ) eGFR 45 &lt; 60 mL/min Screening confirmation renal insufficiency due nephrocalcinosis 6 . Provide write informed consent nature study explain , prior researchrelated procedure . If subject minor , provide write assent legally authorize representative willing able provide write informed consent , nature study explain , prior researchrelated procedure 7 . Willing provide access prior medical record collection biochemical radiographic data disease history 8 . Females childbearing potential must negative urine pregnancy test Screening willing additional pregnancy test study . Females consider childbearing potential include menopause least two year prior Screening , tubal ligation least one year prior Screening , total hysterectomy bilateral salpingooophorectomy . 9 . Participants child‐bearing potential partner childbearing potential undergone total hysterectomy bilateral salpingo‐oophorectomy sexually active must consent use two effective method contraception determine site investigator ( i.e . oral hormonal contraceptive , patch hormonal contraceptive , vaginal ring , intrauterine device , physical doublebarrier method , surgical hysterectomy , vasectomy , tubal ligation , true abstinence ) period follow signing informed consent 12 week last dose study drug 10 . Must , opinion investigator , willing able complete aspect study , adhere study visit schedule comply assessments 1 . Use pharmacologic vitamin D metabolite analog ( e.g . calcitriol , doxercalciferol , paricalcitol ) within 2 year Screening 2 . Use oral phosphate within 2 year Screening 3 . Use aluminum hydroxide antacid , acetazolamides , thiazide within 7 day prior Screening 4 . Use bisphosphonates 2 year prior Screening 5 . Use denosumab 6 month prior Screening 6 . Use teriparatide 2 month prior Screening 7 . Chronic use systemic corticosteroid define 10 day 2 month prior Screening 8 . Corrected serum calcium level ≥ 10.8 mg/dL ( 2.7 mmol/L ) Screening 9 . Serum intact parathyroid hormone ( iPTH ) ≥ 2.5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) Screening 10 . Use medication suppress parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) ( cinacalcet example ) within 60 day prior Screening 11 . Prothrombin time/Partial thromboplastin time ( PT/PTT ) outside normal range Screening 12 . Evidence disease use anticoagulant medication ( warfarin , heparin , direct thrombin inhibitor , xabans , opinion investigator , discontinue ) may increase risk bleed biopsy procedure 13 . Pregnant breastfeed Screening plan become pregnant ( self partner ) time study 14 . Unable unwilling withhold prohibit medication throughout study 15 . Documented dependence narcotic 16 . Use KRN23 , therapeutic monoclonal antibody within 90 day prior Screening 17 . Use investigational product investigational medical device within 30 day prior Screening , requirement investigational agent prior completion schedule study assessment . OR , Japan , use investigational product investigational medical device within 4 month prior Screening , requirement investigational agent prior completion schedule study assessment . 18 . Presence history hypersensitivity , allergic anaphylactic reaction monoclonal antibody KRN23 excipients , judgment investigator , place subject increase risk adverse effect 19 . History allergic reaction adverse reaction tetracycline demeclocycline 20 . Prior history positive test human immunodeficiency virus antibody , hepatitis B surface antigen , and/or hepatitis C antibody 21 . History recurrent infection ( dental abscess , know associated XLH ) predisposition infection , know immunodeficiency 22 . Presence malignant neoplasm ( except basal cell carcinoma ) 23 . Presence concurrent disease condition would interfere study participation affect safety 24 . Presence history condition , view investigator , place subject high risk poor treatment compliance completing study</criteria>
