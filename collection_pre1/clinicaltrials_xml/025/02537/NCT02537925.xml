	<brief_title>The Effect COX-2 Inhibitor Radiosensitivity Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Study Patients : Patients recruit Third Affiliated Hospital Guangxi Medical University , Nanning , Guangxi , China . All patient provide write informed consent enrollment . All eligible patient receive pretreatment evaluation include complete history physical examination , endoscopic biopsy , routine laboratory test hematologic , renal hepatic function well dental nutritional evaluation prior treatment . Radiological investigation consist computed tomography ( CT ) scan magnetic MRI nasopharynx , chest radiography , ultrasound upper abdomen bone scintigraphy . Pathologic confirmation nasopharyngeal cancer ( NPC ) perform re-classified accord world health organization ( WHO ) subtypes . 2 . Study design : A total 120 NPC patient randomly equally divide two group : Nedaplatin alone concurrent radiotherapy , Celecoxib plus nedaplatin concurrent radiotherapy . The tumor response evaluate magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) 4 week . The tumor responses include Complete Response ( CR ) , Partial Response ( PR ) , Stable Disease ( SD ) Progressive Disease ( PD ) define accord Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) , version 1.0 . The show term long term toxicity evaluate accord National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria ( NCICTC ) , version 3.0 . All NPC patient request follow expect average every 3 month therapy.The clinical outcome include first evidence cancer progression death cause , occurrence distant metastasis , relapse local nodal tumor evaluate well . The follow-up 2018 . 3 . Statistical Analysis : Statistical Package Social Sciences ( SPSS 13.0 ) use analyze effect celecoxib nedaplatin concurrent radiotherapy . Cox 's regression model Kaplan-Meier method use conduct survival analysis . Clinical outcome include tumor response , 1-year/3-year/5-year overall survival ( OS ) , progression free survival ( PFS ) , distant metastasis failure-free survival ( DMFS ) locoregional failure-free survival ( LFFS ) analyze . The multivariate Cox 's regression model use adjust confounders , include age body mass index . P value le 0.05 consider statistically significant .</detailed_description>
