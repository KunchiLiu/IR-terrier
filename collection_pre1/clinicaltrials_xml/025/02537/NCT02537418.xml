	<brief_title>Durvalumab With Without Tremelimumab Advanced Incurable Solid Malignancies Given With Without Standard Chemotherapy Regimens</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The researcher study also interested look marker help predict patient likely help study drug , durvalumab tremelimumab . This do start dose low one cause side effect animal . Participants give durvalumab alone durvalumab together tremelimumab watch closely see side effect make sure side effect severe . If side effect severe , new participant give high dose durvalumab together tremelimumab . Participants join study later get high dos durvalumab together tremelimumab participant join earlier . This continue dose find cause severe temporary side effect . Doses high give . The second purpose see difference side effect way durvalumab tremelimumab handle body durvalumab give together time tremelimumab compare durvalumab give tremelimumab . This call dose level five .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must histologically and/or cytologically confirm cancer advance / metastatic / recurrent unresectable curative therapy exists . Patients must consider suitable candidate eligible receive one regimen ( include durvalumab tremelimumab alone ( dose level 5 ) include protocol open accrual . For regimen , specific criterion registration may applicable cohort/dose level ensure tolerability plan phase II III trial . Centres must confirm plan cohort open accrual whether restriction tumour type prior approach patient . For etoposide/carboplatin regimen , patient must untreated small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) . If formalin fix paraffin embed tissue block ( primary metastatic tumour ) available , patient must provide informed consent release block . All patient must provide informed consent correlative study . Presence clinically and/or radiologically documented disease . All radiology study must perform within 28 day prior registration ( within 35 day negative ) . Patients ideally measurable disease . Patients must ECOG performance status 0 , 1 , 2 ( 0 1 untreated SCLC enrol etoposide/carboplatin ) . Patients PS 2 must consider fit first line cytotoxic immune base therapy discuss CCTG prior enrolment . Previous Therapy • Cytotoxic Chemotherapy : All Cohorts Except EtoposideCarboplatin : • Patients receive prior chemotherapy advance disease . Exceptions may make select patient regimen . Patients plan dose level 5 may receive one line prior chemotherapy . Consult CCTG approach patient . Notes : Patients plan cisplatin regimen receive 250mg mg/m2 prior cisplatin . EtoposideCarboplatin Cohort : • For dose level 03 , patient untreated SCLC must receive two cycle first etoposide carboplatin regimen prior registration chemotherapy cohort . For dose level 4 , SCLC patient plan etoposide/carboplatin cohort may prior chemotherapy regimen first two cycle etoposideplatinum prior study entry . Other Systemic Therapy : Patients may receive prior therapy include immunotherapy , angiogenesis inhibitor , PARP inhibitor signal transduction inhibitor . Patients receive treatment PDL1 / PD1 , CTLA4 antibodies must intolerable toxicity require steroid manage toxicity . Patients must recover reversible toxicity relate prior chemotherapy systemic therapy adequate washout follow : Longest one follow : Two week 5 half life investigational agent Standard cycle length standard therapy Radiation : • Prior external beam radiation permit provide minimum 28 day ( 4 week ) elapse last dose radiation date registration . Exceptions may make lowdose , nonmyelosuppressive radiotherapy consultation CCTG . Concurrent radiotherapy permit . Patients plan concurrent chemotherapyradiation eligible . Patients curative dos radiation marrowbearing area may eligible . Consult CCTG . Surgery : • Previous surgery permit provide minimum 28 day ( 4 week ) elapse major surgery date registration , wound heal occur . Patients must recover treatment related toxicity prior registration ( unless grade 1 , irreversible , consider investigator clinically significant ) . Hematology : Absolute neutrophils ≥ 1.5 x 10^9/L Platelets ≥ 100 x 10^9/L Hemoglobin ≥ 90 g/L Chemistry : Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN ( upper limit normal ) * If confirm Gilbert 's , eligible provide ≤ 3 x UNL ; AST ALT ≤ 2.5 x ULN ( liver metastasis present , ≤5 x UNL ) Serum creatinine &lt; 1.25 x ULN : Creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min Patient consent must appropriately obtain accordance applicable local regulatory requirement . Each patient must sign consent form prior registration trial prior test consider study specific document willingness participate . Patients give inform consent ( i.e . mentally incompetent patient , physically incapacitate comatose patient ) recruit study . Patients competent physically unable sign consent form may document sign nearest relative legal guardian . Each patient provide full explanation study consent request . Female patient childbearing potential sexually active non sterilize male partner must use least one highly effective method contraception study 6 month last dose durvalumab tremelimumab 3 month last dose durvalumab alone consult product monograph standard chemotherapy . Male partner female subject nonsterilized male patient sexually active female partner childbearing potential must use male condom plus spermicide study 6 month last dose durvalumab tremelimumab 3 month last dose durvalumab alone consult product monograph standard chemotherapy . Female partner male subject must use highly effective method contraception throughout period . Cessation birth control point discuss responsible physician . Male patient also refrain donate sperm . Patients must accessible treatment follow . Patients register trial must treat follow participate centre . This imply must reasonable geographical limit ( example : 1 ½ hour 's driving distance ) place patient consider trial . Investigators must assure patient registered trial available complete documentation treatment , response assessment , adverse event , followup . In accordance CCTG policy , protocol treatment begin within 2 work day patient registration Patients history malignancy require concurrent anticancer therapy . Active prior document autoimmune inflammatory disorder ( include inflammatory bowel disease ( e.g . colitis Crohn 's disease ) , diverticulitis exception diverticulosis , celiac disease serious gastrointestinal chronic condition associate diarrhea ) , systemic lupus erythematosus , Sarcoidosis syndrome , Wegener syndrome ( granulomatosis polyangiitis ) , rheumatoid arthritis , hypophysitis , uveitis , etc. , within past 3 year prior start treatment . The following exception criterion : Patients alopecia . Patients Grave 's disease , vitiligo psoriasis require systemic treatment ( within last 2 year ) . Patients hypothyroidism ( e.g . follow Hashimoto syndrome ) stable hormone replacement . History primary immunodeficiency , history allogenic organ transplant require therapeutic immunosuppression use immunosuppressive agent within 28 day registration* prior history severe ( grade 3 4 ) immune mediate toxicity immune therapy grade ≥ 3 infusion reaction . * NOTE : Intranasal/inhaled corticosteroid systemic steroid exceed 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent dose alternative corticosteroid permissible . Live attenuate vaccination administer within 30 day prior registration . History hypersensitivity durvalumab tremelimumab excipient . Patients receive treatment PDL1 / PD1 , CTLA4 antibodies must intolerable toxicity require steroid manage toxicity . Mean QT interval correct heart rate use Fridericia 's formula ( QTcF ) ≥ 470 msec screen ECG measure use standard institutional method history familial long QT syndrome . Patients experience untreated and/or uncontrolled cardiovascular condition and/or symptomatic cardiac dysfunction ( unstable angina , congestive heart failure , myocardial infarction within previous year cardiac ventricular arrhythmia require medication , history 2nd 3rd degree atrioventricular conduction defect ) .
