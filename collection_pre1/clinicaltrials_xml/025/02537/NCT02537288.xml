	<brief_title>A Study Healthy Volunteers Assess Effect Fedovapagon QT/QTC Interval</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Regulatory guidance ( ICH E14 ) emphasize need obtain clear robust data effect new chemical entity ECG parameter focus cardiac repolarization measure QTc duration . Though many Phase 1 , 2 3 trial may conduct usually insufficient sample size , infrequent sample ECG data , use inadequate control overcome high rate spontaneous change QTc duration . This result regulatory guidance recommend dedicate thorough trial define ECG effect new drug . This study conduct healthy volunteer eliminate variable know effect ECG parameter ( concomitant drug , disease , etc. ) . A supra-therapeutic dose fedovapagon require mimic exposure healthy volunteer may occur target population bad circumstance ( e.g. , concomitant use CYP3A4 inhibitor , concomitant liver disease , presence heart disease , take clinical dose prescribe , etc . ) allow PK QTc model assess effect drug concentration cardiac repolarization . A cross-over trial prefer design subject act control since accumulation clinical relevance plasma concentration parent dissipate 24 hour , single dose trial employ . During course study subject administer fedovapagon clinical supra-therapeutic dose , placebo moxifloxacin ( positive control ) . The sample size driven need time-matched statistical analysis primary endpoint per ICH E14 guidance .</detailed_description>
