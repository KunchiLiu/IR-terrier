	<brief_summary>This phase 1 study ( first step test new drug combination , see safe drug and/or combination ) investigational agent BYL719 patient locally advanced head neck cancer ( LA-SCCHN ) combination standard radiation chemotherapy ( cisplatin ) . BYL719 new drug able bind ( attach ) block protein call PI3K-alpha . PI3K-alpha part important pathway call EGFR/PI3K/Akt . A pathway series chemical reaction among protein cell involved support normal cellular function . If pathway active , due change protein , pathway lead tumor cell growth , survival invasion . BYL719 show stop cancer laboratory animal study . This study first time BYL719 combine radiation chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Study BYL719 Combination With Cisplatin Radiotherapy Patients With Squamous Cell Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants screen eligibility within 30 day intend start study treatment . Procedures research purpose do screen include archival tumor tissue collection pharmacodynamic predictive biomarker research optional HPV status ( already know ) . Eligible participant take BYL719 , mouth , day , start one week prior start radiation chemotherapy , 8 week . The start dose BYL719 200 mg . Participants ask record dos study drug diary . Participants also receive radiation therapy every day Monday Friday 7 week . Chemotherapy ( cisplatin ) give intravenously Monday week 1 , 4 , 7 ( 48 hour window week 4 7 ) .
