	<brief_title>Central Peripheral Blood Pressure Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stroke lead cause death worldwide , prominent cause chronic disability , cause significant physical , cognitive social impairment . In United Kingdom , 150,000 stroke year , ~900,000 people live debilitate effect stroke.Individuals experience stroke transient ischaemic attack ( TIAÍ¾ minor stroke ) heighten risk experience vascular event future , myocardial infarction , stroke secondary TIAs , death . Of measure interest , great blood pressure control important contributor positive health outcome stroke patient . However , clinical practice , research date concentrate assessment peripheral blood pressure assessment ( blood pressure identify arm ) . The measurement central haemodynamic parameter , include central systolic blood pressure ( cSBP ) arterial wave reflection ( i.e. , augmentation index , AIx ) , hold potential provide clinician important diagnostic prognostic information beyond provide traditional peripheral blood pressure reading . The assessment central blood pressure important reflect stress load left ventricle coronary artery . Considering marked difference pulse pressure central aorta peripheral limb , peripheral blood pressure may accurately reflect effect peak arterial blood pressure centrally locate organ . Previous research demonstrate central blood pressure 50 % superior peripheral blood pressure predict cardiovascular event , comparison peripheral blood pressure , central blood pressure may improve management hypertension . Owing recent technological advance , central haemodynamic parameter obtain quickly noninvasively use automate blood pressure cuff ( oscillometer ) .While validity device measure central haemodynamic parameter demonstrate , study require determine measurement precision ( reliability ) normal clinical operating condition ( i.e . , hospital general practioner set ) . As , study assess influence fasting status ( fast vs. nonfasted ) posture ( seat vs. supine ) central peripheral blood pressure measure patient diagnose stroke . The study determine whether parameter reliably assess whether stroke severity ( major stroke , minor stroke , TIA ) influence report result . Design setting : This study single centre observational study . All stroke/TIA patient recruit Royal Hampshire County Hospital within Hampshire Hospital NHS Foundation Trust ( HHFT ) . Patients recruit inpatient outpatient setting . For patient diagnosed major minor stroke discharge hospital , recruitment take place acute stroke ward hospital . For patient , assessment also undertake within hospital patient base acute stroke ward . For patient identify minor stroke TIA within emergency department outpatient setting ( i.e. , stroke clinic ) , stay acute stroke ward , recruit setting . All assessments patient take place Physiology Laboratory University Winchester . Written inform consent obtain participant . All stroke ( minor major ) patient assess use National Institute Health Stroke Severity Scale ( NIHSS ) . All patient suspect TIA assess ABCD2 . Participants comply pharmacological treatment recommend . Participants take part three separate assessment session , three separate day , minimum 24 hour recovery session . Before assessment participant undertake overnight fast ( water allow consume prior assessment ) . Participants take medication morning assessment accordance normal pharmacological management procedure use acute stroke ward Royal Hampshire County Hospital . Following , participant rest supine minimum 15 minute . Oscillometric pressure waveform ( use SphygmoCor XCEL ) , record leave upper arm , assess haemodynamic parameter include central peripheral blood pressure , pulse pressure , augmentation index . Two measurement take three-minute interval . If peripheral blood pressure &gt; 5 mmHg augmentation index &gt; 4 % , third measure take . Following , participant move seated position remain rested 15 minute . Identical procedure outline used assess central peripheral blood pressure response . Thereafter , patient consume normal breakfast . However , caffeine consume time . Thirty-minutes food consumption participant undertake identical procedure outline non-fasted-supine non-fasted-seated condition . Identical procedure outline first assessment session use assess central peripheral blood pressure measure second third assessment day . Oscillometric pressure waveform record left upper arm use SphygmoCor XCEL device assessment , follow standard manufacturer guideline . Each measurement cycle last approximately 60 sec , consist brachial blood pressure record 10 sec sub-systolic recording . A corresponding aortic pressure waveform generate use validate transfer function , central systolic , diastolic , pulse pressure ( cSBP , cDBP , cPP ) , augmentation pressure ( AP ) , augmentation index ( AIx ) derive . The AP define cSBP minus pressure inflection point , whereby inflection point merge forward reflect wave . The AIx define AP express percentage cPP . AIx influence heart rate , thus index correct heart rate 75 beat per minute ( AIx @ 75 ) also calculate . Central peripheral blood pressure assess follow four condition three assessment session : ) fast , supine , ii ) fast , seat , iii ) non-fasted supine , iv ) non-fasted seat . During condition two measurement take , separate three-minute interval . If blood pressure differ &gt; 5mmHG third record take close recording average . Each condition undertake follow minimum 15 minute quite rest .</detailed_description>
