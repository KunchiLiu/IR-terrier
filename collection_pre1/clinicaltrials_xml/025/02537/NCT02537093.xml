The present study aim demonstrate feasibility collect pilot data SNFs . This study fund University California ( UC Davis ) Behavior Health Center Excellence grant via California Mental Health Services Act ( Prop 63 ) . In large , future study , intend demonstrate ATP different STP clinical outcome accessible cost effective . Aim 1 : To assess whether ATP STP model improve clinical outcome : Hypotheses : Compared STP , ATP arm : H1 : show similar clinical outcome trajectory , reflect improvement baseline , measure Clinical Global Impression ( CGI ) , Patient Health Questionaire-9 ( PHQ-9 ) , Brief Interview Mental Status ( BIMS ) , overall behavioral symptom ; H2 : similar use health care resource : psychiatric medication , additional interval psychiatric visit , number emergency room visit hospitalization ( medical , psychiatric , overall ) ; And H3 : produce short wait time psychiatric consultation . Aim 2 : To assess acceptability ATP STP examine satisfaction survey SNF resident ( able complete survey ) . Hypothesis : Compared STP , ATP participants show : H1 : Similar level satisfaction measure : Telemedicine Satisfaction Survey complete participant . Aim 3 : To conduct preliminary healthcare economics analysis feasibility produce estimate cost-effectiveness ATP vs. STP SNFs . Hypotheses : ATP , compare STP , : H1 : cost effective measure cost saving reduce need face-to-face psychiatrist time similar use medical psychiatric service .</detailed_description>
