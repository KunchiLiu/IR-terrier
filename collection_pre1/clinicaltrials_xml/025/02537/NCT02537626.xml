	<brief_title>An Evaluation Effects Low Level Laser Light Therapy Improving Symptoms Alzheimer 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) progressive type dementia cause problem memory , think behavior gradually worsen time . With age population , AD escalating problem , currently affect estimate 35 million people worldwide , number expect grow 65 million 2030 115 million 2050 . It sixth lead cause death United States . AD fatal degenerative disease brain cause brain cell die result cause memory failure , personality change , problem carry daily activity symptom associate AD . AD think cause excess beta amyloid ( β-amyloid ) , sticky protein brain form amyloid plaque tangle accumulate time , associate significant loss neuron synaptic activity brain . Patients AD typically first present impaired memory language dysfunction , visuospatial dysfunction , impaired ability calculation complex task , behavioral and/or psychiatric symptom develop disease progress . The common sign symptom AD disease progress : memory loss disrupts daily life , challenge plan solve problem , difficulty complete familiar home , work leisure task , confusion time place , difficulty understand visual image spatial relationship , new problem word speak writing , misplace thing lose ability retrace step , decrease poor judgment , withdrawal work social activity , change mood , personality behavior . There presently cure Alzheimer 's disease progression . Current available treatment help lessen stabilize symptom limited period time . The FDA approve two type medication treat cognitive symptom ( memory loss , confusion , problem think reason ) AD : cholinesterase inhibitor Aricept , Exelon , Razadyne , Cognex memantine ( Namenda ) . Side effect include nausea , dizziness , confusion , vomit , headache , loss appetite , constipation , increase frequency bowel movement , possible liver damage . Current alternative treatment include Vitamin E. There medication approve specifically treat behavioral psychiatric AD symptom . However , antidepressant ; anxiolytic antipsychotic sometimes prescribed . As currently available treatment AD minimal limit short-term effectiveness mild symptom management best , potentially serious associate side-effects , low level laser therapy evaluate study simple , non-invasive side-effect free alternate mean improve cognition behavior symptom patient mild moderate AD . The underlying condition AD degeneration death nerve cell responsible memory cognition identify genetic contribution . Application low level laser therapy ( LLLT ) , coherent emission photon , show modulate cellular metabolism alter transcription factor responsible gene expression produce cell regeneration translate beneficial clinical effect . It therefore hypothesize mechanism , application LLLT individual AD effect improvement expression symptom AD . Prior Erchonia Corporation LLLT trial show beneficial clinical effect neurodegenerative neurodevelopment disorder Parkinson 's Disease Autism Spectrum Disorder .</detailed_description>
