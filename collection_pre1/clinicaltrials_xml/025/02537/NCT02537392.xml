	<brief_title>Multi-micronutrient Supplementation During Peri-conception Congenital Heart Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Congenital heart disease ( CHD ) among prevalent congenital abnormality incidence 8-12/1,000 live birth , also lead cause infant morbidity death birth defect . A series study point poor nutritional status mother peri-conception might important cause CHD . In maternal folic acid/ vitamin B deficiency homocysteine accumulate serum , elevate circulate homocysteine concentration associate risk CHD . However , still questionable whether multiple vitamin B supplement peri-conception reduce CHD risk effectively compare supplement folic acid alone . Moreover , one randomize control trial perform Shaanxi China confirm supplement iron folic acid pregnancy significantly reduce early neonatal death . It noteworthy one-fourth newborn death attributable birth defect . Thus , worthwhile investigate whether iron supplement reduce risk CHD . This community-based randomized control trial ass compare impact daily oral supplement vitamin B complex along folic acid supplement iron plus folic acid vs. folic acid alone give woman peri-conception CHD . It also assess effect three different supplementation pregnancy outcomes maternal health . The study conduct three rural poor county include Xunyi , Changwu , Bin , locate Shaanxi Province Northwest China . All participant sign inform consent study . The investigator hypothesize newborn infant woman receive supplement vitamin B complex along folic acid supplement iron plus folic acid experience reduction prevalence infant pulse oxygen saturation le 95 % adverse pregnancy outcome compare receive folic acid alone . The result trial provide evidence need formulate policy maternal micronutrient supplementation peri-conception rationale necessary investment public fund implement appropriate program birth defect .</detailed_description>
