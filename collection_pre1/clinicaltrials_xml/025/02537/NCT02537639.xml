	<brief_title>Impact Simulator-based Training Transoesophageal Echocardiography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Echocardiography currently sole image modality bedside provide real-time information cardiac anatomy function . Echocardiography increasingly use intensive care unit ( ICU ) set focus hemodynamic assessment patient cardiorespiratory compromise . The principal role focus echocardiography time-sensitive assessment symptomatic patient . This evaluation primarily include assessment pericardial effusion , evaluation relative chamber size , global cardiac valvular function patient volume status . The clinical impact echocardiography treatment critically ill patient hemodynamic compromise well document increase general consensus exist , physician charge critically ill patient train focussed echocardiography . Accordingly urgent need specific train echocardiography . Transoesophageal echocardiography ( TOE ) besides transthoracic echocardiography ( TTE ) main image modality ICU setting . TTE image quality often compromise lung inflation ventilate patient presence dressing drain location use image acquisition . It thus seem reasonable suggest every critical care physician able perform focus TOE . However , multitude barrier continue limit TOE train include time constraint busy ICUs , limited number appropriate case lack experienced teaching faculty . Proficiency TOE image acquisition require in-depth knowledge three-dimensional cardiac anatomy repetitive supervise hands-on experience develop necessary manual skill . Typically TOE skill acquisition occurs real time ICU care patient , thus time devoted training limit . However , use semi-invasive imaging modality ICU patient train solely train purpose problematic due associate ( minimal ) risk patient discomfort . Recently commercially available TOE simulation system introduce . These system allow patient-independent training TOE skills use simulation human heart . When used educational adjunct standardize TOE simulation train virtual reality environment may lead rapid development psychomotor skill . TOE simulator also offer possibility simulate pathological condition heart thus may facilitate training image interpretation . The purpose study determine effectiveness simulator base TOE train curriculum train necessary component focus critical care echocardiography accordance basic perioperative transesophageal examination define American Society Echocardiography Society Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists . This include psychomotor skill necessary obtain echocardiographic image sufficient quality accord establish quality score system ability recognize relevant anatomic structure well image interpretation evaluate hemodynamically compromise patient . Objective To evaluate effect simulator training transesophageal echocardiography Methods The investigator perform prospective , observational trial investigate impact simulator TOE training novice operator quality imaging , correct image interpretation resource use perform focus TOE examination ICU patient . Forty-fife ICU trainee without previous hands-on echocardiography skill undergo formal training consist 4 hour theoretical instruction include basic transesophageal echocardiography , cardiac anatomy , standard view well physiology pathophysiology . Instructions provide expert TOE operator . 30 trainee additionally train use HeartWorks TOE simulator . This training consist 4 session supervise practice use TOE simulator . After conclusion training program trainee perform one basic perioperative echocardiography study use HeartWorks TOE simulator two basic perioperative echocardiography study real ICU patient .</detailed_description>
