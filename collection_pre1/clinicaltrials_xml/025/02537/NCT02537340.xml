	<brief_title>PET/CT Staging Rectal Cancer Patients With Without EMVI-MR</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The accurate stag rectal cancer essential define therapy prognosis assessment . Imaging modality usually provide useful information pre-operative planning primary tumour resection may indicate need neoadjuvant treatment . It recommend use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) local stag compute tomography ( CT ) chest , abdomen pelvis detection distant metastasis . Patients rectal cancer vascular invasion might benefit intensive pre-operative stag order early detect distant metastasis , favour well therapeutic planning . There consensus regard use PET/CT initial stag patient rectal cancer . It show although change pattern 's patient ' stage , use PET/CT colorectal cancer impact disease management . New study require identify subgroup patient change pre-operative MR might benefit use PET/CT initial stag rectal cancer . Patients rectal cancer undergo pelvic MR , whole-body CT whole-body PET/CT . According tumour characteristic MR , define two group patient : EMVI-RM ( group A ) without EMVI-MR ( group B ) . The whole-body CT PET/CT evaluate detection loco-regional lymph node disease distant metastasis . The total number lesion respective site record compare method . The PET/CT management impact determine medical record direct contact treat clinician . The impact PET/CT management define high ( treatment modality intent change ) , medium ( treatment modality intent remain unchanged , although method treatment delivery plan diagnostic procedure change ) , low ( PET/CT result consistent planned management , treatment modality intent unchanged ) , none ( management plan change , despite inconsistent PET/CT stageâ€”that , PET/CT result ignore ) . Overall survival use evaluate prognostic significance . Clinical follow-up perform 3 monthly 2 year . Imaging , eventually biopsy , perform evaluate symptom sign suggestive residual recurrent disease .</detailed_description>
