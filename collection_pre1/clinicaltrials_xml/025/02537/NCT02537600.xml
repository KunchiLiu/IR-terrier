	<brief_title>Vemurafenib Cobimetinib Combination BRAF Mutated Melanoma With Brain Metastasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients enrol 3 cohort : - Cohort A : Neurologically asymptomatic patient receive prior local treatment ; - Cohort B. Neurologically asymptomatic patient receive prior local treatment ; - Cohort C. Neurologically symptomatic patient receive prior local treatment Every patient treat Vemurafenib 960 mg PO , twice daily D1 D28 , continuously Cobimetinib 60 mg PO , daily , D1 D21 - 1 cycle = 28 day Treatment administer progression ( intracranial extracranial ) , unacceptable toxicity , withdrawal consent , death decision treat investigator . Patients develop intracranial extracranial progression , opinion treat investigator , could benefit continue treatment may continue treatment vemurafenib cobimetinib approval principal investigator . Patients discontinue study treatment undergo end-of-treatment visit 30 day last dose vemurafenib and/or cobimetinib . Patients discontinue study treatment reason progression ( e.g . toxicity ) must follow every 8 week unless withdraw consent .</detailed_description>
