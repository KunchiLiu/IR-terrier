After determination maximum tolerate dose , expansion cohort 20 patient nonsmall cell lung cancer whose tumor demonstrate variant DNA repair pathway gene enrol . Measurable disease define lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) ≥ 10 mm CT scan , ≥ 20 mm chest xray , ≥ 10 mm caliper clinical exam . Prior treatment disease allow complete least 2 week prior study enrollment treatmentrelated toxicity resolve . Prior exposure PARP inhibitor allow patient dosefinding portion study . At least 18 year age . ECOG performance status ≤ 1 Normal bone marrow organ function define : Leukocytes ≥ 3,000/mcL Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcl Platelets ≥ 100,000/mcl Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x IULN AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 3.0 x IULN Creatinine ≤ IULN OR creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m^2 patient creatinine level institutional normal Tissue available sequencing ( either archival tissue readily accessible tumor fresh routine biopsy ) . Able swallow tablet . Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control , abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation .
