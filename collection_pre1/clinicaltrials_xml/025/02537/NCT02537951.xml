	<brief_summary>Small fiber neuropathy ( SFN ) common disorder , profound negative impact quality life severe neuropathic pain . To reliably establish diagnosis SFN challenging , since neurological examination nerve conduction study often normal . Autofluorescent flavoprotein imaging ( AFI ) optical method neuronal activity termination area small nerve fiber spinal cord quantify . Since epidermis also contain high density small nerve terminal since number intraepidermal nerve fiber greatly reduce patient SFN , hypothesis AFI intensity reduce patient SFN . To support hypothesis , pilot study require investigator first need confirm precision AFI epidermis third finger 10 healthy volunteer . Secondly , lidocaine/prilocaine cream use negative control . Finally , AFI signal measure application 8 % capsaicin patch , ( temporarily ) selective reduction small nerve fiber induce , mimic SFN . Using experimental design , investigator able test reliability validity AFI capsaicin-induced small nerve fiber degeneration . This would significant step develop objective , rapid non-invasive diagnostic tool diagnose patient SFN , may also utilized biomarker study assess efficacy novel treatment SFN .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The first aim current project test precision AFI epidermis 10 healthy volunteer . For purpose , range nociceptive electrical stimulus increase intensity ( 5Hz @ 0.5mA-1.0mA ) one innocuous control stimulus ( 2000Hz @ 1mA ) deliver third finger subject . The outcome measure AFI-intensity , change autofluorescence intensity compare baseline ( delta F/F ) . The standard deviation AFI intensity measure precision . Pearson 's correlation coefficient calculate electrical stimulus intensity AFI intensity . A linear correlation need confirm , since general characteristic AFI . A paired t-tests perform compare AFI intensity follow 5Hz @ 1mA stimulation 2000Hz @ 1mA stimulation . Lidocaine/prilocaine cream apply fingertips subject electrical stimulus repeat , serve negative control experiment . A repeated-measures ANOVA perform compare AFI intensity application lidocaine/prilocaine cream . The second aim study validate AFI experimentally induce small nerve fiber degeneration epidermis , compare AFI intensity subject one week application 8 % capsaicin patch third fingertip . A repeated-measures ANOVA perform compare AFI intensity capsaicin-induced small nerve fiber degeneration . Assuming subject develop epidermal small fiber degeneration follow 8 % capsaicin patch , statistically significant difference AFI intensity would serve proof-of-principle would provide validity autofluorescent flavoprotein image epidermal nociceptor activity diagnostic test SFN . Comparing distribution capsaicin-induced small nerve fiber degeneration lead probability estimation SFN base outcome measure , i.e . AFI intensity . In future research , false-positive false-negative consequence evaluate , lead cut-off value patient suspect SFN .</detailed_description>
