	<detailed_description>The overall goal project develop initial human data effect novel compound safety ( interaction cocaine ) efficacy ( subjective response cocaine self-administration data ) non-treatment seek cocaine use disorder subject . This project provide innovative data effect novel compound cocaine self-administration addition need safety data drug interaction cocaine . This Phase I human drug interaction study examine safety concurrent administration cocaine novel compound , effect novel compound subjective response cocaine cocaine self-administration non-treatment seek cocaine use disorder subject . This data provide important information go/no-go decision phase II clinical trial use medication tool enhance abstinence . The initial compound study 5-HT2CR agonist lorcaserin , show reduce cocaine self-administration cue reactivity rodent . In addition human safety data non-cocaine use subject lorcaserin currently FDA approve obesity , human cocaine interaction/PK data PD data support potential dosage phase II clinical trial . This single center , double-blind , placebo-controlled , randomize , 1b/2a study . 18 subject plan . Each subject administer single dose study drug three time , one week apart , consist time various dos active placebo . Each subject receive three four experimental treatment . Subjects assign treatment random order . Evaluations take baseline 4 hour 3 study visit . Screening data review determine subject eligibility . Subjects meet inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion enter study . If subject meet inclusion criterion , admit hospital inpatient 14 study day prevent drug alcohol use maintain complete monitoring adverse event . The following treatment regimen use : Lorcaserin 10mg daily increase 10mg twice daily . Placebo Comparator - identical placebo capsule administer time lorcaserin . Total duration subject participation include eligibility screening ( Study day -3 - 0 ) , on-unit study day ( Study day 1-14 ) , follow-up visit ( Study day 16 20 ) three week . Total duration study expect 18 month . Detailed description in-hospital portion study ( Study day 1-14 ) follow : After screen cocaine infusion determine safety , eligible subject randomize Group A -placebo Group B -placebo follow ascend dose lorcaserin . Six subject assign Group A ( placebo ) 12 subject assign Group B ( active lorcaserin ) . 1 . Days 1-2 : All subject receive placebo day 1-2 single blind fashion . Vital sign include heart rate , blood pressure respiration rate obtain 15 minute 15 , 30 60 minute placebo administration . Days 1-2 single-blind placebo , whereas remain study day double-blind . 2 . Days 3-9 : On day 3-9 , subject group A receive one placebo pill twice daily , group B receive one placebo pill morning one matching lorcaserin 10 mg pill even , total dose 10 mg daily . ECG QTc perform daily . If QTc prolong great 30ms baseline lorcaserin dosage hold . 3 . Days 10-12 : subject group B blind dosage increase 10 mg lorcaserin twice daily . Vital sign include heart rate , blood pressure respiration rate obtain 15 minute 15 , 30 60 minute placebo/lorcaserin administration . ECG QTc perform daily supervision study physician . If QTc prolong great 30ms baseline lorcaserin dosage hold . 4 . Day 13 subject group B administer 10mg lorcaserin morning , subject group A administer matching placebo morning . Subjects discharge day 14 . 5 . Cocaine Infusion Sessions ( Days 1 , 2 , 6 , 12 ) : All subject undergo ascend dose intravenous cocaine administration admission day 1 ensure safety later cocaine study . To assess safety subjective effect cocaine presence lorcaserin , subject receive ascend dos intravenous cocaine ( 10 mg , 20 mg , 40 mg ) , cocaine administration separate one hour . In addition , 0 mg cocaine ( saline ) infusion randomly give first dose cocaine order aid blinding investigator subject order drug administration . Infusions carry 9:00am , 10:00am , 11:00am 12:00pm ( Day 1 ) , 1:00 p.m. , 2:00 p.m. , 3:00 p.m. , 4:00 p.m. ( Days 2 , 6 , 12 ) .</detailed_description>
