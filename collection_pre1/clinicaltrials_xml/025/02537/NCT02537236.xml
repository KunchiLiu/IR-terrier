	<detailed_description>The infection Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ( AIDS ) , chronic condition transmissible progressive type viral cause , link different host virus , ultimately influence appearance opportunistic morbid process rare tumor , both1 . With prevalence 3 case every 1000 people 15 49 year , Mexico rank 16th place prevalence HIV/AIDS adult Latin America2 . The state Jalisco , México , occupy fourth place term positive case HIV-AIDS , plane , municipality Guadalajara , Zapopan , Tlaquepaque Puerto Vallarta Jalisco , represent main population high number positive case HIV-AIDS . The HIV positive individual Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy ( HAART ) without treatment face numerous challenge term management health ; disturb change visible shape appearance body . In case anatomical change come accompanied alteration biochemical indicator : lipid level ( cholesterol triglyceride ) insulin resistance4.These adverse effect may important clinical implication , severe lactic acidosis , coronary artery disease acute pancreatitis5 . In patient HIV HAART publish incidence hypercholesterolemia hypertriglyceridemia 5 90 % depend series , although true incidence yet determined6 . Pharmacological intervention statin fibrates patient infected HIV limit partially due drug interaction increase frequency adverse effects7 . Therefore , necessary investigate new alternative management dyslipidemia patient infect HIV HAART change diet supplement fish oil omega 3 fatty acid . Methods Patients : The investigator enrol 100 Patients positive Human Immunodeficiency Virus Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome , receive ≥2 Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy , diagnostic dislipidemia accord Mexican Official Standard Norms 2002 , prevention , treatment control dyslipidemias8 . All patient active SMART database HIV/AIDS department Civil Hospital Guadalajara `` Fray Antonio Alcalde '' . Patients exclude intolerance allergy fish , patient use use last 6 week supplement drug modify lipid . Study design During period January 2010 July 2011 , carry study authorization ethic committee Civil Hospital Guadalajara `` Fray Antonio Alcalde '' . Our subject assign 5 intervention group : Groups one= 20 subject receive Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes diet 1.05 gram Fatty Acid omega 3 . Groups two= 20 subject receive conventional diet 1.05 gram Fatty Acid omega three . Groups 3=20 subject receive Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes diet 2.10 gram Fatty Acid omega 3 . Groups four=20 subject receive conventional diet 2.10 gram Fatty Acid omega 3 . Groups five= 20 subject , control group receive conventional diet . The subject assign group one three TLC diet , receive advice nutritionist week 4 12 encourage consumption capsule omega 3 fatty acid , addition offer general recommendation consume dietary fiber fluid . The subject assign group two four conventional diet , receive advice nutritionist week 4 12 encourage consumption capsule omega 3 fatty acid without assistance special diet . The requirement energy macronutrients identified patient group one three . None subject receive advice physical activity could perform . Statistical analysis The main objective study compare change fast level triglyceride ( TG ) , total cholesterol ( TC ) , high density cholesterol ( HD-C ) , low density cholesterol ( LD-C ) , low density cholesterol ( VLD-C ) , body weight body mass index ( BMI ) week 4 12 . The safety tolerability study medication also secondary outcome . Statistical analysis carry start Kolmogorov-Smirnov test identify distribution variable , identify type distribution variable , continuous descriptive statistical analysis variable abnormal distribution -non-parametric , measure central tendency dispersion : median distance interquartiles variable normal distribution - parametric- : mean standard deviation . Inferential analysis intra-group use Wilcoxon test Friedman . For inferential analysis group implement variable non-normal distribution , Kruskal-Wallis test ; variable normal distribution use one-way ANOVA test . Differences consider statistically significant p value &lt; 0.05 . The data process use statistical package No.18.0 present table graphic .</detailed_description>
