In randomized clinical trial 216 child age 4 12 year community-based agency , follow aim propose : Aim 1 : To examine Stepped Care TF-CBT ( e.g. , start Step One parent-led , therapist-assisted treatment either maintenance Step Two TF-CBT ) relative standard TF-CBT ( e.g. , therapist-led treatment ) ; Aim 2 : To examine tailor variable could use individualize ( i.e. , tailor ) decision child assign baseline Stepped Care TF-CBT versus standard TF-CBT ; Aim 3 : To examine change potential mechanism change variable ( e.g. , fear arousal , maladaptive cognition , negative expectancy , fear toleration ) mediate treatment child PTSD symptom ( PTSS ) impairment ; Aim 4 : To examine economic cost delivering Stepped Care TF-CBT versus standard TF-CBT . Children PTSD considerable risk numerous biopsychosocial problem . Without accessible , effective treatment , problem tend persist adulthood . This study yield clinically important data improve value efficiency treatment child PTSD , thereby reduce childhood PTSD relate societal impact cost .</detailed_description>
