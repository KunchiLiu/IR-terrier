	<brief_summary>In study investigator aim assess enhance neuroplasticity dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) work memory - key function DLPFC - patient mild Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . The investigator use Paired Associative Stimulation ( PAS ) paradigm measure neuroplasticity 4-week course high-frequency repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( rTMS ) DLPFC enhance cognitive function . Clinical cognitive assessment do baseline , one week , one month 6 month rTMS course . Healthy control also enrol carry baseline cognitive assessment baseline measurement neuroplasticity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific aim 1 : To assess work memory participant Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) change response 4-week course bilateral rTMS DLPFC . Hypothesis 1a : Compared healthy individual , participant AD impaired N-back task . Hypothesis 1b : Compared sham rTMS , active rTMS result improvement N-back task participant AD 1 week 4 week treatment . Specific aim 2 : To assess DLPFC theta-gamma couple work memory performance AD change response 4-week course bilateral rTMS DLPFC . Hypothesis 2a : Compared healthy individual , participant AD impaired DLPFC theta-gamma couple N-back task . Hypothesis 2b &amp; 2c : Compared sham rTMS , active rTMS result improvement DLPFC theta-gamma couple N-back task participant AD 1 week 4 week treatment . Specific aim 3 : To assess DLPFC neuroplasticity use PAS participant AD change response 4-week course bilateral rTMS . Hypothesis 3a : Compared healthy individual , participant AD impaired PAS-induced neuroplasticity . Hypothesis 3b : Compared sham rTMS , active rTMS result improvement PAS-induced neuroplasticity participant AD 1 week 4 week treatment . Specific aim 4 : To assess change work memory , theta gamma couple DLPFC neuroplasticity 6 month course bilateral rTMS . Hypothesis 4 : Compared sham rTMS , active rTMS group perform good measure work memory , theta gamma couple PAS- induced DLPFC neuroplasticity 6 month course rTMS . Specific aim 5 : To assess change general cognitive function 4 week 6 month course bilateral rTMS . Hypothesis 5 : Compared sham rTMS , active rTMS group perform good measure general cognitive function 4 week 6 month course rTMS . Specific Aim 6 : To assess insight AD baseline change insight 4 week 6 month post rTMS follow . H6 : Participants AD impaired insight illness cognitive function experience improve insight 4 week 6 month follow point . Specific Aim 7 : To validate new scale insight AD , 'The Scale Assess Anosognosia Neurocognitive Disorders ' ( SAND ) ability ass insight baseline change 4 week 6 month follow point . H7 : In participant AD , SAND able ass insight illness cognitive function baseline , able detect change insight follow point .</detailed_description>
