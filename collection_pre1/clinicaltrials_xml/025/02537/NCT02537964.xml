	<brief_summary>This prospective , control ; crossover study daily bath no-rinse , 2 % chlorhexidine gluconate ( CHG ) impregnate washcloths versus bath water/soap water accord gestational age weight ( e.g . standard bathing ) . The trial take place Neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ) . Baseline data ragarding bloodstream infection ( BSI ) colonization multidrug resistant orgnisms ( MDRO ) collect 3-6 month prior patient enrollment . In preliminary phase study establish safety chlorhexidine bath use Clinell ® Chlorhexidine wash cloth three group patient : term infant admit NICU ; late preterm infant ( 34-37 week ) ; preterm infant 30-34 week gestation . Interim analysis adverse event perform group patient . In subsequent phase study , infant admit NICU enrol study bath three time week Chlorhexidine wash cloth initial 6-months study period ( intervention ) , follow standard bath second 6-months period , intervention period 6 month standard bath 6-months .

	<detailed_description>The study take place Neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ) Shaare-Zedek Medical Center Baseline data ragarding bloodstream infection ( BSI ) colonization multidrug resistant orgnisms ( MDRO ) collect 3-6 month prior patient enrollment . Preliminary study : In order establish safety , enroll infant admit NICU three successive treatment group , follow : first group include term infant admit NICU ( gestational age 37+6 &gt; 7 day old ) , second group include near-term infant ( gestational age &gt; 34+0 36+6 week &gt; 7 day old ) third group include premature infant ( gestational age &gt; 30+0 33+6 &gt; =10 day old ) . We intend enroll 20 patient group , minimum 200 patient day per group . All infant assign bath three time week washcloth impregnate 2 % chlorhexidine gluconate ( Clinell ® Chlorhexidine wash cloth , GAMA healthcare ) duration NICU stay . The infant 's skin monitor continuously describe . In case grade 3 4 reaction , study intervention temporarily suspend , adverse event report Helsinky committee study steer committee . If grade 3 4 reaction encounter least 200 patient day per group , enrollment subsequent group perform ( e.g grade 3-4 reaction encounter 200 patient day group 1 , start enrol patient group 2 etc. ) . If grade 3-4 dermatitis encounter preliminary study , initiate enrollment describe . In subsequent phase study , : All infant NICU eligible study assign bath three time week washcloth impregnate 2 % chlorhexidine gluconate ( Clinell ® Chlorhexidine wash cloth , GAMA healthcare ) initial 6-months study period ( intervention ) , follow standard bath second 6-months period , intervention period 6 month standard bath 6-months . Total study period- 2.5 year . Inclusion criterion : infant weigh ≥1500 gram &gt; =10 day age ; parent ' informed consent Exclusion criterion : infant weigh &lt; 1500 gram &lt; 10 day age ; parent ' refusal sign inform consent . For standard bathing procedure see appendix 1 . Before study initiation , well begin study period , nurse instruct proper technique bath patient . Bathing perform accord product brochure , three time week . Outcome measure A . Number bacteremia episode per 1000 patient day intervention period compare control period . B . Number new patient colonize methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) , vancomycin resitant enterococcus ( VRE ) , carbapenem resistant Acinetobacter baumanii ( CRAB ) extend spectrum beta-lactamase ( ESBL ) produce organisms per total number patient , monthly range variance . C. Number new patient colonize MRSA , VRE , CRAB ESBL per 1000 eligible patient day [ Total patient day - total patient day patient identified multidrug resistant organism ( MDRO ) ] D. Time colonization MDRO intervention period compare control period . Data collection : Each patient admit NICU study period meet inclusion criterion , record assign specific study number . The date admission date discharge record used calculate length stay determine incidence nosocomial infection base microbiological data . Clinical laboratory data , include use invasive device ( intravascular device , mechanical ventilation , feed tube ) collect standardized form . The data cod password protect database link study patient identifier . Infections MDRO acquisition monitor study period . Events occur within 2 day transition assign previous bathing period . For infection surveillance , daily review culture new order antibiotic therapy perform study participant . Infectious event evaluate independent investigator blind intervention period . Active surveillance test MDRO perform every two week study period . Swabs nasopharynx ( MRSA ) ] rectal area ( ESBL produce organism , VRE CRAB ) obtain unit staff process microbiology laboratory Shaare-Zedek Medical Center . Trial oversight : The steer committee study include , except PI , Infectious Disease physician neonatologist . There biweekly discussion progress report , report compliance active surveillance , report compliance bathing , adverse reaction problem . Statistical analysis Changes rate BSI clinical sepsis compare intervention control period . Continuous variable examine use two-sample t-tests linear regression modeling , categorical variable examine mean Fisher 's exact test . Cox proportional-hazards regression model use compare time admission first primary bloodstream infection , clinical sepsis acquisition MDRO control intervention period . Sample size calculation : base ongoing surveillance , 2-3 BSI event per 1000 patient -days NICU . In order detect 50 % reduction BSI rate , investigator need 37,096 patient day ( 18,548 group ) order 80 % power reject null hypothesis , 0.05 level significance . Currently , average annual census 45,000 patient day . therefore , 2-year study &gt; 80 % power reject null hypothesis ( BSI rate control period equal rate intervention period ) . Safety monitoring . A study evaluate tolerability 2 % CHG catheter insertion antisepsis among infant ≥1500 gram ≥7 day old find significant dermatitis reaction . Seven 48 infant measurable CHG level blood . In trial evaluate multifactorial approach reduce rate CLABSI , Andersen et al . note 4 36 neonate &lt; 1000g develop contact dermatitis 2 % CHG scrub . There episodes contact dermatitis 49 study participant ≥1000g . The alternative antisepsis neonates povidone-iodine . However , iodine absorption may compromise thyroid function one reason explore use CHG . Although CHG report absorbed neonatal skin several trial , significant systemic side effect report ' . Animal trial show significant toxicity CHG . The US Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) state drug fact box 2 % CHG cloth : '' use care premature infants infant 2 month age . These product may cause irritation chemical burn '' . Each participant 's skin examine daily nursing staff twice week study personnel . Skin reaction grade recorded standard report form ( appendix 2 ) . Grade 3 4 skin reaction report serious adverse event .</detailed_description>
