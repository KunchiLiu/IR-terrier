	<brief_title>A Study Ibrutinib + Obinutuzumab Patients With Relapsed Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study Phase I clinical trial , test safety investigational intervention also try define best order administration two drug . `` Investigational '' mean intervention study . The FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve ibrutinib obinutuzumab individually treatment patient Chronic Lymphomcytic Leukemia , type cancer . However , FDA approve combination two drug treatment disease . Ibrutinib type drug call kinase inhibitor . It believe block type protein call kinase help leukemia cell live grow . By block , possible study drug kill cancer cell stop grow . Obinutuzumab type drug call monoclonal antibody . It believe attach protein call CD20 outside Chronic Lymphomcytic Leukemia cell . By attach cell , antibody cause Chronic Lymphomcytic Leukemia cell die . In research study , investigator assess safety various dose regimen ibrutinib obinutuzumab . The investigator try determine whether good give one drug start time .</detailed_description>
