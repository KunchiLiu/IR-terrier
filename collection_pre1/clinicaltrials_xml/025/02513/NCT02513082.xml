	<brief_summary>This study aim compare effectiveness adductor canal block femoral nerve block total knee arthroplasty general anesthesia . Two block technique prove safe effective pain control total knee arthroplasty . But author insist quadriceps muscle power decrease femoral nerve block . The study design double-blind randomized control trial . Fifty patient plan undergo simultaneously bilateral total knee arthroplasty randomise receive ultrasound-guided femoral nerve block one leg adductor canal block , addition combine general anaesthesia . The primary outcome comparative postoperative pain either extremity four , eight , 12 , 24 , 72 hour 7days postoperatively . Secondary comparative outcome include motor strength cybex test .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness Pain Relief Between Adductor Canal Block Femoral Nerve Block Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) popular nowadays . But almost patient complain postoperative pain affect delay early mobilization prevent knee stiffness , lessen hospital stay improve overall patient satisfaction outcome TKA . Intravenous patient-controlled analgesia ( PCA ) epidural analgesia conventional postoperative analgesia . Recently block technique like adductor canal block femoral nerve block know good method pain relief TKA . However , femoral nerve block reduces quadriceps muscle strength thereby potentially compromise postoperative mobilization . Therefore , necessary evaluate effectiveness pain treatment preservation muscle function procedure adductor canal block femoral nerve block . The present study aim determine compare efficacy adductor canal block femoral nerve block combine general anesthesia ( 1 ) postoperative pain control , ( 2 ) early patient ambulation functional recovery ( 3 ) change muscle power total knee arthroplasty .</detailed_description>
