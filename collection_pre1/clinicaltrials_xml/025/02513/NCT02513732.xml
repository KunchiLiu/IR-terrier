	<detailed_description>Based Good Post-marketing Study Practice ( GPSP ) regulation , general patient population ischemic heart disease eligible treatment XIENCE Xpedition Everolimus-Eluting 2.25mm Stent register , particular inclusion/exclusion criterion , may eligible angiographic follow-up eight month clinical follow-up one year . The XIENCE Xpedition 2.25 mm stent compose stent identical stent XIENCE PRIME SV Stent.Therefore , data collect PMS pool data collect ongoing XIENCE PRIME SV PMS analysis .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient inform consent require registration PMS . In case patient informed consent ( provide type information ) require PMS per participate site policy , Sponsor cooperate need . If know time index procedure patient able return 8month followup visit angiogram 1year clinical followup , patient register PMS . Patients attend attend PMS invasive medical procedure register . Patients treat XIENCE Xpedition 2.25mm stent register . The observation compile perpatient basis even multiple XIENCE Xpedition 2.25mm stent implanted index procedure . A patient whose sidebranch treat XIENCE Xpedition 2.25mm stent register . In case , main vessel treat XIENCE Xpedition . The observation compile perpatient basis patient treat XIENCE Xpedition 2.25mm stent overlap stent bailout purpose . Additional revascularization procedure part adverse event treatment plan stag procedure consider another registration , adverse event . A patient treat , fail implanted XIENCE Xpedition 2.25mm stent finally treat device ( No XIENCE Xpedition 2.25mm stent implant ) must also register . In case , stent information , device deficiency information reportable adverse event related Xpedition stent , , require capture . Followup patient receive XIENCE Xpedition 2.25mm stent require . A patient may another lesion ( ) may treat large diameter ( â‰¥ 2.5mm ) stent ( ) . In case , treatment XIENCE Xpedition preferable . Lesion ( ) treat XIENCE Xpedition 2.25mm stent consider target lesion .</criteria>
