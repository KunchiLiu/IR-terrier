	<brief_title>Insomnia Cardiovascular Diseases : Influence Behavioral Treatments Preferences</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Significance : Accumulating evidence indicate sleep quantity ( low number sleep hour ) quality ( subjective complaint insomnia ) associate increase risk cardiovascular disease even control cardiovascular risk factor . The prevalence insomnia increase age . Assisting middle-aged older adult manage insomnia essential promote sleep , reduce anxiety depression , reduce risk cardiovascular disease . Two behavioral treatment , stimulus control instruction ( SCI ) sleep restriction therapy ( SRT ) establish treatment insomnia . However , treatment demand commitment change one 's habit lifestyle . Preferences treatment find influence adherence , outcomes treatment . The study provide experimental evidence extent improve sleep quantity quality reduce risk cardiovascular disease , SCI SRT effective achieve outcomes . The study first examine satisfaction treatment mechanism mediate influence preference treatment adherence outcomes . Objectives : The study address substantive methodological area interest funding opportunity . The substantive objective : 1 ) examine direct effect SCI SRT sleep ( quantity quality ) , psychological ( anxiety , depression ) , physical ( cardiovascular symptom event ) outcome , 2 ) examine indirect effect SCI SRT psychological physical outcome , mediate sleep quantity quality . The methodological objective : 1 ) compare participant randomize treatment participant allocate treatment choice attrition , satisfaction treatment , adherence treatment , sleep , psychological physical outcome ; 2 ) among randomized participant , compare receive receive prefer treatment attrition , satisfaction , adherence treatment , sleep , psychological , physical outcome ; , 3 ) explore extent satisfaction treatment mediate influence preference treatment adherence outcome . Design : A two-stage partially randomize clinical trial use . Eligible participant randomize random preference arm trial . In random arm , participant randomly assign no-treatment , SCI SRT . In preference arm , participant allocate SCI SRT base preference . Outcome data collect 4 time point : pretest , posttest , 6-month 12-month follow-up . Sample : Non-institutionalized , cognitively intact , adult ( &gt; 40 year ) include complain difficulty initiate and/or maintain sleep ( &gt; 30 minute per night , &gt; 3 night per week , &gt; 6 week ) associate sleep apnea .
