	<brief_summary>Cancer gullet ( oesophagus ) lethal disease 15 % patient survive 5 year diagnose . It common men woman , men appear bad prognosis . One suggestion gender difference sex hormone oestrogen , exerts effect via oestrogen receptor . The role oestrogen breast cancer well describe , antioestrogen medication tamoxifen , block oestrogen receptor widespread effective use . The role oestrogen receptor oesophageal cancer however , less well define . Work conduct investigator , well another research group Australia show antioestrogens include tamoxifen , reduce oesophageal cancer cell growth laboratory . To date , study assess effect tamoxifen therapy oesophageal cancer growth human . The investigator propose study determine effect tamoxifen patient oesophageal cancer n't undergo surgery chemotherapy . Patients receive tamoxifen tablet daily 4 week time biopsy ( sample cancer tissue ) take gastroscopy ( flexible camera pass mouth gullet stomach ) . The biopsy compare biopsy take time diagnosis determine tamoxifen effect cancer cell growth . If study show tamoxifen slow cancer cell growth could lead large study patient oesophageal cancer take tamoxifen long time period determine clinical benefit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tamoxifen Patients With Oesophageal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Oesophageal cancer eighth common cancer worldwide , United Kingdom ( UK ) , world 's high incidence oesophageal adenocarcinoma . The 5- year survival patient diagnosed oesophageal cancer 2010-2011 England Wales 15 % . Ten- year survival oesophageal cancer UK rank third low 20 common cancer , one-third patient candidate surgical resection presentation . Interestingly , oesophageal cancer male dominant disease male : female ratio 5:1 10:1 . Most published epidemiological evidence unable find difference exposure know risk factor oesophageal cancer two gender , suggest oestrogen , exerts effect via oestrogen receptor , could responsible gender bias . Recent work investigator Academic Unit ( Faculty Medicine Health Sciences , University Nottingham , Royal Derby Hospital , Derby ) , find increase expression oestrogen receptor oesophageal cancer compare match normal mucosal sample , up-regulation oestrogen receptor associate poor survival outcome . This association oestrogen receptor expression oesophageal cancer also demonstrate numerous study . The investigator research also show block oestrogen receptor use highly selective antagonist ( MPP PHTPP ) selective oestrogen receptor modulators , tamoxifen raloxifene significantly inhibit oesophageal cancer cell proliferation vitro ( p &lt; 0.05 ) . Similar finding find another research group use tamoxifen raloxifene . To date , publish study assess effect tamoxifen patient oesophageal adenocarcinoma vivo . The investigator propose initial pilot study determine effect short-term tamoxifen biological parameter oesophageal cancer . Determination biological response potentially allow phase I study determine clinical response . The biological response treatment assess immunohistochemistry use monoclonal antibody Ki67 , nuclear antigen present throughout cell cycle ( GI , S , G2 M phase ) proliferate cell absent quiescent ( GO ) cell . The percentage change Ki67 expression oesophageal cancer biopsy tissue take diagnosis ( pre- tamoxifen ) , pair biopsy take 4 week tamoxifen provide information antitumor effect tamoxifen oesophageal cancer . Ki67 expression use biomarker tamoxifen therapy numerous breast cancer study match breast core biopsy specimens fine needle aspiration cytology specimens 20-36 . Of study review , report decrease Ki67 expression , significant 10 18 study median 28 day ( range : 14 - 84 day ) 20mg/ day tamoxifen , median 51 patient ( 10 - 201 patient ) . The use Ki67 biomarker tamoxifen therapy also use study 24 patient cervical cancer receive 80mg tamoxifen 5 day . The study report drop median Ki67 Labelling Index 5.6 % pre- tamoxifen biopsy tissue 3.0 % post- tamoxifen ( P &lt; 0.001 ) . The cervical cancer biopsy sample use similar size oesophageal biopsy use study , confident measure Ki67 expression suitable biomarker available assess biological response tamoxifen . Tamoxifen gold standard endocrine treatment oestrogen receptor positive breast cancer 30 year , follow FDA-approval US Food Drug Administration 1977 . It estimate 400,000 woman alive today result tamoxifen , million benefit palliation extend disease-free survival . It initially license use metastatic disease , follow use adjuvant setting , recently commission breast cancer chemoprevention National Institute Health Care Excellence . A meta-analyses 20 trial show tamoxifen treatment associate reduction disease recurrence 39 % , mortality 30 % . The hope patient oesophageal cancer treat tamoxifen would improve clinical outcome similar observe patient breast cancer . To observe clinical benefit patient would take tamoxifen extended period time like breast cancer , adjuvant setting , treatment 5 year , may increase 10 year even clinical benefit accord evidence report two recent phase III trial . Currently , enough evidence available justify study long-term tamoxifen patient oesophageal cancer , initial pilot study determine biological response oesophageal cancer short-term tamoxifen . Despite widespread use , optimal vivo therapeutic concentration range tamoxifen remain establish lack dose-response study , high degree inter-individual variability steady-state level tamoxifen metabolite . Patients enrol study receive 80mg tamoxifen first 4 day follow 20mg/ day thereafter . This regimen chosen achieve plasma steady state sooner 4 - 16 week take standard dose 20mg/ day . Although publish study report time steady state achieve exact load dose regimen , study patient metastatic breast cancer report load dose schedule 80mg/ day 7 day follow 20 mg/ day thereafter , allow steady-state value reach one week . Studies describe pharmacokinetics standard dose tamoxifen ( 10-30mg/ day ) , report steady state serum level 100ng/ml 333ng/ml , level sufficient induce oesophageal adenocarcinoma cell growth arrest vitro . The load dose tamoxifen maintenance regimen propose sufficient observe effect cancer cell growth vivo plasma steady state level achievable dose sufficient concentration inhibit oesophageal cell growth two vitro study . A load dose 80mg/ day choose high dose report literature n't associate increase risk serious adverse event . Tamoxifen use infertility treatment many year licence use UK anovulatory infertility dose 80mg/ day 4 consecutive day . Numerous study report outcomes dos 20mg - 80mg/ day 3 - 8 day , serious adverse event thromboembolism stroke report . In addition infertility treatment , study metastatic renal cell carcinoma ( 8 week ) , cervical cancer ( 5 day ) metastatic breast cancer ( 7 day ) report outcomes 80mg/ day also report serious adverse event . A period 4 day choose load dose regimen already license duration UK majority study report safety 80mg/ day time period . Having review literature , investigator feel load dose regimen 80mg/ day 4 day high safe dose allow plasma steady state achieve quickly possible , allow sufficient time observe biological effect tamoxifen oesophageal cancer , allow valid conclusion make . The rationale load dose regimen limit time recruitment ( start tamoxifen ) biopsy , ensure patient well enough attend gastroscopy , well know cohort patent experience deterioration quality life .</detailed_description>
