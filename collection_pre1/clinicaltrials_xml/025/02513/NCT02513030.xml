	<brief_title>Cardioverter Defibrillator Replacement With Induction Ventricular Fibrillation Defibrillation Testing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : The need intraoperative defibrillation test ( DT ) implant and/ replacement implantable cardioverter-defibrillators ( ICDs ) still debate . The primary assumption intra-operative DT successful defibrillation time implant predict successful treatment clinical ventricular arrhythmia . However , utility long stand practice era modern efficient ICD system recently question . DT proven improve clinical outcome , relevance test shock clinical shock question , probabilistic nature successful shock emphasize . Furthermore , test may increase risk , complexity cost ICD implant . This issue address recent Shockless IMPLant Evaluation ( SIMPLE ) study . The trial demonstrate routine defibrillation test time ICD implant safe , improve shock efficacy reduce mortality compare no-testing strategy . It therefore expect result SIMPLE trial lead significant reduction abandonment practice VF test time initial ICD implant . Nevertheless induction VF testing purpose ( VFT ) may still important role selective population risk defibrillation failure , include SIMPLE study . One population undergo device replacement . Whereas test replacement seldom do , conceivable test go much high yield initial implantation . In fact , result Canadian ICD registry demonstrate high rate finding ( 30 % ) VF induced device replacement . However , conceivable since patient undergo test , actually test comprised select population high likelihood failure . Testing time replacement potential uncover lead problem specifically high voltage lead . Lovelock et al . find ICD generator replacement dramatically increase risk subsequent Fidelis lead failure majority failure occur within matter month procedure . Failure rate generator replacement recall non- recalled lead know . It possible manipulation proximal portion lead replacement maybe clinically silent lead defect present prior generator exchange surgical manipulation accelerate deterioration . Moreover , high energy shock describe expose insulation defect previously discover low energy shock noninvasive measurement . Safety DFT also concern . The primary complication relate DT include : systemic embolism intra-cardiac thrombus , prolong post-DT hypotension electro-mechanical dissociation , myocardial infarction , heart failure , cerebral anoxia , need intubation , prolonged anesthesia , chest compression complication anesthesia . The large study date specifically evaluate concern SIMPLE study . The primary safety endpoint , comprise complication within 30 day implant , also similar two patient group ( 5.4 per cent ) no-DT group vs. 6.5 per cent routine DT group , p=0.25 ) . Thus , despite question regard need routine defibrillation test , least generally safe may still suitable certain patient physician 's discretion . The SIMPLE study large one , last quite year due design randomize controlled trial follow need reach endpoint . The investigator aim conduct observational pilot study look frequency positive finding VF test . The comparator rate finding test Simple trial . If investigator find increased rate finding ( significantly high Simple trial ) may set stage randomize control trial replacement , along line Simple trial , recommendation continue VF test ICD replacement . Study Objective : The investigator plan evaluate rate follow outcomes subject undergoing device replacement : 1 . Failed DT 2 . System malfunction require intervention 3 . Complications associate DT pocket generator change Secondary goal include assessment device longevity , specific ICD lead model performance , defibrillation efficacy , complication , association replacement surgical technique ( i.e capsulectomy , electrosurgery setting etc . ) , data lead management failure identify ( add new lead , extraction etc . ) rate infection ( i.e . association type antibiotic , IV v PO , use pouch etc . ) The primary endpoint sub-study composite procedure relate complication include : 30-day procedure relate infection , major bleeding ( ( i.e prolong hospital stay , reguiring intervention PC unit ) new electrode dysfunction . Study design : This prospective observational multi-center study DF test patient undergoing device replacement participate center . All center follow DF test protocol whereas management positive finding discretion treat physician , program device follow testing . Primary Endpoint : Demonstrate event rate primary outcome ( defined failure DT single shock 10 J maximal capacity device Secondary Endpoints : The investigator plan ass follow outcome determine independent predictor occurrence : 1 . Rate system malfunction require intervention 2 . Complications associate DT pocket generator change . 3 . Device longevity specific ICD lead model performance 4 . Lead management decision case lead failure identify ( add new lead , extraction etc . ) 5 . Procedure related infection opt management ( i.e . association type antibiotic , IV vs. PO , use pouch etc . ) 6 . Association surgical replacement technique ( i.e capsulectomy , electrosurgery setting etc . ) pre-specified complication rate Patients undergo generator replacement accord local procedure standard practice . A minimum standard VF evaluation single shock 10 J maximal capacity device . If unsuccessful investigator encourage use appropriate method test attain successful defibrillation . More extensive testing permit , investigator deem necessary . Investigators free use method anesthesia patient monitor feel appropriate . All detail operative procedure include total partial capsulectomy do , DT conduct , intra-operative complication device detail capture time implantation . The investigator also collect data longevity device ( time implantation replacement ) , use antibiotic ( IV and/or local , capsulectomy use plasma knife ) . Operators encourage high-voltage impedance test within normal range device , confirm integrity high-voltage circuit patient . HV lead impedance document . In case SJM Riata lead fluoroscopy lead do LAO 30 RAO 20 document . VF testing : Patients undergo induction ventricular fibrillation ( preferably Shock T leave operator discretion ) implant procedure . For study , one shock 10J maximal device capacity program . If successful defibrillation achieve , recommend reasonable effort make achieve criterion ( i.e . addition new lead/removal coil array , polarity reversal operator discretion ) follow repeat intra-operative testing . Testing shall stop investigator deems likelihood improve DFT continue test outweighed risk . A reason stop shall document . Test shock do new pocket generator old one . Follow : 6-monthly Follow-up visit : include documentation peri-operative complication . Patients also follow clinical endpoint ( occurrence appropriate shock , inappropriate shock , lead failure , need re- intervention infection ) . Study visit coincide much possible routine clinical visit , allow flexibility ± 1 month . Patients follow 6 monthly interval last patient randomize received 6 month follow . Contact information ( family physician , next kin ) obtain baseline , individual may contact follow-up ensure completeness follow-up . Sample Size Calculation : This observational study order prove replacement carry high risk significant finding compare primary implantation ( SIMPLE trial ) , investigator need 140 patient order detect absolute difference 7 % rate primary endpoint ( failure terminate induced arrhythmia due lead failure ) power 90 % 2-tailed alpha 0.05 . This calculation base estimation 10 % primary endpoint event rate study population report precision ± 5 % . Sample size calculation account 10 % overall attrition rate . Budget calculate assumption 500 $ per patient fee participate center plus study coordination management cost . The study manage Israeli Association Cardiovascular Trials ( IACT ) .</detailed_description>
