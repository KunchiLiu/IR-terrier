	<brief_summary>Pseudotumor cerebri , also call idiopathic intracranial hypertension ( IIH ) , characterize elevate intracranial pressure , headache , severe , vision loss . IIH difficult treat . Medical management may adequately resolve symptom , surgical management ( primarily cerebrospinal fluid [ CSF ] shunt ) high failure rate . Recently , relationship IIH stenosis dural venous sinus ( vein drain blood brain ) report . In patient IIH stenosis one dural venous sinus , place stent venous sinus may improve patient ' objective symptom ( visual loss papilledema ) subjective symptom ( headache ) . This study determine whether dural venous sinus stenting effective CSF shunting ( consider standard surgical treatment ) treat IIH patient moderate vision loss stenosis dural venous sinus .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Screening evaluation : Screening include standard-of-care IIH evaluation include general medical neurological examination , blood chemistry , complete blood count , prothrombin time ( PT ) , partial thromboplastin time ( PTT ) , pregnancy test . Ophthalmological evaluation include visual acuity , pellucid marginal degeneration ( PMD ) , optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) . Quality life assessment Headache Impact Test-6 , Short Form Health Survey-36 Visual Function Questionnaire-25 + Neuro-Ophthalmology supplement test . Participants must recent ( within 6 month enrollment ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) brain well diagnostic lumbar puncture ( include opening pressure , cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) cell count , CSF glucose CSF protein ) , also part standard care diagnosis IIH . Eligible patient undergo outpatient diagnostic venography within one month initial IIH evaluation . Under local anesthesia , transfemoral venous access obtain guide catheter place right jugular bulb . A microcatheter ( Excelsior SL-10 , Stryker Neurovascular ) advance dural venous sinus , venography perform determine presence dural venous sinus stenosis . Then , blood pressure transduce microcatheter follow anatomic location : Anterior superior sagittal sinus , posterior superior sagittal sinus , bilateral transverse sinus , bilateral sigmoid sinuses bilateral jugular bulb . The venous pressure gradient define difference pressure measurement anatomic location proximal distal stenotic venous sinus segment , transverse sigmoid sinus . A pressure gradient ≥ 8 mmHg consider sufficient subsequent randomization . In patient pressure gradient &lt; 8 mmHg , patient randomize . Subsequent visit : Once patient meet eligibility criterion undergone randomization , treatment occur within two week Neuro-Ophthalmology evaluation within one month diagnostic venography . Follow-up visit occur two week , six month one year index procedure . At two-week follow-up ( within one week either side ) , patient undergo neurological ophthalmological evaluation , OCT , perimetry , visual acuity test safety . While perimetry point use primary outcome analysis , substantial worsen measure despite treatment prompt consideration treatment failure . At six-month follow-up , subject undergo perimetry primary outcome analysis , outpatient diagnostic cerebral venography , pressure measurement identical screen evaluation ( include pressure measurement predefined anatomical location ) within four week either side six-month target date . Patients also complete follow-up quality life questionnaire ( HIT-6 , SF-36 VFQ-25 + Neuro-Ophthalmology supplement ) The one-year follow-up include query regard interim medical history , headache status , medication usage ( specifically detail dose agent use treat IIH headache ) , number IIH-related procedure subject undergone since index procedure . Follow-up occur within four week either side one-year target date .</detailed_description>
