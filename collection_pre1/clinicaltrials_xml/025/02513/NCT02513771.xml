	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate whether sitagliptin ( Januvia brand name sitagliptin ) reduce inflammation immune activation marker HIV-infected men woman compare placebo ( inactive medication like dummy pill ) . The study evaluate whether take 100 mg sitagliptin mouth daily 16 week safe effective HIV-infected person antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) diabetes . Sitagliptin medication use treat people diabetes ( high blood sugar ) also may reduce inflammation body .</brief_summary>
