They exclude know Crohn 's , inflammatory bowel disease , previous bowel resection , bariatric surgery , psoriasis . They able participate artificial long fingernail want cut testing , regularly take medication might affect endothelial function anti-inflammatory medication , statin , anti-hypertensive medication , daily aspirin , non-SSRI psychotropic medication , dietary supplement include vitamin D supplement . Enrollment Visit The day prior enrollment visit potential subject fast overnight refrain consume caffeinated product , vitamin , medication may affect vascular tone refrain smoking . investigator explain 10 week study design obtain participant consent . Testing perform morning start time 8 10:00 a.m . In quiet temperature-controlled room ( 72° 75° F ) , initial systolic diastolic blood pressure measurement follow 5 minute seat rest follow American Heart Association Blood Pressure Guidelines . The arm support heart level neither participant observer talk measurement . Three successive measurement collect automate oscillometric sphygmomanometer average last two measurement calculate . Any individual average blood pressure &gt; 140/90 mmHg refer personal physician follow . Consented participant blood pressure reading &lt; 140/90 mmHg instruct consume usual diet next week complete three-day diet record two week day one weekend . Instructions record dietary diary give . Food record use estimate usual dietary intake baseline 10 week time point . An appointment schedule participant return complete food record begin intervention study . At baseline clinic visit 10 week supply vitamin D3 supplement ( 2,000 IU/day ; lot ; Nature Made ® ) give participant log sheet provide record supplement intake . In addition , participant instruct avoid travel sunny location 10 week . Baseline 10 week clinic visit Nutrient intake : Three-day diet record collect baseline 10 week clinic visit . Food record analyze TWU utilize University Minnesota 2015 Nutrient Data System Research . Total energy intake ; percent calorie fat , protein carbohydrate ; intake vitamins A , C , D , E beta carotene estimate food record . Blood pressure measurement : Participants fast overnight refrain consume caffeinated product , vitamin , medication may affect vascular tone , smoke . Testing perform morning start time 8 10:00 a.m . In quiet temperature-controlled room ( 72° 75° F ) , initial systolic diastolic blood pressure measurement take follow 5 minute seat rest follow American Heart Association Blood Pressure Guidelines . The arm support heart level neither participant observer talk measurement . Three successive measurement collect automate oscillometric sphygmomanometer average last two measurement calculate . Body fat adiposity measure : Anthropometric body fat distribution assessment perform . Height weight measure . Percent body fat determine bioelectric impedance ( Tanita BF-350 ) . Body mass index ( BMI ) calculate weight kilogram ( kg ) divide height square ( m2 ) . Endothelial pulse amplitude measurement : Pulse amplitude tonometry ( PAT ) measure EndoPAT 2000 ( Itamar Medical Ltd ) record digital pulse wave amplitude ( PWA ) use fingertip plethysmography ( 16 ) . The Endo-PAT finger probe consist thimble-shaped sensor cap impart uniform pressure field exhibit clamp-like effect entire surface distal phalanx measure pulsatile volume change . PWA measure continuously three phase : quiet baseline period , 5-minute forearm occlusion , reactive hyperemia follow cuff release . Occlusion brachial artery perform non-dominant upper arm . The continuous monitoring blood volume reach finger tip allow hyperemic response quantify ratio , compare PWA pre post occlusion . A reactive hyperemia index ( RHI ) measure nitric-oxide dependent change vascular tone . The recording non-occluded arm serve control change overall physiological state . The Endo-PAT RHI index define ratio average PWS 1 minute period begin exactly 90 second reactive hyperemia compare average pulse amplitude 210 second pre-occlusion baseline period . Endothelial dysfunction classify RHI &lt; 1.67 average normal endothelial RHI value range 1.7 2.0 . Vitamin D measurement : Blood draw Houston Methodist Hospital laboratory measurement serum 25 ( OH ) D concentration chemiluminescence immunoassay ( Abbott Architect ) . Vitamin D deficiency define serum 25 ( OH ) D level less 20 ng/mL ( 50 nmol/L ) vitamin D insufficiency 21 29 ng/mL ( 50 80 nmol/L ) . Statistical analysis : Descriptive statistic , include mean standard deviation continuous variable frequency percentages categorical variable , calculate study variable .
