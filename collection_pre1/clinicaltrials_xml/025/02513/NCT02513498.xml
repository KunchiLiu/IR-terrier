	<brief_title>Ixazomib Citrate Treating Patients With Chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine proportion subject treatment failure 6 month ixazomib ( ixazomib citrate ) treatment chronic graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine 3 month overall ( complete + partial ) , complete response rate . II . Determine 6 month overall ( complete + partial ) , complete response rate . III . Report overall survival , non-relapse mortality , primary malignancy relapse , failure-free survival , treatment success , discontinuation immune-suppressive therapy 6 month 1 year . IV . Examine functional outcome ( 2-minute walk test ) patient-reported outcome ( Lee Chronic GVHD Symptom Scale , quality life [ Short Form Health Survey ( SF ) -36 , Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy Bone Marrow Transplant ( FACT-BMT ) ] , Human Activity Profile [ HAP ] ) study enrollment , 6 month , 1 year . V. Study biologic effect proteasome inhibition . OUTLINE : Patients receive ixazomib citrate orally ( PO ) weekly day 1 , 8 , 15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 6 month .</detailed_description>
