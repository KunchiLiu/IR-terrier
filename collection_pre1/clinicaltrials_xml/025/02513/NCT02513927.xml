	<detailed_description>Hypertension one common cardiovascular disease , major risk factor stroke cardiovascular event . Traditionally , cardiovascular risk stratification hypertensive patient base average blood pressure ( BP ) measure clinic . Accumulated data show target-organ damage relate 24-h mean intra-arterial BP , also BP variability ( BPV ) subject essential hypertension . Growing evidence demonstrate BPV considerable prognostic value all-cause mortality cardiovascular outcome , independent average BP . The hypertension prevalence high latitude cold region much high low latitude warm region . In China , prevalences hypertension gradually increase South North . Heilongjiang province `` high-risk '' region hypertension , prevalence 30.48 % . This may due combine effect low average temperature high intake salt saturate fatty acid , Increased sympathetic nerve excitability , eventually lead elevation blood pressure . Therefore , essential formulate best treatment hypertension accord physical characteristic northern Chinese . At present , normal range BPV clear . There many study effect different kind drug blood pressure , clinical research impact antihypertensive drug BPV limit , conclusion still controversial .</detailed_description>
