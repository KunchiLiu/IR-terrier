	<brief_summary>This Pharmacokinetic ( PK ) study go provide supplemental PK data support bipolar Phase III study New Drug Application ( NDA ) filing accord regulatory requirement . The primary objective study evaluate PK lamotrigine follow repeat dose lamotrigine dispersible tablet healthy Chinese subject . This study consist Screening Phase ( Days-14 0 ) , Open-label Phase ( Days 1 51 ) follow-up Phase ( 10-17 day last dosing ) . After sign informed consent confirm eligibility , subject start dose lamotrigine 25 mg dispersible tablet daily Day 1 remain dose level two week ( Days 1-14 ) , titrate 50 mg daily Day 15 last week 3-4 ( Days 15-28 ) , titrate 100 mg daily Day 29 week 5-6 ( Days 29-42 ) . The total duration study approximately 10 week include screen follow-up phase .</brief_summary>
