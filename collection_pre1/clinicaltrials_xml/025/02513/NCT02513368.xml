	<brief_summary>The aim present study propose employment Bio-Oss® Bio-Gide® implant site order evaluate increase bucco-lingual bone thickness could enhance stability peri implant soft tissue , compare grafting technique ( bilaminar technique ) , perform association implant placement .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Peri Implant Soft Tissue Healing Single Implant Restoration Using Two Different Techniques</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With respect soft tissue management many surgical approach describe order increase soft tissue volume keratinize tissue height implant site : roll flap , connective tissue graft , epithelial connective tissue graft . In recent year , soft tissue substitute , acellular dermal matrix collagen matrix propose increase dimension peri implant soft tissue ; however , study demonstrate allograft material less effective less predictable autogenous soft tissue graft , term increase attach keratinize tissue , due considerable shrinkage inconsistent quality attach tissue gain ; consequently soft tissue graft palate currently consider gold standard augment peri implant soft . Some clinical study propose association contour augmentation guide bone regeneration ( GBR ) implant placement . The aim procedures restore miss volume establish facial bone wall sufficient height thickness serve support peri implant soft tissue ; term , GBR could consider important increase stability peri implant soft tissue , prevent marginal soft tissue shrinkage follow exposition implant . This could valid approach stabilize coronal peri implant soft tissue time less traumatic grafting procedure .</detailed_description>
