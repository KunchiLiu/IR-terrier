	<brief_summary>In today 's society , search keep appearance visible sign age become common . Therefore , many therapy try mitigate senility marker present specialized clinic . Such therapy seek ground theory skin appendage respond age process , cause way , create way slow minimize wrinkle consequence natural biological process . However , process accelerate exposure ultraviolet light toxic substance well tobacco , among others . The low-power laser light emit diode ( LED ) characterize non-ablative light source , mean phototherapy cause physical damage epidermis , case CO2 laser ablative method . This study purpose compare effect combine application low level laser LED LED action alone facial rejuvenation . For , analysis effect conduct digital photography , blind assessment customer satisfaction questionnaire .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Application LED Therapy Laser Therapy Facial Rejuvenation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot study see lack study subject choose sample calculation accurately define . This do 32 volunteer , respect criterion inclusion exclusion previously cite read signing Informed Consent Clarified . The sample comprise total 30 subject , divide randomly two group 16 subject . The first group make use technique combine study : Infrared Laser Led Amber . The second group , turn , use Led Amber.These allocate randomly intervention simple blind.They hold 10 session individual application , group 1 ( Laser LED ) group 2 ( LED ) application two group occur per week . Group 1 make application two technique day session . Both apply follow area face : chin / perioral , nasolabial fold , periorbital , frontal glabellar region . Both group act control start session , ensure change observe skin cause treatment fact environment . For , volunteer accompany first month , completion photograph begin month another month-end , well questionnaire end 30 day . To monitor result , hold 4 shoot subject study . The first session take place first meeting patient , undergo 4-week follow-up without use methodology . After four week , new shoot hold determine whether environment able promote change skin patient . After , start bare-sessions . After five session treatment , new picture monitoring hold , repeat procedure end treatment yes , compare image get search result . To carry photo , standard procedure order maintain quality , angle light always , result observe truthful fact . Initially , face patient clean , particularly aim removal cosmetic excess oil surface photograph . This precede photographic record least 5 minute friction mark flush fall apart . Afterwards , patient prisoner hair ( use burrow ) , photograph stand front lateral plane ( side ) , parallel plane camera sensor . To well guide , applied floor mark position foot , followed.A camera mount tripod , level horizontal position , 105mm lens place proper height frame mouth , forehead brow . The framework area follow alignment facial landmark camera 's viewfinder grid live view mode . To photograph brow area iris align intersection line divide room low horizontal line divide extreme vertical side room grid . To shoot mouth area `` Cheilion '' two point align respectively intersection line bisect grid line divide extreme horizontal side room . To photograph area forehead ( side ) `` Exocanthion '' `` Otobasion Superious '' point align intersection line bisect grid line divide extreme horizontal side room . The flash mount hot shoe camera , set TTL mode drive diffuser head direct forward . The camera display manual mode , f5.6 aperture , shutter speed 1/60 second 200 ISO . At end collection collation , registration randomization obtain photograph , evaluation research student , receive photo random order put expect development order rejuvenation treatment . After learn correct order , quantify improvement fine line four area choose analysis . In addition , two blind evaluator invite participate project analyze way researcher student . The external evaluator one knowledge method person expose . The evaluator know whether placebo group study . Still , important consider designate evaluator person extensive knowledge skin possible treatment , see exactly improvement skin participant . The analysis photo take place three step : STEP 1 : Slides 3 4 photograph subject random order ( black white photograph color hair , earring , interfere result ) . The evaluator classify image order 1-4 , 1 bad picture , 4 best ( relative expression line , skin texture brightness ) ( expect treatment leave skin well , sort order ) . They receive 4 slide pertain subject , contain picture respective region assess : frontal , nasolabial , periorbital , glabellar . Along , evaluator deliver table put sort order 1-4 present slide . STEP 2 : Slide picture start treatment final photograph arrange chronologically ( photographs black white ) . The assessor note first last picture region treat patient ( 4 region per patient ) classify change one degree scale : 0 % = change regard improvement fine line / wrinkle . 1 % - 25 % = little change regard improvement fine line / wrinkle , difficult observe 25-50 % = change regard improvement fine line / wrinkle , nothing extremely significant 50 % = change relation improvement fine line / wrinkle visible , skin really improve considerably STEP 3 : Slides contain two image patient central area face ( Vintage Photography ) . The evaluator receive slide contain photograph start treatment last shot volunteer perform relate face central region . It evaluator understand follow item : 1 . Voluntary skin spot ? Yes ? 2 . If stain show difference amount ( uniformity ) skin treatment ? Yes ? In addition , throughout study customer satisfaction questionnaire carry order monitor whether patient enjoy treatment , believe actually run ( sort qualitivamente improvement fine line ) recommend people.Thus , treatment becomes , general , valuable , since know market , transmission one person another feature procedures result efficient form disclosure . Such test do middle treatment ( 5 session ) end ( 10 session ) compare whether change view meantime .</detailed_description>
