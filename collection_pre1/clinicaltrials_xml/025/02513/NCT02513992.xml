	<brief_summary>Ictal SPECT intravenous injection cubital vein perfusion tracer establish technique localize ictal onset zone presurgical evaluation refractory focal epilepsy . When seizure last less 10 second , localize information often obtain . Since take around 30 second tracer reach brain intravenous injection , ictal hyperperfusion likely already switch postictal hypoperfusion . In study , plan inject perfusion tracer aorta proximal cerebral artery , allow true ictal injection patient seizures short duration .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ictal SPECT With Intra-arterial Injection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study , investigator select one patient refractory focal epilepsy frequent seizure short duration , localize early ictal SPECT intravenous injection cubital vein . An arterial catheter insert . The right groin disinfect use alcoholic disinfectant locally anaesthetize . The artery groin , femoral artery , puncture . A catheter insert artery slided towards heart . To determine correct position catheter proximal cerebral artery , contrast agent inject , time radiograph take . The catheter attach taped groin . The patient monitor video-EEG recording . During epileptic seizure , perfusion tracer 99m-Technetium Ethyl Cysteinate Dimer ( 99mTc- ECD ) dissolve 30 cc normal saline inject pressure injector 2 second . After injection , catheter remove ictal SPECT scan perform . Subtracted ictal SPECT image co-registered MRI ( SISCOM ) obtain . The investigator plan study one patient order ass whether procedure logistically possible determine whether subtraction image ictal SPECT intra-arterial injection minus interictal SPECT intravenous injection allow localization ictal onset zone .</detailed_description>
