	<brief_title>Study Evaluate Efficacy Safety Eribulin Mesylate Combination With Pembrolizumab Subjects With Metastatic Triple-Negative Breast Cancer ( mTNBC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Phase 1b part evaluate safety tolerability eribulin mesylate combination pembrolizumab . Approximately 6 participant may enrol Phase 1b part study . The Phase 2 part evaluate tumor objective response treat eribulin mesylate combination pembrolizumab participant mTNBC previously treat 0 2 line systemic anticancer therapy ( cytotoxic target anticancer agent ) metastatic setting . Approximately 106 mTNBC participant ( include participant Phase 1b RP2D level ) enrol Phase 2 .</detailed_description>
