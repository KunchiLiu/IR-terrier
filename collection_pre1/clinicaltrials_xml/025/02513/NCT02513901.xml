	<brief_summary>HIV replication effectively suppress acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) prevent highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) . However , HIV-infected people must remain treatment continuously avoid viral rebound progression AIDS . HIV persistence think stem primarily presence integrated copy proviral genome within long-lived cell . Because active viral gene expression cause cell death due viral cytopathic effect immune response , long-lived cell likely harbor transcriptionally silent , latent provirus . HIV-1 persistence long-lived cellular reservoir remain major barrier cure . HDACi potential activate ( `` Kick '' ) latently infect cell . This make HIV infect cell visible immune system ; immune response antiretrovirals ( ARVs ) able attack eliminate ( `` Kill '' ) infect cell . The purpose study evaluate safety efficacy multi-dose Chidamide combination antiretroviral therapy HIV-infected adult suppress viral load .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chidamide Combination With Antiretroviral Therapy Eradication Latent HIV-1 Reservoir</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Every participant receive oral Chidamide Day 0 , 3 , 7 , 10 , 14 , 17 , 21 , 24 . In Step 1 , dose Chidamide 10 mg time , Step 2 30 mg time . Participants enrol Step 1 first ; dose give Step 1 well tolerated safety concern note , Step 2 enrol . All participant keep antiretroviral therapy study . Each step study last 56 day , involve 14 study visit ( Screening , Day 0 , 2 , 3 , 8 , 11 , 14 , 15 , 17 , 21 , 24 , 26 , 27 , 56 ) every participant . At screen visit , participant give medical history undergo physical exam ; blood sample collect . Participants undergo pharmacokinetic ( PK ) sample require blood drawn 0 , 1 , 2 , 6 , 12 , 24 , 48 , 72h first dose . For multi-dose PK study , blood sample collect time point last dose . Participants undergo pharmacodynamic ( PD ) sample require blood drawn 0 , 6 , 12 , 24 , 48 , 72h first dose . For steady-state concentration PK PD study , blood sample collect 5-30 minute Chidamide administration Day 14 , 17 , 21 . If participant agree , blood sample may store future research .</detailed_description>
