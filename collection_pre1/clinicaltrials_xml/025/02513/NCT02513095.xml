	<detailed_description>The study take place emergency medical facility . Due life-threatening nature exertional heat stroke ( EHS ) , rapid assessment inclusion study subsequent immediate treatment must occur . Following initial triage primary assessment subject , subject 's baseline status document , diagnosis EHS obtain , SOC treatment initiate immediately , subject randomize one two treatment arm ( SOC SOC plus Ryanodex ) . Patients remain hospitalized 72 hour administration first dose study drug implement SOC receive necessary supportive measure resolution symptom . Study duration : 72 hour</detailed_description>
