	<criteria>Patient inform consent require registration PMS . In case patient informed consent ( provide type information ) require PMS per participate site policy , Sponsor cooperate need . If know time index procedure patient able return 8month followup visit angiogram 1year clinical followup , patient register PMS . Patients treat ( stent delivery system insert body ) XIENCE PRIME SV register ( include provisional stenting side branch treatment exclude bailout use ) . The observation compile perpatient basis even multiple stent implant index procedure . A patient whose sidebranch treat XIENCE PRIME SV register . In case , main vessel treat XIENCE PRIME . A patient treat drug elute stent ( DES ) plan stent XIENCE PRIME SV bailout purpose register . Additional revascularization procedure part adverse event treatment plan stag procedure consider another registration , adverse event . A patient treat , fail implanted XIENCE PRIME SV finally treat device ( No XIENCE PRIME SV implant ) must also register . In case , stent information , device deficiency information reportable adverse event related PRIME stent , , require capture . Followup patient receive XIENCE PRIME SV stent require . A patient may another lesion ( ) may treat large diameter stent ( ) . In case , treatment XIENCE PRIME preferable . Lesion ( ) treat XIENCE PRIME consider target lesion .</criteria>
