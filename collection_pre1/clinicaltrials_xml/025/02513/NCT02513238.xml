	<brief_summary>The current study aim ass safety feasibility injection autologous adipost tissue derive MSCs radiation-induced salivary gland hypofunction xerostomia head neck cancer participant . The project potentially help develop clinically relevant treatment option grow number patient suffer xerostomia radiotherapy . The development new therapy especially important , since sub-optimal symptomatic treatment currently available symptom xerostomia greatly reduce quality life .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Design Randomized , control trial blinding . To maintain allocation concealment participant , care giver , trial investigator outcome assessor except Blood Bank staff blind intervention . Staff Blood Bank direct contact patient ( hereafter participant ) . Project plan For inclusion study participant usual medical history take accord guideline Ear , Nose Throat Surgical Department , Copenhagen University Hospital Rigshospitalet . All participant undergo mini lip-suction , MSCs ex vivo expand good manufacturing practice ( GMP ) -approved clean room facility ( The Blood Bank , section 2014 ) . When cell arrive Blood Bank , participant randomize either ex vivo expansion mesenchymal stem cell freeze potential later use . Expected ex vivo expansion phase 3-4 week . The purification isolation base protocol previously approve clinical use . Amount MSCs require injection Based publish animal study amount give xerostomia mouse varies 2 x 105 2 x 106 [ 19 ] . To convert mouse data realistic dose human extrapolate base follow data : The volume density submandibular gland closely approximate 1 ( 1.06-1.07 mg/mm3 ) [ 27 ] . In mice study radiotherapy mean gland weight approximately 350mg , corresponds approximate volume 350mm3 . Therefore mouse dose pr . gland volume approximately 286.000-2.860.000cells pr . cm3 gland ( calculate either 1 x 105 1 x 106 ) . The volume submandibular gland human subject radiotherapy 6.6-7.9cm3 [ 28 ] . This correspond approximate dose pr . patient 1.9 x 106 2.2 x 106 , 1.9 x 107 2.2 x 107 cell pr . submandibular gland . From assumption order give cell choose proceed maximum dose correspond 2.8*10^6 MSC/cm^3 gland , i.e . maximum total dose per patient approximately 4,6 * 10^7 MSCs . However standardize dose give patient , amount give standardized size submandibular gland , describe . Injection MSCs submandibular gland Subjects go ENT-department , section 2073 inpatient procedure . The surgical procedure do local anaesthesia use ultrasonic guidance sterile technique . After receive MSC-suspension placebo-suspension , surgeon identify submandibular gland inject suspension MSCs . Calculation inject number MSCs pr . participant rest follow calculation : , volume volume submandibular gland , gland-volume app . 7-8cm3 norm . Therefore amount cell give participant app . total . Afterwards participant give band-aid counter analgesic . The MSCs suspend Isotonic NaCl ( 0,9 mg/ml ) Human Albumin ( HA ) 1 % final volume 2ml . Placebo 2ml Isotonic NaCl ( 0,9mg/ml ) HA 1 % . Follow-up MRI recipient place perform 3-4 week 3-4 month postoperatively . MRI use volume determination salivary gland control recipient place . After 3-4 month , small biopsy randomly take one two salivary gland . The procedure take place local anaesthesia . Histology determine ( sample blind pathologist ) . When final MRI , biopsy salivary function test perform approx . 3-4 month treatment specific study related test activity conclude . To detect late complication late adverse event study participant receive MSC-treatment invited check-up 1 year 3 year treatment . Safety , isolation propagation MSC The Blood Bank cell-tissue approval Danish Health Medicines Authority ( accord Danish Tissue Law ) , well Manufacturer's/Importer 's Authorisation regard Human Medicinal Products , necessary physical facility , personnel operational resource produce MSCs accordance good manufacturing practice ( GMP ) . The MSC product test recognized surface marker ( CD73 , CD90 , CD105 , ) use flow cytometry , undergo general quality check final release ( cell viability test microorganisms ) . With regard cultivation MSC use basal medium supplement human platelet lysate healthy blood donor instead former use animal-derived serum ( fetal bovine serum , FBS ) . This following benefit : 1 ) No likelihood transfection know unknown animal pathogen , risk xeno-immunization 2 ) Small batch-to-batch variation thus consistent growth performance , since group prepare approx . 50 healthy donor . All harvest , isolation , expansion , etc . MSC accordance GMP regulation . The Blood Bank clean room facility approve Danish Health Medicines Authority GMP compliant cell expansion clinical use , study carry specially trained personnel . Assessment xerostomia subjective treatment outcome The subjective effect treatment assess 100 mm visual analogue scale xerostomia fill patient [ 31 ] physician-rated questionnaire [ 32 ] , carry well treatment . Each participant also ask daily symptom dry mouth accord UKU side-effect rating scale item 3.3 [ 29 ] . This scale include four score 0 denotes feel dry mouth , 1 denotes slight feel dry mouth , 2 denotes severe feel dry mouth , 3 denotes troublesome feeling dry mouth make speech eat difficult . Assessment salivary flow rate objective treatment outcome Changes secretion rate unstimulated whole saliva oral cavity probably important parameter biological development xerostomia accompany pathological oral condition . Whole saliva , e.g. , mixed secretion major minor salivary gland mixed oral cavity . A correct determination value crucial assessment treatment outcome project . For assessment saliva flow rate , whole saliva collect 9 12 a.m . Subjects refrain eating , drinking , smoke oral hygiene 2 hr collection . After seated upright chair , relax 5 min instruct make movement possible , include swallowing , collection . Before treatment unstimulated whole saliva collect use spit method [ 33 ] participant spit saliva collection container period 15 minute . The salivary flow rate ( SFR ) ( ml / min ) determine increase weight container divide collection time minute . After collection unstimulated saliva , subject instruct chew 1 g sterile paraffin wax . They ask keep mouth close chew avoid swallowing . Every 60 sec ask spit new saliva collector start new chew period . This repeat 5 min . To assess treatment outcome submandibular gland , saliva also collect directly floor mouth unstimulated stimulated state . The unstimulated whole saliva flow rate submandibular gland assess swab method cotton roll place buccally maxillary molar region tongue floor mouth . Immediately prior start collection ask swallow , case possible saliva extract pipette . Collection take place two subsequent period 3 min , end period , chin lip wipe napkin . Saliva flow rate determine weight ( 1 g equal 1 ml saliva ) roll napkin weigh collection reweighed . The flow rate calculate increment weight collection express millilitre per minute . Saliva cotton roll extract centrifugation ( 1500g ) analyze composition . This stimulated collection process perform afterwards citrus-containing roll stimulate submandibular gland maximally . From collection saliva , saliva aliquoted stored -800C . Chemical analysis saliva Whole saliva contain large number bacteria epithelial cell , well gingival crevicular fluid . Therefore , whole saliva normally suit analysis sensitive chemical parameter . For purpose , selectively collect saliva individual gland much well . As result , majority analyze perform either parotid submandibular gland / sublingualis saliva . The following analyzes perform collected saliva : pH bicarbonate ionic balance estimation [ 34 ] , sodium , potassium , calcium , phosphate , chloride fluoride [ 35 ] , total protein select protein [ 36 ] amylase [ 37 ] . The purpose study evaluate whether saliva normalized treatment , thus provide estimate saliva dental mucosal protective capacity treatment . Data collection analysis Source data : There source documentation data Case Report Form ( CRF ) . The study director allow direct access study data study document monitoring , audit inspection Science Ethics Committee , Danish Health Medicines Authority similar authority country . Permission seek DPA process personal data Danish Data Protection Act . Applications send via legal secretariat , Rigshospitalet .</detailed_description>
