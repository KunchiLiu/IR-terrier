	<brief_summary>An angiotensin II type 2 receptor ( AT2R ) antagonist assess efficacy neuropathic pain promising result . A considerable number patient undergo surgery general anesthesia hypertensive receive drug control high blood pressure , include angiotensin II receptor antagonist . These drug may attenuate acute and/or chronic postoperative pain decrease analgesic requirement surgery . The aim present study assess early postoperative pain analgesic requirement patient treated antagonist angiotensin II receptor least three month surgery compare normotensive patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients ASA I-III , age 35 79 year old , BMI ≤ 35 , schedule abdominal surgery , thus gynecological , urological general surgery procedure recruit study . All patient schedule morning list , inform study ask give write informed consent . Exclusion Criteria patient analgesic , antidepressive , sedative consumption previous one month , mental impairment , speak Greek refuse give write informed consent , diabetic , patient receive antihypertensive treatment angiotensin type II receptor ( AT2R ) antagonists . Two group patient stydied : Patients hypertensive ( hypertensive group ) receive treatment blood pressure control angiotensin II receptor antagonist least three month preoperatively normotensive group . Measurements - Pain intensity ( visual analogue scale : VAS ) 0 100 report 2 , 4 , 8 , 24 hour postoperatively 0 represent pain 100 excruciate bad pain . Pain record rest subsequently patient ask cough three time . - Analgesics consume time point record . - Patient satisfaction ( VAS 0-100 ) 24 h postoperatively ( special reference pain ) - Three month postoperatively patient contact phone ask experience pain related surgery . If yes pain characteristic , thus burning , prick etc . record . - Three month postoperatively patient ask whether use analgesic discharge hospital postoperative pain . Statistics Primary outcome study : Pain intensity 24 hour postoperatively cough patient receive angiotensin II receptor antagonist , antihypertensive therapy . Secondary outcome study pain intensity 2 , 4 , 8 24 hour postoperatively rest , 2 , 4 8 hour cough , analgesic consumption , 2 , 4 , 8 24 hour postoperatively , patient satisfaction regard pain , presence pain three month surgery present characteristic . Also , analgesic consumption first three month postoperatively due surgery . Statistics Power analysis : A 30 % difference pain intensity cough 24 hour postoperatively angiotensin II receptor antagonist treat group compare treat group . Acute pain rest cough time point define study design compare patient receive antihypertensive treatment ( angiotensin II receptor antagonist ) control . Cumulative analgesic consume 2 , 4 , 8 24 hour surgery compare two group . The presence chronic postsurgical pain need analgesic intake due chronic pain three month surgery also compare hypertensive treat normotensive patient . Parametric non-parametric test use normal normal distribution respectively .</detailed_description>
