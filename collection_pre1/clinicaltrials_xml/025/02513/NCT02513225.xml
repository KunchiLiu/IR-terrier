	<brief_summary>The goal research study evaluate impact paraprofessional-delivered , culturally adapt , evidence-based intervention ( EBI ) sexually transmit disease ( STD ) , substance use poor mental/emotional health among American Indians ( AI ) Randomized Controlled Trial ( RCT ) . These intertwine risk produce marked disparity unique cultural social determinant Native community . If aim achieve , scientific knowledge community-based practice advance area vital AI community , STD drug prevention science . Prior study , investigator apply finding research protocol ( IRB # 00005929 ) adapt brief intervention reduce risk increase protective behavior STDs , HIV/AIDS , substance use poor mental/emotional health , promote STD screening . The specific aim current study compare efficacy adapt brief intervention vs. comparison condition participant ' condom use , STD screen treatment-seeking behavior , substance use emotional/mental health outcome 3 6 month post-intervention .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Adapted STD Screening Risk Reduction Intervention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>STDs include Neisseria gonorrhea , Chlamydia trachomatis Trichomonas vaginalis , urgent problem American Indian/Alaska Native ( AI/AN ) community due constellation risk contextual factor affect tribal population . Geographic isolation cultural social stigmatization contribute poor access screening , counsel education , diminish opportunity early identification STDs . Evidence-based prevention , STD screen early identification best public health strategy address potential epidemic among AI/ANs . However , currently paucity strategy demonstrate AI/AN population . An intervention target STD screening relate risk reduction behavior potential circumvent continuous transference disease . Participating Community : The Fort Apache Reservation home ~17,000 White Mountain Apache tribal member , almost half &lt; 20 year age . The reservation encompass 1.7 million acre along northeastern Arizona . The Tribe endure notable demographic environmental challenge impact behavioral risk among community member : 61 % population &gt; 16 year old either `` Not Labor Force '' unemployed . 47 % Apaches age â‰¥25 receive high school diploma . The median household income $ 26,973 47 % population live federal poverty line . Over half ( 53 % ) ( 1 ) Apache household lead single mother ; ( 2 ) 75 % child bear unwed mother . ( 3 ) These factor contribute high rate school drop-out , substance use , high-risk sexual behavior poor mental emotional health void effective intervention . Despite challenge , Apache community successfully demonstrate ability adapt implement effective paraprofessional-administered intervention . ( 4,5 ) Epidemiology STD Related Risk Behaviors : Recently , STD rate increase throughout Arizona , state 's AI population bear disproportionately high burden new infection . ( 6 ) In 2011 , chlamydia rate among AIs Arizona 6 time rate non-Hispanic Whites . ( 6 ) The rate gonorrhea among AIs Arizona triple 2009 2011 , rise largely attribute `` outbreaks tribal area northeastern quadrant Arizona . `` ( 6 ) In 2011-2012 , chlamydia rate among Apaches 2,116/100,000 age , nearly 5 time Arizona national all-ages rate . The Apache gonorrhea rate 749/100,000 age 2011-2012 , approximately 7 10 time higher national Arizona all-ages rate , respectively . Previous study indicate among race ethnicity AI/ANs high rate inconsistent condom use , multiple sex partner early sexual initiation . ( 7-10 ) The intersection several behavioral risk poor mental health , drug use binge alcohol use show increase STD risk behavior . A study conduct Apache teen recent suicidal behavior reveal high rate lifetime drug use : 92 % alcohol , 88 % marijuana , 38 % crack/cocaine , 35 % methamphetamine , 3 time AI/AN adolescent 2009 . Highlighting intersection risk , 48 % sexually active ever use cocaine compare 17 % sexually active ; similarly , 40 % sexually active participant ever use methamphetamine compare 17 % participant sexually active . There scarce rigorous RCTs behavioral health intervention among AI population none analyze EBI promote STD screen address interrelated risk substance use , poor emotional health STDs/ HIV/AIDS . This study target share root cause substance use sexual risk behavior aim develop personalized , strengths-based risk reduction strategy tailor participant ' community 's specific risk profile .</detailed_description>
