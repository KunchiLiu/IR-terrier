	<brief_title>Antiproteinuric Effects Liraglutide Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Initial finding point clinically significant antiproteinuric effect liraglutide treatment , possibly independent blood pressure reduction . The mechanism behind unclear magnitude albuminuria reduction need verify . Antiproteinuric effect usually renoprotective potentially also cardioprotective may suggest additional benefit liraglutide treatment . The aim study evaluate magnitude antiproteinuric effect short-term liraglutide treatment ( 12 week ) patient type 2 diabetes albuminuria . In addition , possible mechanism cause antiproteinuric effect explore .</detailed_description>
