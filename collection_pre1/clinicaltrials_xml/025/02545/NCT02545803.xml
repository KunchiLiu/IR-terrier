	<brief_summary>Hypoxemia commonly report patient admit Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) may result acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ALI/ARDS ) , sepsis , trauma postoperative complication . In attempt preserve increase oxygenation , conventional mechanical ventilation initiate patient . Unfortunately , patient frequently become refractory standard ventilatory technique , gas exchange remain unaltered becomes worse . High Frequency Percussive Ventilation ( HFPV ) , hand , advance mode ventilation salvage option patient cohort already proven improve gas exchange success . The volumetric diffusive respirator ( VDR-4 ; Percussionary , Corp. , Sandpoint , ID ) commercially available system deliver HFPV . This ventilator mechanically ventilate lung administer small successive subtidal volume percussion unconventional high frequency reach optimal diffusive oxygenation . Since know hypoxemia due reduce oxygenation result secondary brain injury , conceivable cerebral tissue oxygenation might impair well . It strongly suggest cerebral tissue oxygenation optimal range ameliorative influence hypoxic event turn lead well clinical outcome . Thus far , study conduct investigate improve oxygenation mean switch HFPV automatically lead increment cerebral tissue oxygenation . With use Near-Infrared Spectroscopy ( NIRS ) technology , investigator investigate whether alternation ventilation strategy associate ( beneficial ) change cerebral tissue oxygenation .</brief_summary>
