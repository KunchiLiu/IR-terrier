	<brief_title>Development Validation Novel MRI Methods Detection Prostate Cancer Aggressiveness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prostate cancer one common neoplastic disease men . Prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) limit role diagnosis characterization prostate cancer . The diagnosis prostate cancer still commonly do transrectal ultrasonography ( TRUS ) guide biopsy . However , TRUS guide biopsy carry risk increase complication . There increase interest develop accurate non-invasive imaging modality could potentially detect prostate cancer aggressiveness . Diffusion weight imaging ( DWI ) rotate frame relaxation measurement show particularly promising prostate cancer detection characterization . This study focus development validation DWI rotate frame relaxation measurement enroll 200 men histologically diagnosed prostate cancer undergo magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) prostatectomy . Anatomical MRI novel acquisition method focus DWI rotate frame relaxation measurement perform use surface coil non-invasively detect characterize prostate cancer .</detailed_description>
