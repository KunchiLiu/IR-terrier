	<brief_summary>During orthodontic treatment bacterial plaque readily accumulate teeth . This food easily accumulate around brace difficult clean brace place . The plaque accumulation lead demineralisation ( white spot ) develop teeth . This start decay lead permanent mark filling required.Prior start orthodontic treatment adequate oral hygiene necessary . During orthodontic treatment , important patient excellent level oral hygiene prevent plaque accumulate demineralisation occur . However , adequate tooth brush difficult perform bacterial plaque easily visible . Thus patient may able see area need good tooth brushing . QLFD ( Quantitative Light Induced Fluorescence Digital ) noninvasive method us fluorescent light illuminate oral bacteria plaque responsible demineralisation . The purpose study use QLFD camera ass ability measure plaque accumulation demineralisation start orthodontic treatment . The study also assess QLFD camera tool improve oral hygiene .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Plaque contribute factor development dental disease include tooth decay gum disease . Thus , excellent standard oral hygiene require ensure plaque remove teeth reduce risk develop disease . Plaque accumulation start great plaque stagnation site , tend gum margin . In orthodontic treatment , bracket archwires significant plaque stagnation sites.Conventional tooth brushing also difficult compound increased plaque accumulation retention . It important patient learn recognize presence plaque ensure optimal level oral hygiene achieve . Frequently patient difficulty localize deposit enable optimal level oral hygiene . Demineralisation occur due bacterial fermentation dietary sugar , produce acid . This lead white mark develop tooth surface , first stage dental caries . The risk demineralisation increase orthodontic treatment , tend great plaque accumulation . Previous study report prevalence rate demineralisation orthodontic treatment high 96 % . The visible front surface teeth often severely affected detrimental impact appearance . Early demineralisation reversible plaque control improve , however progress cavity may develop require restoration . The main form management demineralisation prevention . This mainly excellent level oral hygiene diet limit number sugar intake . During orthodontics , patient frequently find difficult detect plaque around brace , thus oral hygiene often adequate . This lead great plaque accumulation increase risk develop demineralisation . The QLFD Biluminator noninvasive novel device , base previous QLF technology . In vitro vivo study former QLF device demonstrate appropriate identifying demineralisation longitudinal monitoring mineral change orthodontics . The advantage new QLFD device take white light image addition QLF image . Having two image , take nearly simultaneously , allow comparison make ensures consistency regard magnification angulation . From image , plaque accumulation demineralisation measure . In addition , demineralisation detect QLF image evident white light image , great benefit clinician detect risk patient . This study aim assess plaque accumulation demineralisation use new QLFD device start orthodontic treatment . It also assess use oral hygiene evaluation tool improve patient tooth brush inadequate oral hygiene start orthodontic treatment . White light QLF image take QLFD device patient give focused oral hygiene advice base image .</detailed_description>
