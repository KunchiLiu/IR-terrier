	<brief_title>Quantification Side Effects During Hepatitis C Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatitis C Virus infection one main cause chronic liver disease worldwide current estimate approximately 130 - 210 million individual ( accord 3 % world population ) chronically infect hepatitis C virus . However , hepatitis C virus infection among common cause lead chronic hepatitis , liver cirrhosis liver relate death worldwide . The current standard care combination pegylated Interferon Ribavirin ( dual-therapy ) . Since 2011 , direct-acting antiviral drug inhibit viral protease approve addition standard therapy ( triple-therapy ) . The occurrence adverse event well severity generally depend therapy regimen influence type dosage medication . Most common adverse event ( affect 95 % patient ) fever , fatigue , headache , nausea , arthralgia , depression , skin reaction , neutropenia , anemia . A frequent occurrence adverse event triple-therapy compare dual- therapy become clear since 's introduction , particularly regard anemia , neutropenia , gastrointestinal discomfort , fatigue , dysgeusia , skin reaction . How- ever , accumulate evidence often appearance infection and/or infestation patient receive triple-therapy . The medical consequence adverse event reduction quality life consecutively loss antiviral therapy adherence . Thus , early recognition immediate treatment adverse event crucial aspect success antiviral treatment . Aim study quantify report adverse event respect therapy reg- imen ( dual-therapy vs. triple-therapy ) patient treat Department Internal Medicine , Division Gastroenterology Hepatology Medical University Graz . Furthermore , detail review international treatment recommendation , well analysis possible predictor parameter appearance adverse event treatment success do .</detailed_description>
