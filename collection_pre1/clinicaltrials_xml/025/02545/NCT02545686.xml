	<brief_title>Effect CPAP Breath Hold Chest Movement Normal Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CPAP non-invasive ventilation technique commonly use treat sleep apnea . Using small air-pump , tube facemask , provide constant stream pressurize air upper airways lung . Some physiological effect note CPAP hyperinflation lung , stabilize flatten diaphragm , decrease tidal volume . The effect duration breath hold unknown . During radiation treatment , effect expect reduce tumor organ motion reduces volume normal tissue irradiate also create favorable treatment geometry move heart away anterior chest wall . An important advantage CPAP compare technique active patient cooperation require . The potential exists combine use CPAP respiratory management technique breath hold improve overall effectiveness . When used sleep apnea well tolerated pose little risk patient . There publish report use CPAP radiation therapy . In initial study Varian RPM system use assess respiratory motion without CPAP patient receive radiation therapy . This commercially available , non-invasive system work direct infrared beam onto infrared motion detector place patient ' upper abdomen . The detector record change abdomen position occurs respiration change amplitude detector position . Interventions effect respiration record increase decrease amplitude detector motion . When use breath hold , detector remain fixed position narrow gate window . Based initial experience RPM system , find approximately 1 hour CPAP use require reduce diaphragm motion . Although early result favorable use approach , certain best efficient method use patient . The use CPAP combine breath hold technique study . The objective study use RPM system normal volunteer : 1 . Study effect CPAP diaphragm motion allow good optimization use CPAP respiratory management technique free breathing . 2 . Determine feasibility use CPAP respiratory aid use patient treat breath hold technique . Determine effect CPAP duration ; reproducibility tolerance breath hold technique .</detailed_description>
