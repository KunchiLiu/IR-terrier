	<brief_summary>It great importance obtain optimal surgical condition surgeon order increase patient safety . The effect different intervention surgical condition assess various surgeon-assessed rating scale . A 5-point surgical rating scale previously test proof-of-concept trial - validate - radical retropubic prostatectomy ask different surgeon evaluate surgical workspace use video sequence . In ongoing study ( The Hernia Study , Trial registration NCT02247466 ) perform investigator group , investigator use 5-point scale rate surgical workspace laparoscopic ventral herniotomy without neuromuscular blockade . This scale base previously use scale already publish study description connect point . To author ' knowledge scale never validate laparoscopic setting , intra-abdominal pressure pneumoperitoneum great influence visualization . In fact , investigator knowledge , validate surgeon-assessed rating scale regard surgical workspace laparoscopic surgery exist . Purpose : Primary aim : To validate 5-point rating scale investigate inter-rater agreement evaluation surgical workspace different intra-abdominal pressure . Using intra-abdominal video recording . Secondary aim : To validate 10-point rating scale investigate inter-rater agreement evaluation surgical workspace different intra-abdominal pressure . To test agreement two rating scale . To assess two rating scale high inter-rater agreement To assess intra-rater agreement rating scale . Hypothesis : Investigators hypothesize 5-point rating scale intra-class correlation coefficient ( ICC ) &gt; 0.6. , validate video-sequences obtain laparoscopic surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Validation Subjective Rating Scale Assessment Surgical Workspace Laparoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Scales : The 5-point scale use assess surgical workspace laparoscopic herniotomy : 1 . ( Extremely poor condition ) Unable complete surgery without interventions* 2 . ( Poor condition ) Several minor adjustment need complete surgery . ( ie . change patient positioning , surgeon position ) 3 . ( Acceptable condition ) After minor adjustment surgery complete . 4 . ( Good condition ) Surgical workspace good , interference , need adjustment . 5 . ( Optimal condition ) Surgical workspace optimal procedure complete without interference . - Interventions define change depth neuromuscular blockade and/or pneumoperitoneum . The 10-point scale use assess surgical workspace laparoscopic herniotomy Visual Analog Scale , surgeon specify rating surgical workspace indicate position along continuous line two end-points Video recording : Elective laparoscopic inguinal hernia procedure use make video-recordings different level pneumoperitoneum desufflation surgery complete . Each video-sequence last 20-30 second . three video-sequences different level pneumoperitoneum make patient . The patient randomize one three group regard level pneumoperitoneum three video-recordings . Group 1 : 12-9-6 mmHg , 2 : 11-8-5 , 3 : 10-7-4 mmHg . Three video-sequences different level pneumoperitoneum ( accord group allocation ) make patient . We record 5 pilot video-sequences evaluate two experienced surgeon order design standard setup film surgical workspace . From 30 record video-sequences investigator choose 24 video-sequences best illustrate different level surgical workspace . The video-sequences embed internet form , sequence follow question rating particular surgical workspace . Each surgeon present 24 sequence randomly select recording different patient . After record surgeon evaluate surgical work space one two rating scale . After rating recording , use one scale , recording repeat random order second scale use . When assessment surgeon imagine he/she laparoscopic inguinal herniotomy , evaluation/rating base situation . The surgeon allow discuss rating study . To observe intra-rater agreement surgeon ass sequence least twice use rating scale . Therefore surgeon see recording four time study . Sample size requirement calculate estimate width confidence interval ( CI ) describe Shoukri et . An ICC 0.8 95 % CI [ 0.6-1.0 ] achieve 8 surgeon assess 24 recording . To ensure sufficient variation recording investigator include total 10 patient make three recording . Sample size requirement calculate estimate width confidence interval ( CI ) describe Shoukri et . An ICC 0.8 95 % CI [ 0.6-1.0 ] achieve 8 surgeon assess 24 recording . To ensure sufficient variation recording include total 10 patient make three recording . Investigators assume 24 recording see 24 independent subject . Both inter-rater agreement intra-rater agreement calculate use Kappa intraclass correlation statistic . statistical software6 . The model ICC two-way random , single measure , absolute agreement , ( ICC ( 2,1 ) ) Calculated use SPSS ( ver 22.0 ) . The agreement two rating scale test regression analysis use Spearman correlation coefficient . To assess two rating scale high inter-rater agreement two scale correspond ICC confidence interval compare . Investigator co-authors responsible analyze study data assistance Statistician locate Herlev Hospital . Investigators include 8 surgeon ( Specialist level training proficient laparoscopic inguinal surgery ) .</detailed_description>
