	<brief_summary>After acute brain injury , primary pathophysiological response arises , enable brain develop seizures and/or status epilepticus ( SE ) . These frequently report patient admit intensive care unit ( ICU ) traumatic brain injury brain injury cause subarachnoid intracerebral hemorrhage . Seizures present without clinical motor sign , term nonconvulsive , therefore remain frequently clinically unrecognized . As , great importance patient diagnose early possible since increase metabolic demand blood flow associate epileptic insult may compromise brain risk . Thus far , continuous EEG ( cEEG ) clinical instrument able detect development early epileptic activity . Unfortunately , cEEG available ICUs labor-intensive , expensive difficult interpret non-trained physician . Therefore , simple prognostic accurate EEG device highly warrant detect seizure early stage patient might benefit specific early treatment . A validation study comatose patient acute neurological insult conduct provide evidence simplify Bispectral Index EEG monitor potential detect epileptic activity reliable gold standard , full EEG monitoring . Thereby , BIS EEG monitoring could possibly use facilitate prognostication management epileptic seizure patient cohort could eventually improve clinical outcome .</brief_summary>
