	<brief_summary>SSC-CIP increase patient critical illness . Pathogenesis still largely unclear . The investigator hypothesize genetic variant biliary transporter gene frequent patient SSC-CIP . In approximately 140 patient controls rate genetic variant biliary transporter gene , gut permeability gut microbiome well bone health study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>SSC process fibroobliteration intra- extrahepatic bile duct due fact bile duct receive blood supply exclusively hepatic artery therefore prone ischemia part liver . Several factor , intraductal stone disease , surgical blunt abdominal trauma , intra-arterial chemotherapy , recurrent pancreatitis lead SSC . A relatively new entity SSC occur critical illness ( SSC-CIP ) . So far 97 case report literature . All patient recover critical illness , receive ventilation positive end-expiratory pressure vasopressor . A rapid increase cholestasis irregular stricture intrahepatic bile duct observe within week onset critical illness . On endoscopic retrograde cholangiography typically biliary cast find . Patients SSC-CIP furthermore distinct microbial profile bile frequent detection difficult treat organism . To date , liver transplantation ( select patient ) provide curative treatment . Prognosis SSC-CIP poor mortality rate 36 % 18 month need liver transplantation 23 % . To date much know potential risk factor development SSC-CIP . Since patient receive high pressure ventilation vasopressor develop SSC-CIP , hypothesize , patient-specific , factor may play role development SSC-CIP . Since disease bile duct , genetic variant biliary transporter might play role . Genetic variant bile acid transporter , BSEP ( Bile salt export pump ) MDR3 ( multidrug resistance protein 3 ) describe inducer modifier liver disease , intrahepatic cholestasis pregnancy , drug induce cholestasis treatment success hepatitis C. Another potentially important underreported problem SSC-CIP impair bone health . It well know , chronic liver disease , often result metabolic bone disease : reduce bone mineral density find 60 % atraumatic fracture 20 % patient . Specifically chronic cholestatic liver disease associate increased fracture risk . This result spontaneous low-impact fracture patient , adversely affect quality life survival . However , data bone mineral density bone mineral metabolism SSC-CIP available yet . The investigator therefore aim analyse panel potentially relevant gene bile acid transport bile composition patient SSC-CIP identify potential genetic variant associate development SSC-CIP . Serum marker bone mineral metabolism osteodensitometry data obtain . Furthermore , since microbial profile bile SSC-CIP patient show predominance difficult treat pathogen , change gut microbiome composition and/or gut permeability consecutive translocation bacterial product circulation might relevance . From clinical point view mortality SSC-CIP often relate multi-organ failure . Since infection play important role development multi-organ failure , investigator also hypothesize , SSC-CIP lead impairment innate immune response .</detailed_description>
