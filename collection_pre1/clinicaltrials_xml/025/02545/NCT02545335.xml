	<brief_title>Neutrophil Function During Therapy With Protease Inhibitors Chronic Hepatitis C</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic hepatitis C infection ( CHC ) major health problem , potentially lead liver relate mortality via complication liver cirrhosis hepatocellular carcinoma , affect 185 million person worldwide . Antiviral therapy evolve past 25 year standard interferon , combination ribavirin pegylated interferon ( P/R ) addition protease inhibitor currently edge interferon-free era first substance approve 2014 . However , current standard therapy CHC genotype 1 patient without cirrhosis consist ribavirin pegylated interferon ( P/R ) combination boceprevir ( BOC ) telaprevir ( TPV ) , direct act antiviral represent first-generation protease inhibitor . Triple therapy CHC report associated quantitative qualitative increase treatment-related ( serious ) adverse event compare former standard therapy without protease-inhibitors . Moreover , report serious infectious complication triple therapy - especially patient acquire immune deficiency like liver cirrhosis - lead considerable morbidity mortality , accumulate recently . The mechanism increase susceptibility infection remain unclear . However , BOC know inhibit neutrophil elastase activity . Aims study therefore analyse infection occur CHC outpatient therapy study centre , prospectively characterize neutrophil function patient undergo CHC triple therapy comparison dual therapy peginterferon ribavirin thereby elucidate possible mechanism protease-inhibitor associate infection .</detailed_description>
