	<detailed_description>This prospective randomize single blind clinical trial conduct suburban pediatric emergency department treat approximately 29,000 patient per year . Patients 0-17 year superficial skin soft tissue abscess large 3 cm would appropriate ED I &amp; D outpatient management screen inclusion . Patients exclude immunocompromised ( take chemotherapy , steroid bioactive medication diabetes mellitus ) , require subspecialist drainage require hospitalization . Subjects require provide assent age-appropriate , parental consent obtain . The parent guardian need emergency department child provide consent . Subjects randomize either traditional I &amp; D arm minimally invasive vessel loop arm use number sealed envelops . Computer block randomize numbered envelope . Inside envelope instruction treat physician two standard technique employ . - Standardized I &amp; D perform # 11 blade scalpel full thickness cut incise lesion along least 50 % abscess diameter . The pocket probe break septation residual cavity irrigate normal saline . Iodinated gauze 0.25 inch use loosely pack remain cavity physician deem pack necessary . The gauze leave trail surgical incision . The abscess cover 4 X 4 dry gauze tap place . - Minimally invasive I &amp; D vessel loop preform make 5mm incision # 11 blade area maximal fluctuance . The cavity probe forceps break septation . The forceps use find furthest extent cavity , # 11 blade use make 5mm incision tip forceps ( farthest extent cavity ) . The forceps push second incision . The vessel loop grasp forceps pull back surgical incision . The vessel loop tie loosely together , create loop back surgical incision . Both side incision irrigate normal saline . Cultures obtain , possible , abscess . Pain medication sedation time I &amp; D leave discretion treat physician . Antibiotics mandate , allow judgment treat medical team . All subject give 2 prescription analgesia home . One mild pain , ibuprofen ; another moderate severe pain , acetaminophen hydrocodone ( either liquid pill ) give . Equipotent alternative provide case medication allergy . Pain score assess use ten point scale procedure 48 hour follow . Data record first visit include demographic ( age , male/female ) , characteristic abscess , fever , duration symptom , history prior abscess , antibiotic last month , provision antibiotic post-procedure . All subject return ER 72 hour 1 week recheck . At 3rd day visit , wound pack remove . Large cavity repacked discretion ED physician . Loops cut removed 7th day visit unless significant cellulitis remain . If cellulitis remain 7 day , additional visits/hospitalization would set treat doctor discretion . Given failure treatment possible event abscess drainage , even involve study , hospitalization additional visit beyond 2 include study , bill patient 's family and/or insurance company visit ER hospital admission . Patients family also contact one month via telephone interview . Self-rated cosmetic outcome assess use 10 point scale bad best look scar .</detailed_description>
