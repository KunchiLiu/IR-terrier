An altered brain-gut axis accept main pathogenetic mechanism IBS , associate dysfunction GI autonomic nervous system . These alteration may lead abnormal visceral hypersensitivity aberration gut motility . Recently , additional potential mechanism IBS emerge include alteration gut microbiota low-grade inflammation/immune activation . These factor might lead abnormal motility visceral hypersensitivity contribute symptom . Na√Øve gut microbiota play important role maintenance gut homeostasis direct bactericidal effect evolution innate adaptive immune system . Gut microbiota think play important role pathogenesis IBS . This evident fact IBS occur frequently intestinal infection antibiotic treatment . Studies show alteration intestinal microbiota observe IBS patients.Considering relationship alteration gut microbiota inflammation gut , manipulation gut microbiota probiotic appear ideal treatment modality IBS .
