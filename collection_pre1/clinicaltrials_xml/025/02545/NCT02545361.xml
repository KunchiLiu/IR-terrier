	<detailed_description>Subjects screen visit determination eligibility . Up 40 evaluable subject include study ; 30 stage 1 , 10 stage 2 . The study divide 2 stage : - Dose escalation - Stage 1A 1B - Dose Confirmation Phase - Stage 2 Stage 1A : Will start 3 subject receive premedication ( 20mg Dexamethasone Intravenous ( IV ) , 10mg Loratadine Per Os ( P.O ) , 1gr Paracetamol ( P.O ) , 1 hour treatment ) 2 micrograms/kilograms ( µg/kg ) KAHR-102 subcutaneous ( SC ) injection every 14 day 3 injection . 3 injection define 1 cycle . Eligible subject hospitalize 48 hour follow study drug administration . Blood collect 24 hour ( h ) follow study drug administration biochemistry , hematology cytokine level . Pharmacokinetic ( PK ) sample collect hospitalization first third KAHR-102 SC injection . Sampling PK repeat Day 4 , 7 , 32 35 . Sampling Anti Drug Antibodies ( ADAs ) take 3 KAHR-102 SC injection . CT scan ADAs repeat Day 49 . Stage 1B : Based safety result Stage 1A Clinical Safety Committee ( CSC ) decision , 12 eligible subject assign 1 4 cohort receive SC injection KAHR-102 pre-medication ( 20mg Dexamethasone ( IV ) , 10mg Loratadine ( P.O ) , 1gr Paracetamol ( P.O ) , 1 hour KAHR-102 SC injection , every 7 day 3 injection start 2µg/kg KAHR-102 SC injection . 3 injection define 1 Cycle . Eligible subject hospitalize 48 hour follow KAHR-102 SC injection . Blood sample collect 24h follow administration KAHR-102 SC injection biochemistry , hematology cytokine level . PK sample collect hospitalization first third KAHR-102 SC injection . PK also assess Days 4 , 7 ( administration second KAHR-102 SC injection ) , 18 21 . Sampling ADA test take administration first third KAHR-102 SC injection . CT scan ADA sampling perform Day 35 . Stage 2 : Following completion Stage 1 , safety assessment CSC determination MTD perform . 10 subject treat MTD . KAHR-102 SC injection give every 7 day 3 injection . 3 injection define 1 Cycle . Subjects hospitalize treatment 48 hour follow KAHR-102 SC injection . Blood collect 24h follow administration KAHR-102 SC injection biochemistry , hematology , cytokine level . PK sample take hospitalization first third KAHR-102 SC injection repeat day 4 , 7 ( administration second injection ) , 18 , 21 . Samples ADA test collect prior first third KAHR-102 SC injection . At Day 35 ADA sample CT scan repeat . Cycles repeat frequency 28 day third KAHR-102 SC injection 1st cycle 14 day 2nd cycle follow cycle Treatment discontinue base investigator decision CT scan show evidence disease progression safety issue .
