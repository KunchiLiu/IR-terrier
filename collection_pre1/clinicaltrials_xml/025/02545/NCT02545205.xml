	<brief_summary>The overall purpose project establish add value train Hybrid Assistive Limb ( HAL ) exoskeleton system part regular rehabilitation intervention program stroke . The main specific aim : - demonstrate effect train HAL part current , best available , regular inpatient rehabilitation comparison effect current , best available regular inpatient rehabilitation program , post acute phase ( start 4-7 week ) stroke regard gait cardio-vascular function , activity participation ; - explore factor predict outcome/good responder train HAL ; - estimate health care utilisation cost effectiveness use HAL first year stroke .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>New Technology Individualised , Intensive Training Gait After Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary aim evaluate effectiveness : - training HAL part regular inpatient rehabilitation start 4-7 week stroke - regular inpatient rehabilitation , independence ambulation intervention compare Functional Ambulation Category group . Secondary aim comprise effectiveness training HAL independence gait function quality , cardiovascular function , activity daily live participation assess end intervention 6 12 month follow-up . Effects health care consumption 12 month intervention explore treatment related adverse event study document . Further , association spasticity versus HAL mediate recovery also explore . Intensive gait training HAL perform , 1 session/day , 4 days/week 4 week . Time session individualise exceed 60 minutes/session ( effective walking time HAL ) . During 4 week patient also receive conventional gait training provide regular staff clinic . After intervention , conventional in-patient training continue patient discharge home-based rehabilitation . To standardize training procedure , train HAL perform treadmill enable body weight support . Body weight support use prevent fall unburden weight suit ( 9 kg ) . The training program perform physiotherapist , train HAL method study procedure . The control group receive conventional gait training , perform accord current best evidence base practice may include ground walk assistance and/or assistant device well use treadmill body weight support training gait function activity daily live .</detailed_description>
