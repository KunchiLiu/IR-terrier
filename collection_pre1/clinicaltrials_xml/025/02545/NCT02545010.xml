	<brief_summary>Background : Epithelial Ovarian Cancer lethal amongst gynecologic malignancy fifth lead cause cancer death woman United States.1 Despite initial high response rate , 50 % 75 % woman present advanced disease suffer relapse require treatment2.The optimal treatment platinum resistant ovarian cancer remain hotly debate . Combination chemotherapy favor due increase toxicity lack convince benefit compare single agent chemotherapy.3,4 Recently , addition bevacizumab single agent chemotherapy AURELIA study improve progression free survival ( PFS ) 3.4 month 6.7 month . Response rate also improve 11.8 % versus 27.3 % ( p= 0 .001 ) .9 Aim : To determine maximal tolerate dose ( MTD ) weekly paclitaxel combination LDWART . The recommended phase II dose ( RP2D ) base MTD Phase I study . Method : This study design prospective , single arm phase I study 3+3 dose de-escalation cohort expansion . All patient receive weekly paclitaxel pre specify dose 80 mg/m2 , 70 mg/m2 , 60mg/m2 50 mg/m2 via intravenous infusion accord institution specific standard practice . Cycles chemotherapy administer weekly without interruption Days 1,8,15,22,29,36 total 6 weekly cycle combination LDWART ( Fig.1 ) . LDWART give 60 cGy fraction , twice daily two day , minimum 4 hour inter fraction interval , start day 1 cycle weekly paclitaxel 6 weeks. ( Fig.1 ) . Importance propose research : The combination LDWART weekly paclitaxel may improve efficacy current standard weekly paclitaxel platinum resistant ovarian cancer patient . Potential benefit risk : The combination may improve treatment response . Adding LDWART may increase treatment risk , monitor closely .</brief_summary>
