	<detailed_description>The body 's immune system subsequent inflammatory response trigger infection . The detection activate immune system , indication degree host response , helpful clinician assess severity infection patient treatment management . Currently , white blood cell count differential common laboratory parameter measure host response . The sedimentation rate CRP also use detect inflammation . However , test imperfect predictor , test providing well assessment immune response would helpful clinician patient care . Additionally , understand host response infection may helpful understand biology pathophysiology sepsis . There biomarkers inflammatory marker may find early initial presentation infection cytokine ( VEGF IL-1 , IL-4 , IL-6 , IL-10 , PAF , TNF , lectins iNoS , etc . ) clot factor ( protein C , d-dimer , complement involve clot cascade , CRP , etc ) may provide mean early detection systemic inflammation , cell dysfunction , related condition . Early identification patient risk systemic inflammatory syndrome , sepsis septic shock may help direct patient earlier antibiotic administration early intervention goal direct therapy . It may also serve tool risk stratification component age , comorbid illness infection type include . The endothelium endothelial cell marker important sepsis , yet somewhat under-studied field research . Additionally , endothelium key regulator microcirculation , place oxygen diffusion occur . One focus study measure endothelial marker ( ie VEGF ) cytokine goal correlate marker severity sepsis . Another focus study response various component blood , include leukocyte , red cell , endothelium , well cellular component mitochondrion . We specifically look alteration thiamine , Vitamin D , CoQ10 , l-carnitine nutrient part ( relate ) body 's response . Recently , non-invasive method assess microvascular circulation orthogonal polarization spectral ( OPS ) imagery become available use non-invasive technology know orthogonal polarization spectroscopy . This technique enable direct visualization quantification microcirculatory blood flow , represent important surrogate outcome endothelial cell marker may correlate . This involve place microscopy probe gently sublingual mucosa collect videotape circulation last twenty second . This process involve minimal ( ) risk - akin taking temperature use radiation . This videotape examine later novel software program quantifies circulation use important surrogate outcome measure . Additionally , go perform echocardiography well understand heart 's response sepsis , correlate molecular response find change response heart . This multicenter , observational pilot study aim evaluate early biomarkers infection inflammation perform identify patient risk poor outcome sepsis septic shock . The study utilize cohort patient present ED suspect infection well non-infected control population . These patient compare non-infected population . Enrolled subject infect group blood sample chart review obtain enrollment , 24 , 48 72 hour . For control group , single blood draw collect enrollment . Enrolled subject also undergo physiologic assessment use echocardiography , Microscan , Non-invasive cardiac output monitor ( NICOM ) , extremity temperature well End-Tidal C02 measurement train researcher present .</detailed_description>
