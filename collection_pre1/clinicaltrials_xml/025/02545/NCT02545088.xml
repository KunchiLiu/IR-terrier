	<brief_summary>The overall purpose project establish add value train Hybrid Assistive Limb ( HAL ) exoskeleton system part regular rehabilitation intervention program stroke . The main specific aim - demonstrate effect intensive training HAL comparison intensive training without HAL standard care , later phase ( 1-10 year ) stroke regard gait cardio-vascular function , activity participation ; - estimate health care utilisation cost effectiveness use HAL first year stroke .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>New Technology Individualised , Intensive Training Gait After Stroke- Study II</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary aim study compare effectiveness : - intensive training HAL , - intensive training without HAL - standard training , later phase ( 1-10 year ) stroke independence ambulation intervention compare Functional Ambulation Category group . Secondary aim comprise effectiveness training HAL independence gait function quality , cardiovascular function , activity daily live participation assess end intervention 6 12 month follow-up . Effects health care consumption 12 month intervention explore treatment related adverse event study document . Further , association range movement , strength spasticity versus HAL mediate recovery also explore . Intensive gait training HAL perform 1 session/day , 3 days/week 6 week session exceed 60 min effective walking time HAL . In addition , session include conventional gait train exceed 30 min effective training time . To standardize training procedure , train HAL perform treadmill enable body weight support . Body weight support use prevent fall unburden weight suit ( 9 kg ) . The training program perform physiotherapist , train HAL method study procedure . At end 6 week , physiotherapist engage patient 's conventional training perform 1-2 home visit inform/educate patient provide assistance patient patient make use gain gait function activity daily live . The 1st control group receive conventional gait training perform 1 session/day , 3 days/week 6 week exceed 1h 30 min effective training time . The 2nd control group receive intervention . The conventional gait training perform accord current best evidence base practice may include ground walk assistance and/or assistant device well use treadmill body weight support training gait function activity daily live</detailed_description>
