	<detailed_description>1 . To observe immunity-mediated tumor response Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy ( SBRT ) metastatic site metastatic esophageal cancer patient . 2 . To induce efficacy ( effectiveness ) new combination therapy , SBRT thymalfasin heavily pretreated , metastatic esophageal cancer patient ; Eligible patient metastatic esphageal cancer achieve stable disease disease progression systemic therapy ( surgery definitive chemoradiotherapy ) least two measurable site metastatic lesion . Extent metastatic disease record CT PET/CT scan . Radiation give combine therapy one lesion , 25Gy 5 fraction one week interval SBRT , conformally maximally spare normal tissue organ . Thymalfasin treatment give twice week interval 3-4 day week total 8 week . Tumor response evaluate assess clinical CT/MRI response measurable metastatic site . A Phase II clinical trial base optimum two-stage Phase II Simon design use conduct pilot study . Ten patient treated Stage one ; tumor response , trial terminate . If one tumor responses Stage One , trial proceed enroll additional 19 patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients histologically confirm esophageal cancer persistent metastatic recurrent metastatic ; 2 . Patients must least 2 distinct measurable metastatic site least 1 cm large large diameter ; 3 . Age ≥18 year ; 4 . Metastatic disease measurable CT/MRI scan . The primary tumor consider measurable disease . Metastatic lesion within prior radiation field acceptable long disease progress radiation field RECIST criterion . The image modality perform baseline ( CT MRI ) repeat subsequent imaging . 5 . ECOG performance status : 01 ; 6 . Life expectancy ≥ 3 month . 7 . Patients adequate baseline organ marrow function define absolute neutrophil count great 1500 cell per μL , platelet concentration great 50 000 per μL , total bilirubin le 1•5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) , aspartate aminotransferase alanine aminotransferase less 2•5 time ULN , serum creatinine le 1•5 time ULN ; 8 . Signed consent form voluntarily ; 1 . Patients undergo therapy investigational agent . 2 . Women pregnant breastfeeding ; 3 . Patients know brain metastasis include clinical trial brain lesion eligible target non target lesion ; 4 . Anticipated patient survival 3 month ; 5 . Active severe infection know chronic infection HIV , hepatitis B virus , hepatitis C virus ; 6 . Cardiovascular disease problem include unstable angina , therapy lifethreatening ventricular arrhythmia , myocardial infarction , stroke congestive heart failure within last 6 month ; 7 . The subject another active malignancy within past five year except cervical cancer site , situ carcinoma bladder nonmelanoma carcinoma skin ; 8 . Clinically significant uncontrolled major medical condition include limited : active uncontrolled infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , Unstable angina pectoris cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/ social situation would limit compliance study requirement ; medical condition , opinion study investigator place subject unacceptably high risk toxicity ; 9 . Patients concurrent disease , judgment investigator , would make patient inappropriate participation study .</criteria>
