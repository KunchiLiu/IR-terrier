	<detailed_description>Laparoscopic common bile duct exploration way deal common bile duct stone gain increase acceptance . Following cholangiotomy , however , risk bile leakage incision . A way avoid leakage follow cholangiotomy may apply fibrin sealant cholangiotomy . The present study base patient undergo laparoscopic cholecystectomy department surgery , Enk√∂ping hospital , Sweden . The patient inform study prior procedure . Cholangiography perform routinely . In case common bile duct stone encounter cholangiography , incision make common bile duct stone extract . After stone extraction , tube introduce cholangiotomy incision close run Vicryl suture . When cholangiotomy close , randomisation perform seal envelope system . If patient randomise fibrin sealant , apply cholangiotomy . A passive drain introduce abdomen close . Postoperatively , amount bile passive drain measure observer randomise allocation . If amount bile drain exceed 100 ml three day postoperatively , secondary cholangiography perform tube . If contrast pass duodenum contrast leakage see , tube withdrawn . All postoperative complication register accord Clavien-Dindo system .</detailed_description>
