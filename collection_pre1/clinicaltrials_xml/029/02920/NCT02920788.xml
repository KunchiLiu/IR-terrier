	<brief_summary>One pressing concern within VA currently provision intervention address cognitive well emotional problem face Veterans mild TBI comorbid condition . When complete , study inform u whether train core attentional self-regulatory control function via personally-relevant activity effective improve daily life Veterans mild TBI comorbid condition . The study design provide test potential benefit real life functioning , also determine extent benefit relate actual change cognitive/behavioral performance brain network correspond function . This project provide foundation future study investigate neural mechanism support improvement cognition behavior mTBI .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Combat-related mild traumatic brain injury ( mTBI ) co-morbid condition prevalent return Veterans report rate range 14- 22 % . Chronic sequela mTBI highly debilitate due deficit cognitive control process , include attention , executive function , memory . In prior study , individual chronic acquire brain injury participate cognitive training program , Goal-Oriented Attentional Self-Regulation ( GOALS ) , target executive control function apply mindfulness-based attention regulation goal management , improve cognitive performance area : complex attention/executive function memory , complex functional task performance , daily functioning . Furthermore , functional MRI ( fMRI ) result train indicated significantly enhance modulation neural processing . Preliminary data recently complete randomized-control GOALS study 32 Veterans chronic TBI also show short long term ( 2 year ) improvement attention executive function , complex real-life task , emotional regulation . The primary objective study investigate potential short long term effect GOALS cognitive training program , use advance MRI investigate change brain structure function circuit regulate attention , memory , executive function emotion Veterans chronic mTBI . The investigator postulate 1 ) GOALS train improve neurocognitive function attention executive function domain , complex functional task performance , emotional regulation Veterans chronic mTBI ; 2 ) improve neurocognitive function correlate macrostructural , microstructural functional change correspond brain network high field ( 3T ) ultra-high field ( 7T ) structural MR imaging , diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) rest state fMRI perform pre- post-training ; 3 ) Changes behavioral function image measure maintain 6 month post-training associated improvement activity participation . AIM 1 : To determine short long term effect GOALS train neuro-cognitive performance neural plasticity attention executive control network mTBI . AIM 2 : To determine short long term effect GOALS training complex functional task performance daily function , plasticity pathway related memory function , mTBI . AIM 3 : To determine short long term effect GOALS train measure emotional regulation , plasticity frontolimbic network relate emotion processing , mTBI In randomize , control interventional study design , 36 Veterans history chronic ( &gt; 6 month ) mTBI residual cognitive difficulty randomize participate 5 week cognitive training ( GOALS ) treatment usual ( TAU ) comparison . At baseline , week 5 ( post GOALS ) , 6 month , participant undergo multi-level assessment battery consisting : 1 ) neuroimaging high field ( 3T ) ultra-high field ( 7T ) structural MR imaging , diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) rest state fMRI ; 2 ) neuropsychological assessment focus complex attention executive function ; 3 ) complex 'real life ' functional task performance ; 4 ) self-report measure daily function emotional regulation/heath . When complete , project determine whether train core attentional self-regulatory control function via personally-relevant activity effective improve quality life daily function Veterans mTBI . The study design provide test potential benefit real-life functioning , also determine extent benefit relate actual change hypothetically target cognitive/behavioral function brain network correspond function .</detailed_description>
