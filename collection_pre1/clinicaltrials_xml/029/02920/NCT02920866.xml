	<brief_title>Improving Rehabilitation Outcomes After Total Hip Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over next 20 year , number total hip arthroplasty ( THAs ) perform alleviate pain disability associate osteoarthritis ( OA ) expect double 500,000/year . Most patient report improve health-related quality life follow surgery ; however , deficit physical function quality life persist . Specifically , Veterans THA high prevalence severe activity daily living ( ADL ) limitation report severe physical health-related quality life deficit . The increased THA utilization , combine long-term functional deficit increase heath care utilization , suggest need target rehabilitation strategy improve physical function Veterans THA . Movement compensation biomarker functional decline variety old adult population . For patient THA , persistent movement compensation see activity daily live , level walking , sit-to-stand transition , stair climb . These movement compensation likely stem combination poor muscle strength failure integrate available muscle strength functional movement . Functional strength integration ( FSI ) daily task refers ability body produce stable , coordinated movement . At hip joint , optimal FSI largely dependent ability hip abductor muscle produce sufficient hip abduction moment stabilize pelvis unilateral stance task . Thus , inability integrate hip abductor muscle strength functional task result poor pelvic stability movement compensation . Lack FSI possibly explain deficit functional recovery THA . However , current rehabilitation practice target integration strength functional movement resolve movement compensation . Rehabilitation emphasize functional strength integration THA potential substantially improve postoperative physical function remediate movement compensation great hip abductor strength recruitment function , provide great pelvic control well movement quality . Therefore , investigator propose randomize controlled trial 100 participant determine 8-week functional strength integration ( FSI ) program THA improve physical function muscle performance control intervention ( CON ) unilateral THA . The secondary goal determine FSI improve movement compensation functional activity ( walk stair climb ) . Eight week intervention initiate 2 week THA allow early tissue healing . Outcomes assess pre-operatively ( PRE ) ; intervention mid-point ( 4 week intervention ; POST1 ) ; intervention end-point ( 8 week intervention ; POST2 ) ( primary endpoint ) ; late recovery ( 26 week initiate rehabilitation ; POST3 ) .</detailed_description>
