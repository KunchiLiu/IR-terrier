	<brief_summary>The overall goal change paradigm development mechanism target pharmacotherapy neurodevelopmental disorder provide definitive test mGluR theory human determine whether AFQ056 , mGluR5 negative modulator , enhance neural plasticity form language learn intensive language intervention young child fragile X syndrome . This trial therefore use innovative exploratory new trial design develop different way examine efficacy agent substantial support drug target CNS plasticity preclinical model developmental disorder . If design successful , trial serve model future trial mechanistically-targeted treatment operate neural plasticity neurodevelopmental disorder .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>AFQ056 Language Learning Children With FXS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial use double blind placebo-controlled parallel-group flexible-dose force titration design 100 subject FXS , age 32 month 6 year age enter 8-month placebo-controlled phase randomize 1:1 AFQ056 placebo follow 8-month ( open label ) extension phase participant treat active drug . The flexible dose design mimic practice , take account differential responsiveness know inter-child variability drug level AFQ056 , allow use maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) likely effective .</detailed_description>
