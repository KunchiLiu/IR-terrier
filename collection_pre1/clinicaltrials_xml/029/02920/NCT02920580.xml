	<brief_summary>This randomize controlled trial enrol patient acute severe brain injury pass spontaneous breathe trial decrease level consciousness . It directly compare ( 1 ) prompt extubation vs. ( 2 ) prompt tracheostomy vs. ( 3 ) usual care , extubation tracheostomy time accord physician ' discretion . The primary outcome ICU free day ( day spend alive outside ICU ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Thousands patient suffer severe brain injury every year , cause trauma , stroke , infection . Extensive clinical research wean mechanical ventilation lead recommendation prompt extubation follow successful trial spontaneous breathe general intensive care unit ( ICU ) . However , little evidence exists guide decision remove breathe tube patient severe brain injury . It unclear follow strategy would optimize important patient outcome : prompt extubation vs. prompt tracheostomy vs. wait extubating perform tracheostomy , time accord physician ' discretion . Each strategy associate risk : prompt extubation may lead high rate extubation failure reintubation , prompt tracheostomy may lead excess unnecessary procedure , wait longer may expose patient complication prolong mechanical ventilation.This trial brain-injured patient test follow lead well patient outcome : ( 1 ) remove temporary breathing tube promptly ; ( 2 ) perform tracheostomy promptly ; ( 3 ) usual treatment would receive enrolled trial .</detailed_description>
