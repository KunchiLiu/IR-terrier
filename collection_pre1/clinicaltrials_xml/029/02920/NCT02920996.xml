	<brief_summary>This research study examine merestinib ( targeted therapy ) possible treatment non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) find specific change MET gene ( MET exon 14 mutation ) ; treatment solid tumor alteration NTRK gene ( NTRK1 , 2 , 3 rearrangement ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This open-label , phase II study merestinib patient advance NSCLC MET exon 14 mutation patient advance cancer harbor NTRK1 , 2 , 3 rearrangement . Twenty patient MET mutation evaluate single-arm design . A small separate cohort 5 NTRK patient evaluate exploratory purpose . Merestinib ( LY2801653 ) small molecule show vitro reversible type II ATP-competitive inhibitor MET . Pre-clinical testing also show merestinib inhibit several receptor tyrosine oncokinases include MST1R , FLT3 , AXL , MERTK , TEK , ROS1 , NTRK1/2/3 , DDR1/2 serine/threonine kinases MKNK1/2 .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Baseline evaluation conduct within 14 day prior start protocol therapy , exception inform consent baseline tumor imaging may obtain 28 day prior start protocol therapy . For enrollment MET cohort : Participants must histologically cytologically confirm advanced NSCLC must receive least one prior line therapy metastatic setting . For enrollment NTRK cohort : Participants must histologically cytologically confirm advanced solid tumor must receive least one prior line therapy metastatic setting . Participants enrol MET cohort must MET exon 14 mutation confirm targeted NextGen Sequencing use DFCI/BWH OncoPanel another CLIAcertified method . Participants whose NSCLC specimens contain actionable genetic mutations/alterations ( e.g . ALK/EGFR ) receive appropriate target therapy prior enrollment trial . Participants enrol NTRK cohort must NTRK1 , 2 , 3 rearrangement confirm targeted NextGen Sequencing use DFCI/BWH OncoPanel another CLIAcertified method . Participants must measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record nonnodal lesion short axis nodal lesion ) ≥ 20 mm conventional technique ≥ 10 mm spiral CT scan , MRI , caliper clinical exam . Participants enrol MET cohort receive treatment prior MET inhibitor must able willing undergo baseline tumor biopsy . Participants enrol NTRK cohort receive treatment prior NTRK inhibitor must able willing undergo baseline tumor biopsy . Age ≥ 18 year . As dose adverse event data currently available participant &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study eligible future pediatric trial . ECOG performance status ≤ 1 ( see Appendix A ) . Participants must normal organ marrow function define : Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 K/uL Platelets ≥ 100 K/uL Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL ( without transfusion support ) Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 × institutional ULN , unless liver metastasis present ≤ 5 × institutional ULN acceptable Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 × institutional ULN The effect merestinib develop human fetus unknown . For reason MET inhibitor agent know teratogenic , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Men treat enrol protocol must also agree use adequate contraception prior study , duration study participation , 4 month completion merestinib administration . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Participants must able swallow retain oral medication enteral feeding tube place study drug administration . Participants chemotherapy , investigational therapy , major surgery , radiotherapy within 3 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study . Participants recover eligibility level adverse event due agent administer 3 week earlier . Participants receive investigational agent . Participants know untreated brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . Participants history brain metastasis treat , longer take corticosteroid , stable image ≥ 4 week follow last date treatment permit . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition merestinib . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman exclude study merestinib agent potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother merestinib , breastfeed discontinue mother treated merestinib . Known HIVpositive participant ineligible participant increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Appropriate study undertake participant receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate . Participants enrol MET cohort receive prior MET inhibitor may anticoagulant therapy unless investigator deem safe temporarily hold facilitate baseline tumor biopsy . Participants enrol NTRK cohort receive prior NTRK inhibitor may anticoagulant therapy unless investigator deem safe temporarily hold facilitate baseline tumor biopsy . Participants uncontrolled high blood pressure , define blood pressure screen ≥ 160/100 despite medical management . Participants must clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormality opinion treat investigator may alter absorption oral medication , malabsorption syndrome major resection stomach bowel . Participants history second primary malignancy . Exceptions include : patient history malignancy treat curatively recur within 3 year prior study entry ; resect basal squamous cell carcinoma skin , completely resect carcinoma situ type .</criteria>
