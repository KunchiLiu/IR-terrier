	<brief_summary>This study evaluate efficacy eight-week online cognitive training program objective subjective cognitive function Parkinson 's disease . Moreover , intend map effect brain network function , cognitive training prevent development PD-MCI/PD-D one-year follow-up . In study , two training group compare ( N : 60 v 60 ) . In half participant MRI magnetoencephalography ( MEG ) assess ( N : 30 vs. 30 ) . We expect cognitive training improve cognitive function , improve efficiency brain network function . Moreover , expect cognitive training decrease risk PD-MCI/PD-D one-year follow-up .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND In Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) , cognitive dysfunction frequently report - approximately 50 % PD patient experience cognitive impairment ( Litvan et al. , 2011 ) . Of impairment , executive dysfunction frequently report early disease trajectory ( Bosboom , Stoffers , &amp; Wolters , 2004 ; Muslimovic , Post , Speelman , &amp; Schmand , 2005 ) , impairment cognitive domain ( i.e . attention , episodic memory , visuospatial function ) also highly prevalent ( Bosboom et al. , 2004 ) . The majority PD patient ultimately develop PD dementia ( PD-D ; Aarsland , Andersen , Larsen , Lolk , &amp; Kragh-Sorensen , 2003 ; Hely , Reid , Adena , Halliday , &amp; Morris , 2008 ) . Moreover , 10 % PD patient develop PD-D every year ( Aarsland &amp; Kurz , 2010 ) . Cognitive dysfunction PD significant negative influence quality life ( Klepac , Trkulja , Relja , &amp; Babic , 2008 ) , treatment dysfunction infancy . Cognitive training may provide new intervention reduce cognitive complaint delay onset mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) PD-D . This intervention widely study disease ( Cicerone et al. , 2011 ; Olazaran et al. , 2010 ) . Moreover , study provide evidence behavioral influence , also brain connectivity activity effect cognitive training ( Chapman et al. , 2015 ; Castellanos et al. , 2010 ; Subramaniam et al. , 2012 ; Subramaniam et al. , 2014 ; Belleville et al. , 2011 ; Rosen , Sugiura , Kramer , Whitfield-Gabrieli , &amp; Gabrieli , 2011 ) . This suggest restorative effect cognitive training disrupt brain network . In PD , cognitive dysfunction - mainly executive dysfunction - associate disruption cortico-striato-thalamo-corticale circuit depletion dopamine . Dysfunction circuit seem disrupt several cognitive network , lead cognitive dysfunction ( Baggio et al. , 2014 ) . Cognitive training could counteract disruption normalise activity connectivity , ultimately lead reduction impairment . Since early study different patient population show cognitive training lasting effect ( Petrelli et al. , 2015 ) , normalise disruption underlie cognitive impairment could prevent cognitive deterioration therefore prevent delay development PD-D. Few study PD focus cognitive training neural correlate . A meta-analysis Leung et al . ( 2015 ) show positive effect cognitive train mainly 'frontal ' cognitive function ( i.e . work memory , executive function , process speed ) . In addition , early research describe neuroprotective effect cognitive training development MCI PD ( odds ratio : 3 ; Petrelli et al. , 2015 ) . Until , however , study relatively small mainly without control design - consequently , need large randomize controlled study ( Hindle , Petrelli , Clare , &amp; Kalbe , 2013 ; Leung et al. , 2015 ) . Moreover , neural effect cognitive training largely unknown PD . Furthermore , important study improvement patient daily function cognitive training , rather solely focus cognitive task neural measure . Finally , cognitive training perform mainly hospital setting , PD patient mobility problem - train method suitable perform home therefore need population . OBJECTIVES The study objective primarily measure effect online cognitive training patient mild cognitive complaint PD . An online training , specifically alter PD patient ( BrainGymmer ) compare active comparator . In condition , participant train eight week , three time week 45 minute . Primary objective : - To measure effect online cognitive training ( compare active comparator ) , eight week , three time week , executive function patient mild cognitive complaint PD . Secondary objective : - To measure effect online cognitive training daily functioning . - To measure endurance training effect six month one year . - To assess reduce risk MCI PD-D development cognitive training . - To assess effect cognitive training brain network efficiency connectivity .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjective cognitive complaint , measure Parkinson 's Disease Cognitive Functional Rating Scale score &gt; 3 ( PDCFRS ) . A score 3 indicate significant cognitive complaint , milder complaint associate Parkinson 's disease dementia . This questionnaire fill patient . Participants ' Hoehn &amp; Yahr stage low 4 . Patients stable dopaminergic medication least month start intervention . During intervention , patient neurologist ask keep dopaminergic medication dosage stable possible . Participants access computer tablet , access Internet . If participant us computer , capable use keyboard computer mouse . Participants willing sign inform consent . General criterion : Indications dementia syndrome , measure Selfadministered Gerocognitive Examination score &lt; 14 Montreal Cognitive Assessment score &lt; 22 . Current drug alcohol abuse , measure score &gt; 1 four CAGE AIDquestions ( accord Trimbos guideline ) . The inability undergo extensive neuropsychological assessment , eight week intervention . Moderate severe depressive symptom , define Beck Depression Inventory score &gt; 18 . An impulse control disorder , include internet addiction , screen impulse control disorder criterion interview . Psychotic symptom , screen Questionnaire Psychotic Experiences . Benign hallucination insight contraindicate . Traumatic brain injury , case contusio cerebri 1 ) loss consciousness &gt; 15 minute 2 ) posttraumatic amnesia &gt; 1 hour . A space occupy lesion define radiologist , significant vascular abnormality ( Fazekas &gt; 1 ) . For participation MRI research : Severe claustrophobia Metal body ( example , deep brain stimulator pacemaker ) Pregnancy Problems shortness breath 60 minute lie still .</criteria>
