Sham stimulation The stimulation parameter tDCS treatment employ sham stimulation . However , current apply 30 second , give subject sensation stimulation . This method sham stimulation also validate ( Gandiga et al. , 2006 ) . Current intensity increase decrease gradually decrease perception rTMS A research staff supervise physician apply intervention rTMS subject . For TMS procedure , patient seat comfortably instruct remain still . The height chair adjust knee ankle flex 90 degree two foot rest floor . A tight swim cap worn subject . The vertex mark cap . Points 1 cm lateral and/or 1cm posterior/anterior mark cap . Subjects receive 10 Hz rTMS use Magstim Rapid2 , double cone coil place `` hot spot '' affect M1 . The stimulation intensity set 90 % RMT ( 80 % AMT , RMT available ) , total 1200 pulse deliver one treatment session . Outcome measure obtain , 2-week intervention 4 week post-intervention , include 1 ) clinical measure ( FAC , gait analysis , 10 meter walk test , 6 minute walk test , time go ) , 2 ) cortical excitability measure use TMS ( change rest motor threshold ( RMT ) , active motor threshold ( AMT ) affect unaffected TA short-interval cortical inhibition/facilitation ( SICI/SICF ) , measure accord technique Rossini et al . ( 1994 ) ) , 3 ) MRI measure include diffusion tensor tractography ( DTT ) , rest state protocol GABA scan . 4 ) Genotyping blood level BDNF . 5 ) Psychological cognitive assessment include Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI ) , Fatigue Severity Scale , forward backward digit span . Clinical measure ( 10 meter walk test , 6 minute walk test , time up-and-go test , gait analysis ) A research staff supervise physical therapist perform functional assessment subject National University Hospital . The functional assessment consist 10 meter walk test , 6 minute walk test time up-and-go test perform randomized order . The tester provide assistance patient make way around track , however , tester shadow patient attend problem need . The 10 meter walk test perform quiet indoor track 14 meter long . Subject walk comfortable pace usual . The test repeat 3 time average duration finish 10 meter walk total step record . The 6-minute walking test perform indoor track mark 5-metre interval . Subject walk comfortable pace usual . The distance 6 minute measure . The timed up-and-go test involve subject get standard armchair seat position , walk 3 meter chair , turn back walk chair seat back . Subject walk comfortable pace usual . The test repeat 3 time duration subject take perform whole task record average . 10 meter walk test , 6 minute walk test , time up-and-go test altogether take around 30 minute , include set-up time . Gait analysis perform use Tekscan walkway system . Subjects require walk mat comfort speed process might video-recorded future analyze quality subject ' movement ( face capture consent obtain advance ) . Gait parameter include step stride parameter , symmetry score , velocity , cadence temporal collect record subject walk along walkway . The whole procedure last 30 minute . TMS A research staff supervise physician apply TMS measurement cortical excitability intracortical inhibition/facilitation subject . For TMS procedure , patient seat comfortably instruct remain still . The height chair adjust knee ankle flex 90 degree two foot rest floor . A tight swim cap worn subject . The vertex mark cap . Points 1 cm lateral and/or 1cm posterior/anterior mark cap . Single pulse TMS-Resting motor threshold ( RMT ) measurement Singe pulse TMS deliver use Magstim Bistim² stimulator via double cone coil . The double cone coil orient induce posterior-anterior current flow cortex . The coil place cap intersection two embed coil locate mark point . The coil position maintain manually assistant . Surface electromyography ( EMG ) electrodes attached TA EMG recording . The `` hot spot '' motor evoke potential ( MEP ) TA identify first one mark point leave right side . This spot mark elastic cap use recording side . The low intensity need elicit MEP response least 50µV amplitude elicit 50 % 8 successive trial record RMT . Single pulse TMS-Active motor threshold ( AMT ) The measurement AMT similar RMT measurement . Except subject 's foot constrain flexible weight place dorsum foot ensure isometric activation . The subject give real time feedback EMG oscilloscope match target contraction correspond 20 % maximal voluntary isometric contraction ( MVIC ) TA . The low intensity need elicit MEP response least 100µV amplitude `` hot spot '' elicit 50 % 8 successive trial record AMT . Paired-pulse TMS- intracortical inhibition/facilitation measurement A first subthreshold conditioning stimulus ( 80 % RMT ) apply , follow second suprathreshold stimulus ( 120 % RMT ) variable interstimulus interval ( ISI ) . The following ISIs - 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 9 , 10 , 12 , 15 m use . The percentage change ISI TMS calculate MEPs therefore provide measure change intracortical facilitation inhibition . Both single- paired-pulse paradigm perform affected unaffected hemisphere . MRI scan ( rest MRI , DTI scan [ diffusion tensor Imaging ] , GABA scan ) MRI scan perform CIRC , NUS staff CIRC . Prior scan , subject brief test procedure safety aspect . All participant scan 3-T GE scanner use standard radiofrequency head coil . Head motion minimize foam pad forehead-restraining strap . Psychological cognitive assessment A research staff conduct Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI ) , Fatigue Severity Scale , forward backward digit span . Digit Span neuropsychological test widely use assess executive ability follow stroke sensitive brain damage ( Tamez et al. , 2011 ) . The Beck 's Depression Inventory use screen major depression . As tDCS investigate use treatment depression cognitive impairment , add digit span control confound effect cognitive improvement study.For subject screen positive major depression suicidal ideation , investigator perform screen inform physician investigator ass make necessary referral psychiatric assessment management . Blood BDNF level measurement Genotyping BDNF Blood take train research staff/research nurse analyze Neuroscience Laboratory , locate Translational Medicine Centre , Yong Loo Lin School use in-house commercial assay . 10-20 ml blood take time via venipuncture three time , intervention , 4 week intervention , respectively , , time point outcome measurement .
