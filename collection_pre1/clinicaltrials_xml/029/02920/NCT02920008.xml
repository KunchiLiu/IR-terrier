	<brief_summary>Multicenter , randomize , open-label , parallel-group study guadecitabine v treatment choice ( TC ) . Subjects randomly assign 1:1 ratio either guadecitabine TC . TC option include 8 high low intensity , locally available regimen ; Best supportive Care ( BSC ) alone : - High intensity ( intermediate high dose cytarabine [ HiDAC ] ; mitoxantrone , etoposide , cytarabine [ MEC ] ; fludarabine , cytarabine , granulocyte colony stimulate factor [ G-CSF ] , +/- idarubicin [ FLAG/FLAG-Ida ] ) . - Low intensity ( low dose cytarabine [ LDAC ] , decitabine , azacitidine ) . - BSC .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 3 Randomized , Open-Label Study Guadecitabine v Treatment Choice Previously Treated Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 3 , randomize , open-label , parallel-group multicenter study efficacy safety guadecitabine adult previously treat AML conduct approximately 20 country . There 14-day screening period , treatment period , safety follow-up visit , long-term follow-up period . The study expect last approximately 2 year . Duration individual subject participation vary , subject may continue receive treatment long continue benefit . Approximately 404 subject approximately 100 study center randomly assign either guadecitabine treatment choice ( TC ) 1:1 ratio ( approximately 202 subject per group ) . TC follow : - High intensity : intermediate high dose cytarabine ( HiDAC ) ; mitoxantrone , etoposide , cytarabine ( MEC ) ; fludarabine , cytarabine , G-CSF , +/- idarubicin ( FLAG/FLAG-Ida ) . - Low intensity : low dose cytarabine ( LDAC ) , decitabine , azacitidine . - Best Supportive Care ( BSC ) . Guadecitabine give SC dose 60 mg/m2 28-day cycle . In Cycle 1 , guadecitabine give 10 day Days 1-5 Days 8-12 . Cycle 2 either 5-day regimen ( Days 1-5 ) 10-day regimen ( Days 1-5 8-12 ) base assessment disease response hematologic recovery end Cycle 1 . In subsequent cycle , guadecitabine treatment 5 day ( Days 1-5 ) .</detailed_description>
