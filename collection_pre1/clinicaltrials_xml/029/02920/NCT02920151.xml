	<brief_title>Effects Balance Exercises Circuit Patients With Hip Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Balance Exercise Circuit ( BEC ) program , include exercise specifically challenge sensory input mechanoreceptors well visual vestibular system . It compose 13 station , involve static dynamic balance exercise , include tandem walking , forward-backward stepping , wide-stance gait , functional reach , heel lift , toe press , balance unstable surface , stand one leg . The BEC last 50 min , two time per week total 12 week . Progression exercise occur every 3 week closely supervised ensure safety . Each BEC session comprise warm-up stretching ( 10 min ) , exercise circuit ( 30 min ) , cool-down ( 10 min ) .</detailed_description>
