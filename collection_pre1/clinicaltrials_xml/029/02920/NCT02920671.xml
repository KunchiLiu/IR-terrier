	<brief_summary>Investigators recruit adult ( men woman , age 18 65 year , inclusive ) confirm genetic diagnosis mitochondrial disease . Investigators also recruit obese normal-weight healthy volunteer ( men woman , age 18 65 year , inclusive ) without family history mitochondrial disease compare affected individual . The study involve non-invasive MRI method glucose test focus relationship mitochondrial disease , obesity , risk diabetes . All study visit procedure complete within 2 day , include overnight stay Hospital University Pennsylvania . There study medication sedation , participant continually monitor minimally-invasive procedure ( e.g. , blood draw ) . All participant able receive compensation . Furthermore , may possible provide reimbursement travel , lodge , meal individual mitochondrial disease . Investigators hope research contribute current knowledge mitochondrial disease improve diagnostic treatment approach .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Although obesity significant public health problem , obesity lead diabetes individual others poorly understood . Mitochondrial impairment , particularly skeletal muscle high energy requirement , implicated pathogenesis obesity-related insulin resistance . In addition , individual genetic disorder affect mitochondrial function increase risk diabetes . The proposed study investigate association skeletal muscle oxidative phosphorylation capacity ( OXPHOS ) , dimension mitochondrial function , glucose lipid homeostasis ( ) individual genetic disorder muscle mitochondrial function compare ( ii ) non-obese adult ( iii ) otherwise healthy obese adult . During single 2-day , 1-night study visit , investigator use innovative , non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging-based method estimate skeletal muscle oxidative phosphorylation capacity , include post-exercise chemical exchange saturation transfer ( CrCEST ) recovery 31-Phosphorus ( 31P ) magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) muscle lipid content , include 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) 3-point Dixon technique , conjunction tracer-enhanced oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT* ) measure overall insulin sensitivity selective effect insulin glucose disposal ( Rd ) . The percentage suppression endogenous glucose production oral glucose load ( % suppression Ra endogenous glucose ) also assess . Infusion glycerol tracer permit assessment lipolysis fast state , also oral glucose load , percentage suppression lipolysis oral glucose load also calculate ( % suppression Ra glycerol ) . In addition , insulin c-peptide minimal model also use model pancreatic β-cell responsiveness oral glucose load hepatic insulin extraction .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Indvidiuals meet follow criterion eligible participation study : 1 . Male female patient age 18 65 year age . 2 . Ability provide write informed consent . 3 . Cognitively medically stable able comply procedure study protocol . For individual mitochondrial disease : Clinical history consistent diagnosis mitochondrial disease , molecular genetic diagnosis . To ensure consistency trial perform mitochondrial disease , investigator also ensure participant meet set previously publish criterion . These include clinical feature consistent primary mitochondrial disease molecular genetic proof pathogenic mutation mtDNA nDNA gene know associated dysfunction complex IV respiratory chain . Specifically , eligible participant must define mtDNA nDNA mutation affect subunit assembly complex associate known clinical/pathological feature , chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia ( CPEO ) , KearnsSayre , mitochondrial encephalomyopathy , lactic acidosis strokelike episode ( MELAS ) , mitochondrial encephalopathy rag red fiber ( MERRF ) , neuropathy , ataxia retinitis pigmentosa ( NARP ) Leigh syndrome ( 45 ) . Investigators explicitly include individual Friedreich 's Ataxia ( 46 ) , mutation mitochondrial protein frataxin , mutation respiratory chain complex II protein , succinate dehydrogenase ( SDH ) . For normal weight participant : BMI &lt; 25 kg/m2 . These matched subject mitochondrial disease age , sex , estrogen status ( woman ) , usual selfreported physical activity ( either sedentary , i.e. , sedentary , less 30 minute moderate physical activity 5 day per week , vigorous physical activity 20 minute 3 day per week ) . For obese participant : BMI &gt; 30 kg/m2 . These matched subject mitochondrial disease age , sex , estrogen status ( woman ) , usual selfreported physical activity ( either sedentary , i.e. , sedentary , less 30 minute moderate physical activity 5 day per week , vigorous physical activity 20 minute 3 day per week ) . For study group ( i.e. , mitochondrial disease , normal weight , obese ) : 1 . Diabetes ( HgbA1c &gt; 6.4 % ) and/or take insulin antidiabetic drug therapy within 4 week prior enrollment . 2 .
