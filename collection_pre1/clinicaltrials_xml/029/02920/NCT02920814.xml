	<brief_summary>The aim project determine effectiveness time intensive form Cognitive Behavioural Therapy ( CBT ) Specific Phobia Vomiting ( SPOV ) . Current research show brief format effective specific phobia e.g . insect animal . However , date limit research conduct effectiveness time intensive form CBT SPOV . A single case experimental design use analyse specific idiosyncratic outcome measure 6-8 case SPOV , refer Centre Anxiety Disorders Trauma ( CADAT ) treatment . Specifically , project explore effectiveness CBT deliver time-intensive format imagery rescripting element treatment . This initial study provide important information element CBT effective reducing target symptom whether symptom reduction achieve short number session . It represent crucial step format CBT rigorously evaluate compare treatment approach Randomised Controlled Trial .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Design A single case experimental design ( ABACADA ) use . A , B , C etc represent point intervention clinical contact participant standardise outcome measure administer treat clinician session . Phases A1 , A2 , A3 represent time contact participant undertake daily monitoring idiosyncratic symptom Visual Analogue Scales ( VAS ) e.g . degree avoidance , degree worry , degree nausea etc , change phase across time measure . Participants randomly allocate differ lengths baseline phase ( initial clinical assessment first clinical session ) 4 potential arm ( 7 , 10 , 14 , 17 day ) . The first three clinical session ( formulation , imagery rescripting plan intensive day ) take place weekly last 1.5 hour . The two intensive day last 4 hour take place shortly plan session within day . Three additional follow session offer within 10 day intensive day ( 2 within one week , final session one week ) . Follow data collect phone post 3 , 6 12 month post intervention . Participants Participants recruit consecutive referral CADAT treatment SPOV . Clients diagnosis SPOV define Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders ( DSM-V ) main presenting problem . They draw CADAT wait list , necessary Improving Access Psychological Therapy ( IAPT ) service Southwark , Lambeth Lewisham . These case pick treated CADAT qualify clinician . Participants expect involved study 8 week treatment phase , 12 month follow data collect . Recruitment Consultant Psychiatrist team Centre Anxiety Disorders Trauma identify potential participant wait list CADAT meet inclusion criterion take part study . Potential participant ask would like participate initial clinical assessment . They provide information sheet opportunity ask question make decision give informed consent . Sample size It estimate 6-8 case sufficient single case experimental design demonstrate proof concept . This base previous study use similar design . Procedure Patients identified CADAT wait list meet study criterion ask assessment would like participate study . Those interested take part give information sheet , opportunity ask question make decision participation . They ask provide inform write consent sign consent form continue study procedure . Clinicians remind participant right withdraw study time , affect care right treatment usual . Participants receive time intensive form CBT SPOV . To ensure therapist adherence time intensive format treatment , separate treatment protocol provide part Standard Operating Procedures . This protocol follow : - Assessment sign consent form - Session 1 : Re-baseline &amp; Formulation ( include conversation early memory vomit ) - Session 2 : Imagery Rescripting early memory vomit - Session 3 : Planning Intensive Days - Intensive Day 1 - Intensive Day 2 - 3 short clinical follow session Standardised outcome measure collect baseline , intervention follow phase . Participants also ask collect daily idiosyncratic measure intervention phase . Participants randomly allocate differ lengths baseline time intervention 4 potential arm ( 7 day , 10 day 14 day 17 day ) . This do use simple spreadsheet Research Assistant CADAT . The baseline discussion around memory vomiting , imagery re-scripting treatment plan consist 1-1.5 hour session . Time intensive treatment consist two session 2 day ( 4 hour ) . Three additional follow session administer , 2 within 1 week intensive day third 1 week second follow session . The standardised outcome measure collect 3 , 6 12 month phone post .</detailed_description>
