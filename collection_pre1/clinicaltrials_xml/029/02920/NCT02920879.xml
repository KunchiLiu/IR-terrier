	<brief_summary>This study investigate airway effect PEEP maskventilation anesthesia induction . Four patient group ventilate different PEEP driving pressure evaluate time open airway start positive pressure maskventilation anesthesia induction .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Airway Effects PEEP During Anesthesia Induction .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The use continuous positive pressure ( CPAP/PEEP ) pre-oxygenation mask-ventilation patient undergoing anesthesia induction increase . Continuous positive pressure several respiratory benefit well-documented data spontaneously breathe patient intubated patient . However effect PEEP anesthetize patient mask-ventilation poorly investigate . In previous trial investigator conduct , PEEP-level 10 cmH2O mask ventilation anesthesia induction surprisingly delayed time alveolar ventilation compare ZEEP . In order investigate phenomenon , four group patient compare preoxygenation mask ventilation anesthesia induction . Each group consist 30 patient pre-oxygenated mask ventilate different CPAP/PEEP level different driving pressure . Time open airway measure number respiratory cycle detection CO2 capnograph .</detailed_description>
