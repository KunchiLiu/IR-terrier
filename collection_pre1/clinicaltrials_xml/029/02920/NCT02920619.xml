	<detailed_description>The purpose study develop computational method cross-comparison muscle composition measurement three laboratory ultrasound system . We propose cross-sectional study obtain ultrasound image select muscle Veteran participant . These data use develop conversion model system . Evaluation neuromuscular symptom muscle weakness fatigue crucial improving quality life among Veterans . These symptom may relate progressive change muscle tissue composition , include increase intramuscular fat atrophy . Quantitative musculoskeletal ultrasound diagnostic imaging application use characterize muscle tissue composition . Despite non-invasiveness relative low cost , quantitative musculoskeletal ultrasound widely adopt medical community due part technical barrier impede generalization measurement across ultrasound system . Unfortunately , technique propose reliably compare system measurement . Development new cross-comparison method could expand quantitative musculoskeletal ultrasound application improve neuromuscular symptom diagnosis .</detailed_description>
