	<detailed_description>Major depressive disorder severe psychiatric illness lifetime prevalence 8-16 % . Many patient fail achieve complete remission symptom antidepressant medication , 10 % patient chronically resistant several psychopharmacological treatment . Development alternative non-pharmacological treatment therefore essential improve patient care . Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) offer therapeutic potential context . Current protocols apply high-frequency rTMS leave dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) reverse increase alpha-band oscillatory activity cortical hypo-excitability patient depression . However , translation rTMS therapy routine clinical practice limit due low efficacy high inter-individual variability . This study aim optimize rTMS stimulation protocol MDD deterministically couple time TMS ongoing oscillatory neural activity underlie cortex measure real-time high-density surface EEG . It hypothesize alpha phase-locked rTMS leave DLPFC revers increase alpha-band oscillatory activity cortical hypo-excitability efficiently current open-loop rTMS protocol use treatment MDD .</detailed_description>
