	<brief_title>DetermInants Antimicrobial Use aNd De-escalAtion Critical Care ( DIANA )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite consensus regard spectrum timing antibiotic therapy , antimicrobial use varies across ICUs ; indeed important variation choice , dosing , method administration , duration antimicrobial therapy de-escalation empirical therapy . DetermInants Antimicrobial use aNd de-escalAtion critical care ( DIANA study ) , multicenter , international , prospective , observational cohort study , aim describe rate de-escalation well associate outcome empirical antibiotic therapy infection intensive care unit . Given explorative nature study require number patient calculate . The investigator aim include 2000 patient empirical antibiotic start . With estimate de-escalation rate 35 % , estimation include 700 patient de-escalation perform make would allow suitable multivariable analysis . For participate center center data collect detailed electronic Center Report Form . This complete per center . For participate center data 4 element collect : ICU-related data , microbiology laboratory practice , definition de-escalation use participate center local de-escalation practice , background resistance level . This prospective observational study patient include participate center 2-week period . For patient include study , data collect electronic Case Report Form . For included patient data 4 element collect : patient data ( demographic , underlie co-morbid condition , patient characteristic different time point ) , infection data ( clinical microbiological ) , treatment data ( antimicrobial therapy source control ) outcome data ( 28 day follow period ) National coordinator : National Coordinators appoint Steering Committee key role conduction study individual country leader project . Ethics committee approval : Ethics committee approval may vary country country . The national coordinator responsible obtain ethic committee approval require national level ( procedure similar ) . Informed consent obtain subject nominate representative ( applicable ) . As observational study country sit may waive need inform consent . Data management : All patient data collect anonymously enter electronic data capture system . Data provide local investigator primarily property ICU collect data . Local investigator shall access data enter central database.The server system host True ; True certify Lloyd 's Register Quality Assurance ( LRQA ) accord international information security norm ISO 27001:2013 . True provide service accordance NEN7510 norm information security healthcare . Data control : Local investigator may contact query case outlier , excessive miss value reason deem relevant primary investigator . Statistical analysis : Statistical analysis perform primary investigator use statistical software program assist expert statistician necessary .</detailed_description>

If initial antibiotic therapy consider inadequate another empirical scheme choose ICU admission , empirical antibiotic study . Causative pathogen susceptibility unidentified time initiation antibiotic therapy ( Gram stain result may know ) . Signed informed consent ( required local ethic committee ) .
