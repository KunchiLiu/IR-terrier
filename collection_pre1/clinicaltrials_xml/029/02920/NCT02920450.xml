	<detailed_description>Approximately 70 % patient unresectable non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) receive progress frontline chemotherapy eligible second line treatment . Any agent available frontline therapy use salvage setting , though erlotinib , docetaxel , pemetrexed ( non-squamous cell carcinoma ) FDA-approved salvage set base upon demonstrated survival benefit randomize phase III trial . All three appear roughly equivalent term clinical benefit , admittedly modest , response rate &lt; 10 % , clinical benefit rate approximately 50 % , overall survival approximately 6 month . Still , substantial number patient may benefit agent salvage treatment setting , thus critical identify patient stand benefit . The study consist two phase , Ib II . The phase Ib portion study dose escalation separate 3+3 cohort use escalate dos PF-05212384 . The phase II portion consist two stage Simon design . The dos paclitaxel ( 200 mg/m2 , Q21 day ) carboplatin ( AUC=6 , Q21 day ) adjust part study design . The dose PF-05212384 determine Phase Ib portion . The primary endpoint phase Ib portion protocol determine tolerable phase II dose PF-05212384 combination paclitaxel carboplatin . The primary endpoint phase II portion study determine objective response rate disease administration PF-05212384 combination paclitaxel carboplatin . A secondary endpoint study progression-free survival follow PF-05212384 therapy .</detailed_description>
