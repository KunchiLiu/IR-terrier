	<brief_title>Full Occlusal Rehabilitation Patients With Severe Tooth Wear Using Indirect Composite Restorations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Standard dental treatment provide patient severely worn dentition . Treatment base principle 'minimally invasive treatment technique ' . Main difference 'standard ' treatment protocol standard procedure place composite restoration fully digital workflow . In traditional workflow silicon impression make , dental technician produce ( indirect ) composite restoration hand . These restoration adhesively cement teeth dentist . In fully digital workflow , digital 3D-scans make use 3D LAVA scanner ( 3M ESPE ) . Based digital 3D-images digital wax-up make dental technician composite restoration ( uplays backing ) design digitally mill finally adhesively cement teeth dentist . An important benefit patient rehabilitation worn dentition . Functionality ( teeth less sensitive , improved chewing ability , good occlusal stability , etc ) aesthetic improve immediately finishing treatment . Moreover , estimate treatment time le ( estimate treatment time approx . 12hours ) traditional method use standard treatment protocol ( estimate treatment time approx . 18hours ) . Another potential benefit well control predictable result use 3D-images pre-designed computer simulation . A risk indirect composite resin restoration unknown survival rate compare indirect well direct application technique</detailed_description>
