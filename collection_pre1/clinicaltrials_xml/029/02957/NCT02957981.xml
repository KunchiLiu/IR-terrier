	<brief_title>The Genetic Education Men Trial : Web-Based Education vs. Standard Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aim 1 : Develop web-based intervention increase genetic counseling/testing uptake men high risk carry BRCA mutation . Aim 2 : Evaluate impact web-based intervention ( WI ) vs. usual care ( UC ) Aim 3 : Examine behavioral psychosocial impact BRCA test men BRCA family . Identification Recruitment Subjects . Participants recruit via Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center 's Familial Cancer Registry Non-therapeutic Subject Registry Shared Resource . These registry contain 800 female BRCA1/2 positive participant . In addition , investigator recontact participant prior trial consent recontacted future research . Female index case identify base vital status , recency contact , availability test report document positive BRCA1/2 status . Where available , pedigree also review . To protect privacy study participant , participant recruit female BRCA mutation carrier relative ( index patient ) provide contact information . The investigator identify adult female mutation carrier enrol Non-therapeutic Subject Registry Shared Resource , Familial Cancer Registry receive positive test result participant IRB 2004-133 provide consent contacted future research study . The study staff mail study invitation potentially eligible index case . This mail include : introductory letter ; inform consent document ; HIPAA Authorization form ; study brochures distribution male relative desire ; family contact form request contact information current age potentially eligible male relative . The investigator request index patient return Family Contact Form self-addressed stamp envelope complete electronic version form . Consistent prior research Institutional Review Board guidance , letter Family Contact Form reiterate index patient request permission potentially eligible male relative ( ) prior provide contact information u , index patient 's signature Family Contact Form attest . The packet also contain information woman may decline participation ( opt-out post card ) .

Upon receive return Family Contact Forms , research team contact potentially eligible male relative mail . The study packet send include : introductory letter ; inform consent document ; study brochure , opt-out postcard . On opt-out contact , men also indicate ineligible study due cancer diagnosis prior genetic counseling/testing . Baseline survey . The baseline survey complete via telephone electronically . Two week follow mailing , researcher contact eligible men opt email telephone . For email contact , investigator send email link electronic study consent baseline survey . If email address provide , research assistant contact participant telephone . If participant already return print inform consent document , research assistant answer question study proceed baseline survey . If participant return informed consent document , research assistant complete verbal consent process administer baseline survey . Randomization . Following completion baseline survey , research assistant randomize participant either Web Intervention Usual Care . Randomization achieve via computer generate random number ( block 8 ) . Family member assign intervention avoid contamination . Men complete baseline survey online notify randomization assignment via email . Men complete baseline survey telephone notify randomization status end baseline survey . Usual Care Group . Men randomize Usual Care arm receive email letter inform group assignment . These contact include list resource men hereditary cancer family previously complete print electronic consent form , another copy print consent link electronic consent also provide . At time , Usual Care participant inform interested genetic counseling testing , contact study team ( via toll-free number provide letter ) schedule telephone genetic counseling session ( free charge ) study team provide local referral in-person genetic counseling . All participant require complete print electronic study consent form prior study-provided genetic counseling . Web Intervention Group . Men randomize Web Intervention receive email letter ( send US Mail ) web address , individualized code . When participant access website , ask enter email address code , choose password future log-ins . Participants forget password request new log-in code time . The investigator provide participant toll-free support number call question . Participants complete print electronic informed consent document require complete electronic consent prior view Web Intervention . At conclusion Web Intervention , participant provide follow option pursue genetic test familial BRCA1 BRCA2 mutation : 1 ) indicate interested pursuing genetic testing ; 2 ) indicate question genetic testing , case RA follow-up , answer process-related question , determine genetic counselor consultation require ; 3 ) schedule individual genetic counseling session ( LCCC genetic counselor genetic counselor choice ) ; 4 ) proceed directly genetic testing . Pre-Test Genetic counseling . All participant multiple option pre-test genetic counseling . Since Web Intervention provide participant content comparable standard pre-test genetic counseling , Web Intervention participant option proceed directly genetic test view intervention . However , since expect participant may prefer traditional genetic counseling , participant option free pre-test telephone genetic counseling provide study board-certified genetic counselor Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center . In contrast , Usual Care participant receive electronic genetic education/counseling , option proceed directly genetic testing . Usual Care participant interested pursue genetic counseling option receive free pre-test telephone genetic counseling study board certify genetic counselor Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center . After complete genetic counseling , participant provide opportunity proceed genetic testing . This arm design replicate standard care individual genetic counseling often proceed genetic test . Men either group prefer in-person genetic counseling , provide referral local counselor inform cost cover study . Men whose insurance company require see genetic counselor within specify organization test order informed requirement proceed test . Genetic testing . Genetic testing require part study . Any participant interested proceed genetic test receive standard clinical genetic test certify commercial laboratory . All test provide standard clinical protocol laboratory consent . The standard care relatives BRCA1 BRCA2 carrier test specific familial mutation . The familial mutation know study staff documentation test report must available female case , eligible participant study recruit . Men Ashkenazi Jewish background offer test three BRCA mutation common ethnic group , also standard clinical practice . Men option go insurance company pay pocket genetic testing . In either case , fee associate test pay directly clinical laboratory performs test . Coordination genetic testing . All participant indicate interested genetic test contact research assistant obtain information need insurance billing , pre-verification completion laboratory test requisition form . The research assistant provide laboratory consent form laboratory requisition form participant interested complete genetic testing . After complete sign form return u , research assistant send participant kit collect saliva ( DNA ) . The participant responsible mailing postage pay DNA kit require form directly test laboratory . Billing payment arrangement test handle test lab participant . Georgetown University bill patient genetic test service . Post-test genetic counseling .
