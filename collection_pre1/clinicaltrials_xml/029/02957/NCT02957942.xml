	<brief_summary>Focal dystonia neurological movement disorder characterize excessive involuntary muscle contraction body part . Spasmodic dysphonia ( SD ) type focal dystonia characterize excessive contraction intrinsic muscle larynx , lead difficulty speak affect effective communication . The cause SD unknown treatment produce long-term benefit . Previous study suggest SD focal dystonias associate decreased inhibition sensorimotor area brain . However , study investigate effect modulate excitability laryngeal motor cortex healthy individual SD . The goal pilot project determine brain excitability laryngeal motor cortex change low-frequency inhibitory repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) individual SD healthy control . Considering rTMS low frequency ( â‰¤1 Hz ) produce lasting inhibition brain , SD associate decreased cortical inhibition , purpose pilot study determine safety , feasibility response 1Hz rTMS laryngeal motor cortex individual SD healthy people . The result help understand change associate disorder , well contribute development future clinical intervention SD .</brief_summary>
