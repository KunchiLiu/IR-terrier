All participant follow minimum 6-8 week ( depend schedule follow-up visit center ) ask complete follow-up survey shortly schedule in-clinic appointment end study . Baseline follow-up questionnaire collect data quality life ( FACT-ES ) , health literacy , demographic . The web-based app use ask patient medication adherence previous 7 day , new symptom , change severity symptom .</detailed_description>
