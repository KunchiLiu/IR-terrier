	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate describe anatomical distribution sensory outcome follow LFCN block ( LFCN = lateral femoral cutaneous nerve ) relation incisional line Total Hip Arthroplasty ( THA ) . Furthermore , aim examine whether motorial outcome correspond Femoral nerve . The trial conduct healthy volunteer blind , randomize pair study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sensory Distribution Lateral Femoral Cutaneous Nerve Block</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Total hip arthroplasty may associate moderate intense postoperative pain . It essential pain treatment , besides analgesic , minimum side effect , especially opioid-related , order achieve low morbidity , high patient satisfaction encourage functional rehabilitation . Currently , `` gold standard '' pain treatment THA , exist large variety treatment option . Some patient undergone THA , difficult sufficiently treat conventional analgesic without reach additional morphine dos side effect unacceptable . It therefore important explore treatment option , include nerve blockade . Nerve block previously use THA operation , hamper fact , nerve block effect motorial nerve , inhibit early mobilization possibly increase tendency fall mobilize . LFCN purely sensorial therefore relieve patient pain without influence early mobilization . In addition , application nerve block easy virtually without complication . In two previous trial , investigator study effect LFCN block pain treatment THA . In recent study , LFCN block apply patient THA , still visual analogue scale ( VAS ) mobilization pain &gt; 40 mm lift leg stretch . The LFCN block alleviate significantly average pain group level . Meanwhile 42 % patient study limited effect block . The reason may due fact , LFCN block cover type pain THA , also fact , nerve innervation area individual difference anatomical distribution . It therefore relevant describe anatomical distribution LFCN block order determine whether variation anatomy contribute factor high number patient effect blockade . An early study investigate proportion incisional line associate total hip arthroplasty cover LFCN block . However study blind randomize , description anatomical distribution block inadequate . Methods : Prior apply nerve block , measurement method test baseline value register leg participant . The effect nerve block healthy individual study number validate measurement technique . These technique consist map affect anatomical area temperature discrimination test ( cold sensation ) use alcohol soak gauze pin-prick test use Von Frey filament , pain stimulation test determination heat pain threshold ( Heat Pain Detection Threshold , HPDT ) pain tonic heat-stimulation skin ( VAS tonic heat stimulation ) . The duration distribution sensory block thus evaluate high precision . It furthermore important investigate whether nerve blockade affect N. Femoralis ' motorial innervation test m.Quadriceps ' motorial function . Course study : 1 . Baseline value measure . 2 . An orthopedic surgeon draw two hypothetical incisional line correspond posterior anterior-lateral access hip joint leg participant . The incisional line draw UV paint visible UV light . No person draw line participant see line draw . 3 . An ultrasound guide LFCN block apply specialist anesthesia . Each trial participant get injection Ropivacaine ( active ingredient ) one leg injection isotonic NaCl ( placebo ) leg . Neither trial participant , doctor investigator know treatment participant receive leg , trial blind . 4 . After LFCN block apply line call `` Line A '' drawn leg . Line A go trochanter major femoral lateral epicondyle extend cranial . A line 0A drawn perpendicular line A trochanter major point . 5 cm line 0A , line -1A drawn -3A , 5 cm line 0A line 1A drawn , forth line 15A reach . 5 . One hour nerve block apply right leg , motorial sensorial test carry leg , outcome register documented photography . The test carry right leg leave leg follow order : - Maximum isometric voluntary contraction - Temperature discrimination test ( alcohol soak gauze ) - Pin-prick ( Von Frey filament ) - Photo documentation - Drawing incisional line UV-light - Photo documentation - Measurement incisional line - Heat pain detection threshold test - Pain stimulation test . The subject monitor blood pressure , pulse oximetry ECG trial . The study extend participant introductory conversation test complete .</detailed_description>
