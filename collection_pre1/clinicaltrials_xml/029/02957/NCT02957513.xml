	<brief_summary>The overall goal study compare well motivational message ( text message doctor 's office ) , diabetes health coach , enhance usual care diabetes education material ( provided doctor 's office ) work help African-American adult uncontrolled diabetes improve diabetes self-care decision . Self-care difficult diabetes , especially patient medical condition , diabetes uncontrolled , live area without many primary care doctor . Many study show encouraging text message doctor 's office health coach help people take good care . But primary care clinic around country start try send text , hire health coach , provide additional educational material critical know approach likely help . This study assign African-American diabetic either text message , health coach , enhance care find one work well . The investigator especially want find one work well people high risk . Lastly , investigator want find message coach help people improve blood sugar , quality life , feeling primary care . The study test message , coach , enhance care side side primary care doctor ' office . The message coaching program give patient pretty much information , different way . The text message write carefully base patient 's needs interest . The coach train help people get motivate work reach health goal . This study include 1000 African-American adult , age 35-75 , uncontrolled diabetes one additional chronic condition , live medically underserved community . People cell phone smart phone texting capability able use participate . 400 participant get message , 400 get coach , 200 receive enhance care . The investigator able tell message coach work see people improve diabetes self-care decision , blood sugar , quality life , feeling primary care get well . The long-term study goal get primary care clinic country start use motivational message health coach work well .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Significance : There critical need determine comparative effectiveness text messaging ( TM ) health coaching ( HC ) among African-Americans uncontrolled diabetes multiple chronic condition live medically underserved area ( MUA ) identify modality yield great improvement diabetes self-care at-risk urban rural subpopulation . Although numerous recent study demonstrate effectiveness either TM HC improve diabetes chronic disease self-care behavior , knowledge investigator information available regard comparative effectiveness modality urban rural subgroup . Prevalence diabetes , related comorbidities , poverty , obesity , food insecurity , tobacco use high rural area compare urban . Moreover , rural area struggle address need low access transportation , primary care , specialty care , diabetes education , mental health resource . However , urban living unique set problems—including increase stress fear one 's physical safety—that may impact comparative effectiveness HC TM . Although HC study show effectiveness intervention either rural urban area , HC study investigator aware specifically examine difference U.S. rural urban participant regard engagement rate clinical outcome health coach intervention . Similarly , telemedicine mobile health approach particularly advocate rural population yet little evidence support comparative benefit . The lack comparative effectiveness text message health coach diabetes self-care vulnerable urban rural subgroup represent critical gap research study design directly address . The study compare strategy enhance usual care ( EC ) diabetes educational material . Study Aims : As result , research use pragmatic randomize trial determine comparative effectiveness patient-driven TM versus HC versus EC African-American adult uncontrolled diabetes multiple chronic condition MUA emphasis identify quantify important interaction key baseline characteristic treatment arm . Specific aim include : Aim 1-Quantify effectiveness TM , HC , EC improve primary outcome measure ( diabetes self-care activity relate general diet , exercise medication adherence ) ; Aim 2-Determine contribution six key , baseline patient characteristic : 1 ) urban vs. rural residence , 2 ) health literacy , 3 ) medical complexity , 4 ) social complexity , 5 ) smart vs. cell phone ownership , 6 ) age , comparative effectiveness TM , HC , EC ; Aim 3-Quantify effectiveness TM , HC , EC improve secondary outcome average blood sugar , quality life , primary care engagement . The long-term objective disseminate foster implementation result research MUA nationwide improve critical self-care support primary care vulnerable population . Overall study design : Pragmatic randomize clinical trial . Main component intervention comparator ( ) : The study test two critical strategy patient engagement may lead substantive improvement quality care outcomes important vulnerable patient diabetes : 1 ) patient-driven TM , 2 ) patient-driven HC . The two parallel primary care-based patient-driven study intervention ( i.e . TM HC ) design provide approximately content , two alternative delivery mechanism . TM incorporate supportive cognitive behavioral strategy encourage improve diabetes self-care decision tailor base participant demographic , health literacy , preference , treatment self-regulation , perceive competency report barrier self-care . Motivational interviewing focus HC aim meet participant individual HC session bi-monthly first 2 month ( Intensive Phase-4 session follow randomization ) follow monthly remain 8 month ( 12 session total ) provide support regard diet/weight loss , physical activity , medication adherence tailor accord patient-identified health goal . Both strategy compare EC diabetes educational material . Study population : For main comparative effectiveness analysis ( Aim 1 ) total sample size ( dropout ) N=800 40 % randomize TM arm ( N1=320 ) , 40 % HC arm ( N2=320 ) , 20 % EC arm ( N3 = 160 ) . Participants include African-American adult , age 35-75 , uncontrolled diabetes multiple chronic condition , live medically underserved community MidSouth cell phone smart phone texting capability complete two-week run-in period demonstrate responsiveness TM . Primary/secondary outcome : The primary outcome measure assess effectiveness include : three ( six total ) subscales revise Summary Diabetes Self-Care Activities questionnaire assess general diet , exercise , medication adherence . Secondary outcome include : diabetes-specific quality life use Diabetes-39 , primary care engagement use National Health Interview Survey question regard delayed need care , average blood sugar ( A1c ) obtain medical record report DWPC-R. Analytic method : For Aim 1 , context repeat measure ANOVA , use t-tests within arm detect change baseline 12-months ( Follow-up 3 ) , power exceeds 0.99 primary outcome . For Aim 2 , six analysis assess heterogeneity treatment effect evaluate interaction key , dichotomize , baseline characteristic treatment arm , estimate mean standard error six subclass , within characteristic ( e.g . low high health literacy ) test difference TM HC , TM EC , HC TM . Analyses Aim 3 conduct described Aim 1 . With proposed sample size difference detect within either rural urban set two-sided test alpha 0.05 power 0.953 , 0.779 0.829 , respectively . Thus , rural urban subgroup adequate power detect meaningful difference effectiveness active arm EC arm . If arm combine , ignore rural urban setting , combine active arm &gt; .999 , .972 , .985 respectively .</detailed_description>
