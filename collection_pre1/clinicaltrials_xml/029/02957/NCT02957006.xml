	<brief_summary>Currently loop recorder diagnose arrhythmias send automatic alert physician base R R relationship . We believe arrhythmia diagnostics could improve accurate detection P T wave well QRS complex possible . There technique available long term outpatient monitor QT interval patient risk torsade de pointes receive QT prolong drug . We believe accurate T wave detection algorithm develop loop recorder could use monitor QT interval , perhaps even provide alert patient risk . The objective study see algorithm develop accurately define P T wave use data implantable loop recorder .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pilot Study 20 prospective cardiology patient loop recorder currently implant standard clinical indication . Eligible Subjects bring office John Wilson , MD Marshall Winner , MD . After informed consent obtain Hatton Research Staff follow performed : - subject initial loop recorder download USB flash drive - 12 lead EKG - Annotated QT interval 30 second rhythm strip - 24 hour Holter monitor place Hatton Research Staff order confirm loop recorder data . - Subjects instruct Holter monitor care use . - Subjects schedule come back office 24 hour return Holter monitor final loop recorder download complete . - Data loop recorder , Holter monitor , 12 lead EKG , 30 second rhythm strip download de-identified per Hatton Research Staff . - All de-identified data initial loop recorder download , 12 lead EKG , 30 second rhythm strip , final loop recorder download , Holter monitor send Medtronic algorithm development . Independent Variables : These variable include age race Dependent Variables : These variable include data loop recorder , 12 lead EKG , Holter monitor 30 second rhythm strip . Intervention experimental aspect study Subjects 12 lead EKG perform 30 second rhythm strip Subjects complete period 24 hour wear Holter monitor apply Hatton Research Staff . Statistical Analysis - Descriptive statistic ( mean , standard deviation ) calculate continuous variable . Continuous variable compare use Student 's - T test ANOVA appropriate . - Frequency percentage calculate categorical variable . - Categorical data compare use chi square Fisher 's Exact Test appropriate - Data variable assess Hatton Research Specialist</detailed_description>
