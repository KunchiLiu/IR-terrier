	<brief_summary>All patient await either leave atrial appendage closure ( LAA ) patent foramen ovale ( PFO ) Atrial Septal Defect ( ASD ) closure device part standard care identify review cardiology clinic . These patient place wait list undergo procedure . Patient-participants consent date admission device closure implantation . The study recruit 20 patient divide into; 10 patient undergoing PFO/ASD closure 10 patient undergoing LAA closure . EPC measure day device implantation , day 0 prior discharge day 1 . Patient participant admit overnight device closure implantation . Then subsequent patient cardiology research clinic follow appointment day ( 3-4 ) ( 7-8 ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect EPCs Successful Cardiac Occlusion Device Implantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective study assess effect , , EPC count cardiac device implantation . All patient await LAA PFO/ASD occlusion firstly review cardiology clinic assess . Suitable patient place wait list occlusion device implantation therefore identify potential participant study . Patient-participants informed trial give chance participate , may face face via invitation letter . All patient-participants give copy patient information sheet . Formal consent participate trial occur morning procedure . This avoid repeat visit patient may travel considerable distance . The study recruit 20 patient divide into; 10 patient undergoing PFO/ASD occlusion 10 patient undergoing LAA occlusion . EPC measure day device implantation , day 0 prior discharge day 1 , subsequent follow appointment day ( 3-4 ) ( 7-8 ) . Blood sample 3-5ml take allow flow cytometric analysis EPCs . Standard follow participant may include transesophageal echocardiography ( TOE ) 3 month implantation . This give direct assessment device relate thrombus . Currently TOE standard care PFO follow . If TOE result available either group investigator use result study .</detailed_description>
