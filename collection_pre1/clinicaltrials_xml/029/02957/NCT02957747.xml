	<brief_summary>Lifetime sexual trauma ( ST ) ( i.e. , behavior range unwanted sexual touching attempt complete rape ) significant social public health problem among woman Veterans . For woman Veterans , lifetime ST occur prior , military service . ST associate multiple difficulty risk , include posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , intimate partner violence ( IPV ) , alcohol misuse . Providing effective , integrate , low-cost intervention target ST-related risk woman Veterans lifetime ST would advance clinical care vulnerable woman . This research develop assess computer-delivered intervention ( Safety Health Experiences Program ; SHE ) provide screen brief behavior intervention woman Veterans lifetime ST. More specifically , intervention , SHE , address interrelated health concern woman Veterans ST ( i.e . alcohol misuse , IPV , PTSD ) . SHE design provide individualize assessment , feedback , referral woman Veterans lifetime ST. SHE take place within primary care set . Primary care visit frequent point health care contact woman Veterans make visit ideal , possibly , opportunity provide behavioral intervention . This study lay groundwork large clinical trial SHE program multiple VA primary care setting . If effective , intervention , SHE , represent innovative low cost service early identification intervention could implement nationwide ease speed address need woman Veterans lifetime ST . The long-term goal project make significant impact advance health service research introduce test novel potentially powerful service tool may improve service delivery address co-occurring health concern woman Veterans lifetime ST .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Addressing Health Concerns VA Women With Sexual Trauma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The VA Women 's Health Research Agenda underscore importance improve safety health outcome return Veteran woman . With great number woman join military , need gender-specific VA-based intervention increasingly important . Posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , intimate partner violence ( IPV ) , alcohol use closely interrelated significant concern woman Veterans history sexual trauma ( ST ) . Given screen military sexual trauma ( MST ) mandate within VAs , computer deliver intervention potential easily integrate standard care woman screen positive MST and/or lifetime STs , increase identification high-risk woman Veterans . This intervention provide computer-based intervention VA issue laptop could improve delivery service fill healthcare gap vulnerable Veteran population . The long-term goal project make significant impact advance health service research introduce test novel potentially powerful service tool may improve service delivery address co-occurring health concern VA woman lifetime ST . The intervention , Safe Healthy Experiences ( SHE ) , brief modular , computer-based intervention , target interrelated health risk woman Veterans lifetime ST ( i.e . alcohol misuse , IPV , PTSD ) . SHE provide individualized assessment , feedback , referral woman Veterans lifetime ST . The intervention base motivational interviewing ( MI ) , well-defined intervention strategy yield particularly promising result range clinical issue , include interpersonal violence , range patient population , include male female Veterans . MI collaborative non-confrontational approach emphasize increase participant 's awareness successful step towards well-being . MI consistent empowerment model , highly recommend intervention model victimized woman MI empowerment model converge important principle intervene victimized woman . Findings study provide necessary groundwork examine efficacy SHE future , large clinical trial . If SHE intervention find feasible , acceptable efficacious improve outcome woman Veterans lifetime ST , ultimate goal would program integrate clinical care widely disseminate . There two phase research direct toward aim : 1 ) develop refine integrate screen behavior intervention VA woman lifetime ST brief modular computer-based format administer VA primary care setting , 2 ) collect data feasibility , acceptability , initial efficacy intervention improve health VA woman , increase utilization treatment resource . The study aim : 1 . Develop preliminary computer-based intervention , incorporate information gain informant interview . 2 . Perform small open trial ( n = 20 ) SHE assess feasibility recruitment target population acceptability intervention study procedure . 3 . Conduct initial randomize control trial sample 150 woman Veterans screen positive lifetime sexual trauma ( ST ) least one risk factor ( i.e. , screen positive intimate partner violence ( IPV ) , posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , and/or heavy drinking ) demonstrate feasibility SHE acceptability SHE via participant report ease use , helpfulness , overall satisfaction . 4 . Examine preliminary evidence hypothesis , relative control condition , screen referral ( SR ) , SHE result : - Decreases number risk ( i.e. , heavy drinking ( 4+ drink one occasion ) , screen positive PTSD , screen positive IPV ) 2- 4-month follow-up ( primary ) . - Increases resource treatment utilization 2- 4-month follow-up period ( secondary ) . The data use demonstrate whether effect intervention look promise support future large-scale randomize control trial suggest , concert result clinical trial relate field , range effect size would reasonable expect future trial . This multi-site study . At Providence , RI base site ( Women Infants Hospital Brown University ) , specialize computer-based assessment interactive intervention session develop design staff member also assist data management . The Central Texas VA Healthcare System site data collection site main site participant recruiting , consent , enrollment , intervention follow-up .
