	<brief_summary>This project focus develop specific sensitive detector biomarker-based signature associate diagnosed recurrent bladder cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Molecular Biosensors Detection Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The focus research discover urinary biomarker ( ) distinct bladder cancer , develop molecular sensor detect urinary anomaly . By apply vitro selection technique , entity ( biomarker discovery sensor development ) do simultaneously . All patient bladder cancer diagnosis undergo transurethral resection bladder tumor ( TURBT ) , surveillance bladder cancer patient present microscopic visible ( gross ) hematuria invite participate study . Patients undergo standard care evaluation previously describe ( upper urinary tract imaging , cystouretheroscopy urine test urinalysis , culture cytology ) . Urine sample ( 10 mL ) study collect prior initial cystoscopy and/or TURBT . The specimen barcoded tracked UC Irvine Health software . Barcode encode ensure identity patient his/her clinical outcome available researcher blind trial . Patients involve study provide urine fundamental science research ; beyond , standard care provide patient . With respect collect urine , use medium phage aptamer production vitro fashion . The generated molecular probe use assess elucidate biomarkers present individual bladder cancer . 100 patient monitored bladder cancer experimental group test electro-phage aptamer approach follow bladder cancer biomarkers . Additionally , 100 patient treated hematuria provide negative control provide data test biomarkers patient treated disease .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients â‰¥18 year old Patients diagnose bladder cancer , undergo transurethral resection bladder tumor ( TRUBT ) , surveillance ( within 2 year ) recurrent bladder cancer Patients microscopic macroscopic hematuria Willing able consent Patients &lt; 18 year old Patients able give consent study Patients urinary diversion Patients recent percutaneous endoscopic procedure upper tract diseases stone condition Patients ureteral stent place upper urinary tract obstruction Patients recent trauma kidney , bladder perineal area , may cause hematuria Minors exclude study ureteral stent placement usually perform adult patient . Additionally , minor treat CHOC Hospital , UCIMC . Women pregnant exclude study since surgical treatment typically perform pregnant woman . Watchful wait preferred approach pregnant woman . Furthermore , research directly benefit pregnant woman fetus , biomedical knowledge obtain use subject pregnant . Therefore , per federal regulation , pregnant woman exclude study .</criteria>
