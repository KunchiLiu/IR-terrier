	<brief_title>Neurofeedback Patients With Frontal Brain Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aim study : Patients frontal brain lesion often suffer deficit brain function like attention , concentration , planning , impulse control emotional stability . In study investigator would like test , whether neurofeedback non-medication option help improve cognitive function . Neurofeedback method optimization stabilization brain activity . The brain continuously get computer-based information state . This information use brain self-regulation . Because neurofeedback process base learning , positive effect integrate daily life seem persist also train stop . From literature , several study show promising result neurofeedback therapy patient brain injury , study far fulfill scientific criterion prove benefit . Methods : The selection potential study participant make senior chief physician . Totally , include 20 patient newly acquire frontal brain lesion . 10 patient receive normal neurofeedback training 10 patient receive placebo-neurofeedback randomize , double blind manner . In total , 20 neurofeedback session conduct . At begin , 10 session end intervention time , neuropsychological assessment perform test main cognitive function frontal brain . Data analysis : The performance neuropsychological test primary outcome . We expect participant gain performance course study due natural brain recovery , focus difference improvement two group ( neurofeedback placebo-group ) .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Inclusion criterion : Middle severe frontal frontotemporal brain injury due accident , bleed ischemia , assess Initial GlascowComaScale 3 12 .
