	<brief_title>Dairy Intake Cerebral Antioxidant Defense Aging : Dietary Intervention Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eating dairy food may improve brain health people age increase brain 's natural defense protect nerve cell chemical stress . Researchers think may relationship brain 's natural defense system amount dairy food intake . Strengthening defense could provide beneficial protection brain neurodegenerative age-related disease cognitive decline . Glutathione ( GSH ) metabolite human brain protective system . It play key role protect cell oxidative stress , one major process contribute age neurodegeneration . Preliminary finding suggest may correlation dairy food intake GSH level age brain . Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy ( MRS ) measure chemical brain . It noninvasive measure effect dairy food intake major protective metabolite level live human brain aging . This study involve use MRI special MRS scan see adequate dairy food intake may aid enhance cerebral protective capacity fight age-related disease cognitive decline brain . Participants ask make total six visit research site . Participation last 3 month .</detailed_description>
