	<brief_title>Surveillance High-risk Early Postsurgical Patients Real-time Detection Complications</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Every year , approximately 1,500,000 surgical procedure perform The Netherlands alone . After major surgery , complication rate conservatively estimate 25 % , rate 15 % major complication . In patient , important problem failure timely detect develop complication failure adequately rescue patient . Currently , measurement vital sign standardize assessment patient wellbeing routinely perform intermittently every 8-12 hour , may lead failure detect patient complication . The aim study test hypothesis continuous wireless monitoring postsurgical ward improve patient outcome , measure disability-free survival three month surgery . Further , investigator hypothesize tight control regimen decrease length hospital stay treatment cost patient complication . The investigator carry study interventional , randomize ( per surgical ward ) , prospective , clinical trial ; participate ward include use stepped-wedge design . Primary outcome disability-free survival three month surgery .</detailed_description>
