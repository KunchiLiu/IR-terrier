	<detailed_description>Major depression recurrent debilitate mental disorder lifetime prevalence 20 % general population , among high psychiatric disorder . Its diagnosis base upon presence persist affective , cognitive behavioural symptom , depressive episode require least five symptom period least two week . When consider biological mechanism underpin depression , conclusive finding include deficit serotonergic ( 5-HT ) neurotransmission , alteration expression BDNF , deficient immune activation neuroinflammation , dysregulation hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA ) axis . Thus , understand pathophysiological mechanism MDD widespread implication development novel treatment prevention strategy . However , despite advancement development novel therapeutic , current treatment option reach optimal efficacy . Treatment resistant depression occur 40 % patient standard antidepressant medication variety undesirable side effect sedation , decrease blood pressure , increase weight , indigestion sexual dysfunction . This often result patient ' poor compliance result break-up medication recurrence depressive symptom increase suicidal risk . As unmet need develop safer effective treatment depression , major topic future psychiatric care focus different possible physiologically relevant mechanism order establish alternative , causative easy available treatment strategy . In past year , become increasingly evident resident gut bacteria important contributor healthy metabolism significant evidence link altered composition gut microbiota metabolic disorder obesity depression . Preclinical work animal report association alteration gut microbiome ( community microorganism live human gut ) anxiety-like behaviour , depressive-like symptom stress responsiveness . In line preclinical finding , recent study find altered composition faecal microbiota patient MDD . Most notably , MDD group increase level Enterobacteriaceae Alistipes reduce level Faecalibacterium , negatively correlate severity depressive symptom . Accumulating evidence suggest exit bi-directional communication system gastrointestinal tract brain . Changes gut microbiota influence cognitive emotional stress process interaction brain alter emotional state dysfunction gut microbiome-brain axis implicate stress-related disorder depression . Brain-gut interaction could occur various way : 1 ) microbial compound communicate via vagus nerve , connect brain digestive tract , 2 ) microbially derive metabolite interact immune system , maintain communication brain . Although pathway link gut bacteria brain incompletely understood , one principal mechanism propose underlie stress-induced alteration `` leaky gut '' phenomenon . Specifically , increase translocation bacterial product , due compromise gut barrier link activation immune system HPA axis . In line finding , human study demonstrate stress-induced increase bacterial translocation depression . The stress-induced interaction gut microbiome brain mediate via central process neurotransmission neurogenesis . For instance , substantial evidence demonstrate role gut commensal regulation development 5-HT system expression BDNF . Virtually corticolimbic brain structure involve mood regulation stress response express 5-HT receptor . These include prefrontal cortex , amygdala , hippocampus nucleus accumbens . A recent meta-analyses fMRI study support hyperactivation several region response fearful face MDD , extent correlate positively severity depressive symptom . Furthermore , rest state fMRI , MDD patient show low connectivity amydgala , hippocampus , parahippocampus , brainstem , connectivity strength inversely correlate general depression . The hippocampus , connection limbic , striatal PFC region , seem play key role stress regulation , give hippocampal neurogenesis mediates antidepressant effect via ventral hippocampus ' influence HPA axis , mechanisms antidepressant may reverse chronic stress-induced 5-HT neurogenic change . Notably , BDNF may contribute modulation neurogenesis response stress antidepressant , hippocampal BDNF level decrease response chronic stress increase response antidepressant treatment . Besides fundamental player eat process hypothalamic regulation energy balance , appetite-regulating hormone leptin ghrelin implicated etiology mood disorder . Importantly , particular specie bacteria gut know affect level leptin ghrelin . In human , onset depression associate combination high leptin level couple high visceral fat , link leptin level severity depressive symptom mediate adiposity . It suggest leptin might influence depression act leptin receptor present 5-HT neuron within raphe nuclei dopamine neuron midbrain , thus , might influence reward process . Consistent supposition , leptin receptor rat hippocampus genetically delete , stressor-induced depressive profile apparent , deletion leptin receptor midbrain dopamine neuron mice elicit elevated anxiety . Thus , identify key brain region mediate leptin 's antidepressant activity dissect intracellular signal transduction pathway may provide new insight pathogenesis depression facilitate development novel therapeutic strategy treatment illness . The gut peptide ghrelin also play fundamental role eat energy regulation indication ghrelin function might contribute depressive illness . Like leptin , ghrelin receptor report midbrain dorsal raphe nucleus associate reward process , well stressor-induced depressive-like symptom , anhedonia . In line role ghrelin stressor-elicited depression , negative event promote increase circulate ghrelin level emotionally reactive individual normalization ghrelin level stress may attenuate . Moreover , ghrelin elevate among depressed patient decline follow pharmacotherapy among patient respond treatment , ghrelin level higher among patient respond positively . Compelling preclinical data demonstrate beneficial effect probiotic normalize HPA axis functioning , BDNF level 5-HT neurotransmission . In particular , certain probiotic lactobacilli bifidobacteria reverse psychological stress-induced HPA axis activation posse antidepressant anxiolytic activity rat . A seminal work experimental animal show altered stress responsiveness partially reverse colonization gut . Importantly , recent innovative study show short-term consumption mostly animal mostly plant diet rapidly reproducibly alter human gut microbiome , suggest development dietary intervention may provide novel promise adjuvant therapy addition pharmacological antidepressant treatment MDD . Indeed , recent report trial administrate combination probiotic healthy subject demonstrate improvement depression anxiety outcome measure . Moreover , urinary free cortisol level significantly reduce probiotic , provide potential mechanism improvement psychological symptom observe . Consistent finding , study healthy subject find consumption probiotic-containing yogurt improve mood multispecies probiotic ( different strain lactobacilli bifidobacteria ) reduce rumination aggressive thought . Moreover , pioneer study healthy subject reveal use fMRI consumption probiotic bacteria ( include strain lactobacilli bifidobacteria ) ferment milk 4 week modulate brain activation corticolimbic region view frighten angry facial expression . Most important , recent study demonstrate administration probiotic , mixture lactobacillus bifidobacteria , ameliorate depressive symptom unmedicated patient mild moderate depression . These study together suggest restore disturb gut microbiome-brain interaction via probiotic bacteria might desirable treatment strategy depression , especially clinically depressed patient additionally suffer obesity , weight loss gain , appetite disturbance constipation . This project aim investigate first time probiotic supplementation improve effect antidepressant depressive symptom ( i.e . well fast remission ) patient severe MDD . Furthermore , study also test probiotic supplementation modulates immune signal inflammatory process , HPA axis response , neurogenesis , release appetite-regulating hormone , composition gut microbiota brain perfusion , structure activation change associate probiotic-induced effect depressive symptom .</detailed_description>
