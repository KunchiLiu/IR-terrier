	<detailed_description>Colonoscopy polypectomy reduces anticipate incidence colorectal malignancy patient significant adenomatous polyp approximately 80 % long term follow . Most endoscopists routinely perform removal small polyp . However , removal flat colonic neoplasia 20mm size large complex require specific endoscopic technique , one technique term wide field endoscopic mucosal resection ( WF-EMR ) . Traditionally lesion treat surgically significant expense healthcare system . Endoscopic treatment large colonic polyp reduce health care cost approximately $ 11,000 per patient treat , save bed day avoids surgery 90 % patient . EMR describe endoscopic technique treat colorectal adenomatous polyp submucosal lift careful piecemeal snare resection . This procedure show safe effective resecting lesion limit mucosa . Clearly importance predict lesion unlikely invade deep layer utmost importance , significant improvement ability ass make large volume centre Westmead An important longer-term complication EMR large flat colonic neoplasia phenomenon residual polyp tissue polyp recurrence , focus propose research study . Recurrence detect surveillance colonoscopy ( SC ) , perform define interval index procedure . Our current standard safe surveillance interval Westmead &gt; = 20mm EMR 5 month ( SC1 ) . In large study date , Australian Colonic EMR ( ACE ) study , recurrence SC1 stand 16.5 % patient . We recently come end randomise trial ( SCAR ) thermal treatment ( snare tip soft coagulation , STSC ) EMR defect margin ( SCAR technique ) , finding present Digestive Diseases Week San Diego . The result trial ( n=353 ) promise risk adenoma recurrence treat group 6.4 % vs 20.7 % non-treated group ( relative risk 0.3 , p &lt; .001 ) . There adverse event related treatment . We plan perform intervention patient propose study . In addition , increase evidence , scientific literature institution , identifiable factor initial EMR predict recurrence SC1 . Current data ACE cohort suggest increase size lesion ( &gt; =40mm ) , presence high grade dysplasia ( HGD ) resection specimen intra-procedural bleed require endoscopic control predict great likelihood recurrence . We create , submit publication , risk score recurrence EMR know Sydney EMR Recurrence Tool ( SERT ) , ( figure 1 ) . SERT create binomial logistic regression analysis ( figure 2 ) 692 patient ( model cohort ) ACE study validate remain 691 patient ( validation cohort ) undergone SC1 . Kaplan Meier curve ( figure 3 ) use determine predict incidence recurrence various point time EMR validation cohort ( figure 4 ) . The strength SERT lie predict absence recurrence , negative predictive value 92.6 % first surveillance colonoscopy . While score derive patient treated SCAR technique , expect stratification lesion SERT continue valid low overall rate . Crucial ensure absence polyp recurrence long term surveillance colonoscopy . In endoscopy department Westmead current standard follow-up SC1 5 month . This short interval costly inconvenient patient , think necessary due previous anxiety recurrence rate . We therefore propose study prospectively evaluate recurrence WF-EMR triaging follow base SERT , lesion treat SCAR technique . Patients SERT 0 lesion would triaged first follow 18 month ( usual time SC2 ) since rate recurrence point predict low ( 8.5 % ) recurrence likely easily treat endoscopically time ( validation cohort recurrence commonly diminutive ( &lt; 5mm , 67 % ) , uni-focal ( 75 % ) , high grade dysplasia ( HGD ) . All recurrence treatable endoscopically . This compare favourably 90.3 % successful endoscopic treatment recurrence rate recent meta-analysis . Higher risk lesion ( SERT 1-4 ) would triaged earlier follow 6 18 month , since predict risk recurrence 6 month 14.8 % 18 month 31.8 % . All lesion would require follow procedure approximately 36 month original EMR since group rate recurrence increase time ( figure 4 ) suggest refer specialist . Risk factor Score Laterally Spreading lesion Size &gt; = 40 , score 2 Intraprocedural bleed require endoscopic control , score 1 High grade dysplasia , score 1</detailed_description>
