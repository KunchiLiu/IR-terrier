	<brief_summary>Cardiovascular disease major cause morbidity mortality worldwide . There number risk factor coronary artery disease often patient admit acute coronary syndrome comorbidities . The main stay treatment patient perform coronary angiography require coronary angioplasty . Previous study show link endothelial progenitor cell ( EPC ) count , coronary artery disease statin therapy loading , however study exclude patient significant comorbidities therefore truly represent `` real life '' patient . This pilot study assess EPC response patient able undergo coronary intervention part normal clinical management current guideline regardless pre-existing comorbidities . The research team believe allow representation `` real world '' patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect EPCs Statin Loading `` All Comers '' With ACS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot study include 40 patient-participants admit coronary care unit Royal Stoke University Hospital large busy tertiary cardiac centre . Patient-participants assess , deem appropriate undergo coronary angiography angioplasty eligible enrolment study . Following standard care angiogram / angioplasty , patient-participants give minimum 3 hour consent ensure delay clinical treatment . A short information sheet give patient initially . If patient interested study , full participant information sheet give . If potential patient-participants consent study participation 3-5ml blood venesect sent EPC analysis . That late evening atorvastatin 80mg give per current national recommendation . Patient-participants venesection EPC analysis day 1-2 , 3-4 finally 7-8 . ACS patient usually hospital 3 4 day provide complication . It therefore anticipate day 0 , 1-2 3-4 venesection may perform whilst patient-participants within cardiology department . However outpatient cardiology research clinic follow arrange day 7-8 allow final venesection EPC analysis . This pilot study assess EPC response patient able undergo coronary intervention part normal clinical management current guideline regardless pre-existing comorbidities . The research team believe allow representation `` real world '' patient .</detailed_description>
