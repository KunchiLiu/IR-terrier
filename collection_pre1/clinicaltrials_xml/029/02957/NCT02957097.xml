	<detailed_description>Pain surgery significant acute clinical symptom . It associate quality post-operative recovery , time spent hospital , post-discharge care readmission , morbidity , psychosocial distress , cost care . The management acute postsurgical pain primarily consist multimodal approach consist opioids , non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) , acetaminophen , local anesthetic . The associated adverse effect often limit use multimodal pharmacotherapy . Opioids excellent analgesic property , however associate poor adverse-effects profile . They associate nausea , vomit , somnolence , urinary retention . Such adverse-effects may decrease quality post-operative recovery , increase patient post-surgical management , overall cost care . Moreover , patient undergo oral maxillofacial surgical procedure , adverse-effects may potentiate due placement reconstructive plate , screw , maxillomandibular fixation . In order improve post-surgical quality care , researcher look alternative modality management acute post-surgical pain . One modality use preemptive analgesic therapy . Preemptive analgesia define treatment modality initiate traumatic event , , surgical incision tissue manipulation introduce . Gabapentin antiepileptic drug use management painful neuropathy , , diabetic poly-neuropathy , post-herpetic neuralgia , trigeminal neuropathy . Gabapentin antiallodynic antihyperalgesic property minor effect normal nociception . It reduce hyperexcitability dorsal horn neuron induce tissue injury , well , central sensitization induce trauma surgery . Gabapentin study extensively preemptive analgesic various non-craniofacial surgery . In systemic review meta-analysis pre-operative administration gabapentin various surgical procedure , Tiippana et al report opioid-sparing effect first 24 h single dose gabapentin 300-1200 mg , administer 1-2 h preoperatively , range 20 % 62 % . Authors conclude combined effect single dose gabapentin reduction opioid consumption equivalent 30 +/- 4 mg morphine ( mean +/- 95 % confidence interval ) first 24 h surgery . In another meta-regression analysis author report gabapentin reduce opioid related adverse effect , nausea , vomit , urinary retention ( Numbers need treat ( NNT ) 25 , 6 , 7 , respectively ) . In systematic review meta-analysis , consist randomize controlled trial woman underwent total abdominal hysterectomy , general anesthesia , conclude preemptive administration gabapentin effective decrease postsurgical pain score , narcotic consumption , nausea vomit episode . Similar reduction postsurgical pain score , narcotic consumption , adverse effect see surgical procedure , , breast surgery , spinal surgery , orthopedic surgical procedure , amputation surgery . However , data available major oral maxillofacial surgical procedure Primary secondary aim follow : Primary aim : 1 . To determine difference intensity pain , post-operatively , 6 hour , 12 hour , 24 hour , 72 hour participant pre-operatively administer gabapentin versus pre-operatively administer placebo medication . 2 . To determine difference total opioid consumption 24 72 hour post-operatively , among participant pre-operatively administer gabapentin versus pre-operatively administer placebo medication . 3 . To evaluate difference time first rescue analgesic post-operatively , among participant pre-operatively administer gabapentin versus pre-operatively administer placebo medication . 4 . To determine difference incidence adverse effect within first 24 hour 72 hour post-operatively participant pre-operatively administer gabapentin versus pre-operatively administer placebo medication . Secondary aim : 1 . To determine difference incidence intensity pain 1 month post-operatively , among participant pre-operatively administer gabapentin versus pre-operatively administer placebo medication . 2 . To evaluate difference post-operative hospital-stay among participant pre-operatively administer gabapentin versus pre-operatively administer placebo medication . 3 . To evaluate influence history chronic pain disorder : 1 . The association intensity pain pre-emptive use gabapentin . 2 . The association opioid consumption pre-emptive use gabapentin . 3 . The difference time first rescue analgesic post-operatively , among participant pre-operatively administer gabapentin versus pre-operatively administer placebo medication . Hypothesis : 1 . Participants receive gabapentin 900 mg PO 3h pre-operatively significantly less pain 6 hour , 12 hour , 24 hour , 72 hour post-operatively compare receive placebo medication . 2 . Participants receive gabapentin 900 mg 3h pre-operatively significantly less total opioid consumption 24 72 hour post-operatively receive placebo medication . 3 . There significantly few incidence adverse event associate opioid consumption participant pre-emptive use gabapentin medication . 4 . The gabapentin group significantly long time first rescue medication compare placebo group . Study enrollment carry department Oral Maxillofacial Surgery ( OMFS ) , Massachusetts General Hospital , Boston , Massachusetts . Relevant patient go identify offer participate study . This take place history physical examination visit , conduct prior surgical procedure department OMFS . This double-blind investigation , randomize , placebo-controlled drug trial . Randomization treatment group carry hospital pharmacy use computer generate randomization template . Both investigator participant blind group allotment . The investigation primarily divide two section , medication phase surgical phase . In medication phase investigation , treatment group receive single dose Gabapentin 900mg 2-3h commencement surgery ( initial incision ) . Placebo group receive single dose placebo medication 2-3h pre-operatively ( commencement surgery ) . Both gabapentin placebo medication look similar shape , color , size . Hospital pharmacy recruit provide placebo gabapentin medication . Hospital pharmacy responsible deliver medication participant prior surgical procedure . During surgical phase study , participant undergo respective oral maxillofacial surgical procedure , general anesthesia . The surgical part investigation , way form , different usual standard care follow department oral maxillofacial surgery department , Massachusetts General Hospital . Peri-operative post-operative analgesic regimen also standardize per departmental guideline respective surgical procedure . Data collect consist follow : Prior undergoing surgical procedure 1 . Age , gender , past medical history , medical illness , past surgical history , past hospitalization history , psychosocial history , current medication , allergy . 2 . Graded chronic pain scale - 6 month 3 . McGill Pain-short questionnaire After surgical procedure 1 . Surgical characteristic , type surgery , surgeon perform surgery , complication surgery , duration surgery 2 . Pain score 11-point likert-type visual analog scale 6h , 12h , 24h , 72h , 1 month post-surgically . 3 . Opioid consumption 24h 72h post-operatively 4 . Vomiting/Nausea score 11-point likert-type visual analog scale 6h , 12h , 24h , 72h post-surgically . 5 . Opioid-related symptom distress scale 24h 72h , post-surgically 6 . Duration hospital stay 7 . Analgesic medication regimen 1 month post-operatively . All data collect 7 data collection point . Screening phase : Screening visit . Interested participant undergo screen evaluation . Participants explain study consent obtain . Participants willing participate also fill follow questionnaire : - Graded Chronic Pain Scale 6 month - McGill pain questionnaire Surgical phase : Baseline visit . Participants administer either single tablet gabapentin 900 mg placebo medication , 2-3 hour undergo surgical procedure . Follow-up phase : Follow-up 1 . It carry 6 hour post-surgically . Participant asked rate level pain , intensity nausea vomit 11-point likert type 0 10 scale , 0 indicative symptom 10 indicative worst symptom ever . In addition , information medical record regard characteristic surgical procedure ( type , surgeon , duration , complication ) collect . Follow-up 2 , 3 , 4 . Follow-up 2 , 3 , 4 carry post-operatively , 12 hour , 24 hour , 72 hour , respectively . Participant ask question step 3 . In addition participant use analgesic medication stay hospital record . Further , follow-up 3 4 ( 24 72 hour post-operative , respectively ) participant fill opioid-related symptom distress scale data type , dosage , quantity opioid medication consume collect . If participant leave hospital prior follow-up visit , contact via telephone . Follow-up 5 . These carry phone , 1 month post-surgically . Following data collect : 1 . Participants ask question McGill pain-short questionnaire opioid-related symptom distress scale . 2 . Intensity nausea and/or vomit 0 10 scale , 0 indicative nausea and/or vomit 10 indicative worst nausea/vomiting ever . 3 . List analgesic medication . All type opioid medication use investigation period management pain convert morphine sulphate PO equivalent 0 % cross-reactivity resistance . BIOSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS A total 100 participant go recruited present investigation . This number calculate use either effect size 25 % less consumption opioid medication , 25 % less pain score 6h post-operatively , alpha value 0.05 power 0.95 . However , 100 participant recruit 12 month , recruitment process terminate . A multistep analytic approach carry . In first step , participant ' demographic , clinical characteristic go compare among participant treatment placebo group , use t-tests ( non-parametric equivalent ) Chi-squared ( Fisher exact ) test appropriate . Next , use univariate multivariate logistic regression analyse go use determine efficacy drug .</detailed_description>
