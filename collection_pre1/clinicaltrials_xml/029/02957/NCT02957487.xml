	<brief_summary>The aim clinical study conduct dental specialty clinic Drammen , Norway assess clinical outcome patient edentate upper jaw treat removable full prosthesis support 3 implant restore function aesthetic . Clinical variable beyond implant dimension intraoral location , recall routine , maintenance need , patient satisfaction quality life , also appraise contrasted aim elucidate association clinical outcome . Specific evaluation do regard follow outcome criterion : - crestal bone level periodontal condition around implant - incidence rate biological , technical , traumatic failure / complication related implant - incidence rate biological , technical , mechanical , esthetic failures/complications prosthesis prosthetic component A secondary objective identify different risk factor biological failure / complication , include influence medical condition tobacco use .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Maxillary 3-implant Removable Prostheses Without Palatal Coverage Locator Abutments</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Materials Methods The protocol submit Research Ethics Board Northern Norway order obtain ethic approval prior commence study . All patient obtain invitation letter detail objective study request sign consent letter prior clinical examination accord principle good research practice . All patient offer free implant hygiene session prosthesis cleaning . Study population All patient treat private dental clinic Drammen , Norway receive maxillary removable full prosthesis support 3 dental implant invite attend evaluation intra-oral status annually implant installation solicit treatment satisfaction daily oral function . These patient initially offer maintenance care completion treatment . The implant use make titanium microrough surface ( Astra Tech Implant System , Dentsply Implants , Mølndal , Sweden ) . All implant place accord manufacturer 's instruction ( http : //www.dentsplyimplants.no/nb-NO/Implantatsystem/Prosedyrer/Treatment-planning ) fit precision attachment ( Locator , ZEST Anchors , Escondido , CA , USA . The removable prosthesis make heat cure poly-methyl-metacrylate ( PMMA ) incorporate three active matrix ) . Recall Procedure Each patient invite letter follow phone call attend examination visit . The patient complete questionnaire relate change general health aspect , experience satisfaction reconstruction eventual need repair session last year . Specifically , medical history smoke history ( e.g . pack/years ) assess . Recordings make general local factor may affect prognosis implant prosthesis . This include occurrence systemic disease since implant placement , regular medication use patient , smoke status , dental treatment receive since implant placement , recall frequency dental hygienist last dental examination appointment . Collection Data Patients ' Charts General information gather patient ' chart . Patients ' age , self-reported smoking habit number cigarette per day , medical history , medication intake , reason tooth loss date prosthesis insertion record `` patient 's summary form '' . Type distribution implant retrieve patient ' chart . Cases chart documentation incidence biological mechanical complication follow-up period closely review record follow : 1 . History implant loss ( Biological complication ) : Period service failure trace month lose implant . Lost implant categorize three group : 1 ) `` Early Failure '' refers implant lose insertion definite prosthesis . 2 ) `` One-year Failure '' address implant fail within first year loading . 3 ) `` Late Failure '' include implant lose one year follow insertion final prosthesis ( Roos-Jansåker et al 2006 ) . 2 . History peri-implant mucositis peri-implantitis ( biological complication ) : Any recorded incidence inflammation suppuration relate gingival tissue surround implant patient ' chart gather transfer `` patient ' summary form '' . 3 . History various technical problem encounter follow insertion removable prosthesis ( mechanical complication ) : Any history mechanical complication attachment loosening/fracture incidence crack , chipping fracture resin teeth , acrylic body prosthesis record `` patient ' summary form '' . Post-operation peri-apical radiograph , take day `` stage-one '' surgery , retrieve patient 's chart use reference point support bone level implant . Reference bone level mesial distal side determine measure distance implant platform apical point alveolar crestal bone surround implant . A mean value mesial distal side use implant reference marginal bone level .</detailed_description>
