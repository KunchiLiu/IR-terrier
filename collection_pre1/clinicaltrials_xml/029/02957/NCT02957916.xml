	<detailed_description>Obesity epidemic effect pediatric population . Currently , 17 % child classify obese 32 % overweight . Many child develop complication include type 2 diabetes , dyslipidemia , hypertension hepatic steatosis . Obesity global epidemic lack effective treatment option . Obesity many underlying cause include genetic predisposition environmental factor . Understanding genetic basis obesity may allow precisely targeted intervention include specific dietary plan pharmacologic treatment . The common cause genetic obesity haploinsufficiency melanocortin-4 receptor ( MC4R ) . In obese adult cohort , prevalence pathogenic MC4R mutation 1-2 % . Commercial test available many obesity syndrome , cost high charge always cover insurance . Clinicians little motivation test patient MC4R mutation treatment available clear genetic testing result change patient behavior . This particular lab group work develop novel pharmacologic treatment obesity syndrome , MC4R deficiency . In order well understand early onset obesity identify patient interested future research study , include clinical trial , investigator aim develop registry patient early onset obesity .</detailed_description>
