	<brief_summary>This study evaluate immunogenicity add inactivated influenza vaccine southern hemisphere ( SH ) formulation standard once-annual influenza vaccination northern hemisphere ( NH ) formulation old adult Hong Kong 5 year . Half participant receive twice-annual influenza vaccination NH SH formulation , half receive once-annual influenza vaccination NH formulation placebo .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immunogenicity Twice-annual Influenza Vaccination Older Adults Hong Kong</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Hong Kong locate subtropical region two seasonal peak influenza transmission . North Hemisphere seasonal influenza vaccine usually available vaccination general public start October every year anticipate winter peak start December Hong Kong , presumably also provide protection prevail strain summer peak start around July next year . However , influenza vaccine may poorer efficacy effectiveness old adult . The investigator hypothesize subtropical tropical location prolong circulation influenza virus , include emergence new strain different time year , twice-annual vaccination late available strain could provide best protection . Aim : To test immune profile time old adult follow twice-annual influenza vaccination receive once-annual influenza vaccination . Design subject : A 5-year immunogenicity study randomize placebo-controlled design among 400 old adult age 70-79 year . The investigator enroll participant general community attend general outpatient clinic influenza vaccination medical preventive care visit . Eligible individual randomly allocate equal proportion two intervention group ( I : once-annual standard inactivate influenza vaccine ; II : twice-annual standard inactivate influenza vaccine ) consist ten round vaccination designate intervention group winter/summer influenza season follow throughout 5 year . Before summer influenza season group II receive inactivate influenza vaccine southern hemisphere formulation group receive saline placebo . For round vaccination ( placebo ) , blood sample immunological test collect administration 30 day administration among participant , 7 , 30 91 day administration subset 25 % participant . Acute illness among participant monitor active surveillance influenza season . The vaccine formulation round vaccination update season accord WHO recommendation . Main outcome measure : Antibody titre measure haemagglutination-inhibition assay , establish correlate protection , addition measurement humoral cell-mediated immune response two intervention group 5 year .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adult age 7079 year attend GOPCs , DECCs day care centre receive influenza vaccination medical preventive care visit . Individuals show sign dementia ( either confirm medical record pas Minicog test ) significant cognitive impairment competent give consent . Individuals report medical condition suitable receive inactivate influenza vaccine , : Severe allergic reaction ( e.g. , anaphylaxis ) previous dose influenza vaccine ; vaccine component , include egg protein ; Moderate severe acute illness without fever previous influenza vaccination ; A history GuillainBarr√© syndrome ( GBS ) within 6 week previous influenza vaccination . Individuals , accord medical record , report medical condition suitable receive intramuscular injection , : bleeding disorder habitually take anticoagulant ( exception antiplatelets aspirin ) . Individuals medical condition suitable receive inactivate influenza vaccine determine clinician .</criteria>
