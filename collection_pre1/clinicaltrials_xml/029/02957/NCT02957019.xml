	<brief_title>A Phase I/II Study Tumor-targeting Human L19-IL2 Monoclonal Antibody-cytokine Fusion Protein Combination With Rituximab Relapsed Refractory Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma ( DLBCL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase I - Dose definition : A prospective , open-label , multi-center Phase I dose escalation study cohort 3-6 patient receive escalate dos L19-IL2 combination fix dose Rituximab ( 375 mg/m2 ) . Phase II - Activity Evaluation : Open-label , multi-center , prospective study 14 enrol patient receive fix dose Rituximab ( 375 mg/m2 ) combination L19-IL2 RD define Phase I part study . The study design establish whether L19-IL2 , administer combination Rituximab well tolerate achieve objective response clinical benefit patient relapse refractory DLBCL .</detailed_description>
