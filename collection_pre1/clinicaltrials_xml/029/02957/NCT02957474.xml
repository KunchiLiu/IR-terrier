	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Effect Food , Formulation Strength , Proton Pump Inhibitor GED 0301 Pharmacokinetics Healthy Adult Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects consent screen within 21 day dose . They undergo routine screening procedure include physical examination ( PE ) , 12 lead electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) , vital sign measurement , clinical laboratory safety test ( clinical chemistry , haematology , urinalysis ) , pregnancy test female , serology/drug/alcohol screen . Eligible subject return clinic site Day -1 baseline safety assessment . After overnight fast least 10 hour , subject assign randomly one six treatment sequence determine fast status order treatment administer . Subjects fast arm receive either single 160 mg tablet GED 0301 four 40 mg tablet GED 0301 , approximately 240 mL room temperature , non-carbonated water . Subjects fed arm require fast overnight least 10 hour . On morning dosing , subject serve high-fat meal . The meal entirely consume within 20 minute serve . Dosing single160 mg tablet GED 0301 occur within 30 minute ( ± 5 minute ) start meal . During fourth period , subject receive daily oral dos 40 mg omeprazole 6 day ( Days 10 16 ) . Subjects fast even fourth day least 10 hour prior receive last treatment , single dose 160 mg GED 0301 together one 40 mg oral dose omeprazole ( Day 15 ) . On Day 16 , subject take last dose omeprazole . Serial blood sample determination GED 0301 level plasma perform period 48 hour post dose . Subjects domicile clinic site Day 1 Period 1 Day 17 . All subject discharge clinic site Day 17 require safety PK procedure complete . A follow phone call occur five day ( ± 1 day ) discharge clinic center . The study conduct compliance Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) , describe International Conference Harmonisation ( ICH ) Guideline E6 accordance general ethical principle outline Declaration Helsinki . The study receive approval EC prior commencement . The Investigator conduct aspect study accordance applicable national , state , local law pertinent regulatory authority .</detailed_description>
