	<brief_summary>Nearly 2 10 woman sustain distal forearm fracture throughout lifespan.Recent longitudinal study illustrate many 1/3 person undergo closed reduction cast distal radius fracture ( DRF ) go develop type 1 complex regional pain syndrome ( CRPS ) . Graded motor imagery ( i.e. , motor imagery mirror therapy ) , movement representation technique , strongly support literature treatment CRPS recently suggest potential strategy prevent onset . Other complication include disability , wrist/forearm tightness sensorimotor change . The investigator propose early intervention protocol include graded motor imagery ( GMI ) improve pain , functional upper limb sensorimotor outcomes person follow closed reduction cast DRF relative standard care intervention .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Graded Motor Imagery Women Risk Developing Type I CRPS Following Closed Treatment Distal Radius Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Distal radius fracture ( DRF ) account nearly one-fifth fracture old adult woman sustain rate 5 1 relative male counterpart . The majority DRF occur result low impact injury wrist hand outstretched often manage via closed treatment cast immobilization The aftereffect injury include pain , distal upper limb immobility , distal sensorimotor change , hand weakness , edema , type I complex CRPS development . Women , sustain low-force injury , undergo close treatment cast immobilization DRF , increase risk develop type I CRPS . Given alteration brain 's somatosensory strip likely influence CRPS development , new intervention , grade motor imagery , use restore affected limb cortical representation typical state . Beyond pain reduction , implication type approach also include restore sensorimotor function affect limb . Evidence support intervention impact CRPS symptom well motor function 've develop . To date , literature explore technique , specifically grade motor imagery , apply prevent mitigate aforementioned aftereffect DRF woman . To end investigator propose pilot 6-week randomize comparative effectiveness trial , modify grade motor imagery program + standard care group compare standard care ( SOC ) control group . Immediately follow cast immobilization , intervention group control group participate one 1-hr three 30-minute clinic-based session 15 minute home program three time daily . Blinded assessment occur baseline , 3 week , cast removal , one 3 month cast removal include pain , sensorimotor , edema , CRPS diagnostic outcome . The project 's aim : 1 ) determine feasibility recruiting , enrol , treat , follow participant 2 ) determine participate GMI SOC hand therapy program differing pain , function , count CRPS diagnosis compare receive SOC . The investigator hypothesize 1 ) project feasible carry large scale 2 ) early GMI improve pain , functional upper limb sensorimotor outcomes person close treatment DRF relative standard care intervention . The propose project innovative involves use novel intervention approach design prevent cortical change believe responsible peripheral manifestation sensorimotor dysfunction pain . The occupational therapy 'hand ' literature rich restorative approach little use service prevent condition upper limb , impairment , disability . The investigator 's team , hand therapy scientist , orthopaedic surgeon , clinical expert hand therapy , biostatistician comprehensive , possess collective background enact project . The environment University Minnesota research I university teach hospital ample access patient population . Drs . McGee , Van Heest , O'Brien posse administrative backing protect time . The budget , propose , necessary 1 ) ensure adequate recruitment enrollment , 2 ) prevent attrition , 3 ) support necessary rigorously analyze interpret finding .</detailed_description>
