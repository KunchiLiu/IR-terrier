	<brief_title>Constraint-induced Movement Therapy Self-regulation Children With Cerebral Palsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Children diagnose hemiplegic CP involve . A within-subject design use child act control . The study schedule three-week interval . All child undergo conventional occupational therapy ( OT ) modify constraint-induced movement therapy plus self-regulation ( mCIMT + SR ) program random order . Both program last three week . Each program follow three-week no-treatment period measure carry-over effect . The OT program consist train unimanual bimanual task 1 2 hour week daily home exercise . The mCIMT + SR program involve restraint unaffected upper limb child use cotton sling 6 hour per day 15 day . A one-hour structured task practice use SR provide 6-hour restraint . The Bruininks-Oseretsky Test Motor Proficiency , Jebsen-Taylor Test Hand Function , Caregiver Functional Use Survey , hand dynamometer , pinch gauge , modify Ashworth scale use evaluation . All child assess five time 3-week interval : twice conventional OT ; twice mCIMT + SR 1 week 3 week . Before three-week intervention , child participate event-related potential ( ERP ) session choice reaction task . Event-related potential ( ERP ) technique use capture change neural mechanism intervention .</detailed_description>
