	<detailed_description>The use Beta-adrenergic blockade currently standard care patient traumatic brain injury . Traumatic brain injury common problem society great 1.5 million case occur annually 50,000 death per year civilian population United States . Medical therapy long consist monitor intracranial pressure supportive measure design limit intracranial pressure . Two retrospective observational study complete University Tennessee demonstrate addition beta-adrenergic blockage treatment traumatic brain injury lessen mortality . The basis conducting study establish retrospective data show harm patient receive Inderal potential benefit . Available data , include data University Tennessee , retrospective limited simple exposure drug . The propose study attempt quantify effect dose drug actual beta-blockade instead simple exposure drug . The effect propranolol dosing level use research determine measurement urinary catecholamine study arm comparison actual effect drug catecholamine surge occur follow traumatic brain injury determine . Additionally , effect healthcare disparity outcomes patient traumatic brain injury measure . Outcomes stratify payer status ethnicity determine effect variable outcomes .</detailed_description>
