	<brief_title>A Study Rank Different Dosages Antigen GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) Biologicals ' Investigational Respiratory Syncytial Virus ( RSV ) Vaccine ( GSK3003891A ) , Based Their Immune Response Safety , When Administered Healthy Adult Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose RSV F-021 study conduct observer-blind manner Epoch 1 single blind Epoch 2 , rank 3 different dos non-adjuvanted investigational RSV PreF-vaccine ( 30 , 60 120 μg ) base safety/reactogenicity immunogenicity data 1 month post-vaccination ( Day 30 ) . Non-pregnant woman age 18-45 year randomize 1:1:1:1 ratio receive one three dose level ( 30 , 60 , 120 μg ) RSV PreF vaccine placebo . The dos elicit strong immune response maintain acceptable safety profile consider evaluation , include study vaccinate pregnant woman . This allow evaluation wider antigen dose range determine dose response relationship term antibody response high dose range present low range . Since RSV F-021 120ug dosage PreF-based investigational RSV vaccine test first time human , appropriate safety monitoring plan study , include pause enrolment first 25 % subject study group vaccinate review day 7 post-vaccination safety data unblinded GSK internal Safety Review Committee ( iSRC ) complete . The enrolment/vaccination remain subject start follow favourable outcome iSRC safety review . In addition study visit Day 0 , Day 7 Day 30 evaluate primary objective study , additional study visit plan Day 60 90 investigation immunogenicity safety/reactogenicity profile formulation . A follow-up period set subject contact Day 180 , 270 360 . During contact , investigator ( delegate ) ask subject experience serious adverse event and/or AEs lead study withdrawal since Day 90/last contact ( applicable ) , well become pregnant post-vaccination period . The investigator ( delegate ) also ask subject concomitant vaccinations/products/medications receive since Day 90/last contact ( applicable ) whether respiratory tract infection need medical attention . Contact preferably perform via telephone , alternatively , phone contact possible , email/other mean information fully collect . Healthy , non-pregnant woman age 18 - 45 year enrol study : Women age 18 - 45 year select match vaccine 's target population , i.e . pregnant woman , closely possible ( gender , age ) . Non-pregnant woman select avoid unnecessarily expose vulnerable population ( pregnant woman foetuses/children ) high dose vaccine previously study non-pregnant woman .</detailed_description>
