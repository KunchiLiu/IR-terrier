	<detailed_description>Cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) induce systemic inflammatory response syndrome ( SIRS ) , may contribute postoperative morbidity . Neonates experience exaggerate inflammatory response may high risk deleterious effect CPB . SIRS may disrupt hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA ) axis lead relative adrenal insufficiency ( AI ) neonatal CPB . There emerge evidence support association AI morbidity neonates cardiac surgery . Postoperative steroid may offer hemodynamic benefit neonate suffer low cardiac output syndrome ( LCOS ) follow CPB . Benefit postoperative steroid multifactorial include : suppression inflammatory cytokine , direct action heart vascular smooth muscle , treatment AI subset patient . Little known regard incidence clinical impact AI neonates acute postoperative period follow separation CPB . In randomized control pilot study perform UAB CVICU research team , prophylactic post-CPB hydrocortisone infusion improve postoperative outcome , especially acquire AI . In attempt explore post-CPB AI , retrospective analysis data study perform . Of 40 neonate include study , one-third ( 32.5 % ) develop AI follow CPB ( determine low-dose , 1 µg , cosyntropin stimulation test ) . Almost subject normal response cosyntropin stimulation pre-CPB . Subjects develop AI demonstrate hemodynamic instability , increase serum lactate require colloid resuscitation immediate post-CPB period operating room . In retrospective analysis Crawford et al.8 ACTH level find significantly low post-CPB compare preoperative level . This may secondary blunt HPA axis cause preoperative methylprednisolone ( patient receive ) , could result transient , iatrogenic AI . Serum cytokines significantly different patient exhibit AI compare normal adrenal response indicate increase inflammation primarily responsible development AI . Higher methylprednisolone level result high cortisol level due cross-reactivity assay ; patient high baseline postoperative cortisol level demonstrate blunt response cosyntropin suggest patient may higher blood concentration methylprednisolone metabolite , thereby lead inhibition HPA axis . Taken together , two study demonstrate AI occurs high frequency neonatal CPB AI associate deleterious outcome . While postoperative hydrocortisone improve outcomes neonates AI , investigator exclude preoperative methylprednisolone cause iatrogenic AI . Other investigator show child treat dexamethasone prior surgery , high measure level dexamethasone associate postoperative AI9 . The majority congenital heart surgery center utilize perioperative steroid neonate undergo cardiac surgery rationale modulate post-CPB SIRS treats/prevents AI ; study inconsistently demonstrate benefit approach . Additionally , recent evidence begin highlight potential morbidity associate perioperative steroid administration . Our cardiac surgery program change clinical practice cease give preoperative steroid patient ( previously neonatal CPB patient receive preoperative methylprednisolone ) . With possibility preoperative steroid administration , CPB , primarily cause high incidence AI , prudent investigate benefit and/or harm perioperative steroid administration . With fact mind , investigator design study determine impact preoperative steroid administration development AI outcomes neonatal cardiac surgery . B. Herein investigator propose test follow HYPOTHESES address SPECIFIC AIMS : HYPOTHESES : Preoperative steroid ( methylprednisolone ) administration associate development iatrogenic AI ; AI lead increase postoperative morbidity . Preoperative steroid important impact postoperative clinical outcome . SPECIFIC AIM # 1 : Determine incidence AI ( diagnose 1µg cosyntropin stimulation test ) follow CPB neonate receive preoperative steroid ; compare previous cohort receive preoperative steroid . SPECIFIC AIM # 2 : Compare ACTH cortisol level two cohort neonate ( receive preoperative steroid ) . SPECIFIC AIM # 3 : Compare secondary clinical outcome include volume crystalloid/colloid administer CVOR , hemodynamic parameter , laboratory value , vasoactive-inotrope score ( VIS ) , duration mechanical ventilation , fluid overload mortality two cohort neonate .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>40 consecutive neonate ( ≤30 day age ) complex congenital heart disease undergo cardiac surgery CPB give preoperative steroid . Controls : 40 neonate complex congenital heart disease undergo cardiac surgery CPB receive two dos preoperative methylprednisolone ( 10mg/kg eight hour one hour prior operation ) . Data cohort already prospectively collect original pilot randomize control trial . Based clinical data past 8 year , demographic risk factor two cohort similar . Neonates require CPB cardiac surgery fail separate CPB operating room .</criteria>
