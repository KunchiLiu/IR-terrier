	<brief_summary>The purpose research study test new method could improve diagnosis assessment brain tumor . One methods new MR ( magnetic resonance ) imaging technique call magnetic resonance fingerprinting ( MRF ) , allow rapidly scanning patient provide quantitative information tumor tissue . The investigator compare data gather MR Fingerprinting imaging test , clinical information , treatment detail biopsy result evaluate accuracy new technique .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multi-Parametric Quantitative MR Imaging Evaluation Brain Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective study evaluate utility quantitative MRI image include 3D-MRF differentiating among different untreated brain tumor differentiate recurrent brain tumor ( TR ) treatment effect . GROUP 1 : All patient newly diagnose intra-axial brain neoplasm undergo volumetric MRI study contrast surgical plan clinical diagnosis . Diffusion , diffusion tensor image perfusion image often perform part standard clinical imaging . In addition acquisition , research 3D-MRF acquisition entire tumor acquire . The image parameter correlate individually combination biopsy/ resection outcomes . GROUP 2 : All patient brain tumor present post therapy follow image progression undergo serial image part clinical care . The research 3D-MRF acquisition add clinical scan . All quantitative parameter evaluate individually combination differentiate post treatment change tumor recurrence .</detailed_description>

The presence implant pacemaker implant defibrillator device . Patients contraindication MRI due embed foreign metallic object . Bullets , shrapnel , metalwork fragment , metallic material add unnecessary risk patient . Pregnancy . Regular clinical practice already exclude pregnant patient gadolinium contrast . Implanted medical device describe MRIcompatible . Known history severe claustrophobia . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition MR contrast material . Prisoners member vulnerable population exclude study . The subject selection population regularly include prisoner vulnerable population member population provide additional unique information uniquely benefit study . NonEnglish speak population exclude study due lack sufficient resource pay translator interpreter service . Minors exclude .</criteria>
