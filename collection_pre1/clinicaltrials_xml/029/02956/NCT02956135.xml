	<detailed_description>Handball consider high intensity sport even though 70 % time game stand walk . The large number repetition high intensity activity sprint jumping , associate physical contact oppose player , make sport physically demand activity . Furthermore , overuse injury widely describe poorly quantify . In addition , necessary know influence static lumbar-pelvic position low back pain correlation stability . Not strength important good quality movement , also specific muscle activation order correct motor pattern . This coordinated action must I action muscle agonist , antagonists synergists.The aim study ass relationship presence overuse injuries failure control movement area .
