	<brief_summary>Background/Aims : Large scale adoption integrate care chronic patient constitute key milestone accelerate adaptation current healthcare system evolve need trigger population age high prevalence chronic condition . Lessons learnt deployment experience disseminate `` good practice '' . But , need assessment implementation strategy real world scenario . Moreover , progress achieve disease-oriented integrate care automatically transfer management complex chronic patient ( CCP ) . The protocol address five aim : 1 ) implementation two integrate care intervention use collaborative adaptive case management ( ACM ) approach ( ) Community-based management CCP ; , ii ) Integrated care patient long-term oxygen therapy ( LTOT ) ) ; 2 ) adoption information communication technology ( ICT ) require support collaborative ACM ; 3 ) evaluate impact enhanced clinical health risk assessment stratification ; 5 ) generate roadmap regional adoption CCP program . Methods/Design : CCP program deploy three healthcare sector Barcelona-Esquerra ( AISBE ) ( 520 k citizen ) two area Catalonia : Badalona Serveis Assistencials ( BSA ) ( 420 k citizen ) Lleida ( 366 k citizen ) follow Plan-Do-Study-Act iterative cycle , use Model Assessment Telemedicine evaluation purpose . The study also address step scale-up integrated care entire Catalan region ( 7.5 M citizen ) . Observational study match control plan Community-based management CCP ( n=3.000 ) Integrated care patient LTOT ( n=500 ) . Moreover , cluster randomize control trial ( RCT ) plan top observational study test specific question ( i.e . performance ICT platform provide ACM functionality ) . Main component CCP program : ) patient stratification ; b ) comprehensive assessment strategy ; c ) ICT support adaptive Case management ; ) Roadmap regional adoption . Hypothesis : CCP program generate guideline large scale deployment CCP program , include transferability analysis , facilitate adoption integrate care service management multi-morbidity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Rationale &amp; hypothesis - Both , management multi-morbidity efficient collaboration specialize care community-based service unmet need overcome implementation structure , flexible , service workflow . That , ACM approach , well appropriate patient health risk assessment stratification . The service workflow two sequential phase specific target outcome : ) Short-term ( 30 90 day hospital discharge ) prevention hospital-related event hospital discharge ; ii ) Intervention aim long-term enhanced CCP management . Objectives - To assess impact ICT-supported ACM : ) reduction early hospital-related event include hospital re-admissions , visit emergency department mortality ; , ii ) Health value generation long-term intervention , define target outcome achieve relative costs.Detailed outcome include eleven indicator recommend Spanish Health System cover follow dimension : ) Characteristics study group health status ( i.e , Users attend primary care , Health-related quality life patient caregiver ) ; ii ) Intermediate outcome ( Emergency Department visit ; General Practitioner visit ; Cumulative day per year admit hospital ; Poli-medication ; Potentially avoidable hospitalization ; Hospital readmission ; Needs social support ) ; iii ) Empowerment ( Unhealthy life style ) ; , iv ) Structure ( Access ICT-supported integrate care ) . Moreover , program lifespan progress consolidated International Consortium Health Outcomes Measurement ( ICHOM ) incorporate . Study design - The large-scale deployment evaluate observational study match control group . Assessment do independent team . The number patient include implementation study approximately one-thousand individual per year , include conventional hospitalization home hospitalization recruitment source . Intervention - The general structure service workflow intervention group follow : Case identification . Identification candidate inclusion program follow pre-defined inclusion/exclusion Case evaluation . During hospital admission home hospitalization . A holistic characterization perform cover threefold aim : ) Comprehensive assessment individual 's need health social support ; ii ) Individualized pharmacological non-pharmacological treatment , include adherence self-management intervention need ; iii ) Identification short long-term clinical requirement ; , iv ) Assessment barrier may limit fulfilment program . Personalized work plan definition - Personalized action plan base case evaluation . Work plan execution , follow-up event handle support provide information communication technology ( ICT ) facilitate program follow handle unexpected event : ) foster patient empowerment self-management ; ii ) enhance patient adherence program ; iii ) facilitate remote supervision ; , iv ) allow patient monitoring . Discharge - At end program evaluation.Eventually , move type integrate care service depend upon his/her need . The intervention implement multidisciplinary team hospital Primary Care , advanced-practice nurse , physician , physiotherapist , community nurse , social worker general practitioner reference . The collaboration specialize care primary care guide reform specialize care healthcare sector initiate 2006 . Both team share ICT-supported tool . The intervention hospital admission include four key feature : 1 ) A comprehensive assessment patient entry ; 2 ) A two-hour educational program administer entry nurse follow distribution patient-specific support material . Intervention hospital discharge ) Phone call 24 hour ; b ) Home visit 72 hour discharge . Accessibility point care available 24 hours/day ; PHF , self-management tool appointment 1m discharge . After transitional phase , advanced-practice nurse perform regular training session community-based care team , facilitate high accessibility specialize care need support functionality PHF patient admitted program . The number home care visit , well access specialize care , follow-up 12 month period individually tailor , dynamically adapt , patient need . Moreover , plan visit specialize professional schedule day hospital home visit deem necessary primary care team . ICT- Support - The three main actor , namely : ) healthcare professional access adaptive case management system work plan prescription , follow-up , coaching , care-coordination across healthcare tier ; ii ) adaptive case management system support execution patient work plan provide bridge interoperability collaborative tool among patient ( PHF ) , case manager electronic medical record ; , iii ) patient , access PHF wherein she/he answer questionnaire , perform monitor mHealth apps , access follow-up report tailor educational information . Control group - Patients assign usual care follow conventional treatment , manage physician without support multidisciplinary team , describe intervention group . Clinical assessment - Evaluation do independent team baseline 12-month follow-up . The questionnaire use integrate care team addition design capture patient empowerment characteristic : mental status , activity daily live , anxiety depression , health-related quality life ; acute episode require emergency department consultation and/or hospital admission within healthcare sector assess use share registry public health system . Moreover , core outcome , assess public registry . Data analysis- A sample size 200 patient per group necessary recognize statistically significant effect intervention . The estimated number patient identify screen process ( one-thousand per year ) markedly high minimum require , thus ensure enough statistical power . Results express mean standard deviation ( SD ) , number percentage , correspond category . Comparisons two study group admission 12 month perform use unpaired Student t-test continuous variable , variable compare two category ; , chi-square test non-continuous variable . Changes within group assess pair analysis ( example use paired test ) . The effect intervention mortality time admission analyze respectively use multivariate logistic Cox regression model , adjust baseline difference group . We build saturated model introduce covariates result statistically significant bivariate assessment . After , build parsimonious model exclude , one one , variables significant accord Wald test p-value . Finally , decide final model , compare saturate parsimonious model , accord likelihood ratio test.Statistical significance set p value le 0.05 . Analyses do SPSS release 20 . Additionally , qualitative assessment technology do use standard questionnaire focus group .</detailed_description>
