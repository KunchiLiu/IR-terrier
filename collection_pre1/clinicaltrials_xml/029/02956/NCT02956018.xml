	<brief_summary>Kidney transplant thrombosis ( loss blood flow ) responsible 35 % transplant failures child . Detection kidney transplant thrombosis currently rely recognition deterioration parameter urine output blood creatinine level , change relatively slowly . Confirmation require ultrasound scan . There inherent delay process , time transplant kidney tissue die , result failure transplant . Near infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) non-invasive technique use continuous monitor oxygen level several organ system include brain , muscle , gut , liver native kidney . We hypothesise NIRS apply monitor kidney transplant blood flow real time . We aim test use NIRS detecting blood flow establish kidney transplant child , compare ultrasound , current gold standard measurement . Existing NIRS equipment would use within CE mark purpose measure oxygen level ; mechanistic study would extrapolate measure oxygen level determine blood flow . Participating child attend outpatient clinic routine transplant ultrasound scan NIRs monitor 10 minute period . NIRs data compare validated perfusion score ultrasound image . If study successful , NIRS could provide continuous monitor kidney transplant blood flow postoperative period , thus allow immediate detection blood flow problem . This potential reduce kidney transplant failures thrombosis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose mechanistic pilot study determine whether exist NIRS equipment , use within intend CE mark purpose measure tissue oxygenation , reliably determine blood flow establish kidney transplant . Objectives 1 . To compare NIRS current gold standard measure kidney transplant perfusion , Doppler ultrasound , establish kidney transplant child 2 . To determine practicality use NIRS measure perfusion child establish kidney transplant Outcomes Primary Outcome • Correlation NIRs perfusion data Doppler ultrasound perfusion parameter assess use validate scale . Secondary outcome • Quality NIRS data obtain ( assessed proportion valid reading v lose reading ) Study Design For participate patient undergo routine clinical outpatient renal transplant ultrasound examination , NIRS data record day . Ultrasound examination undertake experienced member radiology team follow standard protocol . NIRS data record member study team . The ultrasound operator perform doppler ultrasound assessment graft parenchymal perfusion , mark skin position transplant upper , inter low pole . The ultrasound assessment include measurement distance skin corticomedullary junction upper , inter low pole kidney transplant . NIRS data record 2 minute two NIRS sensor place transplant mid low pole per marking ultrasound . Data Collection NIRS data store electronically password protect NHS computer identify via individual study number . Oximetry reading export password protect NHS computer analysis . Continuous sample data transform area curve ( AUC ) time period 15 second , 30 second , 1 minute , 5 minute 10 minute . Ultrasound Doppler perfusion data record data collection sheet label participant 's study number . Data record include 1 . Resistive index 2 . Global assessment graft perfusion per validate scale outline 3 . Doppler waveform characteristic 4 . Transplant parenchymal abnormality Renal allograft Doppler perfusion scale : Score Doppler ultrasound assessment 0 Unidentifiable vessel 1 . Few vessel vicinity hilum 2 . Hilar interlobar vessel renal parenchyma 3 . Renal vessel identifiable arcuate artery entire field view Data Protection Data collect retained accordance Data Protection Act 1998 . For identification purpose , patient ' study number , name hospital number store single password protect NHS computer password protect database . Storage record Study document ( paper electronic ) retain secure location trial finish . All source document retain period five year follow end study . Where trial related information document medical record - record identify 'Do destroy dd/mm/yyyy ' label date five year last patient last visit . Statistical analysis NIRS perfusion data time Doppler ultrasound interrogate . Continuous sample data transform area curve ( AUC ) time period 15 second , 30 second , 1 minute , 5 minute 10 minute . NIRS AUC data compare Doppler ultrasound perfusion data use Spearman 's correlation . Accounting repeat measurement within patient , mixed effect logistic regression analysis conduct reciever operate characteristic curve determine NIRS AUC interval ( i.e . 15 sec , 30 sec , 1,5 10 min ) , use dichotomous Doppler ultrasound outcome gold standard . NIRs AUC data perfuse non-perfused allograft pole compare use mixed effect regression analysis . Distributional assumption investigate appropriate suitable transformation use .</detailed_description>
