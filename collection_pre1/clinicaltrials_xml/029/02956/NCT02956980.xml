	<brief_summary>Differences pDCs function relate gender demonstrate adult never address child . Yet , difference immune response relate gender also exist child , response pathogens susceptibility autoimmune disease . The investigator suppose difference partly link difference pDCs function . This study aim compare pDCs function child base gender pubertal status . This study perform healthy child , boy Klinefelter syndrome girl Turner syndrome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There difference immune response accord gender . Women strong response pathogen , especially viruses also susceptible develop autoimmune disease . These point reflect robust innate adaptive response woman . Plasmacytoid dendritic cell ( pDCs ) key actor innate immune response ability produce large amount type 1 Interferons ( IFN1 ) secondary stimulation toll like receptor ( TLR ) 7 9 nucleic acid . Thus , pDCs play major beneficial role antiviral response . In autoimmune disease like Systemic Erythematous Lupus , pDCs also play role , mostly deleterious , inappropriate production IFN1 upon stimulation TLR 's self nucleic acid . In disease , pDCs woman demonstrate produce IFN1 compare men , phenomenon link hormonal genetic factor . Indeed , investigator research team demonstrate IFN1 production human pDCs increase oestradiol specific receptor present pDCs . Regarding genetics , study recently show humanize mouse model , pDCs develop female hematopoietic precursor cell enhance TLR 7 mediate IFN1 response compare male one . These result indicate X chromosome dosage could contribute independently enhance TLR 7 mediate response pDCs woman . Although gene implicate IFN1 production X chromosome , include TLR 7 , mechanism underlie observation presently unknown .</detailed_description>
