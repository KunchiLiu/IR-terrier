	<brief_summary>The propose study phase II randomize trial test innovative concept compare local therapy systemic therapy , e.g . pazopanib , patient newly diagnose limited metastatic RCC . We hypothesize local therapy prolong progression-free survival patient limited metastasis , delay initiation systemic therapy adversely affect survival . Patient stratify Heng 's criterion . Patients curable metastatectomy well patient poor prognosis high chance disease dissemination accord prognostic factor exclude .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Metastatic renal cell carcinoma limit measurable extracranial metastasis Limited metastasis define number lesion reasonably treat local therapy , standard SABR . Radiographic evidence metastatic disease . CT perform 30 day registration . Evaluated deem eligible medical oncologist , radiation oncologist , and/or surgeon ( surgery ) . Prior surgery radiation allow . For previous establish metastatic status , repeat biopsy require . Brain metastasis ( Brain MRI within 6 month registration ) allow intracranial disease must treat . Adequate hematologic , renal , hepatic function define : leukocyte ≥ 3,000/mcL absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcL platelet ≥ 50,000/mcl Creatinine &lt; 2X upper limit normal total bilirubin ≤ 2mg/dL AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SPGT ) ≤ 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal Age ≥ 18 year . Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry , duration study participation , 90 day follow completion therapy . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . A female childbearing potential woman ( regardless sexual orientation , undergone tubal ligation , remain celibate choice ) meet follow criterion : Has undergone hysterectomy bilateral oophorectomy ; Has naturally postmenopausal least 12 consecutive month ( i.e. , menses time precede 12 consecutive month ) . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent agree undergo image study follow Subjects receive prior systemic therapy , except one line immuno cytokine therapy ( e.g . prior IL2 single combination checkpoint inhibitor ) Subjects potentially curable disease surgery alone determine medical oncologist surgeon together Subjects highrisk cardiac/vascular disease unable tolerate pazopanib , e.g . uncontrolled hypertension ( &gt; 160 systolic blood pressure &gt; 100 diastolic blood pressure ) ; Class III/IV congestive heart failure per NYHA classification ; unstable angina stroke . Subjects recent major surgery within 4 week Other contraindication initiate antiangiogenic therapy , include history MI within 8 week . Subjects ≥3 unfavorable prognostic factor define Heng et al. , ( KPS &lt; 80 % , Hgb &lt; LLN , ANC &gt; ULN , platelet count &gt; ULN , correct serum calcium &gt; ULN , time original diagnosis initiate target therapy &lt; 1year ) , median survival 7.8 month 2yr survival 7 % . Subjects life expectancy &lt; 6 month . Subjects may receive investigational agent . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia Subjects psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Subjects must pregnant nursing due potential congenital abnormality potential regimen harm nursing infant .</criteria>
