	<brief_title>Early Laser Treatment Diabetic Eye Disease China : A Pilot Randomized Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>China world 's large number diabetic person . Population study show 10 % Chinese rural-dwellers DR receive therapy . The current standard approach treatment DR often require patient return multiple examination year , reach trial-proven criterion treatment . This long process ill-suited support good compliance care low-resource setting . Our recent publish review suggest early PRP treatment , could reduce burden compliance , may clinically effective cost effective , current evidence base insufficient make firm recommendation .</detailed_description>
