	<brief_summary>Anderson Fabry disease ( AFD ) X-linked lysosomal storage disorder cause deficiency enzyme alpha-galactosidase . AFD involve various organ lead series clinical abnormality . Left ventricular hypertrophy middle-aged men one life threaten complication . It show pending absence myocardial replacement fibrosis , substitution therapy could improve myocardial morphology function well exercise capacity . Today , available marker efficacy treatment heart morphology function . The T1 time ( longitudinal relaxation time ) one major component image formation Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( along T2 time proton density ) . Several technique describe assess myocardial T1-time . One call MOLLI ( Modified Look Locker Inversion Recovery ) , make available research centre Siemens company . In study publish 2013 , Sado et al . show series various condition ( hypertension , AFD , hypertrophic cardiomyopathy , AL amyloidosis , aortic stenosis healthy volunteer ) septal T1 threshold 940ms could discriminate AFD patient . No overlap show condition study . Our experience T1 mapping support finding ( even though threshold could slightly different ) , could recently detect MRI number AFD patient , hypertrophy , others without hypertrophy . The effect Replagal® T1 relaxation time remain unknown . The purpose study follow-up heart morphology , function myocardial T1 relaxation time population treated/untreated patient .</brief_summary>
