	<detailed_description>This Fleming-A ' Hern , single arm , multicenter , no-profit , phase II study radiotherapy Vismodegib adult patient high risk locally advance basal cell carcinoma amenable radical surgery cell carcinoma ( BCC ) ( comparator : applicable ) . The recruitment period expect approximately 24 month . The trial consist Screening/Baseline period ( Day -28 -1 ) , Treatment Period patient treat radiotherapy ( 4 week ) follow Vismodegib 150 mg/die continuously six cycle ( 24 week ) . The study end 14 month start treatment last patient enrol evaluable accord primary end point . The primary objective evaluate activity study therapy ( radiotherapy follow six cycle Vismodegib 150 mg/d continuously ) term proportion patient progression free 12 month . The secondary objective : evaluate efficacy study therapy term progression free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) ; assess response term overall response rate ( ORR ) ( complete response ( CR ) , partial response ( PR ) , stable disease ( SD ) , progressive disease ( PD ) ) ; assess duration response ( DoR ) ; assess safety term incidence , type , severity adverse event ( AEs ) serious adverse event ( SAEs ) ; measure effect skin disease quality life ( QoL ) patient therapy ( Skindex-16 )</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Written , sign inform consent 2 . Age ≥ 18 year 3 . Histopathologic confirmation lesion BCC enrollment 4 . Patients high risk relapse BCC undergone radical surgery , treat physician must consider disease operable . 5 . Clinical feature define high risk relapse include infiltrative growth margin , size , tumor location , histological subtype ( morpheaform , sclerosing , infiltrate , micronodular metatypical subtypes associate high risk relapse compare risk associate superficial nodular type ) , recurrentrefractory tumor ( see Table 1 ) , basal cell carcinoma size ( large tumor diameter ) ≤ 5 cm head neck tumor 6 . Clinical feature definition `` BCC amenable radical surgery '' include : BCC recur location minimum 2 surgical procedure ( exclude biopsy ) and/or curative resection deem unlikely multifocal BCC extensive tumor ( see table 1 ) bleeding infected area anticipate substantial morbidity and/or deformity surgery ( e.g. , removal part facial structure , nose , ear , eyelid , eye ; requirement limb amputation ) 7 . Patients BCCs localize surgery technically difficult , would result unacceptable tissue destruction 8 . Patients clinical contraindication surgery 9 . Previous radiotherapy BCC 10 . Patients measurable and/or nonmeasurable disease ( defined RECIST , v1.1 ) allow 11 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 01 12 . Adequate hematopoietic capacity , define follow : Hemoglobin : 8.5 g/dl Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1500/mL Platelet count ≥ 75,000/mL 13 . Adequate hepatic function , define follow : Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) ≤ 3 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × ULN within 3 × ULN patient document Gilbert syndrome . Adequate renal function , define calculate serum creatinine clearance ( CrCl ) ≥ 30 mL/min 14 . For woman childbearing potential , negative serum pregnancy test within 7days prior commencement dosing require . 15 . Women childbearing potential must use two method acceptable contraception include one highly effective method barrier method , direct physician , treatment least 24 month completion study treatment . Highly effective method contraception define result low failure rate ( i.e. , less 1 % per year ) use consistently correctly ( e.g. , implant , injectables , combine oral contraception , intrauterine device ) . At discretion Investigator , acceptable method contraception may include total abstinence . Periodic abstinence ( e.g. , calendar , ovulation , symptothermal , post ovulation method ) withdrawal acceptable method contraception ( See Appendix B ) . 16 . For male patient female partner childbearing potential , agreement use condom , even vasectomy , sexual intercourse female partner treat Vismodegib , 2 month completion study treatment 17 . Agreement donate blood blood product study least 24 month completion study treatment ( Vismodegib ) . 1 . Inability unwillingness swallow capsule 2 . Inability unwillingness comply study procedures 3 . Pregnancy lactation ( lactation allow least 24 month completion study treatment ) 4 . Concurrent nonprotocolspecified antitumor therapy ( e.g. , chemotherapy , target therapy , photodynamic therapy , include participation experimental drug study ) 5 . Metastatic BCC 6 . Gorlin Syndrome contraindication radiotherapy 7 . Recent ( i.e. , within past 28 day prior enrollment study ) current participation another experimental drug study 8 . Uncontrolled medical illness , include advanced malignancy , discretion Investigator 9 . History disease , metabolic dysfunction , physical examination finding , clinical laboratory find give reasonable suspicion disease condition contraindicate use investigational drug might affect interpretation result study render patient high risk treatment complication</criteria>
