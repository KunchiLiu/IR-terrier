	<detailed_description>In vitro study ibrutinib venetoclax note significant cytotoxicity synergy mantle cell lymphoma chronic lymphocytic leukemia cell lines.Data demonstrate synergy two agent various B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma ( NHL ) cell line . The investigator theorize combination ibrutinib venetoclax provide dual , yet unique , targeted inhibition patient follicular lymphoma , result significant efficacy less nonspecific toxicity .</detailed_description>
