	<brief_summary>Transcatheter aortic valve implantation ( TAVI ) rapidly adopt worldwide since first-in-man TAVI perform 2002 . With increase experience improvement valve design , `` minimalist '' approach transfemoral TAVI ( use local anesthesia fluoroscopic guidance ) become attractive concept , technical feasibility approach well document . While early data show prolonged length stay TF-TAVI [ 10.5 ± 8.1 day FRANCE 2 registry 10.2 ± 11.1 day PARTNER Cohort A data , UK TAVI registry ( reference ) show decline post-TAVI length stay 10 day 8 day time period 2007 2012 . More contemporary data center publish show 23 % TF-TAVI patient discharge within 3 day TAVI . With increasingly minimalist approach TF-TAVI , duration monitoring require post-procedure remain indeterminate lack formal consensus . Early discharge ( within 3 day TAVI ) hypothesize multiple potential advantage , include reduction unnecessarily lengthy hospitalization frail elderly patient addition cost-saving benefit . Rouen University Hospital previously publish retrospective study feasibility safety early discharge , discharge within 72 hour uncomplicated TF-TAVI safe attain 36 % patient . Pre-existing pacemaker absence acute kidney injury independent predictor successful early discharge .</brief_summary>
