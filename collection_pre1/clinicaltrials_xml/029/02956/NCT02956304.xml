	<detailed_description>Embodied cognition claim representation share process resource sensorimotor system . More specifically , propose language comprehension rely internal simulation meaning . For instance , numerous study show process action-related concept involve motor activation similar action actually perform . However , even study show clearly action-related concept involve motor activation , activation may incidental activation representation , rather part . Another way show motor component take part representation manipulable objetcs investigate whether impairment motor system would impair memory manipulable object . In study , investigator use Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( TMS ) stimulate ventral premotor cortex ( PMv ) see whether stimulation affect memory manipulable object , memory nonmanipulable object . For purpose , three TMS condition assess : cTBS inhibit motor cortex , iTBS excite motor cortex , SHAM condition control .</detailed_description>
