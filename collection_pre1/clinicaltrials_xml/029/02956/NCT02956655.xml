	<brief_title>Effect Fasting Therapy Blood Glucose Control Islet Function Newly Diagnosed Type 2 Diabetic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study investigate effect fast therapy blood glucose control islet function newly diagnose type 2 diabetic patient . 60 participant recruit outpatient inpatient First Affiliated Hospital Sun Yat-sen University accord eligibility criterion . All eligible subject randomly allocate 2 group , fast group intense insulin therapy group . The former one receive fasting therapy 14 day latter treat intense insulin therapy include short-term continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion treatment four stage intensive insulin treatment 2 week . First , determine whether fast therapy effective glucose control , investigator observe required time control rate target glucose level , average fast blood glucose postprandial blood glucose well glucose amelioration degree patient . Then , patient undergo follow-up period 1 year , fast postprandial blood glucose glycosylated hemoglobin participant monitor assess long-term remission rate diabetes . Patients invited review glucose lipid metabolic index 3 month , 6 month 12 month follow-up . Lifestyle guidance offer specialist physician throughout follow-up period . Secondly , patient require take insulin C-peptide releasing test fast well follow-up investigate short-term long-term treatment effect islet function access first secretion function pancreatic island calculate insulin resistance ( HOMA-IR ) HOMA-B homeostasis model assessment . In summary , study aim explore short-term long-term therapeutic effect new onset type 2 diabetes , hop provide novel , effective convenient treatment method .</detailed_description>
