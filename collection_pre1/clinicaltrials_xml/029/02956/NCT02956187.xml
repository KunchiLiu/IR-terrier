	<brief_summary>Background . Functional dyspepsia characterize symptom apparently originate stomach without detectable cause conventional diagnosis test . The pathophysiology functional dyspepsia know , number data indicate dyspeptic patient increase sensitivity digestive system , physiological stimulus may induce symptom . Some patient functional dyspepsia also functional constipation investigator hypothesize constipation trigger facilitate dyspeptic symptom , consequently , correction constipation relieve dyspeptic symptom . Objective . To demonstrate superiority biofeedback versus fiber supplement treatment dyspeptic symptom patient constipation due functional outlet obstruction . Design . Randomized , control parallel trial perform referral center . Participants . Consecutive patient complain symptom functional dyspepsia functional outlet obstruction . Interventions : Patients assign experimental ( biofeedback functional outlet obstruction ) active comparator ( fiber supplementation ) arm . Biofeedback functional outlet obstruction : session biofeedback guided anorectal manometry ( perform first 3 week intervention period ) combine instruction daily exercise 4 week . Fiber supplementation : 2.5 g plantago ovata per day 4 week . Main outcome measure . Clinical symptoms functional dyspepsia measure daily questionnaire 7 consecutive day last week intervention . Relevance . Functional Dyspepsia , define purely clinical criterion , bring together diverse group condition different pathophysiology . As result , treatment empirical globally inefficient . This study identify subset patient common pathophysiological mechanism dyspeptic symptom ( functional outlet obstruction ) respond specific treatment ( biofeedback ) .</brief_summary>
