	<brief_title>A Randomized Study Evaluate Safety Efficacy Various Doses STP705 Subjects With Hypertrophic Scar</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-center , randomize , double-blind , within-subject placebo control study design evaluate safety efficacy various dos STP705 administer intradermal injection subject linear hypertrophic scar . Twenty four subject divide equally among 3 cohort ( 20 , 30 40 μg/cm2/day dose level ) 8 subject . Each subject receive active ( STP705 ) control ( Placebo ) treatment twice week total 4 week . The total length linear hypertrophic scar divide equally treatment STP705 placebo . STP705 Placebo inject intradermal every 1 cm length hypertrophic scar . Subjects confine clinic research unit 24 hour post-dosing first treatment administration serial PK assay blood sample collect follow post-dosing time : 30 min , 1 hr , 2 hr , 3 hr , 4 hr , 5hrs , 6 hr , 8 hr , 12 hr , 16 hr , 24 hr , 32 hr 36 hr . Post-dosing ECG perform 6 hour ( ±1 hr ) first study drug administration vital sign monitor every 2h till 12h post-administration . Adverse event medication monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>
