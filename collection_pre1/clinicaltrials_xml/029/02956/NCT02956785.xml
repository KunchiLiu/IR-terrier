	<detailed_description>This randomize study carry delivery suite Warwick Hospital eligible woman inform study book induction labor provide study information leaflet When attend induction labor delivery suite , informed consent obtain woman cardiotocogram ( CTG ) perform initially assessed vaginal examination Bishop score record insertion first slow-release pessary ( Propess速10 mg Dinoprostone ; CTS , UK ) , insert high posterior vaginal fornix . Assessment insertion pessary do experienced obstetrician senior midwife All woman give require care support per local protocol guideline Women exclude study within first 24 hour induction labor follow condition : - Women abnormal non-reassuring CTG need intervention . - Women need tocolytic use . - Women need removal Dinoprostone pessary . - Women need emergency Caesarean section . - If spontaneous rupture membrane occurs . - If artificial rupture membrane achievable first 24 hour induction labor ( Bishop score 5 ) - If woman withdraw consent continue part study . After 24 hour insertion first Dinoprostone pessary , woman reassess total 330 woman Bishop score less 7 , randomly assign one three intervention group pre-formed computer-generated random list randomization put seal opaque envelope keep locked secure area delivery suite . Intervention group follow : Group 1 ( 110 woman ) : Women initial slow-release Dinoprostone pessary leave place six hour ( total 30 hour place ) remove followed vaginal assessment 48 hour start labour induction insertion second slow-release pessary require ( Currently Propess速 license repeat second dose .
