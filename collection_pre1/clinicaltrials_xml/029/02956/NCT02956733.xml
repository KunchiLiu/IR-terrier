	<brief_summary>The fasciotomy incision lead large , unsightly , chronic wound surgical intervention . The classic management split thickness skin graft lead insensate skin 23 % people upset appearance wind 12 % force change occupation . Since skin loss occur fasciotomy utilizing dermal property creep , stress relaxation load cycling closure achieve well way . Our hypothesis use dermatotraction approximation could do use inexpensive equipment readily available standard operating room .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dermotaxis v/s Loop Suture Technique Closure Fasciotomy Wounds : Study 50 Cases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>25 case fasciotomy close either dermotaxis loop suture technique inclusion criterion close fracture , concomitant skin loss , fracture relate compartment syndrome fasciotomy within 36 hr . The fasciotomy incision either close single stage loop suture technique gradually dermotaxis edema settle 3-5 day . The result grade excellent approximation could achieve , good suture apply protective care poor graft . In dermotaxis ( Singhs skin traction ) method two parallel kirschner wire ( 1.5mm ) pass dermis either side wound margin interconnect compression device consist thread rod two block compression knob . Gradual compression apply daily rate 1 turn/12hours side wind . The loop suture technique involve use corrugate drain Ethilon no.1 . It extension purse string suture technique surgical suture pass run stitch along edge wound way end suture drawn tight wound close . Two corrugated drain ( 1 &amp; 2 ) anchor skin adjacent fasciotomy incision use Ethilon no.1 . Then suture pass one edge wound skin corrugate drain alternate fashion .</detailed_description>
