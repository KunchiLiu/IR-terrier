	<detailed_description>Left ventricular hypertrophy ( LVH ) present majority patient type 2 diabetes , since affect 70 % . It strong independent predictor cardiovascular death event even bad triple vessel coronary disease . The reason LVH adverse predate many different cardiovascular event i.e . LVH intrinsically arrhythmogenic cause sudden death , impede leave ventricular ( LV ) fill lead diastolic heart failure , reduces coronary perfusion reserve cause ischaemia cause leave atrial enlargement , atrial fibrillation ( AF ) , cardio-embolic stroke . Controlling blood pressure ( BP ) use drug block renin-angiotensin system ( RAS ) standard approach management LVH approach partially effective since 44 % patient type 2 diabetes normotensive patient LVH . Thus `` normotensive LVH '' common . Indeed , BP contribute 25 % variability LV mass see population . ( This important since LVH thing high level LV mass ) . Despite `` normal '' BP , normotensive LVH risky hypertensive LVH . Nevertheless , know regress LVH irrespective BP change effective way reduce incidence major cardiovascular ( CV ) event include specifically sudden death , heart failure hospitalisation , new onset AF stroke . The Losartan Intervention For Endpoint reduction hypertension study ( LIFE ) provide conclusive proof diabetes , LVH regression per se reduces future cardiovascular event ( 24 % ) , reduce CV death ( 37 % ) reduce total death ( 41 % ) irrespective BP . Since control BP use angiotensin enzyme inhibitor angiotensin receptor blocker partially effective regress LVH , additional way regress LVH require . Insulin resistance another mediator LVH . The literature awash observational study link insulin resistance LVH . Pub Med identify 67 paper , 5 inconclusive . In remain 62 paper , 46 identify significant relationship LVH measure insulin resistance 16 find relationship . The large study mostly positive include Framingham , Whitehall trial , Strong Heart trial Women 's Health Initiative trial Hypertension Genetic Epidemiology Network ( HyperGEN ) trial one large negative trial . There multitude mechanism whereby hyperinsulinaemia produce LVH e.g . signal pathway Akt , transform growth factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor , increase myocardial free fatty acid oxidation RAS activation cause sodium retention thus increase cardiac preload . Therefore , likely glycaemia contributes LVH . However , reduce glycaemia per se appear insufficient reduce CV event key ancillary property anti-glycaemic drug necessary deliver CV benefit badly need diabetes . A separate albeit relate factor mediate LVH obesity . Importantly , dapagliflozin show reduce weight . Thus ideal treatment regress LVH might one improve glycaemia one also aids weight loss . Dapagliflozin obvious option since show reduce glycaemia weight . Metformin anti-glycaemic reduces glycaemia weight . Indeed reason metformin reduces CV event diabetes anti-glycaemic agent could well part metformin reduce glycaemia weight reduce LVH ( fact already separate British Heart Foundation grant see metformin really reduce LV mass ) . However dapagliflozin unique effect CV system impact LVH . Dapagliflozin reduce blood pressure ( LV afterload ) also reduce LVH . Further reduce BP even normotensive patient show definitely regress LVH . Dapagliflozin also diuretic effect reduce preload heart ( measure preload trial MRI assess end diastolic volume ) . The fact dapagliflozin reduces preload afterload heart make uniquely promising way reduce future CV event patient diabetes , , reduce LV hypertrophy . Thus , dapagliflozin regress LVH patient diabetes unique reduce four main cause LVH : glycaemia/insulin resistance , weight , preload blood pressure . No anti-diabetic medication alters even three . Even metformin alters two since change blood pressure . All diabetic medication reduce one ( glycaemia ) mediator LVH . This may new anti-glycaemic agent fail reduce CV event . In trial , propose trial whether dapagliflozin cause regression independent cardiac risk factor LVH diabetic participant optimal current evidence base therapy . Original Hypothesis Dapagliflozin regress LVH normotensive participant type 2 diabetes . RATIONALE FOR TRIAL Cardiac MRI use assess whether Dapagliflozin regress LV mass placebo one year treatment period . If , would strongly suggest Dapagliflozin reduce CV event especially 44 % patient type 2 diabetes LVH despite control blood pressure . All study examine LVH regression require parallel group study effect LV mass take 6-12 month occur . Hence parallel group , one year trial active drug vs. placebo . The issue dapagliflozin CV event diabetes hot topic . Most new antidiabetic drug neutral harmful , judge pharmacological effect , quite possible dapagliflozin might reduce CV event . A large ongoing trial ( Dapagliflozin Effect CardiovascuLAR Events - Thrombolysis Myocardial Infarction ( DECLARE - TIMI ) ) begin look . Why therefore also need trial effect dapagliflozin LV mass LVH ? If DECLARE-TIMI show clearly dapagliflozin reduces CV event , trial reveal possible contributing mechanism reduce CV event i.e . LVH regression ( patient DECLARE-TIMI receive echocardiography subgroup analysis able answer question electrocardiogram useless identify LVH . Furthermore , accuracy MRI echo great echo study LVH regression longer consider reliable ) . In word , large mega-trials like DECLARE-TIMI valuable , parallel small mechanistic study like enhance value help explain mechanisms produce mega-trial result and/or help identify subgroup get particular benefit mean drug become cost effective subgroup . Overall , trial might , conjunction mega-trial , help decide course future research ( LVH favour target ? ) help decide apply result mega-trial clinical practice .</detailed_description>
