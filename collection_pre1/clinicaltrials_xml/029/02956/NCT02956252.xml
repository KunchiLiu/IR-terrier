	<brief_title>Spinal Versus General Anesthesia Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Laparoscopic cholecystectomy ( LC ) gold standard surgical treatment symptomatic cholecystectomy traditionally perform general anesthesia . Laparoscopy provide many advantage open surgery patient ; however , general anesthesia adversely affect patient ' early postoperative quality life ( POQoL ) . Spinal anesthesia less invasive technique compare general anesthesia many advantage regard POQoL need wait recovery anesthesia , less nausea vomiting , less pain end surgery , discomfort associate intubation , early ambulation , fully awaken orient patient bed , less anxious relative . LC show feasible spinal anesthesia perform proper technique . There many report demonstrate effectiveness safety LC spinal anesthesia select patient . However , patient complicate gallstone disease acute , gangrenous subacute cholecystitis consider unfit case LC spinal anesthesia technical difficulty . On hand , spinal anesthesia also regard inappropriate patient comply American society anesthesiology ( ASA ) III IV due uncontrolled anesthesia risk . The aim study compare early postoperative outcome unselected consecutive patient underwent LC spinal versus general anesthesia . If proportion general anesthesia ( PGA ) / proportion spinal anesthesia ( PSA ) denote proportion rate outcomes general anesthesia group ( GaG ) / spinal anesthesia group ( SaG ) , two-sided test problem assess follow : 1 . Null hypothesis : H0 : PGA = PSA . There difference two anesthesia technique term primary outcome . 2 . Null hypothesis : H1 : PGA â‰  PSA There difference two anesthesia technique term primary outcome .</detailed_description>
