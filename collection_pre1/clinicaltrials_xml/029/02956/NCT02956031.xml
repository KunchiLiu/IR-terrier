	<brief_summary>Nearly 8 000 new cervical cancer case diagnose South Africa per year ; many still undiagnosed 50 % diagnosed case succumb per year . Although current prevalence pre-cancer cervical disease largely unknown , data local study suggest regional difference increase prevalence cytological abnormality compare historical data . Low frequency cytology screen primary factor attributable development invasive cervical cancer almost one-third cervical cancer patient previous negative cytology . Due low sensitivity cytology assume true prevalence pre-cancer disease underestimate available data . One round optimal cervical cytology detect around 50 % exist pre-cancer cervical disease identify proven use colposcopy direct biopsy . It widely accept primary screen human papilloma virus ( HPV ) test improve sensitivity screen even single round HPV screen rapidly reduce incidence invasive cervical cancer relate mortality within year . South Africa high prevalence HIV infection delay failure initiate antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) . These fact , together largely unscreened status female population high incidence cervical cancer suggest HPV infection precursor cervical cancer unusually common among South African woman . Accurate current knowledge performance new generation HPV base screening test HIV-infected general female population essential cost-analysis planning national prevention screen program . This study aim demonstrate feasibility efficacy new generation HPV deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) base screening assay South African setting . The investigator hypothesize HPV test follow normal special cytology test successful screen model South African population .</brief_summary>
