	<brief_summary>A cluster randomize controlled trial chosen exploit robustness design help ascertain efficacy BCC intervention compare routine dietary practice . This protocol develop accord guideline Consolidated Standards Reporting Trials ( CONSORT ) statement extension cluster randomize trial . The present study aim evaluate effect improve micronutrient intake behavior change communication intervention nutritional status academic performance school age child . Moreover , may help prevent mitigate malnutrition . However best knowledge author , BCC intervention use poster , lecture school teacher student yet empirically test generally Ethiopia , specifically study area context . The present intervention unique combine use conventional BCC intervention tool , , lecture poster reminder intervention reinforcement .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Behavior Change Communication About Improved Micronutrient Intake Nutritional Status Academic Performance School Age Children Meskan District , Gurage Zone , South Ethiopia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : School age child ( SAC ) vulnerable malnutrition adverse effect academic performance school . Micronutrient deficiency affect many two billion people world . About 250 million people suffer deficiency iron , vitamin A , zinc iodine child . Malnutrition micronutrient deficiency lead low enrolment completion rate . A nutrition behavior change strategy provide individual necessary resource , knowledge , skill , motivation reinforcement need encourage positive change health behavior . So far , study context study area particular country general effect behavior change communication ( BCC ) improve nutritional status , micronutrient intake academic performance school age child . Objective : The aim study protocol evaluate effect behavior change communication ( BCC ) nutritional status academic performance school age child South Ethiopia . The hypothesis child intervention arm increase academic performance improve nutritional status micronutrient intake child control arm . Methods : A cluster randomize control trial carry achieve mention objective , finding use input policy strategy design mitigate problem . A twelve-month cluster randomize control trial conduct 8 school 370 student ten fifteen year old . The school intervention include BCC student science teacher essential nutrition hygiene action ( ENHAs ) provide background Health education Nutritionist . Demographic characteristic , knowledge , attitude &amp; practice ( KAP ) micronutrient deficiency prevention , micronutrient intake , anthropometric measurement ( height &amp; weight ) , academic performance assessment baseline , mid line end line assessment . The academic performance child assess use end term semester result obtain English Mathematics subject overall subject average . The trial ( n= 376 ) two randomly assign arm : control cluster school ( CC ) intervention cluster school ( IC ) accord cluster . The IC receive 12 month nutrition behavior change communication intervention use two mode ( lecture , poster ) CC receive routine dietary practice . The primary outcome study stunt , micronutrient intake , dietary diversity score , academic performance child ; ass use questionnaire , KAP micronutrient deficiency prevention , anthropometry measurement . Secondary outcome include thinness , underweight , overweight obesity . A multivariate logistic regression analysis use identify independent predictor nutritional status academic performance school age child control confounding variable . The effect BCC nutritional status academic performance determine use generalize estimate equation ( GEE ) linear mixed effect model . For primary outcome , stunt , micronutrient intake , dietary diversity score , academic performance child , difference mean change follow-up intervention control arm compare . The hypothesis test intent-to-treat principle use Generalized Linear Mixed Models ( GLMMs ) account correlation induce cluster child within school . To explore effect intervention , GLMMs fit ( 1 ) adjust baseline covariates interest , consider priori , relevant change nutritional status , KAP micronutrient deficiency prevention , micronutrient intake dietary diversity score ; ( 2 ) adjust baseline variable distribute differently intervention group ; ( 3 ) test interaction term treatment group covariates ; ( 4 ) examine completers . Differences secondary outcome , underweight obesity analyze parallel fashion . Mediating moderating effect factor mention also explore . Discussion : Results trial provide evidence effectiveness nutrition BCC innovation school setting Meskan district . They provide recommendation strengthen nutrition component behavior change communication child health service .</detailed_description>
