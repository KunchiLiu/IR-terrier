	<brief_title>Enhanced Recovery Cesarean Birth Improve Postoperative Outcomes Reduce Postoperative Length Stay</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator hypothesize enhanced recovery program include several evidence base intervention time cesarean birth obstetrics promote early ambulation , resumption diet initiation breastfeeding , reduce postoperative hospital length stay . Enhanced Recovery Protocol Components : 1 . Provide preoperative education perioperative recovery experience include postoperative analgesia , thromboprophylaxis breastfeed education 2 . Minimize preoperative starvation time 1 . Moderate amount clear 2 hour prior anesthesia 2 . Solid food 6-8 hour prior anesthesia 3 . Prophylactic antibiotic 4 . Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis ( mechanical ) initiate time cesarean birth continue postoperatively 5 . Providing Duramorph time regional anesthesia reduce postoperative narcotic requirement 6 . Chewing gum ( Xylitol ) reduce postoperative ileus 7 . Routine administration Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug , Ketorolac , 15mg every 6 hour 24 hour postoperatively minimize postoperative narcotic use 8 . Early initiation feed cesarean , immediately clear , 30 minute regular diet tolerate 9 . Early removal urinary catheter ( 12 hour postoperatively ) 10 . Early removal dressing ( 6 hour postoperatively ) 11 . Early mobilization 12 hour delivery 12 . Early skin-to- skin/breastfeeding initiation 13 . Early incentive spirometry Currently , patient encourage ambulate first post-operative day , largely left patient actually begin ambulate . They similarly offer diet first postoperative day encourage eat . Breastfeeding systematically encourage early part Montefiore 's effort get baby friendly designation . And finally , patient typically discharge postoperative day number three unless complication arise newborn mother . As part study , patient enhance recovery usual care group offer opportunity discharge hospital postoperative day number 2 recovery progress well choose leave encourage return home postoperative day number 3 accord current standard care .</detailed_description>
