Have document asymptomatic CMV infection , screen value CMV DNA ≥910 IU/mL ≤ 91000 IU/mL plasma ≥2730 IU/mL ≤273000 IU/mL whole blood 2 consecutive assessment , separate least 1 day , determine local central specialty laboratory quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( qPCR ) comparable quantitative CMV DNA result . Both sample take within 14 day prior randomization second sample obtain within 5 day prior randomization . Same laboratory sample type ( plasma whole blood ) use assessment . Asymptomatic CMV infection define infection present tissue invasive CMV disease , assess investigator . 5 . If presenting recurrent CMV infection , least 2 week undetectable CMV DNA ( base local laboratory result , use laboratory sample type ) antiviral treatment current prior infection ( least two week ) . Otherwise , current infection consider continuation prior infection . 6 . Per investigator 's judgment , eligible treatment valganciclovir . 7 . Have follow result part screen laboratory assessment ( result either central laboratory local laboratory use qualification ) : 1 . Absolute neutrophil count ≥1000/mm3 [ 1.0 x 109/L ] 2 .

Have CMV tissue invasive disease assess investigator time screen randomization Visit 2/Day 0 . 2 . Have CMV infection know genotypically resistant ganciclovir , valganciclovir , foscarnet , cidofovir base documented evidence . 3 . Require ganciclovir , valganciclovir , foscarnet , cidofovir administration condition CMV study treatment initiate ( example : herpes simplex virus [ HSV ] coinfection require use agent randomization ) would need coadministration maribavir CMV infection . 4 . Be receive leflunomide , artesunate study treatment initiate . NOTE : Subjects may receive leflunomide must discontinue use least 14 day prior randomization Visit 2/Day 0 first dose study treatment . Subjects receive artesunate must discontinue use prior first dose study treatment . 5 . Be treatment antiCMV agent ( ganciclovir , valganciclovir , foscarnet cidofovir ) current CMV infection longer 72 hour . Note : Subjects administer anti CMV agent prophylaxis , secondary prophylaxis , treatment prior infection , treatment complete least 2 week prior study entry start treatment current infection , whichever come first undetectable CMV DNA ( base local laboratory ) least two week completion treatment onset current infection . Note : A subject receive ganciclovir , valganciclovir , foscarnet must discontinue use first dose study treatment . A subject may receive cidofovir must discontinue antiviral least 14 day prior randomization Visit 2/Day 0 first dose study treatment . 6 .
