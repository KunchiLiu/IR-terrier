	<brief_summary>This research seek evaluate expressive writing novel intervention problem drinking among college student . The vast majority individually focus brief intervention target college drinking focus personalized feedback approach recent innovation largely limited finer distinction , require assessment programming implementation . The present research propose expressive write novel alternative , use extensively domains alcohol intervention strategy . H1a : Participants write negative drinking event show reduced drinking drinking-related negative consequence relative student neutral control group . H1b : Participants write distress non-alcohol event show increased psychological wellbeing relative student neutral control group . H1c : Participants write negative drinking event show reduce drinking consequence compare empirically-supported brief intervention ( i.e. , PNF ) . This exploratory hypothesis . H2a : Alcohol narratives strong effect alcohol outcomes relative distress narrative . H2b : Alcohol guilt narrative strongest effect alcohol outcome relative condition . H3a : Expression guilt , assess self-report content cod LIWC , mediate intervention effect drink outcome . H3b : Change think , assess LIWC coding , mediate intervention effect drinking .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The current research build previous research target heavy drinking among college student . A large volume research provide impressive data base support one type individually-focused alcohol intervention population ( i.e. , personalize feedback ) . The success paradigm probably contribute dearth consideration alternative paradigm . Expressive write one alternative , receive extensive support domain recently consider potential intervention heavy drinking . The preliminary data examine approach promise provide firm foundation efficacy trial . Further , research incorporates novel theoretical construct include specific focus guilt expressive writing content well `` change thought , '' analogue mechanism presume underlie motivational treatment alcohol substance use disorder . The investigator plan employ similar method use successfully large NIAAA fund trial evaluate brief intervention heavy drinking college student . This research consist intervention study evaluate expressive writing brief intervention reduce drink improve psychological well-being among college student . Participation study involve completion screen assessment , baseline assessment , intervention procedure , post-intervention assessment , follow-up assessment 1- , 3- , 6- , 12-months . Heavy drink college student ( N = 600 ) randomly assign one six condition base 2 ( alcohol vs. distress topic ) × 2 ( guilt vs. guilt focus ) + 1 ( neutral control ) + 1 ( personalize normative feedback ) design . Before complete baseline survey , student randomly assign one six study condition , five involve write three session course one month . Specifically , participant assign write heavy drinking event , heavy drinking event elicit guilt , distress event , distress event elicit guilt , first day college ( neutral control condition ) . Participants randomly assign PNF condition receive traditional personalized normative feedback regard drinking compare student gender university . The norm come large recently complete alcohol survey conduct University Houston examine social norm alcohol prevention ( R01AA014576 ) . To maintain consistency across condition , participant PNF condition still come lab three time . They receive feedback first intervention session ask complete narrative prompt neutral control condition second third session . For individual expressive writing condition , three narrative prompt complete every week three week , first occur follow baseline assessment . All baseline assessment , narrative intervention assignment , immediate post-tests condition conduct in-lab . All assessment include screen follow-up assessment complete remotely web . The rationale include personalized normative feedback condition able compare efficacy expressive writing intervention exist brief alcohol intervention . Thus , present design allow evaluation efficacy relative control condition also evaluate comparative efficacy relative exist empirically-supported brief alcohol intervention . Aims evaluate use multi-level regression analysis , often refer Hierarchical Linear Modeling ( HLM ) mixed-effects model . With respect evaluate main effect experimental condition drinking , participant provide baseline , post-intervention , 1-month , 3-month , 6-month , 12-month follow-up data . Hypotheses test use specific contrast vector , use general linear hypothesis framework . The study consist ( 2×2+1+1 ) design , represent factorial design addition control group write first day school computer-based PNF comparison group . Hypotheses tested contrast correspond question interest . The first two hypothesis represent contrast alcohol narrative condition neutral control condition ( H1a ) guilt narrative condition neutral control condition ( H1b ) . In examine hypothesis , investigator construct two dummy cod variable reflect alcohol versus non-alcohol narrative condition guilt non-guilt narrative condition reference group neutral control condition . Thus , PNF group include test two hypothesis . Dependent variable include alcohol outcome H1a psychological well-being H1b . For analysis participant provide 5 repeated measure ( i.e. , baseline , 1-month , 3-months , 6-months , 12-months ) , yield 3000 Level 1 case ( repeated-measures ) across 600 Level 2 case . The investigator also evaluate mediator intervention effect . Additionally , investigator follow procedure assess mediation . Mediation test indirect effect use AB product method A represent effect intervention contrast time interaction mediator ( expression guilt change think ) . B represent association mediator subsequent drinking outcome . Both A B path control baseline outcome . Evaluation hypotheses regard moderation effect test whether individual difference guilt-proneness interact intervention contrast . These test expand model add main effect product term propose moderator intervention contrast . Power analyse focus estimate sample size large enough detect `` true '' effect , thereby avoid Type II error . Sample size estimate obtain intervention contrast . Necessary sample size assess via sample size power equation normally distribute outcome . Effect-sizes variance component base preliminary study , power set 0.80 estimate . Power estimate use Optimal Design software program . The investigator anticipate intervention effect relative neutral control condition drink range delta =.30-.40 ) . Based proposed sample size 500 ( ~PNF include H1a H1b ) , give five assessment point , investigator anticipate ability detect main effect intervention contrast power=.80 . Considering maximum anticipated attrition rate 20 % investigator .80 power detect effect size delta = .28 great .</detailed_description>
