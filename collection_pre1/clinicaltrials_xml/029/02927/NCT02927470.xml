	<brief_summary>The purpose study understand brain allows individual keep information `` mind '' brief interval . During experiment , participant ask maintain fixation attend remember different visual stimulus ( e.g. , location dot screen , color circle , orientation line , speed group move dot ) computer monitor . Participants make decision visual stimulus indicate decision press button make eye movement . Through use Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( TMS ) investigator hope understand contribution different anatomical area subject perform task .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study use within subject design participant perform work memory task combine Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation . TMS apply three possible procedure , 1 ) Online TMS , 2 ) Offline TMS 3 ) Sham TMS . All subject give two trial within one session , one sham TMS subject another randomly assign either Online Offline TMS . Trials order randomly counterbalance across subject , blind treatment frontal vs. sham TMS ( independent variable ) . Participants randomize either online offline group computer generate list ensure equal number participant condition . Half subject receive online TMS ( online group ) half receive offline TMS ( offline group ) . Subjects randomly assign one two group . The dependent variable performance accuracy reaction time work memory task . By utilize online offline TMS , investigator able explore whether frontal cortex involve transiently visual work memory persistently throughout task .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Neurologically healthy individual recruit . Individuals neurological issue ( e.g. , history seizure , neurosurgery , brain trauma ) exclude . Women childbearing potential tell although know risk procedure unborn fetus , take part study might pregnant . Minors elderly exclude . Individuals medication heighten risk TMS adverse event exclude .</criteria>
