	<brief_summary>This research study study drug possible treatment ALK-positive ROS1-positive non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . The following drug involve study : - Lorlatinib</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Lorlatinib Advanced ALK ROS1 Rearranged Lung Cancer With CNS Metastasis Absence Measurable Extracranial Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study Phase II clinical trial . Phase II clinical trial test safety effectiveness investigational drug learn whether drug work treat specific disease . `` Investigational '' mean drug study . The FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve Lorlatinib treatment disease . All participant study receive Lorlatinib . Lorlatinib target abnormal ALK ROS1 proteins NSCLC cell . Lorlatinib test research study result show medicine may help control growth NSCLC even spread CNS . The CNS term use refer brain spinal cord , include line brain spinal cord call meninges . In research study , investigator try determine whether lorlatinib effective control growth cancer cell spread CNS . Another purpose study determine cancer cell spread participant CNS continue grow despite treatment drug . For reason , blood sample collect part study ass DNA release participant cancer cell blood cell travel site body .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically cytologically confirm diagnosis metastatic NSCLC ( Stage IV , American Joint Committee Cancer v7.0 ) carry ALK rearrangement , determine Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve FISH test , use Vysis® ALK Break apart fluorescence situ hybridization ( FISH ) Probe Kit ( define 15 % positive tumor cell ) , Ventana® immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) test , ROS1 rearrangement determine FISH reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RTPCR ) Next Generation Sequencing ( NGS ) via local diagnostic test ( LDT ) . ALK positive NSCLC patient must either treatment naive advance set disease progression intolerance least 1 previous ALK inhibitor . ROS1 positive NSCLC patient must either treatment naive advance set disease progression intolerance least 1 previous ROS1 inhibitor . Presence radiographically suspect leptomeningeal disease ( LM ) carcinomatous meningitis ( CM ) AND/OR presence least one CNS lesion follow criterion meet : For patient without leptomeningeal disease : presence least one parenchymal CNS lesion least 5 mm size . Note : Intracranial disease assessment perform use contrastenhanced magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . MRI scan slice 1 mm necessary brain metastasis 5 10 mm size . The lesion ( ) must newly diagnose present progression local therapy , include surgery and/or radiation therapy . For patient receive local therapy , progression preexist lesion base RECIST v1.1 ( &gt; 20 % increase long diameter baseline scan ) new lesion require . Participants receive corticosteroid must stable decrease dose least 2 week prior first dose study treatment . For patient suspect LM CM base imaging , spinal fluid sample confirmation require . For patient undergo spinal fluid sampling , negative spinal fluid ( CSF ) eligible enter . Age ≥ 18 year Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ≤2 ( Karnofsky ≥60 % ) Life expectancy ≥ 12 week , opinion investigator Adequate hematologic function , include : Platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/L Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1,500/µL Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL Adequate renal function , include : Serum creatinine ≤1.5x upper limit normal ( ULN ) estimate glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) calculate use Modification Diet Renal Disease ( MDRD ) equation least 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 Adequate pancreatic function , include : Serum lipase ≤ 1.5x ULN Adequate liver function , include : Total serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5x ULN Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) ≤ 3.0x ULN absence know metastatic involvement liver AST ALT ≤ 5.0x ULN metastatic liver involvement . Alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5x ULN absence know bone metastases ≤ 5.0x ULN case bone metastasis . After progression intolerance prior ALK ROS inhibitor therapy : A minimum washout period least 5 halflives last dose ALK ROS inhibitor therapy first dose study treatment require . A shorter washout period may consider event disease flare , discussion Sponsor . Patients must recover treatment toxicity ≤ Grade 1 pretreatment level except adverse event ( AEs ) investigator 's judgment constitute safety risk patient . Patients either chemotherapynaive receive least one line platinumbased chemotherapy locally advance metastatic disease . Acute effect therapy must resolve baseline severity CTCAE grade ≤1 except AEs investigator 's judgment constitute safety risk patient . Recovery effect major surgery significant traumatic injury least 28 day first dose study treatment For woman childbearing potential , negative pregnancy test must obtain baseline visit start study treatment . For woman postmenopausal ( ≥ 12 month nontherapyinduced amenorrhea ) surgically sterile ( absence ovary and/or uterus ) : agreement remain abstinent use two adequate method contraception , include least one method failure rate &lt; 1 % per year , treatment period least 90 day last dose study drug . Abstinence acceptable line prefer usual lifestyle patient . Periodic abstinence ( e.g. , calendar , ovulation , symptothermal , postovulation method ) withdrawal acceptable method contraception . Examples contraceptive method failure rate &lt; 1 % per year include tubal ligation , male sterilization , hormonal implant , establish , proper use combine oral injected hormonal contraceptive , certain intrauterine device . Alternatively , two method ( e.g. , two barrier method condom cervical cap ) may combine achieve failure rate &lt; 1 % per year . Barrier method must always supplement use spermicide . For men : agreement remain abstinent use barrier method contraception ( e.g. , condom ) treatment period least 90 day last dose study drug agreement refrain donate sperm period Men pregnant partner must agree remain abstinent use condom duration pregnancy . Abstinence acceptable line prefer usual lifestyle patient . Periodic abstinence ( e.g. , calendar , ovulation , symptothermal , postovulation method ) withdrawal acceptable method contraception .
