	<detailed_description>Excessive inappropriate use antibiotic one important reason development resistant bacteria . One key strategy curb development antibiotic resistance promote intervention primary care level 90 % antibiotic prescribe general practitioner - especially patient suffer respiratory tract infection . The main bacteria cause respiratory tract infection S. pneumoniae Haemophilus influenzae . The first one associate significant increase morbidity mortality Latin America . Approximately 80 % respiratory tract infection viral cause , harmless self-limiting case patient recover without specific treatment . Antibiotic treatment superfluous case even harmful side effect . Infections cause resistant bacteria lead increase mortality , prolong hospital stay social collateral damage . Therefore , 2013 World Economic Forum point antibiotic resistance one three important threat economic social development . The World Health Organisation ( WHO ) launch 20121 global strategy hold back antimicrobial resistance . According strategy `` battle infectious disease far . Not continue cause large number infection death , particularly develop country , emergence spread antimicrobial resistance also threaten undermine ability treat infection save life '' . The WHO propose number initiative emergence resistant bacteria , include intervention promote proper use antibiotic . HAPPY AUDIT II ( HA-II ) - PART OF THE SOLUTION HAPPY AUDIT - II second phase HAPPY AUDIT - I , project fund European Union promote appropriate use antibiotic 6 country heterogeneous pattern consumption antibiotic prevalence resistant strain . 440 general practitioner register data winter 2008 2009 . Inappropriate antibiotic use reduce 10 % pathology acute bronchitis , 50 % reduction use antibiotic . In Argentina , 48 general practitioner participate whole process reach 30 % reduction unnecessary prescription antibiotic patient acute bronchitis , sinusitis pharyngitis . The positive experience first phase show importance potential spread project provinces Argentina South American country . Our prior knowledge use HAPPY AUDIT II SOUTH AMERICA plan intervention patient GPs methodology APO ( Audit Project Odense ) base : 1. self-reflection physician group discussion prescription pattern , 2. patient education , 3 . Development multi-faceted intervention . The overall purpose project promote rational use antibiotic . This achieve follow specific objective : 1 . Preparation intervention material patient professional . 2 . Implementation APO cycle 4 country . 3 . Initial registration GPs use antibiotic RTI patient . 4 . Analysis result first registration identify quality problem prescription . 5 . Development multifaceted intervention . 6 . Implementation cluster randomize control trial ass effect intervention . 7 . Final registration evaluate effect intervention . PROJECT ORGANIZATION 180 GPs participate : Argentina 80 physician , Bolivia 30 physician , Paraguay 40 physician Uruguay 30 physician . The investigator use APO methodology , base `` bottom-up '' approach seek change practice behaviour among GPs . The GPs voluntarily participate set quality criterion order improve quality service . The APO method include : - Initial registration GPs activity ( 3 week ) - Intervention ( online evidence-based reminder final registration ) - Final registration evaluation ( 3 week ) Schedule 2014 February - May 2014 - coordinator researcher first meet June - August 2014 - First audit registration 15 day . October 2014 - Coordinators researcher second meeting March 2015 - Meeting General Practitioners province and/ country . This meeting divide two part : 1 . Discussion result first registration ; 2 . Discussion use quality indicator decrease inappropriate use antibiotic . June - August 2015 - Second registration , intervention ( online weekly feedback evidence-based management respiratory tract infection ) November 2016 - Assessment intervention . April 2017 - Publication result</detailed_description>
