	<brief_title>Effectiveness Dry Needling Adding Physical Therapy Patients With Chronic Non-Specific Neck Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Neck pain costly high prevalent problem . Current evidence show pain education , exercise manual therapy recommend treat patient chronic non-specific neck pain , use dry needling study adequately combination therapy . Previous trial show dry needling effectiveness reduce neck pain short medium term . However , study limitations small sample size follow-up time reduce . A clinical trial multimodal treatment method consistent clinical practice need determine effect dry needling individual non-specific neck pain . Purpose : The purpose randomize clinical trial verify effectiveness addition dry needling individual non-specific neck pain receive multimodal physical therapy rehabilitation program compare individual receive multimodal physical therapy rehabilitation program without use dry needling . Design : randomize single blind placebo control trial conduct trial accordance CONSORT guideline . Patients ( n=116 ) non-specific neck pain randomize receive 1 ) pain education , manual therapy , exercise ( n=58 ) 2 ) pain education , manual therapy , exercise dry needling ( n=58 ) . Participants receive 4-6 treatment 4 week . Clinical outcome ( pain intensity , disability , global perceive effect , self-efficacy , quality sleep catastrophizing ) obtain follow-up appointment four , twelve twenty-four week randomisation . Methods : The primary outcome pain ( measure 11-point numerical pain rating scale ) disability ( measure Neck Disability Index ) measure four week randomization . Secondary outcome pain disability twelve twenty-four week randomization global perceive effect ( measure global perceive rating scale ) , self-efficacy ( measure pain self-efficacy questionnaire ) , quality sleep ( measure Pittsburgh quality index ) , catastrophizing ( measure pain catastrophizing scale ) measure four week , twelve week twenty-four week randomization registration adverse event ( 24h , 27h four week randomization ) . Data Analysis : All outcome assess follow intention-to-treat principle . For outcome , linear mixed model employ contain term participant , treatment center , group , time group time interaction . Known prognostic factor increase disability chronic neck pain treat potential confounders , presence group imbalance despite random allocation , treat covariates outcome . For primary outcome , p &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant . For secondary outcome , p &lt; 0.01 consider statistically significant . Significance : result study provide new information clinical application dry needle additional component management non-specific neck pain .</detailed_description>
