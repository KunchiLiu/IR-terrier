	<brief_summary>Currently , efficacious behavioral treatment approach address uncompensated aspiration , aspiration without appropriate cough response , Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) . This particular public health concern give aspiration pneumonia lead cause death person PD . The overarch aim propose study determine efficacy two distinct intensive rehabilitation paradigm , expiratory muscle strength training ( EMST ) sensorimotor treatment airway protection ( smTAP ) , airway protective clinical outcome person PD dysphagia . The investigator anticipate result lead reduction risk associate airway protective deficit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Novel Management Airway Protection Parkinson 's Disease : A Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Rationale : Aspiration pneumonia lead cause death person Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) . One main reason people PD develop aspiration pneumonia often swallow dysfunction ( dysphagia ) cough dysfunction ( dystussia ) . Because , food liquid enters airway , cough elicit material remain airway ( silent aspiration ) . It possible material enter lung result infection call aspiration pneumonia . Currently , test treatment approach specifically target silent aspiration . Hypothesis : The goal study determine well two different rehabilitation treatment , expiratory muscle strength training ( EMST ) sensorimotor treatment airway protection ( smTAP ) , work improve cough swallowing function person PD dysphagia . Study Design : This study include two participant group ; one group receive EMST receive smTAP . There initial baseline test swallowing , cough , respiratory , laryngeal function . The investigator also measure participant ' perception cough swallow problem . Then , participant randomly assign ( much like flip coin ) either EMST smTAP train group . The participant randomize receive immediate training delay train 5-week wait start second baseline perform end 5-week delay . Once train complete participant complete measure swallow , cough , respiratory laryngeal function . Impact Diagnosis/Treatment Parkinson 's Disease : The investigator anticipate study assist good understanding treatment work best improve swallow cough people PD ; result immediate shift clinical management swallow cough dysfunction PD . The investigator also believe participant improvement swallow cough function ; therefore , reduce risk aspiration pneumonia .</detailed_description>
