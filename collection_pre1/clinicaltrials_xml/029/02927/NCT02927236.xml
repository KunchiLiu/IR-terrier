	<brief_summary>Background : More effective treatment people cocaine use disorder need . Researchers want understand part brain involve disorder . Transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) stimulate part brain . A form TMS call intermittent theta-burst stimulation ( iTBS ) may help reduce cocaine use . Researchers want learn brain might change treatment . Objectives : To test iTBS reduce cocaine use . Also , learn cocaine change heart brain . Eligibility : Healthy , right-handed adult age 18-60 cocaine use disorder . Design : Participants screen : - Questionnaires - Medical history - Physical exam - Blood urine test - Alcohol breath test In pilot study , 10 participant cocaine use disorder 10 treatment day 2 week . Half inpatient half outpatient . They 2 follow-up visit . Treatment include : - iTBS : A coil place head . A brief electrical current pass coil . They view cocaine-related image session . Sessions videotape . - Repeat screening test - In main study , participant randomly assign either real fake iTBS . - Participants cocaine use disorder join incentive program quit . - Participants 39 visit 6 month . These include : - Repeat screening test - MRIs 5 visit : Participants lie table slide cylinder take picture brain . They respond image scanner . - iTBS 10 visit ( 5 day week 2 week ) Participants contact throughout study discus iTBS treatment drug use .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives : Illicit drug use affect ten million Americans cost nearly $ 200 billion annually health care cost lose productivity . Cocaine dependence account 25 % report lifetime drug dependence though successfully abstain treatment . For effort toward positive long-term outcome , imperative identify risk factor poor outcome , specialized treatment , neural mechanism change treatment , predictive measure treatment outcomes . Substance abuser know dysregulation cue reactivity , reward processing , executive control , intrinsic network connectivity . Non-invasive brain stimulation ( NIBS ) proven effective reduce drug crave nicotine , alcohol , cocaine user . Here , intermittent theta-burst stimulation ( iTBS ) , type NIBS , deliver left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( dlPFC ) implement modulate substance abuse relate circuit dysregulations assess effectiveness iTBS promote abstinence . Study population : Recruitment Baltimore , Maryland area take place protocol . For Pilot , 20 cocaine dependent ( CD ) individual recruit . For Clinical Trial , 50 healthy adult ( HC ) 100 CD individual recruit . All HC group receive active- sham-iTBS within-subject crossover design . Half CD group receive active-iTBS half receive sham-iTBS . The Clinical Trial group match demographic measure ( e.g. , age , IQ , sex ) . Design : The Pilot design tolerability pilot iTBS parameter assess CD participant . The first half Pilot participant inpatient ( initial close observation ) second half outpatient ( closely reflect clinical trial ) . Throughout Pilot , clinical measure collect participant closely monitor . The general outline Clinical Trial characterize treatment cohort ( vs. HC ) ass effectiveness iTBS leave dlPFC reduce cocaine use . The iTBS intervention consist 30 session 2-week ( 10 treatment day ) period add-on treatment-as-usual , contingency management . Structural functional magnetic resonance imaging , neural measure cue reactivity , reward processing , executive control , intrinsic network connectivity along cardiac measure collect identify difference CD HC participant baseline . In CD participant , neural cardiac measure along cocaine use track longitudinally assess change treatment . Contingency management continue 13 week 3-month follow-up schedule . The Clinical Trial include 39 visit . Outcome parameter : Two main comparison interest . First , baseline difference neural cardiac measure CD HC participant identify . CD participant expect show dysregulations function , relative HC participant . Second , neural plasticity relate function due iTBS treatment reduction cocaine use measure . The active-iTBS intervention expect effective reduce cocaine use , relative sham-iTBS intervention . Normalization circuit dysregulation hypothesize associate reduction cocaine use . Overall , current protocol design test whether iTBS leave dlPFC efficacious reduce cocaine use .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA TOLERABILITY PILOT : 1 . Be able give valid inform consent . 2 . Be 18 60 year age . 1 . Justification : Many neural process change age , change could introduce unwanted variability behavioral MRI signal . 2 . Screening tool : Selfreport . Governmentissued form identification ( e.g . driver license , birth certificate ) 3 .Righthanded . 1 . Justification : Differences hemispheric dominance could confound iTBS administration MRI measurement . 2 . Screening tool : Edinburgh Handedness Inventory . 4 . Be good health . 1 . Justification : Many illness may alter neural function well fMRI signal . 2 . Screening tool : Medical Assessment , Medical History Physical Examination . Medical assessment include : Vital Signs , EKG , oral HIV test , height/weight measurement , urinalysis , blood sample . Tests blood sample include CBC , complete metabolic profile , TSH , ESR , syphilis test , HIV ( need confirm positive salivary test HIV ) . The follow individual laboratory result independently disqualify individual : Cholesterol &gt; 250 mg/dl , Hemoglobin &lt; 10 g/dl , WBC &lt; 2400/microliter , LFTs &gt; 3 X upper normal limit , HCG positive , Casual serum glucose &gt; 200 mg/dl , Urine protein &gt; 1+ , HIV positive . ( Serum glucose 140 mg/dl follow fast serum glucose assessment . Those fast glucose 100 mg/dl may consider protocol . Others reject referred workup . ) Liver function evaluate aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) alanine transaminase ( ALT ) . A great 3 x upper normal limit AST ALT disqualify individual . MAI reserve right exclude less extreme lab value clinical judgment warrant exclusion . 5 . Absence specific learn disability , ADHD cognitive impairment 1 . Justification : Participants must able perform cognitively challenge task high standard . 2 . Screening tool : Adult ADHD SelfReport Scale follow clinical interview , Wechsler Abbreviated Scale Intelligence ( WASI ) , History placement special education class learn problem . 6 . Participants meet DSM5 criterion current moderate severe substance ( i.e. , cocaine ) use disorder , without period continuous abstinence last onemonth period last year , control environment , seek treatment . 1 . Justification : cocaine use disorder , regular user , focus protocol . 2 . Screening tool : Potential diagnosis evaluate counselor use one following : Drug Use Survey , SCID Screen Patient Questionnaire , Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview ( M.I.N.I ) , Addiction Severity Index , Brief Cocaine Cessation Motivation Assessment . The interviewer supplement SCID question assess DSM5 substance use disorder . The MAI may consult determination . EXCLUSION CRITERIA TOLERABILITY PILOT : 1 . History neurological disorder would increase seizure risk iTBS stroke , brain lesion , previous neurosurgery , history seizure faint episode unknown cause , head trauma result loss consciousness , last 30 minute sequela last long one month . 1 . Justification : Stroke , vascular lesion head trauma low seizure threshold , therefore contraindication iTBS . Fainting episode syncope unknown cause could indicate undiagnosed condition associate seizure . 2 . Screening tool : TMS safety Screen , Medical History clinical MRI/MRA scan . 2 . Current DSM5 moderatesevere substance use disorder substance cocaine , nicotine , marijuana meeting withdrawal criterion alcohol sedative/hypnotic/anxiolytic , tolerance criterion individual use 3 days/week , regardless diagnosis . 1 . Justification : While use multiple substance norm use allow , focus current protocol cocaine . However , participant tolerance withdrawal symptom alcohol sedative/hypnotic/anxiolytic increase risk seizure iTBS therefore exclude . 2 .
