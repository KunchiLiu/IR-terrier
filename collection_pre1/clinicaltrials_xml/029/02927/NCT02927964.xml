	<brief_summary>This phase Ib/II trial study side effect best dose toll-like receptor 9 ( TLR9 ) agonist SD-101 give together ibrutinib radiation therapy see well work treat patient grade 1-3a follicular lymphoma come back period improvement long respond treatment . Immunostimulants TLR9 agonist SD-101 may increase ability immune system fight infection disease . Ibrutinib may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Radiation therapy use high energy x-ray kill tumor cell shrink tumor . Giving TLR9 agonist SD-101 ibrutinib radiation therapy may induce immune response prolong anti-tumor response .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine recommended phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) intratumoral TLR9 agonist SD-101 ( SD-101 ) combination ibrutinib radiation patient relapse refractory low-grade follicular lymphoma . ( Phase Ib ) II . To determine safety tolerability SD-101 combination ibrutinib radiation patient relapse refractory low-grade follicular lymphoma . ( Phase Ib ) III . To evaluate efficacy intratumoral SD-101 combination ibrutinib radiation patient relapse refractory low-grade follicular lymphoma assess overall response rate . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate progression-free survival treatment intratumoral SD-101 combination ibrutinib radiation patient relapse refractory low-grade follicular lymphoma . ( Phase II ) OUTLINE : This phase Ib , dose-escalation study TLR9 agonist SD-101 follow phase II study . Patients undergo radiation therapy day 1 2 . Within 12 hour completion radiation therapy , patient receive TLR9 agonist SD-101 intratumorally ( IT ) day 2 day 9 , 16 , 23 , 30 . Patients also receive ibrutinib orally ( PO ) daily begin day 10 96 week absence disease progression unexpected toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3-6 month .</detailed_description>
