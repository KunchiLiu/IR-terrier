	<brief_summary>This study design utilize whole exome whole genome sequence technique identify underlying genetic cause undiagnosed disorder Plain Communities , population genetic study look genetic drift founder mutation unique population .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exome Genome Analysis Elucidate Genetic Etiologies Population Characteristics Plain Community</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The long term goal proposal establish Translational Medicine Program Old Order Amish Mennonite community accessible member decrease cost effective diagnostic strategy , leverage genetic information obtain well understand genetic force risk drive health population . As bridge , next-generation sequence technology use identify genetic defect Old Order Amish families/individuals clinical picture suggestive Mendelian disorder unknown diagnosis . Investigators plan develop targeted analytical NGS panel optimize general use clinical setting deal Plain Communities patient family , yield well prompt clinical intervention improvement outcomes . The study also involve use whole genome sequence mutant allele discovery platform identify novel genetic risk population yet identify patient , use platform describe genetic difference Old Order Amish community across Pennsylvania ultimately across country . With WGS use analyze population genetics compare distribution genetic variant among various Amish community compare European ancestry variant available 1000 genome project , study influence founder-selection genetic drift population .</detailed_description>
