	<brief_summary>Danirixin ( DNX ) novel , selective , reversible antagonist C-X-C chemokine receptor ( CXCR ) 2 show decrease neutrophil transmigration activation area inflammation . An intravenous ( IV ) formulation DNX hydrobromide ( HBr ) develop anti-inflammatory agent treatment adult hospitalize influenza ( IFV ) . While early therapy antiviral decrease severity duration symptom influenza , drug demonstrate clinical efficacy randomize clinical trial population . Current treatment guideline hospitalize IFV recommend neuraminidase inhibitor standard care therapy . IFV study animal demonstrate therapeutic treatment combination CXCR2 antagonist neuraminidase inhibitor reduce lung neutrophil show trend improvement clinical score , lung function pathology evidence worsen outcome , include viral load . This Phase 2 , randomize , double-blind ( IV DNX ) , placebo-controlled ( IV DNX ) 3-arm study first study determine efficacy safety IV DNX co-administered ( group ) standard care antiviral treatment ( open-label oral oseltamivir [ OSV ] ) subject hospitalized IFV . The primary objective study assess efficacy treatment IV DNX twice daily give oral OSV compare oral OSV twice daily time clinical response ( TTCR ) . In study , subject randomized 2:2:1 ratio 15 milligram ( mg ) free base equivalent ( FBE ) IV DNX , 50 mg FBE IV DNX , match placebo twice daily . All subject also receive open-label 75 mg oral OSV , twice daily ( give standard care ) . The study treatment duration 5 day . The investigator may elect continue treatment OSV 5 day study treatment . Follow continue Day 45 subject . The study begin enhance safety monitoring sentinel cohort , lead stepwise enrollment subject . Subjects enrol base increase level renal impairment , less severe hospitalize subject enrol prior enrollment critically ill subject , first study conduct hospitalized population severe IFV . Approximately 300 subject target enrol study .</brief_summary>
