	<detailed_description>There grow recognition acute hospitalization contributes mark functional decline old adult . Nearly 20 % hospitalize old adult discharge skilled nursing facility ( SNF ) address functional deficit . However , rehabilitation SNFs may adequately restore physical function , potentially contribute poor community discharge rate . Strikingly , 37 % patient admit SNFs discharge community setting , suggest paradigm shift require optimize rehabilitation within SNFs . Currently , usual care rehabilitation SNFs consist low-intensity rehabilitation intervention , physiologically inadequate induce meaningful change skeletal muscle strength physical function . Therefore , investigator propose novel `` IntenSive Therapeutic Rehabilitation Older skilled NursinG HomE Residents '' ( I-STRONGER ) program , integrate principle physiologic tissue overload combine strengthen functional intervention great gain physical function . The overall goal investigation 1 ) demonstrate feasibility I-STRONGER SNF settings 2 ) determine effectiveness I-STRONGER improve physical function . A comparison usual care ( UC ) I-STRONGER occur use stag , 2 group design ( independent cohort ) , single SNF serve control . The first cohort SNF patient participate UC ( Stage 1 ) therapist training ISTRONGER complete , second cohort patient enter facility participate I-STRONGER ( Stage 2 ) . The feasibility I-STRONGER evaluate patient acceptability therapist compliance measure . Sample size estimate ( use patient mobility deficits home health setting ) suggest least 86 participant necessary adequately power . Heterogeneity sample re-evaluated study period use SNF data sample size estimate may adjust appropriate .</detailed_description>
