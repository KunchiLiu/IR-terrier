	<brief_title>The Effect Pregabalin Pain Related Walking Patients With Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pregabalin ( LYRICAÂ® ) potent specific ligand alpha-2-delta subunit voltage-gated calcium channel . It currently approve adjunctive therapy neuropathic pain condition . Patients diabetic peripheral neuropathy suffer pain foot interfere ability walk include less walking , alter gait , alter balance . At night peripheral neuropathy also interfere sleep patterns.The hypothesis study pregabalin , 150 mg bid , reduce general daytime pain patient diagnose diabetic peripheral neuropathy also reduce level pain associate walking . Consequently , hypothesize reduction pain result increase amount walk day , improvement gait , balance , risk fall sleep patterns.Pain sleep quality assess questionnaire objective measurement use assess gait , balance , daytime activity ( include walk ) sleep pattern . Statistical Power Calculations base fact randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , 2-period crossover study conduct single site . Comparisons draw baseline , completion 6 week treatment/placebo arm . The study power 0.80 two-tail analysis sensitivity detect 30 % delta pain perception 40 subject . From previous study , cross-over design suggest achieved significance 20 patient per group . Forty-four patient recruited total . Significance establish alpha level 0.05 . Both parametric non parametric correlation carry different variable measure progressive logistic regression determine relative contribution pain relief primary secondary variable measure study .</detailed_description>
