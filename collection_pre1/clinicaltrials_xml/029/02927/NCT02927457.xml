	<brief_summary>This study design examine safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamics clinical effect repeat dose GSK2646264 patient subacute chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus ( CLE ) lesion acute CLE like lesion induce photoprovocation ( PV ) . Current study two group study . In Group A , Patients few two active lesion enrol expose photoprovocation ( PV ) 3 consecutive day . Patients develop PV lesion time period , determine local investigative team , receive 1 % strength GSK2646264 1 lesion placebo 1 lesion daily either 1 % strength GSK2646264 placebo area uninvolved skin , skin pharmacokinetic ( PK ) study drug , 28 day . In Group B , Patients minimum 2 active exist CLE lesion determine investigator enrol group B one lesion treat 1 % GSK2646264 1 lesion placebo . A complete patient define subject receives least 25 day study drug completes end treatment biopsy ( day 28 ) assessment . Thereafter patient follow 28 day Group A complete resolution induce PV lesion , determine investigator .</brief_summary>
