	<brief_title>Intraoperative Electron Beam Radiotherapy Boost Treating Patients With Stage I-II Breast Cancer Undergoing Surgery With Reconstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine rate grade 3 breast fibrosis 1 year woman undergo lumpectomy oncoplastic reconstruction immediate intraoperative electron radiotherapy boost follow adjuvant whole breast radiotherapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine rate 5 year ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence rate . II . To determine change self-reported cosmesis use Breast Cancer Treatment Outcome Scale ( BCTOS ) questionnaire . III . To evaluate physician-reported cosmetic outcome use 4-point Harvard Cosmesis Scale digital photograph . OUTLINE : Patients undergo standard care lumpectomy undergo 1 fraction intraoperative electron beam radiation therapy ( IOERT ) boost lumpectomy cavity . Patients undergo standard care oncoplastic reconstruction whole breast radiation therapy . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 month , 6 month , 1 year , every year thereafter 5 year .</detailed_description>
