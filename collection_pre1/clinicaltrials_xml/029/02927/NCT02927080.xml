	<brief_title>Study ACE-083 Patients With Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy ( FSHD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Part 1 ( dose escalation , open-label ) Part 1 consist 6 cohort ( A F ) patient evaluate multiple ascend dose level ACE-083 either tibialis anterior ( TA ) biceps brachii ( BB ) muscle . Patients cohort enrol 4-week screening period begin treatment . A Safety Review Team ( SRT ) meet review data cohort least 4 patient within cohort complete Day 43 visit prior dose escalation . Part 2 ( randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled ) Prior initiation Part 2 , review safety efficacy data Part 1 conduct determine whether cohort one muscle pursue Part 2 , well recommend dose level muscle . A total 40 new patient ( 20 patient per muscle ) may enrol randomize ( 3:2 ) receive either ACE-083 ( n=12 ) placebo ( n=8 ) unilaterally bilaterally ( side affect per inclusion criterion ) either TA BB muscle ( ) . The SRT meet review Part 2 patient safety data first 10 patient reach Day 43 study approximately every 3 month thereafter . Study duration Parts 1 2 patient approximately 24 week , include 4-week screening period , 12-week treatment period , 8-week follow-up period last dose</detailed_description>
