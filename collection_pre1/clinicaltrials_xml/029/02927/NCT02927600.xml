	<brief_title>Bed Breakfast ( B &amp; B ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Consumption low Glycemic Index ( GI ) food show attenuate blood glucose response postprandial period immediately follow meal also positive metabolic effect subsequent meal , know `` second-meal effect '' reduce glucose excursion beyond actual meal . The relative importance time glycemic load variation ( e.g. , breakfast dinner ) overall , 24h , glycemic control investigate detail . We hypothesize eat low GI food single meal either breakfast dinner would different consequential effect glycemic control follow meal thereafter 24 hour . In order establish relative importance breakfast dinner predict glycemic control/response follow meal 24-hour period study use comprehensive method include Continuous Glucose Monitoring Systems ( CGMS ) well measure postprandial blood glucose insulin .</detailed_description>
