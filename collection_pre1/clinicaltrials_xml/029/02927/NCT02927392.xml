	<brief_summary>The physiological relevance brown adipose tissue ( BAT ) humans largely unknown . The investigator show suppress ovarian function premenopausal woman reduce rest energy expenditure ( REE ) , prevent add back estradiol ( E2 ) . The investigator preliminary data suggest may due , part , reduce brown adipose tissue ( BAT ) activity . The overarch hypothesis BAT activity human modulate E2 . To determine natural decline endogenous E2 contribute change BAT activity , compare BAT activity pre-and post-menopausal woman . The investigator also explore whether suppression ovarian hormone pre-menopausal woman impairs BAT activity . BAT activity quantify use dynamic positron emission topography/computed tomography ( PET/CT ) image combine 11C-acetate tracer . We assess thermogenic response BAT measure cold-induced change REE , shiver , skin core temperature .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants ask perform study measure rest metabolic rate activity brown adipose tissue brown fat . Brown fat different regular `` white fat '' produce heat burn calorie . The investigator measure active brown fat normal room temperature participant expose cold . The study last 5-6 hour . It consist measurement make warm temperature period cold exposure . For cold exposure part study , participant ask wear cool suit 3 hr . Skin temperature normally 90ยบ Fahrenheit . The cool suit adjust water temperature skin temperature 82ยบ Fahrenheit . The suit cover entire body except face , hand , foot . Participants may feel cold wear suit may shiver , base past study , shiver minor . Before cool suit turn , body scan perform use procedure call positron emission tomography ( PET ) . These scan use radiation . Before PET scan , investigator infuse radioactive tracer arm . These tracer low dose radiation show u brown fat active . One PET scan perform room temperature , second scan perform cool suit wear 3 hour . Two additional scan use compute tomography ( CT ) perform end study . CT scan like x-ray , use radiation . The radiation dose CT scan much high tracer . When CT scan combine PET scan , separate brown fat white fat . 15 pre-menopausal woman ask volunteer follow study . For 5 month , pre-menopausal woman study receive monthly injection contain study drug ( leuprolide ) reduce estrogen postmenopausal level . This drug approve FDA reduce estrogen treatment uterine fibroid endometriosis , approve use healthy woman . In study , drug use decrease hormone determine reduces brown fat activity . 6 month first injection , woman ask repeat PET/CT study .</detailed_description>
