	<detailed_description>This descriptive phase I trial ass safety immunogenicity RH5.1/AS01 vaccine healthy volunteer different dos , establish whether RH5.1/AS01 vaccine demonstrate reduce parasite multiplication rate vaccinate subject compare infectivity control blood-stage control human malaria infection model . There 6 study group across two phase trial , total 66 - 78 volunteer . Vaccination group sequential Group 1 Group 3 . Group 3 4 recruit simultaneously . Volunteers able choose group allocate . The vaccination dose Group 5 decide follow analysis safety exploratory immunology assay Groups 1 , 2 4 . They undergo blood-stage CHMI 2 - 4 week final vaccination follow approximately 6 month final vaccination . Group 6 volunteer infectivity control , receive vaccination . Volunteers recruit undergo screen visit , vaccination clinic visit post-vaccination local trial site . Procedures perform visit time point indicate schedule attendances..
