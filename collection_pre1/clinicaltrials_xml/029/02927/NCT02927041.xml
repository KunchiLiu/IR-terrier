	<brief_summary>The gold standard hemodynamic evaluation combine use echocardiography right heart catheterization . Fall back echocardiography time consumption requirement specialist interpretation Swan-Ganz® catheter show poor correlation central venous pressure volume status provide indirect difficult interpret measurement patient unique pathophysiological state . Next generation continuous hemodynamic transesophageal echocardiography ( hTEE® ) increasingly utilized assist complex resuscitation monitor hemodynamic profile critically ill patient . hTEE prove essential diagnostic , therapeutic monitoring tool rapid evaluation hemodynamic state critically ill patient hemodynamically compromised patient . The purpose observational study evaluate role hTEE clinical decision-making 30 patient recruit OR-Trauma 30 patient Cardiovascular-OR . Hemodynamic trans-esophageal echocardiography ( hTEE ) incorporate FDA-approved miniaturized , disposable probe continuous use patient 72 hour . This device use postoperative assessment ICU several year successful placement probe without adverse incident . The probe allow rapid , intermittent continuous evaluation bi-ventricular function , volume status valve function bedside intraoperatively . It also allow evaluation pericardial effusion exclusion pericardial tamponade .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The device evaluate trans-valvular flow well valvular regurgitation use color flow function . In many situation hTEE enables image feasible transthoracic echocardiography due wound , dressing , line edema . The hTEE provide visual acuity detail formal TEE , advantage require significantly small probe ( hence decrease risk possible injury ) ability provide rapid , repeatable sequential assessment caregiver intraoperatively bedside . Data review outcome measure compare efficiency , accuracy clinical decision making capability FDA approve hTEE cardiac monitoring system vs. standard care Swan-Ganz/ echocardiographic information publication . The ultimate goal demonstrate whether implementation probe surgical trauma CVICU patient , difference : 1 . Mortality Morbidity 2 . Organ dysfunction failure 3 . Blood product administration 4 . Length ICU stay 5 . Hospital stay 2 . Study Design Statistical Procedures This two phase , single center , non-blinded , non-randomized , observational retrospective study carry Memorial Hermann Hospital . The data hTEE study group compare control group ( in-house OR-Trauma CV surgery database ) analyze patient patient basis impact clinical decision-making . Based upon literature review , hypothesize hTEE help guide point-of-care management upwards 75 percent case . A decrease iatrogenic complication inappropriate blood product administration , volume resuscitation drug intervention base antiquated protocol inaccurate technology expect . Its use may benefit hospital financially decrease incidence organ failure mortality allow fulfillment discharge criterion earlier hospital . 3 . Study Procedures 1 . Initiation A .
