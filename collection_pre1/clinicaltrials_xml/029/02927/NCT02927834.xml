Oral steroid benefit patient chronic rhinosinusitis nasal polyp ( CRSwNP ) however role non polyp patient less clear . It goal study see oral steroid benefit treatment outcome patient chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyp . In addition study look see short course ( 5 day burst ) versus long course ( 21 day taper ) oral steroid make difference outcome .</brief_summary>
