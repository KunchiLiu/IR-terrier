	<detailed_description>This single dose , dose-ranging study conduct two center : Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute Harbor-UCLA Medical Center University Washington . Single dose DMAU castor oil/benzyl benzoate injection intramuscularly ( IM ) ( 80 mg , 240 mg , 800 mg ) administer subcutaneously ( SC ) ( 50 mg , 100 mg 200 mg ) select dose-escalating study . Twelve subject complete study DMAU dose ( 10 DMAU 2 placebo injection ) yield total 72 complete subject ( 60 DMAU 12 placebo ) across site . Safety assess subject recovery assess two subject receive low dos , either IM SC , additional men receive high dos IM SC DMAU . In addition safety tolerability , suppression serum T , E2 , gonadotropin , SHBG also assess secondary pharmacodynamic ( PD ) endpoint . PK DMAU DMA assess blood draw do visit . Suppression spermatogenesis assess semen analysis . DMAU injection administer study site train research nurse physician . For intramuscular injection , staff inject DMAU castor oil slowly gluteal region avoid injection blood vessel follow standard procedure intramuscular injection steroid . Subcutaneous injection do slowly abdomen skin ensure drug dispense tissue layer skin muscle follow standard procedure subcutaneous injection .
