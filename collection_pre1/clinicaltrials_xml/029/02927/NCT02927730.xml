	<brief_title>The Correlation Between Clinical Diagnosis Retained Placenta And Histology</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Retained product conception ( RPOC ) common treatable complication delivery termination pregnancy . The reported incidence literature around 1 % pregnancy . Most often , diagnosis make clinical basis scarce information available related correlation clinical pathological diagnosis RPOC . The gold standard diagnosis RPOC base histopathological confirmation chorionic villus tissue derive uterus . Once RPOC diagnose clinical basis , several treatment option available , include expectant management , pharmacological treatment , surgical intervention . Given risk associated surgical intervention , accurate diagnosis vital . Guidelines Maccabi Health Care Organization mandate hysteroscopic removal suspect RPOC perform approval Gynecological Surgical Preauthorization committee . Based activity committee start 2011 , Maccabi develop database certain gynecologic-surgical procedure include hysteroscopic removal suspect RPOC . Purpose study : The main purpose evaluate correlation qualitative quantitative manner clinical diagnosis retain placenta histology . Expected result : 70 % correlation clinical pathological diagnosis RPOC . Methods : Establishing dedicated database include demographic , clinical histological data woman undergone hysteroscopic removal suspect RPOC statistical assessment correlation . Significance : Determination correlation clinical suspicion histological diagnosis retain placental tissue Finding clinical parameter may increase accuracy diagnosis help prevent unnecessary procedure .</detailed_description>
