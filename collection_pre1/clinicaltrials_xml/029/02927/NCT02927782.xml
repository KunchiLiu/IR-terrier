	<detailed_description>Patients persistent symptom cerebrospinal-fluid leakage ( positional headache , photophobia , nausea vomiting , clear drainage wound , fluctuant subcutaneous wound ) primary repair consider revision surgery avoid potentially serious complication include CSF ( cerebro spinal fluid ) fistula formation . In recent retrospective case series 42 patient Radcliff et al . report increase medical complication include pneumonia wound infection associate prolonged bed rest Current literature provide prospective retrospective evidence influence early mobilization complication reoperation rate ID ( incidental durotomy ) . Prolonged bed rest widely accept frequently apply ID . Contrarily , current literature provide support retrospective evidence prolong bed rest may require watertight closure dural tear . The purpose study investigate impact prolong bed rest need early reoperation follow primary repair ID lumbar spinal surgery . The primary endpoint study difference reoperation rate two study group investigate either one postoperative mobilisation regimen provide significant benefit term persistent dural leakage . This study design unblinded , prospective randomise cohort trial . The treatment arm consist either strict prolong bed rest 48 hour immediate postoperative mobilisation . Patients go randomise either treatment arm intraoperative verification ID . Randomization either treatment arm go perform consecutive alternating manner . The accord mobilisation regimen go prescribed surgeon perform index procedure immediately wound closure standard option institution proprietary hospital information system . Symptoms persist liquor leakage go assessed Investigator . Additional confirmation via MRI scan routinely perform persistent leakage suspect revision surgery plan . For Patients symptom persist dural leakage 48 hour course early mobilization course 24 hour bed rest administer revision surgery schedule . Various case series , well large pro- retrospective study publish describe incidence , intraoperative management well long- short term outcome ID . In addition , current literature provide retrospective evidence small case series consider benefit adverse event prolong bed rest primarily recognise repair ID . To knowledge first prospective randomise trial investigate impact immediate mobilisation incidence persistent cerebrospinal leakage .</detailed_description>
