Caregivers typically assume care responsibility without train support may turn experience multiple health risk include depression . Providing evidence-based caregiver supportive program wide scale basis identify National Alzheimer 's Plan Act national priority . One approach augment exist community-based service old adult caregiver evidence-based program . Adult day service ( ADS ) one grow critical community-based option old adult Alzheimer 's Disease relate disorder systematically address common caregiver challenge burden use evidence-based program . The purpose study : 1 ) evaluate effectiveness Adult Day Services ( ADS ) Plus improve caregiver well-being reduce depressive symptom compare routine ADS use 6 month ; 2 ) evaluate long-term maintenance effect ADS Plus 12 month caregiver well-being depressive symptom . ADS Plus consist 5 key component : care management , referral/linkage , education dementia , situational counseling/emotional support/stress reduction technique , skill manage behavioral symptom ( e.g. , rejection care , agitation , aggression ) . Based care challenge identify family caregiver , `` ADS Plus Prescription '' provide , write document detail easy-to-use strategy address specify care challenge caregiver train use . The propose study employ practical trial design ass effectiveness uptake ADS Plus large scale . Thirty ADS program throughout U.S. vary geographic location staffing level involve .

	<brief_title>Improving Outcome Family Caregivers Older Adults With Complex Conditions : The Adult Day Plus ( ADS Plus ) Program</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Family caregiver ( CGs ) provide 85 % long-term care need old adult include coordination , care transition , hands-on assistance daily care , health-related service ( e.g. , wound care , medication management ) , financial support , monitor on-site long-distance , manage challenge behavior , preserve quality life . As condition worsen , CGs assume extensive care responsibility time consuming , physically demand , emotionally deplete . Although positive aspect caregiving document , on-going caregiving source chronic stress result poor health , lose income , psychological distress , distressed , increased risk mortality . CGs typically provide care without formal support , significant unmet need , limited access knowledge skill need care older adult complex condition . To date , test CG intervention : ) focus one disease state ( e.g. , dementia ) ; b ) deliver intervention outside exist service settings/payment structure ; c ) require extensive training interventionists , ) less reach mix CGs/older person ; e ) require retool intervention enhance implementation potential real world setting ; f ) translate delivery community-settings sustain . The study potentially overcome shortcoming embed evidence-based approach service payment structure ( adult day service [ ADS ] ) , address core need diverse CGs old adult mix condition , evaluate outcomes high relevance CGs ( well-being , depression ) , old adult ( behavioral symptom ) , ADS ( day spend ADS ) society ( reduction nursing home placement ) . Adult day service grow important long-term care option . ADS important community-based long-term care option CGs old adult complex condition require daily assistance . ADS provide out-of-home , supervised , group service goal improve mood , well-being , quality life enable client remain home long possible . ADS also aim provide CGs `` respite '' day-to-day care responsibility available `` normal business hour , '' although offer flexible hour meet need work CGs . While provide support group educational opportunity , activity consistently provide , systematically integrated routine practice , evidence-based . Similarly , care planning may occur time client enrollment annually , structure , consistent contact CGs use standardized assessment evidence-based approach typically offer . The intervention evaluate , ADS Plus , evidence-driven , embed ADS work flow , systematically address unmet CG need may boost ADS benefit CGs old adult client . The primary study aim : 1 ) evaluate effectiveness ADS Plus improve CG well-being reduce depressive symptom compare routine ADS use 6 month ; 2 ) evaluate long-term maintenance effect ADS Plus 12 month CG well-being depressive symptom . Additional study aim : 3 ) evaluate whether CGs use ADS Plus likely maintain relative ADS less likely place residential setting compare routine ADS 12 month ; 4 ) estimate ADS Plus cost assess whether result net financial benefit compare usual ADS 6 12 month ; 5 ) evaluate effect ADS Plus client behavior CG efficacy upset managing symptom ; 6 ) evaluate theoretically-derived ( Reach Effectiveness Adoption Implementation Maintenance ( RE-AIM ) framework , Stress Process Model ) mediational pathway treatment change include CG acceptance staff adoption ADS Plus 12 month . Overview research design . The investigator propose two group cluster randomize trial use re-randomization mixed method combine effectiveness implementation question enhance yield translational study . This hybrid ( also call practical embed trial ) involve 30 ADS site locate across U.S. randomize two group : 15 ADS program serve treatment site provide ADS service usual ADS Plus intervention ; 15 ADS program serve control condition provide ADS usual . Prior randomization , investigator carefully examine site important variable size capacity , location ( urban , suburban , rural ) , percent participant dementia diagnosis , staff client ratio , ownership structure , long center operating . The investigator implement re-randomization technique ensure optimal balance ADS Plus control sit site-level factor . Each 30 site enroll 15-23 CGs study , expectation average 10 per site retain 6 month ( 43 % attrition project base ADS Plus pilot CG trial ) . This yield total 300 retain participant ( 150 CGs ADS Plus sit ; 150 ADS usual care site ) 2 year recruitment period . In accordance translational focus , inclusion criterion purposely broad reflect real world case mix CGs use ADS CG older relative ( &gt; 60 year ) upon initial intake enrollment participate ADS eligible study inclusion . Each 30 ADS site designate staff member serve research liaison site participate 4 hour pay training ( via webinar ) . Research liaisons responsible inform CGs ( initial intake ) study use Johns Hopkins University ( JHU ) approve Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) script , recruitment letter flyer . The Research liaison provide packet study material contain copy consent form , study flyer , study letter , consent contact sheet . CGs express study interest sign IRB approve form agree contact study staff . Caregivers receive telephone call JHU research interviewer . The interviewer explain study procedure , review consent form caregiver provide packet . If caregiver interested staff obtain verbal assent instruct caregiver sign consent form date time . If CG eligible sign consent provide verbal assent 45 minute baseline interview conduct either immediately time convenient CG yet within 1 week screening . The consent form return ADS site scan faxed JHU study staff . In previous trial , investigator find CGs attend hour telephone . The 15 ADS Plus sit also designate site interventionist backup interventionist participate one week training ( via webinar , on-line lecture ) ADS Plus protocol . For ADS Plus site , baseline interview complete JHU project director inform site interventionist contact CG begin ADS Plus ( occur within 10 day baseline interview ) . All CGs ( treatment/control ) interview via telephone JHU research staff 3 month ( interim check-in retention collect data key CG outcome ) , 6 month ( main trial outcome CG benefit ) , 12 month ( long-term outcome older adult client CG ) . To evaluate implementation process , interviewer University Minnesota ( UoM ) administer brief checklist 6 12-months CGs ( n=150 ) 15 ADS Plus sit 15 ADS Plus interventionists . Additionally , 12-months 15 ADS Plus interventionists survey use semi-structured interview telephone collect detailed process data treatment fidelity . These interview ascertain challenge success administer ADS Plus identify area refine prior ADS Plus dissemination final phase propose project . Also , conclusion randomize control trial ( RCT ) , 20 150 CGs 15 ADS Plus sit purposively sample ( base CG relationship , gender , race/ethnicity , cognitive impairment client ) participate post-RCT qualitative interview . A semi-structured telephone interview conduct UoM interviewer explore ADS Plus help ( ) perception concern effect intervention client . Description ADS Plus . Theoretical Framework - ADS Plus draws upon Pearlin et al. , stress process model iteration NIH REACH trial . These model suggest factor care need old adult , behavioral symptom , and/or CG health serve primary stressor CGs . CGs evaluate whether external demand pose potential threat older adult and/or , , whether sufficient cop mechanism . If CGs perceive external demand threaten cop resource inadequate , experience burden . The appraisal stress assume contribute negative emotional , physiological , behavioral response place CGs risk poor health , diminish wellbeing depression . Delivery Characteristics - Families setting assign intervention receive ADS usual addition ADS Plus . ADS Plus consist 5 key component : care management , referral/linkage ; disease education ; counseling/emotional support/stress reduction , care skill manage daily challenge behavioral disturbance ( e.g. , rejection care ) . Each component tailor CGs ' unmet need care context . The intervention begin two face-to-face session appoint site interventionist conduct systematic need assessment identify concern need develop agree upon care plan . The interventionist meet CGs face-to-face convenient time ( e.g. , relative brought pick ADS ) implement care plan , every week first 3 month , monthly reassessment newly emerge care concern thereafter . Contact occur minimum 1 hour per month 12 month ( face-to-face/ telephone ) . Targeted education material concern client ' condition related matter share via email traditional mail . The goal contact provide ongoing emotional support , situational counseling , education importance take care self , referrals/linkages skill ( e.g. , stress reduction , behavioral management , talk doctor ) . The care plan process collaborative flexible , reflect CG fluctuate need Usual care control group : CGs 15 site assign serve usual care control group receive ADS usual . As study intent demonstrate add value ADS Plus , compare ADS ( usual care ) appropriate reflect translational purpose propose study . Near completion study ( project year 05 ) , control group sit option receive training ADS Plus set . As CGs control site would complete study prior training , may benefit site future clients/families enrol study .</detailed_description>
