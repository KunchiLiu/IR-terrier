	<brief_title>A Study ASP2215 ( Gilteritinib ) , Administered Maintenance Therapy Following Induction/Consolidation Therapy Subjects With FMS-like Tyrosine Kinase 3 ( FLT3/ITD ) Acute Myeloid Leukemia ( AML ) First Complete Remission</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects CR1 approach study induction/consolidation therapy complete decision proceed transplantation make suitable donor could identify . Subjects randomize 2:1 ratio receive gilteritinib placebo . Subjects enter screen period 14 day prior start treatment . Subjects administer treatment continuous 28-day cycle . After treatment discontinuation , subject 30-day follow-up visit safety , subject enter long-term follow period collection subsequent AML treatment , remission status , survival ( cause death date death ) . Gilteritinib placebo give daily 2 year . Subjects follow 3 year subject 30-day follow , 80 % subject RFS event , whichever come first . Study drug provide follow-up period .</detailed_description>
