	<brief_summary>The Shoklo Malaria Research Unit ( SMRU ) provide care refugee migrant population along Thai-Burma border since 1986 . Services include antenatal birthing care , 2,500 birth per year Special Care Baby Units ( SCBU ) set 2008 ; medical record include clinical laboratory data archive . The treatment neonatal jaundice base treatment threshold adapt neonatal jaundice guideline , publish Royal College Obstetricians Gynaecologists , UK . Total serum bilirubin ( SBR ) do regular interval monitor neonatal hyperbilirubinemia ( NH ) evolution , follow SMRU guideline . The SCBU set provide intensive care neonates resource constrain set n't equipment assist ventilation oxygen therapy . Neonates present high serum bilirubin level and/or clinical sign acute bilirubin encephalopathy ( ABE ) receive exchange transfusion site refer Thai general hospital one hour drive clinic ; , neonates survive , systematic follow-up growth neurodevelopment . The study consist match case-control series retrospective review SCBU chart neonate NH reach exchange transfusion threshold . The SCBU database search neonate bear ≥ 28 week gestation hospitalize phototherapy January 2009 December 2014 ; chart manually research identify study participant classify NH reach exchange transfusion threshold ( case ) NH within moderate threshold ( control ) . Additionally neurological sign compatible ABE search clinical note cod present/absent . Cases discharge alive SCBU trace back evaluate clinical neurocognitive long term outcome . Each case match moderate NH control clinic , sex , gestational age season birth hospitalize within month . The result study help improve clinical care neonatal period develop guideline well follow-up child NH reach exchange transfusion threshold .</brief_summary>
