	<detailed_description>Opioid use disorder serious public health issue . Buprenorphine/ Naloxone ( B/N ) partial opioid mu-receptor agonist dose daily prevents opioid withdrawal , block opioid euphoria prevent opioid overdose . Extended treatment B/N increase rate abstinence outpatient treatment retention decrease Hepatitis C ( HCV ) transmission . B/N treatment dropout associate relapse overdose death . B/N adherence may critical factor influence retention reduce overall healthcare cost . Also , B/N diversion associate poor adherence become increasingly common worrisome . While many patient achieve stability start B/N treatment , 80 % 18-25 year old leave treatment within year relapse common reason . Ongoing illicit opioid use treatment increase odds relapse dropout . The MySafeRx platform help prescribers offer high level support vulnerable patient opioid use disorder period clinical instability . The MySafeRx platform combination several key component , include daily videoconferencing check-ins motivational interviewing-based recovery coaching , text-messaging reminder , secure storage B/N medication within secure electronic pill dispenser , standardize protocol supervise self-administration medication via videoconferencing . By offer recovery support medication adherence monitor program period instability , system could improve treatment outcomes ensure increase adherence , also prevent B/N diversion . This study primarily seek demonstrate feasibility MySafeRx platform among young adult ( 18-39 year , inclusive ) opioid use disorder .

Providing targeted motivational interviewing recovery support context-specific moment daily medication-taking people receptive treatment may offer new opportunity expand recovery support deliver . This study enroll patient ( 18-39 year old ) office-based opioid treatment currently prescribe buprenorphine CHA prescriber illicit-opioid positive urine screen past week receive buprenorphine induction . We start participant MySafeRx use MedicaSafe 3000 dispenser ass feasibility , acceptability , usability 30 day period . Assessments conduct baseline , two four week .</detailed_description>
