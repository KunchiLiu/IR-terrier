	<detailed_description>Background Uterine fibroid benign tumor occur commonly woman reproductive age . Symptoms uterine fibroid may heavy menstrual bleeding may lead anemia , pressure symptom , bowel symptom urinary urgency . Hysterectomy remain reference standard treatment uterine fibroid . However , may cause long-term side effect pain genitovaginal prolapse . It also carry substantial risk short term complication infection organ damage . Myomectomy another conventional treatment , associate recurrence rate high 20 % accord literature . It carry short term risk complication hysterectomy low frequency . In recent year , increase attention pay study minimally invasive non-invasive therapy uterine preservation uterine arterial embolization ( UAE ) , radiofrequency ( RF ) , microwave treatment high intensity focus ultrasound ( HIFU ) . RF ablation often require aid laparoscopic procedure , invasive . HIFU effective small myoma , time consume large myoma treatment several hour . Ultrasound computer tomography guide percutaneous microwave thermal ablation minimally invasive , low time requirement , easy perform , broadly use treatment solid tumour organ uterus favourable effect . Microwave ablation myoma endometrium perform China Japan . The effect acceptability high . The research team study China study treatment . We visit clinic studied procedure well talk patient pre- post operatively . The equipment Danderyd Hospital output effect equipment China . Danderyd Hospital approve method use uterine myoma . However , randomize comparative study minimally invasive method perform . This study aim compare effectiveness , feasibility acceptability percutaneous CT- ultrasound guide microwave ablation uterine artery embolization treatment uterine myoma randomize single blind study . Power calculation To able show difference group myoma shrinkage 6 month 75 % microwave ablation 50 % embolization group standard deviation 25 % alpha 0.05 power 80 % would need 16 woman group thus need randomize 32 woman . In order compensate loss follow-up drop total 36 woman randomize . Recruitment Randomization Women fulfil inclusion criterion without exclusion criterion identify outpatient clinic Danderyds Hospital . Advertisement may place local newspaper social medium ( Facebook Instagram ) relevant webpages gynecological clinic . Women randomize inform orally write sign informed consent fulfil inclusion exclusion criterion MRI-examination . Randomization random permute block 6 ratio 1:1 . The randomization accord computer generate randomization sequence . After patient sign informed consent fulfill inclusion without exclusion criterion initial magnetic resonance imaging allocate intervention consecutive opening seal opaque envelope contain randomization code . Blinding Patients investigator blind . The MRI perform evaluate blinded radiologist . Method Pre randomization evaluation After sign informed consent randomization patient undergo MRI uterine fibroid . Patients single fibroid measure 6cm excluded participation study . All woman include study MRI examination fill PBAC evaluation menses precede treatment . Women fill VAS maximal pain 1 month prior treatment . In addition full blood panel evaluate . As uterine artery embolization pathologist report perform treatment . Microwave ablation Microwave ablation perform percutaneously use Covidien Emprint microwave ablation system 30-60 Watts effect 14-16 gauge needle ceramic tip use computer tomography fusion technique ultrasound myoma image needle guidance . After identification needle path CT peroperative ultrasound local anaesthesia ( carbocain 1 % 0,05mg/ml adrenaline ) give along needle path small skin incision use scalpel make needle entry . Patients give intravenous anesthesia spontaneous breathe general anesthesia treatment minimize movement ablation . Uterine artery embolization Embolization perform conscious woman epidural catheter pain relief . A catheter insert femoral artery access uterine artery x-ray monitoring administration contrast visualize fibroma support arterial supply . When support arterial branch identify polyvinyl alcohol particle release bloodstream . These particle cause thrombosis vessel . Evaluation post treatment Women estimate VAS maximum postoperative pain day surgery follow 7 day . In addition note many day pass pain subside , use pain medication note period resume normal daily activity . The period hospitalization note . Menstrual blood loss ( PBAC ) note first menstruation , menstruation number 3 5 post treatment . PBAC validate instrument menstrual blood loss quantification . Follow-up visit first menstruation approximately 1 month 3 6-7 month post-treatment . At follow visit 1 , 3 month 6 month post treatment acceptability assess overall satisfaction treatment scale 1-7 woman would recommend treatment friend . A new MRI scan perform 6 month post treatment ( +/-15 day ) . Women ask participate long-term follow evaluation fibroma growth use ultrasound recurrence symptom use PBAC yearly retraction consent . Clinicial significance Uterine myoma benign disease significant impact live woman . As many 70 % woman myoma . However , self-reported frequency uterine myoma differs country range 4 % 15 % countries- probably depend use ultrasound gynecological practice information give woman . Women self report uterine myoma much likely report symptom know cause myomas heavy menstrual bleeding , pressure symptom , urinary urgency pain ( dysmenhorrea dyspareunia ) . Myomas remain leading cause hysterectomy western country . As hysterectomy highly invasive procedure cost woman term absence work short long term complication , find new minimally invasive treatment remain focus health care .</detailed_description>
