	<brief_summary>Objective : The objective study compare efficacy TENS ( transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation ) therapy conventional radiofrequency pulse radiofrequency therapy . Design : A single-blind randomized control trial Setting : An outpatient physical therapy rehabilitation clinic Subjects : The study include 60 patient present complaint chronic low back pain prevailing least 3 month diagnose facet joint syndrome . Interventions : The patient randomize 3 group Group 1 ( n : 20 ) patient would receive conventional radiofrequency therapy , Group 2 ( n : 20 ) patient conventional TENS procedure 15 day Group 3 ( n : 20 ) patient pulse radiofrequency therapy . Main measure : The patient assess treatment , month 1 6 pain ( visual analogue scale ) , disability ( Oswestry Disability Index ) , lumbar movement ( hand-floor distance ) , functional status ( 20-meter walking time , 6-min walking distance ) , quality life ( Short Form 36 ) , depression ( Beck Depression Inventory ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patient selection The study include patient present outpatient clinic unit complaint chronic low back pain prevailing least 3 month respond previous medical treatment . Medical history obtain patient low back low extremity musculoskeletal system neurologic system examine . Patients assess use two-way lumbar X-rays take within last 1 year lumbar magnetic resonance imaging outcome . After examination assessment , patient exclude study consist coagulation disorder , history malignity , mental disorder , psychiatric disorder , pregnancy , prior low back surgery , history TENS radiofrequency procedure low back region within last 1 year , advance ( grade 3-4 ) spondylolisthesis defect lumbar vertebra , extrude sequestrate disk hernia spinal narrow canal magnetic resonance imaging , cauda equine syndrome advanced paresis , examination find suggest radiculopathy pain noticeably extend knee , history systemic inflammatory disease , advance cardiac deficiency diagnosis pulmonary disease . In light medical history , examination finding test , patient think facet joint syndrome meet exclusion criterion inform study treatment procedure . The patient agree receive treatment base information give administer diagnostic test dose operate room Algology Division confirm whether present pain associate facet syndrome meeting inclusion criterion . This diagnostic procedure involve injection 0.4 cc bupivacaine fluoroscopy median dorsal ramus enable innervation lumbar facet joint . The patient whose pain recede 50 % administration test dose meet two inclusion criterion , visual analogue scale pain level &gt; 3 18-75 year age , include study . The patient include study inform write verbally purpose length study , way implementing , possible side effect problem arise . Patients sign `` subject informed consent form '' local ethic committee approval obtain . Intervention The study design prospective , randomize , single-blind study . While patient knowledge treatment , physician make assessment treatment know treatment patient receive . The randomization template obtain www . randomizer.org use randomize patient . The patient divide three group accord randomization template . Group 1 patient ( n : 20 ) administer conventional radiofrequency procedure , Group 2 patient ( n : 20 ) TENS ( transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation ) procedure Group 3 patient ( n : 20 ) pulse radiofrequency procedure . For purpose safety drug administration , vascular access establish operating room Algology Division patient would undergo diagnostic test would receive actual treatment , conventional pulse radiofrequency therapy . The patient lay supine position ; procedural site sterilize cover sterile cover . All procedure carry fluoroscopy . In conventional radiofrequency method apply Group 1 patient , target facet joint mark fluoroscope antero-posterior position . During mark , fluoroscope direct towards cephal caudal whatever level median ramus block involve endplate vertebra would become straight line . Afterwards , fluoroscope bring oblique 45 degree facet L4-5 L5-S1 30 degree upper facet . The connection point superior articular protrusion mark fluoroscope use transverse process intervention apply 22G , 10-cm radiofrequency cannula 0.5 cm active tip way bone contact establish tunneled vision technique . The intervention complete conventional radiofrequency procedure apply four level ( L2-L3 , L3-L4 , L4-L5 L5-S1 ) 80 degree 1 minute level . Group 2 patient administer TENS therapy 30 minute day 15 day outpatient physiotherapy unit Physiotherapy Rehabilitation Department . The TENS therapy apply form conventional TENS subtype 80-100 Hz frequency place four electrodes region pain intense . In pulse radiofrequency method apply Group 3 patient , target facet joint mark fluoroscope antero-posterior position . During mark , fluoroscope direct towards cephal caudal whatever level median ramus block involve endplate vertebra would become straight line . Afterwards , fluoroscope give oblique position 45 degree L4-5 L5-S1levels 30 degree upper level . The connection point vertebral corpus mark fluoroscope use transverse process intervention apply 22G , 10-cm radiofrequency cannula 0.5 cm active tip way bone contact establish tunneled vision technique . The intervention complete 45-V pulse radiofrequency procedure apply 4 level ( L2-L3 , L3-L4 , L4-L5 L5-S1 ) 42oC 4 minute level . Additionally , 3 group patient give home exercise program form lumbar range motion lumbar isometric exercise except extensional rotational movement perform least twice week throughout follow-up period . The patient phone every week encourage comply exercise program .</detailed_description>
