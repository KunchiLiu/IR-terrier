	<brief_summary>Areca nut , also know betel nut , fourth commonly consume psychoactive substance world , follow alcohol , nicotine , caffeine prevalence consumption . Although betel nut chew approximately 600 million people globally , use concentrate South Asia , Southeast Asia , Pacific Islands . Betel nut classify Group 1 carcinogen International Agency Research Cancer . Despite global significance carcinogenicity betel nut , little behavioral psychological research betel nut chewing , systematic research topic betel nut cessation intervention . The current intervention build directly upon National Institutes Health - National Cancer Institute 's U54 University Guam/University Hawaii Cancer Center Comprehensive Partnership Advance Health Equity . Previous data collect partnership suggest betel nut chewer , like smoker , generally want intend quit , specific plan quit . In addition , betel nut chewer partnership 's previous study already try quit one occasion . The finding suggest betel nut chewer could benefit cessation program model smoke cessation program . During 2014 , partnership investigator conduct feasibility study betel nut cessation program . The program well receive yield surprisingly high rate self-reported betel nut cessation . Specific Aim 1 . To test efficacy intensive group-based betel nut cessation program . Specific Aim 2 . To quantitatively determine efficacy group-based betel nut cessation intervention trial use bio-verification .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Test Effectiveness Betel Nut Cessation Program</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The general framework employ guide intervention cognitive-behavioral therapy . The cognitive-behavioral therapy goal-oriented problem-focused . The goal intervention help betel nut chewer quit chew betel nut use structured session . The cognitive component address chewer ' attitude beliefs betel nut chew . Preliminary data feasibility study reveal participant initially underestimated negative health effect betel nut . The behavioral component intervention aim replace chewing-promoting behavior behavior conducive quit betel nut stay quit , prepare response social situation pressure chew likely occur . The structure propose betel nut cessation program model specific group-based cognitive-behavioral smoking cessation program . The program select well-established evidence-based group cessation program . The intervention consist 22-day , five-session support informational group program . Betel nut use evaluate via survey bio-verification three point : initial group meeting , final group meeting , six month follow final group meeting . Group Intervention Format Procedures Five group session conduct period 22 day per cohort . Group meeting approximately one hour length conduct study investigator staff . Surveys administer first last group meeting , well six month last meeting . Surveys self-administered begin intervention session . Confidentiality emphasize meeting , especially first session , address specifically inform consent document . Participants remind participation completely voluntary withdrawal without penalty always option . At session , handout provide topical `` homework '' distribute . Saliva Samples Saliva sample ( ca . 1-2 mL ) intervention condition participant collect time three survey assessment ( baseline , final group intervention session , six-month follow-up ) . Saliva sample control condition participant ( also ca . 1-2 mL ) collect schedule intervention condition participant . From saliva sample , Dr. Adrian Franke 's laboratory measure liquid chromatography mass spectrometry level salivary biomarkers previously identify pilot study , identify compound specific areca nut betel leaf extract chew three different betel preparation . The study also reveal compound secrete saliva appear chewer ' saliva eight hour chew event . To verify self-reports betel nut abstinence , investigator set cut-offs level alkaloid specific areca nut follow : arecoline 60 ng/mL , arecaidine 10 ng/mL , guvacolin 20 ng/mL , guvacine 6 ng/mL ) . Levels value indicate evidence recent betel nut consumption . Participants whose saliva test reveal value specify cut-offs consider current chewer purpose bio-verified outcome ( i.e. , chewer non-chewer status ) . The biomarker result use compare self-reports recent chew behavior ( amount recency ) biomarker data assess dose-response effect . Saliva sample collect Guam Saipan 20 mL conical polypropylene tube initially store -20°C . Aggregated sample ship Hawaii via FedEx . Shipments perform whenever 50-60 sample successfully collect . After arrive Hawaii , sample store Dr. Adrian Franke 's lab -80°C analysis . All sample available Dr. Adrian Franke 's lab analyze one batch end annual cycle study . Survey Assessments Baseline Survey The baseline survey administer first group session . Saliva sample collect . First Follow-Up Survey The first follow-up survey administer final group session . Participants indicate attempt quit chew betel nut since start intervention program , current chewing status ( chewer ex-chewer ) , number group session attend ( reason absence , applicable ) , quid composition ( still chew ) . The participant also ask several question measure satisfaction cessation program . Saliva sample collect second time . Second Follow-Up Survey Six month post-cessation , participant arrange meet study staff complete final survey assessment . Participants ask evaluate program , well follow-up question regard current chewing status betel quid composition . Saliva sample collect final time . Measurement Cessation Outcomes Primary cessation outcome assess self-reported 7-day point prevalence abstinence bio-verified saliva test . Participants self-report chew cessation test positive betel nut biomarker classify chewer . Data Analysis The data analysis plan design direct guidance U54 Biostatistics Core . The goal analysis determine propose intervention strategy affect cessation betel nut chew . Information chew behavior collect baseline , month 1 , month 6 intervention ( IN0 , IN1 , IN6 ) control condition ( C0 , C1 , C6 ) . The efficacy cessation program assess estimation comparison cessation prevalence time , define proportion chew betel nut . The first test efficacy compare cessation status randomization group month 1 month 6 , use logistic mixed model , account repeat ( correlate ) measure within individual . The independent variable include randomization group ( define intent-to- treat ) , time ( parameterized two indicator variable ) , location ( Guam/Saipan ) , interaction term group time . Potential confounders , gender , ethnicity age , add model . The F-test interaction term 6 month test efficacy . Statistics interest model include odds ratio 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) compare randomization group , covariate-adjusted probability cessation 95 % CIs , predict group model . The data analyze within subgroup , location ( Guam Saipan ) provide information whether intervention effective select group . The investigator model treatment number session attend determine program effective compliant participant . The mixed model use available data point time point . If evidence non-random missingness , differential drop-out group , multiple imputation use determine miss data lead biased result .</detailed_description>
