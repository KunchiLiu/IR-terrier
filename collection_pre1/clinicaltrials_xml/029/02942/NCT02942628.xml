	<brief_title>Vegetarian Diet Patients With Ischemic Heart Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Cardiovascular disease lead cause death globally . Ischemic heart disease ( IHD ) contribute statistic since 1990 global burden IHD increase . It estimate 50 000 Swedish patient hospitalize every year due IHD . The risk develop IHD large extent determine existence state several modifiable risk factor include dietary habit , smoking , hypertension , diabetes mellitus , hyperlipidemia , high apolipoprotein B/ apolipoprotein A1-ratio , abdominal obesity , physical inactivity , alcohol consumption psychosocial factor . High level oxidative stress , oxidize LDL cholesterol microbial metabolite trimethylamine N-oxide TMAO suggest associate development IHD . A plant-based ( vegetarian ) diet may provide cardiovascular health benefit various mechanism . Clinical study suggest vegetarian diet positive effect low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol , oxidize LDL cholesterol , total cholesterol , triglyceride , apolipoprotein B , body mass index ( BMI ) , inflammatory marker , blood pressure , arterial intima-media thickness , insulin sensitivity , glycated hemoglobin , ( HbA1c ) fast glucose level . Through positive impact risk factor vegetarian diet associate lower incidence mortality IHD overall reduce mortality . A weakness several prior long-term controlled study compare vegetarian meat-containing diet lack well-defined control diet lead study heterogeneity . For example , subject meat-containing diet consume great quantity red meat , others eat substantial amount process meat product eat mostly white meat fish complicate interpretation outcome . In cross-sectional observational cohort study compare long-term vegetarian long-term omnivore , result may influence lifestyle choice besides studied diet , smoke exercise.Furthermore , participant many previous study often healthy volunteer patient overt cardiovascular disease . Purpose The objective perform open label , 6 week randomize , cross-over study compare effect vegetarian diet conventional ( meat contain ) diet base Swedish average meat consumption range parameter prognostic importance cardiovascular disease : lipid , inflammation , oxidative stress , BMI , HbA1c , apolipoprotein B/apolipoprotein A1-ratio , gut microbiota , endothelial function quality life . The study conduct patient diagnose STEMI ( ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction ) , non-STEMI ( non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction ) angina pectoris treat percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) . Hypothesis The study hypothesis patient diagnose IHD benefit vegetarian diet assess multiple risk marker type disease primary focus change oxidize LDL cholesterol . Clinical relevance During last decade global mortality IHD remain unchanged regardless development new invasive pharmacological treatment . Despite fact prevalence mortality IHD decrease country since 1990 decrease likely due lifestyle change , IHD remain leading cause death Sweden .</detailed_description>
