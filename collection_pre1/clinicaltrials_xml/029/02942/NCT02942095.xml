	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study find high tolerable dose combination ixazomib erlotinib give patient advance solid tumor . The safety drug also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Ixazomib Erlotinib Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If participant find eligible take part study , participant assign dose level ixazomib erlotinib base participant join study . Up 4 dose level ixazomib test . Up 18 participant may enrol dose level . The first group participant receive low dose level . Each new group receive high dose group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose ixazomib find . All participant receive dose erlotinib . Once high tolerable dose find , 18 participant enrol dose level expansion group . The dose study drug combination participant receive may lower participant intolerable side effect . Study Drug Administration : Each study cycle 28 day . Participant take ixazomib capsule mouth Days 1 , 8 , 15 cycle . Participant take erlotinib tablet mouth Days 1-28 cycle . Participant swallow ixazomib capsule whole 8 ounce ( 1 cup ) water . Each capsule swallow separately sip water . Participant also swallow erlotinib tablet whole water . Participant take ixazomib erlotinib dose time . Participant break , chew , open capsule tablet . Each dose take empty stomach , least 1 hour 2 hour meal . If participant miss dose , participant take soon participant remembers , long next schedule dose least 72 hour ( ixazomib ) 12 hour ( erlotinib ) away . Participant take double dose make miss dose . If participant vomit take dose , participant wait next schedule dose . Participant take additional dose . Participant 's dose study drug may change and/or participant may give drug help control side effect . Study Visits : Cycle 1 : Week 1 : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 6 teaspoon ) draw routine test check participant 's liver kidney function . - If participant become pregnant , leftover blood ( 1 teaspoon ) and/or urine collect pregnancy test . - During Days 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , blood ( 1-3 teaspoon ) draw pharmacokinetic ( PK ) test . PK test measure amount study drug body different time point . Week 2 : Â°Blood ( 6 teaspoon ) draw routine test check participant 's liver kidney function . Week 3 : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 6 teaspoon ) draw routine test check participant 's liver kidney function . Cycle 2 Beyond : Week 1 : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 6 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . The blood sample also use liver kidney function test . - If participant become pregnant , part routine blood urine test use pregnancy test . To continue study , participant must pregnant . Week 4 : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 6 teaspoon ) draw routine test check participant 's liver kidney function . - On Day 28 cycle , doctor think need , participant EKG . - At end every cycle ( Cycles 2 , 4 , 6 , ) , participant imaging scan ( either CT scan MRI ) perform check status disease . If participant side effect abnormal test result study , participant may ask return clinic test side effect abnormal test result improve . Length Study : Participant may continue take study drug long doctor think participant 's best interest . Participant longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , participant develop new health problem , participant longer able follow study direction . Participation study end-of-study visit . End Study Visit : Within 30 day participant 's last dose study drug , follow test procedure perform : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 6 teaspoon ) draw routine test check participant 's liver kidney function . - Urine collect routine test . This investigational study . Erlotinib FDA approve commercially available treat non-small cell lung cancer , use advance solid cancer consider investigational . Ixazomib FDA approve . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 36 participant take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

Measurable disease define RECIST criterion ( Version 1.1 ) . 8 . Patients Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status ( ECOG PS ) 0 1 . 9 . Having archival paraffin tissue ideal correlative study mandatory . 10 . Voluntary write consent must give performance study relate procedure part standard medical care , understand consent may withdraw patient time without prejudice future medical care . 11 . Female patient : Are postmenopausal least 1 year screen visit , OR Are surgically sterile , OR If childbearing potential , agree practice 2 effective method contraception , time , time signing informed consent form 90 day last dose study drug , OR Agree practice true abstinence line prefer usual lifestyle subject .

Inclusion Criteria dose expansion cohort : Nonsmall cell lung cancer : 1 ) We enroll nonsmall cell lung cancer patient document EGFR mutation fail treatment antiEGFR therapy ( e.g . erlotinib afatinib ) test negative EGFR T790M mutation . We allow patient positive EGFR T790M mutation progress third generation antiEGFR therapy ( e.g . CO1686 AZD9291 ) medically suitable/candidate third generation antiEGFR therapy .
