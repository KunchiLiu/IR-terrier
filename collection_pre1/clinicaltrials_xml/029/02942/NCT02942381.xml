	<brief_title>A Study Hydroxychloroquine Sulfate Reduction Proteinuria Patients With IgA Nephropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Immunoglobulin A ( IgA ) nephropathy common type primary glomerulonephritis worldwide . Several study indicate 6-43 % IgA nephropathy patient would develop end-stage kidney disease ( ESKD ) period 10 year . The clinical risk factor progression hypertension , proteinuria , impaired renal function histologic lesion presentation . There well accept optimal therapy patient IgA . Current establish therapy include full RAS inhibition optimal blood pressure control patient proteinuria and/or hypertension . Hydroxychloroquine use many year treat malaria . It also use treat systemic lupus erythematosus , rheumatic disorder like rheumatoid arthritis Sj√∂gren 's Syndrome . Recently , several study find Hydroxychloroquine could reduce risk ESRD patient lupus nephritis . The mechanism treatment n't well know far . Some investigator find Hydroxychloroquine increase lysosomal pH antigen present cell . In inflammatory condition , block toll-like receptor plasmacytoid dendritic cell ( PDCs ) . Toll-like receptor 9 ( TLR 9 ) , recognize DNA-containing immune complex , lead production interferon cause dendritic cell mature present antigen T cell . Hydroxychloroquine , decrease TLR signaling , reduce activation dendritic cell inflammatory process . The pathogenesis IgA nephropathy include deposition immune complex contain IgA mesangium cause local immune activation injury kidney . Therefore , Hydroxychloroquine might potential effect anti-inflammation patient IgA nephropathy , reduce proteinuria renal protect effect . The investigator study recruit IgA nephropathy patient proteinuria range 0.75 3.5g/d even three-month treatment sufficient ACEi/ARB . The patient treat Hydroxychloroquine 200-400mg/d accord eGFR . The proteinuria record every two month total four month . Then , drug stop two month observation change proteinuria .</detailed_description>
