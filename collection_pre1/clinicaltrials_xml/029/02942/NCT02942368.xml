	<brief_summary>This pilot study aim investigate potential role transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) treatment treatment-resistant major depressive disorder ( MDD ) . tDCS noninvasive brain stimulation technique utilize treatment major depression several study , primary adjunctive treatment . The treatment administer supervision physician experience administer treatment monitoring complication . This prospective `` adaptive tDCS stimulation '' open label research study . Participants receive 20 minute session 4 milliamps ( mA ) transcutaneous electrical stimulation session 4 6 week . Building theory great current `` dose '' may significant factor determine efficacy , study aim determine whether high tDCS current dos lead great improvement depressive symptom population patient treatment-resistant major depressive disorder .</brief_summary>
