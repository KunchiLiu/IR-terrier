	<brief_summary>Background : TG02 investigational drug penetrate blood-brain barrier might treat brain tumor . Temozolomide ( TMZ ) drug use treat brain tumor . Objective : To find TG02 safe , find combination TMZ effective TMZ alone people brain tumor . Eligibility : People age 18 old brain tumor progress standard treatment Design : Participants screen : Medical history Physical exam Blood urine test MRI brain one 14 day Heart test Tissue sample prior surgery Participants take TG02 plus TMZ mouth 28-day cycle . Some take TMZ 7 day 7 day . Others take every day . They take TG02 three day Cycle 1 , four day every cycle . They get treatment prevent vomit diarrhea 24 hour TG02 dose . They keep diary take drug symptom . Participants study visit . These include : Physical exam , heart test , quality life questionnaire , brain MRI , urine test every 4 week Blood test every 2 week Participants continue treatment disease get bad intolerable side effect . Participants also enrol another protocol test molecular marker brain tumor ... .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TG02 Plus Dose-Dense Metronomic Temozolomide Followed Randomized Phase II Trial TG02 Plus Temozolomide Versus Temozolomide Alone Adults With Recurrent Anaplastic Astrocytoma Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - TG02 pyrimidine-based multi-kinase inhibitor show inhibitory effect CDKs , Janus Kinase 2 ( JAK2 ) Fm-like tyrosine kinase 3 ( Flt3 ) . It orally administer penetrates blood brain barrier ( BBB ) . There clinical experience use TG02 single agent combination chemotherapy agent cancer treatment . - Temozolomide ( TMZ ) oral alkylating agent proven efficacy anaplastic glioma glioblastoma . It approve U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treat anaplastic astrocytoma glioblastoma adult . Both dose-dense ( dd ) schedule , 7 day 7 day metronomic ( mn ) daily dose schedule use treat recurrent high-grade glioma . - Our preclinical data demonstrate TG02 down-regulates CDK9 target protein , anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 , XIAP survivin . A treatment TG02 TMZ strong combinational anti-glioma effect variety glioma model different genetic background . This serve basis propose clinical trial . Objectives : Phase I : -To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) TG02 plus TMZ use dd mn TMZ schedule adult patient recurrent anaplastic astrocytoma glioblastoma/gliosarcoma . Phase II : -To determine efficacy TG02 plus TMZ versus TMZ alone patient recurrent WHO grade III IV astrocytoma determine progression free survival . Eligibility : - Documented pathology diagnosis anaplastic glioma [ WHO grade III ] intact 1p/19q chromosome , glioblastoma/gliosarcoma [ WHO grade IV ] recurrent disease . - No prior use bevacizumab . - No two prior relapse Phase I one prior relapse Phase II . - Tumor tissue available review confirm histologic diagnosis . - Tumor tissue block available molecular profiling analysis . Design : Phase I : - This portion study conduct two stage : The MTD find cohort extension . Two treatment arm several dose level plan . - In MTD find part , TMZ two alternate schedule ( dd mn ) combination TG02 administer . - A cohort extension arm perform MTD treatment arm good progression free survival 4 month ( PFS4 ) select combination treatment arm Phase II . - A maximum 72 patient enrol component trial . Phase II : - Patients randomize two compete treatment arm : ( `` winner '' dd v mn ) TMZ + TG02 versus dd/mn TMZ alone use Bayesian clinical trial design . The dosage combination arm derive MTD determine Phase I component study . - The treatment schedule identical describe phase I component , cycle comprise 28 day . - Patients continue treatment tumor progression unacceptable toxicity occur . - At progression , patient randomize control arm ( TMZ alone ) offer opportunity continue TMZ additional treatment TG02 .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Inclusion criterion Phase I Phase II part , except number prior disease relapse Patients must pathologic diagnosis anaplastic astrocytoma define WHO grade III intact 1p/19q chromosome , glioblastoma/gliosarcoma , WHO grade IV , confirm NCI Laboratory Pathology . Patients must histologically prove image proven recurrent anaplastic astrocytoma , glioblastoma gliosarcoma . Prior implantation Gliadel wafer acceptable , tumor recurrence confirm histologic examination recurrent tumor Patients must ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Patients must great equal 18 year old . No two prior disease relapse eligible phase I portion study one prior relapse eligible phase II . Patients must undergo prior standard therapy primary disease . For patient glioblastoma , would include surgical resection , radiation adjuvant temozolomide . For patient anaplastic astrocytoma , would include surgical resection , radiation adjuvant chemotherapy PCV temozolomide . Tumor tissue must available review confirm histological diagnosis . Tumor block 15 unstained slide must available molecular profiling . Karnofsky great equal 60 Patients must adequate bone marrow function ( ANC great equal 1,500/mm^3 , platelet count great equal 100,000/mm^3 , adequate liver function SGPT le equal 3 time upper limit normal alkaline phosphatase less equal 2 time upper limit normal , total bilirubin less equal 1.5mg/dl ) , adequate renal function ( BUN le equal 1.5 time institutional normal serum creatinine le 1.5 mg/dl prior registration . These test must perform within 14 day prior registration . Patients must recover toxic effect prior therapy less grade 2 toxicity per CTC version 4 except deep vein thrombosis . At time registration , subject must remove prior therapy follow : great equal ( 28 day ) investigational agent , great equal 4 week ( 28 day ) prior cytotoxic therapy , great equal 2 week ( 14 day ) vincristine , great equal 6 week ( 42 day ) nitrosoureas , great equal 3 week ( 21 day ) procarbazine administration , great equal 1 week ( 7 day ) noncytotoxic agent , e.g. , interferon , tamoxifen , thalidomide , cisretinoic acid , etc . radiosensitizer count . Patients undergone recent resection recurrent progressive tumor eligible long follow condition apply : At least 2 week ( 14 day ) elapse date surgery patient recover effect surgery . Evaluable measureable disease follow resection recurrent Malignant Glioma mandate eligibility study . To best assess extent residual disease postoperatively , MRI do later 96 hour immediate postoperative period least within 4 week postoperatively , within 14 day prior registration . If 96hour scan 14 day registration , scan need repeat . If steroid dose increase date imaging registration , new baseline MRI require stable steroid dosage least 5 day . Patients must receive prior radiation therapy must interval great equal 12 week ( 84 day ) completion radiation therapy study entry except unequivocal evidence tumor recurrence ( histological confirmation advance image data PET scan ) case least 4 week ( 28 day ) completion radiation therapy suffice . Women childbearing potential must negative betaHCG pregnancy test document within 14 day prior registration . The effect TG02 develop human fetus unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential must pregnant , must breastfeed , must practice adequate contraception duration study , 30 day last dose study medication .

Patients must agree enroll NOB Natural History protocol allow assessment molecular tumor marker . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients receive investigational agent . However , prior enrollment study use investigational agent acceptable per section Patients prior bevacizumab exposure . ( To date , effective regimen develop recurrent malignant glioma refractory bevacizumab . Inclusion patient population may impact ability determine efficacy TG02 TMZ . ) Any serious medical condition , laboratory abnormality , psychiatric illness would prevent subject provide informed consent . Any condition , include presence clinically significant laboratory abnormality , place patient unacceptable risk he/she participate study confounds ability interpret data study . These would include : Active infection ( include persistent fever ) include know AIDS Hepatitis C infection , patient increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Diseases condition obscure toxicity dangerously alter drug metabolism Serious concurrent medical illness e.g . symptomatic congestive heart failure History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition temozolomide and/or TG02 . Patients history cancer ( except nonmelanoma skin cancer carcinoma insitu cervix bladder ) , unless complete remission therapy disease minimum 3 year ineligible .
