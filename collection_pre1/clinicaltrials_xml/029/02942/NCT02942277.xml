	<brief_summary>Background : Researchers look new way control eradicate malaria . They want test vaccine block malaria transmission adult Mali . These vaccine work induce antibody person . The antibody take blood mosquito bite person . This block parasite development mosquito . This stop malaria transmission another person . Objective : To test safety , reactogenicity , immunogenicity , transmission-blocking activity vaccine Pfs25M-EPA Pfs230D1M-EPA AS01 Malian adult . Eligibility : Healthy Malians age 18 50 living certain area Mali : Are pregnant breastfeeding Are infect HIV , Hepatitis B Hepatitis C Do evidence immunodeficiency Do history severe allergic reaction anaphylaxis Design : Participants screen : Medical history Physical exam Malaria Comprehension Exam Blood urine test Electrocardiogram ( participant certain study group ) Participants randomly assign study group . Participants monitor 12 16 month . For first 7 month , 1 nine visit month . The number depend month group . For rest month , 1 monthly visit . Each visit include physical exam . Most include blood test . Participants get 3 dos study comparator vaccine . They get vaccine injection upper arm . This occur first visit , 1 month later , 5 month later . Participants follow least 6 month last vaccine . If participant develop injection site rash reaction , photograph may take site .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A vaccine interrupt malaria transmission ( VIMT ) would valuable tool local elimination eradication disease , may contain component block transmission mosquito ( Pfs25 Pfs230 ) prevent human infection ( vaccine RTS , S ) . Pfs25 Pfs230 , surface antigen zygotes ookinetes ( gametocyte Pfs230 ) mosquito stage P. falciparum , lead candidate malaria transmission block vaccine ( TBV ) . Recombinant Pfs25M recombinant Pfs230D1M conjugate P. aeruginosa ExoProtein A ( EPA ) adjuvanted AS01 . Our ongoing experience Pfs25M-EPA Pfs230D1M-EPA Malian adult trial participant , extensive experience AS01 adjuvant African child adult , justify conduct first-in-human trial Pfs25M-EPA Pfs230D1M-EPA AS01 Malian adult . This dose-escalating phase 1 study determine safety , immunogenicity , functional activity vaccine Malian adult . Pfs25M-EPA + Pfs230D1M-EPA AS01 assess mosquito feeding assay Malian adult evidence may reduce number malaria transmission event study subject . A total 305 subject enrol multiple site Mali , West Africa receive escalate dos malaria transmission block vaccine ( ) : Pfs25M-EPA/AS01 , Pfs230D1M-EPA/AS01 , simultaneous administration Pfs25M-EPA/AS01 Pfs230D1M-EPA/AS01 ; comparator vaccine ( ENERGIX-B ) . Enrollment within group stagger additional safety subject enrol co-administration group individual dose administer . Subjects follow least 6 month last vaccination . Safety outcomes local systemic adverse event serious adverse event . Immunogenicity outcomes antibody response measure ELISA recombinant Pfs25 , Pfs230 , EPA , CSP , B cell T cell response . Functional activity induce antibody assess TBV arm standard membrane feeding assay conduct National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases , activity interrupt malaria transmission measure arm direct skin feeding assay Mali .</detailed_description>
