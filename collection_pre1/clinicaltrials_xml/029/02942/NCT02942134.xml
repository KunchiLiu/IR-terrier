	<brief_summary>Acute dyspnea use non-invasive ventilation ( NIV ) common phenomenon patient COPD emphysema . This trial aim document incidence severity augment dyspnea patient long term NIV therapy . These finding may help understand pathomechanisms lead post-NIV dyspnea thus give way potential therapy scheme .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Acute Dyspnea After Use Non-invasive Ventilation COPD Emphysema ( Deventilation Syndrome )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non-invasive ventilation ( NIV ) widespread therapy option patient hypercapnic failure due COPD emphysema . Augmented dyspnea use NIV commonly find lead high patient discomfort , also associate acute respiratory failure . This monocentric obervation trial include patient COPD III°-IV° ( GOLD ) emphysema establish long term NIV therapy . During routine inpatient follow-up , extend routine examination , focus vulnerable first hour nocturnal use NIV . This include monitoring breath rate , heart rate , pulsoxymetry , trancutaneous CO2 , blood pressure capillary blood gas analysis . Sonographic measurement diaphragm movement thickness complement . Subjective dyspnea document use BORG scale . By collect data , hope understand pathomechanisms cause augment dyspnea NIV thus provide information therapeutical concept prevent .</detailed_description>
