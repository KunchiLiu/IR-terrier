	<detailed_description>Crohn 's disease ( CD ) chronic , transmural inflammatory disorder affect whole alimentary tract mouth anus . Over past decade , incidence CD either high stable low rise worldwide . Although precise etiopathogenesis CD remain unknown , number line evidence show inappropriate diet one reason responsible onset CD , diet therapy gain increase attention therapeutic work-up CD . Due reduce intake high intestinal loss , three quarter CD patient would suffer weight loss . Involvement small bowel CD patient make nutrition status much poor ulcerative colitis ( UC ) patient . Therefore , nutrition support great value management CD . It widely accept enteral nutrition could help pediatric CD patient reach clinical endoscopic remission , similar efficacy less side effect corticosteroid . However , value enteral nutrition adult active CD still controversial , unstable remission rate range 8 % 100 % . Varied characteristic compliance enrol patient might explain wide range . Considering , idetification factor favor use enteral nutrition would helpful select preferred patient suitable enteral nutrition . In study , observe role enteral nutrition active adult CD . The age , gender , serum CRP , albumin , fecal calprotectin , nutritional risk screening 2002 ( NRS2002 ) , involve intestinal segment item correlate change Crohn 's disease activity index ( Best CDAI ) CRP order idetify factor favor use enteral nutrition .</detailed_description>
