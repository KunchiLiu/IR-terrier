	<brief_summary>The purpose study understand pathophysiological mechanism ADHD , especially metabolomic pathway related behavioral/neuropsychological deficit ADHD . To identify specific metabolite show significant difference ADHD control group , liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry gas chromatography-mass spectrometry perform . In addition , behavioral measure include ADHDRS-IV , SNAP-IV , CBCL , CGI-ADHD-S , SAICA , Family APGAR-C. Neuropsychological testing , include CPT CANTAB , perform . Conditional logistic regression partial least square discriminant analysis apply identify significant metabolite ADHD . Pathway enrichment topology analysis conduct evaluate regulate pathway .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Because attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) early onset long-term impair disorder tremendous impact individual , family , society , detection diagnosis important ADHD . Current diagnosis ADHD rely mainly clinical observation interview tool may involve great subjective variability , thus investigation objective biomarkers ADHD warrant . Metabolomics study biologic process involve metabolite end product cellular process whole organism . Because metabolite represent downstream expression genome , transcriptome , proteome , metabolomic profile proximal behavioral phenotype ADHD . Analyzing metabolic difference child ADHD healthy control provide insight underlying disease pathology . To date , metabolomics study ADHD . In 3-year project , investigator perform metabolomics analysis serum identify potential biomarkers behavioral neuropsychological deficit ADHD . This 3-year project . After careful calculation sample size , investigator recruit 35 drug-na√Øve child ADHD , age 7-18 , 35 healthy control match age , sex BMI . Using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry gas chromatography-mass spectrometry , serum-based metabolomic profiling perform . The behavioral measure include ADHDRS-IV , SNAP-IV , CBCL , CGI-ADHD-S , SAICA , Family APGAR-C. Neuropsychological testing , include CPT CANTAB , perform . Conditional logistic regression partial least square discriminant analysis apply identify significant metabolite ADHD . Pathway enrichment topology analysis conduct evaluate regulate pathway . Using matched study design , investigator anticipate identify specific metabolite show significant difference ADHD control group . In addition , result pathway analysis may offer biological understand explain underlie metabolic regulation among child ADHD . This find significantly contribute knowledge pathophysiological mechanism ADHD , especially metabolomic pathway related behavioral/neuropsychological deficit ADHD .</detailed_description>
