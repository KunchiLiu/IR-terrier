	<brief_summary>This open-label , pilot study design evaluate safety feasibility combine anastrozole palbociclib follow two cohort : Cohort A ) first-line therapy Cohort B ) maintenance therapy first-line chemotherapy postmenopausal patient HR-positive , HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer . Pre- perimenopausal woman must receive therapy LHRH agonist . The LHRH agonist choice approve LHRH agonist administer accord respective prescribing information . Following informed consent eligibility check , subject enrol either Cohort A Cohort B .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A total 40 subject enrolled enrollment period 18-24 month . The study plan enroll 25 patient Cohort A ( upfront ) 15 patient Cohort B ( maintenance ) . Subjects recruit Levine Cancer Institute location referral . Women race ethnic origin meet study criterion may participate clinical trial . Males eligible study . Breast cancer men rare efficacy aromatase inhibitor male limit . Children include clinical trial effect palbociclib know pediatric population , may eligible pediatric trial .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Are 18 year age old , either : Postmenopausal , define least one follow criterion : Age great equal 60 year ; Age le 60 year cessation regular menses least 12 consecutive month alternative pathological physiological cause serum estradiol , FSH LH level within laboratory reference range postmenopausal female ; Documented bilateral oophorectomy ; Medically confirm ovarian failure OR premenopausal perimenopausal , i.e. , meet criterion postmenopausal . Premenopausal perimenopausal woman enrol amenable treated LHRH agonist . Patients must commence treatment LHRH agonist least 4 week prior start study treatment . Histologically cytological confirm diagnosis breast cancer evidence metastatic disease . Locally advanced disease amenable resection eligible . Documentation ERpositive , PRpositive tumor base recent tumor biopsy ( unless boneonly disease ) . ER PR assay consider positive least 1 percent positive tumor sample . Documentation HER2negative tumor base recent tumor biopsy . Tumor must demonstrate overexpression HER2 either IHC ( immunohistochemistry ) insitu hybridization ( ISH ) . No previous treatment metastatic disease Cohort A . For Cohort A : previous treatment endocrine therapy adjuvant neoadjuvant setting allow For Cohort B : firstline chemotherapy ( singleagent combination regimen ) metastatic disease response ( defined complete response partial response RECIST version 1.1 , stable disease six month regimen ) chemotherapy discontinue 21 day allow ; patient may receive prior systemic therapy adjuvant neoadjuvant setting . For Cohort A , measurable disease define RECIST version 1.1 , boneonly disease prior start study treatment . Patients boneonly metastatic cancer must lytic mixed lyticblastic lesion accurately assess CT MRI . Patients boneonly disease blasticonly metastasis eligible . Tumor lesion previously irradiate subject loco regional therapy deem measurable progression treat site completion therapy clearly document . For Cohort B , measurable disease define RECIST version 1.1 , evaluable disease . Patient archival tumor tissue available formalinfixed paraffinembedded . Biopsy sample take time presentation recurrent metastatic disease recommended.For patient archival tissue , tissue fresh biopsy obtain prior study treatment initiation , safely attain use local anesthesia . One exception patient boneonly disease provision previous archival tissue would acceptable . Serial fresh tumor tissue sample collect patient lesion amenable biopsy consent procedure . ECOG performance status 0 , 1 2 . Must normal organ marrow function define : Hematologic : Absolute neutrophil count great equal 1,500/mcL ; Platelets great equal 100,000/mcL ; Hemoglobin great equal 9 g/dL . Renal : Serum creatinine less equal 1.5X ULN Measured calculate creatinine clearance ( CrCl ) great equal 60 mL/min subject creatinine level &gt; 1.5X ULN [ CrCl calculate per institutional standard ; GFR also use place creatinine CrCl ] Hepatic : Total bilirubin less equal 1.5X ULN ; AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) less equal 3X ULN ( less equal 5X ULN liver metastasis present ) ; Alkaline phosphatase less equal 2.5X ULN ( less equal 5X ULN liver bone metastasis present ) Able swallow retain oral medication per Investigator . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Prior treatment CDK inhibitor Known active uncontrolled symptomatic central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases , carcinomatous meningitis , leptomeningeal disease indicate clinical symptom , cerebral edema , and/or progressive growth . Patients treat brain metastasis eligible evidence progression least 4 week CNSdirected treatment , ascertain clinical examination brain imaging ( MRI CT ) screen period . Use food drug know potent CYP3A4 inhibitor drug know potent CYP3A4 inducer ( example , see Prohibited Medications Section ) Major surgery , chemotherapy , radiotherapy , anticancer therapy within 3 week treatment . Any follow within 6 month prior study consent : myocardial infarction , severe/unstable angina , ongoing cardiac dysrhythmias NCI CTCAE Grade 2 , atrial fibrillation grade , coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft , symptomatic congestive heart failure , cerebrovascular accident include transient ischemic attack , symptomatic pulmonary embolism . Impairment gastrointestinal function GI disease may significantly alter absorption palbociclib , history GI surgery may result intestinal blind loops patient clinically significant gastroparesis , short bowel syndrome , unresolved nausea , vomit , active inflammatory bowel disease diarrhea CTCAE Grade &gt; 1 . Prior hematopoietic stem cell bone marrow transplantation . Known hypersensitivity anastrozole . Known human immunodeficiency virus infection . Other severe acute chronic medical psychiatric condition , may increase risk associate study participation investigational product administration may interfere interpretation study result , judgment Investigator , would make patient inappropriate entry study . Participation study involve investigational drug ( ) within 4 week treatment initiation study .</criteria>
