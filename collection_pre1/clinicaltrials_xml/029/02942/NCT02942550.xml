	<brief_summary>This study examine impact peripheral opioid antagonist methylnaltrexone onset effect ticagrelor morphine treat patient ST elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) . Half participant receive methylnaltrexone , half receive placebo .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Methylnaltrexone Method Improve Ticagrelor Uptake Morphine Treated STEMI Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The rate drug absorption gastro-intestinal tract often determine rate gastric emptying . Morphine treatment , frequently give order relieve pain patient STEMI , know delay gastric empty , indeed emerge predictor delayed/poor antiplatelet response patient receive oral prasugrel ticagrelor . In recent year , morphine find delay onset oral P2Y12-inhibitors . To counteract , investigator hypothesize opioid antagonist may use . The opioid antagonist naloxone previously show reduce morphine induce delay gastric empty However , naloxone cross blood-brain barrier ( BBB ) reduce pain relieve effect morphine . In contrast , morphine antagonist methylnaltrexone reduce passage BBB act primarily peripheral morphine antagonist without affect morphine-mediated central analgesic effect . The aim plan study evaluate whether methylnaltrexone bromide may reduce morphine induce delay onset platelet inhibition load dose 180 mg ticagrelor morphine treat patient STEMI undergo primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) , rapid adequate platelet inhibition administration ticagrelor crucial . As morphine inclusion criterion , patient include study morphine treatment . Thus , morphine treatment intervention administer part protocol . Stratification accord inferior anterior/lateral STEMI perform avoid imbalance location myocardial infarction group .</detailed_description>
