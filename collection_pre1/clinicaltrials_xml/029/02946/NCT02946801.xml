	<brief_summary>The accumulation maturation oral biofilm gingival margin widely recognise primary aetiological factor development chronic gingivitis . Based association , current treatment gingivitis focus biofilm disruption , normally include mechanical process , professionally home . However , patient , easy achieve proper level plaque control . The efficient plaque control technique time consume require special motivation skill optimum use . It point mouthwashes become important , due fact include diverse type antimicrobial agent complement result mechanical oral hygiene measure . The essential oil present realiable alternative `` gold Standard '' ( Chlorhexidine ) . However , use limit clinically due alcohol contain . Some year ago , new alternative without alcohol launch market . This formulation already deeply test specific antiplaque study structure biofilm remain intact . The aim study evaluate situ antiplaque effect 2 antimicrobial agent ( base essential oil formulation without alcohol ) short term posterior analysis `` non-destructured '' biofilm Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope combine fluorescence staining .</brief_summary>
