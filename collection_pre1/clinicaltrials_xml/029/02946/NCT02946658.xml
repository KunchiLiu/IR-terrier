	<brief_summary>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) lung-related disorder characterize long-term , often progressive state poor airflow . Primary symptom include low oxygen tension , shortness breath , productive cough , broncho-pulmonary inflammation interference oxygen-carbon dioxide exchange . Air pollution tobacco smoking felt common cause issue . Diagnostic test base poor airflow measure lung function study whose symptom improve much antiasthma bronchodilator . Study interventional study document safety efficacy use AD-cSVF chronic broncho-pulmonary disease group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>COPD often treat limiting exposure poor air quality , cure time . Attempted therapy include smoke cessation , vaccination , respiratory rehabilitation , attempt use bronchodilator steroid . Many resort supplemental oxygen therapy , lung transplantation , antibiotic supportive therapy exacerbation . As 2013 , COPD involve approximately 5 % pf global population ( approximately 330 million ) . Most commonly occur approximately equally men/women result 3 million death per year . Estimates economic cost estimate 2.1 trillion dollar 2010 . This study include microcannula harvest subdermal adipose tissue , incubation , digestion isolation AD-cSVF . This stromal cellular pellet ( without actual extracellular matrix stromal element ) suspend 500 cc sterile Normal Saline ( NS ) deploy via peripheral intravenous route . Evaluations safety issue measure interval ( severe non-severe category ) repeat pulmonary function study .</detailed_description>
