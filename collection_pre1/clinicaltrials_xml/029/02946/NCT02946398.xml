	<brief_title>Risk Stratification Emergency Department Acutely Ill Older Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Elderly patient ( ≥65 year age ) constitute increase population emergency department ( EDs ) many country . These patient largely different young patient undoubtedly need different approach acute care . Commonly used triage system validate elderly patient . We hypothesize factor contributes lack recognition patient risk adverse event death . Aim study : - At first , try identify risk factor associate adverse outcome age , premorbid state ( comorbidity , live status cognitive/functional state ) , medication use , vital sign , number previous visit ED . - Secondly , investigate discriminate power several triage risk stratification score . In study , retrieve validate follow triage risk stratification score : The Manchester Triage System ( MTS ) triage score , Acute Physiology Chronic Health Evaluation II ( APACHE II ) score Identification Seniors At Risk-Hospitalised Patients ( ISAR-HP ) score hospitalized patient . Furthermore , calculate four well-known disease specific stratification score : The Glasgow-Blatchford Bleeding ( GBS Score ) patient upper gastrointestinal bleeding , Abbreviated Mortality ED Sepsis ( abbMEDS ) score Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment ( SOFA ) score Confusion , Urea , Respiration , Blood pressure , Age &gt; 65 year ( CURB-65 ) score . - Thirdly , investigate predictive value clinical impression professional ( doctor/nurse ) disease perception patient/companion . - And last , investigate predictive value laboratory test ( routine test biomarkers like lactate , N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide ( NT-pro-BNP ) , high-sensitivity troponin ( hs-TnT ) , procalcitonin ( PCT ) d-dimer . Study procedure : The design multi-center prospective observational cohort study . The study take place Zuyderland MC Heerlen Maastricht UMC+ Netherlands . On presentation ED patient give information study inform consent sign . The patient family member/companion , nurse doctor ask fill questionnaire ED . These question use evaluation clinical impression doctor/nurse disease perception patient/companion . At ED , 2 extra venous sample one arterial blood gas sample take patient participate study Zuyderland M.C . Blood gas analysis take place immediately result present attend doctor . Analysis biomarkers venous blood sample take place week result blind study . Routine laboratory test analyze hospital . During day week inclusion , data obtain patient medical record . During day week inclusion , data obtain patient medical record . All patient follow 30 day possible one year .</detailed_description>
