	<brief_summary>This research achieve assessment p75NTR-ECD expression ( total link different specie Aβ ( Aβ1-40 Aβ-1-42 ) ) within cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) patient AD dementia , mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) due AD , frontotemporal dementia non-neurodegenerative dementia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>P75NTR , Diagnostic Biomarker Alzheimer 's Disease : Quantification Study Cerebrospinal Fluid</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) dementia clinically characterize cognitive impairment early memory loss neuropathologically two main lesion , amyloid deposit tau protein accumulation . Presently , early diagnosis AD rely clinical symptom , image technique recently introduce radio-tracers analysis cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers . All tools efficient patient already symptomatic presently know lesion might reversible appear early time life patient , several decade onset clinical sign . To find biomarker would detect early test peripheral fluid challenge . According updated physiopathology disease refer previous work sphingolipid pathway AD , precedent study focus attention original protein , p75NTR particularly extracellular domain ( ECD ) . This protein involve physiopathology AD several way ( apoptosis , survival ) . P75NTR-ECD interacts Aβ , increase solubility accelerate clearance . The hypothesis present study p75NTR-ECD could express differentially accord category stage dementia . More precisely , new biomarker could help diagnosis AD could also use early marker AD test peripheral fluid .</detailed_description>
