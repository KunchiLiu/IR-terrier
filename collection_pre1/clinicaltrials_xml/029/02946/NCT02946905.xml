	<brief_summary>Cognitive impairment poorly understood , serious , emerge complication adult patient sickle cell disease . Because extensive microvascular damage oxidative damage sickle cell disease , investigator hypothesize also present cerebral microvasculature cause cognitive impairment . The investigator plan test correlate marker inflammation oxidative damage cognitive performance 7 Tesla brain MRI microvascular finding patient , long term goal understand mechanism risk factor cognitive impairment sickle cell disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neurovascular Determinants Cognitive Function Adults With Sickle Cell Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Neurovascular Determinants Cognitive Function Adults Sickle Cell Disease study adult 18 old diagnose Sickle Cell Disease ( SCD ) . Many adult patient SCD suffer cognitive impairment ( CI ) , serious complication responsible severe functional limitation , whose pathogenesis , risk factor , natural history unknown . This research project look cognitive performance 7 Tesla brain MRI finding along marker inflammation oxidation well understand mechanism risk factor . The investigator complete baseline assessment . SCD participant see follow-up 3 5 year . Non-SCD participant see follow-up 3 year . All assessment complete cost compensation participation .</detailed_description>
