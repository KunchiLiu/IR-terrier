	<brief_title>Comparison VoLumen Breeza Oral Contrast Agents Pediatric Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>VoLumen , low Hounsfield unit 0.1 % barium sulfate suspension also contain sorbitol gum , common oral contrast material use child adult undergo CT MR enterography ( advanced imaging test use evaluate bowel lumen bowel wall child adult , usually suspect know Crohn disease ) . This contrast material typically administer orally non-sedated patient 45-60 minute period prior image . The goal oral contrast material administration completely fill small bowel fluid time image . Benefits oral contrast material cross-sectional enterography include : improved delineation bowel non-bowel structure abdomen pelvis , improved accuracy assess bowel wall thickness , improve visualization mucosal hyper-enhancement set active intestinal inflammation . In child ( adult ) , standard-of-care contrast agent ( VoLumen ) poorly tolerate . This likely due variety factor , include taste , texture , volume require consume . Recently , new oral contrast material call `` Breeza neutral abdominopelvic imaging '' ( simply Breeza ) become available use CT MR enterography . This agent contain sorbitol , mannitol , xantham gum ( thicken agent ) , market `` flavored beverage '' contains active ingredient ( e.g. , barium sulfate ) . A single study perform adult volunteer show new agent performs similar VoLumen , superior taste , associate great willingness repeat drinking . The objective study compare standard-of-care oral contrast material newly available contrast material prospective , randomize , blind manner . Primary outcome include degree small bowel opacification , distention terminal ileum , patient acceptance/tolerability .</detailed_description>
