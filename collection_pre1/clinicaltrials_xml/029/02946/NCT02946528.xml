	<brief_title>Urgent-start Peritoneal Dialysis ESRD Patientsï¼šSafety Efficacy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prevalence chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) rise worldwide . Moreover , many patient progress ESRD , even regular nephrology follow-up , distinct plan time initiate dialysis therapy , result urgent need dialysis . Urgent-start dialysis refers urgent initiation dialysis ESRD patient pre-established functional vascular access peritoneal dialysis ( PD ) catheter . Hemodialysis ( HD ) prefer center high rate central venous catheter ( CVC ) use time initiate dialysis among HD patient . There significantly increase risk infectious complication , thrombosis , complication associate CVC use negatively affect patient prognosis . Within last decade , urgent-start PD gain considerable interest amongst nephrologists . Several publication provide assurance urgent-start PD indeed feasible serve patient well ; however , study small sample size , impact urgent-start dialysis modality outcome , especially short-term complication , directly evaluate . Therefore , conduct multicenter , prospective , randomized clinical trial compare dialysis-related complication survival rate directly urgent-start PD HD group large sample determine feasibility safety urgent-start PD alternate initial modality dialysis patient require urgent initiation dialysis therapy .</detailed_description>
