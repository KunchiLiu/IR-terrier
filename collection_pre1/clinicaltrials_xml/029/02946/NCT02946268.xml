	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine ideal delivery local anesthetic pain control use continuous interscalene peripheral nerve catheter shoulder surgery . The study conduct three stage . In first stage ideal bolus volume ropivacaine determine . In second stage optimal rate delivery bolus ( infusion rate ) determine . Finally , ideal volume infusion rate determine , optimal interval boluses local anesthetic determine .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose study determine ideal delivery local anesthetic postoperative analgesia use continuous interscalene peripheral nerve catheter shoulder surgery . New technology emerge electronic pump permit intermittent mandatory bolus local anesthetic deliver addition continuous infusion . The pump would automatically deliver bolus give interval , would otherwise idle period time . This technology could improve efficacy local anesthetic , thereby improve postoperative analgesia . Continuous peripheral nerve catheter show improve pain control several orthopedic surgical procedure compare opioids . However , uncommon patient experience breakthrough pain spite functional peripheral nerve block . Many time , breakthrough pain manage bolus local anesthetic administer anesthesia provider . Until recently , vast majority peripheral nerve catheter infusion pump capability provide constant rate local anesthetic administration . Newer technology allow infusion pump deliver intermittent mandatory bolus local anesthetic . This technique local anesthetic administration previously evaluate popliteal nerve block , knowledge never evaluate use interscalene nerve catheter . Currently , data would support idea bolus local anesthetic improve analgesia decrease side effect compare continuous infusion . However , little data evaluate optimal volume bolus , optimal speed delivery , optimal interval local anesthetic bolus .</detailed_description>
