	<brief_title>Study Safety , Efficacy PK EYN-1601 Dilation Pupil</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>EYN-1601 deliver topically microdose via proprietary delivery system ( Eyenovia Multi-Dose Device [ MDD ] system ) investigate dilation pupil ophthalmic examination procedure . Phenylephrine hydrochloride , sympathetic α1-adrenergic agonist , use pupil dilation 70 year . The mydriatic action phenylephrine due stimulation α1 receptor radial muscle iris , cause muscle fiber contract result pupil dilation . When conduct variety ophthalmological procedure include , necessary dilate ( enlarge ) pupil allow ophthalmologist unobstructed view lens retina , well optic nerve . The degree pupil dilation require somewhat dependent procedure perform . Eyenovia , Sponsor , specialty pharmaceutical company focus development ophthalmic drug product deliver small volume , ie , via microdosing , order maximize therapeutic control minimize systemic absorption . To achieve goal , Eyenovia develop drug/device combination product allow accurate topical ocular delivery control quantity specific active pharmaceutical ingredient . Phenylephrine know cause systemic cardiovascular effect patient dose via topical ocular route include hypertension , tachycardia , rarely , arrhythmia stroke , especially patient pre-existing heart condition . These risk even relevant phenylephrine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution 10 % use circumstance great degree mydriasis require . Microdosing Eyenovia MDD system expect significantly reduce eliminate risk allow degree mydriasis produce current approved product . Subjects ( healthy volunteer ) screen eligibility 12 subject meet inclusion/exclusion criterion enrol study . At 3 treatment visit , baseline measurement take two dos ( separate 5 minute ) eye ( OU ) 1 3 study drug administer ( 1 drug administer treatment visit . - EYN-1601 ophthalmic solution - Phenylephrine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution 2.5 % - Phenylephrine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution 2.5 % Subjects participate safety , efficacy , pharmacokinetic assessment . Subsequent visit must separate least 2 day may 1 week apart . Efficacy assess measurement pupil dilation pupilometer eye . Safety assessment include slit lamp examination ( SLE ) eye measurement vital sign ( blood pressure [ BP ] /heart rate [ HR ] ) adverse event , well ocular discomfort survey Absorption assess blood plasma analysis detect free phenylephrine .</detailed_description>
