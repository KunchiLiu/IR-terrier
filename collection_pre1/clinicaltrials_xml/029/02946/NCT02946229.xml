	<detailed_description>The purpose study enable longitudinal data collection library ultrasound image associate case data population vary sonographic finding . This data require support future engineering development new ultrasound technology intend use population , include semi-automated application , intend detect ultrasound signal associate extravascular lung fluid , cardiac velocity time integral ( VTI ) , inferior vena cava ( IVC ) collapsibility . While new technology use data collection study , image data varied sonographic finding essential engineering development activity .</detailed_description>
