	<detailed_description>A significant increase pertussis incidence report grow number country . This resurgence consider result limited durability aP-vaccine-induced immunity associate increased mortality young infant morbidity age group . As pertussis immunity acquire immunization infection short-lived , maintenance reactivation require repeat boost regular time point . Thus , novel strategy capable reactivate pertussis immunity old child , adolescent adult , include pregnant woman , need . A puzzling observation efficacy current acellular pertussis vaccine ( contain chemically-detoxified pertussis toxoid ( PT ) ) high infant child adolescent , vaccine efficacy limit rapidly wane . This may derive - least part - priming repeat immunization acellular vaccine contain chemically-detoxified PT thus induction antibody specific chemically-detoxified PT unable efficiently recognize native PT express B. pertussis . The development optimize acellular pertussis vaccine thus include antigen similar immunogenicity profile native PT deprive toxic property . This best achieved genetic rather chemical detoxification PT , result nontoxic immunogenic PT . Clinical study show good tolerability profile superior immunogenicity profile acellular pertussis vaccine include genetically-detoxified PT ( rPT ) adults adolescent previously prim whole-cell pertussis ( wP ) vaccine . As whole-cell vaccine express native PT , whether superior immunogenicity rPT observe adolescents/adults previously prim acellular pertussis vaccine contain chemically-detoxified PT key importance . This phase II randomize , observer-blind control study compare safety immunogenicity acellular pertussis vaccine include chemically genetically-detoxified pertussis toxin adolescent age 11-15 year . The primary objective ass immunogenicity genetically detoxify pertussis toxin ( rPT ) include novel acellular pertussis vaccine ( Pertagen® ) deliver intramuscular route adolescent previously prim boost chemically-detoxified PT , along Td-pur® comparison Boostrix® dTpa . The secondary objective ( 1 ) ass safety Pertagen® administer Td-pur® adolescent compare Boostrix® dTpa ( 2 ) ass humoral response elicit Pertagen® administer Td-pur® compare Boostrix® dTpa . In study , exploratory immunological measure also perform ( pending sufficient additional funding ) . These anticipated include : - The assessment antibody titer specific neutralize non-neutralizing epitope PT , competitive ELISA , ( Day 28 ) boost Pertagen® Boostrix® dTpa . - To assess cellular response PT boost Pertagen® Boostrix® dTpa . - To assess frequency phenotype PT-specific memory B cell response ( compare tetanus toxoid ) boost Pertagen® Boostrix® dTpa ( i.e . Day 0 Day 28 ) . - To characterize change cellular response follow boost Pertagen® Boostrix® dTpa Three vaccine use study . The BioNet-Asia study vaccine ( Pertagen® ) , Td-pur® ( Novartis/GSK ) concomitantly administer study vaccine , control Boostrix® dTpa . The investigational product Pertagen® manufacture , label , package release clinical use BioNet-Asia , accordance requirement Good Manufacturing Practices.Both Td-pur® Boostrix® dTpa vaccine use study commercially available Switzerland purchase study . One batch vaccine use entire study . All vaccine present 0.5 mL pre-filled syrinx administer intramuscular injection . The study vaccine Pertagen® Boostrix® dTpa administer non-dominant deltoid . If applicable , Td-pur® administer contralateral deltoid . At Day 0 , eligible subject randomize 1:1 ratio one follow vaccine group : Group 1 Pertagen® Td-pur 30 volunteer Group 2 Boostrix® dTpa 30 volunteer A randomization list contain subject number vaccine group assignment establish provided clinical investigator . Each participant immunize accord vaccine group assignment . At study site , Principal investigator designate blind unblinded team order keep observer-blind design study . The unblinded personal responsible study vaccine preparation , handle , storage accountability , immunization . The blinded team responsible assess adverse event . The laboratory staff perform immunological assay also blind . After vaccination , volunteer observe 30 minute study site immediate post-immunization reaction . Reactogenicity safety assess study visit clinical trial unit ( CTU ) Day 0 Day 28 immunization . At Day 0 ( Visit 1 , vaccination day ) , Diary Card distribute study volunteer record post-immunization local systemic reaction adverse event . At Day 28 ( Visit 2 ) , investigator reconcile transcribe Diary Card information CRF . Post-immunization local systemic reaction collect monitor 7 day vaccination . All adverse event , include SAEs , collect monitor 28 day vaccination ( Visit 2 ) . Study participant contact phone Day 7 confirm adverse reaction subside . Should case , unscheduled visit consider appropriate . All AEs SAEs occur within 28 day follow treatment observe Investigator report volunteer , whether attribute study intervention , record CRF . All AEs result volunteer 's withdrawal study follow satisfactory resolution occurs , non-study related causality assign ( volunteer consent ) . Sample size calculation This phase II randomize , observer-blind control pilot study compare safety immunogenicity acellular pertussis vaccine include chemically genetically-detoxified pertussis toxin adolescents previously immunize acellular vaccine . The sample size study base clinical practical consideration formal statistical power calculation . Where applicable , 2-sided test 5 % significance level utilized multiplicity adjustment . P-values consider exploratory . Sixty volunteer randomize total , 30 group . Safety analysis The safety analysis include randomize subject receive dose study vaccine . The overall percentage subject least one spontaneously report adverse event , date onset 28 day vaccination tabulate exact 95 % confidence interval , type adverse event ; severity ; causality . They display vaccine group frequency percentages ITT data set . All report adverse event start post-vaccination tabulate . If give disease already report ongoing first visit medical history page , count tabulated vaccine emergent adverse event worsens immunization study vaccine . Serious adverse event discontinuation due adverse event ( ) describe detail vaccine group . Immunogenicity analyse The primary immunogenicity endpoint ass immune response Pertagen® - compare Boostrix® dTpa - measure Day 28 geometric mean concentration ( GMC ) neutralize antibody PT . The immunogenicity end-points include : - GMCs PT , FHA , tetanus diphtheria-toxoid specific IgG antibody measure ELISA - Seroresponse rate PT , FHA , tetanus diphtheria-toxoid specific IgG antibody measure ELISA - Reverse cumulative distribution curve PT neutralize antibody , PT , FHA , tetanus diphtheria-toxoid IgG antibody - To compare PT-specific response elicit Pertagen® adolescent previously immunize ( study ) ( BioNet Phase II/III TDA202 ) acellular pertussis vaccines The following descriptive statistic provide variable : number subject , percentage , mean , geometric mean , standard deviation , median , minimum , maximum , range . Quality Control Quality Assurance Procedure Approved site-specific SOPs use clinical laboratory site . Monitoring perform accord ICH Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) Centre de Recherche Clinique ( CRC ) University Hospital Geneva . Following Monitoring Plan write SOPs , monitor verify clinical trial conduct data generate , document report compliance protocol , GCP applicable regulatory requirement .
