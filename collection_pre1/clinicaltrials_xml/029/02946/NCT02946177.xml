	<brief_title>Effect Influenza Vaccination Donor Egg Recipient Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Since 2004 flu vaccination recommend American College Obstetricians Gynecologists ( ACOG ) Advisory Committee Immunization Practices ( ACIP ) pregnant woman flu season , regardless trim pregnancy . Many study examine safety influenza vaccination find benefit beyond simple prevention maternal infection include reduction still birth . Recently evidence emerge woman receive flu vaccination less likely experience premature labor . The investigator hypothesize maternal benefit influenza vaccination might base prevention flu , possibly secondary induction immune system pathways favor immunological tolerance . Induction immune system pathway favor immunological tolerance long consider possible path improve embryo implantation reduce miscarriage , though topic still somewhat controversial . Patients undergo donor egg recipient cycle randomize two stratum : 1 . History recurrent miscarriage implantation failure 2 . No history recurrent miscarriage implantation failure Consenting patient randomize receive either influenza vaccine saline placebo . Vaccination occur 10 day initiate anticipated menses fertility treatment cycle start . All patient receive offer second injection time negative pregnancy test time sign-out clinical pregnancy . The second injection either placebo influenza vaccination depend original randomization . Patients clinical staff remain blinded original treatment assignment , except study coordinator single staff member assign administer injection .</detailed_description>
