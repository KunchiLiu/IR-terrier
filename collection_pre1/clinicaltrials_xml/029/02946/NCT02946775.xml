	<detailed_description>Specific Aim 1 . To define characterize etiologic agent community acquire bacteremic syndrome young Nigerian child Hypothesis 1a : role vaccine-preventable infection cause Pneumococcus , Hib etiology CABS currently underestimate due widespread use non-prescription antibiotic . Hypothesis 1b : Salmonella specie lead cause persistent febrile illness ( fever &gt; 2 week ) young Nigerian child . Specific Aim 2 . To determine role respiratory virus promote severity bacteremic radio-logic pneumonia Hypothesis 2 : Influenza virus promote severity bacteremic pneumonia Specific Aim 3 . To determine acute host inflammatory response profile CABS associate respiratory distress Hypothesis 3a : Bacteremia induces pattern host inflammatory profile distinct induce malaria respiratory viral infection . Hypothesis 3b : Clinical presentation outcome ( death , survival prolonged hospitalization ) associate pro-inflammatory anti-inflammatory cytokine chemokine dissonance . The global burden childhood death largely borne develop country . Of estimate 10 million death occur child age less 5 year , 90 % occur develop country half sub Saharan Africa . Causes death largely classify base syndrome presentation , pneumonia , malaria , diarrhea , meningitis septicemia recently attempt make define etiologic pathogen responsible death , important step implement primary prevention . In sub Saharan Africa , malaria long time perceive leading cause childhood death recent study Kenya suggest death fact cause bacteremia . However , disease burden varies region disease burden perception also vary , particularly malaria endemic region clinical presentation acute malaria , pneumonia sepsis often indistinguishable . The situation compound region malaria present all-year round child bacteremic may also malaria parasitemia healthy child may asymptomatic parasitemia . These complex overlapping feature present challenge efficient clinical management implementation appropriate preventive measure . In develop country , due lack local data , clinical management recommendation often obtain World Health Organization common condition base integrated management childhood illness approach 3 . In setting , diagnosis base limited number clinical syndrome . However , seriously ill child often meet criterion several clinical syndrome , could cause several viral bacterial pathogen , treatment empiric management approach non-specific . A key component clinical management malaria endemic area high incidence invasive bacterial disease initiation antibiotic treatment anti-malarials . While approach provide easy scheme , pathogen-specific significant risk promote long-term antibiotic resistance due prescription antibiotic paradoxically , also risk increase mortality morbidity due inappropriate medication . An etiology-based management approach would effective also provide data explore primary preventive measure immunization . Causes bacteremia vary report several sub-Saharan country high under-five childhood mortality . These include study Malawi Central African Republic Non-typhoidal Salmonella ( NTS ) predominate report Nigeria staphylococcus aureus lead cause bacteremia young child . There study Nigeria , populate country sub-Saharan Africa , study identify S. pneumoniae Hib important pathogen etiology community acquire bacteremic illness invasive bacterial disease young child . The disparity prevalence different bacterial pathogen across country likely due different study entry criterion , age group , bacterial culture method prevalence antibiotic exposure population . A high rate antibiotic use likely select resistant bacterial strain population . It notable study identify S. pneumoniae lead cause bacteremia study utilize automated Bactec culture system . Thus determine true burden vaccine-preventable bacterial disease set would warrant use culture-based molecular microbiology technique would overcome problem poor sensitivity secondary partially treated infection . Of childhood illness commonly associate bacteremia , pneumonia lead cause death , Streptococcus pneumonia make significant contribution death report Gambia limit data West African sub region . Thus study focus provide understanding etiologic agent bacteremia pneumonia . Determination cause pneumonia remain challenge , since bacterial blood culture , current `` gold standard '' useful pneumonia associate bacteremia positive 10-15 % case . The vast majority pneumonia associate bacteremia ascertain cause case warrant use lung aspirate , specific invasive procedure use research setting . When clinical diagnosis pneumonia make use WHO guideline , sensitive poorly specific , fraction radio-logic abnormality variable small fraction still , confluent alveolar density culminate lobar consolidation . When lung consolidation readily assessable chest wall , sensitive specific approach etiologic diagnosis use percutaneous lung aspirate consider invasive use research setting . This approach improve etiologic diagnosis 18 % use blood culture alone 52 % . Since procedure invasive reserve selected case , cause non-bacteremic pneumonia remain poorly define . At population level , another approach determine burden disease-attributable etiologic agent population use efficacious vaccine . For example , The Gambia , pneumococcal conjugate vaccine efficacy trial associate 37 % reduction radio-logic pneumonia 16 % reduction all-cause childhood mortality ; important testament under-estimation true disease burden attributable pneumococcus poor sensitivity current diagnostic method detection invasive pneumococcal disease young child . While development application new generation vaccine major advancement huge potential save several thousand life , also provide sensitive tool probe burden vaccine-attributable preventable disease population expensive . The determination cause pneumonia childhood present challenge agent virus often identify respiratory secretion role patho-genesis severe pneumonia develop country less well define . Understanding host immune response infection critical providing insight treatment modality , since response necessarily pathogen , determine outcome . This observation support observation prompt diagnosis initiation antibiotic treatment always avert death recently report study Gambia , delay mortality report within 28 day hospital discharge appropriate in-patient care hospital . The reason delay death unknown prolong immunologic dissonance ( imbalance pro-inflammatory anti-inflammatory cytokine ) likely contribute factor . This deserve investigation since delayed death due immunologic dissonance , death may avert use steroid immunomodulators , addition antibiotic . Characterization host inflammatory response among child community acquire pneumonia may facilitate understand host inflammatory response , provide prognostic tool clinician identify potential therapeutic target . Children present acute febrile illness , respiratory distress malaria endemic region may severe malaria , bacteremia , sepsis and/or pneumonia . A number study explore acute inflammatory marker C-reactive protein procalcitonin report significant overlap serum concentration proteins condition justify diagnostic use setting . While clinical presentation respiratory distress pneumonia malaria may similar , understanding molecular basis clinical sign could provide valuable information diagnosis treatment . In summary , community acquire bacteremic syndrome malaria endemic region Africa present diagnostic conundrum physician pose important clinical management dilemma warrant evaluation . This study propose take advantage new molecular genomic technology address challenge ultimate goal define etiologic agent community acquire bacteremic syndrome Nigerian child generate information host inflammatory response would useful develop primary secondary preventative measure .</detailed_description>
