	<brief_title>Subcutaneous EEG Epilepsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The problem unrecognized seizure common certain type epilepsy . Electroencephalography ( EEG ) excellent method seizure identification recognition , , feasible perform EEG recording day outside hospital laboratory . A novel device develop , might remedy . The device EEG-electrode subcutaneous implantation connect external data storage device . The investigator study hypothesize device might useful tool ultra-long-term epilepsy monitoring . The study aim investigate . While device might use diagnose epilepsy , likely good observation tool study aim determine . Subjects include patient mesial temporal lobe epilepsy high seizure frequency . These device implant . Study phase 1 proof concept determine whether device actually able detect epileptic seizure . This take place admission perform simultaneous recording ordinary scalp EEG investigational device . Study phase 2 home monitoring prove device actually provide clinically useful information regard seizure outpatient set . The study require 9 visit subject course 4-6 month . The investigational device explanted approximately 75 day wear . Because huge amount EEGraphical data generate long-term monitoring , automated seizure detection algorithm develop specifically device . The algorithm train know data adjust along way deem necessary . All finding automate algorithm double-checked neurophysiologist/neurologist . Data regard sleep quality collect part actigraphy part daily questionnaire deliver smartphone . Cognitive performance testing , seizure log/description medication log also handle via specially design smartphone app .</detailed_description>
