	<detailed_description>Patients enrol participation randomly assign intervention 'care usual ' group ( 1:1 ) . Patients assigned intervention group receive 3 month intervention aim enhance self-management lifestyle . The intervention consist 4 component . 1 . Behavioral prompt ( Do 's ) Do Something Different Programme The Do Something Different Program previously develop evaluate ( ref ) . For current study , programme adapt population interest ( CAD , HF , HT patient ) together behavioural expert cardiologist . The program aim change behavioural habit increase flexibility subsequently change habit associate unhealthy lifestyle distress , find associate hypertension cardiovascular risk . The program develop input cardiologist , psychologist , patient . 'Typical ' behavioural risk besides hypertension identify addressed within program . To adapt program patient ' need , patient , prior start program , assess regard functioning , distress , personality Do 's match personal habit challenge change . After assess patient personality profile intervention provide 11 week . Patients receive total 32 Do 's / message period . The Do 's match personal profile . 2 . Care-Portal All patient randomize intervention group also receive Care-Portal ( Docobo Ltd. ) instal home . The Care-Portal used gather ECG data blood pressure daily basis . The Care-Portal send physiological data directly cardiologist able access via online platform contact patient necessary . In addition , patient receive Do 's trough care-portal . The Care-Portal CE-marked device previously successfully use implemented support patient chronic condition . 3 . Blood pressure monitor All patient intervention group receive digital blood pressure monitor 'UA -767 Plus ' CE-marked device clinical use . Patients ask measure blood pressure daily basis record value care-portal . 4 . Moves App For future study within Do CHANGE project , Do Something Different programme want focus provide 'Contextual Do 's ' patient receive behavioural prompt moment behaviour take place . In order reach goal get insight patient behavioral patter utmost importance . Hence , data gather within current study one exploratory objective use GPS data . This give insight use input future study . All patient participate intervention provide 'Moves ' app log activity anonymously . This information automatically available research purpose . Patients receive push message app feedback . `` Moves '' automatic diary patient life . The daily storyline map show , , much person move . The application automatically record walk , cycling , run do . The app always active background , 's need start stop . Just keep phone pocket bag . The app consumes battery power , nightly charge recommend . With typical phone use , smartphone run Moves enough battery power last day . The optional Battery Saving Mode Moves iPhone save 40 % battery . The Moves API use build new apps , integrate exist service visualise data . The API design apps service server component . Individual user need give permission access data . However , provide kind personal information optional , data collection do anonymously well . Moves use OAuth 2.0 authentication authorization actual authorization happen Moves app . During study API use collect location base data participant . This data use develop location base responsive Do program . During study participant receive feedback application . In settings notification turn . Besides , app use without set goal account . The thing participant ask install app fill unique code data collection . Participants use smartphone able install app use .</detailed_description>
