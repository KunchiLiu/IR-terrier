	<brief_title>Handgrip Strength Value Predicting Mechanical Ventilation Weaning</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous study evidence Intensive Care Unit acquire peripheral muscle weakness may lead delayed mechanical ventilation weaning ( i.e difficult prolong wean accord guideline ) . Nevertheless , study ever test association handgrip strength extubation outcome . The investigator generate hypothesis ICU acquire weakness , test handgrip strength might associate extubation outcome . The investigator plan include 240 patient . Handgrip strength monitor , along full muscular assessment Medical Research Council score attend physiotherapist . Physicians charge patient blind value wean protocol continue accord guideline .</detailed_description>
