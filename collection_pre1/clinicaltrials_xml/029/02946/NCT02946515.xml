	<detailed_description>The prevalence childhood obesity triple within last twenty-five year ( Skelton et al. , 2009 ) . Interventions target child high priority child bear great lifetime health risk overweight obesity ( Ogden et al. , 2007 ; Franks et al. , 2010 ) .

Thus , effective strategy support pediatric primary care provider effort intervene address childhood obesity need . Building successes achieve Phase I study , SIMmersion LLC , collaboration Dr. Nancy Sherwood HealthPartners Institute , Dr. Jayne Fulkerson University Minnesota , Dr. Michael Fleming Northwestern University , expand Phase I simulation prototype , utilize feedback provide team independent expert . The innovative computer-based training system interactive role-play simulation provide health care provider much need experiential opportunity develop skill conduct discussion parent child obesity . The product 's efficacy evaluate randomize control trial ( RCT ) ; 100 pediatric , family practice , nurse clinician trainees various level experience recruit participate . Half participant randomly assign intervention group use newly develop simulation product develop skill half participant randomly assign wait-list control group ; primary outcome performance role play train actor 3 month follow-up .</detailed_description>
