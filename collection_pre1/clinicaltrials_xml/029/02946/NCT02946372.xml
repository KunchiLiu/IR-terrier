	<brief_summary>Macular hole infrequent retinal pathology ( 2 4/1000 ) often affect people age 60 , twice common woman men . The vast majority case idiopathic . Without treatment , macular hole evolve series stage extension diameter ( 500 micron high value ) . With fully develop macular hole , patient complain metamorphopsia decrease visual acuity . This pathology clearly benefit advance microsurgery well understand pathophysiology . Macular hole treatment evolve include small-gauge par plana vitrectomy without internal limiting membrane ( ILM ) peel placement intraocular gas tamponade . The postoperative closure rate close 80 % , strongly depend initial characteristic hole , diameter remain main prognostic factor . Thus macular hole &lt; 400 micron , closure rate close 92 % drop 56 % macular hole 400 micron . In case surgical failure , one reoperations propose , low closure rate . The quest surgical technique present great success rate common goal retinologists . Here investigator propose new surgical technique , derive FLAP method , consist inner limit membrane transposition . The objective study evaluate feasibility new surgical technique treatment macular hole already operate without macular hole closure , allow patient new therapeutic alternative . The success technique confirm detect postoperatively presence transpose internal limiting membrane foveal region .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Patient age 18 , 2 . Patient already receive least macular hole surgery , 3 . Period least 4 month since last macular hole surgery , 4 . Patient underwent peel internal limiting membrane , 5 . Presents OCT open criterion macular hole , 6 . The presence cataract preoperative clinical examination indication . Its removal integrate surgery , 7 . Patient sign consent form 1 . Patient againstindication surgical anesthetic , 2 . Macular Hole `` flat open '' close , 3 . No progressive macular pathology presence macular hole ( retinal detachment , Macular degeneration relate age ) Idiopathic secondary macular hole eligible already operate prior internal limit membrane coat . 4 .
