	<brief_summary>This study ( MAINTAIN -II ) aim examine effect audio playlist [ without Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation ( RAS ) ] weekly volume physical activity . Participants randomize 3 Interventions : Control ( standard , usual care ) , Audiobook , Tempo-pace Synchronized Playlists ( TSP ) . The investigator also aim explore effect intervention mood , perceive exertion dissociative attention among patient participate cardiac rehabilitation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Physical activity associate 35 % decrease cardiovascular mortality - direct result exercise vasculature indirect result exercise lower CVD risk factor lipids blood pressure . With physical inactivity one major independent risk factor CVD , structure exercise cardiac rehabilitation program implement encourage adherence physical activity among patient cardiac related issue . Clinical trial evidence demonstrate irrefutable mortality morbidity benefit associate cardiac rehabilitation especially among patient establish CVD . The mechanism improve outcome likely multifactorial , include improved preventative self-management , physical activity volume , cardiopulmonary fitness . Unfortunately real-world outcome benefit associate cardiac rehabilitation undermine behavioural attrition , programmatic drop suboptimal physical activity adherence pattern mirror broader healthy population enrol cardiac rehabilitation . Unfortunately real-world outcome benefit associate cardiac rehabilitation undermine attrition rate 50 % post rehabilitation . The goal would therefore introduce co-intervention encourages long-term exercise adherence maximal health improvement cardiac rehabilitation population , might also broader applicability non-cardiac rehab population . The prior study , The Music Activity INTervention Adherence Improvement Neurological entrainment ( MAINTAIN -1 ) , examine use Tempo Synchronized Playlists ( TSP ) improve exercise adherence within cardiac rehabilitation program . Weekly volume physical activity compare group assign 3 intervention : control group receive Usual Care , TSP , Tempo-pace Synchronized Playlists Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation ( RAS ) . Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation neurological rehabilitation technique use accentuate tempo-pace synchrony . The group assign TSP intervention demonstrate significantly high volume weekly exercise usual care control group . Furthermore , group randomize TSP RAS partook twice amount weekly physical activity TSP group without RAS . Our prior study several limitation include small sample size inability examine mechanism RAS tempo-based audio-playlist synchronization mediate increase physical activity . The objective current study build previous research examine reproducibility efficacy explore mechanism mood , perceive exertion dissociative attention , preference-based tempo-pace synchronized playlist improve exercise adherence among patient participate cardiac rehabilitation . Participants randomize 3 Interventions : Usual Care , Audiobooks , TSP , assign month 2 3 program . The Usual Care group feature nest design half patient randomize receive silent track month 2 , half receive white noise . This sequence reverse month 3 . Within TSP intervention , 2 nested design test . The first test RAS non-RAS . Half patient randomize receive TSP RAS month 2 study , half receive TSP without RAS month 2 . The sequence reverse month 3 . The second determine effect train compare 'active ' vs. 'passive ' . Within active group , participant train exercise music . The passive group train . Cardiac Rehabilitation provide ideal test-case program examine music co-interventions , mirror behavioural attrition experience structure unstructured exercise activity . Additionally , music tempo-pace synchronization strategy appropriate setting help regulate exercise pace prescribed patient program .</detailed_description>
