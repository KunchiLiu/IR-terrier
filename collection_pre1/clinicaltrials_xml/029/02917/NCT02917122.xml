	<brief_summary>Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) one common neurological disease manifest movement disturbance . The concomitant psychiatric symptom , especially depression , often observe also great impact patient ' quality life . The treatment depressive symptom PD antidepressant majority remain variable inefficient , complicate disease prognosis . Transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) non-invasive brain modulation technique demonstrate improve psychiatric disease major depression . In study investigator assess combine effect tDCS sertraline treatment depression PD . Ten session tDCS two week apply follow-up evaluation continue bi-weekly one month complete session . The efficacy tDCS v sertraline compare evaluated behavioral cognitive outcome . In addition , investigator evaluate baseline dopaminergic activity brain could predict treatment outcome use SPECT imaging . The investigator aim establish therapeutic parameter safety criterion tDCS add-on alternative therapy , enhance overall clinical efficacy treatment depression PD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study design This study factorial randomize , placebo-control trial , include 2 group : 'sertraline ' ( sertraline + sham tDCS ) , 'combined treatment ' ( sertraline + active tDCS ) . It plan recruit 20 subject group , result together 40 participant . Patients take 12 tDCS session ( 30min session ) : first 10 consecutive session two week ( Monday Friday ) , 2 follow-up session schedule 2 4 week consecutive treatment .
