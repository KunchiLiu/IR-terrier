	<brief_summary>Diagnostic imaging ( DI ) test ( example , x-ray test , ultrasound , CT scan , MRIs ) use health care provider help diagnose patient illness , decision regard test order subjective . As result , physician order test others . Ordering rate clinician see similar kind patient show considerably different , suggest many test unnecessary . DI currently account 6.6 % Canadian hospital budget , percentage may much high Newfoundland test order rate almost twice national average . However , cost concern . Over-testing lead unnecessary test follow-up harmless finding , case CT , large dos potentially harmful radiation . The purpose study assess DI test-ordering family physician across Eastern Health region , compare test order rate jurisdiction . We suspect many clinician aware order DI test peer . We therefore develop `` report card '' family physicians province show many test order compare physician region . We expect physician over-ordering DI test reduce number test order receive report card . This low-cost way potentially prevent expensive over-ordering DI test easily implement province 's health region elsewhere .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Diagnostic Imaging Utilization Reports</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose trial determine `` report card '' family physicians province show many test order compare physician region result reduce test order rate . Family physicians general practitioner stratify ( group ) community practice within Eastern Health , randomize intervention `` report card '' group usual practice `` report card '' group . Communities few five physician group similar community stratify randomization purpose . Physicians intervention group provide semi-annual ( every 6 month ) report card outline number CT scan , ultrasound plain x-rays ordered patient primary provider . We assume primary provider frequent biller primary care service . Intervention participant receive link report card via email Newfoundland Labrador Medical Association ( NLMA ) two-step process : The initial email give brief description report contain link redirects clinician secure web page display individual clinician diagnostic imaging utilization prior six month period compare aggregate peer region .</detailed_description>
