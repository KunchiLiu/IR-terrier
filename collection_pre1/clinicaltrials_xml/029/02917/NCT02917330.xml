	<brief_summary>The purpose randomize control intervention study explore effect physiotherapy intervention target contract spastic hamstring muscle child bilateral spastic cerebral palsy ( CP ) , GMFCS I-III : A stretch routine target hamstring ( psoas short ) , progressive strengthen program muscle extend low extremity ( quadriceps , gluteus maximus triceps surae ) Study hypothesis : Stretching hamstring strength train extend muscle low extremity child bilateral spastic cerebral palsy increase popliteal angle , active knee extension , gait function .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stretching Strength Training Improved Gait Function Children With Spastic Cerebral Palsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The key intervention : 16 week three treatment session week . Minimum pause two treatment session one day . Week 1 2 : To assure correct dosage exercise satisfactory education session do home , three session implement physiotherapist first two week . From week 3 : Two treatment/training session physiotherapist one short training session home . Maintenance intervention : From week 17 week nr 32. ; One session pr . week perform home , together assistant school physiotherapist . How accomplished depend feasible child parent . The physiotherapy session : 2 session pr week . 5-10 min . warm treadmill bike . A stretching exercise hamstring ( psoas shorten ; ≤ 5º hip extension ) 3 strength exercise target muscle extend hip , knee ankle . The intervention expect last 30 min . extra session top usual physiotherapy intervention give child . Home session : One session pr . week , last 10-15 min . No need warm . The session contend one stretch exercise hamstring one strength exercise . The exercise modify individually child able home . Exercise registration : The physiotherapist ask register session perform week . The reason session perform register ( scheme attach ) . The stretching ( exercise schema p.3 ) : Two stretch exercise perform hamstring , psoas muscle short ( ≤ 5º hip extension ) also stretch perform psoas . The stretch shall painful child . The strength training exercise ( exercise schema p.4 5 ) : The strength training perform following principle `` Progressive Resistance Exercise '' ( PRE ) recommendations The National Strength Conditioning Association ( NSCA ) concern strength training children12 . The recommended weight resistance child familiar strength train 60-80 % 1RM ( Repetition Maximum = maximum weight lift one repetition ) , 2- 3 set 8-12 repetition , 2 -3 time per week . Verscuhen collegues13 recommendation concern strength training protocol child CP take account : multi -joint exercise , also singe - joint exercise , extend rest exercise ( min 2-3 minute ) , minimum 12 week intervention child 7 year age . The standing exercise shall perform back pack ( everyone intervention group get one ) possible load weights/bottles water . Customization weight resistance Children CP likely diverse accord physical condition 1 Repetition Maximum ( 1RM ) likely difficult perform . For estimation optimal individualize resistance throughout period intervention modify test shall perform . The test perform child understood complete exercise correct , first two week . Until physiotherapist map child 's strength skill order recognize wright amount weight child 12 repetition 2 series . As week 3 3 series per exercise . Recommendations study do Sholtes et all14 use guide optimal weight dosage . In study find 8 RM sit- stand exercise , CP GMFCS I-III weight 35 % , 30 % 25 % respectively body weight . Performance RM test : Starting 3 repetition without resistance throughout range moment . Every repetition shall perform correct control passible throughout range moment speed 2-3 sec . per extension/flexion movement . If one repetition carry incorrectly respect speed movement quality shall count . The RM test shall conduct first time end second week ( 12 RM x 3 series ) , next time week 5 . ( 10 RM x 3 series ) , week 8 . ( 8 RM x 3 series ) , finally week 14 . ( 8 RM x 3 series ) . When child 12 , 10 8 repetition respectively , shall add weight . The weight change shall register registration form . RM test shall perform exercise nr 1 ) ,2 ) 3 ) . Exercise nr 4 ) mostly awareness exercise focus quality ability activate m.vastus medialis max extension knee prone position .</detailed_description>
