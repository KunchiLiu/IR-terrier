	<brief_title>Safety Preliminary Efficacy FAB117-HC Patients With Acute Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>FAB117-HC investigational medicinal product whose active substance HC016 , allogeneic adipose-derived adult mesenchymal stem cell expand pulsed H2O2 . The main purpose study evaluate safety tolerability single administration FAB117-HC use : ) two sequential escalate dos administer 72 120 hour post-injury , patient acute traumatic SCI AIS grade A ; b ) determine maximum tolerate dose administer 48 72 h post-injury patient ASIA Impairment Scale ( AIS ) grade A B . The study include also initial exploration efficacy . Treatment administer intramedullary injection injure spinal cord , decompression stabilization surgery ( DSS ) fracture . DSS routinely perform almost SCI patient . The study divide two phase : Phase 1 ( open label ) : 6 AIS A patient lesion locate D5 D10 include 2 sequential cohort . Phase 2 ( randomize , control , double-blind ) : 40 AIS A B patient lesion locate D1 D12 , randomly divide two group ( control treat ) balance AIS grade .</detailed_description>
