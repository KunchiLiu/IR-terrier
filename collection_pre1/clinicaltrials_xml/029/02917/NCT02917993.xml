	<criteria>Histologically cytologically confirm unresectable locally advanced ( Stage IIIB ) metastatic ( Stage IV ) NSCLC . Documented evidence somatic activate mutation EGFR ( eg , G719X , exon 19 deletion , L858R , L861Q ) tumor tissue sample . If tissue sample available , EGFR mutation status may determine circulate tumor DNA obtain blood sample use validate approved test kit . Phase 1 : Subjects must previously receive progressed treatment EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) . Additional line systemic therapy include investigational agent locally advance metastatic NSCLC allow . Phase 2 : Subjects must receive 1 prior line therapy locally advance metastatic NSCLC . Firstline treatment must include EGFR TKI , subject must document disease progression follow treatment . Subjects disease progress 6 month completion neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy chemoradiation therapy eligible receive EGFR TKI firstline treatment advance NSCLC . Subjects must evidence T790M mutation tumor tissue plasma obtain disease progression treatment EGFR TKI . Radiographically measurable evaluable disease per RECIST v1.1 . Known active central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases . Subjects CNS metastasis complete course therapy would eligible provide clinically stable least 4 week study entry , define follow : No evidence new enlarge CNS metastasis new neurological symptom attributable CNS metastasis . Subjects receive concomitant corticosteroid must stable decrease dose least 4 week first dose study treatment anticonvulsant least 4 week study entry . Laboratory parameter outside protocoldefined range . Clinically significant abnormality find ECG . Clinically significant uncontrolled cardiac disease . Past history interstitial lung disease ( ILD ) , drug induce ILD , radiation pneumonitis require steroid treatment , evidence clinically active ILD . Current previous malignancy within 2 year study entry , except cure basal squamous cell skin cancer , superficial bladder cancer , prostate intraepithelial neoplasm , carcinoma situ cervix , noninvasive malignancy . Concurrent anticancer therapy ( eg , chemotherapy , radiation therapy , surgery , immunotherapy , biologic therapy , hormonal therapy ) . Any previous use Janus kinase ( JAK ) inhibitor , osimertinib , EGFRdirected therapy T790Mmt NSCLC .</criteria>
