	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study side effect best dose ruxolitinib phosphate give together chemotherapy donor stem cell transplant treat patient myelofibrosis . Ruxolitinib phosphate may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , fludarabine phosphate melphalan , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving ruxolitinib phosphate together chemotherapy donor stem cell transplant may help stop growth cell bone marrow , include normal blood-forming cell ( stem cell ) cancer cell . It may also stop patient 's immune system reject donor 's stem cell . When healthy stem cell donor infused patient may help patient 's bone marrow make stem cell , red blood cell , white blood cell , platelet . The donated stem cell may also replace patient 's immune cell help destroy remain cancer cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Among dose level test , determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) recommend phase II dose ( RP2D ) ruxolitinib phosphate ( ruxolitinib ) , give part reduce intensity allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant ( HCT ) , patient myelofibrosis . II . To determine addition ruxolitinib safe evaluation toxicity include : type , frequency , severity , attribution , time course duration . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To characterize evaluate hematologic recovery , donor cell engraftment immune reconstitution cell count flow cytometry lymphocyte subset . II . To estimate cumulative incidence acute graft-versus-host disease ( aGVHD ) non-relapse mortality ( NRM ) 100-days post transplant . III . To estimate cumulative incidence chronic GVHD 1- 2-years post transplant . IV . To estimate probability overall progression-free survival ( OS/PFS ) 1- 2-years post transplant . V. To characterize change aGVHD biomarkers ( Reg-3 alpha , soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor I [ sTNF RI ] , IL2R alpha ) , janus associate kinase ( JAK ) -regulated pro-inflammatory cytokine ( i.e . IL-6 , TNF alpha , CRP , beta 2microglobulin ) STAT3 phosphorylation ( downstream JAK signal ) time aGVHD status/grade . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study ruxolitinib phosphate . PREPARATIVE REGIMEN : Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously ( IV ) day -9 -5 , melphalan IV 20 minute day -4 , ruxolitinib phosphate orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day -3 30 taper 2-3 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . GVHD PROPHYLAXIS : Patients receive tacrolimus IV continuously begin day -3 convert PO daily patient able tolerate absorb oral medication . Patients also receive sirolimus PO daily begin day -3 . Treatment continue absence GVHD . STEM CELL TRANSPLANT : Patients undergo allogeneic HCT day 0 . After completion study treatment , patient follow 2 year .</detailed_description>
