	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) common sustain cardiac arrhythmia occur 1-2 % general population . AF associate debilitate symptoms confers increase risk death , stroke , heart failure hospitalization . As need effective therapy AF . In particularly catheter base therapy , limit need chronic drug therapy , become widely accept . The development AF require trigger susceptible substrate . Ectopic activity originate within pulmonary vein ( PVs ) widely recognise factor genesis paroxysmal AF , whilst electrical , contractile structural remodelling atrial myocardium important contribute factor arrhythmogenic substrate AF . An early strategy paroxysmal AF ( PAF ) target ectopic trigger come PV via ostial segmental ablation ( OSA ) . Here radiofrequency ( RF ) ablation apply close PV ostia sit early signal , usually PVs electrically isolate left atrium ( LA ) . This approach result success rate , regard freedom AF single procedure , 65-90 % 1 year closer 50 % 5 year . The recognition PV stenosis complication RF delivery within PV , well recognition initiation site could locate antrum lead shift ablation strategy towards wider encirclement PVs use wide area circumferential ablation ( WACA ) use electroanatomical mapping guide RF delivery . This result improved success rate head-to-head comparison OSA possible relates substrate modification inherent approach . Recurrence AF remain problematic follow ablation . Pulmonary vein reconnection ablation think contribute majority recurrent episode AF paroxysmal AF . Electrical isolation PVs often achievable WACA alone - 95 % patient residual connection follow WACA alone one study . Most clinicians juncture look obvious gap line ablate early PV signal . If unsuccessful often necessary resort OSA achieve PV isolation . In essence large proportion PV isolation procedure , start WACA strategy , fact hybrid WACA OSA . This potential increase complication rate risk PV stenosis reduce efficacy omit important substrate modification allow residual connection part antrum LA . The introduction Rhythmia , novel electroanatomical mapping system potential rapidly acquire high density electroanatomical data , may allow alternative strategy efficient target gap WACA line . The pilot data show system particularly adept assess gap ablation line include WACA line . Mapping target gap may hold key efficiently complete PV isolation initial WACA line perform . RATIONALE FOR CURRENT STUDY Research Question : Can ostial segmental ablation avoid wide area circumferential ablation ( WACA ) use Rhythmia high density mapping system ? Hypothesis : The current study design test hypothesis high density map use Rhythmia enhance operator 's ability electrically isolate PVs without unnecessary excessive ablation OSA</detailed_description>
