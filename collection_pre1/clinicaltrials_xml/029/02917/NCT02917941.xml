	<brief_title>A Phase 2 , Open-Label , Multicenter Study Ixazomib Plus Lenalidomide Dexamethasone Adult Japanese Patients With Relapsed and/or Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase 2 , open label , single arm , multicenter study evaluate efficacy safety ixazomib plus lenalidomide dexamethasone Japanese patient relapse and/or refractory multiple myeloma ( MM ) . The patient population consist adult men woman confirm diagnosis MM , receive 1 3 prior line therapy , meet outline eligibility criterion . Patients receive study drug ( ixazomib 4.0 mg ) Days 1 , 8 , 15 plus lenalidomide ( 25 mg ) Days 1 21 dexamethasone ( 40 mg ) Days 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 28-day cycle . Patients may continue receive treatment progressive disease ( PD ) unacceptable toxicity , whichever come first . Dose modification may make base toxicity . Patients low creatinine clearance &lt; 60 mL/min receive reduce lenalidomide dose 10 mg daily Days 1 21 28-day cycle . The lenalidomide dose may escalate 15 mg daily 2 cycle patient respond treatment tolerate treatment . If renal function normalizes ( ie , creatinine clearance &gt; = 60 mL/min ) patient continue tolerate treatment , lenalidomide may escalate 25 mg daily . Treatment period define 28-day cycle . Patients see regular treatment cycle interval participate study : four time treatment cycle first 2 cycle , twice treatment cycle 3rd cycle , treatment cycle remainder participation active treatment , applicable , PFS OS follow-up phase study . Response assess investigator accord International Myeloma Working Group criteria patient every 4 week PD . Central laboratory data use serum M-protein , urine M-protein serum free light chain . All patient follow survival progression . Patients contact every 12 week death termination study sponsor . The study close 24 month enrollment last patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Male female Japanese participant 20 year age old . 2 . Multiple myeloma diagnose accord standard criterion either currently time initial diagnosis . The initial diagnosis must symptomatic MM , although relapse disease need symptomatic . 3 . Participants must measurable disease define least 1 follow 3 measurement base central laboratory data : Serum Mprotein : &gt; =1 g/dL ( &gt; = 10 g/L ) . Urine Mprotein : &gt; =200 mg/24 hour . Serum free light chain assay : involved free light chain level &gt; =10 mg/dL ( &gt; = 100 mg/L ) , provide serum free light chain ratio abnormal . 4 . Participants RRMM receive 1 3 prior therapy . This participant population include follow 3 category participant : Participants relapse therapy ( ) refractory previous therapy . Participants refractory line previous therapy ( ) ( ie , participant never respond therapy receive ) . Participants relapse least 1 line therapy AND additionally refractory least 1 line therapy . For purpose study , refractory MM define PD therapy PD within 60 day last dose give therapy . A line therapy define 1 cycle plan treatment program . This may consist 1 planned cycle singleagent therapy combination therapy , well sequence treatment administer planned manner . For example , plan treatment approach induction therapy follow autologous stem cell transplantation , follow maintenance consider 1 line therapy . Autologous allogenic transplant permit . 5 . Participants must meet follow clinical laboratory criterion : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; = 1,000/mm3 , hemoglobin &gt; = 8 g/dL platelet count &gt; = 75,000/mm3 . Platelet transfusion help participant meet eligibility criterion allow within 3 day prior screen . Total bilirubin = &lt; 1.5 x upper limit normal range ( ULN ) . Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) = &lt; 3 x ULN . Calculated creatinine clearance &gt; = 30 mL/min . 6 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 , 1 , 2 . 7 . Participants receive prior allogenic transplant must active graftversushost disease ( GVHD ) . 8 . Participants meet following condition : Female participant : Are postmenopausal least 24 month screen visit , OR Are surgically sterile , OR Females childbearing potential must : 1 . Have negative pregnancy test sensitivity least 25 mIU/mL within 10 14 day within 24 hour prior start Cycle 1 lenalidomide 2 . Agree practice true abstinence begin TWO reliable method birth control ( 1 highly effective method 1 additional effective method AT THE SAME TIME ) least 28 day start study treatment 90 day last dose study treatment . 3 . Agree ongoing pregnancy test 4 . Adhere guideline RevMate program Male participant , even surgically sterilize ( ie , status postvasectomy ) , must : Agree avoid sexual intercourse completely 90 day last dose study treatment . Agree practice true abstinence practice effective barrier contraception entire study treatment period 90 day last dose study treatment partner childbearing potential , even successful vasectomy , Adhere guideline RevMate program 9 . Thromboembolism prophylaxis require base publish standard institutional standard care . 10 . Voluntary write consent must give performance studyrelated procedure part standard medical care , understand consent may withdraw participant time without prejudice future medical care . 11 . Participant willing able adhere study visit schedule protocol requirement . 1 . Participants refractory lenalidomide proteasome inhibitorbased therapy line . Refractory disease define PD treatment PD within 60 day last dose give therapy . Participants progress disease 60 day last dose give therapy consider relapse eligible inclusion study . Participants refractory thalidomidebased therapy eligible . 2 . Female participant breast feed pregnant . 3 . Failure fully recover ( ie , = &lt; Grade 1 toxicity ) effect prior chemotherapy ( except hair loss ) regardless interval since last treatment . 4 . Major surgery within 14 day enrollment . 5 . Radiotherapy within 14 day enrollment . 6 . Central nervous system involvement . 7 . Infection require systemic antibiotic therapy serious infection within 14 day enrollment . 8 . Rash pruritus require systemic medication within 14 day enrollment . 9 . Diagnosis Waldenstrom 's macroglobulinemia , POEMS ( polyneuropathy , organomegaly , endocrinopathy , monoclonal gammopathy , skin change ) syndrome , plasma cell leukemia , primary amyloidosis , myelodysplastic syndrome , myeloproliferative syndrome . 10 . Evidence current uncontrolled cardiovascular condition , include uncontrolled hypertension , uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina , myocardial infarction within past 6 month enrollment . 11 .
