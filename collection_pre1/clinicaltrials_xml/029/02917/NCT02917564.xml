	<brief_summary>During glaucoma surgery , new opening create allows fluid drain eye , bypass clogged drainage channel malfunction patient glaucoma . In patient glaucoma surgery much fluid flow result pressure low . This may cause swell one layer back eye call choroid . The formation swelling , call choroidal effusion `` choroidal '' , often make eye pressure stay low , one result decrease vision . The treatment choroidal effusion try raise eye pressure somewhat allow swell subside . In clinical work , find injection anti-inflammatory drug call triamcinolone appear helpful speed healing . We plan compare two group patient choroidal effusion , one group get injection triamcinolone one get `` sham '' treatment nothing inject compare length time take choroidal effusion disappear . Both group receive standard treatment eye drop . We also assess outcome glaucoma surgery complication may occur . This research aim study new method improve outcome surgery glaucoma patient , treatment glaucoma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Glaucoma second commonest cause blindness society . The effective treatment currently involve lower intraocular pressure ( IOP ) medical , laser , surgical technique . Glaucoma surgery indicate IOP lower need despite maximal medical therapy appropriate laser treatment . The choroid pigment vascular structure locate sclera retinal pigment epithelium . Choroidal effusion aberrant collection fluid within suprachoroidal potential space . There two type choroidal effusion , serous hemorrhagic , depend type fluid accumulate suprachoroidal space . A serous choroidal effusion compose transudate fluid increase transmural pressure across capillary . Their development usually relatively painless . Hemorrhagic choroidal effusion suprachoroidal haemorrhage sudden usually painful accumulation blood suprachoroidal space . 4 Choroidal effusion cause low IOP pro-inflammatory condition . Causes concomitant low IOP inflammation include trauma eye surgery , especially glaucoma surgery . Inflammatory cause include scleritis . Modern glaucoma surgery minimize incidence postoperative hypotony resultant choroidal effusion still prevalent . 1 The prevalence choroidal effusion glaucoma surgery varies 10 15 % , average 13 % trabeculectomy ( standard technique glaucoma surgery ) . 5 A complication low-IOP-induced choroidal effusion hypotony maculopathy , cause permanent decline vision , especially resolve timely manner . 5 Treatment either medical surgical . Medical treatment include cessation systemic topical IOP lower agent add cycloplegic agent , topical steroid eventually systemic steroid . If treatment increase IOP reduce choroidal effusion , surgical management consider . Depending particular clinical circumstance patient , different surgical approach use , include revision trabeculectomy flap , anterior chamber reformation , surgical drainage effusion . As alternative systemic steroid , steroid triamcinolone acetonide ( Kenalogâ„¢ ) inject subtenons space . This treatment allow high local dose steroid , without expose patient systemic treatment . Not every patient require steroid injection , treatment reserve patient respond medical management day . There several study literature show benefit triamcinolone injection different inflammatory condition , uveitis treatment diabetic maculopaty cystoid macular edema . 6-9 Recently Shen et al . publish benefit subtenons triamcinolone acetonide management combination retinal detachment choroidal effusion . 2 However find study assess benefit triamcinolone subtenons injection choroidal effusion glaucoma surgery . In recent retrospective study perform chart review effect subtenons triamcinolone injection patient choroidal effusion glaucoma surgery compare group patient receive injection part management . We find recovery time injection group significantly short patient injection , 10.6 day versus 27.44 day . ( p=0.02 ) . The study show difference final intraocular pressure ( IOP ) , number medication visual acuity .</detailed_description>
