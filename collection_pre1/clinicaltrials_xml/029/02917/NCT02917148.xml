	<brief_summary>The goal research proposal identify miRNA expression profile biomarker diagnose predict acute graft versus host disease ( aGVHD ) patient undergo allogeneic transplantation . This biomarker , identify , need validation large cohort .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MicroRNAs Diagnostic Predictive Biomarkers Acute Graft Versus Host Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Human subject volunteer participate study request approximately 20 cc blood drawn ( 12 tablespoon ) several time interval . These time interval include prior condition regimen transplant , day transplantation , day +30 , +60 +100 transplantation . If give subject develops acute graft-versus-host disease , blood sample obtain time well . The amount blood sample collect 8 week period exceed 50 ml collection occur twice week . There pregnant woman child involve investigator study . All patient involve study undergo bone marrow transplant pregnancy screen do pre-transplant testing . This blood collect lavender top , EDTA tube ; plasma ( serum ) may collect store additional analysis .</detailed_description>
