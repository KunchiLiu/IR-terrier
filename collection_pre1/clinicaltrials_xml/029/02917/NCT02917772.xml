	<criteria>Signed Written Informed Consent Subjects must sign dated IRB/IEC approve write informed consent form accordance regulatory institutional guideline . This must obtain performance protocol relate procedure part normal subject care . Subjects must willing able comply schedule visit , treatment schedule , laboratory testing , requirement study . Target Population Histological confirmation RCC clearcell component . Advanced ( amenable curative surgery radiation therapy ) metastatic ( AJCC Stage IV ) RCC One ( antiangiogenic temsirolimus ) [ eligible 2nd line tier ] prior systemic therapy RCC [ eligible 1st line tier ] follow exception : One prior adjuvant neoadjuvant therapy completely resectable RCC therapy include agent target VEGF VEGF receptor well CTLA4 PD1/PDL1 immune checkpoint inhibitor , respectively , recurrence occur least 6 month last dose adjuvant neoadjuvant therapy . KPS least 70 % Measurable disease per RECIST v1.1 Tumor tissue ( FFPE archival recent acquisition ) must receive central vendor ( block unstained slide ) . ( Note : Fine Needle Aspiration [ FNA ] bone metastases sample acceptable submission ) . Patients intermediate poor risk category eligible study . To eligible intermediate poorrisk , least one follow prognostic factor per International Metastatic RCC Database Consortium ( IMDC ) criterion must present : KPS equal 70 % Less 1 year initial diagnosis RCC ( eg , nephrectomy first diagnostic biopsy ) registration ( 1st line ) start firstline target therapy ( 2nd line ) , respectively Hemoglobin less low limit normal ( LLN ) Corrected calcium concentration great upper limit normal ( ULN ) Absolute neutrophil count great ULN Platelet count great ULN If none factor present , subject eligible ( favorablerisk ) . Age Reproductive Status Males Females , â‰¥ 18 year age Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must negative serum urine pregnancy test ( minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L equivalent unit HCG ) within 24 hour prior start study drug . Women must breastfeed Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must agree follow instruction method ( ) contraception period 30 day ( duration ovulatory cycle ) plus time required investigational drug undergo five halflives . The terminal half live nivolumab ipilimumab 25 day 18 day , respectively . WOCBP use adequate method avoid pregnancy 23 week ( 30 day plus time require nivolumab undergo five halflives ) last dose investigational drug . Males sexually active WOCBP must agree follow instruction method ( ) contraception period 90 day ( duration sperm turnover ) plus time required investigational drug undergo five halflives . The terminal half live nivolumab ipilimumab 25 day 18 day , respectively . Males receive nivolumab combine ipilimumab sexually active WOCBP must continue contraception 31 week ( 90 day plus time require nivolumab undergo five halflives ) last dose investigational drug . Azoospermic male WOCBP continuously heterosexually active exempt contraceptive requirement . However , WOCBP must still undergo pregnancy test described section . Target Disease Exceptions Any history current CNS metastasis . Baseline image brain MRI ( prefer ) CT scan require within 28 day prior registration . Medical History Concurrent Diseases Prior systemic treatment one follow drug : mTOR , VEGF VEGF receptor target therapy ( include , limited , temsirolimus , everolimus , sunitinib , pazopanib , axitinib , tivozanib , bevacizumab ) . Prior treatment antiPD1 , antiPDL1 , antiPDL2 , antiCD137 , antiCTLA4 antibody , antibody drug specifically target Tcell costimulation checkpoint pathway . Any active recent history know suspect autoimmune disease recent history syndrome require systemic corticosteroid ( &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent ) immunosuppressive medication except syndrome would expect recur absence external trigger . Subjects vitiligo type I diabetes mellitus residual hypothyroidism due autoimmune thyroiditis require hormone replacement permit enroll . Any condition require systemic treatment corticosteroid ( &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent ) immunosuppressive medication within 14 day prior first dose study drug . Inhaled steroid adrenal replacement steroid dose &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent permit absence active autoimmune disease . Prior malignancy active within previous 3 year except locally curable cancer apparently cure , basal squamous cell skin cancer , superficial bladder cancer , carcinoma situ prostate , cervix , breast . Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection know acquire immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . Any positive test hepatitis B hepatitis C virus indicate acute chronic infection . Known medical condition ( eg , condition associate diarrhea acute diverticulitis ) , investigator 's opinion , would increase risk associate study participation study drug administration interfere interpretation safety result . Major surgery ( eg , nephrectomy ) less 28 day prior first dose study drug . Anticancer therapy le 28 day prior first dose study drug palliative , focal radiation therapy le 14 day prior first dose study drug . Presence toxicity attribute prior anticancer therapy , alopecia , resolve Grade 1 ( NCI CTCAE v4 ) baseline administration study drug . Physical Laboratory Test Findings Any follow laboratory test finding : WBC &lt; 2,000/mm3 Neutrophils &lt; 1,500/mm3 Platelets &lt; 100,000/mm3 AST ALT &gt; 3 x ULN ( &gt; 5 x ULN liver metastasis present ) Total Bilirubin &gt; 1.5 x ULN ( except subject Gilbert Syndrome , total bilirubin &lt; 3.0 mg/dL ) Serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) creatinine clearance &lt; 40 mL/min ( measure calculate CockroftGault formula ) Allergies Adverse Drug Reaction History severe hypersensitivity reaction monoclonal antibody constituent product . Other Exclusion Criteria Patients unable consent understand nature , significance implication clinical trial therefore form rational intention light fact . Patient incarcerate involuntarily institutionalize court order authority .</criteria>
