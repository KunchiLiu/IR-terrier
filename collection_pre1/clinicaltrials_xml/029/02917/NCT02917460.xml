	<detailed_description>RCI collect biological sample ( blood ) , derive genomic sequence ( DNA RNA ) , clinical feature Biorepository standardize resource future research study . The purpose Genomics Institute Biorepository provide consent sample data basic clinical research relate genomic cause treatment childhood disease , , future , reference ( Quality Control ) data improve ability make clinical diagnosis clinical decision . A diverse Biorepository biological sample clinical data essential allow study undertake broad detailed comparison . In particular , large Biorepository allow Institute-affiliated researcher identify new cause diseases treatment response many understudied ethnic racial group Rady Children 's Hospital , San Diego ( RCHSD ) serve . Specifically , Biorepository , via subsequent individual research protocol , enable research improve rate clinical diagnosis enrol subject subsequently affect patient , improve test capability offer patient , enhance understanding mechanisms disease treatment response , improve clinical management disease . The Biorepository enroll affect unaffected individual family member , affect unaffected tissue , purpose analysis comparison order identify underlying cause disease treatment affect sample . Samples data store indefinitely share approve researcher understand genomic component pediatric disease . In addition , Biorepository provide mechanism make diagnosis genetic disease . That , genomic sequence derive biological sample , immediately analyze . If genetic disease identify appear explain affected child 's clinical feature , result confirm manner compliant Clinical Laboratory Improvements Act ( CLIA ) College American Pathologist ( CAP ) recommendation , place electronic health record ( EHR ) . Samples confirm CLIA CAP method identify retained future confirmatory investigation . Specific Aims 1 . To collect biological sample associate clinical data ( Phenome ) . 2 . To create , analyze store genomic data biological sample . Genomic data include genome ( DNA ) sequence , RNA sequence , and/or related 'omic data ( include pharmacogenomics , transcriptomics , epigenetics , microbiome ) . Some genomic data whole genome sequence . For sample genomic data panel specific gene exon gene ( `` Exome '' ) . 3 . To investigate improve genomics technology software enhance understand test ability relate childhood disease treatment response . 4 . To make specimen data available qualified researcher collaborator understand childhood disease treatment response . 5 . To collect correlate genomic data wide variety population clinical presentation . 6 . To provide sample data collection uniform consent , method acquisition , storage genome-based research study subsequent IRB approval . 7 . To analyze report clinically-confirmed genomic diagnosis treatment guidance use new research technology . 8 . To identify study novel gene disease process . The investigator plan enroll 3000 subject per year . Following informed consent , study team collect family history blood sample . The investigator collect clinical information medical record time enrollment longitudinally assess change subject 's medical condition well collect new symptom . The study team scavenge tissue biological material obtain clinical procedure indicate clinical presentation future research testing .</detailed_description>
