	<brief_summary>The investigator hypothesise carnosine supplementation improve : 1. glycaemic control 2. cardiovascular risk factor 3. cognitive outcome patient impair glucose tolerance type 2 diabetes , modulate reduction chronic low grade inflammation , oxidative stress circulate advance glycation end product level . 3 . Aims To determine potential carnosine supplementation 14 week improve glycaemic control type 2 diabetes , reduce risk factor cardiovascular disease improve cognitive function well identify metabolic pathway involve , specifically : 1 . Improving glycaemic control ( HBA1c , fast 2 hour glucose glucose area curve oral glucose tolerance test ) 2 . Reducing cardiovascular risk factor ( lipid ; arterial ( aortic ) stiffness ; central blood pressure ( cBP ) ; endothelial function ) . 3 . Improve cognitive function ( global cognitive score form composite 4 cognitive test ) 4 . Decrease chronic low grade inflammation , oxidative stress , advance glycation end product , advance lipoxidation end product , increase detoxification reactive carbonyl specie ( RCSs ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Type 2 diabetes major public health problem worldwide . Obesity markedly increase risk type 2 diabetes ( DM2 ) , affect every second obese person . With 60 % adult Australians overweight obese 25 % Australians age 25 year prediabetes diabetes , quality-of-life cost impact inescapable . In Australia , direct healthcare cost DM2 currently estimate $ 1.1 billion annually , prospect double 2025 . Obesity DM2 dramatically increase risk cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) ~80 % individual obesity DM2 develop CVD . The annual healthcare cost CVD Australia amount $ 7.7 billion ; total aggregated cost , include loss income , much high . Treating DM2 CVD expensive often unsatisfactory . Weight loss exercise mainstay prevention therapy difficult costly achieve large scale ; hence DM2 epidemic continue unabated . Therefore , intervention low cost easy implement population level urgently require . Neurodegenerative disease often occur people DM2 , DM2 turn associate increased risk cognitive decline . Neurodegenerative disease Alzheimer 's disease also associate metabolic impairment . They share many common pathogenic feature DM2 insulin resistance , chronic low-grade inflammation , vascular disease , oxidative stress accumulation advance glycation endproducts ( AGEs ) . Progression diseases years-decades also worsen sedentary life-style . Therefore surprisingly , regular physical activity beneficial patient , likely due improvement neurological , motor cardiometabolic profile . However , difficult costly achieve large scale , thus , safe low-cost strategy need . Type 2 diabetes associate increased amount ectopic fat depot muscle include intramyocellular lipid ( IMCL ) , adipocytes locate muscle group ( inter-muscular ) also muscle fascicle ( intramuscular ) . Both IMCL intra- inter-muscular adipose tissue ( IMAT ) may deleteriously effect muscle metabolism insulin sensitivity increase local secretion pro-inflammatory adipokines , inter-muscular fat may additionally impair insulin action reduction blood flow muscle . Could carnosine strategy ? Strong molecular animal data ( &gt; 2000 paper ) suggest great potential , relevant property . Carnosine , present several tissue include muscle brain , easily cross blood-brain barrier , extensive animal data show carnosine chelating property modulate glucose metabolism , advanced glycation , pro-inflammatory pro-oxidative state , well motor function neurotransmission . A promising use may derive effect cardiometabolic health neuroprotection . Current research , confine animal study , support carnosine supple¬ment¬ation prevent treat obesity , DM2 , CVD , neurodegenerative disease - virtue anti-inflammatory , antioxidative , anti-glycating chelating effect . Our team 's novel pilot study provide first human cross-sectional interventional metabolic data , demonstrate relationship among carnosine , obesity , insulin resistance , dyslipidaemia . Previous clinical trial also show supplementation carnosine 2-3 month improve cognitive performance healthy individual patient neurodegenerative disease . However , none show effect patient type 2 diabetes explored effect change cardiometabolic outcome cognitive function . Apart excellent side-effect profile , carnosine cheap safe ( over-the-counter dietary supplement ) , make prima facie ideal widespread , low cost use . Robust human research urgently need test therapeutic potential carnosine improve cardiometabolic profile cognitive function , study mechanism involve .</detailed_description>
