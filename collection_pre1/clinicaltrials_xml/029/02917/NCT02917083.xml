	<brief_summary>The subject type lymph gland cancer call Lymphoma . The body different way fight infection disease . No single way seem perfect fight cancer . This research study combine two different way fight disease : antibody T cell . T cell , also call T lymphocyte , special infection-fighting blood cell kill cell , include tumor cell cell infected germ . Both antibody T cell use treat patient cancer ; show promise , strong enough cure patient . Investigators hope work well together . Investigators find previous research put new gene T cell make recognize cancer cell kill . They want test whether multiple dos genetically modify T cell effective kill cancer cell . The gene put T cell make antibody call anti-CD30 . This antibody stick lymphoma cell substance outside cell call CD30 . Anti-CD30 antibody use treat people lymphoma , strong enough cure patient . For study , anti-CD30 antibody change instead float free blood join T cell . When antibody join T cell way call chimeric receptor . These CD30 chimeric receptor-activated T cell ( CD30.CAR T cell ) seem kill tumor , n't last long chance fight cancer unknown . Several study suggest infuse T cell need room able multiply grow accomplish function , may happen many T cell circulation . Because , doctor may use chemotherapy drug decrease level circulate T cell prior CD30.CAR T cell infusion . This call `` lymphodepletion '' . CD30.CAR T cell previously study lymphoma patient . What new study multiple dos CAR T cell administer , lymphodepletion chemotherapy administer patient post autologous transplant hope result durable anti-tumor effect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To prepare CD30.CAR T cell , research staff take blood subject . This would draw 2 ( two ) separate blood collection . Alternatively , subject 's blood count low , staff may collect cell need prepare T cell pheresis procedure . This procedure involve place needle arm , collect cell 3 6 hour subject require lie relatively still . After T cell collect , activate stimulating antibody infect retroviral vector ( special virus carry new gene cell ) contain new gene call anti-CD30 make antibody lymphoma cell . The trained cell call CD30.CAR T cell . Then , cell test make sure kill lymphoma cell express CD30 antigen normal cell . The cell generate frozen store give back subject . This dose escalation study . This mean beginning , patient start low dos ( 1 3 different level ) CD30.CAR T Cells . Once dose schedule prove safe , next group patient start high dose . This process continue 3 dose level study . If side effect severe , dose lower T cell infusion stop . The risk harm discomfort study treatment may bear relationship dose level . The potential direct benefit , , may also vary dose level . Subjects give two injection CD30.CAR T cell . The first injection Day 0 second injection give two week later Day 14 . The CD30.CAR T cell inject vein IV line assign dose . The injection take 1-10 minute . If subject post autologous transplant receive treatment cyclophosphamide fludarabine ( chemotherapy drug ) CD30.CAR T cell . These drug decrease number patient 's T cell CD30.CAR T cell infuse . Although investigator expect effect tumor dose patient receive , drug part many regimen use treat lymphoma leukemia . In first second T cell infusion 6 week last infusion , investigator ask subject receive anti-cancer treatment radiation therapy chemotherapy . If receive therapy in-between first second infusion T cell , take treatment able receive second infusion T cell . To learn way CD30.CAR T cell work long last body , extra blood drawn . If subject stable disease ( lymphoma grow ) reduction size his/her lymphoma image study 2nd T-cell infusion s/he negative result HAMA test , subject receive six additional dos T cell 8 12 week interval desire . Because nature study , subject follow 15 year treatment .</detailed_description>
