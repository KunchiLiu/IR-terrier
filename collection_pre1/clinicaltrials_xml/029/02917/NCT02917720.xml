	<brief_summary>The main goal study assessment duration major molecular response ( MMR ) better 12 36 month stop tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) therapy second time patient least three year prior TKI treatment comprise least two year nilotinib treatment within trial maintain stable MR4 ( BCR-ABL ratio &lt; 0,01 % international Scale ( IS ) least one year MR4.5 ( BCR-ABL ratio &lt; 0,0032 % IS ) least 6 month : - fail first stop EURO-SKI study ( standardized criterion ) - fail first stop outside EURO-SKI study would fulfil eligible criterion stop accord EURO-SKI rule - fail first stop outside EURO-SKI study without fulfil EURO-SKI rule</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>2nd TKI-stop After 2 Years Nilotinib Pre-treatment Patients With First Unsuccessful Treatment Discontinuation CML</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The proposal re-treat patient minimum two year nilotinib 2x300 mg/d result total least three year TKI treatment show recurrent disease unsuccessful first stop TKI treatment outside EURO-SKI study . If MR4 good re-achieved maintain least one year MR4.5 good re-achieved maintain least 6 month , patient eligible second stop attempt within study . For MR4 , three consecutive PCRs MR4 deeper measure within one year MR4.5 , two PCRs 6 month demonstrate MR4.5 . Patients exhibit hematological relapse first stop attempt eligible second stop attempt within study . After inclusion , 3 monthly monitoring perform nilotinib treatment within trial . Patients fulfil criterion mention enter screen phase . After verification MR4.5 , TKI treatment stop patient follow manner described EURO-SKI ( monthly PCRs 6 month , 6-weekly PCRs 7-12 month stop , thereafter 3-monthly ) . If MMR lose ( BCR-ABL &gt; 0.1 % ( IS ) ) , TKI treatment restart ; TKI ( nilotinib ) recommend . It assume failure first stop switch treatment 2GTKI may increase chance stop second time [ Legros et al . Blood 2012 ; Rea et al . Blood 2014 ] It expect rate successful second stop 12 36 month 25 % .</detailed_description>
