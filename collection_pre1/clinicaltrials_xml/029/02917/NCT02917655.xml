	<brief_summary>BACKGROUND : Osteoarthritis ( OA ) , particularly knee osteoarthritis ( KOA ) disorder greatly impair quality life patient incidence increase longevity , obesity lower socioeconomic educational level . It expect 40 % people 60 symptomatic OA knee hip . The core treatment OA education , weight loss increase physical activity . We create educational program improve function patient give five-times-sit-to- stand test ( FTSST ) . However , weight loss , important foundation clinical treatment , effective ( 2 point BMI ) 10 % program participant . For great effectiveness weight loss adherence physical activity , prepared intensive program intensive nutritional care , psychological , physical therapy physical trainer compare exist program educator . OBJECTIVE : To compare educational program isolate educational program associate nutritional consultation , group therapy session progress physiotherapy session session physical educator patient KOA comorbidities ( metabolic syndrome ) . METHODS : Ninety patient OAJ co-morbidities ( Two : overweight obesity , hyperglycemia , dyslipidemia , hyperuricemia , high blood pressure ) divide two group : study ( S ) control ( C ) . Both group attend two-day multi-professional class OA two month interval . But study group also make three group consultation nutrition , 1 extra session group therapy psychology team 7 exercise session group physical therapy subsequently 7 session physical educator . The group evaluate weight , height ( calculate BMI ) , waist-hip ratio , percentage body fat , consumption daily medication , WOMAC , Lequesne , IPAQ , Tampa Scale Kinesiophobia ( TSK ) , test sit rise , timed-up- and-go ( TUG ) six minute test .
