	<brief_summary>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) chronic lung disease primarily cause smoking . Pulmonary rehabilitation ( PR ) evidence-based , interdisciplinary , comprehensive intervention COPD patient include patient assessment , exercise training , self-management education promote behavior change . PR show effective strategy improve clinical health outcome , consider standard care intervention individual COPD remain symptomatic despite optimal drug therapy . Despite considerable evidence support effectiveness PR enhance clinical outcome , unclear PR influence behavior promote COPD management ( i.e. , physical activity , medication adherence , self-managing exacerbation ) . In collaboration local clinical staff well national colleague Canadian Thoracic Society , new national pulmonary rehabilitation program co-developed designed increase physical activity , medication adherence , skill help manage chronic lung disease . The new program aim increase people 's confidence autonomy perform disease-management behavior , design effective increase physical activity , medication adherence , disease management skills previous pulmonary rehabilitation program . The program design deliver within different setting practice , include traditional PR center , satellite site ( i.e. , sit remote major institution ) , use Tele-health web-based resource , primary care medical center . The effectiveness new Standardized Canadian PR program assess relative traditional PR program . This trial important step towards establish necessary evidence enable u work dissemination implementation new standardized PR program across country .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The CaNadian Standardized Pulmonary Rehabilitation Efficacy Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase 1 : The implementation new Canadian Standardized PR program `` Real life project '' do evaluate exist pulmonary rehabilitation program four site ( G.F. MacDonald Centre Lung Health , Mount Sinai Hospital , Montreal Chest Institute West Park Health Care Centre ) . This serve pilot test new pulmonary rehabilitation program identify problem , adapt solution improve program , content delivery . Phase 2 : A randomized parallel-controlled trial ( RPCT ) also implement one site G.F. MacDonald Centre Lung Health . Entire PR class block randomize accord random number table receive usual care ( traditional PR ) new Canadian Standardized PR program . Several rural Tele-health site participate PR via G.F. MacDonald Centre Lung Health also include randomize well . Both group expose exercise training component . The two group expose different education component ( describe detail elsewhere ) . The effectiveness new Canadian Standardized PR program ( experimental group ) evaluate relative Traditional PR program ( active comparator group ) term clinical , behavioural , psychological outcome . Primary Objective : To determine new Canadian Standardized PR program deliver in-person satellite sit support Tele-health improves maintain specific self-management behavior rehabilitation traditional PR program . Primary Outcome : Physical activity ( steps-per day measure FitbitÂ® ) Secondary Outcomes : ) Medication adherence ( measure pharmacy refill ) ; ii ) exacerbation recognition prompt decision-making ( diary &amp; phone call ) . Secondary Objectives : To determine new Canadian Standardized PR program improve predispose factor behavior change ( knowledge , self-determination theory construct motivation , self-efficacy ) follow rehabilitation Traditional PR program variation accord method delivering program , i.e. , via Tele-health technology v person . To determine new Canadian Standardized PR program result great improvement clinical outcome ( exercise capacity , health status ) health service use ( hospital admission ) follow completion rehabilitation compare Traditional PR program . Statistical Methods : Analysis determine potential benefit new Canadian Standardized PR program : Repeated measure ANOVAS conduct evaluate change PR behavioral outcome ( physical activity , medication adherence , exacerbation adherence ) , predispose behavior change outcome ( self-efficacy , knowledge , self-determination theory construct ) , clinical outcome ( quality life , exercise tolerance ) Traditional PR group compare new Canadian Standardized PR group . Patients ' adherence action plan regular medication , self-efficacy , symptoms/health : After carefully examine data distribution ( transform warrant ) , investigator first calculate proportion ( 95 % CI ) patient initiate action plan , include seek treatment increase medication appropriate within 48 hour symptom onset . In case multiple exacerbation , first instance use . A separate analysis do multiple exacerbation , account patient variable . The investigator explore secondary objective evaluate change time patient adherence medication , self-efficacy , symptom , health relate quality life . Regression analysis use explore change outcomes control effect potential covariates confounders baseline respiratory status , age , sex , disease severity , comorbidities smoke status . The investigator calculate mean proportion acceptability provider resource use . Sample Size Determination : The investigator anticipate sample 200 COPD patient ( 100 group ) , 40 patient participate rural site Tele-health . Sample size calculation base evaluate change primary outcome - physical activity measure step per day - Traditional PR new Canadian Standardized PR group . A literature search indicate Traditional PR seem small negligible effect COPD patient ' physical activity level . Given new Canadian Standardized program design specifically target predispose factor behavior change , investigator anticipate medium effect size increase physical activity compare usual care program . In order detect medium effect size , power = .80 , alpha = .05 , investigator recruit 100 COPD patient per group ( G*Power 3 ) . Data Handling Record Keeping : Data collect stored central Redcap database . Patients unique study code number , unique identifier include within Redcap database .</detailed_description>
