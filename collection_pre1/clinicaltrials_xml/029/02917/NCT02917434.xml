	<brief_title>Effects Weight-loss Treatment Obese Patients With Psoriatic Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Psoriasis common skin disease affect around 2-3 % population Sweden . Approximately 20-30 % individual psoriasis develop psoriatic arthritis ( PsA ) . PsA mainly engage musculoskeletal apparatus cause inflammation joint , tendon ligament , disease also increase risk develop anterior uveitis inflammatory bowel disease , especially Crohn 's disease . Both psoriasis PsA strongly associate obesity metabolic syndrome ( Mets ) . Observational study report frequency obesity ( body mass index ; BMI≥30 kg/m2 ) 45 % MetS 30-45 % PsA patient . Earlier study show obesity increase risk develop psoriasis PsA obesity associate increased disease activity , poor treatment response low chance achieve minimal disease activity . Although association PsA obesity well know , small number interventional study assess effect weight loss disease activity PsA . Patients PsA also increase risk cardiovascular disease . [ 12 , 13 ] Chronic inflammation , accelerate atherosclerotic process , combination high prevalence cardiovascular risk factor among PsA patient believe contribute increase risk . Obesity cause low grade systemic inflammation via production pro-inflammatory mediator white adipose tissue , adipokines cytokine ( e.g . tumour necrosis factor-α interleukin-6 ) , also involved pathogenic process PsA . Obesity-related inflammation could thus act synergistically autoimmune inflammation development maintenance disease psoriasis PsA . Weight-loss treatment Low Energy liquid Diet ( LED ) effective approve method clinical use Sweden . In severe obesity , BMI 35 kg/m2 , strict energy restriction need optimal weight-loss . The LED give daily intake 880 calorie together recommend dos vitamin mineral . During initial period 12 week patient consume LED . The weight-loss intake 1-2 kilogram per week . After strict period food successively reintroduce period 18 week . The treatment give within framework structured program include support medical follow-up team doctor , nurse dietician . AIMS The aim study - To determine effect weight loss treatment disease activity , function , quality life marker metabolic syndrome patient psoriatic arthritis - To study specific effect immune system negative energy balance strict energy restriction period prospectively , two year follow-up - To investigate difference body-composition , marker Mets adipokines patient PsA obesity control obesity weight loss treatment . PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients PsA obesity register Rheumatology clinic Sahlgrenska University hospital hospital Alingsås Borås invite participate . The result PsA patient compare control patient obesity ( PsA psoriasis ) match age , sex BMI undergo weight loss treatment LED . Disease activity , physical function quality life assess physical examination ( include anthropometric measure , joint , tendon , back mobility skin ) validate questionnaire baseline ( start weight-loss treatment ) , 3 month , 6 month , 12 month 24 month . Blood sample collect appointment . Body-composition measure baseline 12 month . Muscle strengths physical function measure baseline , 6 month 12 month physical activity assess questionnaire accelerometer . Informed write consent obtain patient control . The study approve local regional ethic committee Gothenburg carry accordance Helsinki Declaration .</detailed_description>
