	<brief_summary>The burden bloodstream infection large increase time . Antibiotic overuse continue drive increase rate antimicrobial-resistant pathogen across Canada . However , prospective audit reveal 30-50 % antibiotic utilization unnecessary inappropriate . If short duration therapy effective long duration therapy infection , antimicrobial consumption would decrease . A pilot trial ( approve Sunnybrook Research Ethics Board ) , underway critically ill patient 17 Canadian ICUs . Investigators successfully demonstrate feasibility respect protocol adherence recruitment rate ICU . Investigators aim conduct similar pilot RCT among non-ICU patient admit hospital ward bloodstream infection determine feasibility protocol adherence trial protocol .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BALANCE Wards : A Pilot RCT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bloodstream infection common serious problem , associate increased morbidity mortality . At time , antibiotic overuse also common serious problem , 30-50 % antibiotic use unnecessary inappropriate , result avoidable drug side effect kidney failure , Clostridium difficile infection , increased cost , spiral antibiotic resistance rate . The great contributor antibiotic overuse excessive duration treatment . Extensive research demonstrate short duration antibiotic treatment ( less equal 7 day ) effective long duration treatment variety infectious disease , question directly study set bloodstream infection . Our team 's systematic review medical literature , national survey Canadian infectious disease critical care physician , multicentre retrospective study support need randomize controlled trial comparing shorter ( 7 day ) versus longer ( 14 day ) antibiotic therapy bloodstream infection . Prior perform main trial , pilot RCT critically ill patient near-completion . In order increase generalizability non-critically ill patient , Investigators want conduct similar pilot RCT non-critically ill patient ( BALANCE Wards ) establish feasibility research design , optimize definitive trial . Investigators conduct randomize concealed allocation trial short duration ( 7 day ) versus long duration ( 14 day ) antibiotic treatment patient bloodstream infection across non-ICU hospital ward Sunnybrook Hospital ( BALANCE Wards ) . Our ongoing BALANCE pilot RCT ICU approve Sunnybrook REB ( PIN : 187-2014 ) . The BALANCE Wards pilot trial use protocol , informed consent form case report form approve Sunnybrook REB minimal change make ward specific . If investigator able achieve primary outcome trial Sunnybrook hospital , main BALANCE trial potentially involve enrolment non-ICU patient ( subset ) participate site . If eligibility criterion study procedure substantially unchanged , result pilot BALANCE RCTs roll dataset main BALANCE RCT .</detailed_description>
