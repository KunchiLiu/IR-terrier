	<brief_title>Assessing Health Outcomes Low-income Diabetics Who Receive Monthly Boxes Healthy Food Clinic</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It hypothesize provide healthy food may stabilize unhealthy eat pattern diabetic HbA1c measurement significantly improve . The UCSD Student-Run Free Clinic Project ( SRFCP ) offer box nutritious food monthly along brief nutrition class diabetic patient continue otherwise usual care . The UCSD SRFCP partner large food bank , Feeding America San Diego , provide monthly food box healthy food along education eat healthy budget . Food insecurity negatively impact health outcome diabetic patient ; therefore enhance food security nutritious food well provide education cultivate healthy eating habit could cost-effective way improve health outcome diabetic , necessitate use human subject study . Blood pressure , weight , LDL cholesterol secondary outcome measure along survey measure diabetes distress , depression , dietary quality assessment , medication adherence , hypoglycemia , food security . Diabetics enroll study randomly assign initial 3-month period either immediate intervention ( food box education ) wait list control group . The intervention involve receive box nutritious food month along brief education provide food pantry staff , addition usual medical care . In measure clinical outcome , study deviate routine care . As part routine care screening , UCSD SRFCP patient receive six-item 'Short Form ' USDA Food Security Survey Module assess food security upon arrival wait area . This survey self-administered orally administer depend patient preference . Regardless food security status , everyone offer referral local food bank referral Cal-Fresh ( Food Stamps ) application eligible . All patient receive care UCSD SRFCP sit diagnosis diabetes , regardless food security status , offer resource addition inform study . The investigator track health outcome routine clinical visit query electronic health record patient chose participate study . Participants also ask complete survey baseline , 3 month , 6 month , 9 month ( wait list group ) . Those interested study speak study coordinator provide detailed discussion study . Once study fully explain ample time give patient make well-informed decision , inform consent obtain private room space study coordinator fluent patient 's preferred language ( English Spanish ) capable answer question study . The informed consent form provide English Spanish . It make clear patient obligation participate refusal participate way influence routine care receive UCSD SRFCP . If patient choose participate study , sign informed consent , patient complete 'Pre Survey , ' include measure diabetes distress , medication adherence , depression , dietary assessment , hypoglycemia . This available English Spanish , also self-administered orally administer depend patient preference . A wait list study design allow comparison immediate intervention arm wait list intervention arm isolate diabetes food box variable responsible patient improvement , still allow patient interested receive nutritious food box site free charge . After patient enrollment completion 'Pre Survey ' , participant randomize either immediate intervention arm , receive food nutrition education within month , next available monthly food distribution nutrition education session , enrol delay intervention arm begin food distribution nutrition class 3 month later . The UCSD SRFCP diabetic patient ' routine appointment typically schedule every three month would next schedule routine appointment . Realistically patient visit fall exactly 90 day later , visit data lab result near baseline , 3 month , 6 month , 9 month time frame include assess outcome study . To determine sample size , examine 3-month data previous UCSD clinical trial conduct Dr. Cheryl Rock subject type 2 diabetes ( Rock et al . Diabetes Care 2014 ; 37:1573 ) . Assuming mean ( SD ) HbA1c % reduction baseline 0.68 ( 1.02 ) % immediate intervention , 0.0 ( 0.88 ) % wait list control group , 97 % power dropout/nonadherence rate 40 % see group difference 3 month assign 100 patient immediate intervention 100 wait list control patient total 200 patient study . Analysis examine longitudinal change 3 month HbA1c % ( primary outcome variable ) secondary outcome variable ( e.g. , weight ) , extract medical record , allow 45-day window 3-month time point . Statistical analysis conduct use SPSS . Any miss data impute primary analysis intent treat . The investigator use t-tests Ï‡2 analysis assess between-group baseline difference . Baseline variables differ arm control subsequent analysis . Outcomes transform need well approximate Gaussian distribution analyze non-parametrically . Analyses evaluate intervention effect conduct 2-sided 5 % significance level . The investigator perform 2-sample t-tests repeat measure analyse use linear mixed model examine between-group difference pair t-tests examine within-subject change . Likelihood ratio test use assess significance model term ; covariates deem imbalanced across randomization arm control model . Participants immediate waitlist arm study ultimately receive food duration time ( 6 month ) . There approximately 200 patient diabetes , predominantly Latinos , receive care UCSD SRFCP investigator want ensure patient diabetes receive medical care SRFCP could enter study receive additional food resource onsite . The investigator commitment Feeding America San Diego food 200 patient duration study . The initial enrollment period estimate 3-6 month . Participants receive cart facilitate carry home box food . Brief educational session lead food pantry staff also utilized empower patient continue make inform decision health nutrition study end . These session lead bilingual person , fluent Spanish English . Example recipes nutritional pamphlet also provide diabetes box . The investigator would like participant eat food provide , although understood may also use immediate family member eat meal participant . Food insecurity measure routinely household level , therefore appropriate try raise household food insecurity part study . The 'Post Survey ' also administer 3 month , 6 month , ( waitlisted group ) 9 month educational session . The 'Post survey ' consists question 'Pre Survey ' plus question initial USDA Food Security screening . All participant assign unique study identification number order de-identify patient ' medical information . The de-identified dataset enter ishare , UCSD password-secure website utilized SRFCP , REDCap , secure website research tool manage survey database . Permission view folder contain de-identified database limit directly involve study . This de-identified dataset subject statistical analysis without potential link make back patient 's medical record private health information . Data analysis interpretation de-identified data . Finally , plan assist participant continue eat food like provide study , barrier participant face fiscal knowledge-based . First , Feeding America San Diego agree continue provide healthful diabetes food box conclusion study interested participant . Second , education include study design around empower participant continue make healthy food choice budget . It hop , exposure budget-friendly healthy food , participant continue make healthy affordable food choice grocery shopping . Third , begin project , objective enroll participant study also expose UCSD Student-run Free Clinic Project ( SRFCP ) patient available resource , facilitation Food Stamps ( Cal-Fresh ) enrollment well local food bank distribution patient ' neighborhood . Feeding America San Diego , example , 100 food bank sit throughout San Diego . Therefore , food resource persist study finish , hopefully leave participant last nutrition education well connection Cal-Fresh food bank . Making successful transition emphasis research team throughout study .</detailed_description>
