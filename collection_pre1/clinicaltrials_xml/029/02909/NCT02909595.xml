	<brief_summary>Endoscopic bile duct stone ( BDS ) removal well-established treatment ; however , preference basket balloon catheter extraction operator-dependent It report complete endoscopic treatment single catheter likely choose balloon catheter basket catheter extraction BDSs≤10mm . However , study compare two catheter type patient periampullary diverticulum perform , strong basis recommend balloon catheter first-line stone removal device . The investigator therefore conduct multicenter prospective randomize trial compare catheter performance patient periampullary diverticulum .</brief_summary>
