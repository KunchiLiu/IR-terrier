	<brief_summary>The best mode analgesia delivery hepatectomy currently unknown . Many institution routinely use continuous epidural analgesia ( CEA ) pain control patient population . A functioning CEA provide adequate analgesia , associate high failure rate ( 20-30 % ) sometimes significant hemodynamic disturbance ( hypotension ) require increase amount intravenous fluid blood product maintain homeostasis . Furthermore , safety subject debate liver resection patient due elevate risk epidural hematoma serious neurological consequence . These limitation highlight need explore option analgesic control hepatectomy , paravertebral block ( PVB ) . PVB show provide similar analgesia low incidence pulmonary complication , side effect ( pruritis , urinary retention , nausea vomiting , hypotension ) , failure rate ( 6.1 % ) compare CEA thoracic surgery , therefore suggest safer alternative hepatectomy patient . Despite , study compare efficacy CEA PVB analgesic technique hepatectomy .

	<detailed_description>The best mode analgesia delivery hepatectomy currently unknown . Many institution routinely use continuous epidural analgesia ( CEA ) pain control hepatectomy patient . However , safety subject debate . Paravertebral block ( PVB ) suggest safe alternative patient population . Despite , study compare efficacy CEA PVB analgesic technique hepatectomy . Although CEA provide high quality analgesia , reduce cardiovascular respiratory complication incidence postoperative thromboembolic event , associate hypotension complication epidural hematoma , epidural abscess , spinal cord injury , serious concern hepatectomy patient . Furthermore , patient give CEA likely need blood transfusion , transfuse patient significantly high mortality rate , complication related infection , hospital length stay . PVB less popular technique involve inject local anesthetic ( LA ) paravertebral space . This technique successfully use pain relief several surgical procedure , include ablation hepatic tumour hepatectomy . Although CEA PVB never compare hepatectomy patient , compare thoracotomy patient ; patient population , PVB CEA provide similar level pain control , CEA associate complication side effect hypotension , nausea , vomit , urinary retention , PVB associate good pulmonary function . Both CEA PVB reasonably effective post-hepatectomy analgesia compare placebo , strengths weakness . The gold standard CEA provide excellent analgesia expense intense hypotension , significant failure rate ( 20-30 % ) , high risk epidural hematoma serious neurological consequence . These limitation highlight need explore option analgesic control hepatectomy PVB . Therefore , investigator propose randomize controlled trial compare analgesic efficacy , hemodynamic change , side effect CEA PVB patient undergo elective hepatectomy right subcostal incision . Since CEA currently gold standard analgesia hepatectomy , investigator propose non-inferiority trial determine whether PVB produce similar analgesic profile CEA hepatectomy patient , associate few adverse side effect . This randomize , control , pilot study . It consist two group participant undergo hepatectomy : receiving CEA , receive PVB analgesic control . CEA PVB protocol follow usual standard care Kingston General Hospital ( KGH ) . Participants CEA group receive bupivacaine hydromorphone infusion induction general anesthesia surgery . Participants PVB group receive bolus dose ropivacaine , ropivacaine infusion induction general anesthesia . Upon emergence anesthesia , participant transfer post-anesthetic care unit ( PACU ) . Here , CEA participant start patient-controlled epidural analgesia ( PCEA ) bupivacaine hydromorphone plus self-administered bolus dose lockout period 30 min participant require additional pain relief , PVB participant start patient-controlled paravertebral analgesia ( PCPA ) ropivacaine plus self-administered bolus dose lockout period 30 min participant require additional pain relief . All participant receive oral hydromorphone every 4 hour require breakthrough pain relief start morning second postoperative day . A member research team ass presence severity pain nausea postoperative period . The assessment perform 30 minute arrival PACU , thereafter 4 , 8 , 24 , 48 , 72 hour surgery . Investigators ask participant give visual analogue score ( 0=no pain , 100=worst pain imaginable ) pain rest coughing , nausea score ( 0=none , 1=mild , 2=moderate , 3=vomiting ) list time point . At 72 hour surgery , participant satisfaction regard analgesia assess ( 1=poor , 2=fair , 3=good , 4=excellent ) . The requirement breakthrough pain relief , time first breakthrough pain relief request , cumulative opioid consumption record postoperative 72 hour .</detailed_description>
