	<brief_summary>Obtaining appropriate mydriasis prior cataract surgery important variable successful surgery . The current practice include use topical anticholinergic sympathomimetic agent preoperative area prior cataract surgery , pupils sometimes insufficiently dilate often need additional mydriasis intracameral agent cataract surgery . Pre-operative topical mydriatic drop take time take effect , mildly uncomfortable patient , cost healthcare system . If intracameral mydriasis alone achieve adequate pupil dilation , perhaps topical mydriatic would need . The purpose study evaluate whether topical versus intracameral versus topical + intracameral mydriasis optimal way dilate pupil routine cataract surgery . The result study implication improve efficiency reduce time prior cataract surgery . In addition , significant potential reduce cost associate cataract surgery preoperative drop eliminate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Recent research compare use intracameral topical agent preoperative pupil size cataract surgery success . Studies compare topical mydriatic intracameral lidocaine find significant difference dilation . , Other study compare topical mydriatic intracameral dilation include solution without epinephrine irrigate solution conclude irrigating solution without epinephrine safely use intracameral mydriatic epinephrine useful use topical mydriatic . There also study compare success longer act drug insert mydriatic agent use intracameral agent . In addition standard agent , different surgeon use various formulation topical intracameral agent perform mydriasis . As yet , formal , standardized method mydriasis large prospective study compare outcomes various method . Considerations cost time spend preoperative mydriatic agent light amount success see agent call question need agent . We would like study amount pupillary dilation see topical preoperative mydriatic agent compare intracameral agent compare use together . This prospective randomized control trial . Patients consent enrolled pre-op visit . They randomize topical drop alone , intracameral injection alone , topical plus intracameral mydriasis . All patient receive intracameral lidocaine , use anesthetic effect also mydriatic effect . The intervention take place day operation . Patients follow post-operative month # 1 . Data gather 4 visit : pre-op clinic visit , day operation , post-operative day # 1 post-operative month # 1 . These standard visit routine cataract surgery , study require patient make extra visit . Enrollment continue sample size meet . Patients blind whether receive topical mydriasis eyedrop , placebo drop necessary patient voluntarily control pupillary constriction , placebo effect would expect . The surgeon blind whether patient receive topical mydriasis eyedrops pre-op area evident base upon whether patient 's eye dilate . Another researcher present operate room grade photograph measure pupil size , researcher blind intervention patient receive . Currently , surgeon use topical plus intracameral mydriasis mydriasis cataract surgery . It hypothesize intracameral mydriasis alone may sufficient adequately dilate pupil cataract surgery . Patients adequately dilated time pupil size measurement immediately capsulorrhexis step subsequently receive additional pharmacologic mydriasis , visco-dilation , iris expansion device dilate pupil size adequate surgery . Therefore , matter group patient , pupil eventually dilate size adequate proceed surgery . There placebo non-treatment group , since patient must somehow dilated order undergo cataract surgery . The purpose study compare 3 method dilation . The pupil size measure viscoelastic injected capsulorrhexis perform . Treatment failure define pupil size clinically deem small safely proceed surgery ( approximately less 5 mm ) . At point , rescue intervention implement additional pharmacologic mydriasis , visco-dilation , iris expansion device , pupil adequately dilate proceed surgery . These patient still include study , pupil size prior rescue intervention still primary outcome . Participants choose stop participating study prior receive mydriasis agent . Should choose withdraw study , would end receive routine mydriasis topical plus intracameral agent . The study end post-op month # 1 individual patient . The study enrollment period end sample size meet .</detailed_description>
