	<brief_title>Three Dimensional Digital Preoperative Planning Osteosynthesis Distal Radius Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients Methods The study protocol approve Institutional Review Board . Thirty wrists 30 distal radius fracture patient underwent osteosynthesis use lock plate ( 19 female , 11 male ; age range 23-89 , mean age 59.5 year ) evaluate . Patients exclude report previous history traumatic injury arm . The patient divide two group : 15 patient plan group utilize 3D digital preoperative planning software , 15 patient control group utilized standard preoperative assessment plain radiograph CT scan . The age , sex , fracture type match group . According preoperative CT scan , fracture classify use AO classification system . Preoperative Planning In plan group , 3D digital preoperative planning surgical simulation perform order determine reduction placement implant addition plate/screw size prior surgery . Reduction placement implant simulate use software newly-developed author ( Zed-Trauma , LEXI Co. , Ltd. Tokyo , Japan ) . Planning use software base digital imaging communication medicine ( DICOM ) data CT scan . All preoperative planning group patient pre- post-operative CT scan order compare plan post-operative reduction shape placement implant . The CT comprise contiguous section 1 mm thickness . The software allow surgeon 1 ) visualize fracture displacement , 2 ) simulate reposition fragment , 3 ) place plate screw , 4 ) adjust sizes implant , 5 ) check shape reduction implant placement measure anatomical shape ( Figure 1 2 ) . After import DICOM image software , 3D image distal radius make . Each distal radius fracture segment accord main fracture fragment use cut function . Each fragment reposition accordance fracture line . After reposition fragment , bone shape check three dimensionally . Reduction fragment perform regain volar tilt radial inclination , less 2mm step-off intra-articular displacement refer healthy side wrist X ray . Simulation implantation volar lock plate use 3D template variable sizes plate screw . The Stellar II lock plate ( HOYA Technosurgical , Inc. , Tokyo , Japan ) use study . This plate system small , medium , large size width , short long sizes plate length . Screw lengths 10 24 mm distal ( 2.4 mm diameter ) , 10 20 mm proximal ( 2.6 mm diameter ) available . Computer aid design model different-sized implant instal software . The plate size choose cover distal fragment maximally exceed width distal radius . The plan make single hand surgeon . After plan , osteosynthesis perform general anesthesia . During surgery , operator perform reduction placement plate comparing image preoperative plan fluoroscopy . The surgeon try reproduce plan position implant check distance margin implant margin radius fluoroscopy . The screw size determined intraoperative measurement reference preoperative plan . For screw fixation , guide block use insert distal screw . In control group , preoperative planning perform use conventional posterior-anterior lateral view radiograph . Based X-ray image , plate size chosen use conventional template . After plan , osteosynthesis perform general anesthesia manner plan group . The surgery perform several resident fellows supervision hand surgeon . Evaluations The plan size implant compare actual size use operation plan group . The screw hole number 1 8 distal ( 7 hole small medium plate , 8 hole large plate ) , 1 3 proximal . The screw length actually choose record accord screw number . To evaluate accuracy anatomical reduction , volar tilt radial inclination post-operative wrist X-ray compare healthy side wrist plan control group . The posterior-anterior view obtain elbow flexed 90° , ulna perpendicular humerus , forearm pronate position . The lateral view obtain elbow flex 90° adducted trunk . The wrist neutral position flexion , extension , deviation either view . Volar tilt measure lateral view . The angle line along distal radial articular surface line perpendicular longitudinal axis radius joint margin measure volar tilt . Radial inclination measure posterior-anterior view . The angle one line connect radial styloid tip ulnar aspect distal radius second line perpendicular longitudinal axis radius measure radial inclination . These radiological parameter measure single hand surgeon . In addition , preoperative planning postoperative reduction compare measure volar tilt radial inclination 3D image plan group ( Figure 3 ) . The axis radius adjust . The angle line dorsal edge volar edge radius line perpendicular longitudinal axis radius measure 3D volar tilt . The angle line radial styloid tip ulnar aspect distal radius line perpendicular longitudinal axis radius measure 3D radial inclination . Statistical Analysis The result express mean +/- standard deviation . An intra-class correlation coefficient ( ICC ) use evaluate accuracy anatomical reduction . The ICC value radiological parameter ( volar tilt radial inclination ) healthy side wrist injure side wrist surgery evaluate plan control group . In addition , ICCs 3D measurement pre-operative plan post-operative 3D image evaluate plan group . For accuracy implant choice , ICCs screw length preoperative plan actual choice evaluate . According previous recommendation12 , ICC le 0.40 consider poor reproducibility , 0.40 0.59 consider moderate , 0.60 0.74 consider good , 0.75 1.00 consider excellent . The difference preoperative plan postoperative reduction , healthy side injured side surgery analyze use pair t-test . P value &lt; 0.05 consider significant . All analysis perform use SPSS version 13.0 ( SPSS , Chicago , IL , USA ) .</detailed_description>
