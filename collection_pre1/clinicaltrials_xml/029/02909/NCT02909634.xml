	<brief_summary>Currently , number patient either permanent temporary stoma place increase year . Yet , patient ostomy pouch often struggle predict stool output occur plan around dynamic change intestinal activity . Ostom-I provide real-time assessment volume ostomy bag , predict fast output occur . In pilot study investigator aim gather normative AbStats Ostom-I data participant ostomy improve prediction stool output . Aim 1 : To gather normative AbStats Ostom-I data subject ostomy improve prediction stool output . Aim 2 : Correlate data wearable biosensors test predictive validity AbStats determine ostomy bag fill measure Ostom-I .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combining Ostom-I With Abstats Sensors Improve Prediction Ostomy Output</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Ostom-I device wireless , wearable biosensor approve U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . The device discrete , lightweight , apply ostomy pouch order monitor fill bag . It use Bluetooth technology send signal participant smartphone alert user ostomy bag fill decide empty . The second wearable biosensor call `` AbStats '' provide objective , real-time marker intestinal motility , also FDA approve . It allow continuous automate analysis intestinal vibration . The study team recruit consecutive inpatient undergo colorectal surgery ostomy placement . The surgeon apply AbStats Ostom-I upon completion operation . Device recording continue discharge , participant opts remove sensor request . Members research team blind sensor result monitor record clinical information include age , gender , race , body mass index ( BMI ) . The study team also record type ostomy , indication surgery , type surgery perform , surgical approach , document operative complication . The study team prospectively monitor daily clinical assessment , include symptom ( nausea , vomit , abdominal pain ) , flatus , bowel movement , diet , ambulation , medication use , length hospitalization . All patient receive standardize feeding protocol part usual care . For Cedars-Sinai , standard protocol initiate clear liquid postoperative day ( POD ) zero , rapid progression regular diet morning POD # 1 patient without early clinical evidence post-operative ileus ( POI ) . Patients intolerant feed protocol , include nausea vomit preclude advancement , develop significant abdominal distension , discontinue feed protocol . The surgical team make decision regard diet change blind device data .</detailed_description>
