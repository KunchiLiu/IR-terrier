	<brief_title>Quality Recovery After Reversal With Neostigmine Sugammadex .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sugammadex show faster onset reliable reversal neuromuscular blockade compare neostigmine measure return Train-of-four ( TOF ) ratio &gt; 0.9 . ( Breuckmann , 2015 ) The investigator 's hypothesis sugammadex associate improved deep breathing measure incentive spirometry PACU . The investigator also hypothesize patient reverse sugammadex shorter time extubation good recovery profile PACU measure strength , PACU discharge readiness quality recovery score . Residual neuromuscular blockade surgery result airway compromise , pulmonary complication , possible need reintubation negative experience patient . Reintubation surgery currently quality measure NSQIP ( National Surgery Quality Improvement Program ) A TOF ratio &lt; 0.9 identified marker residual neuromuscular blockade PACU . ( Farhan 2013 ) Several clinical trial show reversal neuromuscular blockade sugammadex result faster reliable return TOF ratio &gt; 0.9 compare neostigmine . However study primarily report TOF ratio . There scant data clinical outcome reversal neostigmine versus sugammadex . Incentive spirometry clinically meaningful measurement postoperative pulmonary function , i.e ability breath deeply , minimize atelectasis risk postoperative pneumonia . The investigator compare recovery profile patient receive sugammadex neostigmine reversal neuromuscular blockade surgery . The primary outcome incentive spirometry volume surgery measure pulmonary function . The secondary measure include hand grip measure use dynamometer , time extubation , time PACU discharge , time sit independently , quality recovery 15 survey score . This single-center , prospective , randomize , assessor blind , control trial . Patients randomize either receive sugammadex neostigmine reversal neuromuscular blockade . The anesthesiologist unblinded study drug however assessor PACU blind .</detailed_description>
