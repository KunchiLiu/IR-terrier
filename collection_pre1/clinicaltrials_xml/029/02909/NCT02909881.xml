	<brief_summary>PhytoSpherix ( Phx ) all-natural , edible polysaccharide extract sweet corn . This carbohydrate major muscle fuel intense exercise store quite small one run single exercise bout . Therefore , Phx provide significant exercise fuel consume exercise . As result intake could enhance intense exercise performance provide additional fuel . This experiment Will investigate effect 4 different dosage Phx consume throughout prolonged exercise bout carbohydrate fat utilization well oxidation rate perception effort prolong intense exercise trained cyclist . Muscle liver carbohydrate store examine use non-invasive ultrasound technique .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Carbohydrate ( CHO ) one main substrate oxidize moderate-to-high intensity , endurance-type exercise . It 's show CHO feed exercise enhances endurance performance capacity , attribute mainly facilitation great rate exogenous CHO oxidation , prevention hypoglycaemia spar muscle glycogen . Previous study base supplementation glucose 180 min . cycling exercise report maximal rate exogenous CHO oxidation 1 g/min . Other study show CHO oxidation rate reach peak value 1.3 g/min combination fructose glucose ingested rate 1.8 g/min . The limitation uptake oxidation single CHO source attribute intestinal transporter saturation multiple CHO source use uptake oxidation rate increase great extent . Currently information regard Phx uptake oxidation rate CHO source exercise . Also , important investigate whether Phx CHO sport drink increase performance spar muscle liver glycogen exercise . Therefore , objective experiment measure dose response Phx oxidation rate prolong cycling exercise effect muscle liver glycogen level .</detailed_description>
