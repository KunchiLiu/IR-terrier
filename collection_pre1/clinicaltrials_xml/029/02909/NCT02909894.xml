	<detailed_description>- Familiarisation screen visit - ( Visit 1 ) Before participate study , participant visit exercise laboratory familiarisation screen visit show designated experimental area , provide write informed consent various measurement take . All participant require fast 10pm onwards even prior first visit ( drink water allow ) . Participants provide standardised breakfast arrival ( consent obtain ) . This meal prescribe accord body mass provide approximately 8 kcals per kg bodyweight make 13-14 % protein , 51-52 % carbohydrate 35 % fat . Typical ingredient use ; Plain bagel margarine protein powder mixed whole milk . Alternative ingredient match nutritional content meal explore light special dietary preference ( i.e . vegan ) food allergy ( i.e . lactose intolerance ) . It also important participant avoid general exercise drinking alcohol coffee 48 hour ( 2 day ) lead first visit ( remain two visit ) , make clear participant information sheet . Very strenuous exercise must avoid 72 hour ( 3 day ) prior . Participants ask record food drink consume day first visit . They ask replicate diet day remain visit use dietary record guide . Therefore , meal lead visit standardise confound result . The measurement take visit include ; basic anthropometry ( body mass , waist circumference , body fat % ) ; blood pressure ; biochemical variable ( HbA1c blood lipid CRP ) ; Energy expenditure ( rest , slow steady state treadmill walk numerous intensity arm ergometer machine ) ; measure objectively determine free-living physical activity , sedentary behaviour posture . Anthropometry measurement visit 1 Arterial blood pressure measure sit position . Three measurement obtain average last two measurement use . Basic anthropometric measure body mass body fat percentage ( measure bio impedance analysis ) take alongside height waist circumference ( midpoint low costal margin iliac crest ) . These record near 0.1kg , 0.5 % , 0.5cm 0.5cm respectively . Biochemical variable collect visit 1 During visit one blood sample take whereby HbA1c ( Glycated Haemoglobin ) , CRP ( C-Reactive Protein ) lipid profile measure . All venepuncture undertake trained health care professional biochemical analysis conduct blind treatment condition . All participant send individual result letter highlight main clinical result familiarisation visit . With participant consent , result copy GP . Any participant whose Hba1c 6.5 % send individual result letter strongly advise make appointment GP soon possible discus result detail , indicative Diabetes . Similarly , participant whose HbA1c 6 6.4 % also send individual result letter advise make appointment GP concern , indicative pre-diabetes . With participant consent , GP also notify situation send result letter Energy Expenditure test visit 1 During visit one , energy expenditure rest , walk 3km/hr perform arm ergometry different intensity measure via respiratory gas collect participant use Cortex GEM breath-by-breath automate gas-analysis system . In order ass rest energy expenditure , participant ask sit quietly ( refrain movement ) 30 minute wear gas mask/hood . Expired gas data collect latter half 30 minute period value stabilise . Following , walk perform 3km.hr treadmill 10 minute ( also wear gas mask ) , expire gas data collect latter 5 minute . Light arm ergometry seat perform 5 minute interval ( across numerous intensity ) expire gas data collect 2nd 3rd 4th minute , discard first last minute . Participants also remove face-mask 5minutes 5 minute bout order allow participant recover energy expenditure output return rest level prior next activity bout . This data consequently dictate intensity arm ergometry perform break sit time , investigator would like energy expenditure seat break closely resemble light walk . This allow investigator elucidate role posture alone energy expenditure keep relatively consistent previous research , allow direct comparison make . Objective measure physical activity visit 1 Participants issue Actigraph accelerometer measure time spend sedentary moderate vigorous physical activity free-living condition . Participants ask wear accelerometer ( place right anterior axillary line ) 7 day familiarisation visit , 7 day lead treatment condition throughout experimental condition order monitor potential change physical activity level make sure participant avoid exercise day lead treatment condition . Outputs include step per day , total body movement ( count per day ) , time sedentary , light , moderate vigorous-intensity physical activity determine count per minute cut point propose Freedson et al . ( 21 ) Posture sedentary time data collection visit 1 Postural allocation ( sit stand ) walk quantify use activPAL physical activity monitor ( PAL Technologies , Glasgow , Scotland ) . The activPAL single-unit monitor base triaxial accelerometer worn midline anterior aspect thigh attach directly onto skin use medical dressing . The monitor produce signal related thigh inclination show valid reliable measurement tool determine posture activity daily live healthy population ( 22 ) . Outputs device include ; time spent sitting , stand , step sit-to-stand transition . The device wear 7 day familiarisation visit , ( alongside Actigraph ) throughout experimental condition . - Experimental treatment condition ( Visits 2 3 ) In week follow initial familiarization visit , participant assign receive follow two treatment condition ( A : Prolonged sit B : Light arm ergometry break ) random order use online randomisation tool . Each treatment condition carry one single day . In total , study require three separate visit Leicester Diabetes Centre , Leicester General Hospital , University Hospitals Leicester ; familiarisation visit , first treatment condition second treatment condition . Where participant limit access motorise transport , taxi provide reduce ambulatory activity involve commute visit . For male participant , minimum 7 day treatment condition . For female , gap one month ( near possible ) due potential different phase woman 's menstrual cycle may affect blood glucose response meal ( 23 ) . Testing similar time month avoids potential variability . However , female participant report post-menopausal pre-screening questionnaire minimum 7 day treatment condition use . Treatment Condition A : Prolonged sit During prolonged sit condition , participant restrict walk stand . They designate room equip chair/desk access computer internet service , book magazine movie throughout day . Lavatory break permit wheelchair use wheel participant toilet reduce upright activity . The day treatment condition , participant ask consume type quantity food drink record prior familiarisation visit . Participants also ask avoid alcohol , caffeine moderate intensity exercise 2 day prior treatment condition ( do prior visit one ) reproducibility data show insulin triglyceride response meal ingestion good condition ( 24 ) . Furthermore , evidence effect single exercise session insulin sensitivity glucose tolerance may last 48 hour ( 25 ) . Strenuous exercise avoid 3 day prior treatment condition , find increase insulin sensitivity 72 hour ( 26 ) . Participants ask fast night treatment condition ( prior familiarisation discuss previously ) 10pm onwards . On morning test , participant cannula insert accessible vein train health care professional first blood sample take ( represent time point : -1hr accord figure 1 ) . Blood pressure measurement take immediately blood sample alongside self-reported measure positive affect , mood sleepiness ( see description secondary outcome section 3.0 ) . Once cannula insert first blood sample take , participant ask sit quietly 60 minute order achieve steady state . During time , participant expect complete battery cognitive function test last approximately 25 minute ( see description secondary outcome section 4.0 ) . Following 60 minute period , participant another blood pressure measurement , positive affect , mood sleepiness assessment blood sample take , point provide standardise mixed meal breakfast ( 09:00am ) ( time point : 0h ) . The meal prescribe accord body mass provide approximately 8kcals per kg bodyweight make 13-14 % protein , 51-52 % carbohydrate 35 % fat . A mixed-meal nature use ensure ecological validity fat carbohydrate usually co-ingested real-life situation . Blood sample alongside positive affect , mood , sleepiness blood pressure measurement continue 30 , 60 , 120 180 minute follow breakfast . A second , lunch meal ( 12:00pm ) ( identical nutrient composition breakfast ) , consume 15 minute . Blood pressure , positive affect , mood , sleepiness blood sample continue 30 , 60 , 120 180 minute follow lunch ( Figure 1 ) . Participants repeat battery cognitive function test final blood sample take . All participant remain sit throughout test period whilst undertake typical sedentary pursuit watch TV/DVDs/reading . Treatment Condition B : Light arm ergometry break This identical prolong sit condition ( Treatment A ) , participant require break restful sit time seat upper body contractile activity . This implemented form arm ergometry break 5 minute every 30 minute follow breakfast lunch . In total , individual accumulate 12 bout ( 60 minute ) light intensity arm ergometry . The main reason utilise 5 minute bout every 30 minute achieve balance frequency utility , interrupt sit time regularly less real world application , especially office base environment prolong sit prevalent . Previous research also find positive finding interrupt sit time manner ( 38 ) . The intensity ( speed resistance ) arm ergometry break derive energy expenditure test conduct visit 1 , investigator aim match intensity arm ergometry light walk 3km/hr .</detailed_description>
