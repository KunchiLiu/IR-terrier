A primary source poor glucose control adolescent skip insulin bolus mealtimes . Advances glucose sensor motivate research towards closed-loop delivery system automatically regulate glucose level . Closed-loop delivery ( artificial pancreas ) compose insulin pump , continuous glucose sensor dose algorithm calculates insulin dose infuse base sensor reading . The performance closed-loop delivery miss bolus may improve computer program calculates insulin enhanced meal detection module . The meal detection module automatically detect meal ( bolus deliver ) , signal delivery insulin . The aim study assess safety efficacy closed-loop delivery without meal detection module compare conventional pump therapy regulate post-prandial glycemic level omission meal bolus .

	<detailed_description>Despite current treatment type 1 diabetes , maintain blood glucose level within good range difficult task . A primary source poor glucose control adolescent skip insulin bolus mealtimes . Advances glucose sensor motivate research towards closed-loop delivery system automatically regulate glucose level . Closed-loop delivery ( artificial pancreas ) compose insulin pump , continuous glucose sensor dose algorithm calculates insulin dose infuse base sensor reading . The performance closed-loop delivery miss bolus may improve computer program calculates insulin enhanced meal detection module . The meal detection module automatically detect meal ( bolus deliver ) , signal delivery insulin . The aim study conduct randomize , three-way , cross-over trial compare efficacy closed-loop delivery , closed-loop delivery meal detection module , conventional pump therapy . The study aim compare three intervention 9 hour adolescent poorly control type 1 diabetes . Each 9 hour include two meal different carbohydrate content , one carbohydrate-matched prandial bolus . This study allow assessment safety efficacy closed-loop delivery without meal detection module compare conventional pump therapy regulate post-prandial glycaemia . The aim study assess safety efficacy closed-loop delivery without meal detection module compare conventional pump therapy regulate post-prandial glycemic level omission meal bolus . The primary hypothesis closed-loop delivery meal detection module reduce mean increase postprandial glucose level miss bolus compare conventional pump therapy . The secondary hypothesis : 1 . Closed-loop delivery meal detection module reduce mean increase postprandial glucose level miss bolus compare conventional pump therapy . 2 . Closed-loop delivery meal detection module reduce mean increase postprandial glucose level miss bolus compare closed-loop delivery meal detection module .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Clinical diagnosis type 1 diabetes least 12 month . ( The diagnosis type 1 diabetes base investigator 's judgment ; C peptide level antibody determination need . ) 2 . The participant insulin pump therapy least 3 month . 3 . HbA1c 8.0 % 12 % . 4 . Selfreported documented history missedbolus meal previous 6 month . 1 . Clinically significant nephropathy , neuropathy retinopathy judge investigator . 2 . Severe hypoglycemic episode within one month screening . 3 . Pregnancy . 4 . Current use oral glucocorticoid medication ( except low stable dose ) . Stable dos inhaled steroid acceptable . 5 . Known suspect allergy trial product , include meal content . 6 . Other serious medical illness likely interfere study participation ability complete trial judgment investigator . 7 . Failure comply team 's recommendation ( e.g . willing eat meals/snacks , willing change pump parameter , etc . ) .</criteria>
