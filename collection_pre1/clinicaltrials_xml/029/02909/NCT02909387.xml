	<brief_title>Adapting Project UPLIFT Blacks Georgia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Project UPLIFT manualized intervention include script use telephone facilitator lead activity discussion ; use script possible delivery face-to-face . Activities discussion design increase knowledge epilepsy mental health ; monitoring , challenge , change thought ; cop relaxing ; attention mindfulness ; focusing pleasure ; importance reinforcement ; prevent relapse . Sessions design last one hour telephone , comprise check-in period , teach topic week 's session , group discussion , skill-building exercise , recommend practice week . They co-facilitated research staff UPLIFT train adult epilepsy . The facilitator lead eight session particular group . Facilitators receive train delivery program , include delivery practice session , Co-PI , Georgia-licensed clinical psychologist . She also supervise facilitator throughout program delivery . As noted , spiritualism religion ; oral , interpersonal communication ; appreciation intuition experience commonly hold value African American community . This suggest Project UPLIFT , activity base experiential , meditative exercise , oral , group discussion telephone may good fit . Design . The outcome evaluation efficacy Project UPLIFT telephone intervention group assess use cross-over design . Participants/Procedure . A total 60 participant recruit . Participants must self-identify black African American .

After 12-participant cohort recruit , randomly assign Stratum 1 ( intervention ) Stratum 2 ( treatment-as-usual waitlist ) . During week 1-4 , participant pre-tested . During week 5-10 , participant Stratum 1 receive Project UPLIFT , participant Stratum 2 call weekly brief check-in . During week 11-14 , participant receive interim testing . During week 15-22 , participant Stratum 2 receive Project UPLIFT . During week 23-26 , participant post-tested . Five month completion final UPLIFT session , participant contact follow-up assessment . During intervention stratum 1 , stratum 2 serve control . In addition , design allow replication result initial intervention group ( stratum 1 ) delay intervention group ( stratum 2 ) . By end intervention , 10 6-person group receive intervention . Research Strategy Conferencing Methods . In order participant communicate one another well facilitator , telecommunicate group intervention session use Reservationless-Plus Conferencing . This conferencing method allow moderator record call also screen participant wait join call option accept reject wait , dismiss in-meeting participant , lock meeting well dial participant . Use service free charge MSM faculty provide toll-free phone number participant . Therefore , additional equipment need long distancecharges incur participant . Measures Screening Measures include follow : Mental Stability assess use T-MMSE .

Effectiveness intervention assess compare change knowledge , skill , epilepsy self management pretest interim test posttest across stratum . Changes anxiety , depression , PTSD symptom score also evaluate use method describe . Knowledge Skills assess use measure prior study Project UPLIFT.This instrument include two section , one knowledge one skill . The knowledge item true-false response . The skill item Likert-scaled response option measure value skill frequency use skill . Self management assess use late version Epilepsy Self Management Scale ( ESMS ) . The current version instrument include 38-items take 10 minute complete . IT include subscales Medication Management , Information Management , Safety Management , Seizure Management , Lifestyle Management . Depressive Symptoms assess use two different measure .

Item responses 4-point Likert scale 1 ( ) 4 ( time ) . Likert-scale score permit measurement symptom severity . This instrument test across range diverse trauma sample include whiplash patient , rape victim , disaster victim . Evaluation . Process evaluation data obtain attendance record intervention session .
