	<brief_summary>Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine ( SP ) currently recommend World Health Organization use intermittent preventive treatment malaria pregnancy ( IPTp ) area moderate high malaria transmission . However , locales malaria parasites lose sensitivity SP , compromise protective effect . Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine ( DP ) candidate replacement SP . This trial design confirm cardio-safety DP compare SP amongst pregnant woman Tanzania .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cardio‑Safety Dihydroartemisinin‑Piperaquine Pharmacokinetics Piperaquine Amongst Pregnant Women Tanzania</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial hypothesis DP increase time start Q wave end T wave heart 's electrical cycle , phenomenon refer QT prolongation , study population . However , QT prolongation observe , expect time-limited clinical consequence . The QT interval , measure millisecond ( MS ) correct ( QTc ) account natural heart rate ( HR ) extremes . The Fridericia formula also use correct ( QTcF ) variation cardio-contraction . As part electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , period begin P wave begin QRS complex ( PR interval ) measure , well ST-segment connects QRS complex T wave . Prolongation QT interval estimate peak drug-concentrations likely find peripheral blood measure use pharmacokinetic ( PK ) technique . Polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) method use genetic sequence molecular marker ( A581G ) associate malaria parasite drug resistance SP . The rapid diagnostic test ( RDT ) CareStart™ use screen pregnant woman attend antenatal care .</detailed_description>
