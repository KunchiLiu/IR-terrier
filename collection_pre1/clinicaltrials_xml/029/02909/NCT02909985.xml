	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Visual impairment affect 285 million people worldwide . The prevalence visual impairment US expect rise 3.3 million 2000 5.5 million 2020 . This exacerbate current economic burden vision loss , already $ 38.2 billion per year direct indirect cost . The lead cause blindness high income country due age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) , disease lead gradual loss photoreceptor cell layer . An estimated 1.75 million people AMD US another 7.3 million risk . Importantly , despite loss photoreceptor cell AMD , cellular layer retina remain largely intact . The retina line back eye compose structural layer . The out nuclear layer contain photoreceptors call rod cone . The inner nuclear layer include bipolar , horizontal , amacrine cell . Most anteriorly , ganglion cell layer axon exit eye optic nerve . Visual image formation begin photon light enters eye , pass retinal layer , absorb photoreceptor cell . These cell transduce photon light electrochemical signal , communicate bipolar cell , follow ganglion cell . Here , action potential generate propagated via optic nerve area brain vision perception occur . When eye dark adapt , cell pathway potentially sensitive type stimulus , IR . The investigator believe cation channel call TRP channel ganglion cell activate IR dark adapt state , create visual response IR . Heat known activator certain subtypes channel elsewhere body . TRP channel also responsible IR vision pit viper vampire bat . Palczewska et al . report visual perception IR occur process direct two-photon isomerization visual pigment . However , evidence suggest IR perception occur single IR photon absorption . Studies use IR test functionality implant visual prosthesis note great response IR non-implanted eye compare implanted eye VEP test ERG . On ERG , specialize response specific IR find call scotopic threshold response ( STR ) . This response occur dark-adapted condition correlate response ganglion cell layer . Direct IR activation TRP channel ganglion cell could initiate visual response . Based finding , investigator hypothesize human response IR dark adaptation occur level ganglion cell heat-activated TRP channel . RESEARCH DESIGN AIM1 : To determine optimal IR wavelength human visual perception dark-adapted . Introduction Aim 1 : The objective aim determine optimal wavelength IR human eye sensitive . To obtain objective , investigator test work hypothesis healthy human eye , colorblindness , detect range IR wavelength , preference specific wavelength . The investigator test work hypothesis use broad-spectrum light source wavelength-specific bandpass filter IR range . The investigator rationale aim understand optimal IR wavelength human eye aid future investigation test visual response IR use diagnostic equipment . This important could impact way ophthalmologic modality use IR diagnosis treat visual pathology . Research Design Aim 1 : A total healthy 25 participant ( 15 normal vision 10 colorblindness ) age 18 older recruit use University New Mexico ( UNM ) Clinical Translational Science Center ( CTSC ) Clinical Research Volunteer Registry HRRC-06412 . Informed consent , participant demographic , past medial visual history , general eye exam obtain use CTSC research coordinator . Each participant place dark room hour allow optimal dark adaptation eye . The investigator use broad-spectrum light source wavelength-specific bandpass filter different IR wavelength . A total 12 filter use range 850 nm 1400nm . Intensity curve build wavelength , slow turn power participant indicate visual response stimulus . Data Analysis Aim 1 : Data analyze investigator . Descriptive statistic use evaluate demographic , general visual health information , report optimal wavelength . The investigator analysis compare difference among response wavelength . To investigator knowledge study evaluate IR wavelength optimal human visual perception , thus investigator assume low effect size 10 % , would produce 82 % chance least two 30 healthy participant give preferred response specific wavelength . The investigator describe estimate effect size response finding . Expected Outcomes Aim 1 : The investigator expect human eye perceive range IR wavelength , specific wavelength optimal term brightness . Potential Problems &amp; Alternative Strategies Aim 1 : To prevent sample bias , investigator plan obtain representative sample New Mexico ; however , participant may younger educate general population . Confounding bias light pollution may occur , would prevent dark adaptation decrease IR sensitivity . A photometer ass room background photon . AIM 2 : To test electrophysiologic response IR healthy human dark adaptation . Introduction Aim 2 : The objective aim determine site IR transduction visual pathway . To obtain objective , investigator test work hypothesis IR elicit amplitude change human subject ERG VEP test dark adaptation . The investigator test work hypothesis clinical trial electrophysiologic visual response baseline visible light compare IR . The investigator rationale aim propose research contribute important understanding alternative mechanism vision . It important investigate pathway understand general visual health demonstrate IR directly elicit visual response . Such find would important would expand visually responsive light spectrum include IR . Research Design Aim 2 : A total 6 healthy participant age 18 older recruit use criterion Aim 1 . The investigator collect documentation health information Aim 1 . Participants test UNM Eye Clinic use VEP ERG baseline dark adapt IR condition . Both test non-invasive consider safe . The International Society Clinical Electrophysiology Vision ( ISCEV ) guideline clinical VEPs full-field ERGs follow . These protocol extend test IR stimulus dark adaptation . Total time participant 5 hour participate . Data Analysis Aim 2 : Data analyze investigator . Descriptive statistic describe demographic general visual health information . As per ISCEV protocol , experiment outside normal laboratory range , investigator assume normal distribution . Reports specify stimulus record parameter . The investigator primary analysis test underlie probability response stimulus use binomial distribution ( HO = 0 , HI &gt; 0 ) . Using exact test , investigator secondary analysis compare difference among dark adaptation time interval 0 , 15 , 30 , 45 , 60 minute stimulus type , tertiary analysis compare difference baseline IR stimulus time interval . The investigator pilot data animal model demonstrate consistent visual response IR . However , investigator knowledge , electrophysiologic study IR stimulus human . Thus , investigator assume low effect size . However , due cost diagnostic test limit 5 participant . The investigator describe estimate effect size response find . Expected Outcomes Aim 2 : The investigator expect IR response ERG VEP dark-adapted human . Potential Problems &amp; Alternative Strategies Aim 2 : Aim 2 share potential problem Aim 1 , investigator address identical manner . In addition , calibration bias may occur ERG VEP . The investigator follow ISCEV protocol test . IR trial may require average additional stimulus repetition improve signal-to-noise ratio ERG VEP signal . To avoid bias interpretation result , The investigator use intra inter-reliability comparison . AIM 3 : To test electrophysiologic response IR humans retinal disease injury dark adaptation . Introduction Aim 3 : The objective aim determine retinal cell layer respond IR nature TRP channel involvement . To obtain objective , investigator test work hypothesis IR elicit amplitude change certain retinal disease . The investigator test work hypothesis clinical trial test visual response IR certain retinal disease use ERG VEP . The investigator rationale aim propose research examine certain retinal disease visually sensitive IR . This important investigate could allow different approach visual research certain retinal disease . Such find would important could provide basis novel form visual prosthesis . Research Design Aim 3 : A total twenty-five participant , five per retinal disease , recruit use CTSC Clinical Research Volunteer Registry HRRC-06412 . Retinal disease include retinitis pigmentosa , age relate macular degeneration , congenital stationary night blindness , cataract . Five participant colorblindness also include . The protocol follow aim 2 demographic collection ERG VEP test baseline dark-adapted condition . Data Analysis Aim 3 : In addition use type data analysis Aim 2 , result also compare retinal disease healthy participant . Expected Outcomes Aim 3 : The investigator expect IR elicit response ERG VEP certain retinal disease dark-adaptation .
