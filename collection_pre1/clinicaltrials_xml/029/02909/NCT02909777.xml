	<brief_summary>This research study evaluate novel drug call CUDC-907 possible treatment resistant ( refractory ) pediatric solid tumor ( include neuroblastoma ) , lymphoma , brain tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial CUDC-907 Children Young Adults With Relapsed Refractory Solid Tumors , CNS Tumors , Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase I clinical trial . A Phase I clinical trial test safety investigational intervention also try find best dose investigational intervention use study . `` Investigational '' mean intervention study . The FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve CUDC-907 treatment option disease . This first time CUDC-907 give child . In research study , investigator evaluate new drug , CUDC-907 , potential new treatment child solid tumor , lymphoma brain tumor . CUDC-907 oral drug block certain protein tumor cell . These protein may important growth cancer . Laboratory experiment result adult study demonstrate CUDC-907 may stop tumor growth , case , cause tumor cell die . CUDC-907 test adult cancer find side effect dose adult . The primary goal study evaluate side effect CUDC-907 find best dose CUDC-907 use child . Other goal study determine whether drug may benefit type cancer see child measure effect CUDC-907 blood .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age &gt; 1 year ≤ 21 year time enrollment . Karnofsky performance status ≥ 50 % patient ≥16 year age Lansky ≥ 50 % patient &lt; 16 year age ( see Appendix A ) Diagnosis requirement For Parts A B , participant must evaluable measurable disease ( see Section 11 ) . For Part A , participant must histologically confirm solid tumor , CNS tumor , lymphoma base upon biopsy surgery initial diagnosis and/or relapse/progression . The exception histologic confirmation pediatric tumor routinely diagnose exclusively standard clinical imaging criterion : diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma optic pathway glioma . For Part B , participant must one follow diagnosis histologically confirm : Neuroblastoma evidence Mycn/Myc positivity base following : MYCN amplification ( &gt; 4 copy amplification ) COG reference laboratory CLIAcertified laboratory ; Mycn protein expression &gt; 1+ accord validate assay Children 's Hospital Los Angeles ( CHLA ) Clinical Pathology Laboratory ; Myc expression &gt; 1+ accord validate assay CHLA Clinical Pathology Laboratory . One follow mature B cell lymphoma diagnosis : Diffuse large B cell lymphoma Burkitt lymphoma Participants must disease relapsed refractory standard curative palliative measure exist longer effective . Patients must fully recover acute toxic effect prior anticancer therapy except organ function note Section 3.1.6 ) . Patients must meet follow minimum washout period prior enrollment : Myelosuppressive chemotherapy : At least 14 day last dose myelosuppressive chemotherapy ( 42 day nitrosourea mitomycin C ) . Radiotherapy : At least 14 day local palliative XRT ( small port ) ; At least 90 day must elapse prior TBI , craniospinal XRT &gt; 50 % radiation pelvis ; At least 42 must elapse substantial BM radiation ; At least 42 day must pass since last MIBG radionuclide therapy . Small molecule biologic therapy : At least 7 day follow last dose biologic agent . For agent know adverse event occur beyond 7 day , duration must extend beyond time adverse event know occur . If extend duration require , discuss approve study chair . Monoclonal antibody : At least 21 day 3 halflives antibody last dose , whichever longer . Myeloid growth factor : At least 14 day follow last dose longacting growth factor ( e.g . Neulasta ) 7 day follow shortacting growth factor . Stem Cell Infusion Cellular Therapies : The patient must evidence graft versus host disease least 42 day must elapse transplant , stem cell infusion , cellular therapy . Major Surgery : At least 3 week prior major surgical procedure . Note : Biopsy central line placement/removal consider major . PI3K HDAC inhibitor : The patient must receive prior CUDC907 therapy . Prior treatment individual PI3K HDAC inhibitor allow . Patients must receive therapy combination PI3K HDAC inhibitor . Participants must normal organ function define . Bone Marrow Function : Absolute neutrophil count ≥1,000/uL Platelets ≥75,000/uL transfusion independent , define receive platelet transfusion least 5 day prior CBC document eligibility . Hepatic Function : Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal age ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 135 U/L For purpose study , ULN ALT 45 U/L Serum albumin &gt; 2 g/dL Renal Function : A serum creatinine base age/gender follow : Age Maximum Serum Creatinine ( mg/dL ) Male Female 1. &lt; 2 year 0.6 0.6 2. &lt; 6 year 0.8 0.8 6 &lt; 10 year 1 1 10 &lt; 13 year 1.2 1.2 13 &lt; 16 year 1.5 1.4 ≥ 16 year 1.7 1.4 OR Creatinine clearance ≥ 70 mL/min/1.73 m2 participant creatinine level institutional normal . Adequate Cardiac Function : QTc &lt; 480 msec Adequate GI Function : Diarrhea &lt; grade 2 CTCAE version 4 Adequate Metabolic Function : Fasting glucose &lt; grade 2 ( &lt; 160 mg/dL &lt; 8.9 mmol/L ) without use antihyperglycemic agent . Additional AgentSpecific Requirements Patients must able swallow either intact capsule minitabs without chew . In order limit dose deviation due rounding , patient must body surface area least 0.5 m2 For patient CNS tumor ( primary metastatic ) , baseline neurologic deficit ( include seizure ) must stable least one week prior study enrollment . Ability understand and/or willingness patient ( parent legally authorize representative , minor ) provide inform consent , use institutionally approve informed consent procedure . Patients must receive follow concomitant medication : Pharmacologic dose systemic corticosteroid unless CNS metastatic primary disease . For patient CNS metastatic primary tumor receive corticosteroid , stable decrease dose 7 day prior registration meet criterion . For patient , receipt systemic physiologic replacement steroid , topical and/or inhale corticosteroid acceptable . Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug , oral anticoagulant , therapeutic heparin . Pregnant participant enter study give effect CUDC907 develop human fetus unknown . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother CUDC907 , breastfeed mother eligible . Participants childbearing childfathering potential must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal birth control ; intrauterine device ; double barrier method ; total abstinence ) throughout participation , include 30 day last dose CUDC907 . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition CUDC907 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Patients known history HIV , hepatitis B , and/or hepatitis C ( test require part screen ) . Patients known history type 1 type 2 diabetes mellitus . Patients gastrointestinal disease disorder could interfere absorption CUDC907 , bowel obstruction inflammatory bowel disease .</criteria>
