	<detailed_description>Autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) neurodevelopmental disorder affect 1 68 child , include 1 42 boy , characterize mark social communication impairment restrict , repetitive behavior interest . Evidence-based pharmacological treatment available treatment define symptom ASD currently lack . While etiology ASD fully understand , pathogenesis hypothesize involve cellular dysfunction , include increase oxidative stress , aberrant neuroinflammation , reduce mitochondrial capacity , lead synaptic dysfunction least subset individual . Sulforaphane powerful upregulator antioxidant response element heat shock protein , may lead improved redox capacity , decreased inflammation , improve mitochondrial functioning individual ASD . A trial Singh colleague ( 2014 ) provide preliminary evidence suggest sulforaphane derive broccoli sprout extract beneficial effect improve symptom autism . In study , young men age 13-30 year old moderate severe autism spectrum disorder randomly assign receive either sulforaphane supplement placebo 12 week treatment treatment period , follow 4 week blind discontinuation phase . The uncoated tablet contain 125 mg broccoli seed extract 50 mg broccoli sprout extract , correspond approximately 15 Âµmol sulforaphane per tablet . The dose vary 3-8 tablet daily depend upon participant 's weight . Matched placebo tablet contain inert ingredient Participants provide overnight void urine sample prior start treatment end treatment phase quantify sulforaphane metabolite . Clinical response assess clinician- caregiver-rated measure autism symptom ( Social Responsiveness Scale-2 ; Repetitive Behavior Scale- Revised ) , challenge symptom commonly observe individual developmental disability ( Aberrant Behavior Checklist ) , global severity symptom improvement ( Clinical Global Impression Scale ) . A blood sample collect baseline end treatment phase check safety lab store planned future study biomarkers associate treatment response .</detailed_description>
