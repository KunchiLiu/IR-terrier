	<brief_summary>Fall one common cause ill health morbidity old population . In Sweden 300 000 people/year seek emergency treatment due fall 1600 dy . Poor balance control lead sedentary life muscle weakness , fear fall increase risk fall . Balance train physical activity positive effect fall prevention balance , long-term follow-up limited . There also gap proven efficient research perform community clinical setting . Many study report efficacy certain treatment , method training program , often may take year develop , result take clinical practice may take year come daily use . This delay mean gap know consistently do . It importance implement method proven beneficial impact health physical function clinical trial . Furthermore evaluate strategy implementation significance . The aim study implement evidence base balance training clinical practice prevent future fall fall-related injury old adult . The program proven efficient , yet implement community clinical setting . Implementation outcomes include effectiveness , acceptability , feasibility , fidelity , cost sustainability . Outcome variables individual level fall-related concern , balance performance , physical function activity , health relate quality life number fall . The investigator foresee balance training old adult prevent future fall fall related injury , increase physical activity level , health relate quality life provide participant strategy able physically active healthy life style .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>`` Stay Balanced '' - Prevention Falls Older Adults - From Clinical Research Clinical Practice</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project cluster-randomized study compare different implementation strategy . The study comprise clinical setting primary health care ( PHC ) senior residential care . Participating clinic recruit strategically regard catchment area population structure , achieve large diverse participation possible . Participant balance training recruit participate clinic , primary care facility vicinity clinic involve advertisement local paper community . Participants report interest partake study telephone-interview informed project check eligibility . Thereafter , call baseline testing . The investigator plan involve 30 different PHC thereby 360-480 participant balance training ( two group 6-8 participant per semester clinic 2 semester ) . In two previous randomise controlled study perform research group Stockholm county regard group balance-training older adult risk fall investigator receive large number people report interest announcement , i.e . approximately 500 subject . However , exclude verified diagnosis osteoporosis , one inclusion criterion 's two study . The group base balance-training program well described publish ´Rehabilitation practice´- article develop base well-established principle exercise knowledge balance control rely interaction several physiological system , well interaction environmental factor perform task . It include exercise dual- multi task performance , i.e . performance person 's attention divide motor cognitive task , natural component daily activity , may increase risk fall especially old adult . As training adaption specific system trained , program follow principle specificity base exercise target various system postural control aim improve balance performance specific situation occur daily life , regain postural stability perturbation able suddenly avoid obstacle , retain balance , simultaneously walk answer question . Furthermore , progressive exercise perform different level ( basic , moderate , advanced ) , make progressively challenge individual throughout whole program . The training conduct individually tailor group program . The 12-week balance training program perform two time per week one hour . The training lead physiotherapist train leader . After balance training participant get recommendation continue physical activity training , i.e . `` Physical activity prescription '' . For implementation participatory approach use , different setting engage early phase . For evaluation model Proctor et al. , follow . The implementation strategy include 1 ) contract set , 2 ) meeting head set , 3 ) discussion physical therapist leader set , 4 ) education physical therapist leader trainer 5 ) coaching trainer . Implementation outcomes include : - Acceptability evidence-based treatment among health provider assess investigate attitude towards balance program questionnaire , focus group interview . - Feasibility extent new treatment successfully use carried clinical setting assess investigating balance program fit clinical practice focus group interview . - Fidelity include five dimension , i.e . adherence program protocol , quality delivery , program component differentiation , exposure intervention participant responsiveness program investigate observation , check-lists assessment individual level ( see ) . - Cost assess health economic evaluation program . - Sustainability assess use quantitative qualitative method include measure compliance/fidelity train program . Assessments individual level include fall-related concern , health relate quality life , balance performance , gait , physical activity , muscle strength low extremity number fall compliance training . The assessment individual level perform PHC regular physiotherapist . All participant assess training period ( 3 month inclusion ) three six , twelve eight-teen twenty-four month , i.e . two year inclusion . During follow-up period , i.e . three , six , twelve , eight-teen twenty-four month , assessment consist sms-track system postal survey questionnaire regard fall-related concern , heath relate quality life , physical activity adherence training regime .</detailed_description>
