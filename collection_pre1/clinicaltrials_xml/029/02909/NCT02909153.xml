	<brief_title>Study Intraperitoneal Triferic Patients Chronic Peritoneal Dialysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase 1 , open-label , dose escalation study assess pharmacokinetic ( PK ) profile , maximum concentration ( Cmax ) Area Under Concentration Time Curve ( AUC0-t ) Triferic iron administer intraperitoneally chronic kidney disease patient peritoneal dialysis ( Continuous Cycling Peritoneal Dialysis ( CCPD ) Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis ( CAPD ) ) . Screening 4 week , enrollment period approximately one week . There two treatment ( dose ) visit one follow-up visit enrollment period . At treatment visit , patient randomly assign receive either single ascending dose Triferic administer intraperitoneal ( IP ) long ( 12 hour ) peritoneal dialysis dwell single 6.6 mg dose Triferic administer IV 4 hour . Blood sample obtain define time 12 hour establish total serum iron PK IP Triferic well clinical serum iron profile . The IP dose first Cohort 5 mg Triferic iron/liter IP . Subsequent Cohort IP dose 12.5 mg Triferic iron/liter , 20 mg Triferic iron/liter , final Cohort dose determine ( TBD ) . The IV dose 6.6. mg Cohorts . Six patient enrolled Cohort , enrollment subsequent ( high dose ) Cohort initiate completion evaluation previous ( low dose ) Cohort .</detailed_description>
