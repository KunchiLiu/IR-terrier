	<brief_summary>Physical activity important factor understanding disease affect child . Decreases physical activity sometimes first thing happen child diagnosed disease . When child see doctor , visit reflect single point time . It capture child feel day visit doctor . This study plan use special monitor call actigraphs collect information physical activity child type disease call pulmonary hypertension . This study measure active child compare activity clinical information actigraphy measurement child without pulmonary hypertension .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Actigraphy Pediatric Pulmonary Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pediatric pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) ( roughly 1-5 case per 1 million child ) severe disorder high mortality morbidity , limited treatment option . Pediatric PAH define adult , presence abnormally high pulmonary artery pressure . In comparison adult , pediatric PAH likely severe disorder high mortality morbidity without treatment . Except INOmax persistent pulmonary hypertension newborn , drug currently approve US treat pediatric PAH patient 1-17 year age . Drug development treat pediatric PAH unmet public health need child priority Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . However , study address safety efficacy PAH therapy rare , part due lack suitable clinical endpoint quantitative qualitative measure disease severity . A major limitation towards enhance outcome child PAH lack pediatric efficacy endpoint surrogate measure capable reproducibly reliably reflect change pulmonary arterial pressure response therapeutic intervention assess pediatric clinical trial . Children often young developmentally unable perform standard cardiopulmonary exercise test use several metric accurate reflect clinical status child adult , 6 minute walk distance . Additionally , use cardiac catheterization directly measure pulmonary vascular resistance invasive , require anesthesia , additional risk complication . Therefore , address critical unmet medical need child PAH , propose begin develop novel , developmentally-appropriate non-invasive endpoint child use actigraphy . Actigraphy mobile device directly , reproducibly non-invasively measure physical activity , readily assess ambulatory setting , may provide novel , simple inexpensive approach . Impaired exercise tolerance prominent feature PAH contribute significantly reduce quality life . Assessing exercise capacity integral part clinical evaluation PAH adult use 6 minute walk distance ( 6MWD ) common primary endpoint adult PAH clinical trial . Importantly , 6MWD test exist exercise performance test readily apply adult study reliable applicable young child infant . We propose actigraphy may provide novel endpoint assess drug efficacy child proven strongly predictive reflect clinical course outcomes child PAH . If successful , early study great potential significant regulatory impact advance public health mission , actigraphy could possibly become endpoint would accept pediatrics regulatory standard PAH clinical trial . The purpose current study describe use actigraphy child PAH determine correlation exist actigraphy data clinical data child PAH .</detailed_description>
