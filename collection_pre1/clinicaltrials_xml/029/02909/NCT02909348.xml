	<brief_summary>There new form cancer treatment call immunotherapy attack cancer directly work immune system make effective . This type treatment may side effect call autoimmune side effect cause immune system attack normal part body . At moment doctor predict patient may risk develop autoimmune side effect doctor also predict patient likely benefit . This study analyse blood sample patient receive immunotherapy see marker identify help make prediction .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immunophenotyping Melanoma Patients Treatment With Pembrolizumab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Immunotherapy new approach treat cancer major side effect class autoimmune immune system target . Currently doctor able identify patient higher risk develop autoimmune toxicity doctor able identify patient likely respond treatment . Markers immune system already identify associate naturally occur autoimmune disease . In study investigator examine immune cell patient advance malignant melanoma receive immunotherapy treatment Pembrolizumab see similar immune system marker identify marker may relate development autoimmune side effect response treatment . This would enable good selection patient treatment immunotherapy .</detailed_description>
