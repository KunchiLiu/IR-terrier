	<detailed_description>Of 1.2 million Americans live HIV , half experience neurocognitive impairment ( NCI ) adversely affect daily live predictive increase morbidity mortality . HIV-infected individual addict stimulant drug like cocaine even high risk NCI , contribute impulsive decision making , engage high rate risky behavior associate poor clinical outcome HIV transmission others . Delay discounting , key aspect impulsivity , describes tendency devalue reward delay receipt increase . Individuals addict drug tend prefer small , immediate reward large , delayed reward . Excessive discounting associate wide range health risk behavior , include risky sex . The Competing Neurobehavioral Decision Systems model posit excessive discounting result great relative strength impulsive system executive control system . The investigator ' work suggest HIV infection modulates effect cocaine brain functioning executive control network delay discounting . Prior research support robust association excessive discounting work memory impairment . As core executive function support self-regulation , work memory theoretically intervention target HIV risk reduction . Computerized work memory train show decrease delay discount stimulant user , yet test HIV-infected drug user . The propose R21 study test preliminary efficacy computerized cognitive training program improve work memory reduce delay discount HIV-infected cocaine user . Using randomized trial design , investigator assign 50 participant either experimental cognitive training condition attention-matched control condition . Participants complete 48 session 8 week , assessment baseline , post-training , 1-month follow-up evaluate intervention effect . The investigator hypothesize cognitive training , relative control condition , lead great improvement work memory reduction delay discounting . The investigator also examine change HIV risk behavior ( cocaine use , risky sex , medication adherence ) . Results support R01 application large scale trial rigorously test impact cognitive training HIV-related behavioral clinical outcome . This innovative line research important translational implication HIV clinical practice , include dissemination resource-limited setting neuropsychology specialist . This proposal directly advance high priority topic AIDS-designated funding test novel treatment HIV-associated NCI drug user . By focus high-risk population continue drive HIV transmission , research strong potential improve neurobehavioral function HIV-infected person , ultimately reduce incidence new HIV infection .</detailed_description>
