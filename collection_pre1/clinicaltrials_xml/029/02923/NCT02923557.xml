	<brief_title>Prophylactic Intravesical Chemotherapy Prevent Bladder Recurrence After Nephroureterectomy Primary Upper Tract Urothelial Carcinoma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION Upper tract urothelial carcinoma ( UTUC ) relatively uncommon compare bladder cancer account 5-10 % urothelial carcinoma , estimate annual incidence Western country ~2 case per 100,000 inhabitant . In 17 % case , concurrent bladder cancer present . Recurrence bladder management UTUC occur 22-47 % UTUC patient , compare 2-6 % contralateral upper tract . At institution , report 30.8 % UTUC patient develop intravesical recurrence , line global trend . Generally speak , field cancerization hypothesis intraluminal seed currently two main concept explain multifocality urothelial cancer recurrent bladder tumor . Independent multiclonal tumor development carcinogenic exposure entire urothelial intraluminal implantation follow clonally induce single progenitor cell evolution mechanism suggest . While two mechanism could co-exist , intraluminal seeding hypothesis become prevalent emergence evidence molecular study . Thus postoperative intravesical chemotherapy could potentially remove implantation cell prevent recurrence . While intravesical instillation widely use prevent recurrence transurethral resection primary bladder tumor , still consensus prophylactic capability intravesical chemotherapy prevent bladder recurrence nephroureterctomy UTUC . According previous prospective , multicentre , randomise clinical trial , single postoperative dose intravesical mitomycin C appear reduce risk bladder tumour within first year follow nephroureterectomy UTUCs . AIM OF THE WORK This clinical trial design evaluate efficacy single immediate intravesical chemotherapy instillation prevention bladder recurrence nephroureterectomy UTUCs .</detailed_description>
