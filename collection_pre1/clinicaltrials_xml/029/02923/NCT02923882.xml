To address need , investigator propose locally-made inexpensive prefabricate model `` 100-dollar-kitchen '' ( $ 100Kitchen ) improve cookstove resource-poor setting . The improved cookstove $ 100Kitchen ensure complete incineration biomass fuel thus , provide safeguard pregnant woman use fuel . This study measure impact ' $ 100Kitchen improve cookstove ' intervention whether pregnant woman reside household ' $ 100Kitchen improve cookstove ' less likely give birth LBW newborn .
