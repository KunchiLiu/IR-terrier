	<detailed_description>Sarcopenia common complication chronic kidney disease . Sarcopenia define decreased muscle mass function central frailty phenotype associate disability , hospitalization , death . Sarcopenia common devastate complication chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) . The investigator others demonstrate high prevalence physical frailty among CKD patient treat dialysis . Furthermore investigator demonstrate great 30 % impairment low extremity physical performance measure person CKD compare predict value . The age demographic among CKD patient result substantial U.S. public health burden attributable sarcopenia . In year 2000 , direct healthcare cost attributable sarcopenia U.S. were18.5 billion . Sarcopenia associate adverse health-related outcome . Sarcopenia old adult consistently link decreased physical functioning , disability , fall , hospitalization , mortality . Impaired low extremity physical performance , measure objective testing , associate all-cause mortality CKD patient treat dialysis association strong magnitude traditional risk factor . Skeletal muscle major site peripheral glucose utilization ameliorate oxidative stress endothelial injury associate acute post-prandial hyperglycemia . Through mechanism sarcopenia may contribute metabolic disturbance insulin resistance , oxidative stress , endothelial dysfunction lead cardiovascular disease . Mitochondrial dysfunction central skeletal muscle dysfunction . Skeletal muscle mitochondrion necessary efficient generation energy ( ATP ) oxygen normal lipid metabolism . Under normal condition , muscle efficiently utilizes majority supply oxygen 0.2 % mitochondrial oxygen shuttle reactive oxidative specie ( ROS ) . Under pathologic situation uncouple oxygen consumption ATP generation result increased oxygen consumption decrease ATP production process lead increase ROS oxidative stress . Uncoupling oxygen ATP generation directly affect skeletal muscle function . Decreased efficiency ATP generation link decreased muscle strength recently associate decreased gait speed old adult . Magnetic resonance spectroscopy optical spectroscopy ( MRS/OS ) provide novel , non-invasive real-time insight human skeletal muscle mitochondrial function . MRS/OS novel technique measure maximal mitochondrial ATP production in-vivo follow acute bout ischemia induce exercise use phosphorous MRS ( 31P MRS ) . The rate recovery phosphocreatinine cessation exercise use characterize rate aerobic mitochondrial ATP resynthesis basal anaerobic glycolytic ATP production . By combine technique optical spectroscopy post-exercise measure transport oxygen hemoglobin myoglobin within muscle investigator able accurately determine ratio couple efficiency ATP generation per unit oxygen consumption . Skeletal muscle mitochondrial dysfunction measure ATP generate capacity couple efficiency associate process age insulin resistance . Furthermore study healthy subject show muscle performance fatigue link ability resynthesize ATP rather lactate concentration . Preliminary MRS/OS finding suggest profoundly alter mitochondrial function CKD patient . Previous experimental study suggest uremia dialysis patient affect skeletal muscle structure mitochondrial function . Oxidative damage highly prevalent CKD , evidence increased biomarkers oxidative stress change glutathione , important antioxidant . Prior small study non-diabetic CKD patient suggest impairment ex-vivo mitochondrial function reduction mitochondrial enzyme activity . Based finding investigator use novel , non-invasive , functional MRS/OS assay characterize in-vivo mitochondrial function . Preliminary finding non-diabetic CKD patient indicate markedly reduce ATP oxygen ratio compare control . This finding suggest alter mitochondrial energetics candidate central mechanism link metabolic derangement impaired physical function CKD , motivate hypothesis mitochondrial dysfunction associate oxidative stress , insulin resistance impair physical functioning CKD . Exercise may ameliorate mitochondrial dysfunction , insulin resistance physical functioning CKD . Studies exercise non-CKD patient diabetes insulin resistance demonstrate exercise-induced improvement mitochondrial biogenesis link improved insulin sensitivity well decrease mitochondrial oxidative stress . Animal study suggest exercise stimulates autophagy result removal defective inefficient mitochondrial lead healthy mitochondrial network improve insulin sensitivity.The primary goal study investigate impact combine resistance aerobic exercise skeletal muscle dysfunction . Given investigator 's preliminary data demonstrate strong association sarcopenia mortality CKD , effective intervention impact physical function urgently need improve patient health outcome .</detailed_description>
