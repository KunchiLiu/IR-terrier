	<brief_summary>Stroke rehabilitation hemiplegic primarily lie motor control training activity daily life . Whole body aerobics much less emphasized . Nonetheless , cardiopulmonary fitness even ambulatory hemiparetics half compare healthy people , prone deconditioning . The present study aim understand efficacy aerobic training addition usual neuro-rehabilitation , include aerobic fitness , daily activity dependency , anti-inflammation anti-thrombosis . This prospective randomized design . The subject recruit hospitalized patient rehabilitation ward Chang Gung Memorial Hospital Linkuo . 120 hemiplegic patient due stroke enrolled randomize two group : combine training ( CT ) usual rehabilitation . Participants CT receive aerobics moderate intensity addition usual rehabilitation . The program 35 minutes/session , 5 sessions/week 4-5 week total . A constant-power semi-recumbent stepper employ training modality . It use bilateral reciprocal movement arm couple opposite leg , allow push pull motion . Additional 20 healthy participant also recruit healthy control . Assessment train include : ( I ) grade cardiopulmonary exercise test use constant-load stepper . ( II ) Functional Independence Measure . ( III ) coagulation system assessment , use Thrombin generation assay Ceveron alpha ( Technoclone GmbH , Vienna , Austria ) : Von Willebrand factor , tissue plasminogen activator , plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 , D-dimer , factor VIII , etc . [ 1st year ] ; ( IV ) monocyte-platelet aggregation subtypes , use flow cytometry [ 2nd year ] . ( V ) systemic inflammation , platelet activation prognostic biomarker：C-reactive protein , soluble P-selectin , asymmetric dimethylarginine , Lipoprotein-Associated Phospholipase A2 , etc [ 3rd year ] . Statistical analysis use ANOVA post-hoc , two-way repeated measure ANOVA , etc . The investigation start approval end 2019 , July . We hope investigation establish comprehensive rehabilitation program clinical application .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stepper Aerobic Training Fitness , Disability , Inflammation Thrombosis Stroke Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Taiwan , 220,00 stroke survivor year , 10,000 new suffers cause impairment daily activity . This lead cause disability consume 4.5 billion National Health Insurance yearly . More half become hemi-paretics hemi-plegics . Stroke lead adverse combination reduce functional capacity increase energy demand perform routine activity Thereby , physiologic fitness reserve diminish . Aerobic fitness low stroke survivor . Among ambulatory patient suffer hemiparetic stroke , VO2peak approximately half age-matched individual , level near minimum range require activity daily life . It may limit ability perform everyday activity cause complication , cardiopulmonary de-conditioning , muscular atrophy , joint stiffness , even learn nonuse . Many patient discharge neurorehabilitation focus motor control ADL ( activity daily life ) training , aerobic fitness training neglect , especially non-ambulatory patient . Randomized exercise training study use wide variety modality protocols demonstrate 8~23 % improvement VO2peak 2-6 month train . However , research recruit patient hemiparesis mild-to-moderate gait impairment . No specific training protocol adequately study suggested hemiplegic patient . It difficult partake aerobic exercise , like walk biking . There need develop new aerobic exercise module suitable patient , especially ambulation difficulty result severe paralysis . In current investigation , semi-recumbent stepper constant power design adopt training modality . It accommodate motor function deficit provide trunk distal limb support . In addition , semi- recumbent stepper use bilateral reciprocal movement arm couple opposite leg , allow push pull motion . Aerobic fitness training propose beneficial approach people stroke . Taking part fitness training could range benefit important people stroke improve cognitive function , improve mood , quality life , could reduce risk recurrent stroke . In present investigation , outcome measurement include cardiopulmonary fitness degree daily activity dependency , also prognostic biomarkers , thrombotic inflammatory state . It well-documented exercise training anti-thrombotic effect . Increased physical activity cardiorespiratory fitness associate reduce risk fatality cardiovascular disease . Moreover , increase study demonstrate regular moderate-intensity physical activity associate health benefit , even aerobic fitness ( e.g. , maximal oxygen uptake , VO2max ) remain unchanged . For sedentary person risk cardiovascular disease , adopt moderately active lifestyle induce important health benefit , reduce prothrombotic factor lipid peroxidation , increase fibrinolytic activity high-density lipoprotein level , etc . One present investigation aim understand whether 20~25 session aerobic train moderate intensity induce favorable adaptation could contribute decrease risk ischemic event . This prospective randomized control study . Eighty stroke sufferer unilateral weakness enrol Chang Gung Memorial Hospital Linkuo . They randomize two group : combine training ( CT ) usual rehabilitation ( UR ) . Participants CT group receive supervise aerobic training moderate intensity addition usual neuro-rehabilitation , motor control task-oriented ADL training major content . Patients UR undergo usual neuro-rehabilitation . The aim present research evaluate efficacy aerobic training program moderate intensity total 20~25 session use semi-recumbent stepper constant power design . Pre- post-training measurement include ( I ) cardiopulmonary fitness , ( II ) daily activity dependency , ( III ) coagulation fibrinolysis profile . [ 1st year ] ( IV ) monocyte subset interaction platelet [ 2nd year ] . ( V ) Systemic inflammation , platelet activation prognostic biomarker：C-reactive protein , soluble P-selectin , asymmetric dimethylarginine , Lipoprotein-Associated Phospholipase A2 , etc . [ 3rd year ] . Venous blood sample two time rehabilitation . Hopefully , clinical investigation establish model incorporate aerobics hemiplegic patient follow stroke , efficacy clinical application .</detailed_description>
