	<detailed_description>In propose study plan recruit presbyope ( people might significant loss ability accommodate crystalline lens eye ) wear test lens perform typical clinical test visual acuity different luminance level view distances/angles . These similar typical examination conduct regular contact lens wearer . Results test used evaluate efficacy test lenses provide additional information revision test lens . If show provide adequate eye comfort intend vision correction , lens design potential allow ten million presbyope adapt contact lenses significantly improve vision well-being .</detailed_description>
