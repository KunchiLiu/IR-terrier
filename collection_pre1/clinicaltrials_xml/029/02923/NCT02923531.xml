	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine combination X4P-001 plus nivolumab safe tolerable . Secondly , study investigate add X4P-001 nivolumab treatment effect body cancer tumor , patient receive nivolumab exhibit radiological response .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Addition X4P-001 Nivolumab Treatment Patients With Renal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment immune checkpoint inhibitor , nivolumab , may result generation anti-tumor immune response . However , objective radiological response advance RCC patient 21.5 % . Therefore , important identify additional therapy could augment anti-tumor immune activity checkpoint inhibitor , result increase number patient able achieve radiological response treatment . While checkpoint inhibitor facilitate activation cytotoxic T cell , agent impact T cell traffic . X4P-001 , CXCR4 antagonist , hypothesize impact traffic immune cell type , example , decrease myeloid-derived suppressor cell increase cytotoxic T cell tumor . Giving X4P-001 treatment combination nivolumab hypothesized increase clinical response provide influx T cell activate checkpoint inhibitor . Additionally , CXCR4 play role traffic endothelial progenitor cell mediate angiogenesis . RCC known responsive anti-angiogenic agent , thus X4P-001 target second mechanism tumor growth inhibition .</detailed_description>
