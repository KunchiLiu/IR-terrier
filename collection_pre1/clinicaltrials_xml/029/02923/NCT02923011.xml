	<brief_summary>Osteoid osteoma painful , benign bone tumor occur frequently young male age 10 20 year . The goal propose study base premise MRgFUS noninferior CT-guided radiofrequency ablation ( CTgRFA ) , term pain reduction follow treatment osteoid osteoma , offer possible improvement regard 1 ) post-procedural pain , 2 ) clinical resource utilization , 3 ) patient experience , and/or 4 ) adverse event . The data current study would provide clinician important information decide treatment option ablation osteoid osteoma .</brief_summary>
