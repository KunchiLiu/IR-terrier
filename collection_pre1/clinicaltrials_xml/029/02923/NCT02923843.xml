	<detailed_description>Frailty multimorbidity one big challenge today health care due demographic development elderly survive many disease mortal decade ago . Health care Sweden one best world , yet many frail old people receive appropriate health care . Several report describe fragment care lack good quality due lack holistic view patient situation . At time care give costly ineffective lack continuity . Additionally , lack hospital bed Sweden due age population cut bed last decade . There though method , Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment ( CGA ) , study show many benefit older patient include less need hospital bed , good functional outcome well chance live home Acute Hospital Discharge , method much use Sweden . The aim study show CGA Out-patient Care Setting save hospital bed without decrease quality care measure sustain functional capacity . Other parameter evaluate mortality , degree frailty , health economy , quality life , cognition . Survey field Frailty become central concept elderly research recent year . A common definition state decrease reserve resistance stressor result cumulative decline across multiple physiological system , cause vulnerability different outcome , fall , hospitalization , institutionalization mortality . The prevalence frailty increase age frail old people risk deterioration need acknowledge . The Swedish National Board Health Welfare give priority development use target need assessment frail old people . Assessments comprehensive person-centred require achieve satisfactory appropriate care old people complex need . Frailty dynamic condition , conceptualize continuum frail , pre-frail , frail . Those consider pre-frail likely non-frail develop full frailty specific intervention implement . Appropriate nutrition exercise suggest first-line treatment frailty treatment consider depend individual cause frailty . The goal identify need provide support help old people independent daily live possible . Previous research find intervention include CGA result functional benefit frail old patient include good chance living home acute hospital care-period . CGA involve multidimensional team approach assess medical , functional , psychosocial environmental need . Several study imply less need hospital bed few readmission care give accord CGA . As substantial lack hospital bed Sweden , result patient placed corridor , hazardous discharge problem work environment , would important find intervention could save hospital bed give good care patient . As frailty address care base CGA important detect frailty , also avoid use complex CGA need . A recent review show frail elderly benefit CGA mixed population elderly . There unfortunately easy overall accept instrument detect frailty . In research criterion develop Fried frequently use - resource-demanding seldom use outside academic research . Another easy accessible method develop Rockwood choose The International Consortium Health Outcomes Measurement ( ICHOM ) prefer instrument detect measure frailty . The instrument well know clinical practise Sweden , could interest test whether applicable Swedish Health Care . There study CGA Out-patient Care - one recent randomize control study conduct Sweden 2011-2013 show nearly 30 % reduction need day hospital similar reduction mortality three year randomization . The investigator would therefore perform similar study slightly different population base experience former Swedish study order see whether result reproducible another health care set Sweden . Methods This project single-centre trial base Helsingborg Hospital . Participants meet inclusion criterion identify special register ER able detect patient visit ER several time within specified period . The register manage administrator without couple research project . The ER administrator every month send list possible participant research nurse . She control list exclusion-criteria ( live nursing home outside near municipality Helsingborg Hospital ) . All remain possible participant receive letter invitation explain purpose study study protocol . Within seven day send letter subject contact telephone verbal inform consent book appointment home information , write consent baseline assessment study nurse . If old person due cognitive decline unable answer study question give informed consent , proxy contact . Those accept participate randomize computer-generated number two study arm : intervention control group . This information keep randomisation master list power number participant ( 450 ) research administrator . When write informed consent give baseline assessment do , visit study nurse contact administrator give patient randomisation number consecutively accord master list . A letter sent within week inform patient group allocate . The intervention : After baseline assessment intervention group receive interdisciplinary assessment base CGA , tailor participant 24 month . The first visit either hospital patient 's home , depend participant 's condition ability travel . The multidisciplinary team consist physician , nurse , pharmacist , physiotherapist occupational therapist access competence need . The team work accord CGA , primary continue responsibility patient study period 24 month . The CGA person-centered unique patient , base core element socio-demographic background , social network , health medical history , medication , functional status , cognitive status , nutritional status , somatic status psychosocial status include depression , provide comprehensive assessment tailor person . Structured questionnaire validate measure use . The team able give proactive care base CGA collaboration primary care municipality . The relative involve possible . The intensity follow-up depend participant ' need . Usual care ( control group ) Participants allocate control group receive health care general practitioner , community service in- outpatient hospital care . Both intervention control group access primary care center , hospital ambulatory equal condition . Follow ups outcome measure perform old person 's home 12 24 month inclusion . Sample size A power calculation make , base primary outcome variable , number day hospital . Based former similar study slightly young population assume difference intervention group control group 4,1 day hospital 24 month ( 11,1 day intervention group 15,2 control group ) standard deviation 15 day group . To able detect difference intervention control group two-sided test significance level α=0.05 80 % power , least 211 participant group need . There almost loss follow-up outcome base previous research patient-group intervention , total 450 person include . Statistical analysis : Both descriptive analytic statistic use , order compare group analyse change time . Non-parametric statistic use ordinal data analyse . Otherwise , parametric statistic use . Besides descriptive statistic , chi2 Fisher 's 2-tailed exact test use test difference proportion group , odds ratio ( OR ) use compare outcomes group . A value p &lt; 0.05 ( 2-sided ) consider significant . The analysis make basis intention-to-treat principle . Given old age participant , relatively high drop-out rate inevitable , miss data random . Simply analyze complete case relevant might lead bias . Therefore , approach data imputation replacement miss value value base median change deterioration baseline follow-up participate follow-up . The reason imputation method 1 ) study sample ( frail old people ) expect deteriorate time natural course age process 2 ) reason fulfil follow-up often deteriorate health . Worst-case change apply died follow-up . An interim-analysis make primary outcome mortality one year independent researcher . Time schedule The planning study complete early autumn 2016 . Recruitment clinical team-members ongoing October 2016 Out-Patient Care Team start work base CGA ready include patient . November 2016 - December 17 Inclusion-period . A preliminary study reveal 50 - 60 eligible patient per month Helsingborg . With attrition rate 30-40 % around 35 patient randomized month . To reach empowered number low inclusion rate summer vacation take 12-14 month include participant study period participant 2 year . January 17 - March 19 Follow outcome measure . August 19 All data collection complete . Quality assurance data do project assistant project leader . August 19 - December 19 : Analysis article writing ( researcher ) , well presentation conference ( professional well researcher ; local , national international , do professional researcher ) .</detailed_description>
