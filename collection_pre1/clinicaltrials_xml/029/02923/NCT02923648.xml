	<detailed_description>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) umbrella diagnosis define obstructive lung function impairment , likely cause multitude etiology include environmental exposure , genetic predisposition developmental factor . Due heterogeneity disease , molecular mechanistic sub-phenotyping COPD represent essential step facilitate development relevant diagnostic treatment option constantly grow patient group . Obstructive lung disease increase global health problem pandemic proportion , COPD alone affect &gt; 10 % population , predict WHO become 5th leading cause morbidity disability worldwide year 2020 . Smoking main well study risk factor develop COPD . However , chronic airway obstruction also never-smoking population recently recognize increase health problem : An estimated 10 % patient diagnose COPD never smoke , represent 1 % general public . Low birth weight premature birth represent important risk factor develop pulmonary obstruction adulthood . Particularly prematurely bear child bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD ) , define need oxygen therapy 28th day life child bear prior gestational week 32 , increase incidence airway obstruction hyper-reactivity , represent major risk factor develop COPD , asthma , later life . The purpose LUNAPRE study perform in-depth clinical molecular characterization lung survivor BPD enter adulthood , compare profile relevant control group . The study encompass profile epigenetic alteration , mRNA , miRNA , proteome , metabolomes lipid mediator multiple lung compartment ( airway epithelium , alveolar macrophage , exosomes , bronchoalveolar exudate ) use range 'omics platform , combination extensive clinical phenotyping prematurely born subject with- without BPD neonatal period enter adulthood , well healthy subject mild asthma born term . The primary objective study identify molecular alteration persist adulthood relate early onset obstructive lung disease , specifically correlate clinical phenotype multi-molecular 'omics profile several lung compartment study group . Secondary goal involve identification subset prognostic/diagnostic biomarkers classification define subgroup , well relevant pharmaceutical target .</detailed_description>
