	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study side effect talimogene laherparepvec radiation therapy see well work treat patient newly diagnose soft tissue sarcoma remove surgery . Biological therapy , talimogene laherparepvec , use substance make live organism may stimulate suppress immune system different way stop cancer cell grow . Radiation therapy use high energy x-ray , photon . electron , proton kill tumor cell shrink tumor . Giving talimogene laherparepvec radiation therapy may work well treat patient soft tissue sarcoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Talimogene Laherparepvec Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Soft Tissue Sarcoma That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine pathologic complete response rate ( number patient &gt; = 95 % necrosis divide number evaluable patient ) follow preoperative treatment talimogene laherparepvec ( T-VEC ) combination radiation patient localize soft tissue sarcoma include pre-planned safety analysis . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine toxicity T-VEC combination radiation localize soft tissue sarcoma , neo-adjuvant treatment post-surgical resection wound complication . II . To determine rate radiologic response , prior surgery , extent surgical resection . III . To estimate time surgery , time progression , time recurrence , death . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To characterize clinical outcome within three distinct histologic subtypes : liposarcoma , leiomyosarcoma undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma . II . To characterize percentage tumor necrosis treat tumor . III . To determine combination preoperative T-VEC radiation increase expression PD-L1 soft tissue sarcoma . IV . To determine impact preoperative T-VEC radiation tumor infiltrate circulate immune cell patient soft tissue sarcoma . OUTLINE : Patients receive talimogene laherparepvec intratumorally ( IT ) week 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 , 11 . Beginning 8-10 day start talimogene laherparepvec , patient undergo radiation therapy week 2-6 . After completion study treatment , patient follow 60 day , every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 1 year , every year 5 year .</detailed_description>
