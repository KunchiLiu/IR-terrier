	<brief_summary>The three tumour stream study protocol : ( ) upper GI malignancy ( comprise intra-hepatic/extra-hepatic cholangiocarcinomas , gall bladder cancer duodenal cancer ) . ) ; ( ii ) neuroendocrine tumour ( inc. Pancreatic , bronchial intestinal carcinoid tumour ) ( iii ) rare gynaecological tumour ( include limit : vaginal vulval carcinoma , clear cell carcinoma ovary , low grade serous ovarian cancer , mixed mullarian tumour ( carcinosarcoma ) , sarcomas female genital tract granulosa cell tumour ) . The role immunotherapy define common cancer type , however rarity , efficacy immunotherapy cancer poorly define . This protocol provide important opportunity establish whether combination nivolumab &amp; ipilimumab efficacy cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II Trial Ipilimumab Nivolumab Treatment Rare Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase 2 clinical trial nivolumab combine ipilimumab subject rare cancer . This study allow evaluation clinical benefit , measure progression free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) , provide nivolumab combine ipilimumab . If safety profile acceptable clinically efficacy see , study would support use nivolumab combine ipilimumab subject cancer . Study Rationale Clinically advance rare cancer pose significant clinical challenge evidence base treatment seldom available patient suffer malignancy . Despite little evidence show clinical benefit , patient often treat chemotherapeutic agent use patient common malignancy arise anatomical site . Furthermore , small number , often exclude clinical trial new agent . The rare care project define rare malignancy cancer incidence less 6/100000/year . It estimate 42,000 people diagnosed form rare less common cancer Australia every year ( www.canceraustralia.gov.au ) . The cancer specific survival patient diagnose rare malignancy significantly low common cancer highlight need improve management treatment patient . Given recent success cancer immunotherapy checkpoint regulator ipilimumab nivolumab whole range different cancer type , postulate agent could beneficial rare cancer improve overall outlook patient condition . It propose patient cohort fall within three distinct tumour stream examine , patient receive ipilimumab nivolumab combination immunotherapy . The three tumour stream define : upper GI malignancy ( comprise intra-hepatic/ extra-hepatic cholangiocarcinomas , gall bladder cancer duodenal cancer ) . ) ; neuroendocrine tumour ( inc. Pancreatic , bronchial intestinal carcinoid tumour ) rare gynaecological tumour ( include limit : vaginal vulval carcinoma , clear cell carcinoma ovary , low grade serous ovarian cancer , mixed mullarian tumour ( carcinosarcoma ) , sarcomas female genital tract granulosa cell tumour ) . Although overall response rate individual tumour type establish due sample size ( target 20 patient per tumour stream , n=60 total ) , descriptive information individual patient response guide immune-directed therapy responsive rare tumour type may broaden tumour stream .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Signed Written Informed Consent Subjects must willing able comply schedule visit , treatment schedule , laboratory testing , requirement study 2 . Target Population Histologically confirm Upper GI malignancy ( Cholangiocarcinoma/ duodenal carcinoma collect MSI ( microsatellite instability ) status ) ; Neuroendocrine tumour ( inc. pancreatic , bronchial intestinal carcinoid tumour ) Rare Gynaecological tumour ( include limit : vaginal vulval carcinoma , clear cell carcinoma ovary , low grade serous ovarian cancer , mixed Mullarian tumour ( carcinosarcoma ) , sarcomas female genital tract granulosa cell tumour ) . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 1 Prior systemic therapy permit complete least 4 week prior enrolment , related adverse event either return baseline stabilize subject suitable , decline establish standard therapy . Prior radiotherapy must complete least 2 week prior study drug administration . Measurable disease CT MRI per RECIST 1.1 criterion Tumour tissue unresectable metastatic site disease must provide biomarker analysis . If insufficient amount tumour tissue unresectable metastatic site available prior start screen phase , subject must consent allow acquisition additional tumour tissue performance biomarker analyse . Screening laboratory value must meet follow criterion obtain within 14 day prior randomization : WBC ( white blood cell ) &gt; = 2000/μL Neutrophils &gt; = 1500/μL Platelets &gt; = 100 x103/μL Hemoglobin &gt; 9.0 g/dL Serum creatinine &lt; = 1.5 x ULN creatinine clearance ( CrCl ) 40 mL/min ( use CockcroftGault formula ) AST/ALT ( aspartate transaminase/alanine transaminase ) &lt; = 3 x ULN Total Bilirubin &lt; = 1.5 x ULN ( Upper limit normal ) ( except subject Gilbert Syndrome , total bilirubin &lt; 3.0 mg/dL ) . Subject Reenrolment : This study permit reenrolment subject discontinue study pretreatment failure ( i.e . subject treat ) obtain agreement medical monitor prior enrolling subject . If reenrolled , subject must reconsented . 3 . Age Reproductive Status Men woman , &gt; = 18 year age Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must use method ( ) contraception . WOCBP therefore use adequate method avoid pregnancy 23 week ( 30 day plus time require Nivolumab undergo five half life ) last dose investigational drug . Women must negative serum urine pregnancy test ( minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L equivalent unit HCG ) within 24 hour prior start investigational product . Women must breastfeed Men sexually active WOCBP must use contraceptive method failure rate le 1 percent per year . Men sexually active WOCBP must follow instruction birth control half life investigational drug great 24 hour , contraception continue period 90 day plus time required investigational drug undergo five half life . The half life nivolumab ipilimumab 25 day 18 day , respectively . Given blind nature study , men sexually active WOCBP must continue contraception 31 week ( 90 day plus time require nivolumab undergo five half life ) last dose investigational drug . Women childbearing potential ( i.e . postmenopausal surgically sterile azoospermic men require contraception . 1 . Target Disease Exceptions Active brain metastasis leptomeningeal metastasis . Subjects brain metastasis eligible treated magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI except contraindicate CT scan acceptable ) evidence progression least 8 week treatment complete within 28 day prior first dose study drug administration . Cases discuss medical monitor . There must also requirement immunosuppressive dos systemic corticosteroid ( &gt; 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent ) least 2 week prior study drug administration . 2 . Medical History Concurrent Diseases Prior combination treatment direct PD1/PDL1 ( Programmed Death Ligand 1 ) axis ( anti PD 1 , anti PDL1 , anti PD L2 ) , anti CTLA 4 antibody . Prior monotherapy agent immunestimulating/regulating agent permit . Any serious uncontrolled medical disorder , opinion investigator , may increase risk associate study participation study drug administration , impair ability subject receive protocol therapy , interfere interpretation study result . Prior malignancy active within previous 3 year except locally curable cancer apparently cure , basal squamous cell skin cancer , superficial bladder cancer , carcinoma situ prostate , cervix , breast . Subjects active , know suspected autoimmune disease . Subjects vitiligo , type I diabetes mellitus , residual hypothyroidism due autoimmune condition require hormone replacement , psoriasis require systemic treatment , condition expect recur absence external trigger permit enroll . Subjects condition require systemic treatment either corticosteroid ( &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent ) immunosuppressive medication within 14 day study drug administration . Inhaled topical steroid , adrenal replacement dos &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent permit absence active autoimmune disease . 3 . Physical Laboratory Test Findings Any positive test result hepatitis B virus hepatitis C virus indicate acute chronic infection Known history test positive human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) know acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . 4 .
