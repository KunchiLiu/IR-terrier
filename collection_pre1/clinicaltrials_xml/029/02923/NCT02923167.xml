	<detailed_description>Participants assess 3 time - training robot , well 4 week train completion . All test training do Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital include : Clinical test : - A physical examination investigator measure range motion muscular strength shoulder , elbow , forearm , wrist , finger participant . - A test ass spasticity shoulder ; elbow ; forearm , wrist . - A test evaluate movement range , accuracy , dexterity fluency specific task . - A test ass unilateral gross manual dexterity . - A test ass quality life ( social wellbeing acceptance , feeling functioning , participation physical health , emotional wellbeing self-esteem , access service , pain impact disability , family health ) . Muscle activity test : â€¢ A test get detail measure well participant perform movement . The measure collect include movement finger , hand , arm pick different object . This do attach small reflective marker finger , hand , arm participant special camera room film movement marker . Special sensor ( call EMG ) attach hand arm tell investigator muscle turn move . Training Robot : 18 time - 4 time per week within 7 week . The training do train study staff . The robot provide help movement participant move finger control computer game . The assistance provide robot adjust ability participant use hand . Each training session last 1 hour . This include 20 minute stretch , setup , warm-up . Rest breaks request whenever need . The investigator closely monitor subject testing .</detailed_description>
