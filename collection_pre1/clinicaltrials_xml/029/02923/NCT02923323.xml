	<detailed_description>An inter-disciplinary repeated measure case control design study propose , whereby novel method brain imaging , brain electrophysiological activity , neuropsychological test examine concert child 's dynamic change glucose level . This compare healthy population . Study population Participants T1DM healthy sibling recruit research publication diabetes mellitus forum , Pediatric Endocrinology Association . It include mainly participant Pediatric Diabetes Mellitus Clinics Assaf Harofeh ; however , every child complies inclusion exclusion criterion recruit . Inclusion criterion : Families live area high access medical care . Age : 12-18 year old diagnose T1DM longer 2 year . Exclusions : head injury , epileptic episode , psychiatric medication , lack Hebrew ability , disagreement keep study request , history one episode severe hypoglycemic event past , include loss consciousness one episode diabetic ketoacidosis ( DKA ) . Patients significant renal liver function abnormality exclude . Similar exclusion criterion healthy control population . All parent sign inform consent child assent , accord Ethics committee regulation , prior begin study session . Procedures : Study design include 3 session , perform period 2 -12 week , accord participant ' convenience . The data acquire session analyze within group among group order evaluate possible descriptive variable performance difference among diabetic patient addition expect difference healthy diabetic adolescent , expect difference T1DM patient variable glycemic control . Session 1 - baseline visit : Signing parent ' informed consent participant assent . Medical history intake study physician include physical exam . Data regard age diagnosis , DKA diagnosis , history serious hypoglycemic DKA event , management profile , annual average HbA1c , system review , chronic medical disease , medication provide parent , patient summary letter clinical care chart . Physical examination perform include blood pressure , pulse , weight , height , BMI , pubertal stage , injection site . Specialized psychological neurocognitive team perform neurocognitive study one parent participant . Tests perform clinic set order provide baseline cognitive lingual ability continue next study session . Capillary glucose assessment perform prior test ensure glucose &gt; 70 mg/dl . The neurocognitive study include extensive battery cognitive assessment , include task specifically design purpose current project [ Estimation Time task , Continuous Performance Test ( CPT ) , Emotional Stroop eat disorder ( EST-ED ) New object memory task ] . Tasks perform part computer provide task partly hand write task . Session 2 - combine simultaneous EEG CGMS assessment visit , sleep quality assessment : Participants hospitalize 30 hour continuous-EEG unit Pediatric Neurology Department , Assaf-Harofeh Medical Center , undergo 30 hr . continuous simultaneous EEG CGMS monitoring , two separate session neurocognitive assessment glucose &gt; 240 mg/dl glucose &lt; 180 mg/dl , respectively . They arrive EEG unit breakfast day 1 . They connect system accuracy assessment perform lunchtime day 1 . They remain unit , attach system afternoon day 2 , total 30 hour . Neurocognitive assessment perform lunch day 1 , lunch day 2 . On day 1 , receive regular insulin dose lunch , cognitive assessment perform glucose level &gt; 70 mg/dl 180 mg/dl . On day 2 , receive regular insulin dose lunch , cognitive test perform glucose level &gt; 240 mg/dl . An episode food intake without bolus insulin occur unfortunately often among adolescent daily life . The neurocognitive assessment perform session include work memory , selective attention inhibitory control task : Test Memory Learning ( TOMAL ) , selective attention , cognitive flexibility inhibitory control ( cognitive emotional Stroop task ) , word fluency test , visual memory executive function ( ROCF ) ; visuospatial short-term work memory ; auditory verbal learning ; Towers Hanoi , computerize task base Tower London ( TOL ) . number storage capacity work memory well test executive ( WISC-IV ) . During 30 hour participant connect continuous EEG recording , sleep monitoring CGMS . The study participant research team blind EEG reading record . The study team participant blind CGMS record . Participants able convey daily activity room , monitor continuous EEG . They regular diet regular daily activity . Participants carry regular daily routine least 4 blood glucose measurement prick test , insulin management multiple daily injection pump therapy meal . Participants group 3 measure glucose prick test twice daily require CGMS calibration . During 5 consecutive night , include night hospital , participant assess sleep quality sleep diary actigraph . The first night hospital ass association actigraph EEG CGMS variability . The 4 night home assessment CGMS , quality life actigraph reading . Session 3 - brain imaging : MRI scan include T1 , T2 , DTI vascular MRI . All subject undergo anatomic ( T1 , T2 ) scan , DTI scan , vascular scan . The session length 20 -30 minute max . The procedure perform sedation administration , contrast material . Description measure use study : Neurocognitive psychosocial questionnaire task base Continuous EEG monitoring This non-invasive method examination , record electrical cerebral brain activity ( electroencephalographic reading ) continuous prolong period hour day , without cause inconvenience subject . Results high resolution reliability . The patient connect standard digital acquisition EEG machine ( Bio-logic Systems corp , Electro-Cap International Inc , Illinois ) 19 scalp electrode apply accord 10-20 system one cardiac electrode simultaneous electrocardiographic ( ECG ) assessment . The EEG acquisition perform sample rate 256 Hz . The EEG data subject export Matlab environment . Matlab compute language permit efficient analysis data computationally intensive ( The Mathworks Inc , MA ) . Spectral analysis EEG signal perform fast Fourier Transform ( FFT - use MATLAB function ) patient 2 second epochs recording , take 5 minute interval ( fit frequency CGMS measurement ) , resolution 0.5 Hz . The frequency band divide delta ( 0.5-3.5 Hz ) , theta ( 4-7.5 Hz ) , alpha ( 8-13 Hz ) , beta ( 13.5-29.5 Hz ) , low gamma ( 30-47.5 Hz ) high gamma ( 52.5-80 Hz ) . Each participant 3 electrode connect chest see consecutive ECG measurement . continuous glucose monitoring - CGMS The CGMS ( Minimed Inc. , Sylmar . Calif ) portable device allow continuous measurement interstitial glucose concentration ( IGC ) disposable subcutaneous catheter , operate cable monitor system . The system measure glucose value every 10 second store average value every 5 minute , provide 288 measure per day [ 26 ] . The system report value range 40-400 mg/dl ( glucose value low 40 mg/dl report 40 mg/dl value 400 mg/dl report 400 mg/dl ) . The median correlation device capillary glucose 0.92 , 75 % correlation value 0.75 , 96.3 % reference value range &gt; 216 mg/dl accurate . Calibration verification IGC perform prior meal bedtime , accord capillary measure glucose level finger tap , use conventional glucometer . Data download use CGMS solution software , transform Excel datasheet , analyze Pediatric Endocrinologist . Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ( PSQI ) The PSQI well-validated 19-item self-report measure sleep quality adult previous month . The PSQI provide global score sleep quality seven sub scale score . A total score ≥ 5 recommend clinically significant term poor sleep quality . The PSQI demonstrate good validity reliability ( Cronbach 's α &gt; 0.8 ) . Participants complete PSQI session 2 , day 1 , prior wear actigraph . The questionnaire attach appendix 2 . Actigraphy An Actigraph ( Micro-mini-Motion logger , Ambulatory Monitoring Inc. , Ardsley , New York , USA ) wrist-watch size motion detector show highly valid reliable differentiate sleep wakefulness , well record total sleep time ( r=97 compare polysomnography ) . Participants wear actigraph 5 consecutive night nondominant wrist . Sleep pattern estimate use validated Sadeh score algorithm develop adolescent . Actigraph sleep measure include : ( ) sleep onset/ bedtime ; ( b ) sleep offset/wake time , ( c ) time bed ( minute sleep onset sleep offset ) , ( ) actual sleep time ( number sleep minute sleep onset sleep offset ) , ( e ) sleep efficiency ( actual sleep time divide time bed , express percent ) , ( f ) long sleep period ( long consecutive period score sleep without identified awakening ) , ( g ) median number nighttime waking ( least 5 consecutive minute ) , ( h ) median length nighttime wake . Sleep Diary During night participant wear actigraph home , ask rate every day previous night ' sleep use short questionnaire .</detailed_description>
