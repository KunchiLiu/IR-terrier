	<brief_summary>Congenital heart defect see 0,8 % life birth . In France mean 5000 newborn per year . The south-east region France particularly affect result high birth rate consanguinity , compare region . The majority congenital heart diseases remain unexplained . Genetic cause indisputable remain poorly understood . Genetic research need availability large-scale DNA collection , guide robust phenotypic classification . Such DNA-bank create Paris ( CARREG DNA bank , create M3C reference centre congenital heart disease ) . Such bank currently unavailable south-east France . To transport biological specimen Marseille Paris would expensive . In addition , whole infrastructure require correct diagnosis classification congenital heart disease , sample , storage sample genetic analysis , exist AP-HM hospital AMU research unit . For reason highly preferable elaborate database DNA-bank locally . The acronym SEA-HD ( South-EAst-Heart-Diseases ) would use name DNA-bank</brief_summary>
