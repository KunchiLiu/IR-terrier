	<brief_summary>The purpose study ass accuracy utility point-of-care ultrasound ( POCUS ) bladder compare patient 's sensation bladder fullness predict ability successfully perform comprehensive transabdominal pelvic ultrasound pediatric Emergency Department ( ED ) . We hypothesize POCUS accurately quickly determine adequate bladder fullness successfully perform transabdominal pelvic ultrasound patient 's perception bladder fullness .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Ultrasound ( US ) prefer image modality pediatric ED diagnostic evaluation girl suspect pelvic pathology . In transabdominal approach , urine act sonographic acoustic window image adnexa uterus , require full bladder . Many high acuity pelvic pathology present pediatric ED significant morbidity mortality associate delays diagnosis . Despite , diagnostic pelvic US often delay need fill bladder , await patient 's report subjective sensation bladder fullness . Images bladder use POCUS easily obtain bedside emergency physician , provide quick assessment size shape bladder may accurate , objective measure bladder fullness . We aim assess utility POCUS bladder compare patient 's sensation bladder fullness clinical scenario . This pragmatic , randomize control trial convenience sample girl treat pediatric ED present indication transabdominal pelvic US . Patients randomize two group : 1 . Standard care group - Patients give consecutive IV fluid boluses sensation maximum bladder fullness follow transabdominal pelvic US perform radiologist US technician . 2 . Experimental group - Patients give consecutive IV fluid boluses full bladder visualize ED physician POCUS follow transabdominal pelvic US perform radiologist US technician . Patients group assess 30-minute interval sensation bladder fullness 0-4 Likert Scale , total volume IVF give per kilogram , POCUS bladder . Overall time initial order transabdominal pelvic US ( Time 0 ) time patient go successful US record compare two group . Success rate first attempt transabdominal pelvic US also record compare two group .</detailed_description>
