	<detailed_description>Study disease : In 2014 estimate 36.9 million people worldwide live HIV since begin epidemic , 36 million die HIV . There many research strategy underway try reduce devastate effect disease prevent onward transmission , likely range use simultaneously required bring epidemic control . These include development vaccine , microbicide , antiviral treatment agent use prevention . Amongst , HIV neutralise antibody safe infuse intravenously could play important role either post exposure , HIV drive aggressive disease need lower viral load abruptly mother present labour high viral load . The clinical advancement monoclonal antibody hamper inability manufacture specific recombinant protein system would scalable global market . There also valid perception even manufacture possible , would totally unaffordable cost . Thus , neutralise monoclonal antibody MAbs b12 reach efficacy study rhesus macaque . In case monoclonal antibody generally believe cocktail least 3 antibody would necessary avoid viral escape , thereby potentially triple cost product , compare conventional single monoclonal antibody therapeutic . It clear order progress promise anti-HIV monoclonal antibody , new method manufacture need develop . Investigational Medicinal Product ( IMP ) : P2G12 human IgG1 class monoclonal antibody ( MAb ) express tobacco plant ( refer `` P2G12 '' indicate plant origin ) . The parent molecule ( `` 2G12 '' ) one handful MAbs potent neutralise activity HIV produce CHO cell fermentation ( refer `` C2G12 '' indicate CHO-cell origin ) . A number study demonstrate passively infused monoclonal antibody protect intravenous challenge infectious SHIV reagent rhesus macaque . Furthermore , HIV neutralise MAbs affect transmission subsequent disease course vaginal SHIV-challenge macaque In study human , MAb C2G12 safe repeat intravenous infusion asymptomatic HIV-1-infected individual . Similarly , another MAb 4E10 safe intravenous infusion , alone combination MAbs include C2G12 , HIV-1-infected individual These study prepare way introduction MAbs human immunoprophylaxis HIV infection indeed new generation anti-HIV MAbs currently advance prophylactic therapeutic child adult clinical trial child adult With respect MAb 2G12 , number human clinical trial , 4 16 infusion C2G12 give dos range 0.5g 1g alone combination MAbs . The safety result study reassure minimal adverse drug reaction observe . Those report myalgia arthralgia . In recently conduct study , P2G12 safe use administer intravaginally concentration 7 , 14 28mg/ml . Pre-clinical toxicity study IV use ( bolus ) P2G12 complete rat dose 7 35mg/kg ( equivalent 490mg 2.45g 70Kg human respectively ) . No adverse event observe 14 day post-administration , safety concern raise . Study design : This phase 1 , randomise , placebo control , single blind dose escalation study healthy adult volunteer . There three group 6 volunteer receive increase dos MAb 5 receive placebo . The 0.125g dose group one placebo control , 0.25g dose group 0.5g dose group 2 placebo control . The volunteer follow 3 month post dose safety immunogenicity assess . Prior study specific procedure , suitable participant give write information plan procedure schedule . Each volunteer provide sufficient time consider participation study . Any question study answer trained personnel . If volunteer still willing interested ask sign inform consent form ( ICF ) . Participants advise obligation enter trial withdraw time trial , without give reason . A copy sign ICF along copy recent approve Patient Information Sheet ( PIS ) give study participant . An original sign &amp; date consent form retain medical note ( available ) trial note medical note unavailable copy place ISF . To ensure informed consent , volunteer go follow process detail member study team : 1 . Pre-HIV risk assessment discussion 2 . Safe sex counsel 3 . That unknown whether study vaccine protect HIV infection 4 . The level care make available found HIV infect time participation study , include screen period 5 . That , partner continue use reliable form contraception 14 day prior immunisation period 4 month afterwards 6 . That continue use condom sexual partner whose HIV status know 7 . Risk assessment discussion intravenous infusion After ICF collect , assessment investigation undertake accord visit schedule . Participants require make minimum 8 schedule outpatient visit course 20 week . Following informed consent screen visit , demographic , medical history , information contraceptive practice concomitant medication collect safe sex consultation take place . Height , weight temperature record full physical examination perform , vital sign ECG record . Peripheral blood collect follow assess : - Hb , total WBC , neutrophils , lymphocytes platelet - Clotting screen - creatinine , total bilirubin , alkaline phosphatase , AST , ALT glucose - serology HBV ( hepatitis B surface antigen ) , HCV ( hepatitis C antibody ) HIV-1/HIV-2 ( 4th generation HIV antibody/antigen test ) Urinalysis use dipstick protein , ketone , blood , leukocyte esterase , nitrites urine test exclude pregnancy test . Results assessment take place prior administration IMP consider baseline value . Peripheral blood serum collect immunogenicity testing . Medical report request volunteer 's GP confirm eligibility . As soon medical report receive required test result available , review eligibility sign PI . The participant invite receive IMP mutually agreeable date A simple randomisation schedule dose cohort generate use web service . Infusion administer intravenously use infusion pump . Participants blind receive placebo IMP . All patient give study specific 24hrs emergency contact card hour contact detail case emergency . Dosing visit : P2G12 4mg/ml sodium Chloride 0.9 % w/v placebo represent sodium chloride 0.9 % w/v administer total infusion period 30 minute . Both P2G12 placebo infusion clear solution , allow single blinding . The infusion deliver 30 minute continuous monitor throughout time . To ensure IMP remain line investigator flush 50ml sodium chloride 0.9 % w/v upon completion . To ensure participant remain blinded infusion , 50ml sodium chloride 0.9 % w/v flush also give placebo group . Volunteers observe 6 hour post infusion . Participants monitor infusion vital sign record . Vital sign evaluate use study specific Early Warning Score system . In case medical emergency ( e.g . anaphylaxis ) infusion stop immediately action take accordance national guidance UK Resuscitation Council . There delay least 4 hour volunteer dos escalation high dose occur 2 week safety data low dose cohort review trial management group . The maximum number participant receive IMP infusion per day two . Subsequent assessment : Serum collect immunogenicity screening , time 0 ( baseline ) , 1 , 2 , 6 , 24 48 hour , 2 , 4 , 8 12 week weekly 12 week . Time 0 define start infusion . Adverse event assess enrolment visit follow infusion every visit thereafter . Routine laboratory safety parameter urine collect screening , immediately post infusion follow period . ECG vital sign monitor throughout study , Volunteers ask complete diary card 2 week post-injection . Clear instruction provide immunisation visit . Additional visit : Additional visit assessment may require evaluate adverse event , and/or identify diagnosis . Referral independent specialist appropriate expertise arrange uncertainty causal relationship IMP . Data record directly onto participant 's medical note exist participant 's trial note CRFs logical order . Safety information collect report per GCP , casualty assessment adverse event relation IMP also take place . All data handle accordance Data Protection Act 1998 .</detailed_description>
