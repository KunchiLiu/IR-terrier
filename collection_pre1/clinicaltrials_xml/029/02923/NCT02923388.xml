	<brief_title>Neuroprotective Effect Vitamin B12 Vitamin B6 Against Vincristine Induced Peripheral Neuropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ( ALL ) emerge health burden Bangladesh . It anticipate 20 million people go affect annually 2025 country currently developmental transition . Good prognostic outcome ALL relies uninterrupted complete course chemotherapy . About 85 % adult patient 98 % child attain complete recovery full course treatment . One crucial chemotherapeutic agent use treat ALL vincristine . It need complete vincristine adequate dose order get well prognostic outcome . About 45 % patient get vincristine develop deleterious side effect call Vincristine Induced Peripheral Neuropathy ( VIPN ) . Unfortunately , development VIPN result dose reduction , protocol deviation even abandonment treatment vincristine ALL patient . Better prognostic outcome become arcadia . So far , many research conduct explore way prevent treat VIPN . But still conclusive recommendation make . Therefore , VIPN become important issue need address . This study small effort identify potential vitamin B12 vitamin B6 probable preventive measure VIPN . Evidence suggest , vitamin B12 vitamin B6 two water soluble , non toxic vitamin well recognize treatment peripheral neuropathy . Vitamin B12 play fundamental role neurological function . It exert physiological effect mediate two principal enzymatic pathway maintain integrity neuronal membrane . On hand , vitamin B6 pyridoxine essential co- factor various synthesis pathway include synthesis myelin sheath . Patients randomly allocate two arm use online research randomizer newly diagnose ALL patient enrol research . From day start chemotherapy , patient arm A ( Intervention arm ) concurrently administer vitamin B12 vitamin B6 . Vitamin B12 give 500 Î¼g three time week intravenously basis every alternate day except day receive vincristine vitamin B6 give 50 mg thrice daily orally induction period ( 5 week ) chemotherapy cycle . On hand , patient arm B ( Placebo arm ) give placebo pill intravenous placebo injection interval . Prior initiation induction chemotherapy participant undergo neuropathy evaluation per National Cancer Institute 's Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( NCI-CTCAE ) v.4.0 scale interview accord neurotoxicity subscale Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy ( FACT ) -GOG- Ntx quality life assessment questionnaire . The participant re-evaluated weekly outset 2nd week , 3rd week , 4th 5th week vincristine chemotherapy induction period . They assess per NCI-CTCAE v.4.0 scale severity neuropathy FACT- GOG- Ntx answer specific question regard presence tingling , numbness , pain , muscle weakness motor activity . As neuropathy neuropathic pain mostly subjective issue rather objective reflect comprehensively particular person encounter , patient base measure use study . Incidence , onset severity peripheral neuropathy compare arm .</detailed_description>
