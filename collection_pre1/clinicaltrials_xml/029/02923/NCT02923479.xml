	<brief_title>Robot-assisted Rehabilitation Ankle Fractures : Efficacy Comparison With Traditional Methods</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION : Robotic device lower-limb rehabilitation mainly test neurologically injured patient . Up , clinical study use robotic training orthopedic condition . A pilot study carry INAIL Physical Rehabilitation Center Volterra use ARBOT , prototypal robotic system ankle rehabilitation . This device develop IIT - Italian Institute Technology consist two-degree-of-freedom electromechanical platform able perform exercise foreseen standard rehabilitation program . By virtue innovative motion system control architecture , ARBOT integrate multiple rehabilitation equipment function , perform also special exercise program elastic fluid-dynamic resistance . ARBOT allow train accord programmed sequence , order promote range movement , muscular function proprioceptive recovery . Exercises perform without bear weight . Moreover , ARBOT powerful evaluation instrument physiotherapist order verify record result rehabilitative intervention . The primary aim trial determine effectiveness , safety tolerability robot-assisted rehabilitation use ARBOT patient ankle dysfunction result work relate ankle fracture , compare conventional rehabilitation program . Secondary objective investigate correlation among physical disability parameter , collect data order define study protocol improve ARBOT 's performance ergonomics , ultimately evaluate patient satisfaction respect robot assist rehabilitation program . METHODS : Thirty-two patient work related injury result ankle and/or hindfoot fracture subsequent immobilization phase enrol open randomize control trial 30 month period . Each participant randomly allocate experimental control group receive 4-week rehabilitation program ( 20 session , 5 days/week admission discharge Rehabilitation Centre ) weekly robotic clinical assessment . Subjects experimental group treat use ARBOT passive , active active assist range-of-motion exercise , resistive exercise isometric , isotonic , isokinetic , elastic fluid-dynamic condition , proprioceptive training . Control subject assist physiotherapist range motion recovery exercise perform resistive proprioceptive training use Biodex System 3 dynamometer ProKin PK254 mobile electronic platform . The assessment session include measurement dorsiflexion ROM , isometric isokinetic plantar-flexion torque proprioceptive performance ARBOT 2 minute walk time stair climb test , LEFS-Lower Extremity Functional Scale AOFAS-Ankle-Hindfoot Scale . Site monitoring study conduct accord standard ISO 14155 .</detailed_description>
