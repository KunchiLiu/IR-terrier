	<brief_title>Primary Needle Knife Fistulotomy Versus Conventional Cannulation Method</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Endoscopic retrograde endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) widely use diagnosis treatment pancreatic biliary tract disease . However , post-ERCP pancreatitis ( PEP ) common adverse event follow procedure , range 2 % 10 % nonselective case , cause substantial morbidity , mortality , high medical cost . Recent advance cannulation technique accessory biliary cannulation contribute reduce incidence PEP , biliary cannulation fail 5 % 20 % case ERCP . Suprapapillary needle-knife fistulotomy ( NKF ) , without large-diameter balloon dilation , use rescue method case difficult biliary cannulation , NKF recommend initial approach selective biliary cannulation case repetitive unintentional pancreatic cannulation.9 Moreover , difficult biliary cannulation know risk factor PEP , report NKF associate low risk PEP . Thus , hypothesize NKF may reduce risk PEP patient increase risk PEP .</detailed_description>
