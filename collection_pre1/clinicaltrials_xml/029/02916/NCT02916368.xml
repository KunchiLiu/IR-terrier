	<detailed_description>Head neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma ( HNSCC ) one common head neck malignant tumor . Investigators find several patient early TNM stage poor differentiate HNSCC poor prognosis , yet someone advance TNM stage well differentiate HNSCC good prognosis . Hence , Investigators suggest prognosis factor survival rate probably related differentiation HNSCC , prognosis factor poorly differentiate HNSCC rare discuss controversy . Investigating prognostic factor poorly differentiate HNSCC undoubtedly crucial . About study , inclusion criterion follow part : patient poor differentiated HNSCC ; T1-4aN0-2M0 ; pathological examination : poor differentiate squamous cell carcinoma ; initial treatment ( primary , without surgery , radiotherapy chemotherapy ) ; range:18-70 year old ; KPS &gt; 80 ; hemogram function main organ heart , lung , liver kidney normal ; endoscopy , CT MRI form different group ; sign inform consent file , good compliance . AND exclusion criterion : uncontrollable epileptic seizure , disorder central nervous system unconsciousness cause psychosis ; serious uncontrollable infection ; main organ system failure ( include heart , lung , liver kidney ) ; reject training ; high moderate differentiate squamous cell carcinoma</detailed_description>
