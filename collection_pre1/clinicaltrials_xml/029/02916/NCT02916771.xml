	<brief_title>Trial Combination Ixazomib Lenalidomide Dexamethasone Smoldering Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study Phase II clinical trial , test effectiveness investigational drug ( ) . The investigational drug use research study Ixazomib , Lenalidomide Dexamethasone . `` Investigational '' mean FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve combination Ixazomib , Lenalidomide Dexamethasone treatment regimen Smoldering Multiple Myeloma . The purpose research study learn whether combination Ixazomib , Lenalidomide , Dexamethasone work treat Smoldering Multiple Myeloma . Ixazomib drug may kill stop cancer cell grow block proteasome within cell , responsible degrade break variety protein . This type drug call proteasome inhibitor . Lenalidomide immunomodulatory drug , mean modifies participant immune system help fight participant disease . Dexamethasone steroid , usually combine drug enhance effect fight participant disease . Ixazomib approve FDA combination Lenalidomide Dexamethasone treatment Multiple Myeloma currently evaluate use treatment several type cancer . Both Lenalidomide Dexamethasone previously approve FDA treatment Multiple Myeloma , well several cancer .</detailed_description>
