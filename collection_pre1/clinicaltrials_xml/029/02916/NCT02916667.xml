	<detailed_description>Background : Many study link pre-pregnancy obesity metabolic syndrome , increase risk develop gestational diabetes mellitus ( GDM ) . These factor associate increase risk newborn obesity , insulin resistance diabetes . Recently , study show `` Chrono-Biological '' ( CB ) aspect need consider context . These factor relate endogenous circadian clock , regulate many body function depend upon cycle light darkness day almost 24 hour . By track daily fluctuation heart rate , blood pressure , hormone secretion control variety metabolic pathway . Factors affect set circadian clock may include ; Change dark light hour , consumption certain nutrient day . Chronic rhythm disruption associate development obesity , diabetes , . Factors `` chrono-nutrition '' ( CN ) significant impact variation circadian rhythm include : meal program schedule , glucose , saturate fat , caffeine alcohol intake , ratio macronutrients . Intervention study adults obese diabetes able reduce impact disorder change composition schedule meal lead weight loss diabetes control . Moreover , Insomnia pregnancy cause disorder CB . Insomnia affect 30-40 % pregnancy . Some sleep disorder worsen pregnancy , particularly overweight . Currently , routine monitoring treatment woman GDM include screen sleep disorder CN factor . Working hypothesis aim : To asses CB factor third trim participant GDM pregnancy weight childbirth related complication . The investigator hypothesize participant GDM pregnancies high CB status end higher birth weight compare participant GDM pregnancy low status . In addition , investigator assume CN intervention program contribute reduce rate birth weight 90 percentile compare control group . Methods : In prospective cohort study , n= 280 , The investigator review obstetric outcome impact CB disorder complication mother fetus , questionnaire . In clinical trial n=100 , The investigator assess effect CN intervention birth weight participant GDM pregnancy . Expected result : Based investigator preliminary research literature , The investigator expect due increase prevalence obesity sleep disturbance among GDM pregnancy , feasibility high interference CN factor pregnancy , Therefore , important examine impact CB factor maternal fetal . The importance study : Since high probability GDM expose interference CB factor monitor GDM , unique study , great importance understand potential impact CB factor higher birth weight rate .</detailed_description>
