	<brief_title>Effects Nitrate Vegetables Blood Pressure Subjects With Prehypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent study indicate dietary-derived inorganic nitrate affect blood pressure human convert nitric oxide bioactivity . Here study vegetable naturally contain high amount nitrate ( green leafy vegetable ) low blood pressure whether effect attribute nitrate anion . High nitrate vegetable compare vegetable low nitrate ( e.g . tomato , sweet pepper ) . After 2 week run period subject receive vegetable low nitrate , participant randomize one three intervention . One third patient receive high-nitrate vegetable + placebo pill ( KCl ) , one third receive low-nitrate vegetable + placebo third group receive low-nitrate vegetable + nitrate pill ( KNO3 ) . The nitrate content pill precisely match nitrate content high-nitrate vegetable group .</detailed_description>
