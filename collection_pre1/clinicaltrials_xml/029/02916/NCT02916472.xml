	<detailed_description>Objectives Specific Aim 1 : To evaluate feasibility ( adherence ; user acceptance : exercise tolerance , enjoyment motivation ) perform adaptive , moderate intensity , aerobic exercise program 'cybercycle ' compare control ( stretching/resistance band ) adolescent young adult ( AYA ) cancer . Aim 1 Hypothesis : The investigator hypothesize AYA cancer able adhere tolerate moderate intensity cycle program , patient 'cybercycling ' exercise program great exercise tolerance , exercise enjoyment exercise motivation . ( Exploratory ) Aim 2 : To explore effect adaptive , moderate intensity aerobic exercise program use 'cybercycle ' compare control ( stretching/resistance band ) change fitness , body composition , quality life ( QoL ) , fatigue , sleep cognition . Aim 2 Hypothesis : The investigator hypothesize patient 'cybercycling ' program great improvement fitness , fatigue , QoL , sleep cognitive test score well great reduction body fat improve maintenance fat-free mass compare control condition . Study Design/Overview : This study randomize trial 20 adolescent young adult ( AYA ) cancer survivor ( 15-30 year old ) compare two intervention arm : 1 ) aerobic exercise 'cybercycle ' ( stationary cycling exergaming/videogaming ) ; , 2 ) stretching/resistance band 'control ' condition .</detailed_description>
