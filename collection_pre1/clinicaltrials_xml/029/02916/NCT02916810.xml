	<brief_summary>Major psychotic symptom auditory hallucination ( AH ) main feature schizophrenia psychotic disorder , result severe social clinical dysfunction . However , symptom sufficiently unresponsive antipsychotic medication substantial portion patient . Neuroimaging study suggest aberrant activity specific brain region frontal area , sensory area language-related area relate symptom . Transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) provide non-invasive mean alter brain electrical neural activity . TMS use wide range clinical research especially neurology psychiatry . There preliminary treatment psychosis AH use TMS result inconsistent . The high inter-subject variability limit efficacy TMS treatment schizophrenia patient . The investigator aim develop TMS treatment method functional MRI-defined treatment target area , TMS target individually identify maximize TMS effect . If current target-identification successfully identify effective TMS target individually , treatment efficacy could significant improve patient benefit TMS treatment .</brief_summary>
