	<brief_title>Feasibility Study Using Navigational Bronchoscopy Perform PDT-Photofrin® Unresectable Peripheral Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lung cancer account almost one-third cancer death . Cancer screen strategy potential achieve 20 % reduction death rate . Newly develop bronchoscopic technology ( navigational bronchoscopy ) show enable physician safely reach lesion peripheral region lung obtain diagnosis . This new technology may potentially offer bronchoscopic therapeutic intervention , photodynamic therapy , tumor previously unreachable due peripheral anatomic location . Photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) use combination photosensitize drug ( drug activate light ) , call porfimer sodium ( Photofrin® ) , light laser emit heat . This technique work allow medical doctor specifically target destroy abnormal cancer cell limit damage surround healthy tissue . The activation drug do light abnormal area use fiber optic device ( fine fiber [ like fish line ] permit light transmission ) insert flexible tube call bronchoscope . The light activates porfimer sodium , concentrate abnormal tissue , lead destruction . The purpose study determine physician reach tumor periphery lung via electronavigational bronchoscopy deliver photodynamic therapy place optical fiber tumor .</detailed_description>
