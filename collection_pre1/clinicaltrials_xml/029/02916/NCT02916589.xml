	<detailed_description>Obesity diabetes mellitus Obesity one serious public health issue ( National Food Agency , 2016 ) . In Swedish adult ( 16-84 year ) population , 35 % overweight almost 15 % obese ( Statistics Sweden ) . The commonly use definition obesity base body mass index ( BMI ; overweight 25.0-29.9 kg/m2 , obesity 30.0-39.9 kg/m2 severe obesity &gt; 40 kg/m2 ) World Health Organization . Many study show increased risk all-cause mortality great adiposity measure BMI . The share overweight obese inhabitant Skåne increase gradually recent decade . Currently , half , ( 57 % ) men either overweight obese corresponding figure woman 41 percent . These obesity rate somewhat high rest Sweden ( Regional Folkhälsostrategi för Skåne , 2010 ) . However , physical inactivity sedentary behavior increase since 2000 ( Regional Folkhälsostrategi för Skåne , 2010 ) . The consequence obesity include increase risk coronary heart disease , high blood pressure , stroke , diabetes . Diabetes Diabetes major health problem characterize elevate serum blood sugar level ( hyperglycaemia ) . Hyperglycemia result insulin resistance , well dysfunctional islet β-cells unable secrete adequate insulin regulate blood sugar level . The financial burden health care system provide care individual diabetes mellitus considerable , significant secondary damage many organ body ( Nolan et al. , 2011 ) . Recent estimate indicate 8.3 % adult - 382 million people worldwide - diabetes ( diabetes mellitus type 1 : T1D , diabetes mellitus type 2 : T2D ) number may approach 600 million people le 25 year ( Anonymous IDF 2013 ) . T2D predominant form condition account least 90 % case . The excess global mortality 2000 attribute T2D , 2.9 million death . In USA , diabetes lead cause blindness , well cause around 40 % end-stage renal failure event 60 % non-traumatic lower-limb amputation ( Nolan et al. , 2011 ) . Periodontitis Periodontitis hallmark diabetes mellitus ( Loe , 1993 ) chronic inflammatory disease gingiva ( gum tissue ) , teeth , support bone , leading loss connective tissue attachment teeth , alveolar bone loss . The disease result complex interaction bacteria host immune response ( Salvi et al. , 2005 ) . Periodontal tissue destruction cause host response development complex bacterial biofilm ( Thomas et al. , 2013 ) . Periodontal infection trigger release pro-inflammatory cytokine IL1β , IL6 , IL8 TNFα , site infection endothelial cell system ( Zdarilova et al. , 2010 ; Kocgozlu et al. , 2009 ) . It generally perceive periodontitis precede gingivitis , aetiology transition gingivitis periodontitis remain unknown . Gingivitis present swollen tissue increase redness loss attachment teeth . Poor glycemic control patient often present severely inflamed gum tissue loss tooth-supporting alveolar bone . Several study report chronic periodontitis prevalent patient diabetes ( Kim et al. , 2013 , Moodley et al. , 2013 ) . In poorly control type 2 diabetes pro-inflammatory cytokine chemokines may partially explain great susceptibility diabetic individual periodontal breakdown ( Duarte et al. , 2014 ) . To identify bacterial pathogen responsible periodontitis , one use cultivation molecular identification method . No single group pathogens clearly identify causative agent agent gingivitis . Indeed , Kumar et al. , ( 2003 ) show 40 % organism detect novel specie base ribosomal 16S clone sequence . They also conclude among bacterial specie identify sample collect healthy chronic periodontitis patient , one third prevalent among non-healthy individual . Treatment periodontitis usually focus elimination infection lower bacterial load use surgical , non-surgical antibiotic . These treatment considerable side effect , limited effect time usually costly . However , another way control inflammation radical change diet . Okinawa Igelösa Diet Prevention high BMI obesity require range measure include moderate dietary habit . Research show consume food rich fiber , like whole grain , vegetable , legume , fruit , berry nut , easily retain stable weight ( National Food Agency , 2016 ) . Okinawa island Japan top rank world come longevity . The reason behind long life original population Okinawa combination genetic life style-related factor impossible entangle separate role ( Steen , 2010 ) . However , traditional lifestyle Okinawa characterize low level stress , natural exercise diet describe mainly vegetarian fish main source animal protein fat . Steen ( 2010 ) refers book `` Okinawa program '' author Suzuki , Willcox Willcox describe `` eat Okinawa way '' . According author food source directly nature , make edible little intervention possible . Comparable Swedish National Food Agency 's recommendation vegetable whole grain constitutes large part natural diet , characterize content calcium , antioxidant form flavonoid , omega-3 . Another important principle capture statement `` weigh option carefully '' imply food consume long certain food , like animal protein sweet overconsumed ( Steen , 2010 ) . Since 2004 Igelösa Life Science AB develop modify Nordic diet base evidence , primarily diet Okinawa population . The Igelösa-diet consist food without supplement , mainly base locally produce traditional Nordic ingredient intact grain ( oat , rye , barley , wheat ) , vegetable , legume , root vegetable , fish , poultry , fruit nut . At time , diet restricts intake sugar , red meat , delicatessen dairy product . The diet nutritious contains low number calorie usual recommendation . Research within field Changes diet reduce inflammation ( Baumgartner et al. , 2009 ) , comparably clinical intervention control gingival inflammation ( Widén et al. , 2015 ) . In 2015 , clinical nutrition study 30 subject T2D carry Kävlinge . For 12 week every individual receive Igelösa diet free charge . This consist two meal day , ready heat , include salad , fruit snack breakfast muesli porridge . In follow 12 week individual cook food help key product . Individualized dietary advice available . A research team Skåne University Hospital Malmö document individual 's general condition metabolic parameter glucose , lipids insulin . Blood , urine faecal sample collect baseline 2 , 12 24 week . The approach effective result several individual longer require insulin . Assessment Periodontitis Since 1963 , gingival inflammation determine incidence bleed probe ( BOP ) , , via slight pressure gum see cause bleed ( Loe &amp; Silness , 1963 ) . BOP bias avoid use state-of-the-art laser-based measurement system exploit Doppler Effect record blood flow . Laser Doppler flow reading show positively correlate degree gingival inflammation ( Gleissner et al , 2006 , Patiño-Marín 2005 ) . We apply Doppler technique comparison traditional BOP method . Cytokines ( immune system signal ) biomarkers inflammation easily measure fluid collect periodontal pocket . Aim Study The purpose study investigate association dietary intake , periodontal status , bacterial population measurement inflammation 30 obese individual . Specific objectives - We wish determine whether change diet lead weight loss , low incidence systemic local inflammation , less need medication ? - Is correlate microbial population change mouth ? - Is correlation cytokine level bacterial number sample serum gingival crevicular fluid periodontal pocket ? - Are Laser Doppler blood flow measurement pro-inflammatory cytokine well method assess periodontal inflammation compare bleed probe ?</detailed_description>
