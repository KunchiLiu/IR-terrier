	<brief_summary>This study open-label , randomize control trial . Patients randomize two group 15 , `` Routine Care '' group , serve control group , `` Octreotide '' group . The amount bronchial secretion routinely measure mechanically ventilated patient . Once Primary Team identifies patient candidate study ( base inclusion exclusion criterion ) inform consent obtain , baseline volume bronchial secretion per 12-hour period record security envelope contain group assignment open ICU attend . Both group continue receive treatment already initiate manage bronchial secretion . In addition , `` Octreotide '' group receive parenteral octreotide , `` Routine Care '' group receive care deem necessary Primary Team . The rate bronchial secretion measure recorded daily ; change , relative baseline measurement , compare group . These intervention continue 72 hour extubation withdrawal study , whichever occur early . Subsequently , standard care management , determine Primary Team , resume .</brief_summary>
