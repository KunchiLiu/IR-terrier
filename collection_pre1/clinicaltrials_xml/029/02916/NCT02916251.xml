	<brief_title>ZP4207 ( Dasiglucagon ) Administered T1D Patients Assess PK PD Compared Marketed Glucagon</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Seventeen ( 17 ) adult patient T1DM treat continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion ( insulin pump , CSII ) randomize take part four dose visit . The dose visit separate 3-7 day . For three low dose level ( 0.03 mg , 0.08 mg , 0.2 mg ) patient receive two dos ZP4207 ( dasiglucagon ) ( first euglycaemic second hypoglycaemic condition ) one dose glucagon euglycaemic condition visit 2-4 . The first two dose administration ( Day 1 , visit 2-4 ) separate least five hour . The third dose , ZP4207 ( dasiglucagon ) hypoglycemia , dose visit administer next morning standardize carbohydrate-rich meal evening . The patient stay clinical site night Day 1 Day 2 . The dose 0.6 mg administer ZP4207 ( dasiglucagon ) . The order micro-dose level well order treatment , ZP4207 ( dasiglucagon ) vs. glucagon , randomize . For patient 0.6 mg dose ZP4207 ( dasiglucagon ) administer visit 5 . For dose level 2 set PK/PD profile ZP4207 ( dasiglucagon ) , one initiate euglycaemia another hypoglycaemia . Each patient enrol therefore provide total 11 PK/PD profile cover four different dose level ; 8 profile ZP4207 ( dasiglucagon ) 3 profile glucagon</detailed_description>

	<criteria>To include trial , patient fulfil follow criterion : 1 . Signed date informed consent obtain trialrelated activity . ( Trialrelated activity procedure would perform normal management patient ) . 2 . Male female patient T1DM least 1 year , define American Diabetes Association1 . 3 . Age 18 64 year , inclusive . 4 . HbA1c &lt; 8.5 % . 5 . Cpeptide negative define low limit quantification . 6 . Stable insulin regimen via insulin infusion pump least 1 month prior screen . 7 . Weight 60 kg 90 kg , inclusive . 8 . Patients good health accord age ( medical history , physical examination , vital sign , 12lead ECGs , lab assessment ) , judge Investigator . Patients meet follow criterion screen evaluation exclude trial participation : 1 . Unable provide inform consent ( e.g. , impaired cognition judgement ) . 2 . Patients mental incapacity language barrier preclude adequate understanding cooperation , unwilling participate trial , opinion Investigator participate trial . 3 . Receipt medicinal product clinical development within 3 month prior screen . 4 . Previous exposure ZP4207 ( dasiglucagon ) previously randomize trial . 5 . Known suspect allergy trial product ( ) relate product . 6 . History adverse reaction glucagon ( include allergy ) besides nausea vomiting . 7 . History multiple and/or severe allergy drug food history severe anaphylactic reaction . 8 . New onset clinically significant illness within 4 week prior screen , judge Investigator . 9 . History liver disease expect interfere antihypoglycemia action glucagon ( e.g. , liver failure cirrhosis ) . Other liver disease ( i.e. , active hepatitis , steatosis , active biliary disease , tumor liver , hemochromatosis , glycogen storage disease ) may exclude patient cause significant compromise liver function may unpredictable fashion . 10 . Any history presence clinically relevant cardiovascular , pulmonary , respiratory , gastrointestinal , renal , metabolic , endocrinological ( exception condition associate diabetes mellitus ) , haematological , dermatological , neurological , osteomuscular , articular , psychiatric , systemic , ocular , gynaecologic ( female ) , infectious disease , sign acute illness judge Investigator . 11 . Clinically significant abnormal haematology , biochemistry urinalysis screening test , judge Investigator . In particular , elevate liver enzyme ( AST ALT &gt; 2 time upper limit normal , bilirubin &gt; 1.5 upper limit normal ) impair renal function ( elevate serum creatinine value upper limit normal ) . 12 . Hypertension systolic blood pressure &gt; 140 mmHg diastolic blood pressure &gt; 90 mmHg ( exclude whitecoat hypertension ; therefore , repeat measurement show value within range , patient include trial ) ; heart rate rest outside range 5090 beat per minute . 13 . Clinically significant abnormal standard 12lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) 5 minute rest supine position screening , judge Investigator . 14 . Proliferative retinopathy maculopathy and/or severe neuropathy , particular autonomic neuropathy , judge Investigator . 15 . Inadequate venous access determine trial nurse physician time screen 16 . Any factor , judgment Principal Investigator , would interfere trial endpoint safe completion trial procedure . 17 .
