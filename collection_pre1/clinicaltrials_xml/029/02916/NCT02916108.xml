	<brief_summary>Approximately 150,000 child present year emergency department ( EDs ) US concussion many treat primary care physician , outpatient specialist . Concussion define traumatically induced transient disturbance brain function involve complex pathophysiological process . There variety symptom related concussion , diagnosis concussion require use symptom-checklist . Since various degree severity symptom , diagnosis subjective one lack sensitivity . One major problem approximately one-third child concussion experience ongoing somatic , cognitive , psychological behavioral symptom , refer persistent post-concussion symptom . A recent study investigate validity 12-point PPCS risk score reveal modest validity ( 0.71 ) . Moreover , one great concern child 's schedule return activity . Since basic mechanism concussion acceleration/ deceleration movement axon , likely express desynchronization delta wave activity anterior hemisphere see pathological problem related attention and/ work memory ) . The aim proof-of-concept study find-out whether interhemispheric desynchronization delta wave ( IHDD ) anterior hemisphere identify acute concussion child . If investigator find IHDD accurately diagnose acute concussion , second objective examine whether index useful tool follow patient persistent post-concussion symptom .</brief_summary>
