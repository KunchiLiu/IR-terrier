	<brief_title>The Influence GVS Mental Transformation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Theories embody mental rotation suggest overlap process real body egocentric mental transformation . Corroboratory behavioral evidence show interaction effect vestibular stimulation egocentric transformation . Yet , study far investigated cortical area involve vestibular processing and/or illusory self-motion mental transformation task within participant . This however seem crucial , important individual difference exist mental transformation ability well subjective perception artificial vestibular stimulation . The primary objective reveal brain area ( ) involve interaction illusory self-motion ( induced galvanic vestibular stimulation ( GVS ) ) egocentric mental transformation , compare illusory self-motion object-based mental transformation . It hypothesize GVS induce illusory self-motion dampens ability perform egocentric mental transformation object-based mental transformation . As previous behavioral study interaction always do sit position , secondary objective first replicate previous behavioral mental rotation study use GVS , Magnetic Resonance ( MR ) -scanner comparable setting . Moreover , brain imaging study far investigated subjective illusory motion experience induce GVS , illusory self-motion measure included statistical model find specific brain region modulate illusory self-motion perception .</detailed_description>
