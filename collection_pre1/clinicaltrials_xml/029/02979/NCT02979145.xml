	<brief_summary>The purpose study develop validate clinical outcome measure evaluate disability disease progression child 3 year age young ( infant toddler ) various type Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease ( CMT ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease ( CMT ) Infant Scale ( INC-6611 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Most form CMT begin childhood progress throughout person 's lifetime . Current research suggest treatment slow disease progression may effective introduce early patient 's life muscle weakness sensation loss develop , may easier slow disease progression reverse disability already place . Clinical outcome measure develop adult ( CMT Neuropathy Score ) child 3 year age old ( CMT Pediatric Scale ) . However , CMT-specific clinical outcome measure currently exist measure disease severity progression child birth 3 year age . It goal study develop validate CMT Infant Scale ( CMTInfS ) meet need .</detailed_description>
