	<detailed_description>High-Flow nasal cannula therapy administration heat , humidify blend air/oxygen via nasal cannula rate least 2 L/kg bodyweight /min . This high-flow nasal cannula therapy develop neonatal intensive care unit preterm baby respiratory pause alternative continuous pressure support ( CPAP ) . Due ease use safety apply wide range indication , oxygen delivery therapy increasingly gain interest provide respiratory support paediatric adult patient respiratory failure ICU . High-flow nasal cannula therapy apply preterm infant respiratory distress syndrome , apnoea prematurity respiratory support extubation . In adult population use HFNCT focus hypoxemic respiratory failure improvement reduction hypoxemia intubation anesthesia environment . A new application high-flow nasal cannula therapy adult extension apnoea time patient difficult airway undergo general anesthesia . In environment new term kind oxygen therapy create : THRIVE transnasal humidify rapid-insufflation ventilatory exchange . To distinguish kind high-flow nasal cannula therapy apnoeic patient one paediatric ICU ward investigator use term i-THRIVE infant transnasal humidify rapid insufflation ventilation exchange . Due increase oxygen consumption reduce functional residual capacity , neonate , infant , small child reduce apnoea tolerance compare adult . Furthermore infant small child great closing capacity , increase airway collapse general anesthesia muscle paralysis . A direct consequence hypoxemia likely occur cessation spontaneous assist ventilation induction anesthesia . Apnoea without supplemental oxygen lead hypoxemia 1-year-old infant without preoxygenation within second . All paediatric ( adult ) patient undergo general anesthesia least brief period apnoea intubation time face-mask remove patient tube place trachea . Therefore , least short phase deoxygenation may occur . However anesthesia need provide emergency situation presence difficult airway , rate complication increase rapidly . In circumstance method reduce desaturation incident prolong difficult intubation desirable . Due oxygen toxicity neonates small child , prevention hypoxemia oxygen concentration 60 % would favourable set . Despite promising pilot result high-flow nasal cannula therapy , unknown whether technique superior low-flow oxygenation high concentration whether necessary apply high-flow nasal cannula therapy high ( 80-100 % ) versus low ( 30-50 % ) concentration oxygen . This study investigate control circumstance concept i-THRIVE prolong apnoea time without deoxygenation improve safety airway management paediatric patient . Furthermore , study enables quantify effect different oxygen concentration high-flow nasal cannula therapy distinguishes well conventional low-flow apnoeic oxygenation method .</detailed_description>
