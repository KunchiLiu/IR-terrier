	<brief_summary>Background : People severe aplastic anemia ( SAA ) make enough red white blood cell , and/or platelet . Their body immune system stop bone marrow make cell . The treatment cyclosporine lead well blood count . But treatment stop , disease may return 1 3 people . The drug sirolimus may help suppress immune system . Objective : To evaluate compare usefulness sirolimus prevent aplastic anemia return cyclosporine stop , compare stop cyclosporine alone . Eligibility : People age 2 old SAA : Have respond immunosuppressive therapy include cyclosporine , continue take cyclosporine Are take drug hematologic effect Design : Participants screen : Medical history Physical exam Blood urine test Bone marrow biopsy : The area hipbone numb . A thin needle remove bone marrow . Participants randomly assign group . All stop cyclosporine . Group 1 take sirolimus mouth time day 3 month close monitor . Group 2 receive study drug monitor closely . Participants clinical test first 3 month : Weekly blood test Monthly fasting blood test For group 1 , measurement sirolimus blood every 1 2 week Participants clinic visit 3 month , 12 month , annually 5 year study start . They may another visit SAA return . These include : Blood urine test Bone marrow biopsy</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Most acquired aplastic anemia ensue immune-mediated destruction hematopoietic stem progenitor cell - Immunosuppression definitive treatment patient acquire aplastic anemia candidate immediate hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . - Horse ATG combine calcineurin inhibitor , cyclosporine ( CsA ) , remain standard first-line immunosuppressive therapy ( IST ) . - Hematologic response transfusion independence occur two third patient standard IST 80-90 % patient treated IST combination growth factor eltrombopag . - About 30 % 40 % patient relapse discontinuation cyclosporine . Many achieve disease control reinitiation CSA , remain CSA dependent indefinitely . - Evidence mouse model bone marrow failure indicate conversion cyclosporine mTOR inhibitor , sirolimus ( SRL ) , result immune tolerance endure eventual withdrawal SRL . - We hypothesize CSA SRL conversion significantly decrease relapse rate immunosuppressive therapy acquire aplastic anemia . - This study investigate safety efficacy SRL prevent relapse patient previously treat IST remain CSA . The primary endpoint rate relapse 2 year follow conversion CSA SRL , versus stop CSA . - Biological sample peripheral blood bone marrow aspirate treatment use investigate change lymphocyte phenotype cytokine profile .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Age great equal 2 year old 2 . Weight great 12 kg 3 . Previous diagnosis SAA bone marrow biopsy cytogenics , treat ATGbased regimen include cyclosporine . The ATG must administer least 12 month prior . 4 . Continuous treatment cyclosporine previous 6 month ( exclude minor dose delay exceed 30 day ) . 5 . Evidence hematologic response ATGbased regimen evidence least two follow : Absolute neutrophil count great 500/uL Platelet count great 20,000/uL ( without transfusion support ) Absolute reticulocyte count great 60,000/uL ( hemoglobin 10 gm/dL without transfusion support ) EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Evidence relapse aplastic anemia due cyclosporine withdrawal previous 6 month 2 . Prior use sirolimus mTOR inhibitor within 12 week study entry 3 . Myelodysplastic syndrome acute myeloid leukemia , accord WHO diagnostic criterion ( baseline BM consistent MDS enrollment , patient consider ineligible immediately exit study , subject replace another subject ) 4 . Patients CYP3A4 inhibitor replace medication equivalent medication period study : protease inhibitor ( ritonavir , indinavir , nelfinavir , saquinavir ) , macrolide antibiotic ( clarithromycin , telithromycin , erythromycin ) , azole antifungal ( fluconazole , itraconazole , ketoconazole ) , metroclopramide , felodipine , nifedipine , carbamazepine , phenobarbital , grapefruit juice St. John Wort . 5 . Anaphylactic hypersensitivity reaction sirolimus 6 . Patients infection adequately respond appropriate therapy evidence persistence clear source infection , view investigator , would preclude safe treatment sirolimus . 7 . Current pregnancy , unwillingness take oral contraceptive use barrier method birth control practice abstinence refrain pregnancy childbearing potential course study 8 . Lactating woman , due potentially harmful effect nurse child . 9 . Patients receive live vaccine within past 30 day 10 . Patients cancer actively receive chemotherapeutic treatment take drug hematological effect thrombopoietin receptor agonist ( eltrombopag ) , granulocytecolony stimulate factor erythroid stimulating agent . 11 . Moribund status death within 7 10 day likely . Comorbidities severity view Investigator would likely preclude patient 's ability tolerate sirolimus . 12 . Inability understand investigational nature study give inform consent without legally authorize representative surrogate provide inform consent .</criteria>
