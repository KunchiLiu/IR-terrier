	<brief_summary>Specific Aim 1 . Determine valid result non-sedated MRI base assessment liver stiffness lipid content obtain 90 % child young adult cystic fibrosis . Specific Aim 2 . Determine hepatic lipid content use HepaFat sequence liver stiffness use MRE . Investigators compare result obtain MRI PUSH study grayscale ultrasound CF patient normal , heterogeneous , homogeneous nodular ( cirrhotic ) pattern ultrasound . Specific Aim 3 . Creation image core lab centralize evaluation MR imaging data , allow remote image upload , electronic data storage , remote image viewing/interpretation . This infrastructure utilized standardize image post processing . Specific Aim 4 . Using longitudinal PUSH study , determine MRI base image improves discrimination subject risk progression advance CF liver disease ( development cirrhosis ) compare use US image alone</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MRI Characterize Predict CF Liver Disease PUSH Cohort</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This proposal cross sectional study current well-characterized PUSH cohort . Patients receive MRI time schedule PUSH ultrasound . Ideally , MRI perform day similar time point near liver ultrasound ( +/-90 day , Investigators allow large window due slow progression fibrosis ) . Blinded radiology review image sequence perform local study radiologist central review perform Imaging Core . Analysis Imaging Core include calculation liver stiffness , liver spleen volume , hepatic lipid content MRI study .</detailed_description>
