	<brief_title>Accuracy Rapid Diagnostic Test Cutaneous Leishmaniasis Morocco</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study participant recruit nine health center locate fourthree CL endemic province . The RDT evaluation ( index test ) CL Detect™ Rapid Test ( InBios , USA ) ; membrane-based amastigote antigen ( peroxidoxin ) detection test . The reference standard consist two test : direct examination skin smear PCR . For patient , health professional take one dental broach sample four skin smear sample single lesion . The dental broach sample use RDT , do . The skin smear sample send provincial laboratory microscopy test reference laboratory Morocco Belgium PCR test ITS1 PCR , Hsp70 genotyping parasite load determination . Readers index reference test access clinical information test result . The result test evaluation ( RDT ) molecular test ( PCR ) communicate patient her/his physician , case management follow current clinical guideline .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants suspect Cutaneous Leishmaniasis wound ( ) apparently healthy state Who able learn Information sheet sign Informed consent form selves parent presence witness ( illiterate people ) Who satisfy follow criterion : ulcerative lesion accessible part body perform dental broach scrap . Just one ulcerative lesion patient could select ( The new less infected ) Lesion le 04 month age Patients nodular , papular , macular nodulopapular suspect CL form Patients ulcerative lesion suspect bacteria origin could disappear short course antibiotic treatment . Patients already receive last two month , prior sign consent , physical treatment ( e.g . cryotherapy , thermotherapy , Laser ) traditional treatment ( e.g . burn , acide , traditional scraping ) Patients present disease need take antiparasite treatment Patient acute chronic disease need hospitalization Patient already receive antimoniate treatment incomplete complete duration dose CL Any situation could engage security patient health professional ( e.g . People psychiatric trouble mental handicap ) For child le 12 year old , decision participation mainly base condition parent able learn understand information sheet sign inform consent form</criteria>
