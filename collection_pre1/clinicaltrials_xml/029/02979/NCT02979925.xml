Pain distribution across nerve territory history indicate relevant lesion disease plus criterion list and/or b ( A ) : At least one negative positive sensory sign symptom confine innervation territory lesioned nervous structure . Examples negative positive sign symptom include : Burning , stab tingle sensation/pain Numbness/paresthesia Cold , heat pressure Hyperalgesia allodynia Hypoesthesia Increased decrease sharp sensation ( e.g. , pinprick test ) Decreased vibration/vibratory sensation ( B ) : Prior diagnostic test confirm lesion disease explain neuropathic pain ( Nerve conduction study , electromyogram ( EMG ) , skin nerve biopsy ) . Documentation affect nerve ( ) indicate subject 's pain neuropathic origin result injury/trauma affected/implicated nerve ( ) . Subjects present follow include study : Subjects neuropathic pain due : diabetic peripheral neuropathy post herpetic neuralgia Human Immunodeficiency Virus chemo/antiviral therapy trigeminal neuralgia carpal tunnel syndrome subject whose posttraumatic neuropathic pain categorized central ( e.g. , spinal cord injury ) rather peripheral Subjects pain due Complex Regional Pain Syndrome ( CRPS , Type I Type II ) Phantom limb pain amputation .
