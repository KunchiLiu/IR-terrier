	<brief_summary>An oral tolerance induction ( OTI ) protocol conduct allergy Unit Saint Vincent Hospital Lille ( France ) standard care since 2006 . This protocol consist expose patient regularly increase dos allergen . This protocol induce increase threshold reactive dose ( minimum dose allergen trigger reactive reaction ) decrease quantity specific immunoglobulin E ( sIgE ) peanut protein . The protocol end patient reach threshold reactive dose 2942mg peanut protein , correspond 14 peanut middle size , maximum dose peanut find standard product France . The investigator wish study evolution threshold reactive dose sIgE patient follow OTI protocol . All need data available medical record study conduct retrospective data .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Prevalence food allergy estimate 3.5 % Europe . In particular , peanut allergy prevalence France 0.3 % 0.75 % , 1 % US , UK Canada . Peanut allergy severe allergy , second behind tree nut allergy general population , risk fatal reaction . The risk especially high young adult . It also long lasting condition 20 % natural healing happen time 6 8y.o . These last year , propose `` treatment '' elimination diet . However , prove make allergy severity worse , sensitization reactivity increase time . Elimination diet also lead apparition avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder , major impact patient habit , cause patient quality life decrease . In view risk limit elimination diet low natural healing rate , therapeutic alternative propose development peanut oral tolerance induction ( OTI ) protocols . As sublingual immunotherapy low efficacy injection strategy high risk severe allergic reaction , oral route prefer . This strategy need ensure patient increase tolerance allergen , thus limit risk anaphylactic shock low dos , also need ensure patient safety , control risk secondary reaction home . It follow young patient , efficiency increase . An OTI protocol conduct allergy Unit Saint Vincent Hospital Lille ( France ) standard care since 2006 . It consist daily give small peanut dos patient , regularly increase dos . For OTI protocol , oral food challenge ( OFC ) perform . This OFC allow determination threshold reactive dose , i.e . minimum dose allergen induces allergic reaction . A safe dose peanut determine regularly eaten patient . Every 6 month , new OFC perform thus new threshold reactive dose measure , dose eaten patient update . The protocol follow patient reach ideal dose 2942mg peanut protein , correspond 14 peanut middle size , maximum dose peanut find standard product France . Of course , protocol also end patient decide . Although protocol perform allergy Unit Saint Vincent Hospital , data publish subject . The aim study study evolution threshold reactive dose evolution quantity specific immunoglobulin E ( sIgE ) peanut protein ( rAra h 1 , rAra h 2 rAra h 3 ) patient follow protocol . The main objective study study clinical efficiency peanut OTI measure evolution patient threshold reactive dose . The secondary objective study biological efficiency peanut OTI measure evolution dosage sIgE peanut protein . As OFC IgE dosage standard part OTI protocol , data obtain medical record . The study retrospective thus observational .</detailed_description>
