	<brief_summary>The aim study investigate immunogenicity safety CYD dengue vaccine Cervarix administer concomitantly sequentially healthy female subject age 9-14 year age . Primary objective : - To demonstrate humoral immune response ( term geometric mean titer ) Cervarix concomitant administration non-inferior sequential administration CYD dengue vaccine measure 28 day last dose Cervarix . - To demonstrate humoral immune response CYD dengue vaccine concomitant administration non-inferior sequential administration Cervarix measure 28 day last dose CYD dengue vaccine . Secondary Objectives : - To demonstrate humoral immune response ( term seroconversion ) Cervarix concomitant administration non-inferior sequential administration CYD dengue vaccine measure 28 day last dose Cervarix - To describe humoral immune response Cervarix baseline dose Cervarix group - To describe humoral immune response CYD dengue vaccine baseline dose CYD dengue vaccine , group - To describe safety Cervarix CYD dengue vaccine dose group .</brief_summary>
