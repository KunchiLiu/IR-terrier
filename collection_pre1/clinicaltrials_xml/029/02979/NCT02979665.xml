	<brief_summary>anti-VEGF therapy establish method control leakage abnormal growth retinal blood vessel . Questions long-term effect retina , intraocular pressure overall retinal perfusion treatment remain answered . The purpose study evaluate change retina follow anti-VEGF treatment time , use structural functional diagnostic test .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Changes Retina Following Anti-VEGF Treatments Diabetic Macular Edema</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetic retinopathy ( DR ) cause change capillary nourish retina . Two treatment clinically use DR laser photocoagulation reduce angiogenic drive knock metabolically active retina anti-VEGF drug diabetic macular edema ( DME ) . DME affect approximately 2.5 % nearly 2.4 million Canadians diabetes , approximately 60,000 Canadians , make major cause adult-onset vision loss . DME occur blood vessel retina diabetic patient become leaky result unwanted fluid accumulation center vision know macula . If treat , lead blindness . Originally use treatment age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) , anti-VEGF drug increasingly use control leakage abnormal growth retinal blood vessel . Numerous question emerge follow usage anti-VEGF medication eye long-term effect drug intraocular pressure overall retinal perfusion . By recruit DR patient require anti-VEGF treatment DME , study answer whether long-term usage anti-VEGF result structural functional change retina .</detailed_description>
