	<brief_summary>There considerable evidence perinatal woman risk postpartum depression engage mental health service , even refer home visiting ( HV ) program , primary care physician , obstetrician , gynecologist . Thus , intervention deliver via alternative settings—e.g. , HV programs—are essential prevent onset major depression worsen depressive symptom among perinatal woman . This Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute ( PCORI ) fund project aim evaluate whether Mothers Babies ( MB ) group intervention , lead paraprofessional home visitor , efficacious usual care ( i.e. , home visiting without MB enhancement ) . It also examine MB , lead paraprofessional home visitor , inferior MB deliver mental health professional . The result study inform decision-making HV program regard provision MB perinatal woman risk develop major depression .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparing Effectiveness Clinicians Paraprofessionals Reduce Disparities Perinatal Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Aims : Aim # 1 conduct superiority trial compare efficacy MB deliver paraprofessional home visitor versus usual care ( i.e. , home visiting without MB ) patient-reported outcome , include depressive symptom , quality life , parent practice , engagement pleasant activity , relationship one 's partner . Aim # 2 conduct non-inferiority trial compare effectiveness MB delivered ( ) mental health clinician versus ( b ) paraprofessional home visitor . Aim # 3 evaluate whether effectiveness two version MB ( clinician lead vs. paraprofessional home visitor lead ) varies accord patient characteristic ( e.g. , race , ethnicity , first-time mother , and/or geographic type home visiting ( HV ) program ( i.e. , urban vs. rural ) . Aim # 4 examine feasibility acceptability MB deliver paraprofessional home visitor mental health clinician . Postpartum depression serious mental health disorder pose significant health mental health risk mother infant . Research suggest prevalence rate postpartum depression high among low-income woman among middle-or high-income woman . There also consistent evidence low-income woman less likely receive mental health service perinatal ( i.e. , pregnancy child 's first birthday ) period affluent counterpart due variety factor include stigma related mental health service use lack access community-based mental health provider . Postpartum depression particularly serious problem low-income woman , potential create two generation suffer , mother child . It estimate 10 % low-income infant mother major depression 50 % mother depressive symptom . Postpartum depression negative consequence maternal parenting practice . Compared woman suffer postpartum depression , depressed woman tend less positive , less spontaneous , less responsive infant . Postpartum depression link developmental delay among infant depressed mother , include social interaction difficulty , attachment insecurity , cognitive impairment . Home visiting ( HV ) program provide service perinatal woman one large avenue perinatal woman come attention service provider , make HV unique viable set deliver mental health service . Although professional HV model exist ( e.g. , Nurse-Family Partnership ) , HV program United States use paraprofessional . Previously , study investigator establish efficacy group-based intervention —the Mothers Babies ( MB ) Course—in prevent onset postpartum depression reduce depressive symptom lead mental health professional . However , date intervention lead non-health non-mental health professional demonstrate efficacy prevent onset worsen postpartum depression among low-income woman . This project attempt fill notable gap . The investigator conduct cluster randomize trial HV client receive either ) MB deliver mental health professional , b ) MB deliver paraprofessional home visitor , c ) usual home visiting service . This study design allow investigator conduct superiority trial compare efficacy MB deliver paraprofessional home visitor versus usual care . A superiority trial allow investigator generate efficacy data MB deliver paraprofessional home visitor . The study design also allow investigator conduct non-inferiority trial compare effectiveness MB deliver mental health professional versus paraprofessional home visitor . Should investigators find paraprofessional home visitor inferior mental health professional deliver intervention , HV program throughout United States able implement MB Course paraprofessional home visitors—an approach considerably efficient cost-effective employ mental health professional . This study bear community stakeholder ' need desire low-cost intervention could prevent onset worsen depression among low-income woman enrol HV program . Maternal depression enormous challenge face HV program . However , consistent evidence low-income woman exhibit depressive symptoms—including woman enrol HV programs—do access mental health treatment community . Lack available mental health professional , stigma seek mental health service , logistical challenge ( e.g. , childcare , transportation ) barrier face perinatal woman seek mental health service . For client access service , perinatal woman likely receive pharmacological treatment , despite fact vast majority perinatal woman prefer non-pharmacologic intervention . HV program ideal setting deliver mental health care perinatal woman mission stigmatize HV program tend trusted entity community serve . However , yet evidence-based intervention deliver paraprofessional ( home visitor ) , thereby limit HV program ' capacity meet need client need mental health service .</detailed_description>
