	<brief_summary>The main reason cancer-related mortality spread cancer cell distant site ( micrometastases ) . However , small group tumor cell metastasize acquire mechanism decrease immune response . Changes systemic inflammatory response tumor measure blood-based parameter . In particular , proportion neutrophyls- lymphocyte ( NL ) evaluate predict survival patient different type cancer . The first strategy treat colorectal cancer ( CCR ) complete resection lesion . Nevertheless , patient experience recurrence , probably due residual micrometastases . We demonstrate analysis resistance protein ( Tyms / MRP1 ) circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) may predict treatment response metastatic CCR patient ( mCRC ) . We also note CTCs kinetics show response therapy . Patients stage III disease colon / rectum , although show high cure rate , generally fall locally remotely study blood marker group patient still scarce . Primary Objective : To investigate cell find blood ( lymphocytes neutrophils CTCs ) verify help choice anti-neoplastic therapy patient advance colon rectum cancer . Secondary objective : - evaluate influence CTC kinetics response treatment patient advance colon/rectum cancer ; - check expression treatment resistance , invasion proliferation protein ( Tyms , TGF-βR , MMP-2 , β-gal , Ki-67 CD45 ) CTCs correlation response treatment ; - check mRNA expression gene observe immunocytochemistry CTCs correlation response treatment ; - quantify CTCs , neutrophils lymphocytes patient include study verify correlation among rate progression-free survival . Methods : collect 10 ml blood patient advance colon rectal cancer analysis CTCs , lymphocytes / neutrophil . CTCs isolate , quantify analyzed separation ISET method ( Rarecells/France ) . The marker analysis cell do immunocytochemistry gene expression assess RNAscope . The quantification lymphocytes/neutrophils make common blood count Delboni laboratory . Expected Results : We propose show count kinetics CTCs , also molecular characteristic , provide relevant information clinician . Hopefully , quantification neutrophil lymphocytes , able identify new prognostic blood biomarkers direct clinician best therapeutic choice .</brief_summary>
