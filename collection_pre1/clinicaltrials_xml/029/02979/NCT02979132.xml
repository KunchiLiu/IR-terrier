	<brief_summary>Conventional indirect indicator iron status , use serum red blood cell biomarkers , confound inflammation common infection therefore limit use population carry high burden infection inflammation , example woman reproductive age malaria endemic area develop country . Even without confound effect inflammation , current marker iron status insensitive small change dietary iron allow establish association dietary , lifestyle genetic factor iron balance . With new method base dilution previously administer equilibrate stable isotope signal , accurate measurement long-term oral iron balance absorption possible , allow estimation iron requirement potentially provide fundamental guidance supplementation fortification program healthy chronically inflamed/infected patient . In current study novel methodology validate generally healthy subject low iron status . The technique use assess dietary lifestyle determinant iron status compare effect iron balance iron status three distinct , commonly use iron intervention : food fortification iron ; oral iron supplementation , intravenous iron infusion .</brief_summary>
