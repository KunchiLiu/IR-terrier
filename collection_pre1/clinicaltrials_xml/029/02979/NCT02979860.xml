	<brief_summary>Enhancing child 's sleep duration and/or timing may represent novel approach weight regulation prevention T2DM . The propose study ass experimental change child 's sleep duration time affect weight regulation T2DM risk . Sixty African American child age 8-11 year old sleep approximately 9.5 hour less night enrol 4-arm randomized control pilot compare three experimental manipulation child 's sleep `` typical sleep '' ( TYP ) control . Experimental arm include : 1 ) increase time bed ( TIB ) 90 minutes/night ; 2 ) increase TIB 45 minutes/night ; 3 ) consistent ( CON ) sleep schedule ( change TIB ) . At baseline , 2- 4-week follow-up , participant weigh measured height , body fat assess ( bod pod ) , blood drawn ( follow overnight fast ) . The pilot provide important data potential role sleep combat disparity cardiometabolic risk . Primary aim : 1 ) determine effect change sleep change glucose regulation 2 ) determine effect change sleep additional measure glucose regulation adiposity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Eligible family provide consent/assent enrol five week study . All family complete assessment baseline , two week four week . Each assessment last one week child ask wear actigraph wrist ( measure sleep ) accelerometer hip ( measure physical activity ) . At end week family schedule visit research center first thing morning approximately one hour wake follow overnight fast . During visit , actigraphs accelerometer download data review family . Children weigh measure height body composition assess . To measure glucose regulation , child first 5 ml blood drawn fast state . They ingest glucose solution ( 1.75 g/kg ; maximum 75 g ) 2 minute , blood drawn ( 1.5 ml ) 120 min child consumes solution . At week 4 , 5 ml blood drawn fasting ; OGTT administer ( see note ) . Research staff also complete one-day dietary recall participants center-based assessment obtain information food consume previous 24-hour period . In addition , baseline assessment , parent complete questionnaire basic demographic information child sleep . It anticipate total time assessment take approximately 2.5-3 hour ( 1 hour 4 week ) . Following eligibility confirmation baseline assessment , family randomize one four protocol : 1 ) Enhance TIB 90 min/night ; 2 ) Enhance TIB 45 min/night ; 3 ) Regularize Sleep Schedule ; 4 ) Typical Sleep Schedule . Continuous glucose monitoring In voluntary subset randomly select child ( approximately n = 4/group ) 72-hour continuous glucose monitoring ( CGM ) perform . If child family agree participate CGM , come Center additional visit disposable subcutaneous glucose-sensing device connect battery-operated recorder insert subcutaneously ( thin tube surface skin ) . This sensor measure glucose every ten second record average value every five minute .</detailed_description>
