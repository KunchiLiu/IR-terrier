	<brief_summary>The aim propose study investigate effectiveness interactive , virtual reality ( VR ) train program pilot compare standard care . The study randomize control trial ( RCT ) consist 60 pilot randomize one two group : standard physiotherapy medical care v standard care VR training . Outcome measure include subjective score pain intensity global perceived effect ; objective measure range motion ( ROM ) , neck motion velocity , motion accuracy ; functional measure day ground due neck pain . Data analyze use ANOVA within group analysis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aim propose study investigate effectiveness interactive , virtual reality ( VR ) train program pilot compare standard care . The propose intervention program include train neck range motion , control , accuracy coordination expect reduce prevalence operational impact neck pain intervention group effectively standard care alone . The propose study design randomize , control trial ( RCT ) . Sixty fighter helicopter pilot randomize two group , receive either standard physiotherapy medical care standard care addition interactive , dynamic , controlled training ( self-exercise program ) VR address fast , accurate head control require fly task . Subjective outcome measure include pain intensity global perceived effect . Objective measure include range motion , motion velocity accuracy . The functional measure include day ground due neck pain . Statistical analysis use independent , repeated measure ANOVA parameter , within group . Post hoc comparison , include several preplanned contrast , perform assess difference treatment , stability change time , group . The relationship risk factor performance failure assess use multivariate logistic regression analysis . This study first Israeli Air Force evaluate type comprehensive , functional intervention program . Such research dramatically advance military 's health care approach neck pain , may apply population outside Israeli Defence Force ( IDF ) . This study may serve step stone research relate diagnosis , treatment , prevention method pilot 's active service .</detailed_description>
