	<brief_title>Treatment Intermediate Vaginal Microbiota With Vaginal Lactobacillus Casei Rhamnosus Improve Pregnancy Outcome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite recent achievement perinatal care , prevention preterm delivery ( PTD ) remain major challenge modern obstetrics . Healthy vaginal flora , dominate Lactobacillus specie ( spp . ) , play important role protection genital infection , consider frequent cause PTD . Imbalances vaginal flora cause reduction proportion Lactobacillus spp . lead overgrowth mixed anaerobic bacteria , ultimately result bacterial vaginosis ( BV ) . Since effect treat pregnant woman abnormal vaginal flora introduce , BV gain interest well-known risk factor ascend infection subsequent PTD . However , overall risk reduction PTD antibiotic treatment abnormal flora disprove large well-designed study general obstetrical population . At present , little known role intermediate vaginal flora , either regarded transition healthy abnormal flora transition abnormal flora back healthy vaginal microbiota . The intermediate vaginal flora constitute highly heterogeneous group may may include vaginal Lactobacillus spp . may may characterise presence anaerobic bacteria . In 2007 , meta-analysis report presence intermediate vaginal flora associate PTD , late miscarriage , maternal neonatal infection , perinatal mortality . In contrast , observational study Hay et al.reported high rate late miscarriage ( 16-24 gestational week ) woman intermediate vaginal flora examination 16 gestational week . Additionally , another study report association PTD partial BV , define streak BV flora smear area normal flora . Latest research report association intermediate vaginal flora PTD . In one previous study , intermediate flora identify examine screen smear 529/8421 ( 6.3 % ) woman . In group , 349/529 ( 66 % ) woman Nugent score 4 , 94/529 ( 17.8 % ) Nugent score 5 , 86/529 ( 16.2 % ) Nugent score 6 . In woman Nugent score 4 , 232/349 ( 66.5 % ) woman assign Lactobacilli group . The Non-Lactobacilli group consist 117/349 ( 33.5 % ) woman Nugent score 4 due total absence bacterial colonisation , include Lactobacillus spp . The preterm delivery rate significantly low Lactobacilli Non-Lactobacilli group On follow-up smear , bacterial vaginosis rate 9 % Lactobacilli 7.8 % Non-Lactobacilli group . Hence , accord retrospective study , absence vaginal Lactobacillus specie bacterial colonisation increase risk preterm delivery low birth weight woman intermediate vaginal flora early pregnancy . In currently present trial , investigator aim evaluate treatment intermediate vaginal flora first trim pregnancy vaginal lactobacillus restore normal vaginal microbiota therewith reduce rate PTD . At investigator Department , pregnancy care include prenatal consultation , woman register planned delivery department 10 + 0 ( 10 week plus 0 day ) 16 + 0 ( 16 week plus 0 day ) gestational week . Women underwent routine screening asymptomatic vaginal infection characterization due Nugent score . All woman except normal flora ( Nugent score 0 3 ) ask undergo follow-up smear 14 + 0 ( 14 week plus 0 day ) 22 + 0 ( 22 week plus 0 day ) gestational week department . Vaginal smear obtain vaginal fluid collection sterile swabs lateral vaginal wall posterior fornix vagina . Both first control smear . All smear Gram-stained microscopically analyze one four biomedical laboratory assistant , specialize gynecological cytopathology , laboratory certify accord DIN EN ISO 9001:2008 . Nugent score 0 3 consider indicate normal vaginal flora , 4 6 indicate intermediate vaginal flora , 7 10 indicate BV . The present study follow prospective randomize observer-blinded mono-centric design . After obtain result vaginal swab According Nugent scoring system , two group assign : ( ) pregnant woman intermediate vaginal flora Nugent score 4 vaginal lactobacillus ( Control Group ) , versus ( ii ) pregnant woman intermediate vaginal flora Nugent score 4 without vaginal lactobacillus ( Study Group ) . Therapy assign due protocol . Each group divide study control group . Patients study group treat muco-adhesive slow release vaginal tablet contain 876,9 mg Lactobacillus casei rhamnosus ( Lcr regenerans ) concentration 107 CFU/ml ( Groups A + C ) . The treatment duration 8 day two tablet every 4th day . Patients control group undergo treatment ( Groups B + D ) . A vaginal control smear obtain 4-6 week follow first study visit . The primary outcome parameter recovery normal vaginal flora ( Nugent score 0 3 ) . Secondary outcome parameter include ( ) gestational age delivery , record term delivery 37 + 0 gestational week , ( ii ) rate PTD , define spontaneous delivery 36 + 6 gestational week , due preterm premature rupture membrane and/or preterm labor , ( iii ) neonatal birthweight , define weight time delivery , ( iv ) rate live birth , define delivery PTD infant Apgar score 1 minute &gt; 0 .</detailed_description>
