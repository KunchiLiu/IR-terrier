	<brief_summary>This study TRC105 combination standard dose pazopanib compare single agent pazopanib patient angiosarcoma amenable curative intent surgery ( e.g. , metastatic bulky disease , disease surgical resection would carry unacceptable risk patient ) receive pazopanib TRC105 previously .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A RANDOMIZED PHASE 3 TRIAL OF TRC105 AND PAZOPANIB VERSUS PAZOPANIB ALONE IN PATIENTS WITH ADVANCED ANGIOSARCOMA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TRC105 ( carotuximab ) monoclonal antibody endoglin ( CD105 ) , essential angiogenic target highly expressed tumor vessel distinct VEGFR . Endoglin also express directly tumor cell angiosarcoma upregulated follow VEGF inhibition . TRC105 inhibit angiogenesis , tumor growth metastases preclinical model complement activity bevacizumab multi-kinase inhibitor target VEGFR . Pazopanib oral inhibitor multiple receptor tyrosine kinase , include vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ( VEGFR ) -1 , VEGFR-2 , VEGFR-3 therapeutic plasma concentration . These receptor implicate pathologic angiogenesis , tumor growth , cancer progression . By target non-VEGF pathway upregulated follow VEGF inhibition , TRC105 potential complement VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKIs ) could represent major advance treatment angiosarcoma . Together , use TRC105 pazopanib may result effective angiogenesis inhibition improve clinical efficacy see pazopanib alone .</detailed_description>
