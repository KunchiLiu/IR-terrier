	<brief_title>Apatinib Esophageal Squamous Cell Cancer After Failure Standard Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Esophageal cancer one common malignant tumor China . In Asian country , esophageal squamous cell carcinoma main pathological type esophageal carcinoma . Prognosis esophageal squamous cell carcinoma usually poor surgery radical treatment . Cisplatin ( DDP , cisplatin ) , 5 - Fluorouracil ( 5 - Fluorouracil , 5 - FU ) taxane adopt chemotherapy agent , efficacy rate 33 % -40 % first-line treatment metastatic recurrent esophageal squamous carcinoma median overall survival 6-10 month . New agent need . Apatinib Mesylate small molecule VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor . The anti-tumor mechanism Apatinib inhibit angiogenesis malignancy inhibit VEGFR . Apatinib Mesylate approve CFDA ( China Food Drug Administration ) treatment advance gastric cancer . In previous clinical practice , observed part patient esophageal squamous cell carcinoma resistant conventional treatment benefit Apatinib Mesylate . Based research situation mention , decide conduct phase II clinical trial explore efficacy safety Apatinib Mesylate treat recurrent metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma failure conventional treatment . An exploratory molecular marker analysis perform order find beneficial population Apatinib Mesylate .</detailed_description>
