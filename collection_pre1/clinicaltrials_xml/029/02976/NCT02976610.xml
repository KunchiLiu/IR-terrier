	<brief_title>Clinical Study Novel Hemolysis Point Care Test Emergency Department .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In blood sample process , preanalytical phase accountable vast majority laboratory test error . Among preanalytical error , hemolysis frequent error sample rejection . Recollection blood patient cause extra suffering , increase turn-around-time hence delay treatment , unnecessary extra cost health care system . Here novel method hemolysis point care detection ( H-POCT ) evaluate . The single use test attach blood sample direct conjunction sample process . Patients select consecutive selection emergency department blood test order physician meet inclusion criterion . Patients randomize one two group . All health care professional participate study attend standard education program operate H-POCT . If Allocated control group , n : 750 , nurse enrol nurse perform blood sample accord routine . If allocate intervention group , n : 750 , nurse enrol nurse perform blood sample accord routine screen Lithium Heparin vacuum tube . ( one analyze : Liver status , Electrolytes Troponin T. ) If hemolysis point care test ( H-poct ) indicate positive test result Lithium Heparin vacuum tube attach H-poct discard new sample collect screened hemolysis user receive negative sample hemolyzed . This study take place county hospital 430 bed emergency department treat 59000 patient yearly .</detailed_description>
