	<brief_summary>The present phase I trial evaluate feasibility postoperative stereotactic hypofractionated external beam radiation therapy deliver patient underwent radical prostatectomy adverse pathological feature early biochemical failure . Modern computer-driven technology enable implementation ultra-high hypofractionated Image-Guided Radiotherapy ( IGRT ) safely . Eligible patient study : - Adenocarcinoma prostate treat radical prostatectomy ( type radical prostatectomy permit include retropubic , perineal , laparoscopic robotically assist ; time limit date radical prostatectomy ) - Pathologic ( p ) T3 disease , positive margin ( ) , Gleason score 8-10 , seminal vesicle involvement - Undetectable post-radical prostatectomy PSA become detectable increase 2 subsequent measurement ( PSA &gt; 0.1 - ≤ 2.0 ng/mL ) - Life expectancy : 10 year - ECOG performance status 0 -1 - No distant metastasis , base follow workup within 60 day prior registration - Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) pelvis - PSMA/Choline Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) exclude systemic disease patient biochemical recurrence - Patients androgen deprivation therapy - Ability understand willingness sign study-specific informed consent prior study . Patients enrol study undergo image-guided , volumetric intensity-modulated arc radiotherapy ( IGRT-VMAT ) state-of-the-art treatment-planning quality assurance procedure emphasis normal tissue spar delivery accuracy via use device ensure stability beam location reproducibility .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The present study evaluate feasibility postoperative stereotactic hypofractionated external beam radiation therapy deliver patient underwent radical prostatectomy adverse pathological feature early biochemical failure . Regardless two setting ( adjuvant salvage ) , external beam radiation therapy prostate cancer usually protract course , since total dose 66 Gy 70 Gy need effective . At typical rate 1.8 Gy 2.0 Gy per treatment , take approximately 35 treatment course 7 week complete , costly extremely time consume . On hand , α/β ratio prostate cancer estimate low 1.5 Gy , significantly low 3 Gy value estimate late complications.Therefore , delivery equivalent total dose 2 Gy/fraction ( normalized total dose ) prostate use hypofractionation regimen , part practical benefit reduce treatment cost number session patient radiotherapy department , spar effect early respond normal tissue reduction total dose deliver , well reduction incidence late complication . Trials investigate clinical toxicity outcomes moderate hypofractionation schedule curative set reach sufficient follow-up show similar efficacy toxicity conventionally fractionate regimen . Stereotactic body radiation therapy , SBRT , short end hypofractionation spectrum . It accomplish five treatment . With pinpoint accuracy , many Institutions currently use primary treatment dose 9 Gy per treatment , lead excellent outcome least early time points.Patients enrol study undergo image-guided , volumetric intensity-modulated arc radiotherapy ( IGRT-VMAT ) state-of-the-art treatment-planning quality assurance procedure emphasis normal tissue spar delivery accuracy via use device ensure stability beam location reproducibility.A rectal balloon air fill use anatomical reproducibility , urethral catheter load beacon transponder use ensure set-up reproducibility online target track . Previously untreated patient underwent radical prostatectomy adverse pathologic finding enrol phase I study , consist 31 Gy ( 5 fraction 6.2 Gy ) , respectively , deliver 1-week period 5 fraction per week . This dosage correspond 68.2 Gy ( α/βratio estimate 1.5 Gy ) , compare 52.7 Gy ( α/β estimate 4 Gy ) conventional schedule . In developed early biochemical failure radiation schedule consist 32.5 Gy ( 5 fraction 6.5 Gy ) , respectively , deliver 1-week period 5 fraction per week . This dosage correspond 74.3 Gy ( α/β ratio estimate 1.5 Gy ) , compare 56.9 Gy ( α/β estimate 4 Gy ) conventional schedule . Patients follow one month post-treatment every 3 month 12 month ( +/- 4 week ) every 6 month thereafter . Acute chronic toxicity evaluation focus , though exclusively , urinary , rectal sexual function assess validated EPIC questionnaire . Serum PSA value draw schedule clinical follow-up . The study continuously monitor minimum 5 year . In event unexpected severe ( grade ≥3 ) toxicities observed one treatment regimens , trial terminate accord standard stopping rule : &gt; 3/first 10 , &gt; 5/first 25 patient .</detailed_description>
