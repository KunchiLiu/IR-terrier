	<detailed_description>PURPOSE The purpose multi-centre randomized clinical trial compare two bowel preparation regimens patient fail cleanse colon index colonoscopy . Although many clinical trial already exist examine optimal bowel preparation colonoscopy general , surprisingly none address patient fail bowel preparation past . Failure achieve bowel preparation result complex factor , include underlie colonic dysmotility , co-morbidities , concurrent medication usage rarely result patient non-compliance . ( 1 ) Given frequency inadequate bowel preparation , negative impact colonoscopy quality , increase risk adverse event , need repeat procedure , important public health need exist address question urgently . ( 1 ) This study use many methodology investigator ongoing Canadian multicenter study title , `` The Bowel CLEAnsing : National initiative ( B-CLEAN ) `` small scale answer question . BACKGROUND Adequate bowel preparation prerequisite high quality colonoscopy need maximize visualization colonic mucosa . ( 1-4 ) Unfortunately , inadequate bowel preparation common report occur 4 % 17 % case . ( 5-12 ) Procedures poor preparation likely incomplete , adverse event , less likely detect polyp . ( 1 , 9 , 13 ) Repeat colonoscopy within one year show 36 % miss rate advance adenoma patient . ( 12 ) Recognizing importance high quality colonoscopy , Cancer Care Ontario provincial health authority track adequacy rate bowel preparation . In case poor bowel preparation , colonoscopy must repeat , expose patient another invasive procedure add additional cost healthcare system . Although health economic data regard colonoscopy utilization Canada sparse , illustrative example United States possible . Assuming 14.2 million screening colonoscopy perform annually United States ( 14 ) 5 % inadequate bowel preparation ( 6 , 8 ) , total 710,000 colonoscopy repeat cost $ 763 million dollar , base per case cost $ 1,075 . ( 15 ) This likely underestimation true cost due exclusion non-screening colonoscopy calculation use low colonoscopy cost estimate base Nationwide Colonoscopy Program Uninsured . ( 15 ) There numerous definition inadequate bowel preparation term 's lack specificity contribute varied incidence inadequate bowel preparation report literature . The Boston Bowel Preparation Scale ( BBPS ) user friendly validate measure base three colonic segment score ( right , transverse , leave , score 0 - 3 ) sum total score 0 - 9 . ( 16 , 17 ) ( Appendix A ) Adequacy recently formally define large study involve 2,516 patient undergoing colonoscopy 36 centre total score ≥6 and/or segment score ≥2 . ( 18 ) The optimal bowel preparation use repeat colonoscopy patient fail initial preparation unknown . However , combination stimulant , bisacodyl , large volume electrolyte fluid balance osmotic laxative , PEG , often use . In recent case series , Ibanez et al . ( 19 ) identify 83 patient inadequate bowel preparation index colonoscopy . 51 patient agree repeat colonoscopy use 'intensive ' regimen consist low fibre diet , bisacodyl , 3L split dose polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) . Using regimen , 90 % adequate bowel preparation second colonoscopy . However , bowel preparation index colonoscopy give split dose manner majority patient , standard practice due superior cleansing , lack control group make accurate assessment efficacy impossible . ( 1 ) In another study , patient inadequate bowel preparation split dose PEG ( 4L ) offer repeat colonoscopy day ingestion another 2L PEG colonoscopy 1 week later use low fibre diet , bisacodyl , 4L split dose PEG . ( 20 ) There difference adequacy bowel preparation although 20 % case still inadequate lack randomization blind threaten validity result . To date , consensus exist regard optimal bowel preparation regimen use patient inadequate cleanse due absence clinical trial . Given 4 % 17 % colonoscopy inadequate bowel preparation , significant public health need address issue . ( 5-12 , 21-23 ) A highly efficacious yet tolerable bowel preparation regimen need patient ensure adequate cleanse next procedure . The objective multi-centre randomized clinical trial compare efficacy two regimen achieve adequate bowel preparation fail cleanse index colonoscopy . PROJECT DESCRIPTION 3.1 Study Design , Randomization , Blinding This multi-centre randomized clinical trial compare two bowel preparation regimens patient already fail bowel preparation index colonoscopy , define inadequate visualization detect lesion &gt; 5 mm require shorten colonoscopy interval result . This clinical definition fail bowel preparation choose instead BBPS since latter may available index colonoscopy depend endoscopist . However , possible , BBPS index colonoscopy record . A total four centre original B-CLEAN study group agree participate ( Appendix E ) . Subjects randomized one 2 arm ( see ' 3.2 Selection Bowel Preparation Regimens ' detail ) . Randomization perform centrally use Research Electronic Data Capture ( REDCap ) 1:1 allocation block vary size stratify site . In addition , data entry perform online REDCap . Blinding endoscopist strictly enforce . Endoscopists require remain blind subject 's bowel preparation complete bowel cleanliness section CRF . Subjects ask discuss bowel preparation endoscopy unit staff except research personnel colonoscopy preparation rating complete endoscopist . Unfortunately , blind patient ( ie . double blinding ) impossible due volume difference two bowel preparation regimen . 3.2 Selection Bowel Preparation Regimens Regimen A : 4L PegLyte + 15 mg bisacodyl Regimen B : 6L PegLyte + 15 mg bisacodyl There standard bowel preparation utilized colonoscopy fail bowel preparation . Regimen A adapted Ibanez et al . ( 19 ) use regimen consist 3L polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) 10 mg bisacodyl reasonable effectiveness . In study , 4L PEG use instead 3L avoid reduce amount PEG consume originally prepped 4L PegLyte index colonoscopy . 15 mg bisacodyl use instead 10 mg consistency dose use BiPegLyte . This regimen modestly intensive standard bowel preparation due additional 2L PEG compare BiPegLyte 15 mg bisacodyl compare 4L PegLyte . Regimen B adapt Kim et al . ( 20 ) intensive yet tolerable regimen . In regimen , 6L PEG combine 15 mg bisacodyl . 3.3 Bowel Preparation &amp; Colonoscopy Subjects randomize 1:1 allocation either regimen A B . Regardless randomization , subject instruct follow low fibre diet 2 day follow clear fluid diet 24 hour prior schedule colonoscopy . The time amount PEG subject consume depend randomization . ( APPENDIX B ) To optimize patient adherence , participant receive handout specific bowel preparation instruction base randomization . All colonoscopy perform within 12 week randomization within 2 week index colonoscopy ( ie . washout period index bowel preparation ) . Procedures perform accord local standard operating procedure . All participate endoscopists complete standardize training calibration use Boston Bowel Preparation Scale prior start study http : //www.bmc.org/gastroenterology/research.htm . A record training send coordinate centre . For subject present colonoscopy randomization ( ie . forgot appointment ) , may remain study prepped regimen long next colonoscopy schedule within next two week . For subject decline ongoing study participation , withdraw follow physician . 3.4 Baseline Data Collection 1 . Age 2 . Gender 3 . Weight 4 . Height 5 . Primary Language 6 .

Assuming 70 % adequacy among randomized regimen A , 87.5 % adequacy among randomized regimen B , significance 0.05 , power 0.8 , 85 patient require group ( total = 170 ) . An adequacy rate 70 % select base exist literature . ( 19 , 20 ) Additional factor consider arriving figure include lack split dose use index colonoscopy ( 19 ) , inadequate intake PEG index colonoscopy ( 20 ) , performance second colonoscopy within week first . ( 20 ) An adequacy rate 87.5 % select base 25 % relative increase adequacy consider clinically significant . Based target sample size 170 conservative 15 % dropout , 196 subject require study . Descriptive statistic report mean ( SD ) , median ( range ) , proportion appropriate . Data analyze intention-to-treat hypothesis test perform t-test , chi-square , Fisher 's exact test appropriate . Pre-planned secondary analysis include per-protocol analysis , stratification timing colonoscopy ( ie . morning versus afternoon procedure ) , stratification initial bowel preparation use .</detailed_description>
