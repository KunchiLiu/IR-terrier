	<detailed_description>Studies show educational intervention patient near end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) delay need dialysis increase likelihood patient choose in-home vs. in-center dialysis . Given high cost in-center hemodialysis compare in-home strategy , peritoneal dialysis , effort increase use in-home dialysis modality likely cost-effective . Moreover , study educational intervention long-term follow-up , one study suggest patient expose educational intervention improve long-term survival dialysis . The long-term goal improve clinical patient-centered outcome patient transition Chronic Kidney Disease Stage ( CKD ) IV V dialysis-requiring ESRD . The short-term goal pilot project evaluate feasibility deliver digital-enabled ESRD education patient CKD stage IV V ( eGFR &lt; 30ml/min/1.73m2 , yet dialysis ) clinical care . The investigator provide education form in-person nurse advice , online digital content include video , online message nurse , moderate patient group peer mentor . The main objective educational program 1 ) Increase awareness option , 2 ) Prioritize option base patient lifestyle value , 3 ) Build confidence modality decision . The investigator develop individualize , digitalize educational content ( include video , text illustration ) patient CKD increase awareness ESRD care option include in-home hemodialysis , peritoneal dialysis choose dialysis . Patients enroll month-long program access educational app , include lifestyle modality educational content online message access nurse 1 1 discussion , patient mentor 1 1 discussion , patient group group mentorship exercise . The investigator pilot material patient high risk progression dialysis evaluate primary outcome whether able complete program make modality choice . Secondary outcome include assessment determine intervention 's impact patient dialysis modality awareness likelihood choose home-dialysis modality . At end study , investigator provide insight report study participant ' doctor survey doctor ascertain perspective usefulness educational program patient ' care .</detailed_description>
