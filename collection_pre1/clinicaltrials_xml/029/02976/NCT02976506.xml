	<brief_title>Unsupervised Physical Activity Elderly</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The present study approve Human Animal Ethics Committee institution participant randomize participate sign informed consent form . A population elderly hypertensive patient register reference center hypertension treatment select . The sample size calculate consider test power 80 % significance level 5 % estimate difference observe within BP value 7 mmHg systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) 4 mmHg diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) . The sample calculate 25 participant group select 20 % case loss . An electronic chart create number patient randomize control ( CG ) intervention group ( IG ) . The IG include USPAP control group keep usual care service include orientation perform PA accord World Health Organization recommendation . Before begin protocol clinical laboratorial data collect include : weight , height , waist circumference , fast glucose , hemoglobin A1C lipid profile . In addition health-related quality life assess Short Form 36-item Health Survey ( SF-36 ) . The SF-36 Questionnaire include one multi-item scale ass eight health concept : 1 ) functional capacity ; 2 ) physical aspect ; 3 ) pain ; 4 ) general health status ; 5 ) vitality ; 6 ) social aspect ; 7 ) emotional aspect ; 8 ) mental health . The score health concept range 0 100 , zero mean bad general health state one hundred best health state . All patient underwent physical test evaluate physical fitness : cardiorespiratory fitness test ( Cooper Test ) abdominal resistance test . Patients classify accord Physical Aptitude Classification Tables Users Public Parks . The BP assess office BP measurement use OMRON - HEM 705 CPÂ® semi-automatic device accord VI Brazilian Hypertension Guidelines ( BHG ) . Home blood pressure also perform follow technics office measurement accord III Brazilian Guidelines Home Blood Pressure Monitoring 3 measurement morning fast 3 night dinner four consecutive day . The physical activity prescription individualize patient would doubt regard execution perform exercise without presence prescribe professional . The prescribed physical activity aerobic walk chosen one . The activity prescribed plan , structure repetitive way aim maintain improve one component physical fitness . To achieve goal patient attend 2 supervised session take place one week period non-consecutive day . They instruct perform training least 3 time week 30 minute moderate intensity 40 60 % reserve heart rate mean walk slightly breathless able pronounce complete phrase accord VI BHG recommendation . The total number session prescribe 36 throughout 12 week . The minimum 30 session need result could validate . Health educational strategy use simultaneously data collection improve adherence group . Motivational action use specific IG . Weekly phone call carry IG order know number session perform week , duration practice total number step session . All participant receive pedometer diary register activity . Safety assess consider : need interrupt training due lesion , fall , incapacitate pain acute event related training would require medical assistance . After 12 week participant reevaluate procedure repeat evaluate effect intervention . Data collect analyzed software Statistical Package Social Science , version 23.0 , Chicago , USA . Qualitative variable present absolute number percentage comparison make Qui Square Test Exact Fisher Test . Proportion comparison group perform apply Wilcoxon Test . Quantitative variable initially analyze term distribution Shapiro-Wilk test . Mean variable comparison perform T-Student test pair unpaired sample . The result present mean value standard deviation p value &lt; 0,05 consider significant .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>The inclusion criterion : 60 year old , stable BP last three month , change pharmacological treatment last six month sedentary behavior ( nonparticipation kind physical activity least 2 month ) . The exclusion criterion consider : uncontrolled diabetes congestive heart failure acute myocardial infarction last six month stroke last six month rehabilitation previously diagnose chronic renal failure acute infectious disease recent systemic pulmonary embolism pulmonary hypertension BP high 159 x 99 mmHg neuromuscular musculoskeletal articular disorder diagnose treated clinical evaluation restrain PA situation prevent patient walk . Those criterion verify patient ' medical chart .</criteria>
