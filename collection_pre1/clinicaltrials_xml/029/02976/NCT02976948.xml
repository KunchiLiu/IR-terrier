	<brief_summary>Main objective : To compare efficacy new strategy Next Generation Sequencing ( NGS ) versus classical Sanger strategy , diagnosis patient refer laboratory suspect systemic autoinflammatory disease ( SAID ) . Secondary objective : - Compare 6 month impact strategy establishment effective treatment SAID follow genetic result . - Compare distribution different form SAID find genetic diagnostic strategy ( NGS v classic method ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation New Sequencing Strategy Autoinflammatory Siseases ( BIOSAID )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Systemic autoinflammatory disease ( SAID ) include broad spectrum pathology innate immunity . In recent year , numerous publication show involvement new gene disease , highlight new pathophysiological pathway ( inflammasome , NFkB : nuclear factor-kappa B , interferon ) new target therapy ( biotherapy advantageously replace non-specific anti-inflammatory drug ) . Current laboratory diagnostic strategy base Sanger method , gold standard date , allow sequential analysis gene ( usually 1 4 ) . The nonspecific nature clinical presentation disease , increase number gene involve low diagnostic yield obtain , make essential develop new strategy , efficient , patient benefit soon possible treatment suit pathology soon gene involve identify . The investigator develop validated genetic laboratory new method base Next Generation Sequencing ( NGS ) . A panel 32 known candidate SAID gene , simultaneously analyze within time compatible diagnosis . The investigator wish highlight benefit new strategy .</detailed_description>
