	<detailed_description>End-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) associate multiple comorbidities cardiovascular disease , anemia , mineral bone disorder , malnutrition , body wasting , muscle loss ( sarcopenia ) , neurological problem infection result poor survival . Important promoter obstacle enhance generation reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) , systemic inflammation , acquire immunodeficiency ( 9 , 10 ) impair glucose insulin homeostasis ( 11 ) . Systemic inflammation oxidative stress ESRD induce activation innate immune system involve monocyte , macrophage , granulocyte cellular constituent ( endothelial cell activation ) well depletion natural regulatory T cell impairs ability suppress inflammation .The concomitant reduce humoral immunity favor depletion antigen present dendritic cell , lower CD44/CD8 T cell ratio , depletion naïve central memory T cell , diffuse B cell lymphopenia impair phagocytic ability monocyte PMNs ( 12 ) . Insulin resistance ( IR ) participate pathogenesis multiple metabolic cardiovascular disturbance ( 13 ) important factor accelerate muscle protein degradation ESRD ( 14 ) . Underlying mechanisms IR metabolic inflammation , particular elevate LPS level . In pathogenesis uremic syndrome alter intestinal function seem important contributor . While normal gut microbiota play prominent role maintenance health disease prevention , change composition associate numerous disease obesity , type 2 diabetes , cardiovascular disturbance auto-immune disease . In ESRD metabolic alteration uremia result quantitative qualitative change bacterial flora overgrowth pathobionts ( 1 ) . Due concomitant disruption intestinal barrier function , noxious luminal product translocate body 's internal milieu ( Fig.2 ) . The passage include whole bacteria ( go mesenteric lymph node ) , endotoxins/ lipoproteinlipase ( LPS ) ( cell wall component bacteria ) noxious luminal product induce persistent local ( gut ) systemic inflammation.The process intensify intestinal generation several pro-inflammatory uremic toxin indoxyl sulfate , p-cresyl sulfate trimethyamine-N-oxide ( 2 ) .The accumulation compound correlate systemic inflammation , protein waste accelerate cardiovascular complication hemodialysis patient ( 3 ) . Short-chain fatty acid ( SCFA ) produce colon distal small intestine anaerobic bacteria follow fermentation complex carbohydrate . The 3 major compound acetic acid , butyric propionic acid . SCFA contribute health gut ( microbiome mucosa ) host . They show exert anti-inflammatory , anti-cancer , antibacterial antidiabetic effect . Lower value dysbiotic gut contribute various disease colitis , type 2 diabetes , rheumatoid disease multiple sclerosis . Supplementation SCFA exert anti-inflammatory action intestinal epithelial cell ( 5 ) cardiovascular system ( 6 ) . They also positively influence auto- immune reaction /diseases ( 7 , 8 ) . In particular SCFA enhance formation regulatory T cell colon critical regulating intestinal inflammation ( 15 ) . Also effector T cell Il-10 implicate ( 16 ) . Likewise SCFA involve control body weight insulin sensitivity ( 17 ) , cholesterol synthesis ( 18 ) retardation progressive CKD . In patient maintenance hemodialysis ( MHD ) diet high fiber content , favor intestinal SCFA formation ( 19 ) , lower plasma level colon-derived solute indoxyl sulfate possibly p-cresol sulfate ( 20 ) reduce inflammation , cardiovascular disease all-cause mortality CKD/ESRD patient ( 21 ) . However , ESRD consumption fiber rich diet limit due risk hyperpotassemia . In addition frequent antibiotic therapy , application phosphate binder iron therapy alters gut microbiome . The following mechanism propose action SCFA : G‑protein-coupled receptor GPR 41 GPR 43 ( free fatty acid receptor FFAR 3 2 ) , GPR 109a , Olfr78 , inhibition histone deacetylases ( HDAC ) stimulation histone acetyltransferase ( HAT ) activity ( 22 , 23 ) . n study want investigate MHD patient whether treatment SCFA form sodium propionate ( SP ) modulate systemic inflammation , insulin resistance accumulation intestinal uremic toxin . SP chemically compose carboxylic acid moiety small hydrocarbon chain three carbon atom ( black ball ) , two oxygen ( red ball ) white hydrogen atom . SP involved effect short chain fatty acid include inhibition intestinal hepatocyte lipid synthesis ( 24 ) , lower fast glycemia ( 25 , 26 ) protection diet-induced obesity ( 27 ) . SP also regulate colonic T-reg cell homeostasis ( 28 ) exerts mark anti-inflammatory action include intestinal epithelial cell macrophage ( 29 ) well neutrophils , colon cell colon culture ( 30 ) . It improve experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis ( 31 ) experimental acute renal failure ( 32 ) . In addition antibacterial effect document ( 33 , 34 ) . The patient maintenance hemodialysis receive food additive sodium propionate daily intake 2 x 500 mg form capsule ( Propicum ) 12 week . The demographic information blood chemistry collect study , 6 , 12 16 week drug administration . The project last one year . The planned patient group comprise 15 patient maintenance hemodialysis .</detailed_description>
