	<brief_title>Efficacy Manual Therapy Exercise Patients With Shoulder Adhesive Capsulitis . A Randomized Clinical Trial .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adhesive capsulitis shoulder painful entity characterize stiffness shoulder joint . There exist different clinical trial related pathology , however lack information efficacy methodology use manual therapy treatment remain unclear , well therapeutic exercise treatment . Furthermore , duration improvement different conservative treatment also unknown . Besides , little known factor correlate pain function.Thus , biomechanic psychosocial factor together ultrasound measurement blood glucose concentration ( see `` outcome secondary measure '' section ) analyze treatment , nine month follow . Results spread show short term effect long term effect different publication . Hence , aim study twofold : ) To analyze efficacy manual therapy therapeutic exercise patient shoulder adhesive capsulitis ; ii ) To correlate pain function ultrasonography , biomechanic psychosocial factor , well blood glucose concentration , treatment propose nine month follow . Method This study design clinical trial , two randomise parallel group compare two different conservative intervention ( MT v MT+E ) ( See `` Arms Interventions '' section ) . It carry different Hospital primary care center patient suffer adhesive capsulitis shoulder ask participate project . If participant eligible include study . All participant sign inform consent show whole project write ( informative sheet ) speech physiotherapist charge . Once include study definitely , factor detail ( see `` outcome measure '' section ) measure . Also , every factor correlate shoulder pain function . This way , investigator could predict factor correlate . Furthermore , significant correlation find , factor could use predictor monitor tool patient shoulder adhesive capsulitis treat</detailed_description>
