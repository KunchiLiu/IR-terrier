	<detailed_description>The use ultrasound guidance performance peripheral nerve block improve success rate , shorten performance time reduces risk inadvertent vascular puncture . Safe effective procedure performance require operator make series real-time , high stake decision relevant interpretation sonographic anatomy subsequent nerve visualization , needle-to-nerve guidance , needle-to-nerves approximation local anesthetic deposition . Teaching novice perform ultrasound-guided nerve block include render assessment component skill interpretation sonographic anatomy , consistent needle image correct placement local anesthetic . Learning teach ultrasound-related motor skill challenge within current landscape medical training education . Simulated learning advocate facilitate deliberate practice oppose repeat practice . Simulation e-learning flexible training modality , facilitate procedural skill rehearsal safe environment , free risk patient , permit real time feedback . Deliberate practice feedback simulate environment may accelerate rate skill acquisition . Feedback predictor effective learning useful tool novice learn new skill . However summative feedback superior concurrent feedback procedural skill acquisition simulate clinical training skill retention . The characteristic feedback , influence effect learning , include timing , content , initiate ( elicits ) format motivation apply delivery . Feedback positively influence skill acquisition novice learner . How trainees adopt objective versus subjective feedback remain largely undetermined . The investigator hypothesize feedback base previously develop validate metric improve novice ' learn procedural skill . The objective study determine effect structure , objective terminal feedback novice ' performance skill ultrasonography part ultrasound-guided axillary brachial plexus block . Methods : With institutional ethical approval obtain write informed consent , 12 anesthesia trainee invite participate prospective , randomize blind study . Inclusion criterion : i. trainee Irish national anesthesia train program allocate Cork teach hospital ( CUH ) ii . perform 5 ultrasound-guided peripheral nerve block time participation . Each participant answer test ascertain visuospatial perceptual ability ( card rotation , cube comparison map plan test ) . Each participant provide baseline information prior participation ) age ii ) gender iii ) handedness iv ) Years since graduate medical school v ) number estimate number previously perform ultrasound-guided interventional procedure include secure vascular access vi ) courses/workshops ultrasound-guided procedural intervention . All participant receive standard learn form ) one hour didactic lecture deliver single investigator outline basic sonographic anatomy , ultrasound physic anatomy relevant perform ultrasound-guided axillary brachial plexus block . Within 24 hour complete learn phase , participant ask perform ultrasonography leave axilla volunteer . This follow either feedback A feedback B ( base random allocation ) . Feedback terminal , summative commence five minute participant complete task . Task description : 1 . Participant perform ultrasonography leave axilla adjacent upper limb prepare perform ultrasound-guided axillary brachial plexus block 2 . Participant identify four terminal branch brachial plexus ; identify screen use pointer provide ( freeze image use arrow screen ) name verbally . 3 . Participant identify adjacent structures/vessels relevant block indicate individually use pointer provide ( freeze image use arrow screen ) name verbally . 4 . Once participant obtain optimal ultrasound image , participant request indicate intend needle insertion point skin use pointer provide . Participants provide opportunity practice perform task 30 minute . Within one hour complete feedback session , participant ask attempt task . Performance feedback deliver video-recorded accord predefined protocol train investigator . Imaging obtained investigator use handheld camera . Concurrent ultrasound video image record use Digital Video Recorder ( DVR ) feature Ultrasonics Tablet ( Sonix Design Centre , B.K Ultrasound , Richmond , Canada ) . All video recording edit use video edit software ( Apple Movie , version 10.0.5 , Apple Computer Inc. USA ) present procedure together ultrasound output one screen Types Feedback : . Feedback A : Standard feedback ; consultant anesthetists ask give feedback would normally give performance task clinical situation . ii . Feedback B : Structured feedback ; train investigator give feedback accord set metric error previously develop validate . Trainees undergo deliberate practice volunteer demonstrate adequate objective performance assess set metric error provide . Video assessment scoring : Two train , independent blind assessor score video recording set metric error previously develop validate . The number step complete error commit compare ) Group define precede type feedback , ii ) Pre versus post feedback session</detailed_description>
