	<brief_summary>Primarily , investigator want test hypothesis possible detect epileptiform EEG cardiac surgery general anesthesia . Furthermore , investigator examine epileptic potential coincide , follow unrelated ischemic event detect EEG Near-infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) . Finally , investigator look independent association intraoperative seizure ( without ischemic event ) postoperative neurological outcome , well intraoperative seizure ( without ischemic event ) total amount TXA give .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Epileptic Potentials During Cardiac Surgery Association With Postoperative Neurological Outcome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator follow STROBE guideline perform prospective observational study . All patient demographic , co-morbidities surgical detail relevant calculate EuroSCORE record use institutional automatic anesthesia record system . Laboratory test perform accord clinical standard cardiac surgery . General anesthesia surgery perform accord attend physician 's preference . Invasive arterial blood pressure , central line transesophageal echocardiography ( TEE ) standard procedure . Before induction anesthesia two channel EEG instal forehead reference electrode FPZ , electrodes A1-F3 &amp; A2-F4 . A Narcotrend Compact M Monitor connect evaluate depth anesthesia continuously operation , also automatically store EEG data ( rate 128Hz ) screen epileptic activity or/and ischemic episode . This monitor standard practice cardiovascular division . Patients high risk intraoperative cerebral ischemic event ( stenosis carotid artery , deep hypothermic cardiac arrest , history stroke/prind/TIA , severe aortic atherosclerotic disease ) receive bilateral frontal brain oxygenation/perfusion monitor Near-infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) part standard practice institution . After administration anticoagulant heparin cardiopulmonary bypass , tranexamic acid give intravenously clinical standard accord BART trial . All intraoperative administration drug , blood transfusion hemodynamic management accord responsible cardiac anesthesiologist cardiac surgeon . Following surgery patient transport ICU deep sedation accord anesthesia team . As standard operation procedure responsible ICU attend resident evaluate cardiac surgery patient every hour intubate least twice per shift awake ( 4 time per day ) neurological deficit . A neurological deficit define patient develop new onset motor , sensory , cognitive dysfunction ( e.g. , hemiplegia , hemiparesis , aphasia , sensory deficit , impaired memory ) persist 24 hour due embolic , thrombotic , hemorrhagic vascular accident stroke . Special trained ICU nurse evaluate Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale ( RASS ) hourly basis . The time stop sedation reach RASS zero use determine ( delay ) time awaken . The appropriateness timing stop sedation treat ICU team . Standard practice , cardiac enzyme measure 6 hour first 48 hour , accord clinical judgement thereafter , least daily discharge ICU . New myocardial infarction define Troponin value &gt; 10x99th percentile URL first 48 h follow cardiac surgery , occur normal baseline Troponin value ( â‰¤99th percentile URL ) . In addition , either ( ) new pathological Q wave new LBBB , ( ii ) angiographically document new graft new native coronary artery occlusion , ( iii ) image evidence new loss viable myocardium new regional wall motion abnormality . Pulmonary respiratory complication note ( 1 ) pneumonia , ( 2 ) prolong intubation &gt; 24 hour , ( 3 ) re-intubation , ( 4 ) TRALI ARDS , well ( 5 ) tracheostomy due weaning failure . Renal complication define acute renal failure ( ARF ) require dialysis postoperative period . The indication dialysis include uremia , volume overload , biochemical abnormality base clinical judgment treat ICU team . The exact time ICU ventilator automatically record patient data management system ( PDMS ) record day ICU discharge and/or extubation . All postoperative diagnosis complication gather involved intensivist , cardiac surgeon , cardiologist , neurologist , radiologist consult specialist . Mortality evaluate hospital . The postoperative course include patient follow discharge hospital .</detailed_description>
