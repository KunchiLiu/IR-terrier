	<brief_summary>Despite fact small intestine make 75 % length digestive tract 90 % mucosal surface area , small bowel adenocarcinoma ( SBA ) rare . SBA equally dispatch along small bowel , predispose disease frequently associate . All data suggest particular carcinogenesis pathway . SBA carry poor prognosis stage standard treatment proved efficacy . So far , data available targeted therapy . From literature previous study group biologic data show SBA carcinogenesis closer colorectal gastric carcinogenesis . Nevertheless , difference arise ( ie : low Adenomatous Polyposis Coli mutation rate frequent DNA mismatch repair deficiency ) . Even trend found prognostic value molecular alteration phenotype variation accord small bowel segment , predispose disease could demonstrate due small sample size . BIONADEGE study plan biologic ancillary study NADEGE cohort enrol 366 patient SBA 2009 2012 France . The tumour block clinical data 187 patient collect . The main objective ass prognostic value recurrence free survival ( RFS ) non-metastatic patient overall survival ( OS ) metastatic patient molecular alteration set 46 gene abnormal protein expression potentially implicated carcinogenesis . The main secondary objective : 1 ) identify potential mutation targetable small intestine tumour protein expression , 2 ) state frequency molecular alteration accord tumour location , stage predispose disease establish clinico-biologic correlation . Tissue microarrays perform several potential prognostic marker assess . Sequencing tumour DNA investigate presence 740 hot spot somatic mutation 46 gene involved.The abnormal protein expression genetic alteration expect frequency superior 10 % assessed potential prognostic factor RFS OS . These evaluation large cohort could allow comparison pathway offer good knowledge tumour molecular phenotype prognosis give rational target therapy trials The predisposing diseases SBA involve several different carcinogenesis pathway . Finally , molecular classification SBA attempt .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The NADEGE cohort involve 75 centre enrol 365 patient . Among 232 patient resection primary tumour 58 centre . This large series world SBA biological study . The patient enrol NADEGE cohort aware biologic study authorisation perform already collect . Baseline clinical data patient enrol NADEGE cohort already available present poster discussion session European Society Medical Oncology congress 2013 . In cohort primary location duodenum 51 % patient , predispose disease report 18.8 % patient mainly Crohn disease 8 % Lynch syndrome 6 % patient . The follow-up ongoing . The analysis 3-years recurrence-free survival plan 2015 analysis 5-years overall survival 2017 . Today 187 tumour sample collect archived pathology department Saint Antoine hospital ( Paris ) . Among 187 tumour tumour stage : stage 0 : 4 , stage I : 10 , stage II : 34 , stage III : 63 , undetermined stage non-metastatic : 30 ( thus 141 non-metastatic tumour ) stage IV : 48 , primary : duodenum : 128 , jejunum : 31 , ileon : 27 , undetermined : 3 . The chemotherapy perform FOLFOX 80 % case . Work Package 1 : Database ( team 1 ) The clinical data NADEGE cohort collect e-crf . The initial descriptive data already monitor GERCOR team . The result already present . BIONADEGE plan ancillary study NADEGE cohort . The complementary query purpose BIONADEGE address team 1 NADEGE investigator . The follow-up data progression ( metastatic patient ) , recurrence ( non-metastatic patient ) death ( patient ) obtain every 6 month . Follow-up data collect 2019 order obtain 5-years follow-up patient . Work Package 2 : Anatomopathology ( team 2 ) All tumour sample already bank pathology laboratory Saint Antoine hospital . Slides representative tumour area select send Paris Descartes university allow DNA extraction . Tissue microarrays ( TMA ) immunohistochemistry validation study perform . Several potential prognostic marker assess MismatchRepair ( MMR ) protein , P53 , beta-catenin , c-myc protein . Other predictive marker chemotherapy hENT1 , O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase ( MGMT ) target therapy Proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase ( ROS1 ) , hepatocyte growth factor receptor c-Met ( HGFR ) , Alk , Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor-2 ( HER-2 ) Programmed cell death 1 ( PD-1 ) also assess . The case overexpressing HER-2 HGFR protein immunohistochemistry test Fluorescent In Situ Hybridisation ( FISH ) . Work Package 3 : Biochemistry ( team 3 ) DNA extract tumour block university unit S1147 accord follow protocol . Using 1.0-mm punch , paraffin embed tissue case sample representative area contain 50 % tumour cell . DNA thereafter extract sample follow manufacturer 's recommendation . The team3 use competitive allele specific taqman probe design Kras wild type allele ( Hs.00000174-rf - Life Technologies ) serial dilution DNA sample order quantify amplifiable DNA . Only sample 10 ng amplifiable DNA retain sequence . DNA sample amplify . The presence 740 hot spot somatic mutation 46 gene investigate . Data analysis , include alignment hg19 human reference genome variant call , do use Software Life Technologies . Alignments visually verify annotate software Integrative Biosoftware . A sequence variation consider potential mutation ( ) coverage superior 200Ã— , ( ii ) allelic frequency superior 10 % , ( iii ) strand bias 0.2 0.8 , ( iv ) variation report 1000 genome database , ( v ) variation missense non-sense variation . All select variation control use Sanger sequence technics use amplified fragment le 150 bp centre potential mutation .</detailed_description>
