	<brief_title>Effect Positive End-expiratory Pressure Optimal Balloon Volume During Esophageal Pressure Monitoring</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The esophageal pressure ( Pes ) use surrogate pleural pressure obtain transpulmonary pressure . Catheter air balloon commonly use method measure Pes . The optimal injected volume balloon key factor accurate measurement Pes . The recoil pressure balloon turn balloon over-filled , result over-estimation PES ; hand , under-filled balloon also properly transmit surround pressure balloon . However , researcher show optimal balloon volume relate surround pressure even correspond manufacturer 's recommendation . Theoretically , balloon transmural pressure ( PTM ) zero , represent balloon condition equivalent pressure inside outside balloon , define optimal volume . However , clinical setting , difficult determine balloon PTM , therefore optimal volume obtain , surround pressure balloon conveniently measure . In present study , investigator develop simple method obtain optimal balloon volume observe effect positive end-expiratory pressure optimal balloon volume esophageal pressure monitoring . The investigator want validate accuracy method bench study clinical feasibility mechanical ventilate patient .</detailed_description>
