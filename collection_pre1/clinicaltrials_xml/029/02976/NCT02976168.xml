	<brief_summary>The aim study understand relationship intracranial pressure regulation , cerebral tissue oxygenation cognitive functioning . More specifically , study test hypothesis head tilt increase intracranial pressure ( measure study , demonstrate previous study ) , induce venous congestion facial swelling , decrease intracranial tissue oxygenation hamper brain functioning . The objective study therefore assess young healthy people head-down tilt ( HDT ) , assess cognitive brain functioning , cerebral tissue oxygenation ( non-invasively ) , frontal skin thickness , cerebral perfusion neuronal functioning via event-related potential .</brief_summary>
