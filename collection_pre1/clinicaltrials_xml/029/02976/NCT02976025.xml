	<brief_title>Remote Supervision Implementing Collaborative Care Perinatal Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Depression common serious disorder among pregnant woman low income group receive effective treatment . The highly evidence base collaborative care ( CC ) model depression show work woman pregnancy widely implement population . The propose study target improve dissemination evidence base CC treatment model pregnant postpartum woman depression , common disorder perinatal period ( pregnancy first year follow birth ) . Longitudinal remote consultation ( LRC ) implementation strategy show improve fidelity evidence-based practice patient outcome mental health innovation . We believe LRC use equal benefit complex intervention CC . The purpose study compare two implementation strategy Collaborative Care depression treatment : 1 ) standard implementation 2 ) standard implementation + Longitudinal Remote Consultation ( LRC ) . This research do order ass implementation patient outcomes sit receive standard implementation approach without LRC . The result propose study provide information benefit relative value ongoing consultation , LRC , implementation complex intervention like collaborative care . The propose study involve twenty federally qualify health center ( FQHCs ) provide prenatal care part national OCHIN Network . All site receive standard implementation approach . After pre-implementation training ten sit randomly select receive LRC . Implementation clinical outcome well cost compare study condition 12 month implementation period 13-21 month sustainment period . The result propose study provide critical generalizable knowledge regard benefit ongoing consultation implementation complex intervention like collaborative care .</detailed_description>
