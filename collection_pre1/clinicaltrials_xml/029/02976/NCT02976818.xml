	<brief_summary>Aortic valve stenosis ( AVS ) , common form valve disease western world , afflict 1 million individual North America [ 1 ] burden AVS high expect double within next 50 year [ 2 ] . Medical therapy prevent development reduce progression AVS currently available effective treatment AVS aortic valve replacement , cost estimate 120,000 $ [ 3,4 ] . Recently , others identify rs10455872 LPA locus susceptibility single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) aortic valve calcification ( AVC ) AVS [ 5,6 ] rs10455872 associate elevate plasma lipoprotein ( Lp ) ( ) level [ 7 ] . Lp ( ) LDL-like particle consist hepatically synthesize apolipoprotein B-100 noncovalently bound plasminogen-like glycoprotein apolipoprotein ( ) [ 8 ] . Lp ( ) promote atherosclerotic stenosis , possibly thrombosis , hypothesize contribute wound healing , could explain association AVS [ 9,10 ] . Lp ( ) relatively refractory lifestyle drug intervention , nicotinic acid monoclonal antibody inhibition proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 show reduction Lp ( ) level [ 11,12 ] . However , evidence patient AVS could characterize high Lp ( ) level scarce . Glader et al . [ 13 ] show plasma level Lp ( ) almost 1.5-fold high 101 patient AVS compare match control , although relationship reach statistical significance . Subsequent study also report association elevate plasma Lp ( ) level high prevalence AVS . More specifically , Kamstrup colleague [ 14 ] report elevated Lp ( ) level correspond genotype associate increase risk AVS general population level &gt; 90 mg/dL predict threefold increase risk . We measure Lp ( ) oxidize phospholipid plasma level 220 patient mild-to-moderate calcific AVS enrol Aortic Stenosis Progression Observation : Measuring Effects Rosuvastatin ( ASTRONOMER ) trial [ 15 ] . Results study suggest high Lp ( ) oxidize phospholipid predict calcific AVS progression , especially young patient calcific AVS . We also find statin therapy considerably increase Lp ( ) oxidize phospholipid level . Whether fact statins increase risk factor calcific AVS might explain least certain extent statin fail promote calcific AVS regression stabilization least four trial , include ASTRONOMER . Familial hypercholesterolemia ( FH ) autosomal codominant single-gene disorder cause mutation LDL receptor gene disrupt normal clearance LDL . Phenotypic feature characteristic disease 's heterozygous form 2- 3-fold raise plasma LDL-cholesterol concentration , tendinous xanthomatosis premature atherosclerotic coronary artery disease . High Lp ( ) level show explain residual cardiovascular disease risk FH [ 16,17 ] . Recent study demonstrate FH heterozygote elevate AVC compare non-FH subject [ 18 ] Lp ( ) level positively correlate AVC asymptomatic FH heterozygotes [ 19 ] . Vongpromek et al . [ 19 ] demonstrate plasma Lp ( ) concentration independent risk factor AVC cohort 129 asymptomatic heterozygous FH patient age 40 69 year . In study , AVC significantly associate plasma Lp ( ) level , age , body mass index , blood pressure , duration statin use , cholesterol-year score coronary artery calcification ( CAC ) score .</brief_summary>
