	<detailed_description>Plaque psoriasis vulgaris chronic inflammatory skin disorder . There 2 key abnormality psoriasis , hyper proliferation keratinocytes inflammatory cell infiltrate , include ; dendritic cell ( DCs ) , macrophage , natural killer ( NK ) T cell , mast cell , T cell neutrophils . There strong evidence T cell important role psoriasis , include fact T-cell target agent effective psoriasis therapy . This study first time AZD0284 give human . The current Phase 1 study investigates safety , tolerability , food effect , pharmacokinetic ( PK ) pharmacodynamic ( PD ) property single repeat dos AZD0284 . The study conduct healthy subject avoid interference disease process drug . The study divide 2 part : Part 1 ( SAD ) Part 2 ( MAD ) , Part 1 split 2 sub-parts : 1A ( fast ) 1B ( feed ) . The secondary safety pharmacology AZD0284 investigate use vitro vivo model . Screening AZD0284 diverse set vitro radiolig binding , enzyme , functional electrophysiological assay include cardiac ion channel identify off-target activity likely relevant near therapeutic exposure range . The inclusion exclusion criterion define select subject free significant illness include study . The select starting dose SAD part ( Part 1A ) study 4.0 mg AZD0284 ( oral solution ) . The maximum allow exposure base toxicology study 127 μmol*h/L ( total AUC ( 0-24 , s ) ) 7.35 μmol/L ( total Cmax ) . In Part 1A ( SAD study ) , 6 dose level Part 2 ( MAD study ) , 3 dose level plan . In either part , 2 additional dos may add need . The result study form basis decision future study . The study help identify appropriate , well-tolerated dos administer subsequent study patient psoriasis .</detailed_description>
