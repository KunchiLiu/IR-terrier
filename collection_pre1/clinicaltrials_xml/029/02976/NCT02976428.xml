	<brief_summary>To ensure successful outcome total knee replacement ( TKR ) soft tissue balance proper implant position important surgical procedure . Soft tissue structure knee include ligament , muscle , tendon , meniscus stabilize cushion knee joint . Lack proper soft tissue balance imprecise implant positioning may result knee stiffness , pain , instability limit range motion ( ROM ) . This may result implant failure need revision surgery . As part standard practice orthopedic surgeon use manual knee balancer device help guide soft tissue balance achieve optimal knee balance . New sensor-assisted technology provide surgeon measurable information help achieve soft tissue balancing , provide surgeon immediate visual feedback surgery . This feedback , transmit wirelessly sensor , give surgeon electronic information soft tissue balance implant position.The purpose study determine sensor guide soft tissue balance device ( Verasense ) effective balance knee surgery compare standard soft tissue balance perform manual balancer device .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Conventional vs. Sensor Guided Soft Tissue Balancing TKA RCT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study prospective double-blind randomize controlled trial patient present elective primary TKR compare outcomes TKR use conventional soft tissue balance tensiometer device versus augment soft tissue balance OrthoSensor VerasenseTM sensor device . The primary outcome rate unbalance TKRs base quantitative Verasense definition well balance knee define mediolateral intercompartmental loading difference â‰¤15 pound ROM . Secondary outcome include difference clinical outcome score patient satisfaction among sensor guide case control . Patients randomize receive TKR Triathlon total knee system ( Stryker ) case control group accord : ( 1 ) control group standard balance technique use sensor data obtain blinded fashion use balance TKR implant , ( 2 ) experimental case group sensor guide balance sensor data use balance TKR within defined parameter .</detailed_description>
