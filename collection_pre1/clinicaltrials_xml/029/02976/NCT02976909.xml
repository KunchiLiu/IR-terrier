	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety TPFinduction Chemotherapy Boundary Resectable Local Advanced Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Esophageal cancer one common malignant tumor China . In Asian country , esophageal squamous carcinoma main pathological type esophageal carcinoma . Prognosis esophageal squamous carcinoma usually poor surgery radical treatment . However , optimal therapy pattern local advance esophageal carcinoma still unclear . Part patient clinical stag T4 present multiple lymph node metastasis esophageal carcinoma large diameter initially diagnose boundary resectable , mean patient may able undergo R0 resection . However , patient diagnose boundary resectable esophageal carcinoma , still sufficient study implicate improve R0 resection rate neoadjuvant chemotherapy . DDP combination 5-FU docetaxel regimen ( DCF ) report effective neoadjuvant chemotherapy treat esophageal squamous carcinoma . However , study also show DCF regimen cause severe adverse reaction . The mechanism paclitaxel similar docetaxel less adverse event docetaxel . Based research situation mention , investigator decide conduct phase II clinical trial explore efficacy safety paclitaxel combination DDP 5-FU ( TPF ) regimen treat locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma .</detailed_description>
