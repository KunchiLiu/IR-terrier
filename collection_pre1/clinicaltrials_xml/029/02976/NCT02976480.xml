	<brief_title>The Irrigation Or No Irrigation In Simple Lacerations Trials</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Current guideline recommend laceration irrigate prior closure . However , little data literature suggest simple laceration irrigation diminishes subsequent rate infection . Do patient benefit practice involve additional time cost ? Hypothesis Testing &amp; Procedure : The purpose double-blind randomize control non-inferiority study test hypothesis non-irrigation laceration increase rate post-repair infection . Every adult patient present Chicoutimi 's Hospital Emergency Department simple laceration identify triage nurse . Eligibility subsequently assess emergency room physician accord inclusion exclusion criterion . Eligible consent patient randomize either irrigation non-irrigation arm . Post-repair rate infection aesthetic appearance satisfaction report . Sample Size Determination : With fairly liberal inclusion criterion , 6 % wound infection rate irrigation group expect , correspond upper limit 2 6 % range report literature . Non-inferiority non-irrigation would accept rate infection group exceed 4 % usual infection rate 6 % irrigation , previously state . As , study power 80 % 95 % one-sided confidence interval , population 874 patient would need conclude non-irrigation non-inferior infection rate exceed 4 % infection rate irrigation group . In addition , account attrition rate approximately 10 % , enrolment 1000 patient aim . Statistical Analysis : Statistical analysis do certified statistician . According distribution data , Chi2 Fisher test use . A preliminary analysis data do Spring 2017 ass safety intervention . Plan Missing Data : Patients lose follow consider infection record subsequent visit wound infection find consultation regional Electronic Medical Record .</detailed_description>
