	<detailed_description>Purpose study The purpose study characterise salivary faecal microbiome patient recurrent aphthous stomatitis ( RAS ) compare finding match healthy control group . Another purpose investigate effect treatment probiotic microbiome whole saliva faeces well severity number RAS outbreaks . Moreover , smear take present aphthous ulcer treatment probiotic order characterise local microbiota . It assume microbiome whole saliva faeces patient RAS ( minor major type aphthous ulcer ) differs microbiome whole saliva faeces age- gender-matched control person . It also hypothesise probiotic treatment beneficial effect mucosal pain reduces severity RAS frequency outbreak . Furthermore , assume treatment probiotic effect microbiome whole saliva faeces patient RAS . Background Recurrent aphthous stomatitis ( RAS ) one common ulcerative disease affect oral mucosa . The prevalence vary 5-25 % . The aetiology remain unknown , several local , systemic , immunologic , genetic , allergic , nutritional , microbial factor propose causative agent . Clinically , RAS characterise recurrent bout one several round , shallow , painful oral ulcer interval month day . RAS classify three different type : minor , major herpetiform . Minor RAS comprise 80 % case . This type characterise aphthous ulcer diameter 5 mm , often localised buccal labial mucosa . The ulcer heal within 7-10 day without formation scar . Major RAS appear 10-15 % patient . The ulcer often crateriform diameter 10-30 mm , typically present labial mucosa , soft palate , tonsillar region oropharynx . The healing time may vary 2 6 week leave cicatrix . These ulcer painful food intake may compromise . The prevalence herpetiform type 5-10 % . This type often localised floor mouth ventral part tongue , characterise aggregation multiple small ulcer . The aetiology remain unknown , number local systemic factor assume increase predisposition , include mucosal trauma , stressful event , hormonal change , smoke cessation , allergy various food substance well vitamin- and/or mineral deficiency . The also genetic predisposition possibility develop RAS 90 % parent RAS 20 % one parent RAS . Microbial factor A number microorganism suggest involved aetiopathogenesis RAS . These include oral streptococci , especially Streptococcus mitis , cross-reaction oral streptococci oral mucosal antigens unspecific consider clinically insignificant . Helicobacter pylorus , associate gastritis duodenal ulcer may also see dental plaque therefore also suggest involved pathogenesis RAS , anti-H. pylorus seropositivity find increase patient RAS . Various vira find biopsy aphthous ulcer cytomegalovirus Epstein-Barr virus . Herpes simplex , varicella zoster adenovirus also assume play role aetiopathogenesis . However , possible show causal relationship virus infection RAS , viral DNA may present due secondary infection . Novel technology improve ability make depth analysis microbiota patient RAS . While work study protocol one study microbiome patient RAS publish show increased proportion Bacteroides species oral mucosa patient RAS compare healthy control . Thus , previous study also suggest oral microbiota appear play role development RAS well perpetuation RAS . In study characterise microbiome whole saliva , faeces aphthous ulcer patient RAS ( active lesion ) analyse differs microbiome healthy subject . This characterisation could essential understanding pathogenesis RAS contribute development novel strategy manage patient . Immunopathological factor Several study indicate pathogenesis RAS include number cell-mediated mechanism , exact immunopathogenesis still clarify . Phagocytic cytotoxic T-lymphocytes may role destruction oral epithelium presence immune cell regulate maintain local release cytokine . Patients outbreak RAS increase presence gamma-delta T-cells blood compare healthy control person patient without active RAS . Moreover , patient RAS increase presence Tumour Necrosis Factor ( TNF ) -alpha compare RAS , also proinflammatory cytokine like interleukin-2 -6 likely play role pathogenesis RAS . Finally , aphthous-like ulcer find associated number inflammatory bowel disease ulcerative colitis Crohn 's disease celiac disease well cyclic neutropenia , HIV-infection immunoglobulin A ( IgA ) -deficiency . Accordingly , immune component may involve RAS contribute change intestinal microbiota vice versa . In study , characterise microbiota saliva faeces patient RAS , treatment probiotic . The study design methods The project comprise cross-sectional study investigate microbiome whole saliva faeces 20 patient RAS 20 healthy control person . The project also include double-blind randomized placebo-controlled intervention probiotic ( Lactobacillus reuteri-containing lozenge 2 tablet daily 3 month ) placebo . The salivary faecal microbiome RAS patient compare treatment . The patient RAS recruit among patient refer Oral Medicine Clinic , Faculty Health Medical Sciences , University Copenhagen . The 20 healthy control recruit via www.forsoegsperson.dk Methods include : - Interview . onset RAS , oral symptom ( assessed mean visual analogue scale ) , comorbidity , medication intake , smoke alcohol habit , oral hygiene habit . - Collection chew paraffin-stimulated whole saliva . - Oral examination include evaluation aphthous ulcer ( Ulcer Severity Score ) , registration dental status periodontal status . - A smear one aphthous ulcer . - A faecal sample collect subject home thorough instruction handle accord manual Statens Serum Institut . From sample 250 mg collect keep freezer kept -80Â°C processing analysis . - A blood test include haemoglobin ( HgB ) , C reactive protein ( CRP ) , iron , cobalamin , folate , transferrin , ferritin vitamin D level . Extraction bacterial DNA saliva , faecal smear sample ( baseline , 7-day 90-day intervention probiotic placebo , respectively ) carry laboratory Department Odontology , University Copenhagen , use previously establish procedure base instruction Human Microbiome Project . Metagenomic analyse extract bacterial DNA saliva , smear faecal sample make Beijing Genomics Institute . Illumina 16S rDNA sequence allows determination bacterial taxonomy phylogenetic diversity .</detailed_description>
