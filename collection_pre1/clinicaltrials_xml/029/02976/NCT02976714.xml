	<detailed_description>Cystic Fibrosis ( CF ) autosomal recessive disease result mutation CFTR gene . CFTR encode chloride channel , mainly express apical membrane epithelial cell . CFTR dysfunction induces mucus thicken , cause multiple disorder respiratory , digestive reproductive tract . In CF patient , lung disease main cause morbidity mortality , severity variable among CF patient , even among genotype . This clinical variability depend two factor : genetic ( complex allele CFTR gene modifier gene ) environmental factor . Genetic factor largely explore , several modifier gene identify . By contrast , environmental factor still poorly know . It well establish environmental factor modify phenotype act epigenetic mark ( i.e . DNA methylation , histone modification ) present genome . Epigenetic modification regulate modulate gene expression . In previous profiled DNA methylation genome-wide nasal epithelial cell sample 32 CF patient 24 healthy control . CF patient homozygous p.Phe508del mutation &gt; 18-years-old stratified accord lung disease severity . Through study , identify 187 genomic region ( CpG dinucleotides ) differentially methylated CF patient mild lung disease CF patient severe lung disease . The present project aim identify predictive epigenetic biomarkers lung disease severity , among 187 region . While previous study carry genomic DNA extract nasal epithelial cell , present project use non-invasive model : spontaneous sputum . Hypothesis : differentially methylated genomic region mild severe CF patient use predictive epigenetic biomarkers lung disease severity cystic fibrosis . Objectives : ( ) identify predictive epigenetic biomarkers lung disease severity among differentially methylated genomic region mild severe CF patient , ( ii ) characterize non-invasive cellular model , spontaneous sputum , analysis epigenetic biomarkers lung disease severity CF , ( iii ) analyze variation DNA methylation patient time ( time inclusion , 6 month , 12 month 18 month )</detailed_description>
