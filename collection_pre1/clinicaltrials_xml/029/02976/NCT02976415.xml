	<brief_title>In-Bed Cycling ICU Patients Post Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Advances medical science technology lead effective management critically-ill patient subsequent improvement ICU survival rate . Patients survive ICU stay often leave post-ICU impairment include muscle weakness functional limitation . Cardiac surgeries commonly perform worldwide majority patient require post-operative ICU care . In past decade , patient qualify cardiac surgery tend old , great number co-morbidities likely require prolong ICU stay . The effectiveness physiotherapy various rehabilitation modality patient pre- post cardiac surgery investigate . However , date study specifically address feasibility safety in-bed cycling patient undergoing cardiac surgery require prolong critical care . Principle Research Question : Is in-bed cycle safe feasible intervention patient post cardiac surgery require prolong stay critical care ? Methods : Adult patient post-cardiac surgery admit cardiac surgery ICU remain intubated ventilate least 72 hour eligible enrollment . Participants receive 20 minute in-bed cycling plus routine physiotherapy perform critical care physiotherapist . Patients enrol 28 day able ambulate . Primary Outcomes : Safety bedside cycle evaluate monitoring number adverse event occur cycle session . Feasibility implement in-bed cycling daily physiotherapy practice evaluate determine cycling session conduct least eighty percent time cycle appropriate . Relevance : Before conduct large randomize control trial investigate effectiveness in-bed cycling critically-ill cardiac surgery population , safety intervention need determine . This first study program research evaluate bedside cycle cardiac surgical ICU .</detailed_description>
