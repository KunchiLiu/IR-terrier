	<detailed_description>Noninvasive monitoring liver fibrosis unmet critical need within clinical management child chronic liver disease . While liver biopsy often use initial diagnostic evaluation child liver disease , subsequent surveillance liver biopsy rarely perform child inherent invasiveness risk . Therefore , understand natural history fibrosis progression child limit . The patchy nature fibrosis many important pediatric liver disease [ e.g . biliary atresia ( BA ) cystic fibrosis liver disease ( CFLD ) ] limit utility sequential liver biopsy even employ clinical practice pediatrics . Thus , non-invasive mean assess liver fibrosis throughout liver would highly desirable clinically useful pediatric hepatology . ChiLDReN poise uniquely qualified conduct comprehensive longitudinal assessment utility FibroScan™-specific elastography , liver stiffness measurement ( LSM ) measure hepatic fibrosis child serious chronic cholestatic liver disease .</detailed_description>
