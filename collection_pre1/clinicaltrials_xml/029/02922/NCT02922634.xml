	<brief_summary>The objective study determine whether identify patient baseline cognitive deficit preoperative cognitive screening may aid patient , family , surgeon decision-making ; inform potentially improve anesthetic management improve patient safety identify risk postoperative morbidity . Aim 1 . Assess marginal benefit structure preoperative cognitive screen relative standard systematic preoperative evaluation identifying senior likely cognitive impairment . Aim 2 . Determine whether preoperative cognitive impairment predicts postoperative outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Preoperative Cognitive Screening Older Thoracic Spinal Surgical Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project design prospective , single-center observational study . The cohort consist 500 consent subject ≥ 65 year age present Brigham Women 's Hospital Weiner Center Preoperative Evaluation ( CPE ) prior elective thoracic surgery ( specifically , thoracoscopic lung resection , lobectomy , thoracotomy , esophagectomy ) neurological posterior thoracolumbar spine surgery neurosurgeon Dr. Groff , Dr. Lu Dr. Chi . 250 subject undergoing thoracic surgery recruit 250 subject undergoing neurological posterior thoracolumbar spine surgery recruit ( 500 total ) . These age choose significant clinical data demonstrate increase cognitive impairment community dwell elder . Eligibility criterion include : patient ≥ 65 year age American Society Anesthesiologists ( ASA ) physical status classification I-III presenting elective thoracic surgery spinal surgery . Exclusion criterion include plan Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) admission postoperatively , history stroke brain tumor , uncorrected vision hearing impairment ( unable see picture read hear instruction ) ; limit use dominant hand ( limited ability draw ) ; inability speak , read , understand English . Patients introduce study flyer provide surgeon 's office . A study team member speak favorably predispose participate determine satisfy eligibility criterion . After obtain consent , study staff gain information patient 's age year education . Study staff administer standard instrument assess social support ( MOS Social Support Survey , 12-item self-report questionnaire ) thoracic surgical patient . The Modified Brief Pain Inventory Short-Form ( mBPI-sf ) administer spinal surgical patient . Health functional status activity daily live ( ADLs ) instrumental activity daily live ( IADLs ) , respectively , World Health Organization Disability Assessment Scale [ WHODAS ] ) administer surgical patients.The World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 alternative 36-Item Rand Health Survey Short-Form ( SF36 ) measure physical health disability . In addition , patient ask 've fall within last 6 month , whether 've evaluate change memory thinking , accompany appointment , employment status live situation ( alone , institutionalized , live family member ) patient survey . The study staff administer MiniCog , simple cognitive screen tool take 2-4 min complete little education , language , race bias . In addition , Animal Fluency test administer , short cognitive screen take one minute complete . Other measure cognitive impairment obtain study staff : documentation patient 's standard preoperative form , patient informant report diagnosis evaluation cognitive impairment memory concern , systematic medical record review . Each enrol patient receive business card listing investigator ' contact information advise expect follow telephone 6 12 month surgery verify data element reassess functional outcome . Delirium assess prospectively per day postoperative day 1 , 2 , 3 train study team member use Confusion Assessment Method [ CAM ] . For patient Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) postoperatively , Confusion Assessment Method ICU ( CAM-ICU ) administer prospectively twice per day postoperative day 1 , 2 , 3 train study team member ( Attachment-CAM-ICU ) . Delirium common postoperative day 1-3 CAM well-validated measure delirium surgical patient . For functional status , WHODAS administer 6-12 month postoperatively either personnel surgeon 's office part routine follow study staff telephone . We also collect information secondary outcome include presence advance directive , whether surgical procedure , time postoperative anesthesia care unit ( PACU ) discharge , discharge place home ( rehabilitation , skilled nursing facility ) , hospital length stay ( LOS ) , hospital complication , anesthetic dosage ( include bispectral index ( BIS ) information ) , estimate blood loss , blood pressure , oxygen saturation , 30-day reoperation readmission rate , 30-day 1-year mortality . These outcome record medical record , BWH Balanced Scorecard , electronic database hospitalize patient tabulate 31 element hospital event , Brigham Women 's Hospital BWH Research Patient Database Enhanced Query . Data also confirm follow telephone interview .</detailed_description>
