	<detailed_description>Confocal laser endomicroscopy ( CLE ) develop overcome limitation current endoscopic sample technique . CLE allow detailed examination cellular structure since provide image similar image pathologist see microscope . At present , probe base CLE ( pCLE ) available technology endomicroscopy . Before optical biopsy , fluorescein give intravenously fluorescent light come horizontal special focal plane detect pCLE digestive system . CLE provide real-time histopathological diagnosis lead immediate endoscopic treatment case early esophageal gastric neoplasia . Patients treatment Barrett 's esophagus relate esophageal neoplasia ( dysplasia early cancer ) surveilled endoscopically biopsy rule relapse Barrett 's esophagus neoplasia . Project A - pCLE detection esophageal gastric lesion : We plan investigate diagnostic accuracy pCLE ( compare standard histopathology ) patient endoscopically diagnose early esophageal gastric lesion . Project B - pCLE detection persistent/recurrent intestinal metaplasia/dysplasia patient endoscopic treatment BORN : Investigators plan perform prospective cross-over study compare diagnostic accuracy sensitivity pCLE standard biopsy patient complete endoscopic treatment BORN . Surveillance endoscopy focus detection persistent/recurrent IM dysplasia ( ev . neoplasia ) . BORN define low-grade dysplasia ( confirm specialize esophageal pathologist ) high grade dysplasia early adenocarcinoma . Investigators also examine ability pCLE detect bury gland radiofrequency ablation . Methods : Project A : Patients refer department suspect endoscopically visible lesion esophagus stomach undergo pCLE standard upper GI endoscopy pCLE . After real-time diagnosis ( make endoscopist ) , standard tissue sampling ( biopsy , endoscopic resection dissection ) follow standard histopathological tissue assessment follow . Project B : During one surveillance endoscopies patient finish endoscopic treatment BORN ( interval depend baseline diagnosis ) , pCLE perform cardia , neo-Z-line , esophagus body visible lesion , image store . Thereafter , standard biopsy take sent histopathological analysis . For optical biopsy , endoscopist ( real time ) two expert pathologist independently blindly evaluate `` optical specimen '' . The standard biopsy specimen assess independently pathologist assess optical biopsy . Results optical biopsy compare result standard biopsy . Main hypothesis : Project A : pCLE inferior standard biopsy ( resection ) specimen histopathological diagnose esophageal/gastric lesion . Project B : pCLE inferior compare standard biopsy detect persistent/recurrent IM , recurrent neoplasia bury gland .</detailed_description>
