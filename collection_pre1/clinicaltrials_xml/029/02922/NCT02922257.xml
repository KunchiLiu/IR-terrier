	<detailed_description>This study investigate potential FK506 binding protein 5 ( FKBP5 ) ( gene expression marker , example pentraxin 3 [ PTX-3 ] , serum/glucocorticoid regulate kinase 1 [ SGK1 ] , glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta [ GSK3b ] ) develop biomarker use diagnosis Cushing 's syndrome , assessment effectiveness medical surgical treatment , detection relapse endogenous Cushing 's syndrome surgery . The primary study hypothesis FKBP5 level elevate patient Cushing 's syndrome , level decrease successful surgical treatment . This non-randomized specimen collection study pre- post-surgery follow-up period . This study perform patient adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH ) -dependent Cushing 's syndrome schedule curative surgery follow relapse endogenous Cushing 's syndrome 3 year post-surgery . No study medication give .</detailed_description>
