	<detailed_description>Health literacy critically important skill help people become active participant health care . The 2003 National Assessment Adult Literacy show 75 million Americans basic health literacy skill , indicate many 1 4 Americans difficulty understand information healthcare . Persons racial ethnic minority likely even low level health literacy . Twenty-four percent black ( 9.5 million person ) 41 % Hispanics ( 21 million person ) basic level health literacy . These person low level health literacy compel evidence , include finding ( see ) , link race ethnicity disparities health via health literacy . Members minority group older adult frequently affect chronic disease cancer , high blood pressure , heart attack , stroke , diabetes , elevate cholesterol , asthma , hepatitis C , HIV infection , mental health disorder many others . The twin burden chronic disease low level health literacy thus fall disproportionately need - member minority old adult , likely experience one chronic condition often health literacy skill help cope . Chronic disease self-management ( CDSM ) logical target general health literacy intervention . In approach cut across specific disease . CDSM target problem skill need cope issue fatigue , pain , stress , depression , sleep disturbance treatment adherence . Studies show in-person CDSM class improve patient ' function reduce healthcare utilization , availability limit due lack qualify personnel cost . Similarly , intervention develop improve health literacy , difficult scale level need meet challenge low health literacy ( 40 million person ) due cost . Effective intervention potential wide dissemination reasonable cost urgently need . In previous study , investigator show computer-delivered tailored information intervention target health literacy deploy either information kiosk clinical office Internet could cost-effective improve patient ' health literacy adherence . It clear , however , whether sort computer-delivered , multimedia interactive approach effective improve CDSM skill person low baseline level health literacy , , whether effect extend beyond health literacy general health , self-efficacy , activation , treatment adherence . In follow-up study investigator evaluate possibility create personally relevant computer-delivered intervention target CDSM health literacy among African-Americans , Hispanics , white non-Hispanics :</detailed_description>
