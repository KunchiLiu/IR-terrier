	<brief_title>Social Cognition Assessment Young Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This purpose study create comprehensive social cognitive battery virtual reality therapy useful determine treat social deficit young adult . With development , young adult social cognition impairment may provide way thoroughly evaluate treat deficit . Participants screen eligibility research staff . Individuals meet enrollment criterion provide write consent enter study . Once write consent obtain , participant enter assessment phase study , follow treatment phase . Both neuropsychological social-cognitive test functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) measure administer prior follow treatment phase study . The treatment phase entail use virtual-reality platform train practice social interaction skill . Participants reimburse pre- post- assessment portion . No compensation provide complete training . The first scheduled assessment visit assess efficacy feasibility battery standardize measure well measure develop specifically use population , assess mainly social skill face processing . The pre-training neuropsychological assessment visit estimate take 4 hour complete , however take long due individual 's processing style social-cognitive ability . Participants schedule appointment conduct neuropsychological test give option complete fMRI assessment . The pre-training fMRI assessment visit estimate take 1 1.5 hour complete . Once participant complete pre-training assessment , enter treatment phase study participate Virtual Reality Social Cognition Training . Participants see 1-2 time week six week . Session length may range time 1 hour 2 hour week . Each visit consist participant clinician engage semi-structured live conversation virtual-reality platform . Both participant clinician talk interact within virtual environment digital character , avatar . Each conversation set-up , initiate , conduct coach and/or confederate clinician train administer treatment . The confederate clinician able change his/her likeness voice ( voice modulation software ) play role conversation partner participant . Live feedback coaching provide coach clinician build social reason think skill . Each session center around specific social objective ( e.g. , initiate conversation , conduct job interview , confront friend , go blind date ) allow practice specific social strategy . Social strategy present hierarchical manner , increase complexity throughout training , strengthen awareness application social reason think skill . Strategies practice include : 1 ) recognizing 's social intention , 2 ) social response , 3 ) self-assertion social problem solve . Following completion treatment phase , participant complete post-assessment measure include neuropsychological social cognitive assessment fMRI image assessment . The post-neuropsychological assessment visit estimate take 3 hour complete post- fMRI visit estimate take 1 1.5 hour complete .</detailed_description>
