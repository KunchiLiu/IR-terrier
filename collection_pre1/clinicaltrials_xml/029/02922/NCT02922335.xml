Assessments complete month 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 12 , 16 , confirmation outcome data use collateral report system record . The first aim evaluate effect time MST-EA improve ultimate outcome treatment : reduce serious antisocial behavior . The second aim evaluate effect MST-EA ( ) key proximal target treatment ( self-regulation ) ( b ) propose intermediate outcome treatment ( gainful activity , substance use , MI problem ) . The final aim determine whether MST-EA 's effect ultimate outcome result effect proximal target intermediate outcome treatment . There current absence antisocial behavior treatment demonstrate efficacy age group . The ultimate effect propose research would decrease antisocial behavior public health-related behavior ( MI symptom , substance use , homelessness , unemployment ) among one highest-risk population individual MI .
