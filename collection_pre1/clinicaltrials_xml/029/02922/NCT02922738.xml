	<brief_summary>Health care provider use variety computerized medical information source reduce knowledge gap support patient care decision . Few study evaluate impact medical information source patient outcome . Skin problem reason many visit primary care provider result high percentage referral dermatologists return visit primary care skin problem . The objective evaluate impact primary care provider ' use dermatology information source , VisualDx , skin problem outcomes . The study design cluster-randomized controlled trial . Participants include primary care provider cluster patient skin problem . Providers randomize intervention group refers VisualDx see patient skin problem , control group . Patients randomize group status doctor saw problem . Patients interview determine problem status many follow-up visit problem interval index visit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Impact Dermatology Information Source Skin Problem Outcomes Primary Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The research design cluster randomize control trial computerized dermatology information source . This two-level design primary care provider ( PCPs ) see patient skin problem subject randomization . Their patient subject data collection analysis . The cluster design examine much variation outcome attributable provider , much patient within cluster , much intervention information source . Provider Level : After complete baseline questionnaire , provider randomize intervention control group . Intervention group provider orientation study protocol include access use VisualDx . Control provider receive protocol overview , orientation intervention . Intervention provider agree refer VisualDx content patient skin complaint . Control group provider agree use VisualDx reference may use another medical information source none . Patient Level : To identify eligible patient , authorize investigator review information patient record sufficient send letter provider 's signature notify study . The letter give option refuse contact . At 30 day primary care visit , study team investigator phone eligible patient , explains study , obtain verbal consent . The investigator blind randomize group status patient . The investigator proceeds interview questionnaire consent . Age , sex collect . Patients ask whether skin problem resolve ( `` Is well ? '' ) . For every resolve problem , ask ( date day since visit ) resolve . We also ask many return visit patient provider problem . If resolve , patient call 60 day ask question . If resolve , call patient 90 day . The last call patient 90 day index visit problem . Data Analysis Statistical Measures The primary predictor variable aim use VisualDx information source primary care provider . For `` day resolution '' outcome variable , time unit ( day ) status problem 90 day ( resolve resolve ) evaluate group Kaplan-Meier survival analysis non-parametric log rank test significance . For `` number follow-up visit '' outcome variable , binary predictor ( intervention group ) discrete outcome variable ( number visit ) evaluate Wilcoxon-rank sum test non-normal data . The first visit patient participate provider skin problem consider index visit provider consider index provider regardless provider see subsequent appointment . Analysis adhere intention-to-treat principle group assignment determine randomization regardless whether VisualDx deploy care . Problems unresolved last contact censor unresolved Kaplan-Meier analysis . For aim 1 , estimate sample size detect average difference 8 day time resolution standard deviation 20 intra-cluster correlation ( ICC ) 0.025 . With alpha .05 beta .80 , study would need minimum 26 provider enrol average 10 patient participant provider 's cluster total 286 participant complete study . We plan enroll least 30 provider 500 patient insure loss follow-up , increased standard deviation , large anticipate Intra-Cluster Correlation .</detailed_description>
