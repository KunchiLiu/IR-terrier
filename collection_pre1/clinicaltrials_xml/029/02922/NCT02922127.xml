	<brief_summary>Breast cancer account almost quarter cancer woman . In United States ( U.S. ) 2014 , 230,000 woman diagnose 40,000 die breast cancer . There urgent need develop acceptable mean prevent breast cancer high risk average risk woman . The propose study clinical trial premenopausal woman age 18-39 evaluate capacity daily Ulipristal Acetate ( UPA ) reduce breast epithelial cell proliferation ( increase number cell breast ) measure effect compare find combined estrogen-progestin oral contraceptive ( COC ) . UPA anti-progestin use daily medication 12 month treatment abnormally heavy bleed menstruation due uterine fibroid , currently trials U.S. evaluate use daily contraceptive . The investigator use breast biopsy compare breast cell proliferation , compare biopsy end 3 month treatment biopsy take baseline 2 group ( UPA COC ) . The investigator also compare change 2 group . The comparison effect UPA conventional COC UPA 's potential use daily contraceptive . Cell proliferation breast occur throughout menstrual cycle . The action hormone breast rapid anti-progestin UPA , block action progesterone breast , would predict quickly low breast cell proliferation premenopausal woman . Effects UPA uterus continue study reassuring . COC use find low breast cell proliferation associate decrease risk breast cancer . The change breast cell proliferation also compare change see breast MRI . If change highly correlated future study able do without need breast biopsy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This randomize controlled parallel group clinical trial blind evaluation carry 2 academic medical center : Columbia University Medical Center Weill Cornell Medical College . The investigator screen healthy woman age 18-39 meet inclusion/exclusion criterion enroll study . After informed consent process study enrollment , study participation begin baseline cycle . The main goal baseline cycle identify occurrence time ovulation . Starting day 6 baseline cycle , participant undergo blood sample progesterone ( P4 ) level interval every 2-3 day . An increase P4 great 3 ng/mL , confirm second value , indicate ovulation eligibility continue study . The participant 's baseline breast MRI biopsy ( see ) schedule occur mid luteal phase , 7 day first increase ( &gt; 3 ng/mL ) P4 . The investigator randomly assign breast first biopsy , woman return post-biopsy visit 7 day later . At post-biopsy visit , investigator assess acceptability MRI biopsy participant use visual analog scale ( VAS ) well interview . At begin next menstrual period , woman begin treatment phase study . They receive random assignment either UPA COC study center receive first dose 4-week supply study drug . During cycle 1 2 return study site every 2 week assessment , blood draw receive next cycle study drug . During third cycle , return study site twice weekly frequent test monitoring . Each cycle 28 day , correspond usual COC packaging . At day 75-77 treatment woman undergo second breast MRI , immediately follow biopsy contralateral breast biopsied baseline . An end-of-study visit , include check incision site repeat assessment acceptability MRI biopsy participant , occur 7 day later . Participants also ask rate preference MRI versus biopsy , possible study one procedure . Participants 24 study visit , visit , participant ask adverse event use concomitant medication . Participants high sensitivity urine pregnancy test baseline immediately precede MRI precede first dose study medication . Any participant positive pregnancy test immediately withdrawn study . Breast Biopsies Breast biopsy take place immediately follow breast MRI . Women receive 24-hour telephone follow-up , make visit within one week follow breast biopsy ensure biopsy site heal without incident . MRI For participant , baseline follow-up MRI do use machine . Each MRI study undergo immediate wet read assure adequate quality identify unexpected pathology would mandate clinical evaluation withdrawal study . A limited report indicate technical adequacy absence major clinical abnormality record patient record . Breast MRI breast biopsy visit take place Center Breast Imaging Columbia University Medical Center .</detailed_description>
