	<brief_title>Treatment Sleep Apnea Patients With Cervical Spinal Cord Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients cervical spinal cord injury demonstrate central sleep disorder breathe manifest central sleep apnea periodic breathing pattern . Understanding cause central sleep apnea may critically important understand upper airway obstruction susceptible individual , give critical role ventilatory motor output maintain upper airway patency evidence upper airway narrow occlusion nadir ventilator drive periodic breathing . This study likely identify therapeutic strategy could test large clinical trial , ultimate goal improve quality life among patient cervical SCI also experience central sleep disorder breathing . To end research proposal aim follow : Specific Aim 1 : Test hypothesis patient cervical SCI demonstrate great magnitude long-term facilitation ( LTF ) follow episodic hypoxia sleep , compare patient thoracic Spinal cord injury . This aim accomplish measure effect acute episodic hypoxic ventilation upper airway mechanic group . Specific Aim 2 : Test hypothesis dampen peripheral chemoreceptor activity patient cervical SCI central sleep disorder breathing ( SDB ) supplemental oxygen reduce central respiratory event decrease respiratory variability sleep . The aim accomplish provide supplemental oxygen participant cervical SCI central SDB . Specific Aim 3 : Test hypothesis administration trazodone , patient cervical spinal cord injury central SDB decrease respiratory relate arousal central apnea index , propensity develop central apnea , compare placebo . To accomplish aim , investigator test acute effect trazodone respiratory relate arousal central sleep apnea , chronic effect central apnea index CO2 reserve . The investigator study subject SCI T6 artificial ventilation . To characterize sleep breathe state subject , polysomnography upper airway collapsibility measure baseline . Then follow experiment conduct : episodic hypoxia protocol v normoxia use determine whether cervical SCI demonstrate great magnitude LTF . Experiments conduct see whether dampen peripheral chemoreceptor activity cervical SCI give supplemental oxygen reduce central respiratory event reduce breathe variability sleep . A cross experiment do see whether administration trazodone patient cervical SCI central SDB decrease respiratory-related arousal central apnea . The participant give drug/placebo one week cross 1 week wash period placebo .</detailed_description>
