	<brief_title>Assessment Infection Control , Practice Efficiency , Health Economics Sheathed Versus Standard Cystoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The increase cost health care enhanced infection control requirement necessitate efficient reliable use frequently use technique like cystoscopy . The health economics cystoscopy dependent maintain low level post-cystoscopy sequela like urinary tract infection ( UTI ) potential precursor , significant asymptomatic bacteriuria leukocytosis . Another key component economics efficiency cystoscopy time cost relate reprocess device preparation re-use . The use disposable endoscope sheath may limit need high level disinfection ( HLD ) procedures reduce reprocess time potentially prolong cystoscope lifespan . The rationale study determine sheathe cystoscopy system would provide desire cost efficiency advantage compare procedure do non-sheathed cystoscopes . This prospective , randomize , parallel group , single center clinical trial ass clinical outcome , practice efficiency health economics use sheathe cystoscopes ( EndoSheath® System ) compare use standard ( non-sheathed ) cystoscopes . The study evaluate infection control ( via change bacteriuria ) , clinical practice efficiency cost EndoSheath technology CST 5000 scope compare standard cystoscopy Olympus Visera Elite OTV-S190 digital flexible scope . There 30 subject control group undergo cystoscopy standard scope clinic , Olympus Visera Elite , 30 subject study group undergo cystoscopy EndoSheath system . The study design prospective , randomize control trial . There active blinding clinician subject ; however , anticipated subject unaware difference cystoscopy equipment utilized routine procedure .</detailed_description>
