	<brief_summary>T cell infiltration tumor lesion know prognostic factor several tumor type use treatment mechanism tumor type . In metastatic melanoma , treatment immune checkpoint inhibitor induce clinical benefit 30-50 % patient . These immune-based therapy however accompany serious immune-related adverse event high cost . Tumor infiltrate T cell express high affinity interleukin-2 ( IL2 ) receptor surface . These T cell could therefore visualized molecular image radio-labelled ligand receptor . For purpose , investigator develop PET tracer [ 18F ] FB-IL2 . The study commences biodistribution study ( phase 1 ) 5 subject . Thereafter main study ( phase 2 ) start , 25 subject receive two [ 18F ] FB-IL2 PET scan baseline week 6 treatment either ipilimumab , nivolumab , pembrolizumab combination ipilimumab nivolumab . If [ 18F ] FB-IL2 PET able detect response treatment , could serve non-invasive early indicator T cell response treatment . Besides , accumulation PET tracer non-target tissue could indicate infiltration activate T cell normal organ thus may predict development immune-related adverse event .</brief_summary>
