	<brief_summary>The investigator propose determine 8 week dietary augmentation oral 5g creatine monohydrate daily 100 mg 5-hydroxytryptophan ( 5-HTP ) twice daily reduces hypoxia-related depressive symptom measure 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HAM-D ) woman SSRI- SNRI-resistant depression , combine examination change functional connectivity base resting-state fMRI change brain metabolism infer phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Serotonin creatine process separately brain , deficit brain biochemicals lead distinct clinical problem . Therefore , investigator believe treatment combination therapy , could correct deficit , would synergistic effect treatment hypoxia-related depression possibly form treatment-resistant depression . Thus , investigator propose investigate antidepressant efficacy dietary 5-hydroxytryptophan ( 5-HTP ) creatine , mean restore brain neurotransmitter metabolic imbalance link chronic hypoxia cause high altitude residence .</detailed_description>
