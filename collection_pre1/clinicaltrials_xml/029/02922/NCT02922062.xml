	<brief_title>The Effects Consuming Palm Oil With Different Macronutrient Intakes Blood Lipids</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study determine effect palm oil blood lipid , cardiovascular health inflammation . Potential subject screen 24 qualify healthy participant enrol . After enrollment participant undergo baseline battery test include blood draw , body composition , measure height weight , blood lipid profile ( cholesterol , lipoprotein particle size , quantity fatty acid composition ) , insulin sensitivity use static index , inflammation , antioxidant status measurement energy expenditure substrate oxidation indirect calorimetry . Participants randomly divide one two arms/tracks , either low carbohydrate diet arm high carbohydrate diet arm . Each diet arm consist 3 phase low saturate fat control diet primary cooking oil canola oil two saturate fat diet phase primary cooking oil either palm oil butter . Participants begin low saturate fat diet phase first consist 50 % fat calorie derive canola oil 3 week . At end control diet phase battery test complete baseline repeat . After 2-week washout period participant proceed random order either palm oil butter diet phase diet arm/track . The palm oil butter diet phase also 3 week duration separate 2 week washout period . The palm oil butter diet phase derive 50 % fat calorie either palm oil butter . Both oil high saturate fat differ quality saturate fat . At end diet phase test battery complete baseline repeat . The subject never expose minimal risk return receive 9 week food , individualize report study result monetary stipend . The study help u good understand quality saturate fat quantity carbohydrate interact impact blood lipid cardiovascular health . This knowledge use aid dietary recommendation cardiovascular health control blood lipid .</detailed_description>
