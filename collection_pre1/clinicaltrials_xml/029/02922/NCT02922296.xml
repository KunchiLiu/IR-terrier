	<brief_summary>The purpose study well understand body handle sugar glucose fat , cholesterol triglyceride sickle cell disease , put certain person risk develop diabetes . This understanding may help u find new treatment control blood sugar prevent diabetes people without sickle cell disease ( SCD ) . In research , DNA RNA isolate blood cell . DNA use find gene cause protect diabetes , high cholesterol high triglyceride , RNA use study design find gene job eventually produce protein .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Glucose Metabolism Sickle Cell Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sickle cell disease ( SCD ) due homozygosity Glu6Val mutation HBB ( sickle cell anemia ; hemoglobin SS ) compound heterozygous form like hemoglobin SC disease hemoglobin S-Î² thalassemia . Past study suggest low prevalence diabetes patient SCD.10 Improvements treatment care increase life span patient . This , along wide availability high calorie diet increase adiposity SCD raise possibility prevalence diabetes increase SCD . Our study design characterize change metabolism occur sickle cell disease identify clinical , genetic genomic risk factor development diabetes . Our hypothesis non-overweight subject SCD relative protection diabetes metabolic syndrome , individual become overweight dramatic increase rate diabetes metabolic syndrome . Lean SCD subject simply neutral , overtly anti-diabetic phenotype ( e.g . well glucose tolerance lower metabolic syndrome marker ) . The two main study aim follow ; Aim 1 . Define metabolic status adult SCD subject accord normal increase BMI . Aim 2 . Determine genetic genomic predictor overweight , metabolic syndrome diabetes SCD subject .</detailed_description>
