	<brief_summary>The main objective study investigate non-inferiority oral flucloxacillin alone compare combination oral flucloxacillin phenoxymethylpenicillin emergency department direct outpatient treatment cellulitis , wound infection abscess , recently rename Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) acute bacterial skin skin structure infection ( ABSSSIs ) . Half trial participant receive flucloxacillin placebo combination , remain half treat flucloxacillin phenoxymethylpenicillin . In secondary objective trial aim measure adherence persistence trial patient outpatient antibiotic therapy . In addition within-trial evaluation cost per quality adjust life year ( QALY ) gain use oral flucloxacillin compare combination therapy perspective health-care payer ( direct cost ) patient government . Finally study externally validate Extremity Soft Tissue Infection-score , Health Related Quality Life ( HRQL ) questionnaire design quantify impact cellulitis , wound infection abscess patient HRQL clinical trial .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There obvious clinical equipoise use oral flucloxacillin alone combine phenoxymethylpenicillin emergency department treatment cellulitis , wound infection abscess evidence current disparate prescribing practice hospital guideline . Feasibility study plan trial show 45-50 % emergency department patient infection Ireland discharge oral antibiotic consistent finding jurisdiction . Despite significant healthcare economic cost associate cellulitis , paucity scientific evidence concern appropriate antibiotic treatment condition . Additionally , `` less severe '' infection tend over-treated severe infection under-treated , indicate unjustifiable level antibiotic misuse , insufficient knowledge therapeutic lack evidence risk-stratify patient cellulitis different treatments.The plan trial therefore likely definitive due current clinical equipoise use penicillins emergency department outpatient treatment group infection</detailed_description>
