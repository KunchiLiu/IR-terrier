	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine Panhematin safe effective prevention acute attack porphyria . The study aim provide high quality evidence use hemin prevention acute attack porphyria . A separate study progress evaluate use Panhematin treatment acute attack porphyria . Such study do previously treat prevent acute attack hemin . The lack strong evidence efficacy hemin treatment prevention attack limit availability patient acute porphyria .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled , parallel group trial investigate efficacy safety Panhematin™ prevent acute attack least 20 patient well-documented acute porphyria ( acute intermittent porphyria , hereditary coproporphyria variegate porphyria ) . These patient ( 1 . ) frequent attack past , symptom abdominal , back and/or limb pain diagnose exclusion cause , ( 2 . ) hemin prophylaxis prevention frequent attack . It expect patient 6 attack one year start hemin prophylaxis . This would consider justification preventive regimen hemin clinical ground . A single double blind dose Panhematin™ placebo give . An interim analysis carry completion 10 patient assess progress possibly adjust sample size . The trial consist follow : - A screening visit determine eligibility obtain informed consent - A treatment visit administration double blind prophylactic dose Panhematin™ placebo - Follow visit 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 week assess response infusion Panhematin™ placebo . These visit person telephone . - Additional visit may schedule need , example treatment symptom . - Follow-up visit 3 6 month end treatment either person telephone Patients laboratory documentation one acute porphyria . Molecular documentation also expect , although rarely causative mutation detect . Upon entry study give blinded fashion single preventive dose either Panhematin™ ( 4 mg/kg ) placebo . A recurrent attack within next 1 , 2 , 3 4 week represent treatment failure . Because study entry patient expect weekly prophylactic hemin treatment , hemin short-acting drug , emphasis analysis attack occur within 1 week study treatment . Any attack occur study treat accord standard care , may include Panhematin™ , either study site patient 's usual treatment location . It intend 20 patient complete treatment single blind dose least 4 week follow . A complete patient one meet entrance criterion , exclusion criterion complete single dose least one week follow , withdrawn adverse event .</detailed_description>

For type porphyria , inclusion criterion base 1 ) clinical feature , 2 ) biochemical finding , document laboratory report ( copy ) porphyriaspecific test , 3 ) molecular study identify mutation porphyriarelated gene . Equivocal biochemical measurement may require confirmatory test . Testing diseasecausing mutation must attempt , identify mutation essential enrollment , since know mutation find small fraction ( &lt; 5 % ) biochemically proven case porphyria . 1 .
