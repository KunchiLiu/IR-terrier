	<brief_summary>This project use data large network-model health maintenance organization operate Medicare Advantage ( MA ) plan ( CareMore ) fee-for-service Medicare data ( 1 ) good understand characteristic high-need , high-cost MA enrollees patient ( 2 ) evaluate impact care management program focus high-need high-cost MA enrollees end-stage renal disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Spending Outcomes Complex Medicare Advantage Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There two aim . Aim 1 describe categorize high-need , high-cost population . The investigator use CareMore inpatient , outpatient , pharmacy claim year 2010-2014 . The investigator construct mortality readmission risk category utilize traditional claims-based risk model develop sample data categorize patient risk level . For high health expenditure category , examine inpatient , outpatient , pharmacy data identify group patient drive disproportionate health spending . Finally , utilization investigator use claim outpatient visit data ( extent electronic health record ( EHR ) data becomes available ) identify patient disproportionate visit intensity . The approach describe patient within group categorize patient decile utilize multivariate regression model identify demographic , clinical , socioeconomic , geographic characteristic associate presence top decile along metric . For example , investigator describe individual cluster diagnosis associate high spending . They also examine patient meet multiple criterion describe associate characteristic . Aim 2 examine impact CareMore 's end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) care model . They use CareMore inpatient , outpatient , skilled nursing facility ( SNF ) , inpatient rehabilitation facility ( IRF ) , facility , pharmacy , post-acute care claim Center Medicare Medicaid ( CMS ) Fee-For-Service ( FFS ) data match geography . They also attempt obtain healthcare effectiveness data information set ( HEDIS ) data health plan patient physician level , CMS star measure data , available electronic medical record ( EMR ) data , physician characteristic data extent CareMore provide . They perform retrospective analysis claim data . The investigator use primary comparison group ESRD patient Medicare FFS , particularly locality ESRD special need plan ( SNP ) offer mitigate effect selection . The team also explore second comparison group CareMore traditional MA plan enrollees develop ESRD . They first examine patient , physician , plan site characteristic associated variation utilization specialize service include enhanced nutritional counseling , personalize care plan , dialysis treatment evaluation , supplemental medical evaluation -- use logistic regression . Second , perform descriptive analysis association use service cost quality outcome .</detailed_description>
