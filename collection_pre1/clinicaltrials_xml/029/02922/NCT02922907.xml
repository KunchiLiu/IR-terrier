	<brief_title>Rice Bran Supplementation Treated HIV Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : HIV infect person great level inflammation immune activation compare general population great risk develop coronary heart disease ( CHD ) inflammation-associated co-morbidities . Intervention BRM4 ( Arabinoxylan Rice Bran Supplementation ) population impair immune reconstitution may improve inflammation variety mechanism . Intervention : Arabinoxylan Rice Bran Supplementation BRM4 , nutritional supplement market US . It compose dietary fiber obtain denature hemicellulose obtain react rice bran hemicellulose multiple carbohydrate hydrolyzing enzyme Shiitake mushroom . Objectives : The primary objective evaluate 12 week supplementation arabinoxylan rice bran safely reduce marker inflammation ART-suppressed HIV infection thus potentially reduce potential develop end-organ disease group at-risk patient . Study population : HIV-infected participant ( ≥18 year age ) stable ART least 24 week prior study entry , impaired immune reconstitution define CD4+ T-cell count 100-350 cells/mm3 prior study entry , plasma HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL . In order assure 24 evaluable subject , investigator enroll 28 subject total ( assume 15 % lose follow-up rate ) . Study methodology : Randomized , double blind , placebo control clinical trial Description study arm : At entry participant randomize one follow arm : Arm 1 : BRM4 two 500mg capsule thrice daily p.o . 12 week Arm 2 : Placebo Biobran two capsule thrice daily p.o . 12 week Study endpoint : Primary - change sCD14 level 12 week intervention . Secondary - week 12 change inflammatory marker , microbial translocation , T-cell count , metabolic variable . Follow-up : Participants follow study completion , unless follow-up necessary adverse event . Statistics : A total sample 24 evaluable subject ( 12 per arm ) need detect clinically relevant difference 0.07 log10 sCD14 level treatment vs. placebo arm 90 % power 0.05 two-sided type I error rate . Plans analysis : For primary analysis , change sCD14 ( biomarkers ) baseline week 12 compare treatment arm placebo arm two-sided , two-sample t-test .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Documented HIV1 infection Currently combination antiretroviral regimen ≥24 week prior study entry interruption longer 7 consecutive day period . Plasma HIV1 RNA level 50 copies/mL least 24 week prior study entry . CD4+ cell count 100350 cells/mm3 obtain within 90 day prior study entry . The following laboratory value obtain within 90 day prior entry US laboratory CLIA certification equivalent . Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥750/mm3 Hemoglobin ≥8.0 g/dL Platelet count ≥50,000/mm3 Calculated creatinine clearance ( CrCl ) ≥50 mL/min estimate CockroftGault formula Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ( SGOT ) ≤5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) . alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) ( SGPT ) ≤5 x ULN . alkaline phosphatase ≤5 x ULN . Total bilirubin ≤2.5 x ULN ( participant receiving atazanavir , total bilirubin ≤5 x ULN acceptable ) For female reproductive potential ( woman postmenopausal least 24 consecutive month , i.e . menses within 24 month prior study entry ) , woman undergo surgical sterilization ( specifically hysterectomy bilateral oophorectomy tubal ligation ) , require negative serum urine pregnancy test ( latter sensitivity 1525 mIU/mL ) within 2 day prior entry . If participate sexual activity could lead pregnancy , female study volunteer must willing use contraceptive receive protocolspecified medication Men woman age 18 year great . Ability willingness participant legal guardian/representative provide inform consent . Participants statin therapy must stable dose least prior 12 week anticipate change statin dose intervention Change ART regimen within 12 week prior study entry , anticipated/intended modification ART study period . Two HIV1 RNA determination &gt; 200 copies/mL within 48 week period prior study entry . Use immunomodulator , HIV vaccine , investigational therapy , antiTNF therapy within 90 day prior study entry . Active malignancy expect need systemic chemotherapy radiation therapy study period . Pregnant breastfeeding . Known allergy/sensitivity rice , rice bran , mushroom , relate food product . Active drug alcohol use dependence , opinion site investigator , would interfere adherence study requirement . Acute serious illness require systemic treatment and/or hospitalization within 90 day prior entry .</criteria>
