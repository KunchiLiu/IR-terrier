	<brief_summary>The purpose study therefore evaluate effect concomitant drug know affect solubility drug increase intra-gastric pH level bioavailability entinostat . The primary objective study evaluate effect multiple dose omeprazole , famotidine , effect acidic beverage single-dose PK profile entinostat . The secondary objective evaluate safety tolerability single dose entinostat administer multiple dos omeprazole , famotidine , administer acidic beverage .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Examine Effect Omeprazole , Famotidine , Acidic Beverage Pharmacokinetics Entinostat Healthy Adult Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This 3-part study . A total 204 subject dose study Parts 2 3 conduct . In Part 1 , Period 1 , single dose entinostat administer . In Period 2 , multiple dos omeprazole administer 5 day single dose entinostat co-administered . If preliminary result Period 2 Part 1 indicate omeprazole exhibit clinically significant drug-drug interaction ( DDI ) entinostat , Parts 2 3 conduct . If DDI interaction conclude entinostat omeprazole Part 1 , neither Part 2 3 conduct . Part 2 investigate effect multiple dos famotidine administration entinostat PK . In Period 1 , single dose entinostat administer . In Period 2 , oral dos famotidine single dose entinostat co-administered . Part 3 evaluate effect acidic beverage co-administered entinostat subject increase gastric pH due omeprazole treatment . In Period 1 , multiple oral dos omeprazole administer single dose entinostat co-administered water . In Period 2 , multiple dos omeprazole administer single dose entinostat co-administered acidic beverage . In part , PK sample take .</detailed_description>
