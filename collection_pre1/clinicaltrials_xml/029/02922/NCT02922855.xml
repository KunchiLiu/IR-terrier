	<detailed_description>A randomize control trial ( RCT ) incentives initial primary care visit within 6 month enrollment health care coverage program . Study subject draw low-income adult population gain coverage access community-based primary care service program administer academic safety-net hospital . The investigator offer financial incentive encourage initial primary care visit within 6 month enrollment evaluate whether primary care visit alter subsequent health seek behavior influence patient satisfaction outcomes self-reported health status . Incentives steer patient decision seek primary care , reduce barrier care , ultimately improve patient health reduce utilization cost relationship PCP . This study first kind incentivize low-income patient . This population great need health care exert great pressure United States ' safety net system . Furthermore , safety net population target policy Medicaid eligibility expansion , yet urban safety net patient largely understudied . These patient rarely give opportunity participate research , subject measure reduce health care utilization , subject policy use negative incentive introduce cost sharing use ED services.1 Alternatively , safety net provider invest case management system reduce utilization . The propose study departure prior measure reduce utilization among low-income patient focus patient use positive incentive . The study borrow principle behavioral economics motivate patient towards primary care utilization . Once primary care system , The investigator test whether primary care contact reduces expensive form ( e.g. , inpatient , ED ) health care . The investigator compare outcomes patient assign high incentive group ( $ 50 ) patient assign modest incentive group ( $ 25 ) patient assign usual care ( incentive , assignment PCP ) . The investigator also compare incentive patient ( $ 50 , $ 25 ) contemporaneous group patient enroll safety net clinic time .</detailed_description>
