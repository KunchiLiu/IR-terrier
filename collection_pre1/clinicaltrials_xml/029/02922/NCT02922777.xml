	<detailed_description>Lung cancer remain leading cause cancer-related death worldwide estimate incidence 1.6 million case result 1.4 million death annually . Non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) represent 80-85 % case , adenocarcinoma common histology.2 The majority NSCLC patient present advanced metastatic disease amenable surgical resection . Platinum-based combination chemotherapy reach therapeutic plateau median overall survival ( OS ) 7.4 9.9 month . BGB324 potent selective small molecule inhibitor Axl , surface membrane protein kinase receptor over-expressed many metastatic solid tumor identify marker poor prognosis patient non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>A patient eligible study follow criterion meet : 1 . Provision write informed consent participate investigational study 2 . Histologically cytologically confirm advanced ( stage 4 , accord American Joint Committee Cancer [ AJCC ] Staging manual ) NSCLC 3 . Up three previous line therapy , one must platinumbased doublet therapy two cytotoxic chemotherapy . 4 . Radiographic disease recurrence progression last line chemotherapy 5 . Patients know activate EGFR mutation ALK rearrangement progress appropriate target treatment addition progress platinumbased doublet chemotherapy 6 . European Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 1 7 . Age 18 year old 8 . Measurable evaluable disease accord RECIST v1.1 9 . Previously treat brain metastasis ( surgery and/or radiation therapy ) eligible , provide patient asymptomatic require corticosteroid 10 . The following minimum interval require prior treatment initiation study therapy : Cytotoxic chemotherapy : 3 week Molecularly target therapy immunotherapy : 2 week Conventional fractionate radiation therapy : 2 week Stereotactic radiation therapy : 1 week Major surgery : 3 week 11 . Adequate hematologic function ( absolute neutrophil count [ ANC ] ≥ 1500 cells/µL ; hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL ; platelet ≥ 100,000/µL 12 . Adequate renal function ( serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL calculate creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min use CockcroftGault equation ) 13 . Adequate hepatic function : total bilirubin ≤ upper limit normal [ ULN ] , alanine aminotransferase [ ALT ] ≤ 1.5 x ULN , aspartate aminotransferase [ AST ] ≤ 1.5 x ULN ) . ALT AST ≤ 5x ULN document liver metastasis 14 . Previous treatmentassociated toxicity resolve CTCAE grade ≤2 ( except alopecia ) 15 . Adequate archival tissue ( 1015 slide , 5 slide 3 section per slide ) biomarker analysis 16 . Female patient childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test within 7 day prior take first dose BGB324 . Male patient female patient reproductive potential must agree practice highly effective method contraception ( hormonal implant , combine oral contraceptive , injectable contraceptive , intrauterine device hormone spiral , total sexual abstinence , vasectomy ) throughout study ≥3 month last dose BGB324 . Female patient consider NOT childbearing potential history surgical sterility , include tubal ligation , evidence postmenopausal status define follow : Natural menopause last menses &gt; 1 year ago Radiation induce oophorectomy last menses &gt; 1 year ago Chemotherapy induce menopause last menses &gt; 1 year ago Exclusion Criteria A patient exclude study follow criterion meet : 1 . Pregnant lactate 2 . Abnormal leave ventricular ejection fraction echocardiography ( less low limit normal patient age treat institution &lt; 45 % ) 3 . History ischemic cardiac event include myocardial infarction within 3 month study entry 4 . NSCLC evidence centrally cavitating lesion 5 . Peripheral neuropathy NCI CTCAE ≥Grade 2 baseline 6 . Pulmonary hemorrhage hemoptysis &gt; 2.5 mL blood within 6 week ( within 2 week source definitively treat [ eg , radiation therapy bronchoscopic procedure ] ) 7 . Congestive cardiac failure &gt; Grade 2 severity accord NYHA define symptomatic less ordinary level activity 8 . Unstable cardiac disease , include unstable angina unstable hypertension , define need change medication lack disease control within last three month 9 . History presence sustain bradycardia ( less equal 60 BPM ) history symptomatic bradycardia , leave bundle branch block , cardiac pacemaker significant atrial tachyarrhythmias , define need treatment 10 . Previous treatment docetaxel Axl inhibitor 11 . Current treatment agent may prolong QT interval may cause Torsade de Points discontinue least five halflives prior treatment . Please see Appendix J list relevant medication 12 . Known family personal history long QTc syndrome ventricular arrhythmia include ventricular bigeminy 13 . Previous history Grade 3 worse druginduced QTc prolongation require treatment withdrawal 14 . Screening 12lead ECG measurable QTc interval accord Fridericia 's correction &gt; 450 m 15 .
