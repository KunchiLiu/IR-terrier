	<brief_summary>The purpose study look patient respond treatment guadecitabine pembrolizumab . The researcher also look amount time take cancer get bad participant take study drug . All participant treat guadecitabine pembrolizumab . Guadecitabine interfere cancer cell ' DNA increase production certain protein , make cancer cell recognizable immune system . Pembrolizumab help immune system kill cancer cell . Thus combination guadecitabine pembrolizumab may increase ability immune system eliminate cancer cell . Researchers want find whether combination guadecitabine pembrolizumab effective treating ovarian cancer respond traditional chemotherapy . Participants keep receive treatment cancer get bad , side effect , decide n't want receive treatment anymore . After stop treatment , study doctor watch participant side effect follow condition every 6-12 week . The study aim keep track participant ' medical condition rest live . This help u look long-term effect study drug .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Measure objective response rate ( RR ) guadecitabine pembrolizumab subject recurrent platinum resistant ovarian cancer ( OC ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Measure progression free survival ( PFS ) combination guadecitabine pembrolizumab . II . Progression free survival ( PFS ) . III . Measure clinical benefit rate ( CBR ) combination guadecitabine pembrolizumab . IV . Measure toxicity profile combination guadecitabine pembrolizumab . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I. NY-ESO-1 MAGE antigen ' promoter methylation ( pyrosequencing ) messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA ) expression level ( quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction [ RT-PCR ] ) measure treatment deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) ( plasma and/or tumor biopsy ) ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) ( tumor biopsy ) , respectively . II . Cytokine response ( IFN gamma IL2 , IL6 , IL10 , TNF alpha ) measure plasma enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) . III . Measure LINE 1 methylation DNA extract peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) ( measure day 1 5 cycle 1 2 ) . IV . Expression PD-L1 ligand measure immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) archival tumor . V. Tumor infiltrate lymphocyte ( TILs ) quantify tumor biopsy treatment ( IHC ) . OUTLINE : Patients receive guadecitabine subcutaneously ( SC ) day 1-4 pembrolizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 5 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day , every 6 week 1 year , every 9 week , subject experience confirm disease progression start new anticancer therapy , every 3 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
