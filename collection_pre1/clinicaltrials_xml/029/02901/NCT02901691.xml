	<brief_summary>The deaf child show deficit speech processing temporality . They badly apprehend temporal concept perception deficit acoustic phenomenon mark time course linguistically . Their prediction capability anticipation multisensory event thereby affect , thus impact ability adapt multiple complex interaction possibility arise conversation.The project aim measure impact musical rhythmic stimulation neuronal activity temporal prediction capability older deaf child 5 8 year impact language skill conversational task . A matched control group age examine propose task . We first measure capacity anticipate situation language interaction . For purpose , use alternate name paradigm virtual partner , already develop tested child normal hearing . This paradigm approach conversational situation allow control time parameter speech ( speed trade ) control bias ( temporal ) inherent linguistic programming difficulty child spontaneous conversation situation . Then couple behavioral measurement measurement eye movement electroencephalogram ( EEG ) deaf child . For , use dialog observation task already develop normal hearing child . This task allow u firstly analyze anticipation level speak turn analyze eye movement ( `` precedes '' speaker ) . Secondly , allow u study effect manipulation acoustic parameter auditory evoke potential ( AEP ) oscillatory activity motor system ( EEG , mu rhythm beta ) . The audiomoteur couple would seem key point anticipatory process convergence conversational interaction also study use cortico-cortical coherence technique assess dynamic connectivity remote network ( system auditory motor system ) .</brief_summary>
