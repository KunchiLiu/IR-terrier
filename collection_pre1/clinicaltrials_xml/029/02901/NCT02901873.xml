	<brief_summary>Parathyroid glands involved calcium metabolism damage neck surgery result 'hypoparathyroidism ' , condition characterize 'low blood calcium ' levels; associate significant short long term morbidity . There four parathyroid gland neck vary size location . They mistake lymph node , fat thyroid nodule . A normal parathyroid gland size small pea often difficult recognize surgery; make susceptible inadvertent injury removal . Thyroid parathyroid surgery commonly perform UK . Prompt accurate identification parathyroid tissue surgery reduce likelihood hypoparathyroidism . However , complication still common . Research explore use intraoperative technology enable early identification preservation normal parathyroid gland surgery ongoing . Electrical impedance spectroscopy ( EIS ) one technology . ZedScanTM handheld device measure electrical impedance tissue . It currently use adjunct colposcopy cervical cancer screening . The device CE mark purpose safe use human . We already demonstrate electrical impedance spectroscopy detect difference cellular structure differentiate tissue rabbit neck . We aim demonstrate feasibility use technology ( ZedScanTM ) humans . This potential used thyroid parathyroid surgery differentiate parathyroid glands structures; thereby decrease damage risk post surgical hypothyroidism .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>EIS Thyroid Parathyroid Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients undergo thyroid and/or parathyroid surgery include . Both group include identification thyroid and/or PGs routine part operation provide EI measurement normal abnormal parathyroid thyroid tissue . There potential EIS useful procedure . Patients identified Endocrine Surgery outpatient clinic Royal Hallamshire Hospital , Sheffield Teaching Hospitals . They invite take part study appointment interested take part give information include participant information sheet . The patient approach either preassessment clinic appointment day surgery gain write consent . Participants follow outpatient clinic per routine care . No extra visit hospital require take part study . At procedure ( usually carry general anaesthesia ) , thyroid and/or parathyroid gland ( ) central compartment neck expose mobilise prior excision . During procedure prior devascularisation excision gland , handheld ZedScanTM use take vivo measurement thyroid , parathyroid , adipose tissue , lymph node muscle . Each measurement perform 14 different frequency ( range 76 625000 Hz ) around 20 millisecond . The measurement repeat soon excision appropriate structure enable ex vivo reading . The temperature patient time vivo measurement record anaesthetist temperature specimen time ex vivo measurement also record . Care take apply amount pressure tissue type . Any extra reading clearly document CRF . A photograph operate field may take reference analyse measurement . After take measurement , data download laptop computer transform measure mean EI SD frequency . Histology result specimen excise review along patient 's postoperative calcium level hospital reporting system . The patient 's follow outpatient clinic appointment note also review symptoms management postoperative low calcium</detailed_description>
