	<brief_summary>Gastric cancer one major health problem worldwide , one lead cause death especially Asia . Though cytotoxic chemotherapy main treatment option , new molecularly target agent recently incorporate improve survival outcome . Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 , ErbB2 ) transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor overexpressed amplified 10-20 % gastric cancer . Recently , Trastuzumab Gastric Cancer ( ToGA ) study report clinical benefit trastuzumab HER2 positive gastric cancer patient . However , majority patient develop intrinsic acquire resistance within 1 year , elucidate molecular mechanism trastuzumab resistance warrant improve survival outcome HER2 positive gastric cancer patient . A grow body preclinical clinical evidence show immune system contributes substantially therapeutic effect `` monoclonal antibody , trastuzumab '' solid tumor . Pembrolizumab potent highly selective humanize monoclonal antibody design directly block interaction PD-1 ligands , PD-L1 PD-L2 . Based strong rationale explore impact combine trastuzumab anti-PD-1 inhibitor HER2 positive cancer , suggest multicenter phase IB/II study determine antitumor activity safety pembrolizumab combination standard treatment ( trastuzumab , capecitabine , cisplatin ) patient HER2 positive gastric cancer .</brief_summary>
