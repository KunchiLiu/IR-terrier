	<brief_summary>Refractory glaucoma often require vision-sparing trabeculectomy . To increase surgical success , adjunctive pharmacotherapy utilized albeit risk adverse event . This prospective trial randomizes adult uncontrolled glaucoma ass emerge heal modulatory strategy . Over 1-year follow-up , trabeculectomy complement intracameral delivery anti-angiogenic bevacizumab ( 1.25 mg ) compare standard trabeculectomy anti-fibrotic mitomycin-C ( 0.02 % ; apply 2 minute ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab Versus Mitomycin C Trabeculectomy Adjuvant Uncontrolled Glaucoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , parallel , randomized , comparative , interventional feasibility study . Eyes Caucasian patient medically uncontrolled glaucoma intolerance glaucoma medication , evaluate glaucoma service Athens Vision Eye Institute schedule filtration surgery within one calendar year , enrol . If eyes one patient eligible one eye randomly select . Inclusion criterion include adult patient primary secondary open angle angle closure glaucoma preoperative intraocular pressure ( IOP ) &gt; 21 mmHg maximally tolerate medical therapy least 2 occasion prior randomization ability attend regular follow-up . Exclusion criterion include age ( &lt; 18 year ) , pregnancy , severe ocular surface disease , need combine phacotrabeculectomy , uveitic neovascular glaucoma , prior intraocular surgery except uncomplicated phacoemulsification history systemic thromboembolic event within 6 month surgery . The research adhere tenet Declaration Helsinki approve Human Research Ethics Committee Athens Vision Eye Institute . Informed consent grant patient preoperatively explain indication risk procedure . All patient recruit principal investigator surgeon ( GK ) . The study unblinded patient investigator . Eyes randomly assign 2 treatment arm online random number generator ( www.random.org ) : `` mitomycin C group '' undergoes standard guard trabeculectomy supplement mitomycin C ( Kyowa , Galabank Business Park , UK ) ; `` bevacizumab group '' undergoes guard trabeculectomy single 1.25 mg intracameral injection bevacizumab ( Roche , Welwyn Garden City , UK ) . The online random number generator access individual patient nursing staff ( circulate nurse ) , unaware study design patient 's characteristic , immediately prior surgical procedure . Sample size analysis ( www.powerandsamplesize.com ) reveal power 80 % assume 5 % type I error , average post-op intraocular pressure 12mmHg similar sample ratio , 13 eye group necessary detect 3mmHg difference IOP twelve month ( superiority non-inferiority design ) . Assuming dropout rate 30 % 5 year investigator aim 20 eye study group . Furthermore , power analysis reveals power 80 % assume 5 % type I error , surgical success rate 90 % 1 year similar sampling ratio , 20 eye group necessary detect 24 % difference rate surgical success twelve month ( superiority non-inferiority design ) . Before surgery , patient undergo comprehensive eye examination include slit lamp biomicroscopy , best correct visual acuity ( BCVA ) determination , intraocular pressure measurement use Goldmann applanation tonometry ( GAT ) least 2 separate occasion perform one week apart , gonioscopy dilate fundus examination . All patient least one visual field test file , perform 6 month prior randomization . The Humphrey Visual Field Analyzer ( HFA II-i , Carl Zeiss Meditec Inc , Dublin , CA , USA ) use 24/2 SITA-Standard protocol utilized instance . Preoperative data collect medical record individual patient include age , race , sex , diagnosis , study eye , BCVA , number type glaucoma medication , intraocular pressure , global visual field index , central corneal thickness ( CCT ) , cup disc ratio , number type previous intraocular surgery previous glaucoma laser procedure . All pseudophakic eye history primary open angle exfoliation glaucoma , undergone uneventful cataract extraction posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation . Patients examine post-operative day one , day three , week one every week thereafter first month , subsequently post-operative month 1 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 . A window + 1 week allow 1st 3rd month post-operative visit , window + 2 week allow 6th , 9th 12th month post-operative visit . During visit comprehensive ophthalmic examination carry . This include intraocular pressure measurement , glaucoma medication requirement update , BCVA , review early late complication relate surgery ( i.e. , blebitis , bleb leak ) additional surgical intervention . These data record patient ' medical record extract tabulate Excel 2013 spreadsheet ( Microsoft , Redmond , WA ) individual participate patient 's management decision blind respect treatment assignment . Subsequently , data analyze separate individual reveals study group assignment calculates mean , surgical success rate complication rate . All patient ' data dealt confidentiality . Statistical comparison perform accord initial treatment group assignment ( intention treat analysis ) . Additional post-operative visit and/or intervention slit lamp 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) injection , bleb needlings laser suture lyses discretion treat ophthalmologist qualify failure . BCVA record certified optometrist utilize clear chart digital screen ( Reichert , Depew , NY , USA ) place 4 m. All patient undergo 24/2 Swedish Interactive Threshold Algorithm ( SITA ) Standard Automated Perimetry ( SAP ) annual basis post-operative period . SAP repeat typically within one month unreliable .</detailed_description>
