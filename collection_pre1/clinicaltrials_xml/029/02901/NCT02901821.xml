	<brief_title>Predicting Concussion Outcomes With Salivary miRNA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study characterize alteration miRNA expression 100 child mTBI compare 50 age-and gender-matched control identify differentially express miRNAs 100 child mTBI predict length severity concussive symptom . Hypothesis : Specific miRNAs differentially regulate child mTBI expression level associate medical demographic characteristic age , gender , previous mTBI , symptom type , mechanism injury . The investigator predict set miRNAs differential expression child mTBI statistically associate functional measure mTBI symptom well duration concussive symptom . Rationale : Preliminary study show miRNA alter adult vary degree TBI salivary miRNA alter disorder CNS . These study indicate serum-based miRNA may use accurate biomarker differentiate adult without TBI . Whether similar pattern see saliva child follow mTBI remain see . Furthermore , influence confound variable gender , mechanism injury , previous mTBIs miRNA profile explore . The investigator propose investigate question examine salivary miRNA 100 child ( age five twenty-one year ) clinical diagnosis mTBI 50 age-and gender-matched control , recruit Penn State Pediatric Concussion Clinic affiliate primary care clinic ( 35 Hope Drive ) . The investigator plan prospectively follow 100 child mTBI eight week post-concussion , track symptom Child Sports Concussion Assessment Tool ( SCAT-3 ) via phone interview two time-points ( 4 8 week date initial mTBI ) . Expression salivary miRNA take initial presentation compare symptom duration ( acute &lt; 4 week , versus chronic &gt; 4 week ) severity ( measure numerically SCAT-3 self-report ) . The investigator plan identify set salivary miRNAs easily use predict clinical course pediatric patient follow diagnosis mTBI .</detailed_description>
