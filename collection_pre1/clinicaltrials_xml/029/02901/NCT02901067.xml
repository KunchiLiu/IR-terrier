	<detailed_description>This protocol describe Phase II , pragmatic , prospective , randomize , double-blind , adaptive clinical trial compare combination rosuvastatin aspirin therapy placebo . Currently , treatment fibrinolysis shutdown effective measure prevent macro- micro-thrombosis post-injury , thus , placebo acceptable control group . Treatment group would otherwise standard care , include pharmacologic thromboembolism prophylaxis . The safety concomitant use VTE pharmacological prophylaxis statin aspirin well document cardiac surgery patient . Eligible adult patient anticipate ICU admission screen eligibility STAT trial ( see inclusion/exclusion criterion ) base history , physical exam clinical data obtain initial treatment . If deem eligible enrollment STAT trial , patient , legally authorize representative ( LAR ) , proxy decision-maker contact on-site professional research assistant ( PRAs ) consent enroll study . Only patient consent obtain within 24 hour post-injury eligible randomization treatment phase study . Upon consent , blood sample obtain immediately consent 6 , 12 , 24 , 48 , 72 , 120 168 hour injury . Traditional tPA-Challenge TEG perform sample evaluate development three fibrinolysis phenotype . Upon receive order prophylactic anticoagulation , DHMC pharmacy randomize patient control intervention arm study . Randomization occur use computer-generated block ( group 20 patient ) random number sequence seal , opaque envelope maintain DHMC pharmacy . Patients assign intervention arm receive standard care anticoagulation plus combination experimental drug ( 20mg rosuvastatin daily 325mg aspirin ) daily either orally crush via feed tube . These dos consistent currently recommend postoperative period follow cardiac surgery . Patients assign control group receive identical-looking placebo time point experimental group either orally crush via feed tube . Healthcare provider , PRAs patient blind study allocation standard care anticoagulation plus combination placebo ( produced look group assignment ( double blind design ) . The DHMC pharmacist aware patient 's treatment arm rapid un-blinding possible event adverse event possibly relate study medication . The blood sample use monitor type fibrinolysis , function biochemical mediator coagulation potential side effect medication , explain detail . Study medication placebo administer ICU admission patient receive standard care dose prophylactic anticoagulation ( i.e . heparin heparin-derivatives ) interrupt concomitantly interruption pharmacological VTE prophylaxis . Patients diagnose VTE withdrawn study drug receive appropriate VTE treatment per current ICU protocol . The investigator monitor function/damage liver , renal muscle initiation therapy ( patient already recent test function 12 hour prior initiation therapy , result test use avoid unnecessary sampling ) , upon end therapy clinically necessary ( i.e. , clinical indication organ dysfunction ) . Stopping rule : 1 . Bleeding : Any ongoing bleeding require blood transfusion operative procedure . Bleeding monitor via monitor daily measurement hemoglobin level , integral part ICU protocols trauma patient . Study medication unblinded stop drop hemoglobin level great 2 g/dl within 24 hour start study medication , drop hemoglobin level great 1 g/dl daily three consecutive day follow start treatment , requirement &gt; =1 unit red blood cell operative procedure stop bleed start study medication ; 2 . Liver dysfunction : Alteration liver chemistry rare sequela statin therapy . A meta-analysis 13 placebo-controlled trial incorporate nearly 50,000 patient examine incidence liver toxicity ( defined elevation hepatic transaminase great 3 time upper limit normal ) patient receive statin therapy . 77 This study report incidence elevate AST ALT statin-treated patient vs placebo control 1.14 % 1.05 % , respectively ( OR 1.25 ; 95 % CI 0.99-1.62 ) . Further , individual drug associate statistically significant elevation transaminases follow-up interval exceed 3 year fluvastatin . These recent data inform expert opinion , 78 ultimately prompt FDA 2012 revoke recommendation liver function test monitor patient take statin . That say , give at-risk patient population , investigator use accepted definition 3 time upper limit normal criterion interruption therapy ; 3 . Renal dysfunction : While transient proteinuria observe patient undergo statin therapy , acute kidney injury ( AKI ) rare complication . The JUPITER randomize control trial incorporate approximately 17,000 patient compare rosuvastatin placebo find difference AKI ( 6.0 % v 5.4 % ; p = 0.08 ) group . 79 In randomize trial compare rosuvastatin atorvastatin , simvastatin pravastatin , acute renal failure observe 2 420 patient receive high-dose rosuvastatin . 80 The investigator define AKI serum creatinine increase great 2x baseline ( &gt; Grade 1 , base AKIN criterion ) criterion interrupt therapy . 4 . Muscle injury : Myositis rhabdomyolysis rare sequela statin therapy . A meta-analysis 26 study incorporate nearly 130,000 patient identify incidence 1 4 per 10,000 patient develop rhabdomyolysis follow statin therapy . 81 This meta-analysis include study 12,000 patient compare efficacy simvastatin 80mg 20mg dos . In study , overall incidence myolysis rhabdomyolysis 0.5 0.1 per 1000 person-years , respectively , wherein case rhabdomyolysis occur high dose cohort . The accepted definition myositis muscle pain set serum creatinine kinase concentration great 10 time upper limit normal . use threshold clinically quantify myositis , precede potential development rhabdomyolysis , well criterion interrupt therapy . Any mentioned stopping rule report SAE trigger immediate review DSMB .</detailed_description>
