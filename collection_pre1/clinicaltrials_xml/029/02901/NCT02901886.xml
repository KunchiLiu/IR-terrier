	<brief_title>REU-stop - Effect Intensive Smoking Cessation Intervention Smoking Cessation Disease Activity Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tobacco smoke well-known environmental risk factor develop rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) . The onset RA occur age group , majority woman age 50-60 year . RA chronic inflammatory disease cure . However , activity disease reduce medication . During period high disease activity , patient experience increase pain fatigue subsequent restriction social life , psychical activity activity daily life . Furthermore , inflammatory process underlie RA cause pain , fatigue , reduce health-related quality life reduce physical function . Patients RA increase risk cardiovascular disease similar risk demonstrate patient diabetes . Furthermore , several study indicate smoker inflammatory arthritis tend experience pain fatigue , reduce quality life compare non-smokers . The primary aim study examine intensive smoking cessation intervention lead smoke cessation reduce disease activity patient RA . Secondary aim examine effect risk cardiovascular disease , lung function , psychical function , health-related quality life , pain fatigue patient RA . Material Methods Study design : A multicenter randomize 2-armed control intervention study ( RCT ) . It possible blind patient smoke cessation counsellor intervention . All outcome assess blind outcome assessor . Data remain secondary outcome patient-reported . Baseline outcome data collect baseline randomization , 3 month , 6 month , 12 month post intervention . Study setting : Patients recruit rheumatology outpatient clinic University Hospital Rigshospitalet - Glostrup ( Capital Region Denmark ) , Frederiksberg Hospital ( Capital Region Denmark ) Preventive Cardio-Rheuma Clinic , Diakonhjemmet Hospital Oslo , Norway . Randomization blinding : After accept participation study , baseline data collect . Following , patient randomize use computer-generated stratified block randomization ( block 6-10 patient ) . Patients allocate 1:1 either 1 ) intervention group ( N = 75 ) 2 ) control group ( N = 75 ) . Data collection : Outcomes assess four time 13.5 month post-intervention : 1 ) baseline 2 ) 3 month post-intervention 3 ) 6 month post-intervention 4 ) 12 post-intervention . At baseline , patient ask complete self-reported questionnaire regard demographic , lifestyle , smoke history , consumption pain medication alcohol consumption . Charlson 's co-morbidity Scale use assess co-morbidity base data patient 's chart . In addition , data medical treatment , IgM-RF ( rheumatoid factor ) Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide ( Anti-CCP ) status obtain DANBIO registry . At subsequent follow-up , patient ask complete self-reported questionnaire regard smoking status , disease activity ( FLARE instrument ) , psychical function ( HAQ ) , health-related quality life ( SF-36 EQ-5D ) , pain ( VAS scale ) fatigue ( BRAF-NRS ) . All patient-reported questionnaire complete electronically use tablet . The tablet exclusively use study . Arterial stiffness , blood pressure , pulse , weight waist circumference assess baseline follow-up visit . Blood sample draw analyze C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , triglyceride , cholesterol level HbA1c . All outcome exclude patient-reported outcome assess project nurse blind patient ' group allocation . Ethics , confidentiality dissemination : The study carry accordance Helsinki Declaration . The study approve The Regional Committee Health Research Ethics ( H-16022001 ) Danish Data Protection Agency ( I-suite number 04849 ) .
