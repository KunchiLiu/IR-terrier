Participants randomize one two condition : 1 ) treatment ZON computerize psychotherapy platform call Take Control ( TC ) ; 2 ) treatment placebo ( PLC ) TC . To understand neurobiology behind ZON 's potential therapeutic effect AUD , fMRI use compare brain activity ZON+TC versus PLC+TC group participant perform alcohol emotional-word Stroop task , well alcohol relate cue task .</brief_summary>
