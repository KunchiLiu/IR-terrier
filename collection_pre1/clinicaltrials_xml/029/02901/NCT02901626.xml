	<brief_title>A Randomized Trial Pessary Singleton Pregnancies With Short Cervix</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While cervical length one powerful predictor subsequent preterm birth , best treatment reduce subsequent preterm birth remain unknown . This study randomize trial woman singleton pregnancy short cervical length transvaginal ultrasound determine study-certified sonographer . It conduct 12 clinical center across country recruitment target enrollment 850 pregnant woman . Participants randomize 1 ) Arabin pessary 2 ) usual care per local hospital protocol . Pessary promising low-cost , non-surgical intervention appear well-tolerated . The pessary place obstetric provider train appropriate placement Arabin pessary . The primary outcome study delivery fetal death prior 37 week 0 day gestational age . In literature , two large trial produce conflict result ( M Goya et al , 2012 , K Nicolaides et al , 2016 ) . Thus , result adequately power appropriately conduct trial United States important determine whether pessary useful intervention prevention subsequent preterm birth woman singleton gestation .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Singleton gestation . Twin gestation reduce singleton either spontaneously therapeutically , eligible unless reduction occur 13 week 6 day project gestational age . Higher order multifetal gestation reduce singleton eligible . Gestational age randomization 16 week 0 day 23 week 6 day base clinical information evaluation early ultrasound . Cervical length transvaginal examination less equal 20 mm within 10 day prior randomization study certify sonographer . There low cervical length threshold . Cervical dilation ( internal o ) 2 cm great digital examination evidence prolapse membrane beyond external cervical o either time qualify cervical ultrasound examination cervical exam immediately randomization . Fetal anomaly imminent fetal demise . This include lethal anomaly , anomaly may lead early delivery increase risk neonatal death e.g. , gastroschisis , spina bifida , serious karyotypic abnormality . An ultrasound examination 14 week 0 day 23 week 6 day project Estimated Date Confinement ( EDC ) must perform prior randomization evaluate fetus anomaly . Previous spontaneous preterm birth 16 week 0 day 36 week 6 day . This include induction pPROM prior pregnancy . Planned treatment intramuscular 17Î± hydroxyprogesterone caproate . Placenta previa , risk bleed high potential indicate preterm birth . A low lying placenta acceptable . Active vaginal bleeding great spotting time randomization , potential exacerbation due pessary placement . Symptomatic , untreated vaginal cervical infection potential exacerbation due pessary placement . Patients may treat subsequently asymptomatic , randomize . However , 10 day since cervical length measurement , new cervical length measurement must obtain . Active , unhealed herpetic lesion labium minora , vagina , cervix due potential significant patient discomfort increase genital tract viral spread . Once lesion ( ) heal patient asymptomatic , may randomize . History herpes exclusion . Rupture membrane due likelihood pregnancy loss preterm delivery well risk ascend infection could increase pessary placement . More six contraction per hour report documented prior randomization . It necessary place patient tocodynamometer . Known major Mullerian anomaly uterus ( specifically bicornuate , unicornuate , uterine septum resect ) due increase risk preterm delivery unlikely affect progesterone . Any fetal/maternal condition would require invasive inutero assessment treatment , example significant red cell antigen sensitization neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia . Major maternal medical illness associate increase risk adverse pregnancy outcome indicate preterm birth ( treat hypertension require one agent , treatment diabetes prior pregnancy , chronic renal insufficiency define creatinine &gt; 1.4 mg/dL , carcinoma breast , condition treat chronic oral glucocorticoid therapy ) . Lupus , uncontrolled thyroid disease , New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) stage II great cardiac disease also exclude . Patients seizure disorder , HIV , medical condition specifically associate increase risk indicate preterm birth exclude . Prior cervical cone/LOOP/Loop Electrocautery Excision Procedure ( LEEP ) exclusion criterion . Planned cerclage cerclage already place since would preclude placement pessary . Planned indicated delivery prior 37 week . Allergy silicone . Participation another interventional study influence gestational age delivery neonatal morbidity mortality . Participation trial previous pregnancy . Patients screen previous pregnancy , randomize , may include . Prenatal care delivery plan elsewhere unless study visit make schedule complete outcome information obtain .</criteria>
