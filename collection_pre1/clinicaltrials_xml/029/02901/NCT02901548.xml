Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 01 . Adequate organ marrow function . Written inform consent locally require authorization ( e.g. , HIPAA USA , EU Data Privacy Directive EU ) obtain subject prior performing protocolrelated procedure , include screen evaluation . Females must pregnant , breast feed must negative urine serum pregnancy test within 28 day prior treatment day 1 . Females childbearing potential sexually active nonsterilized male partner must use highly effective method contraception time screening , must agree continue use precaution 90 day final dose Durvalumab . They must also refrain egg cell donation 90 day final dose Durvalumab . Nonsterilized male sexually active female partner childbearing potential must use highly effective method contraception refrain sperm donation Day 1 90 day receipt final dose Durvalumab . Muscle invasive ( T2 ) urothelial carcinoma urothelial carcinoma outside bladder . Involvement plan and/or conduct study ( applies AstraZeneca staff and/or staff study site ) previous enrolment present study . Any previous treatment PD1 PDL1 inhibitor , include durvalumab . History another primary malignancy except : Malignancy treat curative intent know active disease ≥5 year first dose study drug low potential risk recurrence ; Adequately treat nonmelanoma skin cancer lentigo maligna without evidence disease ; Adequately treat carcinoma situ without evidence disease e.g. , cervical cancer situ . Receipt last dose anticancer therapy ( chemotherapy , immunotherapy , endocrine therapy , tyrosine kinase inhibitor , biologic therapy , tumor embolization , monoclonal antibody , investigational agent ) ≤ 30 day prior first dose study drug within 6 week nitrosourea , mitomycin C intravesical therapy ) . Mean QT interval correct heart rate ( QTc ) ≥470 m calculate 3 electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) use Frediricia 's Correction . Current prior use immunosuppressive medication within 28 day first dose durvalumab , exception intranasal inhaled corticosteroid systemic corticosteroid physiological dos , exceed 10 mg/day prednisone , equivalent corticosteroid . Any unresolved toxicity ( CTCAE grade 2 ) previous anticancer therapy . [ Potential participant irreversible toxicity reasonably expect exacerbated investigational product may include ( e.g. , hear loss , peripherally neuropathy ) ] . Any prior Grade ≥3 immunerelated adverse event ( irAE ) receive previous immunotherapy agent , unresolved irAE &gt; Grade 1 . Active prior document autoimmune disease within past 2 year .
