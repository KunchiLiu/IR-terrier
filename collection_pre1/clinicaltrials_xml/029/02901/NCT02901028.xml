	<brief_summary>Significant morbidity , mortality , related cost cause traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) . A simple , effective , lightweight device worn athletes war fighter field , design mitigate TBI result blast trauma concussive event , would save life , huge cost currently experience life-treatment surviving victim . An externally-worn medical device applies mild jugular compression accord principle Queckenstedt Maneuver . PURPOSE : To monitor change vital sign , blood physiology , oxygen consumption , biomechanics , strength , neurological capability , balance population athlete wear Device . Secondly , determine tolerance acceptance Device undergo exertion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Innovative Concussion Prevention Device</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Device promise provide novel mechanism reduce prevent likelihood TBI , may use conjunction protective equipment . TBI lead cause death individual age 45 . The cost TBI U.S. estimate anywhere $ 50 $ 150 billion , annually . The January , 2008 New England Journal Medicine report , `` Head neck injury , include severe brain trauma , report one quarter service member evacuate Iraq Afghanistan '' [ 1-3 ] . The vast majority injury result exposure improvise explosive device ( IED ) blast wave . Head injury , concussion result trauma public discussion recently National Football League ( NFL ) deal lawsuit regard head injury one-third live former NFL player also concern athlete participate wide range sport , include hockey , rugby soccer . According NASA , `` The oscillation fluid cause external force , call sloshing , occur move vehicle contain liquid mass , truck , etc . '' This oscillation occur vessel partially fill . Similarly , brain face slosh peril external force impartation . Slosh permit external energy absorb content partially fill vessel container mean inelastic collision . Tissues differ density decelerate different rate create shear cavitation . If collision object molecule elastic , transfer energy object diminishes , minimize energy impart slosh . Woodpeckers , head ram sheep mammal ( include mankind ) small , little know misunderstood muscle neck call omo-hyoid muscle . Highly G-tolerant creature forest utilized muscle gently restrict outflow internal jugular vein thereby `` take '' excess compliance cranial space ultimately protect TBI like tiny `` airbags '' motor vehicle . This study utilize randomize cross study design . Subjects visit Human Performance Laboratory two separate occasion perform test procedure list table . During one test session , subject perform testing procedure wear Device investigation test session complete subject wear sham arm device , place upper arm cause venous engorgement . The order test session randomize prior subject 's arrival first session . The Device standard hockey neck guard , adapt purpose study . The Device incorporate two bulge localize site internal jugular vein bilaterally . Experiments perform jugular Doppler ultrasound demonstrate wearing Device , flow within jugular vein reduce , flow within carotid artery portion cerebrum preserve ( JA Fisher , unpublished data ) . Thus , application Device subject cause untoward health risk . The pressure exert Device region neck superficial internal jugular vein akin pressure felt person yawn wear snugly fitting necktie .</detailed_description>
