	<brief_summary>Aim : Exercise training improve risk cardiometabolic disease ; yet underlie mechanism unclear . Exercise induces release IL-6 skeletal muscle . Acute elevation IL-6 improve lipid glucose metabolism , latter partly delay gastric emptying . Physical inactivity cause accumulation visceral fat ( VAT ) . Visceral epicardial adipose tissue ( EAT ) inflame subcutaneous adipose tissue . Thus , investigator hypothesize exercise-induced IL-6 mediates exercise-induced reduction EAT VAT . Secondly , investigator hypothesize exercise-induced adaptation glucose metabolism gastric motility dependent IL-6 . Finally investigator hypothesise endurance resistance exercise training reduce VAT EAT . Primary aim : To investigate effect exercise train VAT determine extend IL-6 mediates effect . Secondary aim : 1 ) To determine whether 12 week endurance strength training reduce amount EAT . 2 ) To study whether effect exercise glucose metabolism gastric empty dependent IL-6 . Methods : Inclusion : 70 inactive men woman , &gt; 18 year , waist height ratio &gt; 0.5 and/or waist circumference ≥ 88 cm ( woman ) ; waist circumference ≥ 102 cm ( men ) Design : A 12-week , double-blinded randomise , placebo-controlled exercise intervention study . Intervention : Subjects randomise one five group : ) Tocilizumab ( IL-6 receptor antibody ) endurance training , ii ) Placebo Tocilizumab endurance training , iii ) Tocilizumab , exercise iv ) Placebo Tocilizumab training , v ) Placebo Tocilizumab , resistance training . Tocilizumab/placebo dose administer ( accord standard recommendation ) first train session , maintain 12-week training program . Training supervised ensure intensity compliance . Subjects instructed change eat habit inform study aim weight loss . Statistical consideration : Study investigator blind treatment allocation . Dropouts replace . A sample size 70 subject need detect 10 % change visceral adipose , power 80 % significance level 0.05 .</brief_summary>
