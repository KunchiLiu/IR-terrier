	<detailed_description>The investigator study effect right cerebellar transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) stimulation language therapy name individual chronic aphasia ( &gt; 6 month post stroke ) . Naming difficulty persistent common symptom aphasia left-hemisphere ( LH ) stroke . Although intervention improve name benefit , massive number treatment session usually require show gain , particularly individual chronic , large LH stroke . tDCS promise adjunct traditional language therapy . tDCS safe , non-invasive , non-painful electrical stimulation brain modulate cortical excitability application weak electrical current form direct current brain polarization . It usually administer via saline-soaked surface sponge electrode attach scalp connect direct current stimulator low intensity . Prior investigator mainly focus role LH language recovery , wherein electrode place left frontal temporal region . However , individual large lesion involve key language area like frontal temporal cortex , may difficult find viable tissue stimulate LH . This study use novel electrode placement chronic stroke patient aphasia large LH lesion . Targeting intact right cerebellum allow possibility identify single target use across group people aphasia vary lesion site size LH . Evidence functional neuroimaging clinical study indicate right cerebellum important language cognitive function . The investigator utilize randomize , double-blind , sham control , within-subject crossover trial design . A random subset ( half ) participant assign `` anode '' group ( Group Anode ) half assign 'cathode ' group ( Group Cathode ) . Participants take part 2 intervention period 15 computerized name training session ( 3-5 session per week ) , either tDCS + name therapy sham+ name therapy , separate 2 month . Detailed language evaluation take place , immediately , 2 week 2 month post-intervention condition . The investigator test hypothesis anodal tDCS cathodal tDCS cerebellum computerize naming therapy associate great gain accuracy name picture , compare sham combine computerized naming therapy .</detailed_description>
