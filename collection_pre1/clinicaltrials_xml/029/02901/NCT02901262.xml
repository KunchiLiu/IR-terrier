	<brief_title>Continuous Quantified EEG NeuroIntensive Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Using web base tool , clinicians two study center review 24 hour record ( raw EEG data + derive qEEG variable ) . The intensivists evaluate : - symmetry , - sedation level , - seizures activity - artefact continuous cEEG/qEEG tracing . The tracing blindly review certified neurophysiologist ( use app ) . The neurophysiologist evaluation consider `` reference '' . The result evaluation compare ( intensivists vs. neurophysiologist ) order understand intensivists able adequately identify pathological finding . The study period : - formal training - formal training neurophysiologist order understand training able improve intensivists performance .</detailed_description>
