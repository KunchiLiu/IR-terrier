	<brief_title>Nivolumab Relapsed Pediatric Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Programmed cell death 1 ( PD-1 ) inhibitory receptor prevents immune activation . PD-1 blockade mediate reactivation immune mediate tumor kill leading tumor regression . Another mechanism tumor associate immune inactivation elevation rate T regulatory cell . This process may prevent treatment low dose cyclophosphamide . Objective : This study evaluate safety tolerability anti PD1 antibody Nivolumab combine immunomodulating treatment , pediatric patient relapsed/progressive solid tumor Method : Patients treat IV Nivolumab 3mg/kg 60 minute day 1 15 cycle 28 day . 1 . Dose find phase : 1 . Six patient accrue first cohort treat 1 month 2 . If adverse event &gt; grade 2 occur &gt; 2 patient , study medication dose reduce 25 % another cohort 6 patient accrue reduce dose . 3 . Dose find cohort accrue determination dose allow DLT 2 . Expansion phase 1 . Following dose determination patient accrue , final number 30 patient 2 . Cyclophosphamide dose 50 mg/dayx7days every 14 day ( one week one week ) start . immunophenotype do every 28 day dose cyclophosphamide elevate 25mg /day every month high ratio CD8/CD25FOXP3 cell reach every child 3 . All patient treat 1 year image proven disease progression . 3 . Required follow 1 . All patient undergo tumor bed imaging ( CT/MRI-based tumor location ) metastatic evaluation ( accord standar follow ) every 4 month 2 . Tumor response measure base RECIST criterion 3 . Toxicity assessment do accord CTCAE v. 4.03 c. Collateral study : 1 . Immunohistochemical analysis PD1 PDL1 do pretreatment paraffin embed tissue estimate 's ability predict response . 2 . Immune profile peripheral blood lymphocyte include CD3+ , CD4+ , CD8+ FOX P3+ cell 's correlation objective response therapy . 3 . Exome sequence tumor peripheral blood do every patient . Exome evaluate driver mutation immunologic genomic signature .</detailed_description>
