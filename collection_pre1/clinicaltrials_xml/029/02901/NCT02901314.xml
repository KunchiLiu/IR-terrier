	<detailed_description>Non-adherence heart failure ( HF ) plan care hospital discharge associate clinical outcome , include combine endpoint all-cause mortality rehospitalization decompensated HF . Most patient discharge complex set instruction include multiple medication ( differ mediation administration plan ) , sodium restrict diet , fluid management action ( daily weight monitoring case , fluid restriction ) , monitor sign symptom HF , activity exercise , return follow-up . At discharge , patient ( family ) may understand HF chronic . Improvement quality life may dependent patient ' acceptance HF chronic , irreversible condition require self-care monitoring behavior ( example , become stay physically active ) , even feel fine .

The purpose randomize , control study examine effect use novel MyROAD ( Recordable On-Demand Audio Discharge ) card , give patient discharge . The aims single-blind , placebo-controlled study examine effect record message replay post discharge ( deliver via MyROAD card ) ( 1 ) 45- , 90- , 180-day first occurrence ( 2 ) time first occurrence all-cause HF-related hospitalization , ED visit death/ cardiac transplantation/ventricular assist device , ( 3 ) 45-day quality life ( KCCQ ) , symptom ( investigator initiate tool ; use previous research ) , functional status ( DASI ) perceive adherence activity recommendation ( investigator initiate tool ; use previous research ) , ( 4 ) 7-day follow-up appointment healthcare provider assign discharge . A total 1066 patient ( 968 + 10 % attrition ) decompensated HF randomize either usual care usual care receive MyROAD card discharge .</detailed_description>
