	<brief_summary>Osteoarthritis ( OA ) prevalent disease associate significant morbidity one common cause joint pain . Characterized chronicity , slow progressive evolution . The overall prevalence symptomatic knee osteoarthritis estimate 3.8 % , peak prevalence population average age 50 year . The main objective intervention patient knee OA reduce pain improved functional capacity exercise widely recommend . The literature show lack clinical trial verify effect strengthen hip muscle patient knee osteoarthritis . Thus , aim study assess effect strengthen hip abductor muscle versus hip adductor muscle patient symptomatic OA knee .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Strengthening Hip Abductor Patients With Knee Osteoarthritis : Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The physical therapy session average duration one hour , often twice week six week . The exercise intensity monitor physiotherapist determine participant 's ability complete 10 repetition particular exercise difficulty execution perceive modified Borg scale ( CR-10 ) . The exercise perform load 60-80 % capacity , load increase 2 10 % patient perform 14 full repetition last series ( 76 ) . It set 30 second rest rep 2 minute set exercise . Both group perform prior heat exercise exercise bike 10 minute moderate intensity Borg scale . Then two stretch repetition hold 30 second muscle group : hamstring , quadriceps , abductor , adductor gastrocnemius . Manual therapy patellofemoral tibiofemoral joint hold completion stretching . Recent clinical guideline knee OA strongly recommend use strengthening exercise low limb , close kinetic chain open . Thus , perform strengthen exercise extension knee flexion open kinetic chain , squat step exercise sural triceps . For symptom control exercise CKC use numeric scale pain execution . The GABQ add hip abduction exercise lateral decubitus , exercise `` Clam '' pelvic elevation . Studies prior point exercise among high electromyographic activity gluteus medius muscle . The GADQ add adduction exercise hip lateral recumbency , bilateral adduction ball legs functional diagonal leg . The exercise carry load 60-80 % 1 repetition maximum 8-12 rep , 1-3 set 2-3 time week . All exercise perform without worsen pain intensity exercise control accord perceive exertion scale Borg .</detailed_description>
