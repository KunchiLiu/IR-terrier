	<detailed_description>History current related study Femoral neck fracture common fracture account 3.58 % fracture , easily occur elderly gradually increase incidence , predispose bone nonunion , greatly influence patient 's mental physical health . Bone nonunion easily occur femoral neck fracture anatomic position , biomechanical property local blood supply . The objective treatment femoral neck fracture patient age 65 year rapidly restore low limb function reduce complication cause long term bed rest . Surgery treatment femoral neck fracture elderly satisfactory option contributes recovery joint function , also decrease incidence complication . Several concern address process design internal fixation equipment selection clinical treatment protocol include minimize surgical trauma , shorten length surgery , promote functional recovery hip joint . Osteoporosis generally consider difficult problem solve surgery femoral neck fracture elderly patient . The key point internal fixation femoral neck fracture optimize bone space strengthen fracture bone trabecula , yield strong fixation biomechanically . Percutaneous internal fixation cannulate compression screw become preferred treatment method osteoporotic femoral neck fracture elderly patient short length surgery less blood loss , insufficient hold power use screw femoral neck lead strong fixation . Therefore , joint prosthesis recommend repair femoral neck fracture elderly patient . Implantation femoral stem treatment early proximal femoral neck fracture achieve confirm clinical efficacy , long-term therapeutic effect treatment osteoporotic fracture proximal femoral neck remain poorly understood patient avascular necrosis femoral head . Novelty study The investigator perform search PubMed , Web Science Wanfang Database August 2016 article regard artificial prosthesis treatment osteoporotic femoral neck fracture find majority previous report focus early femoral neck fracture patient generally follow 6 month . In study , first time investigate feasibility implantation cement femoral stem versus percutaneous internal fixation cannulate compression screw treatment osteoporotic femoral neck fracture elderly patient avascular necrosis femoral head necrosis 12 month follow observation term hip joint function , pain , histocompatibility biomaterial host tissue , postoperative complication . Data collection , management , analysis open access An electronic data capture ( EDC ) system use data collection management . All study data time record electronic case report form provide sponsor patient 's visit recheck unless outcome achieve immediately . Thus , record information reflect patient 's late outcomes . Information accuracy rechecked included patient follow . The electronic data capture system lock project manager alter . All information relate trial preserve Qinghai University Affiliated Hospital . The electronic data fully disclose professional statistician statistical analysis . Anonymized trial data publish http : www.figshare.com . Statistical analysis Normally distribute continuous variable express mean Â±SD non-normally distribute variable express median quartile . Categorical variable express count percentage . All data statistically analyze use SPSS 19.0 software ( IBM Corp. , Armonk , NU , USA ) . Two-samples t-test Mann-Whitney U test use comparison Harris hip score VAS score percutaneous internal fixation cannulate compression screw implantation femoral stem . The chi-square test Fisher 's exact test use comparison histocompatibility biomaterial host tissue . A level P &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant . Confidentiality Only necessary data limit study effectiveness safety percutaneous internal fixation cannulate compression screws/implantation femoral stem treatment osteoporotic femoral neck fracture elderly patient collect process . The privacy information regard patient safeguard data collection processing , relate law regulation abide follow : - The process data collection fair legal . - The objective data collection specialize , identified legal . - The collect data abundant , relative excessive study objective , data unrelated study objective collect . - The collect data accurate update necessary . - Consent regard data collection acquire data collection . - The collect data disclose non-authorized person unlawfully mistake , lose altered . During whole study period , sponsor person right read patient 's information disclose information . Advantages limitation study Advantages : This prospective , randomize control , open-label trial , evaluate feasibility percutaneous internal fixation cannulate compression screw implantation cement femoral stem treatment osteoporotic femoral neck fracture complicate avascular necrosis femoral head elderly patient evaluate safety efficacy two surgical method . In addition , scant information report biocompatibility implant host tissue patient osteoporotic femoral neck fracture elderly patient . Therefore , finding fill gap . Limitations : Quality life daily activity also important index use evaluate efficacy surgery . But study limit human material source , evaluation limit Short Form ( 36 ) Health Survey Barthel Index Activities Daily Living perform , consider future study .</detailed_description>
