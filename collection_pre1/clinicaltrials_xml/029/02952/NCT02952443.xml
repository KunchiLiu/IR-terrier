	<brief_summary>The objective study evaluate multi-component exercise intervention effective therapy reverse pre-frailty phenotype female age 65 old . Participants screen frailty phenotype use Cardiac Health Study - Frailty Index ( CHS ) ; Clinical Frailty Scale ( CFS ) ; measure self-paced normal walk speed . Participants undergo baseline evaluation determine frailty phenotype females meet pre-frailty criterion randomize one two group ; 1 ) Multi-component exercise program , 2 ) A control group receive monthly newsletter tip successful age . The exercise group participate multi-component exercise program emphasize resistance training also include aerobic , balance flexibility components 3 time week 45 60 minutes/session 16 consecutive week . The control group ask maintain normal daily-living habit duration 16-week study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Frailty term widely use denote multidimensional syndrome associate loss physical cognitive reserve capacity make individual vulnerable cumulative clinical health condition . The level frailty classify one three phenotype ( non-frail ; pre-frail , frail ) use Cardiac Health Study frailty index ( CHS ) . The CHS assess number physical deficit express individual . These deficit include ( unexplained weight loss , poor grip strength , feeling exhaustion , slow gait , low level physical activity ) . An individual exhibit 1-2 deficit physical function suggest pre-frail phenotype . The Canadian Study Health Aging 's Clinical Frailty Scale ( CFS ) classify old adult 's level frailty use 9-level scale , range `` Very fit '' ( level 1 ) `` Terminally ill '' ( level 9 ) . An individual consider vulnerable mildly frail fall level 4 5 CFS . Both assessment tool use assess frailty status . It become difficult restore physical health individual attain 3+ deficit CHS ≥ level 6 CFS . The purpose study determine pre-frail phenotype reverse participant pre-frail and/or vulnerable mildly frail use CHS CFS assessment tool respectively . Both assessment tool use inclusion criterion outcome measure within study . To confirm frailty status , gait speed evaluate 4-meter level walkway addition 2-meters either end , allow acceleration deceleration walk speed . A normal gait speed 1-1.5 meters/second associate person express pre-frailty phenotype . Females susceptible frailty ; therefore , investigation target females 65 year age old . Eligibility criterion include female ( 65+ year ) consider pre-frail CHS vulnerable mildly frail ( level 4-5 ) CFS , normal gait speed 1-1.5 meters/second . Individuals consider pre-frail highlight study believe demographic critical-point physical transition frailty phenotype . If pre-frail individual actively engage restorative exercise reclaim muscle strength balance , remain pre-frail continue regress toward frailty phenotype . Frailty multidimensional geriatric syndrome additional assessment tool use determine physical strength deficit within individual . Participants clear exercise participation use Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire - Plus ( PAR-Q+ ) clear exercise Certified Exercise Physiologist ( CEP ) . The CEP good standing Canadian Society Exercise Physiology train effectively screen participant multiple co-morbidities exercise prescribe appropriate exercise program participant . Participants unstable health condition advise seek physician approval re-entering study use PAR-Medx assessment form . Cognitive function assess use Montreal Cognitive Assessment ( MoCA ) tool ensure participant suffer non-observable cognitive impairment . Participants randomize , use table random number , either Exercise ( EX ) Control ( CON ) group . The EX group participate 16-week multi-component training intervention ( 3x per week , 45 60 minutes/session , moderate vigorous intensity ) include primarily resistance exercise , aerobic warm-up cool , include flexibility balance exercise throughout session ( Bray et al. , 2016 ) . The CON group ask maintain normal daily living habit duration ( 16 week ) . At conclusion 16-weeks exercise program make available CON group participant . The sample size goal 50 participant , 25 per group ( EX=25 , CON=25 ) determine based-upon previous research population . T-tests use analyze intergroup difference baseline post intervention . Analysis Variance ( ANOVA ) use analyze intragroup difference week 0 ( baseline ) , week 8 ( mid-point ) week 17 ( post intervention ) . Measures intragroup difference include frailty assessment measure ( CHS CFS ) , Short Physical Performance Battery ( SPPB ) protocol , isotonic muscle strength dominate arm leg use Biodex System 4Pro Dynamometer assess daily physical activity accumulation examine use Phone FITT questionnaire . The investigator hypothesize randomly enrol exercise intervention reverse frailty phenotype CHS index ( i.e . 'pre-frail ' become 'non-frail ' ) restore physical function low level ( &lt; 4 ) CFS ( i.e . 'vulnerable ' become 'managing well ' ) , control group unchanged regress frailty phenotype become frail , move along CFS toward great level frailty . This research provide support use multi-component exercise proactive approach restore physical independence quality life old adult .</detailed_description>
