	<detailed_description>Rationale : Persons epilepsy great risk incur accidental injury high mortality risk general population . Study Objective : To understand life experience disease risk associate epilepsy patient epilepsy , relatives patient epilepsy bereave families.The result study integrated educational therapeutic program regard risk related epilepsy . Study design : Qualitative study phenomenological approach semiopragmatic analysis . Three different group interview : bereaved family , patient epilepsy relatives patient epilepsy . Recrutement procedure : The identification bereave family base French sentinel network `` Réseau Sentinelle Mortalité Epilepsie '' ( RSME ) . This network initially establish French League Against Epilepsy ( LFCE ) leadership bereave family 2010 support French Foundation Epilepsy Research ( FFRE ) . The primary aim RSME detail cause circumstance epilepsy-related death France . Secondary objective evaluate expectation need bereave family create national database future research program . Epilepsy-related death report physician also bereave family . The interview propose moment . Moreover RSME include national network bereave family . The interview also propose participant network . Patients epilepsy recruit tertiary epilepsy unit , private neurologist general practitioner thank patient association . Patients live Languedoc Roussillon area refer epilepsy unit University Hospital Montpellier ( CHRU Montpellier ) preferentially invite participate interview . The interview also propose relative patient ( parent spouse/husband ) consent participate . The study could propose patient include PRERIES study ( Risk Factors Sudden Unexpected Death Epilepsy : A matched case-control study , coordinate coordination unit RSME ) . Method : The characteristic methodology base COREQ criterion ( consolidated criterion report qualitative research ) . A qualitative study phenomenological approach use . The aim approach collect participant 'life-experiences real personal situation . Semistructured interview in-depth question conducted psychologist receive specific patient-centered interview training . The interview topic guide use open question center participant ' personal experience.The topic guide use first group ( epileptic patient ) second group ( relatives group ) . However , third group ( bereaved family ) , interview guide adapt , look life experience death : focusing circumstance , particular event , behavior clinical sign could give alarm . This interview difficult frequent sense guilt require experienced qualitative interviewer.The phenomenological question ask temporal prospect.The first part , concern disclosure disease . The question invite participant relive moment , remember tell epilepsy happen : felt , think ? Behaviors risk epilepsy tell doctors.Secondly , participant invite describe current disease influence way life.The key topic guide focus epilepsy influence body , relation others relative , employment , lifestyle personal identity . The saturation point determine new information pertain matter research emerge . The interview conduct face face home , hospital place ( depend choice participant ) . The different condition interview conduct clearly identify include recording : time , place , position actor , context ( family presence , disturb environment ) . Interviews digitally record transcribed secretary . According comprehensive approach , category identify advance derive data . Other data collect : Sociodemographic data ( gender , age , current occupation , education level , leasure , physical activity , drive lifestyle ) collect questionnaire fill participant interview . Clinical characteristic ( duration epilepsy , age onset , syndrome etiology , seizure type , seizures frequency ) complete physicians charge patient . For bereaved family , cause death record . Data analysis : Sample size : In qualitative study , sample size determine previously . Patients relatives satisfy inclusion criterion invite study participation saturation point . The saturation point determine point collection data result uncover new information pertain topic investigation . We estimate approximately 30 interview would sufficient reach data saturation . Transcripts analysis : The analysis conduct use ground theory approach incorporate pragmatism Peirce . A semiopragmatic analysis accord CS Peirce 's theory ( semiopragmatical approach ) guarantee clearly precise analysis limit bias error interpretation . So , conceptual category identify advance derive data constant comparison . Transcripts analyze two qualitative methodologists follow step : Transcribing recording word word ( verbatim ) , Floating reading focus reading , Breaking text unit mean theme , Identifing semiotic , textual contextual element let category emerge constant comparison ( empirical category ) , Characterizing empirical category obtain accord theory class Signs ( semiotics ) ( Quality , Fact , Law ) , Setting category hierarchical order accord relationship law presuppose fact presuppose quality , econstructing mean form synthetic generalizing proposition restore meaning study phenomenon Verbatim extract present illustrate obtain category number order identify anonymously . Descriptive analysis : Descriptive statistic sociodemographic clinical characteristic perform use SAS® version 9.1 . ( SAS Institute , Cary , NC ) . Intergroup difference examine use chi-squared Mann-Whitney U analyse . Practical course Study procedures visit Informed consent procedure : The participant participant 's parent ( ) / legal representative ( ) must inform interviewer aspect study relevant decide participate particular concern personal data collection , must sufficient time opportunity ask question . Prior interview , write Informed Consent form must sign personally date participant participant 's parent ( ) / legal representative ( ) . Collection data : This interview conduct psychologist use interview topic guide standardize form sociodemographic data clinical data .</detailed_description>
