	<detailed_description>The research procedure conduct University Kentucky A.B . Chandler Hospital dedicate bronchoscopy suite locate third floor Pavilion H module room # 2 , perform part standard care bronchoscopy procedure schedule participant pulmonary physician . This entire study ( biopsy ) add 10 minute less . Following biopsy , discharge hospital , participant 's study participation end . Bronchial Biopsy : The investigator collect five lung ( bronchial ) specimen ( 1-2 cubic millimeter ) three zone participant 's airway individually cod , store computer image analysis TRPV1 investigator 's laboratory . Following analysis sample destroy . The result analysis use determine clinical diagnosis . Therefore , investigator provide finding either participant physician . Participants get personal benefit take part study . Their willingness take part research study , may , future help doctor well understand and/or treat patient asthma . There cost participant bronchial biopsy perform . Participants receive reward payment take part study .</detailed_description>
