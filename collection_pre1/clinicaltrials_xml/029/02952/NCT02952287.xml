	<brief_title>Assessment Flow With New Four-dimensional Velocity-encoded Magnetic Resonance Imaging Technique</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Measurement blood flow vessel lead arise heart one key feature Cardiac Magnetic Resonance ( CMR ) . With standard 2D phase contrast ( PC ) flow measurement , vessel measure separately predefined location . Planning scanning time consume patient inside scanner . In addition , scan time long , hemodynamics may assess different physiological state . In contrast 2D PC acquisition 4D PC capture information blood flow velocity within 3D anatomical volume . Once predefined volume acquire , flow within heart vessel interest measure desire location offline , i.e . patient leave scanner . This especially advantageous case multiple 2D PC MRI scan need congenital heart disease ( CHD ) . In addition standard measurement , 4D PC provide flow pattern , might change current understanding pathologic flow condition . Although increase interest new technique , paper prove accuracy adult population . The purpose study validate accuracy 4D PC flow method quantification thoracic upper abdominal blood flow volume child . In validation study , 4D PC flow method apply 100 pediatric patient undergo clinically indicate CMR 2D PC flow measurement .</detailed_description>
