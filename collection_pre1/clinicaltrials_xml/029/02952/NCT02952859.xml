	<brief_summary>Pancreatic cancer fourth lead cause cancer death overall second colon rectum cancer among gastrointestinal cancer Western country . In Switzerland , 1,172 new pancreatic cancer patient diagnosed 2012 . Unfortunately , 20 % pancreatic cancer patient present disease state allow surgical resection 30 % locally advanced , unresectable disease 50 % show distant metastasis . While latter two currently treat palliative setting median survival 6-12 month , patient undergo tumor resection curative intention also achieve 5-year survival rate 20-25 % best hand . The reason poor outcome thought chemoresistance , early establishment metastatic disease , importantly , high rate R1 resection . Up 80 % pancreatic resection positive resection margin often find within vascular groove and/or retroperitoneal margin , close superior mesenteric artery . This high rate positive margin find meticulous pathological work-up normally detect standard assessment specimen . However , clinical importance high positivity resection margin even highlight patient undergoing portal vein resection despite negativity portal vein invasion regular pathological work-up show significantly well survival compare patient without portal vein resection . In sum , give overall poor prognosis despite tumor resection , auxiliary treatment strategy improve long-term outcome desperately need . Over last 5 year , irreversible electroporation ( IRE ) emerge non-thermal ablative modality allow local tumor destruction spar vital structure like artery , venous vessel , well bile pancreatic duct . There increase evidence IRE locally unresectable pancreatic cancer effective increase local progression free survival , distant progression free survival overall survival compare historic controls.Data margin accentuation IRE sparse recent study publish Martin et al show margin accentuation among patient borderline resectable disease perform safe efficacious treatment perform `` high degree technical ability skill set '' .</brief_summary>
