	<brief_title>`` Remind-to-move '' Promoting Upper Extremity Recovery Patients With Stroke After Subacute Discharge</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This proof-of-principle study investigate effect `` Remind-to-Move '' ( RTM ) use wearable device home promote upper extremity recovery stroke patient discharge subacute hospital . A multi-center , parallel-group , randomize control trial blind assessment carry four hospital . Eighty-four eligible participant suffer stroke less 6 month could slightly move arm randomly allocate either experimental , sham , control group stratify hemiplegic arm functional level . Patients experimental group treat RTM use wearable device , 3 consecutive hour daily , 4 week . The sham group use sham device . The control group receive usual care . A masked assessor evaluate participant 0 , 4th , 8th 12th week . Outcome measure include arm function test , motor activity log , movement amount percentage record wearable device . All patient allocate treatment include intention-to-treat analysis .</detailed_description>
