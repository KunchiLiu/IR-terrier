	<brief_summary>This study design assess effect Alveolar Ridge Preservation ( ARP ) tooth extraction compare extraction alone posterior maxilla . The result study demonstrate use ARP reduce alveolar ridge resorption 6 month post extraction posterior maxilla region .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Alveolar Ridge Preservation After Tooth Extraction Posterior Maxilla</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fifteen subject require extraction one posterior tooth right maxilla one posterior tooth leave maxilla consider enrollment . Subjects meet inclusion exclusion criterion randomize receive alveolar ridge preservation one side maxilla extraction side maxilla . Extraction fail teeth perform atraumatically ; mucoperiosteal flap employ . After removal tooth , alveolus meticulously debrided clean . In test site , socket fill xenograft collagen membrane . In control site , graft material collagen membrane use . Clinical measurement , standardize peri-apical radiograph Cone Beam Computed Tomography scan perform immediately follow tooth extraction ( visit 2 ) 6 month ( visit 4 ) extraction . Subjects examine course 6 month . Investigators train prior participate study . Training undertaken site initiation visit include detailed description study procedure include treatment method , measurement method obtain study endpoint .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1 . Subjects must voluntarily sign informed consent form . 2 . Subjects must male female least 2070 year age . 3 . Subjects must able willing follow study procedure instruction . 4 . Presence one posterior tooth right maxilla one posterior tooth leave maxilla require extraction ( ADA tooth position 24 1315 ) . The type tooth booth side , either two molar two premolar . 5 . Teeth extractions one posterior tooth right maxilla one posterior tooth leave maxilla must complete successfully ( ADA tooth position 24 1315 ) . 6 . If present , teeth adjacent teeth slat extraction must healthy . Healthy teeth define asymptomatic teeth without periapical lesion . 1 . Female subject pregnant lactating , intend become pregnant study period follow entrance study . 2 . Subjects fail maintain good plaque control . 3 . Subjects systemic condition uncontrolled diabetes mellitus , cancer , HIV , disorder compromise wound healing , chronic high dose steroid therapy , intravenous oral bisphosphonate therapy , bone metabolic disease , history irradiation head neck area , immunosuppressive therapy would contraindicate oral surgical treatment . 4 . Subjects report allergy hypersensitivity product ( collagen membrane ABBM ) use throughout study . 5 . Presence â‰¥3 mm vertical loss buccal bone relation palatal wall . 6 . Subjects untreated periodontitis . 7 . Presence acute dentoalveolar infection teeth slat extraction . 8 . Subjects heavy smoker ( define &gt; 10 cigarette per day &gt; 1 cigar per day ) chew tobacco , include within 3 month prior enrollment . 9 . Subjects condition circumstance , opinion investigator , would prevent completion study participation interfere analysis study result , history non compliance unreliability</criteria>
