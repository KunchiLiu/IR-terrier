Thus , reduce OASIS preserve maternal fetal outcome important goal clinical obstetrics . At two TriHealth tertiary care institution , overall rate OASIS 3.5 % . This comparable , superior , publish rate center . In fact , literature quite variable , report incidence range 0.25-6 % . Indeed , TriHealth recently set task force reduce injury part recent endeavor quality improvement . Prevention first step improve complication . This study seek decrease incidence obstetric anal sphincter injury may occur birth process bring notable physician review technique obstetrics resident help avoid injury observe delivery woman enrol .</detailed_description>
