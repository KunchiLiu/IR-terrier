	<brief_summary>The project seek develop effective computer-delivered brief intervention reduce alcohol use use Multiphase Optimization Strategy ( MOST ) . Sixteen different version intervention test manipulation common factor ( empathy &amp; positive regard ) , use voice , use animate narrator . Participants include 352 undergraduate student randomly assign one intervention condition ; follow-up assessment take place one 3 month . The main outcome mean drink per day past 30 day .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The propose project seek develop maximally effective computer-delivered brief intervention ( CDBI ) reduce heavy alcohol use . To accomplish , use Multiphase Optimization Strategy ( MOST ) , efficient method optimize intervention content , begin factorial design evaluate main interaction effect specific intervention component . Our selection component guide : ( ) Common Factors Theory , highlight tremendous contribution non-specific factor , empathy positive regard , therapy outcome , unknown relevance CDBIs ; ( b ) Media Equation Theory , suggest people automatically respond computer social way , particularly computer replicate human characteristic . To accomplish goal , examine outcomes computer-delivered brief intervention common factor ( empathy &amp; positive regard ) , use voice , use animate narrator systematically manipulate use factorial design . We also systematically manipulate presence vs. absence motivational content order examine possible interaction common factor specific motivational technique . Participants 352 undergraduate randomly assign 1 16 intervention condition . Mean drink per day past 30 day measure 1 3-month follow-up . Secondary analysis also examine past month heavy drinking day , alcohol-related consequence , intention reduce alcohol use . We hypothesize significant main effect ( 1 ) factor consistent Common Factors Theory ( empathy positive regard ) , ( 2 ) two factor consistent Media Equation Theory ( voice narrator ) , ( 3 ) presence motivational content . We hypothesize mean drinks/day low ( 1 ) common factor ( empathy , positive regard ) combine voice and/or narrator ( 2 ) motivational content combine common factor and/or voice/narrator .</detailed_description>
