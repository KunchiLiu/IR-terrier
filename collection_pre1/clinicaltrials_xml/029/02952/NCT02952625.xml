	<brief_summary>This pilot non-intervention study aim introduce PET/MRI , state art new imaging technique , radiotherapy treatment pathway patient head neck cancer . Ultimately investigators aim establish appropriate scanning image registration protocol , allow progression randomize trial adaptive radiotherapy dose escalation . The latter thought potentially improve outcome group . Ten patient squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) oropharynx , hypopharynx larynx , plan radical treatment radiotherapy ( +/-chemotherapy ) , recruit . Study participant two PET/MRI scan , radiotherapy immobilization device situ . The first do prior start radiotherapy , second half way treatment . Image quality assess compare standard diagnostic scan different registration method compare establish best way incorporate PET/MR image data radiotherapy planning system . Patient tolerability workflow consideration also qualitatively assess . Furthermore , plan study conduct establish relevant treatment protocol subsequent dose escalation trial . PET/MRI excite new technology lot potential context adaptive radiotherapy dose escalation . Within pilot study investigator aim address technical challenge use context prior proceed randomized trial .</brief_summary>
