	<brief_summary>This Phase 1b trial open label , multi-center study XMT-1522 administer intravenous infusion every three week . The dose escalation part study establish maximum tolerate dose recommended Phase 2 dose patient advance breast cancer HER2 immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) score least 1+ use validate IHC assay . Upon completion dose escalation , cohort expansion segment study consist four parallel cohort different patient group confirm maximum tolerate dose recommend Phase 2 dose estimate objective response patient population .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The dose escalation segment study utilize 3+3 design . Initially , 3 patient dose dose level . The first 3-week cycle treatment constitutes dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) evaluation period . If none 3 patient experience DLT evaluation period Safety Review Committee agree reasonably well tolerate dose , 3 patient enrol next dose level . However , event 1 DLT , 3 additional patient enrol dose level . Any dose level 2 DLTs consider exceeded maximum tolerate dose subsequent patient enrol low dose level . After first cycle , patient may continue receive XMT-1522 disease progression long drug well-tolerated patient continue derive clinical benefit opinion Investigator . After completion dose escalation , expansion segment enroll patient follow kind cancer : - Cohort 1 : Advanced breast cancer , HER2 IHC 1+ , HER2 IHC 2+ without HER2 gene amplification - Cohort 2 : Advanced breast cancer , HER2-positive , receive prior ado-trastuzumab emtansine - Cohort 3 : Advanced gastric cancer , HER2-positive , receive prior trastuzumab - Cohort 4 : Advanced non-small cell lung cancer , HER2 IHC 2+ 3+ , HER2 gene amplification mutation status</detailed_description>
