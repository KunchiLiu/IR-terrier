	<brief_title>Study Primary Fascial Closure Rate Patients With Open Abdomen Treated With Abthera Versus Barker Technique</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study do compare two different Temporary Abdominal Closure method could use case open abdomen . The method compare Barker 's vacuum packing technique ( BVPT ) Open Abdomen Negative Pressure Therapy System ( ABThera ) . The BVPT make internal plastic layer cover abdominal viscera , second layer surgical sponge suction drain cover adhesive plastic layer . Then dress connect hospital 's vacuum system . The ABThera dressing available commercially . Study Participants Enrollment happen operating room Investigator include study patient follow indication laparostomy : - Damage control surgery trauma patient , - Patients abdominal compartment syndrome , - Septic shock patient require short surgery inability close abdominal cavity . Signing consent form hold order preference : 1 . Patient 2 . Legal representative 3 . Doctor appoint hospital participate study ( case urgency surgery allow contact representative ) . In latter case signature term apply legal representative soon possible . Criteria inclusion exclusion : Inclusion : • Patients indication open abdomen According Attending physician ( criterion ) Exclusion : - Pregnancy ; - Chronic renal impairment , - Child-Pugh C , - Body index 40 kg / m2 , - Uncontrolled bleed laparotomy - Patients progress death within first 48 hour Allocation Concealment Randomization Randomization perform central online dedicate site ratio 1 : 1 . When patient eligible , surgeon access Web site , enter patient 's information know assign allocation . Variable block size randomization utilize stratified study center Assuming closure rate 75 % Abthera arm 35 % Control arm , study 36 patient treatment arm ( 72 total ) would 90 % power detect difference 0.05 significance level . In order evaluate closure 36 patient arm , estimate loss 30 % either withdraw death prior 48h . So study enroll 94 patient ( 47 treatment group ) After surgery , patient refer intensive care unit ( ICU ) . In patient ' Barker Group fenestrated plastic use contact viscera follow four pad suction drain adhesive finishing layer . In ABThera group technique dress do accord description manufacturer 's instruction ( Acelity , San Antonio , TX ) . Primary Objective : • Fascial closure 30 day Secondary objectives - Demographic variable ( gender , age , comorbidities , mechanism injury disease ) , - Indication laparostomy , - Systolic blood pressure , - Amount fluid drain heal laparostomy , - Amount crystalloid , - Amount hemoconcentrated , - APACHE II ICU admission , - Length stay ICU , - Length mechanical ventilation , - Length hospital stay , - Time closure - Adverse Events - Complications - Mortality . In trauma patient score Revised Trauma ( RTS ) Injury Severity Score ( ISS ) calculate Statistical analysis Descriptive variable summarize frequency percentage . Continuous variable data present mean standard deviation median range , depend distribution . The analysis qualitative variable do measure association ( chi-square Fisher 's exact test ) . The analysis quantitative variable make mean different test ( parametric nonparametric ) depend outcome apply normality test</detailed_description>
