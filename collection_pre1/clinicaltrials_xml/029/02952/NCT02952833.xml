	<detailed_description>This study single-center , double-blinded , placebo-controlled , Phase 1 , dose de-escalation study evaluate safety , reactogenicity , immunogenicity ZPIV administer homologous prime-boost regimen Flavivirus-naïve healthy male non-pregnant female adult subject . Three dose level may evaluate . Each subject receive either placebo 5.0 mcg ( high dose [ HD ] ) , 2.5 mcg ( moderate dose [ MD ] ) , 1.25 mcg ( low dose [ LD ] ) ZPIV administer intramuscular ( IM ) injection Days 1 29 . The study consist screen period 28 day , vaccination period subject receive prime dose vaccine Day 1 follow boost Day 29 , follow-up period 12 month post boost vaccination . The entire duration subject 's participation approximately 14 month include recruitment collection data safety reactogenicity study vaccine sample assessment immunogenicity . This study expect take approximately 30 month complete initiation availability final report primary outcome safety secondary outcomes humoral immunity ZIKV . The Primary objective study 1 . Assess safety reactogenicity homologous prime boost regimen ZPIV give three different dose level dose de-escalation format , 2 . Compare safety reactogenicity profile ZPIV vaccination dosage group . The secondary objective study 1 . Assess humoral immune response overall dosage group homologous prime-boost regimen ZPIV determine kinetics immune response , seroconversion rate , peak Geometric Mean Titer ( GMT ) 2 . Assess durability humoral immune response overall dosage group ZPIV 6 12 month second vaccine administration .</detailed_description>
