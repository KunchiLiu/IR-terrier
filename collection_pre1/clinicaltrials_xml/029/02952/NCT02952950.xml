	<brief_summary>In project 3 study examine two possible explanation one possible preventive intervention early cessation exclusively breastfeeding premature infant . Study 1 The content protein milk mother , delivers prematurely , third high milk mother delivers time . The nutritional composition change time content protein decrease . Therefore premature infant risk protein deficiency . While infant feed tube decrease content protein make add , difficult infant exclusively breastfeed . The hypothesis reduce protein content breast milk associate few number day premature infant exclusively breastfed . Study 2 The premature infant characterize immature muscle low tension therefore , low ability eat need breastfeed first period . The transfer milk mother child interaction mother milk ejection reflex establish positive pressure milk child establish vacuum . The hypothesis premature infant suction power weak establish sufficient intraoral vacuum ensure milk transfer breast infant relate few number day infant exclusively breastfed . Study 3 The premature infant low muscle tone immaturity also influence organization quality movement , mark neuro motor process . These process form oral motor base support movement involve infant ability establish vacuum . The hypothesis Oral Stimulation specific program 5 minute minimum 2 meal per . day least 14 day increase preterm infant 's ability create intra oral vacuum thus power transfer milk breast , thereby extend number day infant exclusively breastfed . 200 infant include consecutively , recur cohort 3 study .

	<detailed_description>The purpose project , consist 3 study , investigate whether insufficient protein breastmilk / inadequate intra oral vacuum infant explain early breastfeeding cessation premature infant . Furthermore test whether breastfeed period may extend oral stimulation . The rate breastfeeding mother infant bear prematurely low mother give birth time . A Danish survey show 70 % premature exclusive breastfeed discharge rate decrease 30 % six week discharge . Breastmilk healthy nutrition newborn base WHO 's strategy feeding infant Board Health recommend newborn infant , include premature , far possible exclusively breastfed six month . Exclusively breastfeed mean infant get breastmilk mother . Exclusively breastfeed health implication mother infant . Breastfeeding reduce lactation incidence infectious disease , improves cognitive development visual function infant reduces risk develop later obesity . In addition , level immune protective factor anti-inflammatory element high mother 's milk preterm infant therefore reduce infant 's increase risk early severe infection , death late effect . Furthermore , breastfeed may reduce risk premature infant 's abnormal vessel growth eye , appear protective effect disease significant excess mortality primarily attack intestines preterm infant ( necrotizing enterocolitis ) . Problem Area / factor milk composition importance breastfeed Breastmilk contains necessary nutritional component energy infant need . Therefore , milk mother deliver early higher content fat protein , thereby high level energy compare milk mother give birth term . The content protein milk mother give birth prematurely 12 gram per liter thus approximately one-third high mother give birth time . The nutritional composition breastmilk vary considerably time content protein decrease premature infant risk protein deficiency thereby insufficient growth . During hospital stay , infant feed tube decrease protein content make add , difficult infant breastfeed exclusively . Protein important infant 's growth strength local statement Hvidovre Hospital find 18 % hospitalized preterm infant 2014 add additional protein breastmilk , growth sufficient . The question whether reduce protein content breastmilk correlation number day preterm infant exclusively breastfed ? Problem Area / intra oral vacuum strength infant significance breastfeed The period birth premature infant feed exclusively breast without supplementary tube feed varies week month , depend early infant bear . The premature infant characterize immature low muscle tone therefore , decrease ability breastfeed first time . The transfer milk mother infant interaction mother milk ejection reflex create positive pressure milk infant create vacuum . If infant create vacuum back mouth , nipple mother push together infant transfer milk breast oral cavity . The amount milk regulate relation demand weak shortage vacuum cause shortage milk transfer , turn physiologically lead less milk production thereby decrease amount . Studies investigate process measure intra oral vacuum , show importance infant 's contribution milk transfer , answer extent premature infant ability create vacuum importance breastfeed establishment maintaining . The question whether premature infant suck strength weak establish sufficient intraoral vacuum ensure milk transfer breast infant relate few number day infant exclusively breastfed . In addition premature infant muscle tone immaturity also affect organization quality body movement . Organization quality movement may refer neuro motor process form among others oral motor base support movement involve infant 's ability create vacuum . The process precede creation vacuum study show early intervention oral stimulation form stimulation nerve muscle around mouth , oral motor basis strengthen . Studies infant carefully stimulate finger , show premature infant 's muscle suck reflex influence able suck large volume short time bottle compare infant stimulate orally . This present opportunity influence premature infant´s strength maybe increase ability create intra oral vacuum affect oral stimulation skill infant preserve . The question whether oral stimulation increase premature infant 's ability create vacuum thus increase power transfer milk breast thereby extend number day exclusively breastfed ? The 3 study base cohort . The cohort identify recruited Neonatal Intensive Care Unit Hvidovre Hospital relevant family mother delivers prematurely include consecutively accordance inclusion exclusion criterion . The cohort demographically representative everyday life clinical practice various family formation , education level socio-economic background condition . Power calculation base primary outcome : exclusively breastfeed duration make show effect exclusively breastfeed duration intervention- control group . Requirements power calculation mean value vacuum set 100 % standard deviation ( SD ) 26 % . To detect small clinically relevant difference 13 % , equivalent half SD expect drop 20 % , include 200 infant ( 100 infant group ) study ( alpha = 0.05 beta = 0.1 ) . There hospitalize annually average 300 preterm infant neonatal section . It expect 100 infant meet criterion inclusion , thus achieve approximately 2 year . By inclusion family anonymized allocate ID number . When multiple assign infant ID number one letter , b c. All data measurement obtain / make record far possible project manager alternatively project nurse . 6 week date expect terminator date either family visit Neonatal section project manager/project nurse visit family order status breastfeeding , vacuum measurement infant 's growth . In addition family contact telephone week infant 's postnatal age 6 month . Here record breastfeeding status , time termination exclusive breastfeeding infant 's weight GP visit 5 month old . The infant 's growth define naked weight , Length head circumference . Previous study show number factor affect breastfeed duration . Features concern socio-demographic background variable , perinatal psychosocial condition gather project manager project nurse use questionnaire interview family form data analyzes . Participation project safe associate risk discomfort either mother infant . STUDY 1 / PROTEIN IN BREASTMILK Data obtain human milk section hospital . Volume obtain milliliter ( ml . ) protein content gram pr . 100 ml . use Miris Human Milk Analyzer accord usual practice . Miri European equipment analyze human milk . The test sample 10 milliliter result give within minute log machine transfer project database . When mother exclusively breastfeed , ask 10 ml . Manual hand compress breast milk . The analyzed milk can´t reuse therefore destroy . STUDY 2 / WEEK STRENGTH ASSESSMENT BY VACUUM MEASUREMENT Sucking strength premature infant define ability create intra oral vacuum suck . The intra oral vacuum premature infant assess measure vacuum unit mBar primary make project manager blind know infant receive oral stimulation . The measurement make infant awake show readiness suck . For vacuum measurement manometer select bottle pacifier , fit Calmaflaske make firm Medela . The pacifier shape similar function breast extra small match premature mouth premature infant . As completely closed system suck infant register connected manometer . In order obtain measure reproducibility method vacuum measurement carry 3 consecutive measurement . The advantage 3 measurement within short time determine intra-individual variability , infant motivate show redlines measurement 3 time . The equipment develop cooperation Technical University Denmark . STUDY 3 / randomize INTERVENTION STUDY / ORAL STIMULATION Infants whose mother include cohort randomize receive / receive oral stimulation infant 's postnatal age least 32 + 0 week , time infant able coordinate suck swallow reflex . In multiple birth infant randomize group . The list generate block randomize block 10 Families randomize intervention group grant total one hour instruction program oral stimulation one two occupational therapist experience oral stimulation preterm infant . The program collaboration project team develop describe Department Physiology Occupational therapy Hvidovre Hospital . The first guidance parent duration approximately half hour follow-up twice , depend need family . To maintain consistent intervention time program oral stimulation write script , family also must record follow variable : date time oral stimulation . In occupational therapy guidance script examine sign infant exhibit ready / ready stimulation . The family also see movie sign program oral stimulation review auditory visual . Families control group see movie , receive script supervision occupational therapist infant get oral stimulation . Both group receive instruction usual practice i.e . guidance element promote breastfeed example , skin skin contact compression .</detailed_description>
