	<brief_summary>Acromegaly rare , chronic , debilitate disease , usually cause benign tumor pituitary gland , lead excessive production growth hormone ( GH ) . GH excess turn cause overproduction another hormone call insulin-like growth factor-1 ( IGF-1 ) . IGF-1 level currently widely accept measure disease activity . In Canada , medical therapy type medicine call `` somatostatin analogue '' ( SSA ) , octreotide lanreotide , recommend treatment acromegaly . However , study show significant number patient take SSA medication alone remain elevated level IGF-1 blood . Another medication use treat acromegaly pegvisomant ( PEGV ) , investigator plan study whether strict control IGF-1 , add optimize use PEGV , result significant health benefit patient still modestly high level IGF-1 blood .</brief_summary>
