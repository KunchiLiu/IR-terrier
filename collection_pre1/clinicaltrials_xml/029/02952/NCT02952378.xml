	<brief_summary>Treatment colloidal solution long time cornerstone within intensive care . Lately , doubt raise synthetic colloid , natural albumin use . One solution hyperoncotic `` Albumin 20 % '' . However still many aspect physiological effect hyperoncotic albumin , know . In study physiological effect study burn patient healthy subject . The colloid osmotic pressure increase plasma volume measure 15 healthy subject 15 burn patient . The effect plasma volume study use hemoglobin marker dilution . Colloids osmotic pressure albumin concentration measure directly urin production also measure . Blood sample collect 4 5 hour achieve profile change .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Volume Kinetics Hyperoncotic Albumin Burn Patients Well Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Healthy individual ask refrain eat drink night study . Two hour study start , subject may take sandwich glas drink . Patients also ask keep rule unless receive parenteral nutrition . Shortly study , subject ask leave urine sample . After 15 minute rest first bood sample take . An infusion 3 ml/kg bodyweight Albumin 20 % give 30 minute . The first hour study start ( start infusion ) blood sample take every 10 minute . The follow 4 hour another 9 blood sample collect . Hemoglobin , albumin colloidosmotic pressure measure every occasion . C-reactive protein , interleukin-6 , Syndecan -1 well heparan sulfate , measure , 1 hour 5 hour study start . The total volume blood collect 150 ml . If study subject low urin output , acetated Ringers give end study . Liberal fluid intake recommend day next .</detailed_description>
