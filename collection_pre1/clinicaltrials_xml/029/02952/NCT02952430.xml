	<brief_summary>Patients age 65 comprise half emergency general surgical workload , however , available risk-prediction tool patient extrapolate young cohort . Research suggest high pre-operative frailty score correlate increase post-operative mortality morbidity . Validated frailty assessment may help identify high risk older emergency surgical patient , facilitate decision-making informing patient choice . We propose first prospective UK observational study assess frailty independent predictor outcome old surgical patient undergo emergency laparotomy . Prospective data collection patient 65 undergoing emergency laparotomy perform 20 NHS Trusts . Pre-operative frailty score evaluate use Rockwood Frailty Scale . Primary outcome measure 30-day mortality . Secondary outcome measure post-operative complication , alter independence status length stay . Results disseminate national/international surgical meeting publish peer-reviewed journal .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Emergency Laparotomy Frailty Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The ELF steer committee run project part North West Research Collaborative ( NWRC ) , consist surgical trainee successful record publishing credible research establish clinical trial . Following ethical approval , data collect NHS Trusts throughout UK . Trained lead facilitate data collection adhere study protocol local clinical governance . Patients 65 undergoing emergency laparotomy identify prospectively 3 month . Demographics , time surgical intervention , length stay ( LOS ) , pre- post-admission independence , intermediate care stay , Clavien-Dindo post-operative complication , 30-day mortality 30-day re-admission data collect secure database . Pre-operative frailty assess use Rockwood Frailty Scale . 500 patient require statistically significant difference primary outcome ( 30 day mortality ) . Secondary outcome measure complication , change independence status LOS . Outcomes analyse compare impact frailty .</detailed_description>
