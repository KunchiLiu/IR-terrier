	<brief_summary>Inflammatory Bowel Disease ( IBD ) group inflammatory condition small bowel colon . Main type include Ulcerative Colitis Crohn 's Disease . Symptoms often difficult distinguish except location nature change . IBD complex arises interaction environmental , genetic factor , immunological response , chronic recur inflammation . Many factor appear contributory , single set issue appear explain process . Microbiota , intestinal wall granulation breach , dietary , genetic predisposition appear factor . Treatment often reactive suppressive medication , neither appear reverse disease process . This study explore value complex group adipose-derived stem/stromal cell ( AD-cSVF ) disease process .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use Autologous , Adult Adipose-Derived Stem/Stromal Cells Inflammatory Bowel Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>IBD often present clinically abdominal pain , diarrhea ( without blood ) , fever , weight loss , failure thrive , many relate symptom . Complications disorder may also include anemia , skin rash , arthritis , severe chronic fatigue , eye inflammatory change . It felt IBD disorder may cause combination environmental , immune , genetic , bacterial factor . Results issue produce chronic inflammatory disorder , immune system attack gastrointestinal tract , perhaps direct certain microbial antigen . The group appear pure autoimmune disease reaction , may relate immunodeficiency state . There medication surgical procedure know cure disease . Most aimed reduction symptom , maintain remission , try prevent relapse . Temporary anti-inflammatory medication may improve acute process , follow methotrexate thiopurine maintain remission state . Surgery appear important case perforation , abscess , obstruction , cancer management . Actual occurrence unknown , Crohn 's Disease Ulcerative Colitis appear relate . It estimate 35,000 death report 2010 . Crohn 's Disease alone appear affect 3.2 per 1000 people Europe North America alone . The usual onset symptom may appear actual diagnosis make , typical diagnosis occur 15-30 year age . Lead abdominal pain symptom ( usually low right quadrant ) recurrent period flare remission . Many dietary , bacterial , antimicrobial , environmental factor receive attention , new interest evaluate alternative therapeutic modality deal issue immune system . Use immune privilege cellular agent hold within AD-cSVF propose help inflammatory contributor well modulation inflammation favor chronic wound heal avascular system . Known provide secretory antibiotic ( ll-37 ) contribution , think pro- anti-microbials , may prove value area specifically . Cytokine growth factor implication lesion sit remain poorly understood , experience biocellular regenerative therapy experience contribution heal prevention recurrence ulcerative skin lesion . Harvest autologous adipose-derived tissue stromal vascular fraction ( AD-tSVF ) proven rich resource microvascular stem/stromal cell element well document growth factor cytokine contributor . With advent safe , measurable , efficacious reproducible number close isolation environment , ability isolate concentrate cell-only product . This AD-cSVF capable reintroduction patient , via Normal Saline Solution , via parenteral route . This study intend evaluate safety ( adverse outcome ) efficacy use autologous cellular therapy case IBD .</detailed_description>
