	<brief_summary>Although PD consider predominantly motor disease cause loss dopaminergic neuron , multiple study indicate cholinergic dysfunction already start early PD crucial development dementia addition motor symptoms.Because crucial role CNS function neurodegenerative disorder , include PD , great importance get good understand cholinergic functioning brain . Pathways acetylcholine synthesis , transport release provide possible target vivo image cholinergic system . However , previous approach consider indirect biomarkers cholinergic terminal integrity measure pre- post-synaptic expression . The novel vesicular acetylcholine transporter ( VAChT ) tracer [ 18F ] Fluoroethoxy-Benzovesamicol ( [ 18F ] FEOBV ) provide direct measurement presynaptic cholinergic function . The use [ 18F ] FEOBV Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) image marker cholinergic innervation , however , study healthy human volunteer data available patient . With study difference cholinergic function PD patient healthy aged-matched volunteer quantify . In addition test-retest variability determine</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessing Cholinergic Innervation Parkinson 's Disease Using PET Imaging Marker 18FFluoroethoxybenzovesamicol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Cholinergic neuron play important role neurotransmission within central nervous system ( CNS ) . They involve complex function like memory , learning , recognition , attention , consciousness , regulation sleep-wake cycle maintenance posture gait . Cholinergic neuron degeneration neocortex hippocampus CNS , important neurochemical change observe several neurodegenerative disease , include Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . Therefore , assessment vesicular acetylcholine transporter ( VAChT ) important molecular target cholinergic circuit , spark interest development radiotracers study target vivo . Preclinical study show VAChT tracer ( - ) -5- [ 18F ] Fluoroethoxybenzovesamicol ( [ 18F ] FEOBV ) potentially useful detect cholinergic lesion vivo . A previous [ 18F ] FEOBV PET study confirm tracer bind VAChT expect vivo human brain distribution . The use [ 18F ] FEOBV PET image marker cholinergic innervation , however , study healthy human volunteer data available patient . Objective : The main objective study evaluate difference [ 18F ] FEOBV binding PD patient healthy control subject , order evaluate clinical feasibility [ 18F ] FEOBV cholinergic image ligand PD . Secondary objective assessment test-retest variability confirm previous finding [ 18F ] FEOBV validation . Both secondary objective prerequisite main objective . In addition , explorative analysis relationship neuropsychological performance cholinergic innervation perform . Study design : In order establish difference [ 18F ] FEOBV binding PD patient healthy control subject , study conduct three part . - The first part study establish [ 18F ] FEOBV PET tracer application clinical research confirm previous finding [ 18F ] FEOBV validation . This include dynamic scan 3 healthy control subject 3 imaging session ( 0-120 , 150-180 , 210-240 min injection [ 18F ] FEOBV ) . From part study , optimal short static scan period determine compare relative uptake value result kinetic analysis . - Part 2 study evaluate difference [ 18F ] FEOBV Parkinson 's disease healthy control . For , three dynamic scan part 1 use additional 7 healthy control subject 10 PD patient include simple static scan ( period determine part 1 study ) . - In part 3 , test-retest variability evaluate group . Of group , 5 patient undergo short second static scan . All subject screen within 30 day PET scan demographic information detail clinical history . Study population : In total , 10 PD patient 10 age match control subject include study , age 45-65 year . Of 10 control subject , 3 undergo full dynamic scanning , subject include undergo simple static scanning . A total 10 subject , 5 group , undergo second static scan . The patient group include patient Parkinson 's disease disease duration least 3 year maximum 10 year . All subject undergo neuropsychological assessment . Main study parameters/endpoints : The main endpoint study difference VAChT brain binding [ 18F ] FEOBV PET-scan PD patient healthy control subject . Secondary endpoint test-retest variability patient healthy control subject , neuropsychological performance group .</detailed_description>
