	<brief_summary>This phase 2 study see effective investigational drug , JNJ-42756493 , give combination dexamethasone two group patient multiple myeloma ( cancer plasma cell , type white blood cell present bone marrow ) relapse ( come back period improvement ) refractory ( respond standard treatment ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Testing JNJ-42756493 In Combination With Dexamethasone Multiple Myeloma That Came Back After Period Improvement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants study assign one two group : One group participants FGFR3 wild-type ( participant whose tumor mutation change gene call FGFR3 ) group FGFR3 mutate ( participant whose tumor mutation FGFR3 ) . Participants receive JNJ-42756493 dexamethasone long disease progress ( worsen ) experience unacceptable side effect maximum 24 cycle ( approximately 22 month ) . While study drug , participant ask visit clinic 2 time Cycles 1 2 Cycle 3 subsequent cycle test procedure .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>A diagnosis MM documentation least 1 prior line therapy include proteasome immunomodulatory agent . Documented lab result confirm FGFR3 expression mutational status determine clinical grade , next generation sequence platform approve SponsorInvestigator , result must obtain prior registration . Patients measurable disease laboratory study determine eligibility must obtain within 28 day prior start study drug ) : Must Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status score 0 , 1 , 2 . Negative pregnancy status woman childbearing potential must confirm within 7 day prior start study drug . Participants must use medically acceptable method birth control study entry , study , 3 month take last dose study drug . Patient must sign informed consent document indicate understand purpose procedure require study willing participate study . Life Expectancy ≥ 3 month . Able take oral medication . Acceptable laboratory result must meet within 7 day first study drug administration . Patients FGFR3 expression mutational status determine . Chemotherapy , limit palliative radiotherapy antimyeloma therapy within 14 day prior first dose study drug . In addition , treatment related toxicity recover &lt; Grade 1 unless deem irreversible . Patients receive investigational agent . Patients know CNS involvement , plasma cell leukemia amyloidosis . Use investigational drug within 21 day fivehalflives , whichever short less 14 day , precede first dose study drug . History allogeneic stem cell transplant . Autologous , peripheral stem cell transplant within 12 week first dose study drug . Prior major surgical procedure extensive radiation therapy within 4 week first dose study treatment . Current use corticosteroid , exception inhale topical steroid . Previous concurrent malignancy allow clear patient symptomatic tumor . The subject must receive active therapy tumor tumor must consider medically stable . Has history current uncontrolled cardiovascular disease . Patients evidence mucosal internal bleeding and/or platelet transfusion refractory . Patients use growth factor within 7 day start study drug , transfusion blood platelet within 7 day start study drug . Has impair wound heal capacity define skin/decubitus ulcer , chronic leg ulcer , know gastric ulcer , unhealed incision . Serious psychiatric illness , active alcoholism , drug addiction may hinder confuse followup evaluation . Any condition , Investigator 's opinion , would contraindicate patient 's participation clinical study due safety concern compliance clinical study procedure . Received prior FGFR inhibitor treatment subject know allergy , hypersensitivity , intolerance JNJ42756493 excipients . Pregnant , breast feeding , plan become pregnant within 3 month last dose study drug male plan father child enrol study within 5 month last dose study drug . Known HIV active hepatitis B C viral infection . History cerebrovascular accident ( CVA ) within 6 month prior registration . Gastrointestinal abnormality , include bowel obstruction , inability take oral medication , requirement intravenous ( IV ) alimentation , active peptic ulcer prior surgical procedure bowel resection affect absorption . Peripheral neuropathy ≥ Grade 2 . Has persistent phosphate level &gt; ULN screening ( within 14 day treatment prior Cycle 1 Day 1 ) despite medical management . Any corneal retinal abnormality likely increase risk eye toxicity . Patients require follow prohibit therapy : 1 . Medicines know risk cause QTc prolongation Torsades de Pointes 2 . Medications know increase serum level phosphate calcium 3 . Medications substance know strong inhibitor strong inducer CYP3A4 CYP2C9 recommend 5 halflife washout period</criteria>
