	<brief_summary>This study employ two monitoring device prototype . The device sensor contain accelerometer gyroscope . The raw output data analyze determine patient move repositioned bed . The data capture within modem correlate movement video recording interpretation research team . One sensor wearable patient gown sleepwear , place underneath frame hospital bed . The investigator propose non-blinded trial n=10 subject undergo two device . A video camera place subject room record reposition event correlate monitor signal actual subject repositioning capture video . The goal trial validate ability sensor prototype accurately detect subject turn , order reduce stationary positioning contributes incidence pressure ulcer improve compliance patient reposition trial .</brief_summary>
