	<brief_summary>Difficulty manage airway single important cause major anesthesia-related morbidity mortality . The currently use clinical method predict airway difficulty use anesthetist limit highly sensitive specific . Any additional bedside method increase specificity sensitivity would valuable . This project design study measure tongue thickness oral cavity height use ultrasound scan comparing measurement obtain CT scan . These also compare complicate measurement use previous study investigate correlation currently use clinical method . This information help u decide ultrasound may help Anesthesiologists assess difficulty airway management accurate , precise reliable simpler method .</brief_summary>
