	<detailed_description>Background Degenerative mitral valve disease common cause organic mitral regurgitation Western World . The preferred treatment organic mitral regurgitation mitral valve repair . Optimally time late commensurate risk surgery irreversibly damage heart pulmonary vessel . According current guideline mitral valve surgery indicate symptomatic patient severe MR presence know risk factor . The optimal timing surgery still controversial asymptomatic patient without risk factor . The overall aim present study obtain good understanding central hemodynamics rest physical exercise symptomatic asymptomatic patient organic mitral regurgitation , relation neurohormonal activation myocardial fibrosis , identify noninvasive echocardiographic measure suitable estimation . A epidemiologic sub-study aim asses whether MR associate inherence , familial cluster mitral regurgitation earlier suggest base mainly small observational study , case report . Methods The study test A : Symptomatic organic MR characterize high filling pressure , high stroke work physical strain compare asymptomatic MR. B : The extent myocardial fibrosis associate filling pressure cardiac index 1 year mitral valve repair . C : Filling pressure estimate non-invasively echocardiography . To test 40 patient asymptomatic MR 40 patient symptomatic MR undergo stress echocardiography simultaneous echocardiography invasive measurement central hemodynamics . In symptomatic patient undergo surgery , examination repeat 1 year surgical mitral valve repair . In addition pulmonary function test , maximal oxygen consumption test cardiac MRI perform . The Danish Twin Registry The Danish National Patient Registry use identify twin MR . The hypothesis concordance rate higher monozygotic twin compare dizygotic twin .</detailed_description>
