	<brief_title>Sofosbuvir Plus Ravidasvir Treatment HCV Chronic Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study ass efficacy safety SOF-RDV across genotype , among non-cirrhotic cirrhotic CTP class A , interferon/ribavirin naïve experience , HCV mono-infected HCV/HIV co-infected subject . It also study pharmacokinetics RDV , HCV/HIV co-infected subject , possible drug-drug interaction antiretrovirals . The treatment duration 12 week subject cirrhosis ( Metavir F0 F3 ) 24 week subject compensate cirrhosis ( Metavir F4 , CTP class A ) . After enrollment first 300 evaluable patient complete , enrollment pause data accumulate analyzed . After review interim result independent Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) , study Steering Committee , enrollment resume . Should modification study design require upon interim analysis , decision take study steer committee amend protocol expand protocol submit Ethics Committee approval .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Evidence chronic HCV infection , define : Positive antiHCV antibody detectable HCV RNA HCV genotype least 6 month screen HCV viral load ≥104 IU/mL time screen In subject without document HCV test result 6 month screen , chronic hepatitis C infection assume risk exposure occur &gt; 6 month prior screen HCV viral load ≥104 IU/mL time screen . Willing able provide write informed consent . Men woman age ≥ 18 year &lt; 70 year . Body Mass Index ( BMI ) 18 35 kg/m2 . Intention comply dose instruction study drug administration able complete study schedule assessment . Women negative pregnancy test screen baseline . Women child bear potential accept effective contraception 2 week prior study day 1 1 month posttreatment ( Double contraceptive method include least one barrier method ) . A woman nonchild bear potential ( ) reach natural menopause determine retrospectively 12 month amenorrhea without obvious medical cause ( b ) procedures like bilateral tubal ligation hysterectomy bilateral oophorectomy . Subjects compliant opioid substitution maintenance program may include long concern study medication adherence interaction compliance study schedule . Active illicit drug user may also enrol , prestratified subpopulation , however data contribute primary intent treat analysis Decompensated cirrhosis define : Evidence advance stage liver cirrhosis ChildTurcottePugh ( CTP ) Class B C CTP score &gt; 6 ) current/past history decompensation include ascites , variceal bleeding , spontaneous bacterial peritonitis , hepatic encephalopathy . Hepatocellular carcinoma To exclude hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) , liver image within 6 month prior screen require subject cirrhosis must continue periodically routine HCC surveillance . Additional laboratory exclusion criterion : cirrhotic subject albumin &lt; 2.8 g/dL direct bilirubin &gt; 3xULN AST , ALT &gt; 10xULN Low neutrophil count ( ≤599 cells/mm3 ) , hemoglobin ( &lt; 9.0 g/dL male , &lt; 8.5 g/dL female ) , platelet ( &lt; 50000 cells/mm3 ) classify ≥ Grade 3 Patients serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 ULN end stage renal disease Hepatitis B coinfection ( HBsAg positive ) Pregnancy , document positive pregnancy test screen baseline Breastfeeding Subjects currently receive unable stop use least 1 week prior receive first dose study drug medication herbal supplement know potent inhibitor moderate inducer cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) 3A4 potent inducer Pglycoprotein . This include subject amiodarone contraindicate drug Participation clinical trial within 3 month , except upon agreement study steer committee . Any clinically significant finding unstable condition screening , medical history physical examination , investigator 's opinion , would compromise participation study . This could include patient poorly control hypertension , asthma , diabetes , lifethreatening condition . Current history use within precede 6 month immunosuppressive immunemodulating agent . History solid organ bone marrow transplantation . Any prior NS5A inhibitor therapy . Patients significant cardiovascular condition include myocardial infarction within previous 6 month heart failure NYHA class III IV ; history Torsade de pointes ; QTcF value ≥ 450 millisecond third degree heart block ; Use medication associate QT prolongation concurrently within 30 day prior Screening Visit , include : macrolides , antiarrhythmic agent , azoles , fluoroquinolones , tricyclic antidepressant . Note : An electrocardiogram perform screen case doubt , subject refer cardiologist advice . Subjects instruct immediately consult experience dizziness , light headedness fainting spell . HIV/HCV coinfected patient yet stable antiretroviral therapy ART treatment initiation maybe schedule study period .</criteria>
