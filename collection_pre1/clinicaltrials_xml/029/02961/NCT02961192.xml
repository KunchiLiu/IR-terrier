	<detailed_description>This four-arm , one-year randomized , control trial . The study conduct use Way Health , automate information technology platform University Pennsylvania integrate wireless device , conduct clinical trial randomization enrollment process , delivers message ( text email ) deliver self-administered survey , automate payment transfer , securely capture data research purpose . The study team identify potential participant electronic health record University Pennsylvania Health System . Interested participant instruct visit study website create account , review complete informed consent , complete eligibility survey . Eligible participant instruct obtain hemoglobin A1c LDL-C laboratory test . If hemoglobin A1c 8.0 great participant still interested continue enrollment process , wearable activity track device mail . After , participant schedule in-person visit study team complete enrollment process . Participants randomly assign block four group one four study arm stratify base whether group individual already know . Groups three individual unless individual already socially connect prior study , case allow randomize group two three . Participants randomize control arm receive intervention . Each participant intervention arm ask choose goal study follow : 1 ) Choose weight loss goal 6 % , 7 % , 8 % baseline weight round next pound ; 2 ) Choose daily step count goal 33 % , 40 % , 50 % great baseline round nearest hundred , choose step goal long least 1500 step baseline ; 3 ) Choose HbA1c reduction goal 1.5 % , 2 % , 2.5 % . Participants arm 2-4 entered intervention approach point level design incorporate insight behavioral economics . On daily basis , ask weigh-in . They weekly weight target mean step goal . Weekly feedback differ among three arm induce different social incentive . The primary outcome variable change mean daily step , weight pound , hemoglobin A1c baseline end one-year study .</detailed_description>
