	<detailed_description>Benign prostate hypertrophy ( BPH ) inflammation common non-cancerous enlargement prostate , result urinary interference incomplete drainage bladder . Compression urethra common cause resistance full draining , may time result progressive hypertrophy , instability , urgency , nocturia weakness bladder musculature . Prostatic growth frequently begin 30 , estimate 50 % male benign enlargement lead 75 % age 80 . BPH low grade inflammation one ten prominent costly disorder male 50 . BPH often progressive disease may lead increase urinary stasis increase risk urinary tract infection . Urinary tract symptom divide issue storage , void , post-void symptom associate bladder outlet obstruction ( BOO ) . Storage symptom include need urinate frequently , wake night urinate ( nocturia ) , incontinence ( involuntary ) . Voiding issue include urinary hesitancy , intermittency ( start/stopping flow ) , leak voiding may include pain ( dysuria ) associate urination . Post-voiding symptom include abdominal pain , feel full bladder , acute urinary retention frequency , dysuria , hesitancy , etc . Causation may associate age relate change androgen ( testosterone others ) , seem direct cause enlargement . Androgens promote prostate cell proliferation , relatively low level testosterone often find patient BPH . Treatment often aim lifestyle change ( exercise , decrease nighttime fluid intake , moderate alcohol caffeine , decrease certain anticholinergic medication . Use medication advantage , include alpha blocker 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor , broad spectrum antibiotic ( like Ciprofloxacin ) seem help many increase symptom . Self catheterization surgery occasionally need patient comfort reduction symptomatology . Alternative remedy include herbal remedy ( saw palmetto ) anecdotal effect patient receive parenteral stem/stromal cell therapy clinical issue . Initially commented patient report improvement symptom , lead study determine long-interval therapy may effective surgery catheterization . This study utilizes isolation adipose-derived stem/stromal cellular stromal vascular fraction ( AD-cSVF ) deploy IV suspension sterile Normal Saline ( 500cc ) . Due anti-inflammatory immunomodulatory effect common AD-cSVF tested relief inflammatory element concurrent hypertrophy BPH .
