	<brief_summary>Peanut allergy ( PA ) well study prevalence estimate 1.3 % Europe . Tree nut ( TN ) allergy PA clinically similar often coexist , TN allergy prevalence range 0.05 4.9 % . TN allergy longlasting nearly TN associate fatal allergic reaction . Other legume TN also contain seed storage protein orthologs globulin ( Ara h1 , Ara h 3 ) 2S albumin ( Ara h 2 ) peanut , susceptible provoke allergic reaction , cross-reactivity TN legumes PA patient could also appear primarily sensitization . These possible IgE-binding cross-reactions bring recommend avoidance TN legumes never eat PA child . In context , diagnosis work-up relevant cross-allergy versus asymptomatic cross-sensitization impact directly child 's health-related quality life ( HRQL ) . When physician suspect food allergy , many parameter consider , clinical background , clinical history , type symptom relate suspect food cross-allergy food . Then , objectively confirm food allergy ass severity ( related threshold reactive dose symptom ) , oral food challenge ( OFC ) demand , double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge ( DBPCFC ) consider `` gold standard '' . Although OFC available diagnosis PA , assessment cross-allergy every single allergenic TN legumes require full allergy work-up often many year follow-up . Few study investigate cross-allergy TN legume , rate cross-allergy TN 28 % 50 % . However , target patient severe cross-allergic phenotype would greatly assist allergist management follow-up PA patient ( i.e. , plan OFC cross-reactive food ) . Our main objective identify different disease phenotype PA child cluster analysis . This statistical approach never perform identify cross-allergic phenotype . We also describe cross-allergy PA identify possible risk factor cross-allergy TN legumes PA child .</brief_summary>
