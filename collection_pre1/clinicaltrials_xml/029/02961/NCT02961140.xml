	<detailed_description>Anesthetic management fluid therapy crucial esophageal resection reconstruction , associate high incidence postoperative morbidity mortality . Excessive fluid administration may result pulmonary complication , extremely hypovolemia may lead shock , circulatory dysfunction , renal damage . Little known fluid status impact anastomotic leakage . Goal-directed fluid therapy show benefit perioperative outcome major abdominal surgery . This study aim investigate effect goal direct fluid management postoperative outcome esophageal resection reconstruction .</detailed_description>
