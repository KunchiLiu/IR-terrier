	<brief_summary>Rationale : Previous review show evidence regard effectiveness sacral neuromodulation ( SNM ) patient therapy-resistant , idiopathic ( slow-transit ) constipation suboptimal quality . Furthermore , estimate cost cost-effectiveness patient group . Study design : A prospective cohort study one group . This study conduct next randomized control clinical trial ( RCT ) 'the effectiveness cost-effectiveness sacral neuromodulation patient idiopathic slow-transit constipation refractory conservative treatment ' ( information ClinicalTrial.gov ID : NCT02961582 ) . This RCT part temporary reimbursement arrangement , call conditional reimbursement health care ( Dutch : Voorwaardelijke Toelating ) National Health Care Institute ( Zorginstituut Nederland ) . As part arrangement , Ministry Health , Welfare Sports require SNM remain available eligible patient conditional reimbursement period , also inclusion RCT end . Furthermore , Ministry require patient received personalized conservative treatment RCT ( control group ) , offer SNM completion follow-up 6 month . As result , National Health Care Institute require patient receive SNM outside RCT include prospective cohort study able collect data . Aim : The aim prospective cohort study collect ( uncontrolled ) information regard safety effectiveness SNM . Study population : Adolescent ( 14-17 year ) adult ( 18-80 year ) patient idiopathic slow-transit constipation refractory conservative treatment . Intervention : The intervention SNM , minimally invasive surgical procedure consist two phase . In screen phase electrode insert near third sacral nerve connect external stimulator . If screening phase successful ( average defecation frequency ( DF ) ≥3 week ) , electrode connect pacemaker implant buttock patient . If successful , pacemaker remove patient receive conservative treatment . Main study parameters/endpoints : The primary outcome treatment success 6 month , define average DF ≥3 week accord 3-week defecation diary safety . Secondary outcome strain , sense incomplete evacuation , constipation severity generic ( health-related ) quality life ( ( HR ) QOL ) .</brief_summary>
