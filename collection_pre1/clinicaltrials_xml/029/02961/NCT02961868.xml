	<brief_title>Cohort Follow-up Patients With Renal Craniocervical Fibromuscular Dysplasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Fibromuscular dysplasia ( FMD ) group nonatherosclerotic , noninflammatory arterial disease usually involve renal carotid artery . Patients FMD may present renovascular hypertension and/or cerebrovascular symptom . The prevalence FMD hypertensive patient estimate 4/1000 . Angiographic classification include multifocal type , multiple stenoses 'string-of-beads ' appearance relate medial FMD , tubular focal type clearly relate specific histological lesion . FMD may affect one vascular bed progress severe stenosis renal cerebrovascular complication . FMD appear familial 10 % case ( OMIM # 135580 ) . Renal artery FMD may progress severe stenosis renal atrophy , and/or stenosis affect artery within outside renal vasculature . The risk progression assess available study probably overestimate documentation progression obtain angiography , procedure routinely undertaken patient favourable clinical biological outcome . The disease progressive , however , literature state patient FMD undergo yearly duplex ultrasonography detect progression disease , restenosis , loss kidney volume . There data prognosis patient symptomatic carotid vertebral artery FMD . The risk arterial disease progression time unknown . The risk ischemic stroke range 0 3 % per year study assess issue . Objectives The primary objective estimate incidence risk factor progression FMD lesion . This assessed comparison initial 3 year abdominal supra-aortic trunk vascular imaging ( angiography , CT-angiography Magnetic Resonance ( MR ) angiography ) , monitor downstream consequence development lesion progression clinical event . The secondary objective : - estimate rate genetic polymorphism may influence disease progression associate complication - ass frequency multi-site FMD ( common objective ARCADIA study ) - collect standardized clinical , radiological , biological data patient FMD national registry ( common objective ARCADIA study ) - organize clinical , radiological biological database biobank constitute unique resource initiate clinical research ( common objective ARCADIA study ) .</detailed_description>
