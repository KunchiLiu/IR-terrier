Aim : The investigators´ hypothesis 1. exists specific identifiable subgroup patient within chronic low back pain ( CLBP ) group pain emanate sacro-iliac ( SI ) joint , 2. patient subgroup may select base thorough symptom analysis , 3. arthrodesis actual joint/s may reduce pelvic pain . Methods : A RCT parallel group design pre- post-treatment data . Inclusion woman 18-55 year old pronounce pelvic pain least 2 year try ordinary physical therapy without improvement sick leave least 50 percent .

Outcome : The primary outcome perceive pelvic pain accord assessment validate Balanced Inventory Spinal Disorders questionnaire ( BIS ) Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) treatment follow-up one year treatment . The perceived change pain also assess transitional scale follow-up version BIS .

	<detailed_description>Study description 1. . Title Sacro-iliac joint arthrodesis non-operative care treatment chronic pelvic pain . A randomized study . Introduction Background objectives 2. a. Pelvic pain common pregnancy usually subside delivery . Some woman , however , experience severe long-standing pelvic pain , judge emanate SI-joints . Radiological correlate absent diverge opinion regard value different clinical testing procedure use anaesthetic block reveal SI-joint origin pain . In case slight moderate pain situation may solve use analgetics physical therapy , case severe pain situation might end discussion whether surgery arthrodesis SI joint might value . To knowledge , however , result surgical treatment compare non-surgical treatment randomize study . 2 b . The investigators´ hypothesis 1. exists specific identifiable subgroup patient within chronic low back pain ( CLBP ) group pain emanate sacro-iliac ( SI ) joint , 2. patient subgroup may select base thorough symptom analysis , 3. arthrodesis actual joint/s may reduce pelvic pain . 3 . A RCT parallel group design pre- post-treatment data . 3 b . No change make trial commencement . Participant 4 . Inclusion criterion Women 18-55 year old pronounce pelvic pain least 2 year try ordinary physical therapy without improvement sick leave least 50 percent . 4 b . Eligible outpatient Clinic Spinal Surgery , Strängnäs , Sweden , inform study consent participate include . The woman receive ordinary treatment . Data collect Clinic Spinal Surgery , Strängnäs , Sweden . Interventions 5 . A percutaneous mechanical provocation test develop obtain information regard possible pain origin SI joint . Injections saline local anaesthetic blind patient perform posterior aspect SI joint , intra-articular , analyse pain response needle contact joint capsule , pain reaction injection also pain situation first hour injection . Operation perform posterior approach bone transplantation iliac bone sacrum , use microsurgical technique . Internal fixation use . Patients group , surgical ( S ) non-surgical ( NS ) treat formal physiotherapy five day stay Clinic instruct continue training home accord line give Clinic . 6 . The primary outcome perceive pelvic pain accord assessment validate Balanced Inventory Spinal Disorders questionnaire ( BIS ) VAS treatment follow-up one year treatment . The perceived change pain also assess transitional scale follow-up version BIS . Secondary patient report outcome measure ( PROM ) pain related function assess Oswestry Disability Index questionnaire ( ODI ) , BIS Roland-Morris questionnaire . Health related quality life assess use SF-36 EQ-5D questionnaire . 6 b . No change trial make study . Sample size The sample size estimation perform study start statistician ( ES ) . It base previous experience improvement 55-60 % patient undergoing SI-joint arthrodesis compare 10 % follow physiotherapy . Assuming similar result improvement total sample size 34 ( 17 + 17 ) detect difference statistical power 80 % ( p &lt; 0.05 ) use statistical method design change rating scale assessment . 7b . No interim analysis perform . Randomization 8 b . A randomization scheme balance surgery /non-surgery patient perform use random permute block order reduce predictability . A set close envelope number order message `` operate '' `` operate '' deliver Clinic statistician ( ES ) involve treatment patient . Allocation concealment mechanism 9 . The patient consecutively include study accord randomization envelope . Implementation 10 . A statistician involved treatment patient generate random allocation sequence . The surgeon enrol participant research nurse Clinic perform practical assignment , i.e . open close envelope consecutive order . Blinding 11 . In accordance treatment alternative participant care giver could blind group assignment . 11 b . Patients group , surgical non-surgical , receive equal treatment formal physiotherapy . Besides , patient surgical group operate arthrodesis . Statistical method 12 b . The patient report outcome variable ( PROMs ) assess rating scale generate ordered categorical data . Characteristic feature order structure lack information regard size inter-categorical distance . Non-parametric rank-based statistical method take account limited mathematical property order categorical data use description analysis . Frequency distribution , proportion , bar chart , median quartile use statistical description . Statistical analysis difference outcome assess transitional scale BIS two group patient perform Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test . Statistical evaluation change pair assessment make treatment follow-up occasion make Svensson´s method pair ordinal data provide measure systematic change common group additional measure individual variability . The measure 95 % confidence interval systematic change position ( RP ) , concentration ( RC ) , measure additional individual variability ( RV ) calculate well difference measure two treatment group . This statistical approach find high power detect difference small sample . Results 13 . All patient group receive allocated treatment patient group also see follow-up . Recruitment 14 . Recruitment start October 22 , 2008 end last patient include study November 19 , 2011 . The follow-up take place October 27 , 2009 November 19 , 2012 . 14 b . The trial perform plan stop 3 year 19 patient included difficulty recruit eligible patient within reasonable time . 16 . The analysis carry complete group 9 patient Surgery group 10 patient NonSurgery group . 17 b . The analysis ongoing . Ancillary analysis 18 . None . Harms 19 . Will report analysis complete . Comment Limitation 20 . There small sample size difficulty recruit eligible patient , good research team choice appropriate statistical analysis show power study . Generalizability 21 . Provided patient select accord criterion present study surgery perform way result may generalizable . 22 . During last year remarkable increase see number article publish concern arthrodesis case presume SI-joint pain , due use minimal invasive technique . This increase SI-joint surgery , however , result good pre-operative evaluation patient . To knowledge study first RCT . Other information Registration 23 . The study protocol approve Regional Ethics Committee , Stockholm , ( reference number 2008/289-31/3 ) . In accordance Declaration Helsinki , patient thoroughly inform concerning part study , verbally write text , give write informed consent . 24 . Then full trial protocol access via Bo Nyström , Clinic Spinal Surgery , Strängnäs , Sweden , present address Regementsgatan 20 B , 64533 Strängnäs , Sweden . 25 . The study fund support .</detailed_description>
