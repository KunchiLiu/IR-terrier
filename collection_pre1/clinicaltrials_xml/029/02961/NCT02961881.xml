	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : • To evaluate safety tolerability every 12 hour ( q12h ) every 24 hour ( q24h ) administration subcutaneous ( SC ) blinatumomab Secondary Objectives : - To determine pharmacokinetics ( PK ) continuous intravenous ( cIV ) SC administration - To estimate maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) test blinatumomab administer subcutaneously - To determine incidence anti-blinatumomab antibody formation follow SC administration - To evaluate efficacy response follow treatment SC blinatumomab administration Exploratory Objective : - To determine pharmacodynamics ( PD ) time profile B-and T-lymphocytes well cytokine profile SC administration - To evaluate efficacy response follow treatment SC blinatumomab administration use Lugano criterion</brief_summary>

In addition , must disease primary refractory initial therapy relapse disease . Follicular Lymphoma I , II , IIIA Marginal zone lymphoma ( extranodal , nodal splenic ) . Subjects gastric mucosaassociated lymphoid tissue must progress Helicobacter pylorus therapy radiation . Subjects splenic marginal zone lymphoma must prior splenectomy . Lymphoplasmocytic lymphoma Mantle cell lymphoma ( [ MCL ] exception aggressive MCL , define Ki67 &gt; 30 % , blastoid histology ) Small lymphocytic lymphoma Disease status must 1 following : Primary refractory ( least 1 prior line therapy ) Relapsed within 1 year first response Responded initial therapy ≥ 1 year relapse 2 line therapy , include antiCD20 monoclonal antibody At least 1 prior line therapy primary refractory relapse within 1 year . Subjects respond initial therapy great equal 1 year must least 2 prior line therapy include antiCD20 monoclonal antibody . Measurable disease previously irradiate positron emission tomography compute tomography ( PETCT ) least 1.5 cm within last 2 week start IP treatment . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status less equal 2 ( Appendix D ) . Life expectancy great equal 3 month determine treat physician . Subjects must adequate organ marrow screen define : Platelets great equal 50,000 mcL Total bilirubin less equal 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) Creatinine clearance great equal 50 mL/min ( CockcroftGault ) Currently receive treatment another investigational device drug study , less 30 day end treatment another investigational device drug study ( y ) start IP treatment . Other investigational procedure participate study exclude . Known hypersensitivity immunoglobulins component study drug Subject likely available complete protocol require study visit procedure best subject investigator 's knowledge History evidence clinically significant disorder , condition disease ( exception outline ) , opinion investigator Amgen physician , consult , would pose risk subject safety interfere study evaluation procedure completion . Subjects treatment anticancer agent include rituximab obinutuzumab and/or monoclonal antibody radioimmunotherapy within 6 week start IP treatment . Autologous stem cell transplantation within 12 week start IP treatment past history allogeneic stem cell transplantation . Subjects receive antiCD 19 targeted therapy , chimeric antigen receptor Tcell cellular therapy treatment lymphoma . Subjects suspect known brain metastasis exclude clinical study poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event .
