	<brief_summary>The study divide two part . The first part study test various dos ASN003 find high safe dose test three specific group . The second part study test well ASN003 control cancer . Subjects enrol one three group . Group 1 : metastatic recurrent melanoma document BRAFV600 mutation ( n=20 evaluable patient ) Group 2 : metastatic colorectal cancer ( CRC ) , advance non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) document BRAFV600 mutation ( n=14 evaluable patient ) Group 3 : advanced solid tumor document PI3K pathway alteration ( PIK3CA mutation PTEN loss ) ( n=14 evaluable patient )</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study ASN003 Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study conduct two part . Part A dose escalation study determine safe tolerable dose ASN003 subject advanced solid tumor . Part A also characterize pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics ASN003 blood sample optional biopsies.. Part B enroll subject three group : Group 1 : subject metastatic recurrent melanoma BRAFv600 mutation . Group 2 : subject advance metastatic non-small cell lung cancer , colorectal cancer BRAFv600 mutation . Group 3 : subject advance metastatic cancer phosphatidylinositide 3-kinases ( PI3K ) mutation , phosphatase tensin homolog ( PTEN ) loss mutation . Subjects treat high safe tolerable dose determine Part A study determine preliminary efficacy . Subjects may continue receive ASN003 1 year absence severe side effect disease progression .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>write informed consent obtain prior studyrelated procedure . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status : 01 Part A : Histologically cytologically confirm metastatic and/or advance solid tumor document progressive disease standard therapy indicate . Part B : 5 . Histologically cytologically confirm , molecularly select ( i.e . BRAFV600 positive and/or PI3K mutation positive ) advance solid tumor . Prior molecular characterization base use regulatory approve assay analytically validate assay . Group 1 : BRAFV600 positive metastatic recurrent melanoma failure prior treatment standard therapy checkpoint inhibitor approve BRAF inhibitor ( vemurafenib dabrafenib ) Group 2 : BRAFV600 positive metastatic colorectal carcinoma ( CRC ) , advance nonsmall cell lung carcinoma ( NSCLC ) failure least two line prior standard therapy standard therapy indicate . Group 3 : Advanced solid tumor PI3K pathway alteration ( PIK3CA mutation PTEN loss ) failure least one line prior standard therapy standard therapy indicate . Prior treatment may include inhibitor PI3K pathway . Screening hematology value follow : absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1000/μL , platelet ≥ 100,000/μL , hemoglobin ≥ 10 g/dL ( without transfusion support ) ; Screening chemistry value follow : alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate transaminase ( AST ) ≤ 3.0 × upper limit normal reference range ( ULN ) , total bilirubin ≤ 2 × ULN , creatinine ≤ 1.5 × ULN , fast blood glucose &lt; 140 mg/dL , hemoglobin A1C ≤ ULN , albumin ≥ 2.8 g/dL . Screening fast lipid panel : LDL cholesterol &lt; 190 mg/dL , triglycerides &lt; 300 mg/dL Subject willing able comply protocol require visit assessment , include biopsy assign MTD expansion cohort ; Have receive prior chemotherapy , investigational therapy , major surgery within 4 week Day 1 ; Have receive oral anticancer therapy oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor within 14 day 5 halflives , whichever longer . Have receive prior treatment monoclonal antibody within 6 week first dose Day 1 ; Subject receive live virus vaccine within previous 8 week . Have know central nervous system metastasis primary tumor ( Part A ) . Previouslytreated , CNS metastasis permit Part B. CNS metastasis must small , discrete metastasis ; stable least 30 day without need concomitant prednisone symptom management . No leptomeningeal disease allow . Is receive therapeutic dos corticosteroid ( &gt; 20 mg prednisone daily equivalent ) ; Has serious concurrent medical condition : history Diabetes Mellitus , type 1 type 2 , know autoimmune disease , know bleed diathesis , history congestive heart failure New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) class III IV ; uncontrolled hypertension ( systolic BP ≥ 139 mmHg diastolic BP ≥ 89 mmHg ) screening , despite optimal antihypertensive therapy , clinically significant heart disease include limited : myocardial infarction , arterial thrombotic event past 6 month , severe unstable angina , know cardiac ejection fraction measurement &lt; 50 % ; history family history long QT syndrome ; 12Lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) abnormality consider investigator clinically significant QTcF ≥ 450 millisecond , regardless clinical significance , screen . Abnormal ECG may confirm one repeat assessment . For subject QTcF ≥ 450 msec initial ECG , mean two QTcF assessment determine eligibility ; uncontrolled psychiatric illness ; serious persistent infection within 14 day prior start study medication ; know gastrointestinal disease condition may affect absorption ASN003 ; know active symptomatic viral hepatitis , chronic liver disease liver cirrhosis ; know glaucoma preexist ocular condition may put patient risk ocular toxicity . know condition situation may put patient significant risk , may confound study result , may interfere significantly subject 's participation study Female subject pregnant breast feeding</criteria>
