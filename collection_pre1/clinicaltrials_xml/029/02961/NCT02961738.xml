	<brief_title>Is Narrative Reformulation During Cognitive Analytic Therapy Helpful ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale Despite extensive outcome research validate psychotherapy general effective treatment , outcome literature slow identify effective , active ingredient individual therapy . It propose different active ingredient within therapy relate outcome ; definitive technical feature hypothesise gain importance psychopathology increase . Therefore research necessary compare component overall treatment assess contribution outcome . Cognitive analytic therapy ( CAT ) brief therapy ( 16 24 session intervention ) draw upon component cognitive , psychodynamic psychotherapy . CAT propose use specific intervention identify time point within therapy , reformulation letter period assessment . This narrative account reformulates distress , explicitly link problematic repetitive behavioural pattern developmental origin . The client 's current life situation describe alongside target problem underlie maladaptive procedure . The reformulation letter consider 'crucial therapeutic task ' 'powerful agent change ' , ability act manner largely assume evidence base claim poorly research . Reformulation Despite numerous claim regard benefit cognitive case formulation , paucity methodologically sound research . This magnify look specifically CAT reformulation process . Existing research focus accuracy , whilst research exist regard impact reformulation , narrative case study generalise . Research utilise single case experimental design methodology identify evidence sudden gain point reformulation . Depression The introduction Increasing Access Psychological Therapies ( IAPT ) initiative focus use brief , evidence base therapy client group particularly CBT step 3 step care model . However , CAT increasingly use primary care setting naturalistic evidence base grow regard effectiveness treat depression . The contract shorten 'the threshold consultation low ' patient symptomology suggest mild disturbance . Working predetermined time limit act heighten therapeutic process whilst protect over-dependence ; hence time-limited intervention clinically effective lengthy therapy people . Brief CAT intervention may therefore use mild moderate depression . Aims The propose study aim : 1 . Investigate impact reformulation letter mild-moderately depressed client term therapeutic alliance helpfulness therapy 2 . Compare outcomes ( symptom amelioration ) depress client receive reformulation letter part therapy n't receive reformulation letter time include follow-up . 3 . Provide initial practice-based evidence effectiveness 8-session CAT Primary Care depress client . Hypotheses Clients receive reformulation letter : 1 . Display enhance therapeutic alliance comparison client receive CAT without letter . 2 . Perceive therapy helpful comparison client receive CAT without letter . 3 . Achieve good outcome ( great symptom amelioration ) comparison client receive CAT without letter . Theoretical Clinical Implications The propose study add nascent evidence base CAT , regard impact reformulation letter therapeutic process , outcome effectiveness . Comparing impact receive reformulation letter versus exclude specific event allow effect isolate . This contribute theoretical understanding active ingredient CAT , particularly role specific tool . In addition may inform debate surround role specific versus non-specific contribution therapy . Identifying tools augment treatment effectiveness offer potential improve therapeutic outcome . Improved understanding specific tool augment therapeutic process affect outcomes clinical utility . Producing negotiate reformulation letter take valuable therapist , in-session time . Their use , impact perceive helpfulness therefore important investigate thoroughly . This perhaps great importance brief therapy , time valuable resource . Furthermore , explore potential utility brief 8-session CAT primary care mental health problem provide test whether CAT could adapt shortened match service demand Primary Care . Design Utilising randomise deconstruction methodology , participant randomly allocate one two active study arm ( e.g . 'reformulation letter CAT ' 'no reformulation letter CAT ' ) . Outcome measure match take session-by-session basis , prior , , follow CAT treatment arm enable comparison relative efficacy . Method Participants Participants recruit via Barnsley PCT 's 's Improving Access Psychological Therapies ( IAPT ) service . They work age adult ( 18-65 ) , refer primary care mental health service mild moderate depression . The study aim recruit 24 participant total . For supervisory purpose , fidelity CAT model assess use : A measure CAT competence ( CCAT ; Bennett &amp; Parry , 2004 ) . The CCAT measure therapist competence ten domains related practice model characteristic . Validity , reliability internal consistency establish sufficient ( Bennett &amp; Parry , 2004 ) . Procedure A Consultant Cognitive Behavioural Psychotherapist identify client meet inclusion criterion study . Suitable participant provide information sheet explain research invite participate . Clients agree participate ask sign consent form . The consent form clarify participant read information sheet opportunity ask question . The voluntary nature participation , confidentiality , right withdraw time state . Consent seek audiotape therapy session supervision purpose . Once consent participate establish identified client detail pass research team randomisation . Participants randomly allocate one two arm ( 'letter ' 'no letter ' ) use GraphPad ( 2005 ) computer randomisation software package . Randomised participant offer 8-session course CAT . The CAT deliver one three trainee clinical psychologist final year training , one researcher . All trainee complete two-day introductory CAT workshop , addition standard clinical psychology training date . To minimise therapist effect participant arm equally distribute among team . All participant receive eight session CAT follow-up appointment eight week post-therapy . Assessment take place initial two session follow reformulation session three . At reformulation stage 12 patient ( 'letter ' arm ) receive reformulation letter provisional sequential diagrammatic reformulation line standard CAT practice . 12 patient ( 'no letter ' arm ) receive SDR without reformulation letter session 3 . The remain intervention termination procedure follow standard CAT procedure . Patients arm receive , invited produce , goodbye letter termination . All participant invite attend follow-up session eight week post-therapy . To ensure model adherence therapy session tap supervision purpose review CAT qualify , supervisor-trained supervisor . A minimum one full tap session therapist assess model adherence supervisor use CCAT . In addition , tap excerpt session routinely review supervision ; therapist invite employ CCAT self-reflective tool preparation . Issues non-adherence consider training implication , representative area improvement address via standard supervisory procedure . Non-adherence preclude data inclusion purpose research ; rather address limitation study related therapist experience . Data Analysis To allow comparison two active study arm primary outcome variable relevant hypothesis subject analysis use ANOVA . Trend analyse additionally conduct session-by-session data highlight compare pattern change within study arm time . On pre-post data assessment clinical reliable change arm calculate compare use Reliable Change Index ( RCI ; Jacobson &amp; Truax , 1991 ) . Outcome data PHQ9 use calculate reliable change index ( RCI ; Jacobson &amp; Truax , 1991 ) . This identify reliable clinically significant change small ( z &gt; 1.96 , p &lt; .05 ) , medium ( z &gt; 2.58 ; p &lt; .01 ) , large ( z &gt; 3.29 , p &lt; .001 ) effect size . Power analysis suggest sufficient power Between x Within Subjects ANOVA , pay particular attention Groups x Time-Points interaction effect . Assuming 'medium ' effect size f = .25 , significance level alpha = .05 , 2 group participant provide data four time point ( pre , reformulation , post , follow ) propose total sample size 24 give 80 % power . Power analysis also suggest sufficient power conduct trend analysis form ANOVA investigate pattern change time ( session-by-session data ) . Assuming 'medium ' effect size f = .25 , significance level alpha = .05 , 2 group participant provide data eight time point ( session-by-session data exclude follow ) propose sample size 24 give 95 % power . Hypotheses Clients receive reformulation letter : 1 . Display enhance therapeutic alliance comparison client receive CAT without letter . 2 . Perceive therapy helpful comparison client receive CAT without letter . 3 . Achieve good outcome ( great symptom amelioration ) comparison client receive CAT without letter .</detailed_description>
