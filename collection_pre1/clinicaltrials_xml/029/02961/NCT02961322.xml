	<brief_title>Medico-economic Study Lobo-isthmectomy Assisted Robot</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over 50,000 thyroidectomy perform year France . The externally surgery produce satisfactory result , nevertheless remain risk complication order 10 20 % . Moreover , patient operate traditional externally basi-cervical visible scar major concern many . The team Montpellier University Hospital pioneer use technique endoscopic thyroidectomy robotic assistance save totally cervical scarring patient , also decrease rate complication . This technique base use da Vinci robotic system justify , depend manufacturer scientific literature , minimally invasive character , amplitude great movement hand man , movement call intuitive reduce tremor instrument operation ( Patel 2008 ) . In France Europe , grow demand patient surgeon access surgical technique . An assessment real specific cost technique overall management essential order assess financial impact introduction surgery hospital , data available Literature . The main objective study describe direct medical cost treatment thyroid Lobo-Isthmectomy Robot-Assisted ( LIRA ) follow-up 12 month . The secondary objective research determine rate laryngeal paralysis , rate complication specific access axillary robot , size incision make surgery , number channel conversion transaxillary assist robot traditional externally , assess satisfaction patient scar , pain time , evolution potential disorder sensitivity anterior chest wall , vocal functional suite quality life self-administered questionnaire ( Voice handicap Index VHI 10 Short Forme SF-36 ) , finally compare cost care robot average cost conventional surgery .</detailed_description>
