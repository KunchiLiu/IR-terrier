	<detailed_description>Background : Overweight obesity key modifiable risk factor prevention management type 2 diabetes , dyslipidemia , hypertension , CVD certain cancer . Low-GI dietary pattern show improve body weight , among risk factor include glycemic control blood lipid , associate risk reduction type 2 diabetes CVD . Current clinical practice guideline suggest replacement high GI food low GI food improvement glycemic control cardiovascular risk factor . Pasta important example food lower GI diet , property exploit extensively study low GI dietary pattern . However , unclear whether pasta part low-GI dietary pattern improve measure global adiposity , include body weight addition marker adiposity . Need review : The lack high quality knowledge syntheses support evidence-based dietary guidance pasta represent urgent call strong evidence . A systematic review meta-analysis randomize controlled trial remain `` Gold Standard '' evidence support clinical practice guideline public health policy . By pool totality available evidence , systematic review meta-analyses randomize controlled trial would provide best estimate effect pasta measure global adiposity relevant prevention management overweight obesity . Objectives : To provide evidence-based guidance public health policy , health claim , nutrition guideline relate pasta part low GI dietary pattern , investigator conduct systematic review meta-analysis randomize controlled trial assess effect past part low GI diet marker global adiposity , include body weight addition others well regional marker adiposity demonstrate clinical relevance . Design : The planning conduct propose meta-analyses follow Cochrane handbook systematic review intervention . The reporting follow Preferred Reporting Items Systematic review Meta-Analyses ( PRISMA ) guideline . Data source : MEDLINE , EMBASE The Cochrane Central Register Controlled Trials search use appropriate search term . Study selection : Randomized controlled trial investigate effect pasta part low GI dietary pattern body weight marker adiposity human include . Trials less 3 week diet duration , control group , include pregnant woman , breast feeding woman child , report data marker body weight exclude . Data extraction : Two independent investigator extract information study design , sample size , subject characteristic , GI/GL diet , follow-up , composition background diet . Mean ± SEM value extract outcomes . Standard computation imputation use derive miss data . Risk bias assess use Cochrane Collaboration risk bias tool . Outcome : The primary outcome mean difference body weight global marker adiposity demonstrate clinical relevance . Secondary outcome mean difference marker global adiposity clinical relevance include BMI percentage body fat , well regional marker adiposity clinical relevance include waist circumference , waist-to-hip ratio , sagittal abdominal diameter , visceral adipose tissue [ VAT ] image modality . Data synthesis : Pooled analysis conduct use Generic Inverse Variance method . Separate analysis conduct child adult . Analyses stratify metabolic phenotype ( normal weight , overweight/obese , metabolic syndrome criterion , diabetes , etc. ) . Random-effects model use even absence statistically significant between-study heterogeneity , yield conservative summary effect estimate presence residual heterogeneity . Fixed-effects model use &lt; 5 included study . Paired analyse apply crossover trial . Heterogeneity test Cochran Q statistic quantify I2 statistic . Sources heterogeneity explore sensitivity subgroup analyse . If ≥ 10 trial comparison , priori subgroup analysis also conduct dose ( &lt; 100g/day , ≥100g/day ) , comparator , follow-up ( &lt; 6-months , ≥6-months ) , baseline body weight ( BMI ≤25 &gt; 25kg/m2 ) , design ( parallel , crossover ) , energy balance ( negative , neutral , positive ) , GI ( absolute level [ ≤55 , &gt; 55 ] , within-treatment change , between-treatment change ) , fat intake ( absolute level [ &lt; 30 % , ≥30 % energy ] , within-treatment change , between-treatment change ) , carbohydrate intake ( absolute level [ &lt; 50 % , ≥50 % energy ] , within-treatment change , between-treatment change ) , protein intake ( absolute level [ &lt; 20 % , ≥20 % energy ] , within-treatment change , between-treatment change ) , dietary fibre intake ( absolute level [ &lt; 25g/day , ≥25g/day ] , within-treatment change , between-treatment change ) , risk bias . Meta-regression assess significance categorical continuous subgroup analysis . Non-linear relationship assess spline curve modeling ( MKSPLINE procedure ) ass whether threshold benefit . If ≥10 trial comparison , publication bias assess inspection funnel plot Egger Begg test . In presence significant publication bias , adjustment funnel plot asymmetry attempt use Duval Tweedie trim-and-fill method . Evidence Assessment : The strength evidence outcome assess use Grading Recommendations Assessment , Development Evaluation ( GRADE ) . Knowledge translation plan : Results disseminate traditional mean interactive presentation local , national , international scientific meeting publication high impact factor journal . Innovative mean webcasts e-mail feedback mechanism also use . Knowledge Users act knowledge broker network among opinion leader different adopter group increase awareness stage . Four Knowledge Users also participate directly member nutrition guideline committee . Target adopter include clinical practice , public health , industry , research community , patient group . Feedback incorporate use guide analyse improve key message stage . Significance : The propose project aid knowledge translation relate role pasta part healthy low-GI-dietary pattern health outcome strengthen evidence-base guideline improve health outcome , educate healthcare provider patient , stimulate industry innovation , guide future research design .</detailed_description>
