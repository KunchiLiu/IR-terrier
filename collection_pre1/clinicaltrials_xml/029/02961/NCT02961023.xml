	<detailed_description>Pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) characterise increase pulmonary vascular resistance ( PVR ) elevation pulmonary artery pressure ( PAP ) rest , rise markedly exercise . Traditionally , exercise limitation attribute impaired right ventricular ( RV ) function inability heart increase stroke volume ( SV ) response exercise . Disease target therapy improves SV reduce PVR therefore afterload , combination therapy superior regard . Despite advance medical therapy , patient remain symptomatic treatment . The 2014 UK PAH national audit demonstrate 65 % failure rate monotherapy 2 year . This lack improvement exercise tolerance suggest additional mechanism poor SV responsible exercise limitation . There consequently need new treatment strategy improve morbidity mortality PAH . Over past decade , demonstrate exercise training PAH improve exercise capacity quality life ( QOL ) . Exercise train show result significant improvement exercise capacity QOL majority pharmacological therapy , reassure safety health economics . Currently , exercise therapy part standard care UK many European country . There several unanswered question pose barrier widespread implementation ; fall three main domain : A . Relationship drug therapy The standard PAH care move towards combination therapy . In previous study assess effect exercise therapy , half patient monotherapy . No study exclusively assessed effect exercise training addition optimal PAH therapy . B . Health care set The strong support evidence exercise training effective therapy PAH originate single centre Germany , long establish , dedicate cardiopulmonary rehabilitation hospital . These facility exist many country include UK . It unclear whether result replicate outwith robust rehabilitation infrastructure . Data centre utilise exist , less intensive outpatient rehabilitation program show less certain benefit C. Mechanistic information Limited data exist explain beneficial effect exercise train PAH . There number pathophysiological pathobiological process PAH may impair exercise response . These factor study relation effect exercise training . In order best prescribe PAH specific training programme , essential underlie mechanism improve exercise capacity fully understand ; dictate content , duration intensity exercise . It likely affect factor list : 1 . Peripheral muscle structural functional change In idiopathic PAH ( IPAH ) , reduction peripheral skeletal muscle capillarisation , oxidative enzyme capacity , shift type I II fibre , high potential anaerobic capacity compare aerobic capacity reduce function number mitochondria . Importantly , change correlate exercise capacity independent severity pulmonary haemodynamics , suggest mechanism atrophy affect low cardiac output . 2 . Autonomic dysfunction A high rest heart rate ( HR ) , reduced heart rate recovery ( HRR ) , reduce HR variability ( HRV ) evidence alter baroreceptor sensitivity ( BRS ) support autonomic dysfunction PAH . These finding independent haemodynamic severity correlate peak oxygen uptake ( VO2 ) 3 . Respiratory muscle strength Inspiratory expiratory muscle strength reduce IPAH , independently haemodynamic severity , lead reduced ventilatory capacity . Specific respiratory muscle train show important component exercise training programme . 4 . Direct myocardial effect In animal model , exercise training reduces RV hypertrophy pulmonary artery remodelling , suggest direct effect pulmonary vasculature myocardium . Exercise training patient stable PH treatment improve cardiac index reduce mPAP . In rat stable monocrotaline induce PAH , exercise trained rat increase capillary density cardiomyocytes improved exercise endurance compare sedentary match control . 5 . Micro-RNAs ( miRs ) Systemic angiogenic defect contribute skeletal muscle microcirculation rarefaction exercise intolerance , independently haemodynamic severity . Reduction expression pro-angiogenic miR-126 skeletal muscle human PAH correlate capillary density peak VO2 significantly reduce compare healthy control . In PAH rat model , miR126 regulation reduces capillary density correlate exercise capacity . In health , change expression miRs miR-20a correlate change VO2 follow exercise training . 6 . Cytokines Inflammatory cytokine may contribute proteolysis damage contractile protein involve skeletal muscle function . Cytokines interleukin ( IL ) -6 , IL-8 , IP-10 monokine induce interferon-γ ( MIG ) elevate serum IPAH patient . In chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension ( CTEPH ) , IP-10 negatively correlate cardiac index 6mwd . In left ventricular failure , cytokines TNF-alpha reduce exercise training correlate improve exercise capacity . Currently PAH specific exercise rehabilitation programme exist UK . A survey patient willingness participate program mirroring successful protocol use Germany conduct Scottish National Centre Pulmonary Hypertension . 224 patient PAH match inclusion criterion Grunig et al contact . 43 % ( 97/224 ) respond survey , 61.9 % ( 60/97 ) interested component rehabilitation program . A 11.3 % ( 11/97 ) interested outpatient rehabilitation . It highly likely program would benefit PAH population give demand . Aims 1 . Demonstrate exercise training enhance exercise capacity QOL undertaken addition optimal therapy PAH UK set . 2 . Determine mechanisms exercise limitation factor improve training , assess : i. Cardiac function ii . Peripheral muscle structure function iii . Autonomic function iv . Respiratory muscle strength v. Inflammatory cytokine miRNA Original hypothesis 1 . Supervised exercise training patient stable PAH improve exercise capacity , quality life right ventricular ejection fraction . This change occur improved RV function , enhance skeletal respiratory muscle strength function associate improvement autonomic response . 2 . Exercise training affect control mechanisms skeletal muscle structure function . Improvements due change inflammatory cytokine profile expression miRs associate angiogenesis , myogenesis inflammation .</detailed_description>
