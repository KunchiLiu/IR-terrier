	<detailed_description>Background Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ( PCVs ) substantially reduce burden pneumococcal disease . WHO currently recommend give PCVs 3 dose - either 3 dos infancy Pentavalent vaccine ( 3p+0 ) , two dos infancy follow booster around end first year life ( 2p+1 ) . The 3p+0 schedule use many country introduce PCV Gavi support several European country use 2p+1 schedule . However , high price current recommendation least 3 dos achieve full individual protection infant , introduces substantial financial burden . As result , many middle income country yet introduce PCVs , low income country introduce PCVs aid Gavi , Vaccine Alliance , may able sustain PCV vaccination graduate GAVI support . To date PCV program design provide optimal individual protection vaccinee , yet experience develop country indicate herd immunity , generate reduce carriage hence transmission vaccine serotypes community , control vaccine type pneumococcal disease vaccinate unvaccinated individual alike [ 1 ] . Using PCV impact vaccine type carriage marker vaccine type disease [ 2 ] , investigator investigate feasibility reduce number infant dose PCV immunization schedule , make efficient use herd immunity protection pneumococcal disease . Study aim objective Primary objective 1- The investigator measure effect 1p+1 schedule vaccine type pneumococcal carriage non-inferiority compare 2p+1 3p+0 schedule ( ) child age 4-11 month , i.e . age complete primary series age would receive booster dose ( population risk pneumococcal disease likely receive less direct protection reduce primary series ) , ( b ) child age 14-24 month , i.e . age booster dose give treatment arm ( begin age period intense transmission pneumococcus believe occur ) . Secondary objective 1 - The investigator measure effect ( direct + indirect effect ) 0p+1 schedule vaccine type carriage non-inferiority 2p+1 or/and 3p+0 schedule respectively ( ) child age 4-11 month , ( b ) child age 14-24 month , . Secondary objective 2 - The investigator measure effect 1p+1 0p+1 schedule vaccine type carriage non-inferiority 2p+1 3p+0 schedule respectively among unvaccinated mother . Secondary Objective 3- The investigator measure effect catchup vaccination effect community conduct post catchup carriage survey , 4 month second catchup vaccination campaign . Secondary objective 4 - The investigator develop mathematical model predict impact 1p+1 0p+1 schedule vaccine type carriage disease Nha Trang introduce simultaneously cluster follow catch campaign , infer impact schedule transmission setting . Study site : The study conduct 27 commune Nha Trang , central Vietnam capital Khánh Hòa province 400,000 inhabitant . PCV10 recently register Vietnam . However , PCV yet introduce national immunization program Vietnam . Study design : The investigator conduct PCV cluster randomize trial 27 commune Nha Trang city . There four different schedule PCV intervention arm ; 1p+1 , 0p+1 , 2p+1 , 3p+0 schedule . The following PCV schedule investigate study . 0p+1 - A single dose PCV 12 month age 1. p+1 - A two-dose schedule PCV 2 12 month age 2. p+1 - A three-dose schedule PCV 2 , 4 12 month age 3. p+0 - A three dose schedule PCV 2 , 3 4 month age Communes consider cluster . Six cluster intervention arm 3 cluster unvaccinated arm include study . Selection PCV study : PCV10 recently register Vietnam purchase locally , yet case PCV13 . Therefore investigator decide use PCV10 study . Pneumococcal carriage survey : Nasopharyngeal sample collect catchup vaccination annually 60 subject per age group ( 4-11mth , 14-24mth ) mother . The investigator include 6 cluster intervention arm . Sixty subject recruit 3 age group ( 60 child 4 11 month old , 60 child 14 24 month old 120 mother ) cluster achieve primary study objective , accumulates 6480 sample cross sectional pneumococcal carriage survey . Our carriage survey Nha Trang among healthy child well hospitalize child admit acute respiratory infection find similar serotype coverage PCV10 PCV13 ( ~65 % health ~70 % ARI child respectively ) [ 3 ] . Number cluster sample size calculate base Hayes Moulton [ 4 ] . Selection intervention commune : The 3 commune north ; Vinh Luong , Vinh Phuong , Vinh Hoa select unvaccinated commune base geographical background . Although consider commune control study , inclusion unvaccinated commune provide information potential year year carriage due introduction new strain outside Nha Trang vaccinate commune Nha Trang . The remain 24 commune randomize 4 arm : 2p+1 arm , 3p+0 arm , 1p+1 arm , 0p+1 arm . There 8 rural 19 urban commune Nha Trang City . Two rural commune one urban commune select unvaccinated cluster 6 rural 18 urban commune leave randomization . Initial catchup vaccination : catch vaccination campaign do start PCV vaccine introduction . Three dos PCV10 administer child 2 - 6 month age interval 2 month first second , 7 month second third dos . A catch two dos PCV10 administer child 7 18 month age interval two month two dos . Children 19 36 month age receive single dose . This expected quickly control circulation vaccine serotypes area . The total number child less 3 year age 24 commune estimate approximately 18,000 ( 750 x 24 ) . The total number vaccine dos require estimate 30,000 dos . PCV introduction birth cohort child : There 4 PCV intervention schedule ; 2p+1 arm , 3p+0 arm , 1p+1 arm , 0p+1 arm study . The child receive PCV base cluster/communes reside . This PCV vaccination work start one month initial catchup vaccination campaign . Based current census data , investigator estimate birth cohort child commune 250 total 6000 child vaccinate per year 24 treatment commune . Vietnam National Immunization Program vaccinate DPT-HepB-Hib vaccine 2 , 3 , 4months JE vaccine 12 month . The investigator vaccinate PCV visit vaccine . Sample collection testing : Nasopharyngeal sample collect study subject . The initial screening test conduct Nha Trang Pasteur Institute . DNA extract nasopharyngeal sample screen S.pneumoniae lytA gene realtime PCR assay . The positive sample culture , DNA extract DNA sample transport MCRI serotype determination Microarray assay . Already standardized protocol use test [ 5 ] . Approach data analysis : To address primary objective secondary objective 1 , 2 &amp; 3 conduct annual cross sectional nasopharyngeal carriage survey test 60 child 4 11 month old , 60 child 14 24 month old mother cluster presence vaccine serotype carriage 27 commune Nha Trang . The comparison baseline post-catchup vaccination carriage survey reveal effect catchup vaccination child &lt; 3 year age initial vaccination community . The comparison carriage prevalence intervention/treatment ( 1p+1 0p+1 ) cluster gold standard ( 2p+1 3p+0 ) cluster respectively allow age-group specific assessment non-inferiority 1p+1 0p+1 schedule compare 2p+1 3p+0 schedule respectively regard protection vaccine type carriage . Mathematical model analysis : Furthermore use acquire data fit dynamic metapopulation model pneumococcal transmission observe change pneumococcal carriage 27 study commune . The estimated model parameter use predict impact PCV scenario PCV introduce use 1p+1 0p+1 schedule 27 commune . We also use framework infer impact continuation 1p+1 0p+1 schedule transmission setting PCVs use high quality allow model calibration ( secondary objective 4 ) . Severe adverse event monitoring : Preventive medicine center Nha Trang responsible monitoring SAE/AE related routine national vaccination program Nha Trang collaborate support PCV relate SAE monitoring activity . Timeline : The investigator already receive ethical approval Nagasaki University , Nagasaki National Institute Hygiene Epidemiology , Hanoi . Ministry Health , Vietnam approval also obtain September 2016 . 2016 , November : Initial carriage study , follow yearly carriage survey month every year 4 year . 2016 December : First catchup vaccination ( second third catchup vaccination follow 2 month first dose 7 month second dose ) 2017 January : Start PCV introduction 24 commune different schedule base cluster allocation . This PCV introduction 4 year . 2017 , April : Post-catchup carriage survey Annual cross sectional carriage survey conduct month baseline carriage survey 2017 , 2018 , 2019 respectively .</detailed_description>
