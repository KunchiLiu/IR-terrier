	<brief_summary>Questionnaires frequently use online research , however recruiting , completion rate online participant variety culture demographic background challenge . The challenge great online cohort way observe participant beyond contributed online . Poor recruit completion result underpowered research may representative sample population . This trigger increase cost recruitment period may extend sample size reach . When recruit completion rate inadequate study may terminate answer research question remain unknown . To mitigate challenge , incentive may offer form gift certificate draw . There uncertainty whether strategy effective online research value incentive alters outcome . A randomised trial use test intervention establish evidence base . This study ( SupMatQT ) propose link large 20,000 person international cohort study ( SupMat ) test utility preference journal supplementary material reviewer , author , reader . The research describe examine evidence effect offer prize draw incentive rate recruitment , completion consent participant . All participant enter draw . Information value incentive prize draw differ accord group participant randomize . The entry prize draw conditional level participation group allocation . The question researcher address effect survey reminder outcomes ? All non-responders send initial reminder complete survey ( Group A ) still respond second reminder send 14 day later ( Group B ) . Outcomes compare three time point : initial response , follow reminder 1 ( Group A ) , follow reminder 2 ( Group B ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Role Supplementary Material Journal Articles research collaboration BMJ , University Oxford , Queen 's University Belfast research team aim explore usage pattern supplementary material journal article author , peer reviewer , reader compare author , peer reviewer reader response material . The large cohort provide unique opportunity conduct methodology research online participant use nested cohort study define study within trial ( SWAT ) . The nested study `` The Role Supplementary Material Journal Articles Questionnaire Study `` explore effect recruitment survey completion prize draw participant include invitation letter . Large research population struggle recruit participant obtain complete data . This direct effect robustness finding undermine often substantial investment , participant , researcher , sponsor make research . This research waste may undermine public trust community enthusiasm research process . It may seem logical offer prize-winning draw incentive trial give objective information well intervention work . It cost effective embed research begin exist large cohort study funding may available test intervention stand alone question . The additional question interest address ask whether one survey reminder two effective term recruitment survey completion rate . The question practical ineffective reminder use researcher resource , increase burden participation participant could build resentment respondent feel `` spammed '' whereas ideal balance reminder result increase recruitment survey completion rate . Participants cohort draw convenience sample BMJ Publishing Group 's journal spread Impact Factors , include BMJ . Included journal website publish supplementary material . Devoting time resource understand strategy mobilize participant remain motivated join study complete condition good planning contributes robust method researcher replicate . To investigator ' knowledge , similar work conduct solely within online population reader , peer reviewer author academic journal group . The aim study test effect : 1 . Being tell enter prize draw versus tell survey recruitment completion rate across three survey ( author , reader , reviewer ) 2 . Entering participant prize draw different value monetary incentive survey recruitment completion rate across three survey ( author , reader , reviewer ) 3 . Sending two survey reminder incentive group survey recruitment completion rate across three survey ( author , reader , reviewer ) The research question ( ) research explore , effect knowledge enter prize draw rate recruitment completion study vary value incentive influence outcome . The study describe rate differ author , reviewer , reader . The second question one v two reminder influence recruitment completion rate . Participants ( author , reviewer , reader ) invite take part study randomize one five trial arm : All potential participant non-responders receive one reminder complete survey ( Group A ) , For still non-responders initial reminder follow additional reminder 14 day later ( Group B ) Group one receive information within invitation letter enter prize draw win 100 % Amazon gift certificate currency equivalent . Group two receive information within invitation letter enter prize draw win 75 % Amazon gift certificate currency equivalent . Group three receive information within invitation letter enter prize draw win 50 % Amazon gift certificate currency equivalent . Group four receive information within invitation letter enter prize draw win 25 % Amazon gift certificate currency equivalent . Group five receive information prize draw Amazon gift certificate invitation letter .</detailed_description>
