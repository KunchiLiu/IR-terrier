	<brief_summary>Rationale : Previous review show evidence regard effectiveness sacral neuromodulation ( SNM ) patient therapy-resistant , idiopathic ( slow-transit ) constipation suboptimal quality . Furthermore , estimate cost cost-effectiveness patient group . Objective : The main objective study ass effectiveness SNM compare personalize conservative treatment ( PCT ) , patient idiopathic slow-transit constipation refractory conservative treatment . The secondary objective assess 1 ) cost , 2 ) cost-effectiveness 3 ) budget-impact SNM compare PCT . Hypothesis : Based previous research hypothesize SNM effective PCT term significantly high proportion patient treatment success 6 month . Study design : An open-label pragmatic randomize control trial ( RCT ) combine prospective cohort study . Study population : Adolescent ( 14-17 year ) adult ( 18-80 year ) patient idiopathic slow-transit constipation refractory conservative treatment . Intervention : The intervention SNM , minimally invasive surgical procedure consist two phase . In screen phase electrode insert near third sacral nerve connect external stimulator . If screening phase successful ( average defecation frequency ( DF ) ≥3 week ) , electrode connect pacemaker implant buttock patient . If successful , patient receive conservative treatment . The control intervention PCT . This best least invasive alternative SNM . PCT consist medication and/or retrograde colonic irrigation . Main study parameters/endpoints : The primary outcome success 6 month , define average DF ≥3 week accord 3-week defecation diary . Secondary outcome strain , sense incomplete evacuation , constipation severity , fatigue , constipation specific generic ( health-related ) quality life ( ( HR ) QOL ) , cost 6 month . Furthermore , cost-effectiveness budget-impact estimate .</brief_summary>
