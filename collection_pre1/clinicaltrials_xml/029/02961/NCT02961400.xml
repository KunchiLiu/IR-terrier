The early study text message intervention indicate approach enjoyable participant positive effect across range domain treatment type . Hence , study test whether text message contain reminder content session improve treatment outcome . Two text message method also test . One send text message remind participant goal ( PUSH condition ) second send text message remind participant recall goal ( PULL condition ) . This study conduct within context NICHD-funded Randomized Controlled Trial ( grant number R01-HD071065 ; protocol registration ID NCT01828320 ) . In R01-HD071065 adolescent age 10-18 ( n = 176 ) receive either Transdiagnostic Sleep Circadian Intervention ( TranS-C ) Psychoeducation ( PE ) . At 6-month follow-up assessment R01-HD071065 , participant randomize use 3 ( PUSH text message , PULL text message , text message ) x 2 ( TranS-C PE ) design . At 6-month follow-up assessment , questionnaire also administer establish baseline memory treatment . Participants send text message per week return 12 month follow-up assessment R01-HD071065 . At 12 month follow-up assessment , participant ask complete memory treatment questionnaire complete 6 month follow-up assessment well questionnaire evaluate acceptability text message reminder . This research first step toward identify whether inexpensive ubiquitous technology ( i.e. , text message ) improve memory treatment .</detailed_description>
