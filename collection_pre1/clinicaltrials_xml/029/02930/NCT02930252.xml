	<detailed_description>Cancer pancreas , gallbladder , bile duct common cause malignant obstruction biliary tree . Patients unresectable tumor dismal prognosis term survival quality life . In case 5-year survival le 2 % palliation , establishment biliary drainage , treatment available . Two type stent routinely use : plastic stent ( PS ) self-expandable metal stent ( SEMS ) . The first generation SEMS uncover recurrent obstruction , frequently cause tumor ingrowth metal mesh , see 16-46 % . Recently , cover SEMS introduce prevent tumor ingrowth . Covered SEMS associate stent occlusion 14 % patient . As expect , frequent cause stent obstruction patient sludge formation . Stent migration , cholecystitis pancreatitis cause obstruction cystic duct pancreatic duct , respectively , suggest occur frequently cover SEMS . To date , however , one randomize trial three comparative study compare cover uncovered SEMS , find non statistically significant trend towards frequent occurrence complication . From initial study compare uncovered covered SEMS , suggest stent patency may longer covered SEMS . However , support evidence superior efficacy cover SEMS lack . In addition , issue safety cover SEMS , well real world effectiveness self conformable SEMS , warrant investigation . In study , Investigators include patient symptom ( jaundice , cholangitis ) due malignant extrahepatic biliary tree obstruction ( pancreatic cancer , cholangiocarcinoma , gallbladder cancer , metastatic lymphadenopathy ) candidate surgical cure either tumor inoperable patient 's poor medical condition due comorbidities and/or advanced age . Patients extrahepatic malignancy diagnostic work still ongoing establish possibility perform curative approach immediately enrol . Patients previously treat plastic stent eligible plastic stent place within 4 week prior enrolment study . The purpose study compare duration stent patency cover vs. uncovered biliary self-expandable metal stent ( SEMS ) place relieve biliary obstruction patient inoperable extrahepatic malignant biliary obstruction . 1 . Primary Aim : To compare duration stent patency cover vs. uncovered biliary SEMS place relieve biliary obstruction patient inoperable extrahepatic malignant biliary obstruction . Secondary Aims : In patient inoperable extrahepatic malignant biliary obstruction manage SEMS : 1 . To evaluate complication rate cover vs. uncovered biliary SEMS 2 . To evaluate quality life intervention cover vs. uncovered biliary SEMS 3 . To evaluate survival patient treat covered vs. uncovered biliary SEMS 4 . To evaluate cost-effectiveness cover uncovered biliary SEMS 5 . To determine predictor survival patient patient inoperable extrahepatic malignant biliary obstruction manage SEMS . 1.1 Primary endpoint - Normalization bilirubin level cholestasis parameter - Absence clinically significant stent occlusion migration prior death patient ( minimum follow-up : 4 month ) define Clinically Significant Occlusion It define occurrence follow item : - The development clinical symptom biliary obstruction cholangitis , accompany jaundice fever require antibiotic treatment , pruritis - Laboratory evidence cholestasis , include elevation conjugate bilirubin ( ≥ 30 % increase bilirubin ) , alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) alanine transaminase ( ALT ) follow stent placement - Imaging finding consistent biliary obstruction Initial stent failure : normalization bilirubin level cholestatic parameter occur immediately SEMS placement . 1.2 Secondary endpoint - Health-related quality life ( HRQL ) ( evaluate monthly ) - Complications ( perforation , haemorrhage , pancreatitis , cholecystitis , cholangitis , stent migration [ duodenal lumen ≥ 1 cm ] , sludge occlusion , severe pain , tumor in- over-growth , infection , haemorrhage , stent fracture shearing , stent cover disruption ) major minor . - Overall survival post stent placement - Quality adjust life year ( QALYs ) - Costs treatment strategy - Occurrence biliary re-intervention , define endoscopic , percutaneous surgical procedure improve biliary drainage stent placement - Procedure time ( stent deployment ) - Technical complication test endoscopic device . Population : The study population include patient symptom ( jaundice , cholangitis ) due malignant extrahepatic biliary tree obstruction ( pancreatic cancer , cholangiocarcinoma , gallbladder cancer , metastatic lymphadenopathy ) candidate surgical cure either tumor inoperable patient 's poor medical condition due comorbidities and/or advanced age . Patients extrahepatic malignancy diagnostic work still ongoing establish possibility perform curative approach immediately enrol . Patients previously treat plastic stent eligible plastic stent place within 4 week prior enrolment study . Materials Fully cover SEMS : Niti-S Biliary ComVi Stent ; Uncovered SEMS : Niti-S ( D type ) stent Sample size calculation : The primary end point study stent occlusion . The number patient group require demonstrate statistically significant difference SEMS patency 80 % power 70 22 % difference,121 17 % difference , 248 12 % difference obstruction rate two group . Estimated sample size 121 17 % difference , 70 22 % difference . With low ( 75 % ) power , 63 patient per treatment group require detect difference 22 % , 108 17 % difference 222 12 % difference . This computation base data obstruction percentage report literature . The target enrolment study 70 patient per study arm . Considering time occlusion analysis , total 140 patient detect treatment difference two side 0.05 significance level , 80 % power , true hazard ratio least 1.76 . Treatment data Data storage , management , analysis centralize . An electronic database construct collect data . The program distribute participate center data enter time encounter subject time endoscopy stent placement , follow-up visit , follow-up telephone call . Randomization assignment ( stent type ) cod . Standard operate procedure regularly back data employ facility centrally . Every 6 month compact disk ( CD ) study site data send coordinate center data manger download data merge previously collect study data . Security measure adopt mail CD order avoid possible disclosure privacy : data encrypt transformed number . The data manager remove information regard type SEMS use prior send data statistician . Therefore , data analysis perform statistician blind type stent . Data sheet - Baseline enrolment visit ( Day 0 ) - Follow-up visit ( 1 week , 1 month , 3 6 month stent placement ) - Specific Exams/Tests require Stent placement procedure ( Day 0 ) The patient agree participate sign Patient Consent enrol study ; prior enrolment , investigator provide thorough explanation study procedure . Clinical data ( Form A ) : - patient demographic ( gender , age ) - medical history relate diagnosis history - concomitant medication treatment - endoscopic and/or MRI and/or CT-scan exam confirmation location stent - stenosis ( endoscopic examination could do immediately stent placement procedure ) - liver function test 1 week , 1 month , 3 6 month placement ( Form B ) : - liver function test - concomitant medication treatment - confirmation stent position via supine X-ray - Complications 1. week , 1 month , 3 6 month placement ( Form E ) : HRQL questionnaire Analysis Descriptive statistic , include graphical display , use summarize study variable . The unit analysis patient . For continuous variable , mean , median , standard deviation , percentile , range , box plot histograms generate . For categorical variable , frequency proportion generate . The investigator examine variable determine parametric distributional assumption ( e.g . normality continuous variable ) valid . Differences continuous variable determine parametric test , , appropriate non-parametric test . Differing frequency variable different time within group ( dysphagia score , body weight , etc ) compare test related sample . To address primary aim , difference duration stent patency , Kaplan-Meier method use estimate stent patency group log-rank test use unadjusted comparison group . Then Cox proportional hazard model construct compare time stent occlusion adjust important potential confounders . Stent patency calculate day represent interval time stent insertion time replacement death patient concomitant cholangitis . To address secondary aim , relationship complication rate stent type examine chi-square exact Fisher test . Logistic regression use compare stent complication rate adjust important potential confounders . Health-related quality life ( HRQL ) evaluate paired t-test determine impact stent placement ( i.e . compare baseline HRQL month 3 HRQL ) Student 's -test compare difference HRQL baseline 3 month study group . Linear regression model construct assess HQRL adjust factor stent type . Total direct cost study group compare cost effectiveness model . For analysis Statistical Package Social Sciences software ( SPSS , Inc. Windows use . Adverse event define undesirable experience occur subject clinical trial . All adverse event report spontaneously subject observe investigator staff record . A serious adverse event untoward medical occurrence effect level result death : - life threaten ( time event ) - require hospitalisation prolongation exist patient ' hospitalisation - result persistent significant disability incapacity - new event trial likely affect safety subject , unexpected outcome adverse reaction , lack efficacy , major safety find Withdrawal individual subject Subjects leave study time reason wish without consequence . The investigator decide withdraw subject study urgent medical reason .</detailed_description>
