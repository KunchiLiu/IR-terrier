	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research learn safety tolerability Keytruda® ( pembrolizumab ) combination paricalcitol , without standard chemotherapy patient resectable pancreatic cancer . In study , standard chemotherapy combination Gemzar® ( gemcitabine ) Abraxane® ( nab-paclitaxel ) . Researchers also want learn give study drug surgery may help control disease . The safety drug combination also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Preoperative Pilot Study Assess Safety Immunological Effect Pembrolizumab ( Keytruda® ) Combination With Paricalcitol With Without Chemotherapy Patients With Resectable Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign 1 2 study group base join study . This do one know one group well , , bad . - If Group 1 , receive pembrolizumab paricalcitol . - If Group 2 , receive pembrolizumab , paricalcitol , standard chemotherapy . The first 3 participant enrol Group 1 . After , participant enrol group alternate pattern decide study doctor 15 patient total enrolled per arm . Both study doctor know group assign . Study Drug Administration : All participant receive pembrolizumab vein 30 minute Days 1 22 , paricalcitol vein 15 minute Days 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 , 36 . If Group 2 , also receive gemcitabine vein 30 minute nab-paclitaxel vein 30-40 minute , Days 1 , 8 , 15 . Length Treatment : You may able receive study drug 36 day . You longer able receive treatment disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Study Visits : On Days 1 22 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 7-8 tablespoon ) draw routine biomarker test . On Days 8 , 15 , 29 , 36 , blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw routine test . End-of-Treatment Visit : Within 1 week complete treatment : - You physical exam . - You MRI CT scan . - Blood ( 6-7 tablespoon ) draw routine biomarker test . After treatment , doctor decide eligible surgery . If eligible surgery , sign separate consent document describe surgery procedures risk detail . If eligible surgery , sample tumor remove surgery collect use research test study specific protein may surface tumor . These test may help good understand cancer respond study drug . Follow Up : About 30 day either surgery last dose drug ( surgery ) : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine biomarker test . Follow-Up : Every 4 month first year follow-up visit , every 6 month next 2 year , standard care image blood draw . The result review study staff . Your participation study data collect . However , start new anti-cancer treatment disease get bad follow-up , call every 12 week learn . These call continue withdraw study study end . This investigational study . Pembrolizumab FDA approve commercially available treatment melanoma non-small cell lung cancer . Paricalcitol FDA approve commercially available prevent hyperparathyroidism ( type hormonal disorder ) . Gemcitabine nab-paclitaxel FDA approve commercially available treatment many cancer , include pancreatic cancer . It consider investigational use combination pembrolizumab paricalcitol , combination standard chemotherapy , treat pancreatic cancer . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 30 participant take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
