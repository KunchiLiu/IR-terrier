	<brief_summary>The purpose study examine potential change level pain , quality life ( QoL ) activity daily live ( ADL ) observe transforaminal epidural steroid injection administer conjunction pulse radiofrequency treatment lumbar dorsal root ganglion initial 3 month follow-up period . Safety ( monitor side effect ) treatment determine . The study hypothesis application transforaminal epidural steroid injection ( TFESI ) conjunction pulse radiofrequency treatment ( PRF ) treatment lumbar dorsal root ganglion would increase treatment response PRF thereby provide measurable difference pain score , quality life activity daily live patient suffer chronic lumbosacral radicular pain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Transforaminal Epidural Steroid Injection With Pulsed Radiofrequency Chronic Lumbosacral Radicular Pain Management</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study sample : 120 ( one hundred twenty ) patient diagnose chronic lumbosacral radicular pain elect pain specialist undergo pulsed radiofrequency treatment adjacent lumbosacral dorsal root ganglion ( ) . A patient radicular pain affect one segment one side treat involved segment technique consider single intervention study . 60 ( sixty ) patient ( experimental Celestone group ) undergoing pulsed radiofrequency treatment receive transforaminal epidural injection solution 1 cc Lidocaine 1 % 1 cc Celestone Chronodose around dorsal root ganglion immediately radiofrequency treatment perform . 60 ( sixty ) patient ( control group ) undergoing pulsed radiofrequency treatment receive transforaminal epidural injection solution 1 cc Lidocaine 1 % 1 cc normal saline around dorsal root ganglion immediately radiofrequency treatment perform . Randomization blinding : Patients randomly assign Celestone group ( N = 60 ) control group ( N = 60 ) . The allocation patient either group perform use computer-generated randomization program . Each patient 's randomization number conceal end study patient outcome assessor , independent research coordinator investigator pain clinic . The patient explain know medicine receive study completion . Procedure : The study take place Chaim Sheba TelHashomer Medical Center , Ramat Gan , Israel . Participants recruit hospital 's Pain Management outpatient clinic patient eligible procedure involve pulsed radiofrequency lumbosacral dorsal root ganglion . After receive hospital 's Helsinki approval , P.I . and/or designated staff department approach relevant patient ( line mention inclusion exclusion criterion ) , describe procedure , inform possible adverse event collect inform consent patient interested participate . Consent obtain patient patient 's visit option RF agree upon scheduled future . Eligible patient receive financial reimbursement . It stress prospective subject participation research implication treatment hospital , relationship current healthcare provider . The patient advise may unconditionally revoke consent give time participation without repercussion future care . For first month procedure , patient instruct change previously prescribe analgesic medication . All patient make aware guideline prior study participation . After first month follow-up visit , prescribed dos analgesic increase decreased regard pain intensity patient . Patients increment analgesic medication elect alternative treatment consider treatment failure . Data collect experiment kept secure location shred project 's completion . All information regard patient treatment inside outside project keep utmost confidentiality , respect legal ethical constraint . Patients agree participate study come pre-operative room Pain Department designate time . There monitor , initial intensity pain ( 0 10 ) numerical rating scale ( NRS ) record pre-operative vital sign assess ( e.g.- blood pressure , heart rate , oxygen saturation ) . Each patient complete Roland Disability Questionnaire Oswestry Disability Index score . All syrinx solution inject transforaminal approach prepare prior enter operate room . After patient enter operate room undergo pulse radiofrequency treatment . The patient sign consent procedure . The patient place prone position pillow low abdomen provide easy transforaminal approach . It forbid call name dose medication inject procedure except 1.5cc Midazolam IV give light sedation . Fluoroscopy use identify specific site injection radiofrequency case . After sterile preparation needle insertion area , skin infiltrate 1 % Lidocaine , 22-gauge , 4-in radiofrequency needle 10 mm curve active tip advance fluoroscopic guidance . Anatomic landmarks identify , needle position closely dorsal root ganglion fluoroscopy guidance . The tip needle place dorsal-cranial quadrant intervertebral foramen oblique image , tip position one-third halfway pedicle column antero-posterior image . If intravenous uptake occur , needle reposition intravenous uptake absent epidural flow pattern achieve . If intra-arterial , intrathecal , intradiscal flow identify , procedure abort . After confirmation epidural spread ( use contrast dye ) radiofrequency needle position adjacent appropriate dorsal root ganglion , 1 cc normal saline inject decrease electrical impedance around radiofrequency needle . Then stylet replace radiofrequency probe probe connect radiofrequency generator . Defining final position radiofrequency probe require sensory stimulation ( 50 Hz ) threshold ≤0.5 V , create paresthesia correspond exist distribution patient 's radicular pain . Then two group patient two cycle pulse radiofrequency perform 42°C 120 second . Immediately radiofrequency treatment Celestone group solution 1 cc Lidocaine 1 % 1 cc Celestone Chronodose inject around dorsal root ganglion radiofrequency needle . In control group solution 1 cc Lidocaine 1 % 1 cc normal saline inject . All patient treat accord protocol . If emergency situation occur case unblinding , treatment alter patient consider withdrawn . Such patient proceed conservative interventional management without unblinding . They also continue structured exercise program , patient . After procedure patient take recovery room pain clinic monitor least 30 minute . Vital sign assess immediately post-op recovery room 30 minute , prior discharge . Requests additional analgesia ( Optalgin , etc ) assess . During 30 minute follow entry recovery room patient ask experience number symptom use list adverse event response note record . All patient warn potentially serious complication require immediate evaluation ( e.g . progressive weakness ) . To examine delayed adverse event patient ask select number symptom use list adverse event 72 hour procedure ( patient ask bring complete list symptom follow visit 1 month procedure ) . All patient see follow-up appointment pain treat physician Pain Department Tel HaShomer 1 , 2 3 month follow procedure . Results : The baseline characteristic participate patient collect . Numerical data include age , height , weight , body mass index , total duration pain . Categorical data include sex , diagnosis , coexist medical condition diabetes hypertension , target location , level compromise nerve root ( ) . A comprehensive review statistical analysis data conduct completion study . Changes pain score , report patient via NRS score , analyze procedure 1 , 2 3 month postprocedure . Changes ADL QoL measure use Roland Disability Questionnaire Oswestry low back pain disability scale . Both Roland Disability Questionnaire Oswestry score complete patient procedure 1 , 2 3 month postprocedure . Successful pain relief ( responder ) define either ≥50 % ≥4-point pain reduction NRS ; functional success define either ≥40 % reduction Roland Disability Questionnaire Oswestry Disability Index score . Data analysis carry help package statistical program Win Pepi ( fourth version ) . Categorical continuous data comparison , Chi-squared test ( Fisher 's exact test necessary ) test perform . The outcome data patient measure 4 period time therefore repeat measure analysis variance perform . A P value le 0.05 consider statistically significant .</detailed_description>
