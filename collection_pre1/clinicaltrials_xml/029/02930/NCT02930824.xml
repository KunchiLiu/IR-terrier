	<brief_title>Genotype-supported Versus Conventional Proton Pump Inhibitor Dosing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The efficacy proton pump inhibitor ( PPIs ) highly dependent plasma concentration achieve follow drug administration . All PPIs metabolize part CYP2C19 enzyme , encode highly polymorphic CYP2C19 gene . Depending CYP2C19 genotype , individual classify different metabolizer phenotype : poor metabolizers ( PM , 2 loss-of-function CYP2C19 allele ) ; intermediate metabolizers ( IM , one loss-of-function allele ) ; normal metabolizers ( NM , loss gain-of-function allele ) ; rapid metabolizer ( RM ; one gain-of-function allele ) ultra-rapid metabolizers ( UM , two gain-of function-alleles ) . Genetic variant CYP2C19 know profoundly influence PPI plasma concentration consequently , response PPI therapy . For example , individual classify either RM UM low PPI concentration compare NM loss-of-function ( LOF ) allele carrier , respond poorly PPI therapy , fail respond even PPI dose increase . The investigator hypothesize genotype-supported PPI dose lead well GERD control improvement severity dyspepsia symptom compare conventional dosing . The investigator conduct comparative effectiveness study genotype-supported vs. conventional PPI dosing . Patients present GERD dyspepsia symptom either 1 ) initiate PPI therapy 2 ) continue symptoms current PPI therapy recruit gastroenterology clinic randomize genotype-supported versus conventional PPI therapy management strategy . The investigator integrate individual CYP2C19 genotype information dose decision genotype-supported arm compare change symptom control baseline end study study arm . Given PPI efficacy related PPI exposure metabolizer phenotype , individualize treatment use CYP2C19 genotype-supported dosing expect improve symptom management . The investigator also evaluate patient clinician knowledge attitude pharmacogenetics test physician acceptance genetic information clinical practice . Finally , investigator collect preliminary data potential impact CYP2C19-supported PPI dose adverse event rate .</detailed_description>
