	<brief_title>Acquisition 3D Facial Geometry Patients ' Scheduled Radiotherapy Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current type mask use radiotherapy treatment session patient head-and-neck cancer 'made measure ' method currently employ make invasive case patient ' find particularly unpleasant . Their experience motivate research less invasive potentially accurate technique manufacture . To effectively develop automatic manufacturing pipeline , assess accuracy approach need access CT data cohort patient also accurate ( ground truth ) 3D facial model . Such model acquire minute use hand-held laser scanner .</detailed_description>
