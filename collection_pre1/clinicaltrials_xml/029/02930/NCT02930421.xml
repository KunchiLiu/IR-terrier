	<brief_title>Exercise Training Patients With Mild COPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peripheral muscle mass function impair patient mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . Quadriceps cross-sectional area reduce patient compare control [ 1 ] , particularly dyspnea compare non-dyspneic counterpart smoker control [ 2 ] . Reduced physical activity closely related peripheral muscle mass mild COPD [ 1 ] , suggest early therapeutic intervention need group patient . In addition , reduce quadriceps mass strongly associate quadriceps weakness [ 3,4 ] substantial proportion patient mild COPD ( 28 % ) quadriceps weakness [ 5 ] . Reduced muscle mass resultant muscle weakness contribute limit exercise COPD [ 6-8 ] reduce physical activity , particularly mild disease [ 1 ] . Exercise training ( ET ) widely use patient moderate-to-very-severe COPD improve peripheral muscle function thus exercise capacity quality life [ 9 ] . Unfortunately , effect ET mild COPD currently unclear . A recent systematic review identify three low-quality study different design ( retrospective , one group pre-posttest , one randomize control trial ) [ 10 ] . The author find significant improvement exercise capacity ( effect size 0.87-1.82 ) quality life ( effect size 0.24-0.86 ) compare pretest-posttest data ET usual care . Although result inconclusive indicate additional robust study conduct [ 10 ] , current recommendation initiate ET include even mild disease dyspnea exercise limitation present [ 11 ] . Since peripheral muscle mass function improve ET [ 9 ] , investigator hypothesize statement correct consequently ET increase exercise capacity dyspneic patient mild COPD comparison usual care . Patients enter 8-week ET program 3 day per week supervise exercise training Rehabilitation Physiotherapy Gymnasium . Exercise train include high-intensity endurance train 60-80 % baseline peak work rate strength training upper low limb 3 set 6 repetition 50 % one repetition maximum [ 12,13 ] . Each session 60 min duration , 30 min dedicate cycle exercise . The UC group receive usual outpatient care follow-up . The study require 30 patient per arm detect effect size 0.88 [ 10 ] 5 % significance level 80 % power , allow dropout rate 30 % .</detailed_description>
