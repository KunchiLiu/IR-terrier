	<detailed_description>A multi-centre quasi experimental control pilot study undertaken evaluate 6 month ICT base intervention , PEGASO System , promote healthy habit among adolescent . The study include adolescent four site : England ( UK ) , Scotland ( UK ) , Lombardy ( Italy ) Catalonia ( Spain ) . Participants intervention group test PEGASO ecosystem October 2016 March 2017 comparative group access PEGASO ecosystem . The sample selection carry two stage : first phase , school medium-low socioeconomic level select convenience sample ; second phase class select participation school agreement school principals/ head teacher . A total 525 adolescent participate high school ask participate study intervention comparative group , 2:1 ratio . Consequently , approximately , 350 participant four pilot site test PEGASO platform , whilst 175 comparative group . Decisions appropriate sample size underpinned range consideration , include study 's aim , operational constraint , accuracy survey estimate cost . The PEGASO system base comprehensive Behavior Change Wheel ( BCW ) framework particular Capability-Opportunity-Motivation-Behavior ( COM-B ) system . This provide theoretical grounding content implementation approach behavior change intervention embed within component PEGASO system . The innovative key component PEGASO system behavior recognition system allow detection evaluation participant ' real-time behavior ( collected component PEGASO system ) . While target behavior allow focus intervention specific task participant , link behavior change theory ( Behavior Change wheel ) target behavior ensure via COM-B questionnaire . Participants opportunity choose one target behavior time . When select novel target behavior , participant ask complete COM-B questionnaire . The answer question subset guide component COM-B behavior system adopt target content behavior change intervention . For instance , message framework PEGASO Companion App select message associate participant ' preference express COM-B questionnaire . This provide intervention personalize different need individual intervention participant . To analyze effectiveness platform modify knowledge/awareness behavior investigator compare intervention control group utilize intention-to-treat ( ITT ) approach , thus infer effect independently drop-outs non-adherence . The participant provide smart phone ( android , version 5.0 ) duration study . Two smart garment , smart garment sensor activity bracelet provide month 3 . The smart phone apps PEGASO ecosystem instal . In addition , participant ask join PEGASO community sign PEGASO Portal ( http : //portal.PEGASOf4f.eu/web/others/sign-in ) . PEGASO comprise seven different apps . The objective PEGASO Companion app encompass six apps provide seamless unique experience participant . Companion App . The aim Companion App make active life attractive , help participant eat healthily connect participant peer . Developed native Android application ( client + server ) , Companion Personal Digital `` Friend '' act daily-life guide coaching , caring , empower participant activity toward healthy habit . The Companion App allow user dynamic stream information ( achievement achievements user choose connect user within PEGASO system ) access application . Data acquire via sensor ( embed Smartphone garment ) present user via specific interface develop inside Health Companion App . The Companion App also include reward system gamification module allow system : achieve One time reward , achieve Cyclic event achieve Rewards ( e.g. , fit coin , badge , experience point ) select target behavior ( diet physical activity ) . Challenges app . The Companion app include `` challenge '' component participant use create accept different type challenge . This application allow user challenge user competitive collaborative way . eDiary app . The eDiary application allow participant enter information diet provide feedback healthy eat habit . This app also provide suggestion ( e.g. , food group recipe ) user improve dietary habit . The eDiary app gamified order improve participant ' experience introduce element fun sustain engagement app eat habit . PEGASO City app . The PEGASO City bridge digital world PEGASO system physical world . The app twofold role inside PEGASO Health Companion : firstly , PEGASO City help teenager find place part PEGASO Stakeholder Ecosystem , provide opportunity act healthy progress towards reach target behavior . Secondly , empowerment provide integration HealthSquare functionality , application provide teenager set possible interaction action contribute gamification process reward system . Dashboard app . The Dashboard application allow see data acquire PEGASO system . The app show activity data step minute activity , sleep time , type activity make course day ; addition , report user reach target behavior award him/her badge trophy . Thanks Dashboard participant able check behavior perform reflection self-monitoring extract suggestion apps . Users also control battery memory status PEGASO device . Smart Garments bracelets sensor . Smart garment consist t-shirt/crop top embed textile electrode . The t-shirt/crop top come data logger ( monitoring/recording system ) snap front side t-shirt use standard snap button . The smart garment measure heart rate ( ECG ) physical activity ( accelerometer ) whereas bracelet monitor physical activity sleep . Data collect garment bracelet transfer smart phone link Health Companion app well serious game . Participants provide User Manual local language . Serious game . The game serve central role motivational component PEGASO . As , need entertain engage player , whilst utilize PEGASO ecosystem capture information lifestyles encourage positive health behavior change . There two central behavioral mechanism within game : ) `` energy bar '' , use player 's action game , replenish achieve behavioral goal increase physical activity improve diet , b ) game implement `` research '' mechanic require player apply develop nutritional knowledge various food source . The current game format infinite game , energy mechanic , promote regular use goal-achievement within PEGASO ecosystem , well conducive short , frequent play rather long single session . PEGASO Web Portal . The PEGASO Web Portal allow participant socially interact learn via training module ; two ( technological ) : aggregate data service across whole PEGASO platform ( image , video , blog material , activity data , . step , . km ) . Potentially user PEGASO Portal teenager , parent expert . The Web portal accessible mobile device computer . Report App . The connection PEGASO ecosystem personal health folder establish BRIDGE system deploy test two pilot site : namely Lombardy region Catalonia . The BRIDGE allow extract health data collect elaborated PEGASO ecosystem create report share physician personal health folder ( PHF ) . Chi-squared test use analyze association independent qualitative variable , along McNemar test pair sample . The Student t-test use comparison mean two group , pair t-test applied ass change within one group . Alternatively , correspond nonparametric test use , require . The relationship quantitative variable analyze use Pearson 's correlation coefficient Spearman coefficient case asymmetrically distribute variable . Multivariate linear regression analysis logistic regression analysis use analyze variable determine change physical activity eat sleep habit . In order analyze effect intervention , comparison make change observe comparison group ( CG ) versus intervention group ( IG ) , estimation Cohen statistic , adjust variable may influence result . A multilevel analysis perform determine effect different pilot site school . The effect intervention could modify gender , cultural socioeconomic level , body mass index ( BMI ) , well baseline lifestyle , control analysis . Separate analysis also perform female , male , low high socio-economic level ass effect intervention category interest . The level statistical significance set Î±=0.05 test two-tailed . Statistical analysis carry use software package SPSS , version 22.0 ( SPSS Inc , Chicago , IL ) Stata ( StataCorp . 2009 . Stata Statistical Software : Release 11 . College Station , TX : StataCorp LP ) . Conversational method use collect data focus group . All audio and/or videotape transcribe systematically , literally , anonymously .
