	<brief_summary>Pressure ulcer severe injury wound cause substantial burden patient , caregiver , healthcare system worldwide . There common agreement , effective pressure ulcer prevention crucial importance maintain skin tissue integrity individual risk . Besides risk assessment reposition use special pressure ulcer preventive support surface key intervention pressure ulcer prevention . Pressure ulcer preventive support surface modify degree skin tissue deformation and/or skin temperature moisture . Therefore , association type work mechanism pressure ulcer support surface skin function load highly likely . Furthermore , relationship may use characterize and/or quantify performance pressure ulcer support surface term skin protection . The overall aim explorative study measure skin response two common pressure ulcer predilection site ( heel , sacral skin ) two hour load three different support surface sternal skin ( control area ) .</brief_summary>
