	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess incidence residual block patient arrive Post Anaesthetic Care Unit ( PACU ) follow surgery , receive neuromuscular block drug ( muscle relaxant ) . Residual block ( decrease motor function ) due residual level muscle relaxant associate increased morbidity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective , cross sectional study . Adult patient undergo surgery main operating theatre Singapore General Hospital require general anaesthesia muscle relaxant enrol assessed 4 month period . Explanation , hand Participation Information Sheet , consent take research take either : In anaesthetic Pre-operative Evaluation Clinic ( PEC ) take place average 1-2 week prior surgery ; On ward , portion patient admitted inpatient day surgery . This allow patient time consider participation study . The conduct anaesthesia arrival PACU leave discretion attend anaesthetist . After arrival PACU , patient care PACU nurse attend anaesthetist . The PI co-investigators participant follow patient arrive PACU fit inclusion criterion i.e . receive muscle relaxant anaesthetic . Participants neuromuscular function monitor use TOF Watch . This neuromuscular monitor use ass twitch height muscle stimulate small electrical current . Assessing neuromuscular function stage anaesthesia ( anaesthesia recovery anaesthesia ) standard care consider `` essential '' per guideline Association Anaesthetists Great Britain Ireland ( 2015 ) . The following standard care PACU patient suspect residual block : 1 . Neuromuscular function assess use clinical mean ( head lift hand grip ) unreliable ( false positive due effect anaesthetic agent opioids rather muscle relaxant ) 2 . Neuromuscular function assess either TOF count ( number twitch ) TOF ratio ( fade height four twitch ) per manufacturer 's guideline . Two ECG electrode place 4 cm apart path ulnar nerve wrist clean skin alcohol swab . The TOF force transducer place volar aspect thumb . The TOF Watch lead attach electrode TOF stimulus apply : four twitch 2Hz ( every 0.5 second ) , twitch last 0.2ms , current 50 milliampere ( mA ) . 3 . Patients residual block closely monitor per standard care PACU , include oxygen therapy , monitoring ( continuous ECG , respiratory rate , pulse oximetry , 15 minutely non invasive blood pressure measurement ) . Those patient clinical sign symptom residual block treat discretion PACU nurse attend anaesthetic medical officer station PACU For research study PACU , patient ( step 1 3 ) irrespective whether residual block suspect . In addition : The TOF ratio measure two set TOF ratio average two take . As far possible , TOF do patient still slightly drowsy effect anaesthesia order minimize patient TOF discomfort . If &gt; 10 % discrepancy two reading two TOF apply , average two close measurement average . This determine participant residual block ( define TOF &lt; 0.9 ) . Medical record review data intraoperative period PACU stay ( usually one hour ) include data already inputted anaesthetic chart : 1 . Patient data : age , weight , BMI , American Society Anaesthesiologists ( ASA ) status , list co-morbidities 2 . Surgical data : type operation duration 3 . Anaesthetic data : type , dose time muscle relaxant reversal use ; type method neuromuscular monitoring use 4 . PACU data : time arrival ; heart rate , blood pressure , pulse oximetry respiratory rate admission ; adverse incident ( airway obstruction , desaturation ( SpO2 &lt; 95 % ) , complaint muscle weakness blurred/double vision ) .</detailed_description>
