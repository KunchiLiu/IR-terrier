	<detailed_description>The major thiol-disulfide couple GSH oxidize glutathione ( GSSG ) crucial regulator main transcriptional pathway regulate aseptic inflammation recovery skeletal muscle follow aseptic injury . Antioxidant supplementation may hamper exercise-induced inflammatory response . The objective examine thiol-based antioxidant supplementation affect immune mobilization follow exercise-induced skeletal muscle microtrauma . In two-trial , double-blind , crossover , repeat measure design , 10 young men receive either placebo NAC ( 20 mg/kg/day ) immediately muscle-damaging exercise protocol ( 300 eccentric contraction ) eight consecutive day . Blood sample performance assessment perform pre-exercise , 2h post-exercise daily 8 consecutive day .</detailed_description>
