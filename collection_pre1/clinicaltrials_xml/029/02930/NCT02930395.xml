	<detailed_description>The possible evolution neuro-vascular damage biological consequence currently overlook . The Head Injury Assessment ( HIA ) current gold standard use national Rugby Medical Authorities accordance international safety protocol . The HIA protocol relies neurological neuropsychological endpoint , potentially subjective ensure sufficient sensitivity . As result , define immediate long-term pathophysiological consequence concussion remain challenge . The introduction objective blood test detect presence evolution overtime neuro-vascular damage could represent pair approach fill sensitive gap management concuss player . Recent evidence propose use serum biomarkers aid post-concussion management . Remarkably , serum biomarkers neuro-vascular function currently use emergency room setting . Serum level brain protein S100β demonstrate excellent negative predictive value neurovascular damage mild traumatic brain injury ( mTBI ) . Measurement blood S100β propose tool grade TBI , limit unnecessary CT scan examination emergency case . However , whether use serum maker neuro-vascular damage could benefit management sport-related concussion remain unclear . Moreover , repeat concussion link increased risk Alzheimer 's disease , Multiple Sclerosis Parkinson 's disease . Serum biomarkers could diagnostic prognostic value , facilitate return play decision predict linger risk cognitive decline .</detailed_description>
