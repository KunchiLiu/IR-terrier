	<brief_summary>The new definition sepsis ( sepsis 3.0 ) restrict early diagnosis sepsis general ward . Despite alternative process use simplify qSOFA score , many patient may still leave . Whether patient matter unknown . This prospective cohort include patient ten general ward high incidence infection consecutive half year , obtain qSOFA SOFA score , follow prognostic data , therefore compare patient different group , eventually evaluate diagnostic accuracy qSOFA score diagnosis sepsis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>qSOFA General Wards : Accuracy Diagnosis Sepsis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The sepsis , consider multi-organ dysfunction induce infection , one lead cause death hospital . In 2016 , third international consensus modify definition sepsis infection &gt; =2 systemic inflammatory response syndrome ( SIRS ) criterion infection &gt; =2 sequential organ failure assessment ( SOFA ) score . This new definition , well reflect organ dysfunction nature sepsis , however make difficult diagnose sepsis general ward . An alternative process put forward compensate weakness . For infection patient general , access quick SOFA ( qSOFA ) , 2 score , conduct laboratory examination get SOFA score . This process helpful find sepsis , undoubtedly leave patient meet SOFA criterion without qSOFA &gt; =2 . Besides , also patient qSOFA &gt; =2 however meet SOFA criterion . Whether patient well survival rate unclear . This prospective cohort aim compare prognosis patient different SOFA , qSOFA score , therefore access diagnostic accuracy qSOFA diagnosis sepsis , eventually evaluate feasibility use qSOFA complete replacement SOFA general ward .</detailed_description>
