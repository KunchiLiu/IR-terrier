	<brief_summary>Injury knee sport participation often involve partial full detachment anterior cruciate ligament ( abbreviated ACL ) . ACL tear cause pain , swell inflammation . While swell inflammation usually go away time , individual ACL injury may experience pain notice knee instability ( knee slipping , etc. ) . Often surgery repair replace ACL within joint , allow individual ability walk run pain free participate sport . Unfortunately , osteoarthritis knee , also cause pain swelling , occur knee 10-20 year later reason well understood . In research study , investigator hope reduce initial pre-operative pain . The reduction pain allow earlier movement knee joint preparation surgery . The investigator interested see use Kineret decrease risk develop arthritis individual ACL injury treat within 1-7 day injury .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>IL-1RA Treatment Patients With Acute ACL Tear Painful Effusions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Kineret® chosen safe , well tolerate , use treat Rheumatoid Arthritis ( RA ) post-surgical persistent knee effusion well knee stiffness . Although Kineret® approve US Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment RA Neonatal-Onset Multisystem Inflammatory Disease , currently approve FDA use treat ACL injury . Therefore , use Kineret® study investigational . The research procedure conduct University Kentucky ( UK ) Medical Center . Participants need come UK Healthcare Turfland locate 2195 Harrodsburg Road Lexington , KY . Participants ask come location seven time study . Each visit take 30 minute . All exams questionnaire administer otherwise necessary routine visit participant suffer ACL tear . No additional visit necessary . The total amount time commitment participation study 6 1/2 hour , next 2 year . All participant sport related ACL injury enrol study see may elect undergo surgery , necessary . Note : Surgery part protocol . Should participant enrol study choose undergo ACL reconstruction ( surgery ) , receive treatment accord protocol . Randomization : Once determine participant qualifies entry study , randomize , like flip coin one three treatment group . All group receive knee injection either Kineret® saline placebo . The saline placebo contain active medication . Both participant study doctor know treatment group participant assign . However , case emergency , investigator able find treatment group participant assign . - Group 1 : A saline placebo injection Visit 1 Kineret® 150mg Visit 2 . - Group 2 : Kineret® , 150mg Visit 1 saline placebo Visit 2 . - Group 3 : Saline placebo Visits 1 2 . X-rays : All participant would undergo routine clinical x-ray analysis prior Visit 1 . MRI : All participant undergo initial MRI examination confirm ACL injury Visit 1 subsequent MRIs perform Visits 6 7 . Participants undergo knee aspiration . During knee aspiration , investigator remove fluid space around knee use needle syringe . This usually perform local anesthetic either relieve swelling obtain fluid analysis diagnose joint disorder and/or problem . Knee aspiration ACL tear painful effusion common orthopaedic practice standard care UK Medical Center . Thus consider additional intervention regard study unless participant fluid knee . At Visit 1 : Participants may large effusion require aspiration . This would do part participant normal routine care . At Visit 2 : Participants may undergo study require aspiration depend amount fluid knee . This perform purpose research . At Visit 3 : Should participant elect undergo ACL reconstruction surgery , undergo study require knee aspiration . This perform purpose research . At Visit 4 : Should participant elect undergo ACL reconstruction surgery , substantial post-operative fluid knee , investigator may choose aspirate knee . This would do part participant normal routine care . After aspiration procedure : Once home , important participant keep joint aspiration site clean dry . The aspiration site may tender sore day joint aspiration procedure . The investigator instruct participant pain reliever may take . Below breakdown happen study visit : Visit 1 Screening ( 1-7 day follow injury ) - Obtain informed consent assent necessary - Medical history review inclusion/exclusion criterion - Medications history review inclusion/exclusion - Medical examination collect vital sign .All participant must clinical exam consistent ACL tear . - Collection urine blood laboratory test . Women child bear potential give urine pregnancy test . Test must negative order enroll study . - Participant follow assessment : range motion , knee instability ( Lachman 's test ) standardize MTP-2 weight bear x-rays ask fill several questionnaire . - Pre-Surgery MRI Once eligibility determine , participant randomize 1 3 treatment group . Following randomizing , participant undergo knee aspiration receive first dose study medication . Visit 2 ( 10-17 day post injury ) : - Knee aspiration - Study medication injection - Patient report outcome ( PROs ) administer - Pain Questionnaires administer - Biomarkers ( urine , blood ) Visit 3 ( day surgery 4-6 week post injury ) - Knee aspiration ( operate room anesthesia ) - Patient report outcome ( PROs ) administer prior surgery - Pain Questionnaires administer prior surgery - Biomarkers ( urine blood ) Visit 4 ( 2 week post injury ) - Knee aspiration ( clinically indicate ) - Patient report outcome ( PROs ) administer - Pain Questionnaires administer - Biomarkers ( urine blood ) Visit 5 ( 6 month post-op ) - Patient report outcome ( PROs ) administer - Pain Questionnaires administer Visit 6 ( 12 month post op ) - MRI - Patient report outcome ( PROs ) administer - Pain Questionnaires administer - Biomarkers ( serum urine ) Visit 7 ( 24 month post-up ) - MRI - Patient report outcome ( PROs ) administer - Pain Questionnaires administer - Biomarkers ( serum urine ) The blood fluid sample collect participant NOT UNDERGO GENETIC TESTING . Samples analyze store UK research laboratory . The tested special marker cartilage breakdown remain property University Kentucky indefinitely completely use . The result analyze sample important research For reason , result release either participant family . Either participant insurance company , Medicare Medicaid responsible cost care treatment receive study would normally receive condition . The University Kentucky may allow bill insurance company , Medicare Medicaid medical procedure do strictly research . These cost include follow : - X-ray knee do Visit 1 - Knee aspiration do Visit 1 Visit 4 ( necessary ) The University Kentucky may allow bill insurance company , Medicare Medicaid medical procedure do strictly research . The follow provide cost : injection Kineret® , second knee aspiration potentially third knee aspiration , questionnaire three MRIs . Participants receive $ 150.00 take part study . They receive $ 50.00 MRI complete . Payment form check mail approximately four six week follow study visit . If participant child compensation mail child . Should participant decide withdraw study early compensate time travel .</detailed_description>
