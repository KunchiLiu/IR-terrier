	<brief_title>The Challenge Study : A Dietary Personalization Protocol Patients With Crohn 's Disease Deep Remission</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator previously hypothesize Crohn 's disease may occur via sequence event involve dysbiosis genetically determine environmentally acquire defect innate immunity , hypothesize mechanism EEN induction remission act reduce exposure dietary component may cause acquire bacterial clearance defect generate dysbiosis . Based premise , investigator develop new exclusion diet . This diet , name Crohn 's Disease Exclusion Diet ( CDED ) reduce exposure component identify rodent model well two component highly suspect investigated model . This diet evaluated induction remission week 12 succeed induce remission 70 % 47 select patient . The investigator progress three randomize control trial evaluate diet different population different disease severity , result first RCT demonstrate high remission rate CDED arm . However , date investigator use diet patient . The investigator encounter patient diet deep remission , investigator know consume product ( milk fat gluten ) eliminate . The investigator therefore start challenge patient deep remission low dose exposure evaluate low dose exposure harmful . The investigator wish document obtain stool sample calprotetctin microbiome investigate patient microbiological level well .</detailed_description>
