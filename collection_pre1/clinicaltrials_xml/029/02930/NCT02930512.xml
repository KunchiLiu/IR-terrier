	<brief_summary>Studies show patient idiopathic Parkinson 's disease ( IPD ) increase risk fracture , particularly hip fracture whose complication postoperative mortality appear high general population . This increase risk fracture due partly increase risk fall , secondly impairment bone tissue low bone mineral density ( BMD ) . A meta-analysis conclude patient IPD low BMD healthy control . Prospective study also show rapid bone loss patient compare control . The association low BMD IPD seem dependent severity duration disease even data contradictory . Various mechanism may explain bone loss include weight loss , malnutrition low level physical activity . However , enrollment study often weak difficult conclude real impact factor bone loss IPD . The main objective study assess prioritize various bone loss mechanism . Bone assessment `` peripheral quantitative compute tomography '' ( pQCT ) also assess impact various risk factor bone strength parameter . The prevalence vertebral compression fracture IPD , day unknown evaluate . This study also estimate prevalence vertebral compression fracture IPD .</brief_summary>
