	<brief_summary>Peripheral Arterial Disease ( PAD ) highly debilitate disease affect 202 million people around world 7 million people France . Morbi-mortality cardiovascular event increase population . Intermittent claudication common clinical feature PAD . Primary therapeutic approach medical treatment advice walk . Sildenafil , PDEi type 5 , well tolerate , largely used impotence interest clinical delay duration action concept potential use claudication . For patient agree sign informed consent , randomisation treatment ( placebo/sildenafil ) do . Treatment propose addition usual treatment . The experimental drug deliver 1 month treatment . First follow visit month one focus tolerance , compliance eventual side effect . If major side effect find study drug deliver additional 2 month . Patients evaluate month 3 ( second follow-up visit ) persistent non-persistent indication revascularisation address revascularization need . In parallel focus tolerance , compliance eventual side effect do . If major side effect find , study drug deliver additional 3 month treatment .
