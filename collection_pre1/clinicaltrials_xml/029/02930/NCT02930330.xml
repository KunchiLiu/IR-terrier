	<detailed_description>Background : Platelets play important role cardiovascular disease : First , promote development atherosclerotic lesion , second , platelet form vessel occlude thrombi top ( rupture ) lesion , ultimately leading thrombotic event like myocardial infarction ( MCI ) . Whereas acute , strenuous exercise cause platelet activation transiently increase risk MCIs , long-term chronic exercise training result clear reduction platelet activation MCI incidence . Exercise training play key role cardiac rehabilitation , since improvement cardiorespiratory fitness ( CRF ) associate decreased mortality patient . With respect CRF improvement , high-intensity interval training demonstrate effective moderate-intensity continuous exercise . However , beneficial effect high-intensity interval train platelet function patient cardiovascular disease never investigate . Scientific question : The aim study determine effect interval training cardiac rehabilitation platelet function . Hypotheses : Cardiac rehabilitation interval training component ( INT ) reduce 1. platelet activation platelet reactivity physical rest 2. change platelet activation -reactivity induce acute , strenuous exercise great extent cardiac rehabilitation consist exclusively moderate-intensity continuous exercise training ( CONT ) . Work program : 80 patient begin phase II cardiac rehabilitation randomly assign interval group control group . In group , patient exercise 4x / week 12 week . At begin , 6 week end exercise test carry . Blood take ( platelet function rest ) immediately exercise test ( platelet function acute , strenuous exercise ) . Basal platelet activation well platelet responsiveness towards platelet agonist ( platelet reactivity ) analyze .</detailed_description>
