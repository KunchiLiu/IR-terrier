	<brief_summary>Cancer cause 8.2 million death year , estimate worldwide cost $ 895 billion . Pharmacological treatment provide improvement expect survival symptom , cost high rate toxicity increase time spent patient away home family treatment . This particularly important patient advanced disease timeframe stake relate last month life . Sarcopenia ( i.e . loss muscle mass together decrease functional capacity ) widely report important prognostic factor advance cancer , impact survival , toxicity , response treatment patient-centered outcome ( functional capacity , quality life fatigue ) . Sarcopenia term first use 1988 Rosenberg , mean age-related loss skeletal muscle mass function . It derive greek : sarx = flesh penia = loss . In 2010 , European Consensus define sarcopenia triad muscle mass loss , decrease functional performance muscle strength . It report hallmark cancer , impact prognosis , response treatment , side effect chemotherapy recovery surgery . The prevalence sarcopenia advance cancer seem vary accord gender , stage , primary tumor location treatment , present 28 67 % patient . Exercise , particular resistance training , one powerful way increase muscle mass evidence elderly patient suggest among promising intervention sarcopenia . There evidence resistance train effective evidence still scarce patient advanced disease . Historically concern regard safety efficacy oncologic patient , though evidence suggest resistance train one preferred form exercise patient , effectiveness resistance train alone sarcopenia patient advance cancer remain unknown . Another question whether home ( seem patient ' prefer location exercise ) produce good result hospital ( traditional location ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Feasibility Home vs. Hospital Based Resistance Training Advanced Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study hypothesis : Home prefer set resistance training program adults newly diagnose advanced cancer , compare hospital standard care alone . AIM : test feasibility clinical impact home vs. hospital base resistance training program adults newly diagnose advanced cancer , compare standard care . Objective 1 : describe feasibility ( defined acceptability , compliance , recruitment retention ) two intervention model control ; Secondary outcome measure : Objective 2 : test tolerability ( patient ' perception ) safety ( number adverse event due exercise ) ; Objective 3 : explore effect intervention clinical outcome ( muscle mass , treatment related toxicity , strength , functional capacity , quality life , fatigue ) ; Objective 4 : evaluate associate health resource use ( unplanned medical appointment , acute emergency visit hospital admission ) intervention control arm . Study design : investigator design three arm , randomise , open label , phase II trial , advanced cancer patient , compare 1 ) standard treatment concomitant resistance training program home ; 2 ) standard treatment concomitant resistance training program hospital ; 3 ) standard treatment alone . Overall trial start date : 01/05/2016 Overall trial end date : 31/03/2017 Condition : Advanced cancer Interventions : Resistance training home , resistance training hospital</detailed_description>
