	<brief_title>Hemodynamic Study With PRAM Cardiovascular Response Positioning Extraglottic Device</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction Laryngoscopy tracheal intubation may cause significant hemodynamic change patient induce cardiovascular complication . Numerous study seek method reduce risk ( 1-5 ) . The extraglottic involve either laryngoscopy passage vocal cord , proven protective possible cardiovascular complication result placement respiratory prosthesis ( 6,7 ) . Measurements hemodynamic change result procedure airway management extraglottic previously carry . The MostCare ( Vytech , Vygon Italia srl , Padova , Italy ) monitor provide 10 year obstetric gynecological anesthesia unit able evaluate hemodynamic change patient base Pressure Recording Analytical Method ( PRAM ) . This measurement method cardio-circulatory performance patient require calibration / insertion pre-estimated data method analysis wave form arterial pressure develop completely priori ( 8 ) . The measurement derive simultaneous analysis component pulsatile flow continuous flow ratio area curve pulsatile portion systolic pressure characteristic impedance Z ( ) . The PRAM method proven effective many clinical setting ( 9 ) . The Medical Device ( DM ) use accordance indication use acquire CE mark . A morphology detection system link high blood pressure curve detect non-invasive Masimo oximetry system supply Hospital use Purpose study The purpose research record hemodynamic response measure traditional method ( non-invasive blood pressure ECG ) PRAM method patient undergoing placement laryngeal mask compare hemodynamic response measure patient undergo laryngoscopy tracheal intubation perform surgery gynecological area ass difference two method Methods This prospective observational study . Data collect consecutive patient undergo general anesthesia gynecologic surgery period 3 month minimum number 94 patient ( see section statistical analysis ) . In operating room patient undergo active pre-warming hot air , peripheral venous cannulation premedication midazolam 0,04 mg/kg , fentanyl 1.5 mcg/kg body weight . After position standard monitoring system ( ECG , Non-Invasive Blood Pressure , Pulseoximetry , Neuromuscular Transmission ) , signal Pulseoximetry also analyze MostCare monitor system allow apply measure method PRAM noninvasively . After 3 minute high flow O2 , propofol 2 mg/kg body weight rocuronium 0.9 mg/kg body weight administer sequentially patient . Anesthesia maintain propofol continuous infusion ( 9-12 mg/kg body weight /hour ) remifentanil continuous infusion ( 0.2 mcg/kg body weight /minute ) . At disappearance adductor muscle response electrical stimulation thumb `` Train four '' ( TOF ) apply ulnar nerve position maneuver respiratory device perform : - direct laryngoscopy case endotracheal intubation - direct insertion case laryngeal mask placement . Proper placement evaluate chest auscultation , spirometry analysis concentration carbon dioxide curve exhale gas . The data obtain PRAM usual monitoring record special sheet outside observer . In case fail position respiratory device , procedure repeat case failure proceed indicated national hospital guideline ( 10 ) , patient still exclude study .. The choice respiratory device depend type intervention schedule operate program . The hemodynamic monitoring data record every minute 5 minute patient . The study duration 3 month ( case reach minimum number 94 case ) . The patient divide , retrospectively , two group accord type device use airway management . The two group compare basis age anthropometric parameter . An analysis hemodynamic response two group patient position respiratory device conduct . Statistical analysis A recent study ( 11 ) , analyze cardiac index change response tracheal intubation laryngoscope Mcintosh comparison video laryngoscope laryngoscopy , show difference 1 L/min/m2 ( 3.1±0.6 4.3±1.4 laryngoscope McIntosh vs 3.0±0.3 3.2 ± 1.1 videolaryngoscope ) . Therefore , test hypothesis cardiac index difference use airway management traditional intubation compare use laryngeal mask great equal 1 L/min/m2 , fix first type error 5 % study power 80 % , possible calculate sample size need one-tailed test represent 47 patient per group . The average data collect group patient compare Student 's test . Expected result To verify , two homogeneous population group anthropometric clinical data , least impact cardiovascular system produce placement laryngeal mask compare induced endotracheal intubation conventional laryngoscopy take advantage non-invasive hemodynamic monitoring system pulse oximetry MostCare ( methodology PRAM ) ever test field . Also check hemodynamic impact repeat attempt maneuver airway management . Ownership result accredit principal investigator behalf AOU Careggi University Florence head neither receive receive fee conduct study .</detailed_description>
