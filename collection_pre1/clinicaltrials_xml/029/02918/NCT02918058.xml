	<brief_title>Reducing Post-discharge Potentially Inappropriate Medications Amongst Elderly : Multi-centre Electronic Deprescribing Intervention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Deprescribing hospitalization achieve concerted effort expert clinician . A single-centre randomized control trial ( 400 patient ) demonstrate dedicated geriatrician apply STOPP/START criterion [ screen tool old people 's prescription ( STOPP ) screen tool alert right treatment ( START ) ] screen PIM use admission could improve prescribe appropriateness provide recommendation medication management ; change show persist least six month post discharge . Recommendations make 58 % intervention patient , accept great 90 % case . At discharge proportion patient take `` unnecessary '' therapy 20 % control group 5.2 % intervention arm . This study underpowered show meaningful difference ADEs entirely dependent dedicate expert physician whose full time job provide service ; despite , medication discontinue nearly 1 5 patient sustain post-discharge effect . This catalyst program build Canadian Frailty Network-funded Catalyst Research Program Grant ( MEdication RAtionalization MERA ) Co-Investigator James Downar . MERA identify medication deprescribing combine STOPP/START , Beers criterion , Choosing Wisely Canada recommendation . A multidisciplinary case team guide elderly patient caregiver deprescription hospitalization . Both Gallagher MERA approach intensive term human resource challenge generalize , implement sustain nationwide . Furthermore , current lack firm evidence risk benefit systemic deprescribing limited implementation concept routine medical practice . A technological solution facilitates deprescribing proven effectiveness safety would tremendous step forward deprescribing movement . Research Objectives : The investigator adapt implement electronic tool call MedStopper ( medstopper.com ) , use exist ruleset combine rule MERA order identify PIMs within 72 hour hospitalization prioritize medication deprescription . The tool use three key criterion deprescription : potential drug improve symptom , potential reduce risk future illness , likelihood cause harm . The recommendation MedStopper cue treat team consider deprescribing PIMs take consideration knowledge individual patient comorbidities , along understanding patient value goal care . The primary goal pilot study demonstrate MedStopper facilitate deprescription ( beyond usual care ) diverse population elderly patient . This pilot serve proof concept large multicenter RCT look impact process adverse drug event . This pilot facilitate : 1 ) estimate frequency PIMs ; 2 ) adverse drug event rate ; 3 ) rate recruitment , refusal loss follow ; 4 ) refinement MedStopper base real world user feedback ; 6 ) refinement adverse drug event endpoint adjudication health-related quality life interview process . The study conduct Ottawa Hospital , Toronto General Hospital two hospital McGill University Health Centre , Montreal ( Royal Victoria Montreal General Hospitals ) . Primary objective : The primary outcome reduction proportion potentially inappropriate medication ( PIMs ) discharge , compare proportion PIMs admission . The investigator hypothesize MedStopper facilitate deprescription PIMs thereby reduce proportion PIMs patient expose . Secondary objective : To determine intervention lead demonstrable improvement : ) Proportion PIMs 30-days post hospital discharge ; b ) adverse drug event within 30 day hospital discharge ; c ) fall hospital ; ) length stay ; e ) in-hospital mortality ; f ) overall number medication average patient receive discharge 30 day post ; g ) post-discharge self-reported health-related quality life ( HRQOL ) ; h ) emergency department visit readmission within 30 day ; ) 30-day cause mortality . This intervention novel electronic tool combine newly refine version STOPP/START criterion , 2015 Beers criterion , applicable recommendation Choosing Wisely Canada guide facilitate deprescribing . To investigator 's knowledge , first electronic intervention implement among heterogeneous at-risk , frail elderly , hospitalize patient . This trial test tool could lead transformative change medication appropriateness . 2.2 Methodological Approach Study design : The study design before-after intervention study . All hospital participate six week baseline measurement follow six week intervention . The primary outcome reduction proportion PIMs within 30 day discharge . Study Setting : This study take place clinical teach unit patient cared team compose medical student , junior senior resident internal medicine specialty , attend physician . The CTUs study take place admits complex elderly patient multiple comorbidities majority non-surgical frail elderly likely benefit medication stewardship intervention . Most medical trainee spend week month unit year , yield high exposure intervention . The investigator show medication stewardship project successful CTU change take place CTU continue discharge . Planned trial intervention : Within 72 hour admission ( exclude weekend holiday ) control intervention unit , patient 's documented medical history medication list manually extract trained research assistant . Intervention : Participants intervention phase electronically screen use customized version MedStopper include MERA criterion , measure patient frailty , patient demographics/comorbidities . MedStopper cross-reference information automatically identify prioritize deprescribing issue expert evaluation CTU team . In intervention , PIMs electronically identify communicated treat medical team MedStopper generate evidence-based recommendation include safely deprescribe taper medication necessary . In case multiple recommendation , limited prioritize , order avoid overwhelm treat team . The doctor care hospitalized patient receive information . At point , base expert medical judgement , collaboration patient/caregiver relevant physician ( i.e . consultant community physician ) , decision make deprescribe appropriate . Control : participant receive medication reconciliation unit pharmacist , review medical history medication use , identical follow , prioritize list generate treat team systematically trigger deprescribing . The result catalyst study ideally establish safety efficacy MedStopper electronically facilitate inpatient application criterion base STOPP/START , Beers Choosing Wisely recommendation identity prioritize PIMs deprescribing . Based positive outcome study , investigator would plan implement tool large study multiple hospital across Canada determine effectiveness reduce ADEs among similar frail elderly population .</detailed_description>
