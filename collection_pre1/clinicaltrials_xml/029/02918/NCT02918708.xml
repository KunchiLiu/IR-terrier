	<brief_summary>The National Vaccine Evaluation Consortium conduct Department Health fund trial trial provide information underpin change national immunisation vaccination schedule . This study assess different schedule pneumococcal conjugate vaccine work provide protection young infant . It well establish vaccine behave differently depend order give alongside immunisation . This show Hib MenC vaccine , similar structure pneumococcal vaccine study . The investigator measure responses pneumococcal vaccine well routine immunisation , provide study team . Infants recruit dedicated study staff primary care participate first vaccination 2 month age , blood sample take month booster year old , i.e . 13 month age . Any child find antibody level indicate protection Hib , MenC , MenB pneumococcal blood sample take 13 month age offer extra dose relevant vaccine ( ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment Novel Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccination Scheduled UK Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The UK Department Health provide routine vaccination schedule child UK administer GP surgery . The schedule update addition antigen amendment product schedule time improve protection afford paediatric population overall cost-effectiveness programme . It well establish effect give different vaccine antigens together , well order number dose give prim boosting , affect immunological response elicit . For example co-administration different polysaccharide conjugate vaccine may enhance response show prior study group - National Vaccine Evaluation Consortium ( NVEC ) . This demonstrate tetanus-toxoid conjugated MCC vaccine enhance response co-administered Hib conjugate vaccine also conjugate tetanus toxoid . In case , one conjugate vaccine available disease , occur early day Hib programme vaccine conjugate tetanus toxoid CRM - natural nontoxigenic diphtheria protein- available . NVEC therefore conduct study assess impact interchange two different Hib conjugate vaccine three dose primary immunisation course . This show interchange two different Hib conjugate primary immunisation compromise immune response mixed schedule give high antibody response three dos give conjugate . However , mixed schedule MCC-TT MCC-CRM subsequently study NVEC MCC-CRM/MCC-TT two dose schedule show inferior MCC-TT give first prim dose . Until , UK use pneumococcal conjugate vaccine Pfizer form seven 13 valent PCV , current schedule recommend vaccination PCV13 2 , 4 12 month age ( 2+1 schedule ) . The 13 polysaccharide serotypes PCV13 conjugate CRM . More recently 10 valent conjugate vaccine manufacture GSK ( PCV10 ) license use UK 2+1 schedule . The 10 serotypes PCV10 also PCV13 lack serotypes 3 , 6A 19A . No significant protection vaccinate infant show PCV13 serotype 3 [ Andrews et al 2014 ] 6A 19A PCV10 show provide cross protection serotypes . Like PCV13 , PCV10 safe efficacious global use . Unlike PCV13 , however , protein use conjugation PCV10 mixture Haemophilus influenzae protein D , tetanus toxoid diphtheria toxoid . As Hib MCC conjugate vaccine , two PCV product could use UK schedule would provide reassurance vaccine supply could improve cost effectiveness reduce vaccine cost . However , PCV10 vaccine consider use UK , particularly combination PCV10 PCV13 use national schedule , would require evidence adequate immunogenicity mixed schedule infer experience Hib MCC conjugate . The result clinical trial PCV13 use two prim dos 2 4 month follow PCV10 booster dose 12 month recently report . This show protective antibody response post-booster ( serotype specific antibody level ELISA ≥0.35ug/mL ) 9 13 PCV31 serotypes achieve least 97 % infant boost PCV10 whereas PCV13 boost infant achieve least 97 % protective response 11 13 serotypes . For 10 13 serotypes geometric mean concentration antibody significantly high PCV13 boost infant 3 serotypes higher PCV10 boost infant . This study suggest mixed PCV schedule CRM-based vaccine give first may optimal . This study build work , assess alternative combination , PCV10 prim follow PCV13 boosting . The comparator arm current standard care . The study therefore include two group : 2+1 : PCV13 2 , 4 12 month age 2+1 PCV10 2 4 month age follow PCV13 12 month age All participant receive vaccine define routine infant immunisation schedule . This study rapidly provide information JCVI option UK schedule pneumococcal immunisation infant best current option could expand whilst retain appropriate protection afford current schedule . This study fund UK Department Health sponsor Public Health England . Following write informed consent parent/ guardian , infant randomly assign one two treatment group receive vaccination 12 month age well two blood sample . The first sample month completion primary series , five month age , second month booster dos , 13 month age . Extra dos MenB , MenC , Hib and/or pneumococcal vaccine ( ) offer immune response measure post-booster blood correlate protection . Information study present Department Health underpin ongoing evolution national vaccination schedule . A manuscript submit publication peer review journal participate family receive summary study finding post .</detailed_description>
