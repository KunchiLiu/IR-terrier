	<brief_title>Ultrasound Assisted Lumbar Puncture Neonate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obtaining cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) lumbar puncture ( LP ) essential procedure neonatal/infant intensive care unit ( N/IICU ) establish diagnosis determine treatment . The traditional technique perform LP involve palpation anatomic landmark follow `` blind '' stick appropriate inter-spinous process space . This technique failure rate ( define inability obtain cerebrospinal fluid obtain traumatic puncture ) 15-50 % . Bedside ultrasonography posse ability visualize anatomic landmark , include subarachnoid space . In adult literature , ultrasound show reduce LP failure rate . Its utility also show significantly improve success rate accuracy epidural needle placement neonates child undergo regional anesthesia . Increasing proportion successful LPs N/IICU could significantly reduce patient/family discomfort , sedation exposure , unit travel , additional interventional procedure antibiotic use . However , research utility bedside ultrasound assist LPs clinician work N/IICU lack . This prospective randomized control trial . Eligible subject randomize undergo LP ( perform part standard care ) ultrasound assist method traditional landmark method . Primary Objective : -To determine bedside ultrasound-assisted LP , perform N/IICU clinician neonates infant age ≤6 month , increase proportion successful first attempt non-traumatic LPs compare traditional landmark palpation technique . Secondary Objectives : - To determine bedside-ultrasound assisted LPs increase proportion overall successful non-traumatic LPs within 2 attempt . - To determine bedside-ultrasound assist LPs associate decrease length antibiotic exposure patient undergoing LPs .</detailed_description>
