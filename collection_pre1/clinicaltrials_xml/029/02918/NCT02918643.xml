	<brief_summary>Objective : To develop evaluate effectiveness mobile application support decision make prescription drug elderly patient . Method : Firstly , two-tier content validation potentially inappropriate medicine ( PIM ) elderly base Beers Criteria STOPP . For validation , modify Delphi consensus technique apply . Twelve national expert invite . For statement contain Beers criterion STOPP proposition prepare order allow participant issue opinion proposition assign value accord agreement statement . Therefore , Likert scale establish score 1 5 ( completely disagree - strongly agree ) use . Statements average score 4.0 consider consensus . All information regard PIMs make available application tablet . The information risk recommendation drug available whenever user enter medicine name . The application develop Android platform , base Java programming language . To evaluate use application 30 doctor work basic health unit health unit family municipality Bahia ask join study . Upon acceptance , proportion PIMs ' prescription professional minimum period two month analyze . Later , 15 doctor randomize intervention group receive tablet application instal . They train use well access Evidence Based Health Portal Ministry Health . The control group 15 physician receive tablet train access Evidence Based Health Portal . The study blind participant main investigator . To continue , information analyze sample PIMs ' prescription group . To access information prescription ' duplicate original , file pharmacy , patient file home visit require . The PIMs prescription ratio intervention compare .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Step 1 : Initially , data drug contain Beers STOPP criterion review . The availability medicine Brazilian market analyze website National Health Surveillance Agency ( ANVISA ) . Subsequently , drug data place questionnaire send national expert order establish consensus information present . The questionnaire assessment happen two round . The first round consist send proposition base information contain Beers criterion , STOPP 2012 2006 order allow participant issue opinion proposition assign value accord agreement statement . Therefore , Likert scale establish score 1 5 ( completely disagree - strongly agree ) use . For second round , score analyzed proposition consensus send along comment specialist . In case , specialist may review maintain position . It worth note application questionnaire round expert access identification peer . In second round , Statements average score 4.0 consider consensus . The final information use mobile device application development . Experts select convenience . Twelve professional experience geriatrics invite via email participate expert validation Beers Criteria STOPP . This call include summary project general information Delphi Technique . After acceptance , receive Term Informed Consent Form ( ICF ) Authorization Release Name Specialist / Senior , must sign return . The application develop Android platform , base Java programming language . Step 2 : Study design : Clinical trial , randomize , single-blind , parallel-group . They invite participate stage 30 physician work primary care municipality Bahia . Upon acceptance participate study signing Informed Consent form ( IC ) , proportion PIMs ' prescription professional minimum period two month analyze . After , physician randomize include one two study group : Intervention : 15 doctor receive tablet application instal train use well access Evidence Based Health Portal Ministry Health . Control Group : 15 doctor receive tablet without application also train access Evidence Based Health Portal . After intervention , data examine sample proportion PIM prescription professional . Hypothesis : The author evaluate hypothesis frequency PIM order low intervention group , compare control group . Reference population : The number participate physician determine convenience . Currently city twenty health unit ( primary care ) internet access . The investigator choose select two doctor unit ensure confidentiality professional randomize intervention control group . Randomization : The random sequence assign study group determine principal investigator base randomization table , construct randomization method interchangeable block . A sequence number generate store sealed envelope , individually arrange mark serial number participate physician . The envelope low number open researcher inclusion new doctor study . Prescription sampling : In order calculate sample prescription verify intervention follow factor consider : expect proportion PIM prescription intervention 35 % , expect difference intervention control group intervention : 30 % . 5 % significance level 80 % power test . Two-tailed hypothesis test loss 20 % prescription . The number prescription per doctor also take consideration proportion elderly patient attend ( previous three month ) per doctor . A sensitivity analysis perform compare professional group meet different proportion elderly order isolate bias demand . Patient prescription randomly select . Inclusion criterion : Doctors meet elderly people basic health unit , family health unit primary care polyclinics . Exclusion criterion : Doctors residency medicine-geriatrics specialization recognize Brazilian Society Geriatrics . Dependent variable : Number order least one PIM prescribe , frequency PIMs prescribe , type PIMs prescribed . Primary outcome - Frequency PIMs prescribed . Independent variable : Age ; gender ; training time ; medical specialty . Study Procedures : In order evaluate PIM prescription frequency intervention , prescription ' duplicate original store pharmacy health facility patient record use . In occasion information available , home visit carry check first copy prescription user 's possession . In situation , user must sign consent form . The visit carry preferably company community health agent . After allocation doctor , group separately receive training access Evidence Based Health Portal Ministry Health . For , investigator use one computer lab Universidade Federal da Bahia - Anísio Teixeira campus . In case professional ' low compliance , train hold health clinic , day health team meeting . Then , doctor intervention group , train access application well lecture relate PIMs . After receive tablet , doctor visit project team member least twice week 2 month intervention . During visit struggle regard access Evidence Based Health Portal check . It check doctor consult application service time , even outside work hour . The number hit monitor also feature available application , purpose . Those access application least week consider loss data analysis . After intervention period , new sample prescription later analysis collect . Data processing statistical analysis : The data post reviewed database build SPSS® Windows version 23.0 , order make necessary statistical analysis . Statistical analysis compose descriptive analysis simple frequency chi-square test evaluate difference proportion PIM prescription group intervention . The statistical significance level p &lt; 0.05 95 % confidence interval .</detailed_description>
