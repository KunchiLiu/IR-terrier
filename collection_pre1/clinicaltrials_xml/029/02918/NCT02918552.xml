	<brief_title>Oral Nitrite Older Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Age-related physiological change predispose heart failure preserve ejection fraction ( HFpEF ) . Thus , HFpEF prevalence escalate old population expands . High mortality morbidity , diminish quality life , spiral healthcare cost typical consequence , effective HFpEF therapy know . Therefore , several small exercise training ( ExT ) trial HFpEF stand show ExT result improve aerobic exercise capacity infer ExT constitutes novel substantive therapy . Nonetheless , benefit evident month moderate high intensity ExT ; regimens unfeasible patient . In fact , poor compliance ExT typical HFpEF patient . The investigator propose intrinsic physiological component HFpEF pathophysiology predispose `` fatigability '' . The investigator advance concept fatigability quantify performance-based measure ; i.e. , subjective tire standardized steady-state walking ( perceived fatigability ) deterioration self-selected walk speed time ( performance fatigability ) . The investigator assert therapy reduce fatigability enhance HFpEF outcomes . Ongoing study reveal pleiotropic benefit oral inorganic nitrite ( NO2 ) , include enhanced performance skeletal muscle ( metabolism bioenergetics ) vasomotor response ( systemic pulmonary ) . The investigator ' pilot work show safety biological efficacy oral NO2 capsule . Thus , investigator propose randomize , control , double-blinded trial study oral NO2 therapy older ( ≥70 year ) HFpEF patient . Aim 1 explores utility NO2 capsule reduce perceive performance fatigability ( rat perceive exertion ) , improve aerobic capacity ( peak oxygen uptake ) increase daily activity ( accelerometry ) . Aim 2 delineates mediate process NO2 benefit achieve . Skeletal muscle determinant differentiate right left heart vasomotor dynamic integrate assessment use 31Phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy percutaneous needle muscle biopsy make use non-invasive invasive cardiopulmonary exercise testing , near infrared spectroscopy technique . The principal investigator train geriatrics cardiology , solidly orient dynamic age cardiovascular disease ( clinically mechanistically ) particular expertise functional assessment skeletal muscle gene expression determinant performance . The investigative team provide formidable synergy well-suited translational investigation systemic , cellular , sub-cellular physiological dynamic . Our proposal significant multiple respect : 1 ) HFpEF endemic age constitutes critical contemporary healthcare challenge today 's grow population old adult . 2 ) Fatigability root HFpEF pathophysiology , previously address key part management . 3 ) NO2 therapy novel compel therapeutic strategy . 4 ) Mechanisms underlie fatigability clarify ; advance principles patient-centered care clarify mechanism underlie patient 's experience fatigability .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age ≥70 year Diagnosis HFpEF [ adapt 2016 European Society Cardiology ( ESC ) Guidelines include : 1 . Prior diagnosis HF via one : medical record diagnosis attend cardiologist verbal confirmation HFpEF attend cardiologist PI review medical record confirm HFpEF AND 2 . Ejection Fraction % ≥40 Clinically stable ( euvolemic ; baseline heart rate &lt; 100 bpm ) without hospitalization invasive cardiac procedure 6 week Patients use 81 milligram ( mg ) aspirin ( ASA ) eligible , ask hold medication 3 day prior biopsy . This technique previously use consistent safety . Patients also ask avoid nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medication ( NSAIDs ) 2 day prior biopsy . Patients use antithrombin antiplatelet therapy plan modify prior muscle biopsy individually coordination participant 's primary cardiologist . Allergy lidocaine BP &gt; 170/95 &lt; 100/60 Anemia : &lt; 11.0 ( ♂ ) ,10.0 ( ♀ ) Dementia inability give inform consent Endstage malignancy Severe orthopedic exercise limitation Use chronic oral corticosteroid medication affect muscle function . Chronic alcohol drug dependency . Any bleeding disorder would contraindicate biopsy history clinically significant bleed diathesis ( e.g. , Hemophilia A B , Von Willebrand 's Disease congenital Factor VII deficiency ) . Psychiatric hospitalization within last 3 month Major cardiovascular event procedure within prior 6 week HF secondary significant uncorrected primary valvular disease ( except mitral regurgitation secondary leave ventricular dysfunction ) . If valve replacement perform , patient may enrol 12 month procedure . Severe uncorrected primary valvular heart disease ( valve replacement perform , patient eligible least 12 month ) Mechanical valve replacement require warfarin Peripheral pulmonary artery disease Currently take clopidogrel recent stent placement and/or complex atherosclerotic lesion hold clopidogrel create disproportionate risk . Current use organic nitrate phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor ( PDE5s ) Unable hold warfarin use bridge therapy , hold aspirin 3 day ( 81 mg ) , 3 day ( 325 mg ) prior muscle biopsy thienopyridine medication 5 day prior muscle biopsy . Subjects diabetes whose HgbA1c &gt; 10.0 Other chronic unstable disease active neoplasm , end stage chronic kidney , liver organ disease ,</criteria>
