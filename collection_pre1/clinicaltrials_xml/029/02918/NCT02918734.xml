	<brief_summary>In randomize controlled trial investigator compare result primary anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL ) reconstruction use two different method femoral fixation bone-patellar tendon-bone ( BPTB ) autograft . Interference screw standard method fix femoral side BPTB graft ; however , several pitfall report . Cortical fixation Endobutton CL BTB Fixation System become available clinical result describe promising ; however , randomize control trial compare two femoral fixation method conduct , publish data confirms bone block heals tunnel new method . The aim study compare outcome primary ACL reconstruction BPTB autograft use Endobutton CL BTB metal interference screw femoral fixation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fixation Patellar Tendon Grafts Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction . Endobutton v Metal Interference Screws</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL ) reconstructions bone-patellar tendon-bone ( BPTB ) autografts recently find low risk revision compare hamstring tendon autograft , BPTB become graft choice . Interference screw standard method fix femoral side BPTB graft ; however problem damage graft failure due nonparallel screw placement report . Cortical fixation use suspensory system use soft-tissue graft fixation several year , correspond device , Endobutton CL BTB Fixation System ( Smith &amp; Nephew , Inc. , Andover , MA , USA ) , become available fixation bone-tendon-bone graft . The clinical result fixation Endobutton CL BTB describe promising ; however , randomize control trial compare two fixation method conduct , publish data confirms bone block heals tunnel new method . In randomized controlled trial , patient undergo primary ACL reconstruction randomize either Endobutton group interference screw group . The primary aim study compare two fixation method , assess patient report outcomes , laxity , range motion muscle strength . Knee related quality life 2 year surgery primary outcome , measure Knee injury Osteoarthritis Outcome Score ( KOOS ) subscale `` knee related Quality life ( QOL ) '' . Other aim see difference integration bone block femoral tunnel assess CT scan , risk develop osteoarthritis assess radiograph , risk postoperative complication revision . The patient follow 6 week , 6 month , 2 year 10 year surgery . CT scan perform 6 month , radiographs 2 year 10 year . In addition detail rehabilitation record . Patients undergo revision follow excluded comparison study . Our hypothesis difference outcome primary ACL reconstruction BPTB autograft use Endobutton CL BTB metal interference screw femoral fixation , metal interference screw tibial fixation .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Primary reconstruction ACL rupture Surgery least 6 week injury The patient must accept sign informed consent form surgery Medical indication use another graft BPTB autograft ( history anterior knee pain occupation etc . require frequent kneel ) Previous major surgical procedure knee Major additional injury knee ( posterior cruciate ligament , lateral collateral ligament , medial collateral ligament , suture meniscus lesion major cartilage lesion undergoing cartilage repair ) Contralateral ACL injury ( treat untreated ) Present former serious illness make followup rehabilitation difficult ( e.g . alcohol drug abuse , psychiatric disease )</criteria>
