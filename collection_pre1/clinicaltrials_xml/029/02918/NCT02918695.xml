	<brief_title>Comparison Geriatric Screening Methods Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Given grow elderly multiple myeloma population , increase therapeutic possibility importance geriatric screening , study want : - compare clinical judgment standardize geriatric screening approach ( G8 , CGA IMWG score ) newly diagnose elderly myeloma patient evaluate influence detection geriatric problem choice anti-myeloma treatment - evaluate geriatric score subsequent treatment choice influence therapeutic efficacy toxicity Geriatric score perform 3 different way : - clinical judgment perform treat physician - validated score system independently perform trained nurse/ health care worker . Initial score do G8 score . If abnormal G8 score present ( &lt; = 14 ) , CGA perform . - base CGA parameter , Palumbo/IMWG geriatric score calculated Results obtain physician-based assessment geriatric assessment compare treatment initiation . If , extent knowledge GA influence therapeutic decision treat physician register . In addition , register geriatric problem diagnose CGA assessment already know unknown treat physician . After three month treatment time disease progression , geriatric assessment repeat order judge evolution ( disappearance , improvement , worsen ) score parameter , emergence new geriatric symptom .</detailed_description>
