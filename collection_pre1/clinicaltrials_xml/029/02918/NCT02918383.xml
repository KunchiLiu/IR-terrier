	<brief_summary>Laser Angiography use indocyanin green ( ICG ) relatively new technique utilized assess viability soft tissue , prominently general surgery plastic surgery literature . This technique use prediction soft tissue viability assess perfusion status . There currently Orthopaedic literature regard use device assessment subchondral perfusion articular surface distal femur chondral surface . In pilot study , use ICG detect perfusion status distal femur proximal tibia surgical approach knee correlate visible sign arthritis . For example , due difference visible ICG angiography correlate gross change cartilage health visible naked eye radiographic imaging .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>ICG FDA register since 1959 negatively charge , water-soluble , tricarbocyanine . It bind readily plasma protein injection almost exclusive bile excretion , possess extremely low toxicity profile . In plasma , ICG absorption peak around 807 nm emission peak around 822 nm , within infrared range . ICG short half-life 150-180 second , make multiple administration possible intra-operatively . It give intravenously administration1-4 . After give IV , rapidly distribute throughout circulatory system . When light specific wavelength interacts dye , dye fluoresces near-infrared range , acquire special camera . In daily practice , visualization palpation use provide information health articular cartilage , arthroscopy open treatment . However , real time assessment cartilage viability subchondral perfusion available . Determination perfusion status cartilage surface via intra-operative modality may provide valuable information diagnostically , well guide therapeutic intervention . Some possible us technology may diagnose treat osteochondral defect , predict future osteoarthritis , delineate predict area avascular necrosis , use oncologic surgery . It currently think dye currently work extremely well soft tissue literature , directly translate able accurately assess subchondral bone perfusion . The incidence symptomatic knee arthritis United States approach 50 % population time patient turn 85 show significantly impact patient 's quality life . In 2003 , United States spend $ 128 billion arthritis expenditure . Arthritis describe degeneration , absence , healthy cartilage . The current way intra-operatively assess cartilage viability inspection palpation , although obviously always indicative overall health cartilage . Although MRI may obtain pre-operatively show similar information , costly provide information assess intra-operatively . Furthermore , MRI provide information perfusion status cartilage . It belief image modality provide valuable information diagnostically able guide surgical decision make regard treatment patient . For example , prior undergoing unicompartmental knee replacement , patient find degenerative change compartment , surgeon may convert total knee arthroplasty . If patient osteochondral defect , know perfusion status may provide information whether reconstruct defect allograft drill defect . A patient undergoing cruciate retain total knee arthroplasty may benefit know posterior cruciate ligament pathologic , lead posterior stabilize knee replacement . For patient avascular necrosis , valuable prognostic information viability cartilage may help determine joint preserve surgery possible . The use intra-operative ICG may impact intra-operative decision make perfusion observe may predict overall health structure currently way assess real-time .</detailed_description>
