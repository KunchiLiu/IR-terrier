	<brief_summary>This single-center , randomize , partially blind study determine whether 42-day old red blood cell ( RBCs ) deliver oxygen effectively 7-day old RBCs also determine whether transfusion 28-day old RBCs non-inferior 7-day old RBCs respect oxygen delivery . In study , subject randomize transfused 2 unit autologous ( one 's ) RBCs either 7- , 28- , 42-days old . Endpoints include change exercise duration VO2 max ( test oxygen consumption/delivery ) group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>VO2 Max : In Vivo Model Functional Red Cell Testing . Can RECESS Explained ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The US Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) regulation permit additive-containing RBCs store 42 day prior transfusion . However , RBCs progressively develop abnormality storage . The efficacy old store blood , i.e. , effective oxygen delivery , establish rigorous control study . Due pragmatic reason , large clinical trial randomize patient `` old '' blood may feasible . Every subject 2 phlebotomy visit Stony Brook University Hospital . Subjects randomized 7- 42-day old group 2 unit blood remove Week 0 another 2 unit remove Week 5 . However , remain 28-day group 2 unit blood remove Week 2 1 unit blood remove Week 5 . During week 6 , subject 3 study visit : 1 ) On Monday , VO2 max test ; 2 ) On Wednesday , transfusion 2 unit autologous RBCs ( 1 hour ) , follow VO2 max test 2 hour later ; 3 ) On Friday , VO2 max test do order calculate delta VO2 max ( Friday minus Monday result ) .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Habitual exerciser define ≥ 30 minute least moderate high intensity exercise ≥ 3 time per week . After consent , subsequent screen visit , VO2 max test perform , subject low value ( &lt; 35 mL/kg/min ) exclude ( screen failure ) . Based previous experience , anticipate &lt; 10 % subject fall category Calculated total blood volume ( TBV ) ≥4,500 mL use establish formula : 1 . Men : ( 0.006012 x H3 ) + ( 14.6 x W ) + 604 = TBV 2 . Women : ( 0.005835 x H3 ) + ( 15 x W ) + 183 = TBV [ H=height inch ; W=weight pound ] Has access transportation visit blood collection facility return Stony Brook study visit .
