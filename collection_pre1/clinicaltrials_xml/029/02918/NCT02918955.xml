	<brief_summary>Treatment regionally-advanced head neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) require multidisciplinary approach combination surgery , radiotherapy ( RT ) chemotherapy . Due aggressive combined modality , patient undergo treatment many survivor develop toxicity impact quality life ( QoL ) sometimes lead mortality . Lymph node metastasis HNSCC frequent consider one important prognostic factor , result decrease survival 50 % . More three decade , optimal management strategy node positive HNSCC key subject debate . In summary , current literature provide u two important finding : First , contemporary imaging treatment modality , role plan neck dissection ( ND ) add ( chemo ) radiotherapy ( ( C ) RT ) term oncological outcome survival . Second , modern RT technique , tailor treatment follow up-front neck dissection ( UFND ) allow significant reduction treatment volume de-escalation dose neck , lead reduction treatment related toxicity . In study strategy without up-front neck dissection prior chemo-radiotherapy compare .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The main objective project test hypothesis addition UFND prior ( C ) RT result significant reduction treatment toxicity improvement QoL regionally advance ( cN2-3 ) HNSCC dose de-escalation volume reduction RT . The primary endpoint trial evaluate toxicity begin radiotherapy 90 day end treatment . The incidence acute subacute toxicity higher grade ≥3 ( CTCAE v.4 , except Xerostomia , RTOG/EORTC scale use ) compare study arm . Secondary endpoint include survival endpoint treatment modality ; i.e . loco-regional control , progression-free overall survival . Assessment QoL ( EORTC QLQ-C30 + H &amp; N43 ) , late toxicity , surgical complication , cost-effectiveness need feeding-tube part final analysis trial . Trial design : randomize multi-center open-label comparative one-staged phase III trial superiority design primary endpoint high grade radiation toxicity 90 day completion treatment . Interventions arm trial consider standard treatment . No experimental diagnostic tool use trial . In addition randomize arm , two identical observational arm open patient diagnosed activation randomize arm , subsequently refuse randomize . Their aim prospectively acquire high quality data patient refuse randomization . The observational randomized cohort analyze separately pre-defined endpoint . For calculation sample size , grade ≥3 acute subacute toxicity CRT alone ( Arm A ) assume 70 % base literature . For primary endpoint , follow-up period 90 day last day ( C ) RT need accrual last patient . However , 2 year follow-up need secondary endpoint . On basis , sample size calculate base Pearson chi-squared test . Assuming toxicity fraction 70 % grade 3 high toxicity Arm A , relative risk 0.7 ( 49 % Arm B ) , two-sided alpha 0.05 , power 80 % , drop-out rate 5 % , allocation ratio 1 . An overall sample size 182 patient calculate . Expected accrual time 3 year .</detailed_description>
