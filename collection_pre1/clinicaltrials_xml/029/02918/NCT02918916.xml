	<brief_summary>Introduction : Recent study show positive result application phototherapy improvement performance acceleration recovery process application exercise . However , effect phototherapy combine training primary adaptation process remain unclear . Research objectives : The primary objective study analyze compare effect phototherapy use different light source ( laser light emmiting diode - LED ) interacting combine train clinical , functional , psychological outcome vascular endothelial growth factor . The secondary objective compare benefit provide phototherapy participant different level train adaptation . Design : A controlled trial , double-blind , placebo-controlled conduct stratified randomization conceal allocation . Participants Setting : After fulfil eligibility criterion , forty-five male participant participate study . Procedure : In phase 1 , participant perform six-weeks combined training ( sprint squat ) . In phase 2 , participant allocate , stratify randomization ( base adaptation capacity training ) , three group : active phototherapy group ( AG ) , placebo phototherapy group ( PG ) , control group ( CG ) . A new six-week training period start . In phase participant carry train normally adjust load sprint squat receive recovery strategy relate group belong . Intervention : Active placebo phototherapy apply trained therapist , sprint squat . During period recovery strategy AG PG , CG participant remain seated passive recovery , supervise independent therapist . Measurements : The measurement include clinical , functional , psychological outcome vascular endothelial growth factor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Introduction : Recent study show positive result application phototherapy improvement performance acceleration recovery process application exercise . However , effect phototherapy combine training primary adaptation process remain unclear . Research objectives : The primary objective study analyze compare effect phototherapy use different light source ( laser LEDs ) interacting combine train clinical , functional , psychological outcome vascular endothelial growth factor . The secondary objective compare benefit provide phototherapy participant different level train adaptation . Design : A controlled trial , double-blind , placebo-controlled conduct stratified randomization conceal allocation . Participants Setting : After fulfil eligibility criterion , forty-five male participant participate study . The inclusion criterion include : healthy male , age 18-30 year agree participate study . Participants follow exclude study : presence anemia , inflammation , diabetes , history metastasis muscle injury lower limb spine previous six month , occurrence musculoskeletal injury study . Procedure : In phase 1 , participant perform six-weeks combined training ( sprint squat ) . In phase 2 , participant allocate , stratify randomization ( base adaptation capacity training ) , three group : active phototherapy group ( AG ) , placebo phototherapy group ( PG ) , control group ( CG ) . A new six-week training period start . In phase participant carry train normally adjust load sprint squat receive recovery strategy relate group belong . Intervention : Active placebo phototherapy apply trained therapist , sprint squat , bilaterally six site quadriceps direct contact skin . The dosage apply 30J per site . The procedure AG apply PG , however emitter disabled . During period recovery strategy AG PG , CG participant remain seated passive recovery , supervise independent therapist . Measurements : The measurement include clinical ( muscle soreness , pain threshold , perception exertion , perception recovery ) , functional ( squat strength power , maximal voluntary isometric contraction , maximal incremental test , squat jump , sprint test ) , psychological ( self-assessments readiness exercise , fatigue , vigor , pain , belief intervention effectiveness ) outcomes vascular endothelial growth factor . Analysis : For analysis functional outcome , data normality check Kolmogorov-Smirnov test change baseline follow Student T test comparison . For outcome , sphericity data test Mauchly 's test . In case violation sphericity assumption , Greenhouse-Geisser correction use . Data analyze use repeated-measures analysis variance ( Bonferroni 's test perform require ) , provide information time , group , interaction effect . A significance level 5 % assume statistical analysis .</detailed_description>
