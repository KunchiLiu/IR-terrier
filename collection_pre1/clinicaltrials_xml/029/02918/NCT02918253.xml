	<brief_summary>Brachytherapy monotherapy treatment highly effective localized prostate cancer , traditionally deliver whole prostate gland . Lately , low dose rate ( LDR ) brachytherapy increasingly replace high dose rate ( HDR ) brachytherapy treatment scheme . While brachytherapy 's oncologic outcome excellent , without incidence adverse effect include urinary , rectal , sexual toxicity affect patient 's quality life . This study incorporate HDR monotherapy treatment option early stage favourable risk prostate cancer . Additionally , aim evaluate role focal HDR brachytherapy well-defined disease base multiparametric MRI ( mpMRI ) . This approach may offer option reduce treatment toxicity maintain oncologic outcome compare whole-gland therapy . Advantages quality life could exhibit form reduce urinary discomfort incontinence , rectal symptom , improve erectile prostatic gland function . This study would particularly relevant current era earlier localized prostate cancer detection , new image modality ( e.g . mpMRI ) become routine component patient care .</brief_summary>
