	<brief_title>The Efficacy Whisperflow CPAP System Versus Nasal High Flow Patients High Risk Postextubation Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postextubation respiratory failure uncommon condition discontinuation mechanical ventilation . Subsequently reintubation mechanical ventilation postextubation respiratory failure may lead increase hospital morbidity mortality prolong intensive care hospital stay . Several study demonstrate efficacy non-invasive ventilation prevent postextubation failure patient high risk extubation failure . The variable generator whisper flow system ( ( Philips Respironics , Murrysville , PA , USA ) one widely use continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) device UK . This device employ oxygen-driven venturi entrain air generate high fresh gas flow 140 liter per minute . The oxygen/air mixture enters breathe circuit exit threshold resistor namely CPAP valve . Whisperflow able provide flow breathe system via oronasal mask exceed peak inspiratory flow rate patient may improve work breathe well gas exchange . In daily clinical practice , investigator apply device humidifier patient wean difficulty patient risk postextubation failure . High-flow nasal oxygen therapy ( HFNO ) device heat humidify oxygen distribute nose high flow rate . With high flow rate ( 60 Liter per minute ) , generate low level positive airway pressure . Physiological benefit HFNO comprise decrease dead space , work breathe low level positive airway pressure associate well lung recruitment . Furthermore , fraction inspire oxygen adjust measure change fraction oxygen drive gas . In present randomize , control trial , investigator compare two device oxygen therapy , low level continuous positive airway pressure , nasal high-flow oxygen therapy CPAP 5 cmH2O deliver variable generator WhisperFlow System oronasal mask , critically ill patient risk postextubation failure . The investigator hypothesize nasal high-flow superior CPAP term reintubation rate .</detailed_description>
