	<brief_summary>The purpose study find safe effective way administer IV antibiotic treat acute pulmonary exacerbation ( APEs ) patient cystic fibrosis ( CF ) cause pathogen , like Pseudomonas aeruginosa . This study test safety effectiveness two commonly prescribe IV antibiotic : tobramycin colistin . Though regularly use , much know drug compare term toxicity , short term treatment APE many treatment course drug many year . There currently guideline safest effective antibiotic use treat APEs . We study kidney function , sputum culture , treatment outcome patient receive routine administration one two IV antibiotic . We also test outcome patient receive less frequent dose schedule IV colistin . The hope new schedule IV colistin , twice day adjust base blood urine test , reduce harmful side effect , kidney damage , still powerful treatment CF microbial pathogen .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Male female â‰¥ 18 year age Visit 1 . 2 . Documentation CF diagnosis evidence one clinical feature consistent CF phenotype one follow criterion : Sweat chloride equal great 60 mEq/L quantitative pilocarpine iontophoresis test . Two wellcharacterized mutation cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( CFTR ) gene Abnormal nasal potential difference ( NPD ) measure change NPD response low chloride solution isoproterenol less 5 mV . 3 . Documentation presence acute pulmonary exacerbation , base CF Foundation guideline , diagnose faculty member Denver Adult CF Program . 4 . Respiratory culture ( ) demonstrate evidence Pseudomonas aeruginosa Achromobacter species airway infection . 5 . Subject able produce sputum , undergo phlebotomy , provide write consent . 6 . The subject 's treating physician determine receive either tobramycin colistin intravenously one designate agent APE treatment . Subjects able receive either tobramycin colistin part antibiotic regimen randomize one three arm . If treat physician deems subject receive tobramycin due vestibular toxicity , ototoxicity bacterial resistance , subject randomize either standard PKadjusted colistin . 1 . Concomitant administration bactrim ( due effect creatinine ) . 2 . Concomitant administration inhale colistin patient colistin PK arm , create inaccuracy colistin sputum concentration measurement . 3 . Patients treat B. cepacia , due colistin resistance pathogen . 4 . Presence chronic renal insufficiency , abnormal baseline creatinine &gt; 1.2mg/dL . 5 . Presence condition abnormality opinion investigator would compromise safety patient quality data . 6 . Inability perform reproducible spirometry . 7 . Inability expectorate sputum .</criteria>
