	<brief_title>Effect Pre-op NRT Peri-operative Complications Long-term Abstinence : A Pilot Trial Patients Undergoing CABG Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim project 1 . To determine pre-operative , ( short-term ) NRT , 1 3 week surgery , improve long-term quit rate among smoker undergo elective CABG surgery . 2 . To determine effect pre-operative NRT perceive stress symptom nicotine withdrawal time surgery . 3 . To assess , retroactively , impact pre-operative cessation peri-operative complication infection rate , respiratory failure , myocardial infarction , stroke , sepsis , shock prolong hospital stay . We therefore hypothesize NRT give smoker pre-admission period ( 1-3 week prior surgery ) , likely biochemically abstinent cigarette smoke 6 month hospitalization experience few peri-operative complication To assess measure , design single site , double-blinded randomize controlled trial University Ottawa Heart Institute ( UOHI ) . Patients identified smoker initial visit PAU undergo baseline assessment randomly assign ( 1:1 ) either active placebo 21mg NRT patch . They wear patch baseline visit day surgery UOHI . Following surgery , receive follow phone call 1 6 month post-discharge . They complete series short questionnaire ass smoke status , stress level nicotine withdrawal symptom . Those identify smoke-free ask complete carbon monoxide breathe test chemically validate smoking status . The study protocol review Research Ethics board UOHI participant provide write informed consent prior undertake study activity .</detailed_description>
