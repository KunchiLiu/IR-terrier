	<brief_title>Complications From Use Calcium Phosphate Paste Mandibular Lengthening Osteotomies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The sagittal split osteotomy ( SSO ) commonly use correct dentofacial discrepancy . Correction distocclusion achieve lengthen mandible , balanced facial appearance obtain increase chin projection . Calcium phosphate paste use mandibular lengthening surgery avoid unaesthetic notch low border ( 1 ) ( 2 ) help stabilize segment osteosynthesis slippage fear . A recently perform retrospective study show increase infectious complication calcium phosphate paste use indication . Several precaution identify could undertake decrease infectious complication . The study conclude prospective study require precaution implement determine whether infectious complication reduce . The aim study investigate whether harden paste still increase incidence site infection implementation several precaution use standardize antibiotic prophylactic protocol .</detailed_description>
