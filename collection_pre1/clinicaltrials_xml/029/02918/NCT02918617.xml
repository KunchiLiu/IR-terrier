	<detailed_description>This double-blind , randomize , control , parallel group , outpatient clinical trial , involve total 270 patient diagnose dentin hypersensitivity , randomly assign nine treatment group 30 patient . Males females age 18 80 year enrol . The nine group randomly assign use one nine test product : ( 1 ) toothpaste contain nano-HAP ( high concentration ) ; ( 2 ) toothpaste contain nano-HAP ( low concentration ) ; ( 3 ) toothpaste contain nano-HAP potassium nitrate ( KNO3 ) ; ( 4 ) toothpaste contain NovaMin ; ( 5 ) standard fluoride toothpaste 1500 ppm MFP ; ( 6 ) toothpaste contain nano-HAP ( medium concentration ) ; ( 7 ) placebo toothpaste ; ( 8 ) cream contain nano-HAP ; ( 9 ) placebo cream . Subjects instruct use study toothpaste sole oral hygiene product 8 week treatment duration cream apply retainer tray 5 minute bed night . For use toothpaste , subject instruct brush teeth twice daily 2 minute , morning last thing bed , apply occasion one-inch strip assign toothpaste wet commercially available soft-bristled toothbrush . Dentin hypersensitivity examination , include air blast sensitivity cold thermal sensitivity combine visual analog scale Dental Pain Scale , conduct baseline , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 week .

Must diagnose dentin hypersensitivity dentist , least one sensitive tooth demonstrate cervical erosion/abrasion gingival recession As final entrance criterion , sensitive tooth must respond : air sensitivity , Schiff score &gt; 1 , assess use onesecond blast air . thermal sensitivity , assess frozen cotton pellet , pain rating least moderate pain Dental Pain Scale ( DPS ) score 30 80 mm 100 mm scale Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) . Subjects answer YES follow question enrol study : Any history significant adverse effect follow use oral hygiene product toothpastes mouthwash ? Does subject physical limitation restriction might preclude use normal oral hygiene procedure ( i.e. , toothbrushing , mouthrinsing , etc. ) ? The sensitive tooth associate concomitant oral pain due condition : softtissue lesion toothache dental condition like dental caries , etc ? Has subject ever report allergy drug chemical use trial ?

The sensitive tooth associate mobility &gt; 1 ? Did subject participate dental clinical trial involve oral care product within past 30 day ? Is subject pregnant , nurse plan become pregnant course study ( selfreported ) ? Does subject severe , acute chronic medical psychiatric condition laboratory abnormality may increase risk associate trial participation may interfere interpretation trial result , judgment investigator , would make subject inappropriate entry trial ? Does subject significant oral soft tissue pathology , base dentist 's visual examination discretion investigator ? The sensitive tooth associate gum pain gingivitis , occlusal trauma , thermal chemical burn ? Patients pain periodontal related cause dentin hypersensitivity ? Previous professional desensitizing treatment ? Subject use overthecounter desensitizing product within previous 3 month ? Subjects use medication could interfere perception pain ? Eating disorder condition associate vomit ? Systemic condition etiologic predispose dentinal hypersensitivity ? Excessive dietary environmental exposure acid ? The sensitive tooth restore precede 3 month ? The sensitive tooth abutment tooth fixed removable prosthesis ? The sensitive tooth extensive restoration restoration extend test area ?
