	<brief_summary>Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) common sustain cardiac arrhythmia increase morbidity mortality . A catheter-based AF ablation technique isolate pulmonary vein ( PV ) leave atrium establish disrupt AF . Despite significant development , AF ablation pulmonary vein isolation ( PVI ) report success rate 40-80 % various AF population . Persistent AF appear reliant upon fibroblast proliferation myocyte-fibroblast couple paroxysmal AF obvious implication management . Despite knowledge fibrotic substrate responsible perpetuation persistent AF , several ablation technique target extra-pulmonary vein site fail prove additional benefit PVI alone . Nevertheless , two recently develop technology , aim detect AF substrate high precision , seem constitute potential breakthrough management persistent AF . On one hand , late gadolinium-enhanced MRI ( LGE-MRI ) well-established method identify fibrosis myocardium . Recent report single center show MRI-based left atrial fibrosis detection able predict outcome procedure . Hence , target lesion see LGE-MRI set persistent AF option yet explore compare widely adopt , yet suboptimal , PVI . On another hand , novel ablation method promise result focal impulse rotor modulation ( FIRM ) . Undergoing wide sample atria spatiotemporal computational mapping AF identify area stable organize rotational electrical activity ( rotor ) . Several study way prove reproducibility rotor mapping , group report improve rate acute long-term suppression AF ablation FIRM-identified rotor . The SIMPle AF study randomize clinical trial design test hypothesis ablation tailor underlying substrate use either LGE-detected dense scar rotor anchor site predict computational modeling superior anatomic non-tailored PVI ablation patient persistent AF . For present study , investigator plan enroll total 30 patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives The main objective study identify optimal ablation strategy suppression persistent AF . The secondary objective study : - To define local myocardial image characteristic slow conduction AF substrates . - To define local myocardial structural change post ablation associate AF suppression 1-year follow-up - To compare cardiac remodel atrial function 1-year follow-up PVI tailor catheter ablation group Background Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) associate increase risk mortality , heart failure , thromboembolic event , worldwide prevalence &gt; 33.5 million . Catheter ablation AF evolve effective therapy symptomatic AF . Recurrent AF ablation , however , remain problem report associate baseline extent leave atrial ( LA ) late gadolinium enhancement ( LGE ) cardiac magnetic resonance ( CMR ) . Mechanistically , persistent AF appear reliant upon fibroblast proliferation myocyte-fibroblast couple paroxysmal AF , primarily dependent upon pulmonary vein trigger . Therefore , investigator hypothesize substrate persistent AF detectable atrial LGE-CMR variable among patient , substrate predicts patient outcomes anatomic non-tailored ablation , likely respond individually tailor ablation approach . Two individually tailored approach study include empiric target dense LGE , confirm bipolar mapping voltage &lt; 0.3 mV , model base target rotor anchor site . Study Design Initially , investigator propose prospective enrollment 30 participant persistent AF . Patients present institution meet inclusion criterion ask participate study . All patient undergo routine clinical care include echocardiography indicate . All patient undergo LGE-MRI within 30 day prior ablation procedure . The clinical purpose initial MRI define anatomy heart chamber well vessel procedure planning . For research purpose , investigator use initial clinical MRI delineate atrial structural remodel fibrosis use procedure patient randomize group 2 ( pulmonary vein isolation + scar-based ablation ) later analysis patient . Imaging do institution review quality study staff . LGE-MRI sequence meet quality standard fibrosis analysis process patient exclude study . Subjects image successfully evaluate randomize study group . This follow block randomization 1:1:1 format ) pulmonary vein isolation ( PVI ) ( current standard care ) , b ) PVI plus target dense LGE site , confirm bipolar mapping voltage &lt; 0.3 mV , c ) PVI plus target rotor anchor site predict modeling . At baseline , patient evaluate quality life ( QOL ) use Short-form health survey ( SF-36 ) overall well AF-related impact quality life . The severity symptom also test use European Heart Rhythm Association ( EHRA ) score atrial fibrillation . Clinical data store electronically link specific research number . Information link de-identified data patient store lock research office , password-protected file . Only member research team , charge collect clinical information , access file . Individual subject binder contain sign consent form clinical source documentation label use study subject number store lock research office mention previously . A pre-ablation cardiac MRI clinically indicate assess baseline cardiac anatomy prior procedure . Routine LGE protocol use acquire MR image . All patient ask undergo repeat LGE-MRI 12 month ablation . This do research purpose . Renal function routinely monitor prior gadolinium-enhanced MRI standard clinical care . With regard ablation procedure , patient undergo AF ablation . The procedure consist circumferential pulmonary vein lesion electro-anatomical guidance use CARTO ( Biosense Webster Inc. , Diamond Bar , CA ) . Operators use either 3.5mm irrigate tip radiofrequency ablation catheter ( ThermoCool Smart-Touch , Biosense Webster Inc. , Diamond Bar , CA ) cryoballoon catheter ( Arctic Front Advance , Medtronic Inc. , Minneapolis , MN ) . This procedure FDA approve conducted treatment arm accord standard care . However , patient second group undergo additional targeting dense LGE sit , confirm bipolar mapping voltage &lt; 0.3 mV patient third group undergo target rotor anchor site predict computational modeling . A detailed protocol rotor ablation describe literature show add complication compare conventional procedure . To prevent short-term recurrence AF , patient keep anti-arrhythmic regimen first 1 3 month ablation discontinue thereafter absence AF recurrence , discretion treat physician . In addition , standard protocol anticoagulation prior , , ablation procedure apply . After ablation , clinical follow-up visit schedule 3 , 6 12 month . Research follow-up questionnaire 12-lead ECG recording do day visit . All patient undergo rhythm monitoring detect AF recurrence use portable , smart phone operate , AliveCorÂ® Mobile ECG device.This device provide patient cost enrollment study . After procedure , follow-up do weekly basis trans-telephonic transmission ECG recording . Periodic reminder send patient ( via telephone , email , mail ) regard follow transmission event weekly transmission miss . In addition , study participant advise provide recording experience heart-related symptom ( palpitation , shortness breath , rapid heartbeat , chest pain ) . This extensive rhythm monitoring protocol standard care do research purpose . Review rhythm monitor data perform accordance current clinical guideline . The device software investigator analyze rhythm strip report available research team treat physician upon his/her request . In addition , upon detection arrhythmia important clinical implication , investigator notify electrophysiologist involve care patient . The research team may contact patient directly prompt action advise , report local emergency room follow electrophysiologist . The rhythm monitoring protocol utilized study may result unscheduled visit physician . If repeat ablation procedure indicate , schedule accord standard clinical care . Study duration visit . The investigator aim complete propose study protocol two year . After ablation , patient follow 3 , 6 12 month via clinic visit ; 1 month 9 month follow take place via remote ECG transmission . Follow-up research questionnaires post-ablation MRI schedule coincide routine clinical visit . Hence , additional visit require research participant unless possible schedule MRI day clinic visit . Only investigator ask participant present institution follow-up MRI . Study Statistics Based variable success rate 40-80 % AF ablation , investigator anticipate study cohort 30 patient would produce adequate sample size treatment arm sufficient make meaningful statistical comparison . Comparison variable present mean +/- standard deviation , categorical variable number percentage . Differences treatment group assess use Pearson Chi-square test Wilcoxon rank-sum test .
