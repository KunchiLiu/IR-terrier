	<brief_title>Perioperative Chemo Pembrolizumab Gastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gastric cancer one common cancer worldwide . Surgical resection primary treatment gastric cancer patient present locally advanced disease recurrence common surgery . Many patient ( 35 % ) early recurrence within 6-9 month surgery indicate need aggressive upfront therapy subject . In addition , majority patient ultimately recurrence 5 year survival rate 35-40 % despite aggressive therapy . The ability combine immunotherapy pembrolizumab give potential increase therapeutic option continue standard care chemotherapy . The particular use maintenance therapy may delay eliminate growth residual micrometastatic disease lead durable disease control . Additionally , study provide foundation substantial correlative work define tumor patient characteristic may predict response pembrolizumab gastric cancer . This non-randomized , multi-site , open-label trial pembrolizumab chemotherapy subject gastric gastroesophageal ( GE ) junction adenocarcinoma .</detailed_description>
