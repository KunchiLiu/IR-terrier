	<brief_summary>Using stable isotope methodology , investigator determine postabsorptive postprandial muscle protein synthetic response 60 female adult ( Age 50-79 , BMI : &lt; 30 kg/m2 ) immediately acute bout resistance exercise . Participants divide 5 group twelve woman ( n=12 ) . Each group receive different protein beverage placebo consume follow resistance exercise training . Group 1 consume beverage consist whey protein ; group 2 consume whey protein supplement additional leucine ; group 3 consume whey protein supplement additional leucine hydrolyze whey peptide ; group 4 consume whey protein supplement additional leucine citrulline ; group 5 consume water . During test , blood muscle sample collect .</brief_summary>
