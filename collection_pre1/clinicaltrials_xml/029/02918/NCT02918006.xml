	<brief_title>A Phase 2 Influenza A Challenge Study Following Oral Administration H1N1 HA Ad-Vector Seasonal Flu Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 2 randomize , placebo- active-controlled , two-part study healthy adult volunteer low undetectable pre-existing antibody A/California/7/2009 ( H1N1 ) pdm09-like virus challenge influenza A/H1N1 human challenge strain approximately 90 day vaccination single dose H1N1 HA Adenoviral-vector base seasonal influenza vaccine dsRNA adjuvant ( VXA-A1.1 ) , injectable QIV vaccine , and/or placebo . An independent SMC oversee safety study . To accommodate limited size isolation unit utilized challenge post-challenge sequestration period , subject move study ( enrollment , vaccination challenge ) sequentially total 6 cohort . Each cohort randomize 30 subject obtain approximately 25 subject per cohort challenge phase . Subjects randomize ratio 2:2:1 ( VXA-A1.1 : QIV : Placebo ) . The study conduct two part . Part A : Subjects randomize double-blinded manner receive single administration one three treatment arm : - Arm 1 : VXA-A1.1 oral vaccine + placebo IM - Arm 2 : QIV IM injection + oral placebo - Arm 3 : Placebo IM injection + oral placebo Subjects return site ~8 visit contact remotely defined time point follow immunogenicity safety study Part A . Part B : Subjects challenge wild-type influenza A H1 virus strain ~90 day follow vaccination . Blood sample collect evaluate immunogenicity . Subjects remain isolation unit 6 9 day post-challenge . Following challenge , influenza symptom sign assessed sequestration period . Blood sample nasopharyngeal swab sample collect . Vital sign measure every 4 hour wake hour . After release isolation unit subject return site 30 day post-challenge . Part B continue purpose collect long term safety follow-up ( SAEs AESIs/NOCIs ) via phone contact 1 year post-vaccination ( Day 365 ) .</detailed_description>
