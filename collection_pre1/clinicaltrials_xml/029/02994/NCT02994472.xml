	<brief_summary>The Investigators institution use meal consist mash potato , peas Beanfeast ( soya mince ) gastric empty study number decade . Validation study method purportedly perform study first implement hospital , however historical data find . The current normal range also unsubstantiated . There scientific justification research vivo study instrumental validation new procedure . There need meal preparation palatable meet dietary requirement ( vegetarian , gluten free e.t.c . ) patient diagnosis depend ingestion radiolabelled meal . In addition , reliable normal range ensure clinical diagnosis accurate . Scientific justification extend beyond local department publishing data acquire allow hospital adopt test meal normal range , lead standardisation clinical protocol employ across UK . Since investigator institution recognise leading Nuclear Medicine GI centre UK previously carry audits vitro test area gastric emptying , seem fit lead national change protocol . The propose study involve recruitment healthy volunteer eat meal contain 10MBq radioactive tracer . They subsequently scan use gamma camera image last 3 hour total . Approximately 40 healthy volunteer ( 18-70 year old , history gastrointestinal problem serious health issue e.g . diabetes pregnant woman exclude ) recruit study conduct site i.e . within Nuclear Medicine department City hospital .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>After ingestion subsequent passage solid liquid material stomach , gastric content undergo gastric empty stomach intestine . The rate gastric empty variable depend presence gastric pathology defect , composition volume gastric content may even influence factor gender reproductive status . Gastric motility disorder gastroparesis dump syndrome affect rate gastric empty thus warrant quantitative assessment empty . Gastroparesis disorder stomach characterise delay gastric empty absence mechanical obstruction categorise base severity ; mild gastroparesis ( symptom easily control ) , compensate gastroparesis ( partial control use medication dietary adjustment ) gastric failure ( symptom controllable ) . Dumping syndrome occurs result rapid gastric empty usually associate hypermotility stomach . It manifest either early late dumping syndrome , distinct physiological base clinical presentation . Typical symptom delay empty include nausea , vomit , abdominal pain abdominal fullness eat whilst diarrhoea , weakness light headedness meal time common symptom rapid empty . In Nuclear Medicine department City Hospital ( Birmingham ) , patient refer image usually diabetic suffer feeling bloatedness eat occasional vomiting . Most patient study clinically diagnosed gastroparesis associate diabetes ( vagus nerve responsible control movement food digestive tract stop function ) . Dumping rarely report effective tablet treatment disorder usually ease symptom . ( This include octreotide therapy exert effect various mechanism delay transit , inhibit release gut peptide impair fluid secretion ) . If leave untreated gastroparesis make diabetes bad make difficult manage blood glucose . Assessment gastric empty rate therefore important part diagnosis . Gastric empty scintigraphy non-invasive diagnostic tool use Nuclear Medicine study empty content stomach . This form scintigraphic examination reproducible , simple perform , accurate , quantitative expose patient small radiation dose . It significantly optimise refined year well established standard method evaluate gastric empty . As 'gold standard ' gastric empty scintigraphy usually first stage diagnostic journey patient , although may prior endoscopy ( usually case severe vomit ) . The procedure know vary institution , however usually involve bind radiotracer solid liquid meal administer orally . This follow positioning patient front camera continuous intermittent imaging perform . Data acquire length time ( usually 1-2 hour ) data subsequently analyse determine half empty time ( i.e . time required stomach empty 50 % ingested meal ) compare establish normal range ( i.e . normal empty rate expect healthy individual ) . The current radioactive meal use study consist mash potato , peas Beanfeast ( soya mince ) particularly palatable , meet dietary requirement patient ( e.g . gluten/wheat free ) difficult prepare . In addition , in-house vitro study find current meal inferior meal preparation . Subjecting radioactive meal simulate condition stomach find radiolabel retention significantly well meal scramble egg porridge .</detailed_description>
