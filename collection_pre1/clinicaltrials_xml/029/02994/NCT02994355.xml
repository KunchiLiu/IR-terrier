	<detailed_description>Integration HIV treatment prevention family planning ( FP ) service promise approach optimize delivery comprehensive healthcare HIV-positive woman , well prevention service negative . The need integration service evident Africa , bear disproportionate burden HIV , high birth rate , maternal mortality . A high increase proportion African woman use FP service , make potentially efficient venue reach . Testing HIV gateway care prevention . Integrating HIV test FP clinic could open essential gateway , decrease stigma associate seek HIV test reduce cost . The antenatal setting provide useful example . In many African country , test HIV antenatal clinic ( ANCs ) become routine . Diagnosis HIV pregnancy pave way substantial reduction mother-to-child transmission HIV AIDS-related death woman reproductive age . These achievement demonstrate feasibility impact wide-scale HIV test exist reproductive health service . In contrast ANCs , integration HIV test FP service remain formative stage much Africa . Recent reviews support feasibility integrating service , invariably conclude additional research need . In Kenya , National AIDS STD Control Program ( NASCOP ) state FP clinic setting , `` Failure offer HIV test counsel unacceptable , consider negligent . '' However , almost operational assessment HIV test Kenyan FP clinic . In Mombasa County , USAID-supported AIDS Population Health Integrated Assistance II Program revise FP Clinic Register capture HIV testing 2008 . However , rate HIV test FP clinic remain low , County request assistance address prevention gap . Colleagues University Washington Department Global Health develop system analysis performance enhancement approach , use industrial system engineering technique , investigator believe useful setting . The overarch objective ass effectiveness , cost , budget impact implement system analysis improvement approach ( SAIA ) increase HIV test FP clinic Mombasa County . The investigator specific aim follow : AIM 1 : To conduct cluster-randomized trial compare effect SAIA approach versus usual procedure rate HIV test first-time attendee 12 intervention versus 12 control FP clinic Mombasa County , Kenya . HYP 1 : After one year study team support implement SAIA vs. usual procedure , high proportion first-time FP clinic attendee test HIV intervention compare control facility AIM 2 : To determine whether SAIA train result last effect , investigator compare HIV test rate first-time FP clinic attendee SAIA intervention versus control facility additional year , FP clinic intervention arm encourage continue use SAIA tool minimal support study team . The Mombasa County Ministry Health take ownership implementation phase . HYP 2 : After additional year minimal support study team , continue significantly high rate HIV test first-time FP clinic attendee intervention compare control facility . AIM 3 : To estimate incremental cost budget impact apply SAIA versus standard care . Using activity-based approach , investigator perform cost analysis , estimate cost per new HIV diagnosis , active support study team period without active support . The investigator also estimate cost scale , conduct budget impact analysis Department Health ( DOH ) perspective . Expected Outcome Significance : The investigator anticipate SAIA approach produce significant sustain improvement HIV-testing rate first-time FP clinic attendee intervention clinic compare control facility . The use rigorous study design evaluate scalable approach provide strong evidence guide integration HIV test FP service wide range setting . The inclusion cost budget impact analyse assist policy maker reach informed decision implementation . By address crucial first step linkage HIV FP service , research hold considerable promise improve woman 's health opening gateway HIV care prevention . Preliminary data linkage care prevention service inform development future grant proposal .</detailed_description>
