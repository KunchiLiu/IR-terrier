	<brief_title>GIS-SUSANTI-TNF-2015 ( Anti-TNF Discontinuation )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A multicentre prospective randomize trial . Hypothesis : The discontinuation anti-TNF treatment inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) patient clinical remission associate increase risk recurrence compare maintain treatment . Main objective : To assess percentage patient IBD , stop anti-TNF treatment , sustain clinical remission one year compare treatment continue stable dos Secondary objective : To compare treatment discontinuation vs. treatment continuation anti-TNF agent patient CrohnÂ´s disease ulcerative colitis term : 1. remission ( relapse-free ) time , 2. phenotype change strategies 3. mucosal healing , 4. radiologic heal 5. impact quality life productivity 6. safety 7. identify relapse predictive factor . 8 . To identify relapse predictive factor anti-TNF drug discontinuation 9 . Determining profile serum cytokine patient strategy , depend drug exposure maintain clinical remission relapse . Planned number subject include : 300 The participation 25 hospital Spain inclusion 12 patient per hospital required.. Case report Form design REDCap ( free , secure , web-based application design support data capture research study ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients diagnose IBD ( Crohn 's disease ulcerative colitis ) Patients diagnose IBD usual criterion ; Crohn 's ulcerative colitis disease . Patients older 18 year . Have receive treatment antiTNF drug induce clinical remission IBD clinical practice . Being first antiTNF drug receive first course drug . In case patient Crohn 's disease indication treatment antiTNF must luminal involvement ( perianal ) . Are currently clinical remission . The pretreatment period antiTNF must least 1 year ( stable dos last year ) . The clinical remission period must least 6 month . At time inclusion , patient receive concomitant immunosuppressant ( thiopurine methotrexate ) antiTNF treatment , must receive immunosuppressive drug stable dos least last 3 month . In patient Crohn 's disease ulcerative colitis disease , baseline colonoscopy ( make 30 day inclusion ) `` significant '' injury . In case patient Crohn 's ileal ileocolic disease , magnetic resonance whole `` significant '' injury . PRINCIPAL EXCLUSION CRITERIA Age less 18 year . Patients treat antiTNF indication IBD . Patients , point , receive antiTNF drug dose high standard , intensify ; , 5 mg / kg / 8 week , case infliximab , 40 mg / 2 week , case adalimumab . Patients Crohn 's disease indication treatment antiTNF perianal involvement ( luminal perianal ) ; show active perianal disease time inclusion . Patients previously discontinue treatment antiTNF subsequently restart . Patients previously receive another antiTNF drug . Patients IBD begin treatment antiTNF clinical remission . Patients receive concomitant treatment immunosuppressant ( thiopurine methotrexate ) moment ( previous 3 month ) . Patients undergo bowel resection surgery ; therefore , patient begin antiTNF therapy prevent treat postoperative recurrence Crohn 's disease exclude . Presence `` significant '' endoscopic radiological lesion Advanced chronic illness condition prevents patient come clinic monitoring followup . Patients pregnant , breastfeed intend become pregnant course study . Refusal give consent participation study .</criteria>
