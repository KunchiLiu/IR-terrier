Secondary Objectives 1 . Investigate whether inclusion HIVST option HIV test addition offer HIV test finger-prick blood sample CHW increase uptake offer HIV-testing among specific sub-populations include men , adolescent individual previously test relative offer HIV test finger-prick blood sample alone . 2 . Investigate whether inclusion HIVST option HIV test addition offer HIV test finger-prick blood sample CHW increase proportion individual ' diagnose HIV positive relative offer HIV test finger-prick blood sample alone . 3 . Measure linkage HIV treatment care , prevention service HIVST include option HIV test addition offer HIV test finger-prick blood sample CHW level couples-testing . Trial Design This cluster randomise trial randomise community health worker zone ( 66 total ) either distribute oral HIVST kit addition offer finger-prick rapid HIV testing ( 33 zone ) offer finger-prick rapid HIV test alone ( 33 zone ) . The trial nest within theHPTN071/PopART trial CHWs randomise work 4 intervention site study . Trial location Four community Copperbelt Central province Zambia chosen participate trial . Trial Participants All adult adolescent age 16 year old living community eligible participation consent participate household visit eligible HIV testing ( individual age 16 year old report know HIV status ) . The CHW use electronic data capture device collect information . Process Evaluation Measures Data Collection Process evaluation data collect use standardise data collection form develop trial , include form collect data many CHW attend train demonstration HIVST number HIVST kit procure . Data also collect : 1 ) . number household visit offer option HIVST door-to-door rapid finger-prick HIV testing , follow-up visit individual receive HIVST kit ( ) . number community engagement activity perform inform community availability HIVST kit . Data number household visit collected exist EDC device data community activity collect routine monitoring data . Expected output , namely number HIVST kit distribute use individual present absent time household visit , also collect exist EDC device . Data outcomes interest collect exist EDC device , linkage data extract use form develop HPTN071 qualitative data collection , include acceptability HIVST distribution CHW . Measured part Process Evaluation The following measure estimate qualitative quantitative data collection part process evaluation : Inputs : How many CHW train deliver intervention ? How many HIVST kit procure ? How many meeting CABs , community mobilisers stakeholds hold ? And many attendee meeting ? Activities : How many door-to-door visit conduct ? How many communication activity hold community ? Outputs : How many HIVST kit distribute ? Were community aware HIVST intervention obtain HIVST kit ? Was HIVST acceptable ? How perceived community member ? Ethical Considerations The trial conduct accordance Good Clinical Practice guideline , research staff receive GCP training . The Ethics Committees approve study Biomedical Ethics Committee University Zambia ethic committee London School Hygiene Tropical Medicine .

For individual absent time household visit , index HIV test client ask whether agree accept HIVST behalf absent household member provide demonstration perform test individual . This individual ask sign agreement statement , state give self-test kit spouse/partner . The absent individual decline/opt-out use HIVST make clear individual accept HIVST . Individuals participate in-depth qualitative study ask provide write inform research consent . Potential Harms Despite increased availability HIV testing service , include door-to-door offer home-based HIV testing , test HIV remain sensitive issue subject stigma discrimination . HIV self-testing provide individual confidentiality opportunity avoid stigma see access HIV testing service clinic . Nonetheless , self-testing may pose harm distinct facility- community-based HIV testing strategy , include concern coercion test .
