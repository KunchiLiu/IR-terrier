	<brief_title>A Phase I Study With Lymfactin® Treatment Patients With Secondary Lymphedema</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open label , multi-center , uncontrolled first human trial use standard 3 + 3 dose escalation scheme . Lymfactin® administer single dose ex vivo perinodal injection fat pad flap tissue contain lymph node abdominal wall . This flap tissue surgically implant axillary region affect arm . This treatment Lymfactin® may perform conjunction without breast reconstruction surgery . Up two dose cohort plan include . Each dose Lymfactin® administer single dose via perinodal injection volume 2 mL : - Cohort 1 : Lymfactin® [ 1 x 10E10 vp ] - Cohort 2 : Lymfactin® [ 1 x 10E11 vp ] Should dose escalation go Cohort 2 total 18 patient may treat study .</detailed_description>
