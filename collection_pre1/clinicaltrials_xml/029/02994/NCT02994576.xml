The role immunotherapeutic approach NSCLC neoadjuvant set currently unknown . However , base survival efficacy immunotherapeutic strategy advance NSCLC tumor remove could produce high immunogenicity base efficacy neoadjuvant treatment NSCLC , propose test safety efficacy atezolizumab neoadjuvant therapy subject diagnose stage IB , II , IIIA ( non N2 ) NSCLC deem suitable surgical resection .
