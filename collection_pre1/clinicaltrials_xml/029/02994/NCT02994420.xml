	<detailed_description>Obesity associate severe consequence health , i.e . cardiovascular disease Diabetes Type 2 reach world-wide level epidemic excessive eating major cause development . Study result veterinary physiology well woman let assume steroid hormone , estrogen progesterone highly involved regulation eat behavior female body weight . This connection underpin fact prevalence adiposity increase woman comparison men United States , Switzerland country . A good understanding underlying regulatory mechanism , turn influence food intake gut system release satiety hormone well central regulative mechanism brain , provide important foundation long-term development new prophylactic therapeutic option reduction prevention obesity . This get even important , current therapeutic option - beside bariatric surgery - could show limited success . Satiety process brain lead meal end , whereby ingest food cause reflexive negative feedback mechanism . This mechanism fundamentally specifically acute situation strongly influence subjective parameter , e.g . eat desire , socio-cultural factor , current social circumstance individual relation towards eat . Furthermore , food intake also influence genetic factor , whereas e.g . TaqIA1 allele know associated obesity . According current knowledge , regulation take place peripheral well central level , whereas steroid hormone also satiety hormone - especially cholecystokinin ( CCK ) glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) - involve level . The current study aim examine connection steroid hormone , gastrointestinal satiety hormone neuronal activity brain fMRI . Through obtain data , interaction define hormone constellation , gastrointestinal satiety hormone activation specific brain area obese normal-weight woman evaluate . The study design involve comparison subjective , hedonic evaluation different flavoured liquid different caloric content rating scale well objective peripheral ( release CCK GLP-1 ) central ( activation involve brain centre fMRI ) regulation process fast fed condition woman two study group ( obese normal-weighted ) late follicular compare luteal phase ovarian cycle .</detailed_description>
