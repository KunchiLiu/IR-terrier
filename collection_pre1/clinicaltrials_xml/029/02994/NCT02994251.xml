	<brief_title>A Trial Systemic Chemotherapy Combination With Conventional Transarterial Chemoembolization Patients With Advanced Intra-Hepatic Cholangiocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eligible patient enrol study receive chemotherapy regimen gemcitabine cisplatin administer intravenously Days 1 8 21-day cycle . After every 2 cycle systemic chemotherapy , patient receive contrast-enhanced MRI ass liver disease ; conventional trans-arterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) perform indicate base assessment . Patients receive maximum 8 cycle gemcitabine/cisplatin combination . Up 3 TACE treatment may deliver time frame , first TACE take place 2 cycle systemic chemotherapy . Following treatment period , patient continue clinical follow-up 3 month interval study exit 18 month post start treatment . It hypothesize addition conventional transarterial chemoembolization standard chemotherapy result improvement PFS patient advance , unresectable ICC , include patient extra-hepatic disease .</detailed_description>
