	<brief_summary>Cystic fibrosis ( CF ) common fatal inherited condition Caucasians , cause recurrent chest infection premature death due lung failure . When patient develop chest infection symptom usually slowly worsen course several day week . Due gradual onset , patient often seek medical attention several day week symptoms start worsen . The Investigators believe able monitor patient closely could diagnose treat chest infection earlier consequently improve health outcome . The HOMECF study aim investigate whether home monitoring beneficial adult CF . 100 subject randomly allocate , 50 receive home monitoring 50 receive routine clinical care 12 month . Subjects receive home monitoring measure lung function symptom twice weekly data transmit medical team mean modify mobile phone . Investigators hypothesize home monitoring allow diagnose chest infection earlier stage reduce hospital inpatient day . They also assess subject ' experience receiving home monitoring , impact body weight lung function conduct full health economic analysis ass value money . They also ask subject collect urine sample weekly allow u measure urinary level inflammatory marker . Subjects recruit West Midlands Adult CF Centre Birmingham . The research team well place carry study large regional adult CF centre excellent record conduct clinical research .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The principal question answer research study : 1 . Does home monitoring reduce total number inpatient hospital day adults cystic fibrosis ( CF ) compare routine clinical care ? The secondary objective research study ass : 1 . The effect home monitoring lung function adult cystic fibrosis ( CF ) 2 . The effect home monitoring requirement antibiotic adult CF 3 . The effect home monitoring nutritional status adult CF 4 . The effect home monitoring health relate quality life adult CF 5 . Costeffectiveness analysis compare home monitoring period routine clinical care period 6 . The patient experience receive home monitoring adult CF 7 . Whether urine level inflammatory marker correlate symptom lung function adult CF The aim study ass whether home monitoring beneficial adult cystic fibrosis . Overall , 100 subject recruit West Midlands Adult Centre randomly allocate 1:1 ratio receive home monitoring routine clinical care 12 month .</detailed_description>
