	<brief_summary>People obese often insulin resistance ( inability insulin properly control blood sugar ) high blood sugar . However , people obesity problem . About one third people obesity normal sugar metabolism ( way body use sugar ) . The reason people obesity problem blood sugar control others entirely clear . It think impaired muscle sugar uptake main problem relate high blood sugar people obesity . However , adipose tissue ( fat tissue ) also consume substantial amount blood sugar . Therefore , unclear whether muscle adipose tissue ( fat tissue ) primarily responsible altered blood sugar concentration person metabolically abnormal obesity ( MAO ) ( insulin resistance high blood sugar ) , compare metabolically normal ( healthy ) obesity ( MNO ) , whether `` healthy '' adipose tissue ( fat tissue ) expansion MNO people compare lean people provide vessel blood sugar removal help maintain normal blood sugar concentration . Accordingly , investigator determine amount sugar take body cell adipose tissue ( fat tissue ) muscle infuse label sugar blood look disappearance blood appearance adipose tissue ( fat tissue ) muscle . The investigator also determine well insulin , hormone control blood sugar , turn signal stimulate sugar uptake fat muscle cell . These study do overnight fast infusion sugar insulin ( hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp ) , sex- age-matched MNO MAO people group sex- age-matched healthy lean people .</brief_summary>
