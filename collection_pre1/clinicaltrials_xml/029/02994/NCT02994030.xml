	<brief_title>Biomarker Patients With Duchenne Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( DMD ) rare muscle disorder one frequent genetic condition affect approximately 1 3,500 male birth worldwide . It usually recognize three six year age . DMD characterize weakness wasting ( atrophy ) muscle pelvic area follow involvement shoulder muscle . As disease progress , muscle weakness atrophy spread affect trunk forearm gradually progress involve additional muscle body . In addition , calf appear enlarge patient . The disease progressive affected individual require wheelchair teenage year . Serious life-threatening complication may ultimately develop include disease heart muscle ( cardiomyopathy ) breathing ( respiratory ) difficulty . New method , like mass-spectrometry give good chance characterize specific metabolic alteration blood ( plasma ) affect patient allow diagnose future disease earlier , high sensitivity specificity . Therefore goal study identify validate new biochemical marker plasma affect patient help benefit patient early diagnose thereby earlier treatment .</detailed_description>
