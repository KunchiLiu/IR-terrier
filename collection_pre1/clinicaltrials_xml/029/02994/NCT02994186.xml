	<brief_summary>Bariatric surgery effective , long-term treatment morbid obesity , consistent previous finding , individual lose significant weight surgery also improve cognition `` brain function '' . The mechanism behind cognitive improvement currently unknown , focus much research effort . The goal pilot study thoroughly describe change surgical versus medical weight loss patient time repeat measure fashion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Examination Cognitive Function Obesity Following Weight Loss</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent study demonstrate obesity associate decreased cognitive function , interestingly , weight loss associate improved cognitive function . Bariatric surgery effective , long-term treatment morbid obesity , consistent previous finding , individual lose significant weight surgery appear improve cognition . Previous result report appearance cognitive improvement start three month postoperatively , thus , main focus study discover whether cognitive function improvement see early one month bariatric surgery . An acceleration onset cognitive function change could provide insight towards ambiguous underlie neural mechanism . The benefit bariatric surgery extend beyond reversible cognitive deficit . Many medical comorbid condition patient surgery ( e.g . high blood pressure , high cholesterol , diabetes ) typically resolve prior significant weight loss . The mechanisms weight-independent improvement also undetermined . A secondary focus study determine whether cognitive function follow bariatric surgery also improve prior significant weight loss . To test whether cognitive function change follow bariatric surgery , two cohort surgical patient recruit well another group patient undergo medical weight loss treatment . The goal pilot study reproduce expand upon previous finding demonstrate cognitive improvement follow bariatric surgery .</detailed_description>
