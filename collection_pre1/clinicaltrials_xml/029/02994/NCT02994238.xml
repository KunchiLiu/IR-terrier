	<detailed_description>Objective : To improve overall asthma control asthma management among child 4-11 year old moderate-to-severe asthma . Study Aims : For child 4-11 year old moderate severe asthma investigator : 1 ) Determine factor influence clinical psychosocial outcome . The investigator use Clinical chart review data , well parent report follow clinical outcome measure : 1 ) Oral corticosteroid use ; 2 ) Emergency Department ( ED ) visit 3 ) hospitalization ; 4 ) Asthma Control Test ( ACT ) . Predictors outcomes include patient demographic , asthma severity , co-morbidities , parent physician management factor ( measure aim 2 3 ) assess . Investigators use parent-report survey follow psychosocial outcome measure : 1 . Days miss school and/or work due asthma ; 2 ) pediatric asthma-related quality life ( PACQLQ ) ; 3 ) Parental Asthma Management Self-Efficacy ( PAMSE ) . 2 . Enhance parental management improve inhaler use . The investigator use Propeller Sensor Platform ( referenced Remote Health Management Platform ) allow parent track child 's ICS SABA inhaler use daily ( please see appendix list inhaler compatible ) . The Platform also specific educational messaging help parent child achieve adherence prescribed plan . This constant feedback reinforcement may lead improved asthma control therefore reduce frequency severity asthma exacerbation . The investigator also assess factor associate feasibility sustainability Propeller Sensor Platform observe trend utilization . Utilization drop-off measure monitoring use inhaler periodic surveys family . 3 . Improve management healthcare team . The investigator use Remote Health Management Platform integrate inhaler use data web portal physician 's office access . Through development interface , Propeller Sensor Platform able provide inhaler use feedback healthcare team . Types feedback : - Emergency Management : data inhale corticosteroid ( ICS ) short-acting beta-agonist ( SABA ) use - Long-term Management : data ICS SABA use This interface include data ICS SABA inhaler use . The interface also flag notify office overuse inhaler , protocol place reach patient . The investigator also assess factor associate feasibility sustainability Remote Health Management Platform healthcare team . This do weekly contact healthcare team , rapid cycle improvement web portal , write assessment .</detailed_description>
