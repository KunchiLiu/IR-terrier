	<brief_summary>In 2011 , premier Canadian province territory select diabetes foot care one three significant target pan-provincial action . The Diabetes Foot Care Clinical Pathway Project ( DFCCPP ) aim optimize method early detection treatment foot ulcer effort reduce low limb amputation ( LLA ) 50 % . The DFCCPP key deliverable apply consistency assessment , care , treatment process standard , early intervention complex wind care management , optimize health outcome . To achieve deliverable , High Risk Foot Teams ( HRFTs ) implement across province start three pilot site ( Slave Lake , Brooks , outpatient clinic Peter Lougheed Hospital ) . The pilot site facility select basis employ staff expertise knowledge diabetic foot care . The HRFT ass treat patient moderate high-risk finding , care pathway roll clinician perform diabetic foot assessment ( Primary Care , Home Care , Diabetes Centers , First Nations Reserves , etc. ) . In conjunction DFCCPP , evaluate efficacy technological device develop Alberta-based small-medium enterprise ( SME ) improve diabetic foot outcome prevent future wound high-risk patient recently treat active foot ulcer . This technology SurroSense Rx® smart insole system ( Orpyx Medical Technologies Inc. , Calgary AB ) , device provide dynamic offload guidance patient , addition enable ongoing adherence track HRFT . It hypothesize early wound detection treatment ultimately lead improvement wound prevalence , chronic wound care , reduce need surgical intervention , include LLA .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Canadian Institute Health Information estimate foot wound ( diabetes lead cause ) present 4 % hospital inpatient , 7 % homecare client 10 % long-term care ( LTC ) resident . Of 210,000 people diabetes Alberta , 5,250 seek treatment foot ulcer annually . In Alberta 2014-15 425 LLAs perform 309 diabetic patient represent increase 89 LLA 2010-11 . Moreover , tremendous reduction quality life patient attendant negative effect family . The 5-year mortality rate new-onset diabetic foot ulcer 43-55 % , high 74 % patient undergoing LLA . Continuous monitoring diabetic foot preventative foot care utmost importance patient diabetes . This especially case high risk patient previously foot ulcer . Improving standardize diabetic foot screening , early wound detection treatment ultimately lead improvement wound prevalence , chronic wound care , need surgical intervention , include amputation . Effective pressure offload key tenet diabetic ulcer prevention care . The effectiveness offload intervention intimately link skin reperfusion see persistent external pressure alleviate . Key modifiable parameter mitigate tissue damage neuropathic foot pressure time . Exposures 15 min one hour pressure great 240 mmHg , two hour pressure great 67 mmHg , find cause cell death rat muscle tissue . Despite , limited information regard efficacy intervention aim preventing pressure ulcer ; comprehensive review literature find enough evidence recommend reposition frequency . A consensus document international review pressure ulcer prevention state `` patient confine wheelchair taught reposition every 15 minute '' . While establish pressure offload intervention able statically reduce pressure active ulcer , provide dynamic relief pressure . Since neuropathy characterize loss protective sensation ( LOPS ) , patient often unaware sustained pressure specific anatomic region time . Even static offload instrument , conceivable critical pressure time threshold dynamically exceed without patient 's knowledge ability address problem . Taken together , literature provide support system monitor pressure time key location , provide alert-based feedback guide as-needed , patient-based offloading use patient active ulceration . Orpyx Medical Technologies Inc. ( Orpyx ) , develop smart insole technology ( `` SurroSense Rx® '' ) sense pressure point user'splantar foot . This important pressure `` hot spot '' lead wound development , leave untreated , progress foot ulcer LLA . Individuals able maintain low in-shoe peak pressure 60 % low risk foot ulcer recurrence . Unpublished study device demonstrate 83 % relative risk reduction plantar ulceration active versus control arm . This device provide dynamic offload guidance patient , addition enable ongoing adherence tracking . This device show effective treatment management diabetic foot patient risk ulcer , respect care active ulcer , addition prevention future recurrence . Wearers SurroSense Rx® technology provide demand cue offload , therefore enhance responsiveness self-control foot care , thereby lead reduction re-ulcerative event thus , LLA . The SurroSense Rx® system patent pending ( US Publication 20120109013 PCT WO/2012/055029 ) footwear system intend prevent first recurrent plantar ulcer , treat active ulcer neuropathic patient . It comprise two pressure-sensing insert smartwatch display device . The device alert user `` safe '' pressure time threshold exceed ; current threshold base result comprehensive review literature , indicate conservative threshold would &gt; 30-50mmHg &gt; 15 minute . As plantar pressure outcome data collect time , threshold may modify need . The device measure plantar pressure discrete point correspond bony prominence would consider high risk ulceration : first metatarsal head ( 1 ) , lateral metatarsal head ( 2 ) , great toe ( 1 ) , lateral toe ( 1 ) , lateral foot ( 2 ) , heel ( 1 ) . These area select base inherent high risk neuropathic ulceration anatomic location . This data track , analysis perform collect last 15 minute . If &gt; 95 % measurement take pressure sensor 15-minute scan window exceed 30-50 mmHg , alert send user via smartwatch guide appropriately offload area . The SurroSense Rx® device use adjunct treatment pathway follow closure diabetic foot wound . It widely acknowledge , follow wound healing , 50-100 % diabetic foot ulcer recur five-year period . What , estimate 18 month , 42 % ulcer recur , half recur first six month . Thus , first six month follow wound heal sensitive time recurrence ulceration . It critical patient population fit SurroSense Rx® device secondary prevention ulceration . Taken together , diabetes patient foot wound elevate risk infection LLA . Therefore , need effective tool prevention management diabetic foot . Research Question Objectives : Does improve standardize foot screen diabetes patient DFCCP concurrently use SurroSense Rx® smart insole system reduce proportion foot ulcer recurrence compare patient receive standard care ? The objective proposal demonstrate combine DFCCP , SurroSense Rx® smart insole system device effective modality superior current standard care prevent recurrence heal pressure ulceration foot subject diabetic peripheral neuropathy low extremity . It hypothesize use device lead reduction risk pressure ulcer recurrence Intervention group improve subject ' foot self-care , compare subject Control group . Over long term anticipate use technology concert DFCCP result well foot health diabetic patient . The ability test efficacy SurroSense Rx® device parallel DFCCP implementation allow evaluation real-world setting patient also access HRFT prescription device . High Risk Foot Teams implement across province start three pilot site ( Slave Lake , Brooks , Diabetic Foot Limb Preservation Centre Peter Lougheed Hospital ) , These pilot site select facility exist staff expertise knowledge diabetic foot care . The HRFT ass treat patient moderate high-risk finding . The AICE-funded project sub-study . All patient clinically assess standardized manner use Alberta Foot Risk Assessment Form ( AFRAF ) , incorporate standardize wound assessment treatment approach.ces , ongoing assessment embed evaluation .</detailed_description>
