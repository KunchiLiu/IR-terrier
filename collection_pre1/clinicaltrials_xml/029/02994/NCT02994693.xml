	<brief_title>Natural History Barrett 's Esophagus Using Tethered Capsule Endomicroscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The MGH first site multi-center study begin enrol . At MGH 100 subject previous diagnosis Barrett 's Esophagus ( BE ) enrol . Each subject undergo minimum 2 esophagogastroduodenoscopies ( EGD ) , one around time inclusion study one end study , 4 TCE imaging session ( baseline , 1-year , 2-years end 3-years follow-up ) . If determine treat physician additional EGDs need , extend follow-up treatment , capsule imaging perform whenever possible . Patients receive write information prior day capsule procedure patient another chance discus procedure study coordinator clinical study staff consent process prior capsule procedure . Participation study completely voluntary , patient stop procedure time . For imaged patient , inclusion criterion clinical characteristic age , sex , body mass index ( BMI ) , current medication regimen , smoke history GI related history record clinical form . Subjects seat asked sip water facilitate swallowing capsule . The device operate experienced study staff train procedure register nurse one endoscopist co-investigators study . Emergency phone and/or pager contact collaborate GI clinician ( ) provide . They also accessible procedure problem encounter require expertise . Imaging perform manner current IRB approve tethered capsule endomicroscopy study . The capsule position control manually via tether outside subject 's mouth catheter operator . Recorded real-time cross-sectional image display monitor distance mark tether use confirmation capsule position esophagus . Images view real time determine capsule reach stomach . The resistance tether also give information cardia position . Once stomach , capsule gradually pull back esophagus mouth , also image . The capsule may reposition image 4 time 4 time esophagus . The subject may ask swallow different size capsule ( range 5-12.8 mm diameter 20-30 cm length ) obtain best distal esophageal image . It expect maximum experimental time include swallow capsule , image procedure , removal capsule take approximately 10 minute total .</detailed_description>
