	<brief_summary>In previous study Appalachian State University ( ASU ) Human Performance Laboratory North Carolina Research Campus ( NCRC ) , investigator show cyclist ingest one-half banana water every 15 minute cycle 75-km faster ( 5 % ) water alone . The polyphenols ( i.e. , chemical plant health benefit ) banana improve capacity counter oxidative stress , sugar lower post-exercise inflammation . The cyclist report gastrointestinal discomfort , however , high volume banana consume . Dole Foods , sponsor study , banana collection include many different variety , include Mini banana high sugar ( 50 % ) phenolic ( 63 % ) content typical banana ( Cavendish ) available store . Thus athletes experience similar performance benefit small volume Mini compare Cavendish banana , reduce gastrointestinal symptom . If study result favorable , Dole Foods may market Mini banana `` sport '' banana . The purpose study compare ingestion Mini Cavendish banana equicaloric , sugar-only beverage water 75-km cycling performance post-exercise oxidative capacity stress , inflammation , immune function , muscle damage soreness , gastrointestinal symptom .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The research procedures conduct Human Performance Laboratory ( Room 1201 , Plants Human Health Institute Building , 600 Laureate Way ) , operate Appalachian State University North Carolina Research Campus ( NCRC ) Kannapolis , NC . Participants come orientation/baseline test 4 exercise test session ( include two additional lab visit provide 1- 2-day 7:00 recovery blood sample ) ( thus 13 total lab visit ) . The total amount time participant ask volunteer study 35 hour Human Performance Laboratory ( 7 8-week period ) . ORIENTATION AND BASELINE TESTING : One two week prior first 75-km cycling time trial , participant report NCRC Human Performance Lab orientation/baseline test . Participants screen verify `` low risk '' status cardiovascular disease , provide voluntary consent . Demographic training history acquire questionnaire . Participants test VO2max ( i.e. , maximal oxygen consumption ) use Lodi cycle ergometer . The purpose VO2max test determine maximum exercise capacity . The time commitment 30 60 minute , participant wear exercise clothes shoe allow free movement vigorous exercise . Participants rest , well nourish , hydrate test avoid alcohol , caffeine , tobacco 3 hour test . Participants avoid significant exertion exercise day test report medication use test staff test . The test begin exercise warm-up period minute , participant pedal progressively hard workload . The test continue participant become fatigued decide stop , symptom prohibit exercise . Both leg tiredness breathlessness common sensation fatigue participant may experience . During test , participant wear facemask allows exhale air analyze , chest strap heart rate monitoring . Participants communicate lab personnel test use perceive exertion chart indicate exercise feel . Percent body fat measure use BodPod . Participants sit inside BodPod tight-fitting swim suit 10 minute body fat calculate . 75-km CYCLING TIME TRIALS : A . 3-day pre-75 km cycle preparation : During 3-day period prior 75-km cycling trial , participant taper exercise training ( prepare race ) ingest moderate-carbohydrate diet use food list restrict high fat food visible fat . Participants record food beverage intake 3-day period , nutrient intake assess use computerized dietary analysis software system . Participants bring food log exercise lab session . B . Testing procedure : Participants come lab four time 7:00 overnight fast state ( least 9 h food beverage water ) complete 75-cycling time trial ( least two week apart ) four separate condition ( random order , crossover ) : Water ( WAT ) ; Cavendish banana water ( BAN ) ; Mini banana water ( SPORT-BAN ) ; 6 % carbohydrate beverage ( SUGAR ) . 1 . 7:00 : A blood sample collect needle inserted arm vein ( 35 ml 2.5 tablespoon ) . An ultrasound scan thigh muscle conduct measure pre-exercise muscle glycogen level . The side thigh scan smooth probe attach General Electric LOGIQ-e ultrasound machine ( GE Healthcare , Milwaukee , WI ) . Participants lie back skin thigh expose . Three baseline scan obtain ( take 10 second ) , prior exercise test , muscle scan three time follow exercise bout . A simple questionnaire use indicate muscle soreness ( DOMS ) . Participants complete symptom log , include question digestive mental health ( heartburn , bloating , diarrhea , nausea , energy level , ability focus , etc. ) . Participants indicate response use 12-point Likert scale , 1 relate `` none '' , 6 `` moderate '' , 12 `` high '' . 2 . 7:10 : Ingest 5 ml/kg water alone ( 1.5 cup ) , SUGAR beverage , water ( 5 ml/kg ) BAN SPORT-BAN ( volume adjust provide 0.4 g carbohydrate per kilogram body weight ) ( two cup SUGAR beverage , one Cavendish banana , 1.5 Mini banana ) . 3 . 7:30 : Start 75-km cycling time trial . Participants complete 75-km course fast possible . - Participants use bicycle CompuTrainer Pro Model 8001 trainer ( RacerMate , Seattle , WA ) . - A mountainous 75-km course moderate difficulty utilized use CompuTrainer software system . - Heart rate rating perceive exertion ( RPE ) record every 30 minute , workload ( watt ) continuously monitor use CompuTrainer MultiRider software system ( version 3.0 , RacerMate , Seattle , WA ) . - Oxygen consumption , carbon dioxide production , ventilation measure use Cosmed metabolic cart 16 km 55 km cycling ( facemask similar occur baseline testing ) . Performance monitor throughout 75-km cycling time trial use percentage maximal watt ensure full effort give . - Participants consume 3 ml/kg water every 15 min ( e.g. , one cup 75 kg cyclist ) . - Participants ingest 0.2 g carbohydrate/kg body weight every 15 minute BAN , SPORT-BAN , SUGAR beverage 75-km time trial . For 75-kg cyclist , intake approximately 0.5 Cavendish banana , one Mini Banana , one cup SUGAR beverage every 15 minute . Bananas provide Dole Foods appropriate ripening stage ( equal stage six ) . The SUGAR beverage prepare Dole Foods , contain 60 gram sugar per liter use sugar profile find Cavendish banana . - No beverage food contain energy nutrient allow cycling time trial . 4 . ~10:00-11:30 : Immediate-post-exercise , 0.75-h , 1.5-h recovery blood sample ; lunch - Blood sample take arm vein immediately complete 75-km time trial , 0.75-h 1.5-h post-exercise . Participants allow shower change clothes facility . - An ultrasound scan muscle glycogen level conduct immediately post-exercise . - Immediately post-exercise , participant complete symptom log . - Participants indicate muscle soreness use DOMS questionnaire immediately post-exercise 1.5-h post-exercise . - Participants ingest food beverage water ( 7 ml/kg two cup 1.5 h post-exercise period ) . - Right 1.5-h recovery blood sample collect , participant ingest meal adjust 12 kcal/kg body weight . The meal prepared Dole Foods include grill chicken , rice , corn , green bean , salt , water . 5 . ~11:30 2:30 pm : 3-h 4.5-h recovery - Additional blood sample collect 3-h 4.5-h post-exercise . During time , participant rest quietly lab . - The DOMS questionnaire administer 4.5-h post-exercise . - Participants ingest food beverage water ( 7 ml/kg per hour ) . - At ~2:30 pm , participant allow leave lab , instruct adhere food list requirement , keep exercise training intensity moderate duration 1.5 h per day . 6 . 7:00 : 21-h 45-h Recovery sample ( follow two morning ) â€¢ Participants return lab follow two morning overnight fast state 7:00 ( ~21-h 45-h complete 75-km time trial ) . Blood sample responses DOMS questionnaire collect lab visit . Blood sample analyze marker muscle damage , inflammation oxidative stress indicator ( use blood level gene expression ) , immune function . Stored sample measure post-exercise shift hundred biochemicals use special method call metabolomics , pending additional sponsor funding .</detailed_description>
