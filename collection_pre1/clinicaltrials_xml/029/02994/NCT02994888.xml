	<brief_title>PROSPECT-C : A Study Biomarkers Response Resistance Anti-EGFR Therapies Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cetuximab panitumumab two monoclonal antibody routinely offer patient metastatic colorectal cancer mutation RAS gene . In Royal Marsden Hospital patient , refractory standard therapy metastatic colorectal cancer offer one agent third line metastatic setting . Whilst mechanisms response/resistance therapy well study , still incompletely understood . The main hypothesis study find mechanism response and/or resistance use novel technique next generation sequencing ( NGS ) and/or digital droplet polymerase chain reaction ( ddPCR ) therapies allow well patient selection application precision medicine patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. patient histologically confirm diagnosis metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma 2. wildtype RAS tumour status molecular analysis Royal Marsden Hospital 3. patient inoperable metastatic colorectal cancer schedule treat cetuximab ( panitumumab ) either monotherapy combination chemotherapy palliative intent 4. patient receive prior treatment oxaliplatin , irinotecan fluoropyrimidine contain chemotherapy regimen OR intolerance/contraindication either oxaliplatin irinotecan base chemotherapy , plan receive retreatment EGFR monoclonal antibody ( mAB ) monotherapy EGFR mAB combine chemotherapy ( irinotecan oxaliplatinbased ) patient already receive minimum 3 month previous line therapy . 5. patient metastatic disease sit amenable core biopsy ( preferably liver , soft tissue nodal disease , least one lesion 3cm diameter . If large lesion 23cm diameter , eligibility discuss radiologist prior study entry ) 6. patient age 18 year old 7. able provide fully informed consent , comply trial followup procedures 8. receive treatment Royal Marsden Hospital 1. patient previously receive treatment cetuximab panitumumab 2. previous malignancy colorectal cancer past 5 year , preinvasive malignancy cervix basal cell carcinoma , EXCEPT patient histological confirmation metastatic colorectal cancer site plan biopsied baseline progression disease 3. patient anticoagulated warfarin heparin 4 . Patients participate another clinical trial involve investigational medicinal product , unless 14 day cease investigational medicinal product 5 . Patients participate another research study involve tumour tissue biopsy plan take place time patient participate study</criteria>
