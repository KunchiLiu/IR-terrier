	<detailed_description>The objective research identify functional neural mechanism ( assess use fMRI ) short-term N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) administration among methadone-maintained individual cocaine dependence . Specifically , application proposes conduct randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , cross-over pilot study examine effect 7-day NAC administration ( 2400mg/day ) neural network engage response inhibition ( Go/No-Go task ) affective ( emotion-regulation task ) process among cocaine-dependent , methadone-maintained individual ( n=40 ; 20 per treatment-order condition ) .</detailed_description>
