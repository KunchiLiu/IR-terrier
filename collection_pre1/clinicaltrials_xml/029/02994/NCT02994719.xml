	<brief_title>Gait Analysis Neurological Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study aim determine whether gait pattern subject differ predictable quantifiable way age- sex-matched healthy control . This conduct ask 20 Parkinsonian disorder subject 20 age-matched healthy control subject walk 9 trial 18 ft walkway embedded pressure sensor baseline , self-selected slow faster speed . In addition , protocol aim investigate whether cluster gait pattern identify within subgroup individual parkinsonian disorder vary co-morbidities treatment condition . For aim additional 20 Parkinsonian disorder subject need recruit . There optional second visit protocol approximately 20 subject Parkinsonian disorder , willing come antiparkinson medication applicable , medication deep brain stimulation , ask walk additional 9 trial .</detailed_description>
