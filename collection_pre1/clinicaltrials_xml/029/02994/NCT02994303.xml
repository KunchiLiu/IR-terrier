	<brief_summary>In patient Fabry disease , research study explore presence podocytes urine potential non-invasive biomarker baseline kidney disease ; explore change quantity podocytes urine time predictor kidney disease progression . To accomplish , investigator evaluate quantification podocytes urine Fabry disease patient baseline longitudinally time . This study require single patient visit , patient provide urine specimen . The research team collect patient 's kidney function data proximate time urine collection , follow patient 's kidney function data longitudinally five year study review medical chart . The study offer intervention .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Podocyturia - Predictor Renal Dysfunction Fabry Nephropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite long-term recombinant enzyme replacement therapy , kidney failure remain common important complication Fabry disease . Recent study suggest early administration enzyme replacement therapy sufficient dosage may prevent progression kidney failure patient Fabry disease . Currently , reliable non-invasive biomarker detect early , occult kidney injury patient . Such early kidney injury detection critical guiding decision initiate enzyme replacement therapy , identify patient severe kidney injury may need high dos enzyme replacement therapy additional form therapy . Podocytes special kidney cell crucial role prevent escape protein blood urine . Biopsy study Fabry disease patient suggest podocyte injury occur early progressive increase age young Fabry disease patient . It also likely podocyte injury loss lead irreversible kidney lesion later stage Fabry disease nephropathy . Because injured podocytes slough urine ( manifestation know podocyturia ) , quantification urine podocytes might serve non-invasive sensitive biomarker useful predict Fabry disease nephropathy risk ; guide effective Fabry disease treatment . The investigator ' preliminary data show correlation presence urinary podocytes marker renal disease adult Fabry disease patient ; however , cross-sectional data need expand . The investigator information whether potential biomarker could predict progression disease . The investigator hypothesize since podocyte injury play central role kidney complication Fabry disease , podocyte loss detect urine identify patient great underlie kidney disease , identify patient great propensity kidney disease progression . They also hypothesize number podocytes urine patient Fabry disease correlate directly patient ' proteinuria , correlate inversely glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) baseline . Additionally investigator hypothesize number podocytes urine patient Fabry disease predict increase proteinuria decline glomerular filtration rate , measure long-term patient follow-up . Data collect include identification patient ' GLA gene mutation ; measurement baseline a-galactosidase A enzyme activity ; baseline age , gender , height weight ; measurement baseline serum creatinine ( SCr ) , eGFR , PCR ACR ; patient ' family history Fabry disease , history kidney systemic disease , medication include enzyme replacement therapy , medical information complication Fabry disease ( cardiomyopathy , arrhythmias , neuropathy gastrointestinal problem ) .</detailed_description>
