	<brief_title>Cisplatin + Radiation SCCHN Correlation With Oxidative Stress Markers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients first designate either : ) Cohort 1 ( locally advance non-nasopharyngeal SCCHN unresectable ) OR b ) Cohort 2 ( resect high risk recurrence least one follow criterion : extracapsular nodal extension , invasive cancer primary tumor resection margin ( positive margin ) , lymphovascular invasion perineural invasion , pT3 pT4 primary , presence multilevel nodal disease . Subjects randomized receive either Arm 1 Arm 2 cisplatin . Radiation Cisplatin give concurrently start day , ±1 day . Radiation continue without interruption whenever possible . Treatment consist standard care radiation therapy primary tumor head neck involve nodal metastasis drain nodal basin , determine treat radiation oncologist . Patients randomize receive cisplatin 100 mg/m2 every 3 week ( 3 dos ) radiation versus cisplatin 40 mg/m2 weekly ( 7 dos ) radiation . This provide similar cumulative dos cisplatin arm study.IMRT deliver 30-35 fraction 6-7 week , 5 fraction weekly . In absence treatment delay due adverse event ( ) , treatment continue 7 week one follow criterion applies : Disease progression , Intercurrent illness prevents administration treatment , Unacceptable adverse event ( ) , Patient decide withdraw study , General specific change patient 's condition render patient unacceptable treatment judgment investigator . Patients follow 2 year completion chemoradiation death , whichever occur first , toxicity PFS .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age ≥18 year . ECOG performance status 0 , 1 2 Life expectancy great 12 week . Patients must normal organ marrow function assess within 14 day prior registration define : absolute neutrophil count ≥1,000/mcL platelets ≥100,000/mcL creatinine within normal institutional limit OR creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 patient creatinine level institutional normal No prior chemotherapy current locally advanced SCCHN allow . Prior radiation chemotherapy previous head neck cancer allow provide full dose cisplatin radiation deliver patient clinical trial provide patient remission prior head neck cancer , undergo full dose radiation chemotherapy current primary head neck cancer . Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry , throughout duration active treatment 4 month completion chemotherapy radiation . Men treat enrol protocol must also agree use adequate contraception prior study , duration active study treatment , 4 month completion chemotherapy radiation ( induction definitive ) administration . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Patients receive investigational agent . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition cisplatin . Patients great grade 2 hearing loss . No prior malignancy allow except follow : head neck cancer remission , adequately treat basal cell squamous cell skin cancer , situ cervical cancer , adequately treat previous Stage I II cancer patient currently complete remission cancer patient diseasefree 2 year . Patients nasopharynx salivary gland primary site . Patients distant metastatic disease ( M1c ) current head neck cancer include brain metastasis . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection ( grade 3 great ) , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , symptomatic cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Subjects significant symptom congestive heart failure would expect tolerate IV hydration cisplatin exclude . Pregnant woman exclude study cisplatin radiation agent potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother cisplatin radiation , breastfeed discontinue mother treated cisplatin radiation trial . HIVpositive patient uncontrolled HIV despite combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Appropriate study undertake patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate</criteria>
