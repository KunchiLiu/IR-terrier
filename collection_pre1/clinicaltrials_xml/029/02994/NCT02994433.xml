	<brief_summary>Most clinical major depression respond standard treatment ( medication psychotherapy ) ; however , significant subset depress patient ( 15-20 % ) respond treatment refer treatment-resistant major depression ( TRMD ) . New treatment TRMD need , one promising line research drug know N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) glutamate receptor antagonist . In recent pilot study , group demonstrate NMDA antagonist nitrous oxide effective TRMD . This application propose take next important step understand nitrous oxide exerts effect human brain use state-of-the-art brain neuroimaging ( functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging ) group non-depressed , healthy volunteer compare result group TRMD patient . This study involve expose 20 non-depressed healthy participant 20 TRMD participant nitrous oxide placebo gas , compare brain image inhalation session . Sessions separate least one month prevent treatment effect carry follow session . All willing eligible subject undergo six functional connectivity MRI scan , two inhalation session . Functional image brain allow u trace interconnection various part brain , include involve emotion depression . Other procedure involve screen material ensure safety participant begin study ( i.e . MRI scan contraindication ) subject meet eligibility criterion target age range , depression/non-depressed state , neurological disorder history , medication exclusion .</brief_summary>
