	<brief_summary>This study explore potential circulate tumour DNA ( ctDNA ) predictive factor response/resistance anticancer treatment . The project involve collection study archive tumour tissue available ( mandatory ) , serial blood sample ( mandatory ) fresh tumour biopsy ( optional ) patient take part early phase clinical trial .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Some patient respond anti-cancer drug whilst others , despite tumour , apparently , similar characteristic site origin . This variability response case explain genetic profile tumour . Therefore , study relationship molecular profile individual cancer response therapy time crucial importance drug development . However , endeavour hamper difficulty access suitable tumour material analysis . Many patient ' tumour anatomical site make biopsy difficult / hazardous addition discomfort biopsy procedure . Therefore , study explore potential circulate tumour DNA predictive factor response/resistance anticancer treatment . For patient recruit early phase clinical trial experimental therapy , archival tumour tissue ( mandatory ) , serial blood sample ( mandatory ) fresh tumour biopsy ( optional ) collect accord individual schedule clinical trial . Blood plasma sample test cell-free ctDNA level genomic profile , may include analysis mutational profile , copy number variation , translocation , chromosomal rearrangement and/or epigenetic profile . Molecular profile archival fresh tumour biopsy also carry study correlation cell-free ctDNA sample investigate potential predictor response/resistance treatment .</detailed_description>
