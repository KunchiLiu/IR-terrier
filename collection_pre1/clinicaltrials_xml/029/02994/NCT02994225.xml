	<brief_summary>The initial standard treatment breast cancer surgery . Tumor involvement lymph node paramount importance subsequent management cancer surgery invasive breast cancer involve axillary lymph node dissection ( ALND ) . To preserve arm lymphatic drainage ALND avoid risk arm lymphedema , map lymphatic drainage axillary reverse mapping ( ARM ) develop . But oncological safety uncertain . The ARM procedure present us indocyanine green ( ICG ) fluorescence detection drain lymphatics . The project aim train surgeon technique identify predictive factor metastatic ARM node invasive BC use tumor axillary pathological parameter well select patient would require removal ARM node future</brief_summary>
