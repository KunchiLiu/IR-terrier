	<criteria>Subjects must sign write informed consent . Male female subject age great equal ( &gt; = ) 18 year . Subjects must histologically cytologically proven metastatic locally advanced solid tumor standard therapy exists , standard therapy fail , subject intolerant establish therapy know provide clinical benefit condition . Subjects treat previously checkpoint inhibitor may enroll . At least 1 unidimensional radiographically measurable lesion base Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) version 1.1 ( v1.1 ) , except subject metastatic castrationresistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) metastatic breast cancer may enrol objective evidence disease without measureable lesion . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 1 Screening Estimated life expectancy 12 week Adequate hematological function define : White blood cell ( WBC ) count &gt; = 3.0 × 10^9 per liter ( /L ) Absolute neutrophil count &gt; = 1.5 × 10^9/L Lymphocyte count &gt; = 0.5 × 10^9/L Platelet count &gt; = 100 × 10^9/L Hemoglobin &gt; = 9 gram per deciliter ( g/dL ) ( may transfuse ) Adequate hepatic function define : A total bilirubin level &lt; = 1.5 × upper limit normal ( ULN ) range Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) level &lt; = 2.5 × ULN Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) level &lt; = 2.5 × ULN Subjects document Gilbert disease allow total bilirubin &gt; 1.5 less 3 × ULN Adequate renal function define estimate creatinine clearance &gt; = 50 milliliter per minute ( mL/min ) accord CockcroftGault formula Negative blood pregnancy test Screening woman childbearing potential . For purpose trial , woman childbearing potential define female subject puberty unless postmenopausal least 1 year , surgically sterile sexually inactive . Highly effective contraception ( ie , method failure rate le 1 % per year ) must use start treatment , duration trial treatment , least 60 day stop trial participation men woman risk conception exists . The effect avelumab NHSIL12 develop human fetus unknown ; thus , woman childbearing potential men must agree use effective contraception . Concurrent treatment nonpermitted drug/intervention ( list ) Anticancer treatment ( eg , cytoreductive therapy , radiotherapy , immune therapy , cytokine therapy , monoclonal antibody , target small molecule therapy ) investigational drug within 2 week prior start trial treatment , recover adverse event ( AE ) relate therapy , follow exception : Palliative bonedirected radiotherapy permit ; Erythropoietin darbepoetinα permit ; Hormonal therapy act hypothalamicpituitarygonadal axis permit ( i.e . luteinizing hormonereleasing hormone agonist/antagonists ) . No hormonal anticancer therapy permit . Major surgery ( deem Investigator ) reason , except diagnostic biopsy , within 4 week prior start trial treatment , fully recover surgery within 4 week prior start trial treatment Subjects receive immunosuppressive agent ( steroid ) reason taper drug start trial treatment , follow exception : Subjects adrenal insufficiency , may continue corticosteroid physiologic replacement dose , equivalent le ( &lt; ) 10 mg prednisone daily ; Administration steroids route know result minimal systemic exposure ( topical , intranasal , introocular , inhalation ) permit ; Previous ongoing administration systemic steroid management acute allergic phenomenon acceptable long anticipated administration steroid complete 14 day , dose 14 day equivalent &lt; = 10 mg prednisone daily . Any prior treatment form interlukin12 ( IL12 ) Intolerance checkpoint inhibitor therapy , define occurrence AE require drug discontinuation . Active history primary metastatic central nervous system tumor Prior organ transplantation , include allogeneic stemcell transplantation Previous malignant disease ( indication trial ) within last 5 year ( except adequately treat nonmelanoma skin cancer , carcinoma situ skin , bladder , cervix , colon/rectum , breast , prostate ) unless complete remission without recurrence achieve least 2 year prior trial entry subject deem cured additional therapy require anticipate require . Significant acute chronic infection require systemic therapy include , among others : History test positive test human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) know acquired immunodeficiency syndrome Hepatitis B C infection ( HBV surface antigen positive HBV core antibody positive reflex positive HBV deoxy ribonucleic acid ( DNA ) HBV core antibody positive alone reflex positive HBV DNA positive hepatitis C virus [ HCV ] antibody reflex positive HCV ribonucleic acid [ RNA ] ) . Subjects history infection must polymerase chain reaction documentation infection clear . Active tuberculosis ( history exposure history positive TB ( tuberculosis ) test presence clinical symptom , physical , radiographic find Active history autoimmune disease might deteriorate receive immunostimulatory agent . Subjects diabetes type I , vitiligo , psoriasis , hypo hyperthyroid disease require immunosuppressive treatment eligible . Known severe hypersensitivity reaction monoclonal antibody ( Grade &gt; = 3 National Cancer InstituteCommon Terminology Criteria Adverse Event ( NCICTCAE ) v4.03 , uncontrolled asthma ( ie , 3 feature partially control asthma ) History allergic reaction methotrexate ( trace methotrexate may present NHSIL12 part manufacture process ) Persisting toxicity relate prior therapy Grade &gt; 1 NCICTCAE v4.03 follow exception : Neuropathy Grade &lt; = 2 acceptable . All grade alopecia acceptable . Endocrine dysfunction replacement therapy acceptable . Pregnancy lactation Known alcohol drug abuse deem Investigator Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited : Hypertension uncontrolled standard therapy ( stabilize 150/90 millimeter mercury ( mm Hg ) low ) Uncontrolled active infection Uncontrolled diabetes ( eg , glycosylated hemoglobin [ HgbA1c ] &gt; = 8 % ) Clinically significant ( active ) cardiovascular disease : cerebral vascular accident/stroke ( &lt; 6 month prior enrollment ) , myocardial infarction ( &lt; 6 month prior enrollment ) , unstable angina , congestive heart failure ( New York Heart Association Classification Class &gt; = II ) , serious cardiac arrhythmia require medication All significant disease ( eg , inflammatory bowel disease , current severe acute chronic colitis ) chronic medical condition ( include laboratory abnormality ) opinion Investigator might impair subject 's tolerance trial treatment interpretation trial result . Any psychiatric condition would prohibit understanding rendering informed consent would limit compliance trial requirement Legal incapacity limit legal capacity Administration live vaccine within 30 day prior trial entry Any subject possible area ongoing necrosis ( nondisease relate ) , active ulcer , nonhealing wound , intercurrent bone fracture may risk delayed heal due protocol therapy Oxygen saturation &lt; 90 % rest , know pulmonary fibrosis , active interstitial lung disease History congenital active immunodeficiency , exception acquire treatmentrelated hypogammaglobulinemia require periodic IV immunoglobulin infusion .</criteria>
