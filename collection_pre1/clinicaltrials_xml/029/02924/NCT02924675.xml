	<brief_summary>Referred otalgia one symptom oropharynx hypopharynx cancer . It primary ( otodynia ) secondary ( referred otalgia project pain ) . The mechanism refer otalgia involves several non adjacent nerve territory head , neck ear . Referred otalgia project pain due injury ( time cancer ) localize far ear share innervation . In contest , otoscopy normal . Four cranial nerve participate sensory innervation external ear : trigeminal nerve ( V ) via auriculo temporal nerve ( V3 ) , facial nerve ( VII ) Ramsay-Hunt 's zone conch , tragus , antitragus , part anthelix , external auditory meatus eardrum , glossopharyngeal nerve ( IX ) via Jacobson 's nerve external ear canal C2 C3 cervical plexus . However , important interindividual anatomical variation . The relationship refer otalgia probable nerve damage describe . In oropharynx hypopharynx , proximity sensory innervation ear explain otalgia cancer progression . Then refer otalgia neuropathic component . In literature , curative treatment refer otalgia cancer treatment . However , high intensity refer otalgia lead patient large consumption analgesic particular opioids . These latter particularly adapt pain result excess nociceptive stimulation . Pregabalin ( LyricaÂ® ) analogue gamma aminobutyric acid . This molecule bind alpha subunit 2 delta 1 calcium dependent voltage channel central nervous system . effectiveness demonstrate treatment neuropathic pain diabetic neuropathy , post herpetic neuralgia , lesion bone marrow also postoperative pain molecule administer surgery . The anti hyperalgesic activity pregabalin dosage 150mg/day two three daily dos . The purpose study evaluate activity pregabalin administer orally three week anesthesia consultation intensity pain refer otalgia neuropathic component .</brief_summary>
