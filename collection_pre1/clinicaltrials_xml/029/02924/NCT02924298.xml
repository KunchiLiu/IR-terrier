	<brief_summary>In past two decade , prevalence obesity US increase 23.2 % 32.9 % . This epidemic fueling Chronic Kidney Disease ( CKD ) epidemic . This likely major challenge face nephrology community next decade beyond . This pilot study design test feasibility Sit Less , Interact , Move More ( SLIMM ) intervention determine preliminary impact light physical activity ( PA ) level . Increasing light PA may significant impact obesity slow progression CDK .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>More one-third U.S. adult ( 35.7 % ) obese ( body mass index ( BMI ) &gt; 30 kg/m2 ) . In 2008 , medical cost associate obesity estimate $ 147 billion . Furthermore , grade association BMI risk end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) . Indeed , increase prevalence CKD US population partly explain increase BMI . Hence , public health policy , imperative obesity target order decrease morbidity , mortality healthcare cost burden associate CKD ESRD . Physical inactivity play major role obesity . Volitional exercise ( VE ) , include moderate vigorous physical activity ( MVPA ) sport fitness-related activity , non-volitional exercise , include low light intensity physical activity ( PA ) activity daily live , fidget , spontaneous muscle contraction , maintain posture non-recumbent position , represent two different end PA spectrum . The current national recommendation focus MVPA ( 30 minute moderate PA five time week 25 minute vigorous activity three time week ) . However , relative importance low light activity MVPA establish . As described preliminary data , analysis objectively measure PA National Health And Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) suggest large amount light intensity PA strongly associate low odds proteinuria , low odds CKD low hazard death give level MVPA . Furthermore , appear threshold effect MVPA mortality plateau half currently recommend level MVPA . Since physical function CKD population low , 30 minute moderate PA five time week 25 minute vigorous activity three time week might induce fatigue paradoxically reduce light intensity PA. On hand , low target MVPA might improve adherence MVPA well decrease light PA . This pilot intervention study test efficacy , feasibility tolerability SLIMM intervention . The result intervention later use determine target obesity via SLIMM intervention slow kidney disease progression . DESIGN : This pilot intervention study examine feasibility adherence SLIMM intervention increase level light physical activity Baseline visit : Baseline PA data collect accelerometer week follow screen visit . Participants instruct importance physical activity , recommendation 150 min/wk moderate PA , 75 min/wk vigorous PA , provide example physical activity . SLIMM Intervention : The goal SLIMM intervention increase time spent light activity ( Light physical activity define 500-2019 counts/minute ) . This intervention complete individual CKD non-CKD group . At week 6 intervention participant instruct perform 5 minute light activity 25 minute sit time . At week 12 , participant instruct increase light activity goal 10 minute 20 minute sit time . Thus , goal replace total sedentary time increase light activity 15 % 6 week 33 % end intervention . All participant undergo standardized training SLIMM intervention train study personnel 6 week visit . Participants initially ask perform 5 minute light activity every 25 minute spend seat . At week 12 visit , participant ask increase activity , perform 10 minute light activity every 20 minute spend seat . Training provide one one session reinforce follow visit . Accelerometry data paper PA diary data collect week baseline visit review participant provide feedback use devise customized plan increase light activity . Examples increase light activity within natural , free-living environment provide . For instance , majority day spend work desk , encourage stand and/or walk 5 minute every 25 minute spend sedentary week 6-12 , 10 minute light activity every 20 minute spend sedentary week 12-18 . Participants ask stand and/or walk commercial break watch television .</detailed_description>
