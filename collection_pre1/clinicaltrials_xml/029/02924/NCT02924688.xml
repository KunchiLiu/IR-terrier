Current Asthma Maintenance Therapy : Subjects eligible require daily ICS/LABA least 12 week prior Visit 0 change maintenance asthma medication 6 week immediately prior Visit 0 ( include change stable total dose ICS &gt; 250 mcg/day fluticasone proprionate [ FP , equivalent ] ) . Spirometry : A best prebronchodilator morning ( ante meridian [ AM ] ) FEV1 &gt; =30 % &lt; 80 % predict normal value Visit 1 .

Asthma medication : Changes asthma medication ( exclude runin medication albuterol/salbutamol inhalation aerosol provide Visit 1 ) . Laboratory test abnormality : Evidence clinically significant abnormal laboratory test screen runin still abnormal upon repeat analysis believe due disease ( ) present . Each Investigator use his/her discretion determine clinical significance abnormality .
