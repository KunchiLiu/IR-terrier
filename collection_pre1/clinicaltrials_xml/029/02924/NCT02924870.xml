	<detailed_description>Objectives : To compare level physical activity ( PAL ) 12 month patient moderate-very severe COPD complete health education program . Secondary objective : 1 ) To compare average step per day 12 month patient moderate-very severe COPD intervention group ( conventional treatment plus health education program ) control group ( conventional treatment ) ; 2 ) compare daily minute moderate high intensity 12 month intervention control group ; 3 ) compare daily energy expenditure high 3 metabolic equivalent ( METs ) 12 month intervention control group ; 4 ) compare distribution profile daily physical activity ( sedentary , sedentary , moderately active ) 12 month intervention control group ; 5 ) evaluate long-term effect health education program health-related quality life patient moderate severe COPD ; 6 ) analyze effect health education program risk power rate moderate severe COPD exacerbation ; 7 ) ass relationship change PAL modification health-related quality life number moderate severe exacerbation ; 8 ) identify determinant clinically relevant increase PAL ( &gt; 0.14 unit ) patient moderate severe COPD . METHODS I . Study subject . Patient selection hold consecutively Department Pneumology , University Hospital La Paz-Cantoblanco-Carlos III , accord follow criterion . - Inclusion criterion : subject older 35 year ; diagnosis moderate severe COPD ( FEV1 &lt; 80 % predict ) , accord GesEPOC criterion [ Arch Bronconeumol 2012 ; 48 ( Suppl 1 ) :2-58 ] , establish least 3 month ; current former smoker accumulate consumption &gt; 10 pack x year ; hospital admission COPD exacerbation . - Exclusion criterion : osteoarticular , neuromuscular cognitive limitation prevents ambulation ; previous diagnosis active neoplastic disease ; institutionalized patient ; alcohol consumption &gt; 60 g/day ; patient belong another health sector Community Madrid community ; participation another study within 6 month prior . All participant must sign informed consent approve Ethics Committee University Hospital La Paz . II . Design . Randomized , parallel open-label clinical trial , control conventional treatment . A. Protocol intervention . During hospitalization , select patient receive conventional treatment . At discharge , randomize ( 1:1 ) : - Control group . Treatment follow-up accord conventional clinical practice ( GesEPOC guideline ) , include recommendation healthy habit lifestyle . - Intervention group . In addition conventional treatment follow-up , patient refer nursing consultation perform two health education session , 15 30 day hospital discharge . The first session last 90 minute consist four stage : - Basic formation . The manual `` Controlling COPD '' , publish Spanish Society Pneumology Thoracic Surgery ( SEPAR ) hand participant . The nurse individually review follow aspect : basic lung anatomy physiology , COPD concept , importance tobacco , diagnostic test COPD ( spirometry , blood gas , sputum culture , simple radiology , laboratory , walk test ) , COPD treat . - Care COPD : diet , breathe exercise , physical exercise ( walk , cycle , treadmill ... ) , lifestyle ( clothing , hygiene , preen , exercise , rest , sexuality , social relation ) . - Management conventional treatment : inhaler , oxygen therapy medication ; integration treatment , adhesion ; smoke cessation . - Action Plan : patient nurse establish target activity patient must perform well frequency duration , accord WHO guideline . The second session last approximately 15 minute schedule month later . Current situation patient change previous session assess ; compliance physical activity plan deviation cause analyze ; weakness patient strengthen ( training , incentive ) ; skills management inhaler , oxygen , breathe exercise test ; new physical activity plan maintain intensified ( WHO guideline ) . There therapeutic restriction patient include study , treat usual pulmonologist health professional accord clinical judgment . Therefore , limitation pose change usual treatment ( include prescription oxygen therapy noninvasive ventilation ) schedule follow-up visit perform regular doctor . B . Sample size . Considering mean PAL value 1.55 ± 0.265 patient moderate-severe COPD increase 0.14 unit clinically relevant , since associate mortality reduction [ Chest 2011 ; 140:331-42 ] , detect difference ≥0.14 unit , contrast bilateral hypothesis ( alpha risk=0.05 , beta risk=0.20 drop-out rate=10 % ) , estimate necessary randomize 64 patient treatment arm . III . Measurements . At 15 day 12 month discharge , follow determination make : 1 . Anthropometric characteristic ( sex , age , weight , height , BMI BSA ) . 2 . Clinical evaluation : Smoking history ( cigarettes/day , packs-year ) , date COPD diagnosis , comorbidities , current medication ; visit primary care physician pulmonologist ( schedule unscheduled ) emergency room ( date cause ) , hospitalization ( date cause ) period work ( date cause ) ; number date moderate ( prescription antibiotic systemic corticosteroid ) severe ( hospitalization stay emergency department &gt; 24 hour ) exacerbation . 3 . Questionnaires : mMRC dyspnea scale , Charlson COTE comorbidity index , CAT LCADL . 4 . Spirometry six-minutes walk test , accord current guideline [ Arch Bronconeumol 2013 ; 49 : 388-401 ; Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2002 ; 166 : 111-7 ] . 5 . Evaluation daily physical activity . It make use Sense Wear accelerometer ( Body Media ) , place dominant arm 7 consecutive day . The physical activity level ( PAL ) record . Depending parameter , subject classify sedentary ( PAL &lt; 1.40 ) , sedentary ( PAL 1.40 1.69 ) moderately active ( PAL &gt; 1.70 ) . The mean step per day , minute per day moderate high intensity ( &gt; 3 METs ) daily energy expenditure &gt; 3 METs also determine . IV . Statistical analysis . T-Student , Mann-Whitney chi-square test between-groups comparison . Relationship analysis use Pearson correlation multivariate regression model . Intention-to-treat evaluation main objective imputation miss data regression model . The effect intervention evaluate difference change variable two group use general linear model . The crude effect ( adjust baseline value ) adjust effect several confounders ( sex , age , BMI , smoking , treatment FEV1 % ) determine .</detailed_description>
