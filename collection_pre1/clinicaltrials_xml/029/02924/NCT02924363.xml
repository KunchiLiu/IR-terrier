	<brief_summary>The purpose study use cardiac magnetic resonance ( CMR ) echocardiography define anatomic functional remodel result MitraClip implantation . A total sixty ( 60 ) patient undergo MitraClip implantation enrol across multiple site . The severity mitral regurgitation , cardiac morphology function assess patient BASELINE ( within 30 day prior MitraClip implantation ) , ACUTE REMODELING PHASE ( pre-discharge follow implantation ) , CHRONIC REMODELING PHASE ( 6 month post-implantation ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect MitraClip Acute Chronic Reverse Cardiac Remodeling Assessed CMR : The MITRA-REVERSE Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Percutaneous mitral valve repair expand treatment option patient suffer symptomatic mitral regurgitation ( MR ) . The overall objective procedure reduce degree MR , may lead improvement : 1 ) hemodynamics , increase systemic stroke volume decrease leave atrial ( LA ) pressure ; 2 ) leave ventricular ( LV ) LA volume ( reverse remodel ) ; 3 ) efficiency LV mechanic ( decrease wall stress improve fluid kinetics LV ) . The MitraClip System percutaneous therapy available high surgical risk patient significant MR ( Figure 1 ) . Two-dimensional Echocardiography ( 2-D ) data Endovascular valve edge-to-edge study ( EVEREST trial ) show reverse modeling LA LV volumes patient primary MR MitraClip implantation . In separate study , patient secondary MR non-respondent cardiac resynchronization therapy ( CRT ) demonstrate improvement LA LV volumes post-MitraClip implantation [ 3 ] . Two small study also demonstrate feasibility use CMR show improvement LA LV volumes post-MitraClip . Immediate post-procedural reduction MR , conversely degree residual MR , show predictive factor long-term improvement MR , LV LA reverse remodeling , survival . Current assessment MR reduction post-MitraClip relies combination indirect hemodynamic parameter , LA pressure 2-D Echo parameter , semi-quantitative best . Therefore , rapid accurate quantitative method ass degree residual MR great need complement invasive indirect/qualitative echo parameter . This improve reliability reproducibility residual MR assessment post-Mitraclip , also provide objective index define successful procedural outcome . The latter may potentially help decision make placement additional clip reduce MR. Of quantitative color Doppler parameter use measure degree MR , regurgitant volume/fraction ( RV/RF ) probably optimal index . The Mitra-clip show distort data flow convergence ( PISA ) method , result complicate unreliable assessment MR . Similarly , vena contracta ( VC ) also distort Mitra-Clip , lead unreliable unreproducible measure MR . It previously show real-time volume color flow Doppler ( RT-VCFD ) trans-thoracic echocardiography ( TTE ) useful quantify RV/RF comparable CMR . Since 3-D transesophageal echocardiography commonly use Mitra-Clip assessment , principle apply RT-VCFD TEE . The preliminary experience approach show promise . The attenuation LV/LA remodeling , define reduction LV end-systolic volume LA volume , important goal MR reduction Mitra-clip placement . Post Mitra-Clip TTE limit acoustic window least one-third patient , render 3-D TTE measurement LV/LA volume unfeasible . Contrast Echo mitigate drawback TTE , 2-D volume under-estimated compare CMR . Hence , impact MR reduction Mitra-clip LV/LA remodel best determine CMR . Furthermore , CMR provide independent reference standard validate RV/RF measure RT-VCFD TEE pre- post-Mitra-clip placement . Cardiac morphology function primarily assess echocardiography patient undergo percutaneous mitral valve repair , know limitation regard image quality reproducibility . Transesophageal echocardiogram ( TEE ) standard technique assess MR intra-procedural guidance ; however , TEE quantification MR effective orifice area MitraClip placement challenge double-orifice valve model well validate . While reduction chamber size MitraClip placement demonstrate , prior analysis limit imprecise assessment regurgitation severity result successful remodel clinical improvement . Alternatively , CMR validate noninvasive technique could utilize evaluate heart valve structure , function , myocardial fibrosis without geometric assumption harmful radiation . CMR enable noninvasive evaluation cardiac anatomy , include great artery vein , cardiac chamber . It provide excellent evaluation leave ventricle ( LV ) right ventricle ( RV ) , include ventricular size , thickness , wall motion , volume , ejection fraction ( EF ) , without need geometric assumption . Many consider CMR gold standard quantify ventricular volume EF . In addition , CMR good define valvular disease due ability precisely quantify regurgitant volume fraction without limitation acoustic window , highly eccentric/multiple jet . Feasibility safety CMR MitraClip placement previously show [ 5 ] . In order obtain concurrent comparison CMR echocardiography , comprehensive 2D/3D echo Doppler perform immediately CMR scan . The echocardiography protocol outline detail Echo Imaging Manual . Additionally , SUBSTUDY ( MITRA-REVERSE FIBROSIS ) explore new CMR technique , T1 map extracellular volume fraction quantification , non-invasively quantify extent diffuse extracellular matrix expansion surrogate interstitial fibrosis , support histological validation . The interplay diffuse interstitial fibrosis , volume overload reduction ( via decrease mitral regurgitation ) , subsequent LV reverse remodel well understood . It possible increase burden diffuse interstitial fibrosis baseline may prevent , blunt , delay reverse remodel occurs follow volume overload reduction . Alternatively , volume overload reduction reverse LV remodeling may lead subsequent reduction diffuse interstitial fibrosis A sub-study gadolinium contrast administration attempt address question . MR patient without contraindication gadolinium enrol sub-study include pre- post-gadolinium contrast image order quantify LV myocardial replacement interstitial fibrosis , well papillary muscle fibrosis . Recently , cohort 48 patient chronic MR undergo surgical mitral valve repair , demonstrate presence LV myocardial fibrosis assess delayed-enhancement CMR independent predictor increase adverse clinical outcome . Similarly , sub-study intend examine correlation presence extent myocardial replacement interstitial fibrosis clinical response , assess NYHA ( New York Heart Association ) class Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire , follow MitraClip procedure . Moreover , new technique quantify replacement fibrosis papillary muscle may exploit gadolinium sub-study could provide additional information , papillary muscle leave ventricle key component mitral valve apparatus . Papillary muscle connect LV wall mitral leaflet annulus , regulate location mitral leaflet . Thus , geometry function papillary muscle contribute mitral valve function accurate evaluation key understand pathophysiology mitral valve disease . This evaluation papillary muscle rely new procedure base use novel dark blood delay enhancement imaging technique .</detailed_description>
