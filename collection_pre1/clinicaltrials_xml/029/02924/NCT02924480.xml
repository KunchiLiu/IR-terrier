	<detailed_description>Design The design randomize , double blind , single institute prospective study patient undergo Open Robotic Assisted cystectomy procedure Charleston Area Medical Center Charleston , West Virginia . All patient follow informed consent meet inclusion criterion eligible participate study . Procedures Protocol This study two group . Each group follow standardize post cystectomy protocol reduce confound factor regard postoperative management . Study Group Group A : The lidocaine infusion group receive lidocaine bolus 30 minute prior skin incision infusion continue 60 minute skin closure . Control Group Group B : Patients randomize control group receive normal saline bolus infusion procedure study arm . All patient group pain score document time surgery . A baseline level abdominal pain assess use 0 10 verbal analog scale ( VAS ) , rating `` 0 '' indicate `` pain '' score `` 10 '' indicate `` bad pain imaginable '' . This data , baseline preoperative pain score , use statistician data analysis . After surgery , nursing staff record exact time patient pass first flatus first bowel movement ; nurse also routinely ask patient bowel activity patient assessment . Postoperative nausea and/or vomit assess similar fashion nursing staff . From Postoperative Day 1 discharge ( 108 hour ) , specified time interval patient ask score average pain scale O-10 ( 0 = none ; 10 = worst pain imaginable ) nausea/vomiting experience . The numeric rating scale use study use commonly patient post-operatively due common use pain assessment study . This information along medication use time interval record nursing staff Charleston Area Medical Center . The American Pain Society Patient Outcome Questionnaire ( APS-POQ-R ) use ass pain management first 24 hour surgery .

This validated multiple study assess pain patient use reference literature regard pain management previously publish . In order compare arm primary outcome , namely improve pain control , decrease opioid consumption , improve resolution ileus , descriptive analysis perform mean , standard deviation , range percentage report prospective variable . In addition subgroup analysis conduct use statistical test study control group examine difference medication use , pain relief satisfaction , post procedure pain score . Continuous variable analyze use Student 's t-test categorical variable use chi-square Fisher 's Exact Test . Logistic regression use need determine variable associate study group . A p &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant .</detailed_description>
