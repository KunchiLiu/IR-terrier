	<brief_summary>This pilot , randomize , two arm neoadjuvant vaccine study human leukocyte antigen-A2 positive ( HLA-A2+ ) adults World Health Organization ( WHO ) grade II glioma , surgical resection tumor clinically indicate . Co-primary objective determine : 1 ) safety novel combination subcutaneously administer IMA950 peptide poly-ICLC ( Hiltonol ) i.v . administer CDX-1127 ( Varlilumab ) neoadjuvant approach ; 2 ) whether addition i.v . CDX-1127 ( Varlilumab ) increase response rate magnitude CD4+ CD8+ T-cell response IMA950 peptides post-vaccine peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) sample obtain participate patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Low-grade glioma ( LGG ) , common pilocytic astrocytomas , diffuse astrocytomas , oligodendrogliomas diverse family central nervous system ( CNS ) neoplasm occur child adult . Based data American Cancer Society Central Brain Tumor Registry United States ( CBRTUS ) , approximately 1,800 LGG diagnose 2006 , thus represent approximately 10 % newly diagnose primary brain tumor United States . Pilocytic astrocytomas ( WHO grade I ) common brain tumor child 5 19 year age . Diffuse astrocytomas oligodendrogliomas consider WHO grade II low grade glioma ( LGG ) common adult . Pilocytic astrocytomas generally well circumscribe histologically radiographically amenable cure gross total resection . In contrast , diffuse astrocytomas oligodendrogliomas infiltrative less amenable complete resection . From molecular genetics standpoint , common alteration LGG IDH1 mutation mutation tumor suppressor gene TP53 , locate chromosome 17 , gene product multifunctional protein involve regulation cell growth , cell death ( apoptosis ) , transcription . Additionally , several molecular factor favorable prognostic significance , particularly presence 1p/19q co-deletion isocitrate dehydrogenase ( IDH ) mutation . WHO grade II LGGs risk undergo malignant transformation aggressive lethal WHO grade III IV high-grade glioma ( HGG ) . Even combination available therapeutic modality ( i.e. , surgery , radiation therapy [ RT ] , chemotherapy ) , invasive growth resistance therapy exhibit tumor result recurrence death patient . Although postoperative RT LGG significantly improve 5-year progression-free survival ( PFS ) , prolong overall survival ( OS ) compare delayed RT give time progression . Early result randomize trial radiation therapy plus procarbazine , lomustine , vincristine ( PCV ) chemotherapy supratentorial adult LGG ( RTOG 9802 ) demonstrate improved PFS patient receive PCV plus RT compare RT alone . Nonetheless , PCV considerably toxic currently widely use management glioma patient . Although chemotherapy temozolomide ( TMZ ) currently investigate LGG patient , unknown whether confers improve OS patient . Further , recent study indicate 6 10 LGG case treat TMZ progress HGG markedly increase exome mutation , worrisome , driver mutation RB AKT-mTOR pathway , predominant C &gt; T/G &gt; A transition CpC CpT dinucleotides , strongly suggest signature TMZ-induced mutagenesis ; study also show 43 % case , least half mutation initial tumor undetected recurrence , IDH mutation type mutation persist initial recurrent tumor . These data suggest possibility treatment LGG patient TMZ may enhance oncogenic mutation genetic elusiveness LGG , therefore call development safer effective therapeutic modality vaccine . Taken together , LGG consider premalignant condition HGG , novel intervention prevent malignant transformation need evaluate patient LGG . Immunotherapeutic modality , vaccine , may offer safe effective option patient due slow growth rate LGG ( contrast HGG ) , allow sufficient time multiple immunization hence high level anti-glioma immunity . Because patient LGGs generally immuno-compromised patient HGG , may also exhibit great immunological response benefit vaccine . Further , generally mild toxicity vaccine may improve quality life compare chemotherapy RT .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must ≥ 18 year old . Pathological criterion Participants must WHO grade II astrocytoma , oligoastrocytoma oligodendroglioma histologically confirm prior biopsy surgical resection . If patient already undergone biopsy pathological diagnosis nonUCSF institute , pathology must review confirmed UCSF . Patients must positive HLAA2 base flowcytometry genotyping Before enrollment , patient must show nonenhancing T2FLAIR lesion need surgically resect likely WHO grade II glioma . Surgical resection least 0.5 gram tumor Both newly diagnose ( available pathological diagnosis ) recurrent patient eligible . Prior radiation therapy ( RT ) initial diagnosis allow must least 6 month completion RT ( radiosurgery ) sign informed consent . Prior chemotherapy systemic molecularly target antitumor therapy allow . Patients must Karnofsky performance status ( KPS ) ≥ 70 % . Off low dose ( ≤ 4 mg/day Decadron ) corticosteroid least two week first presurgical vaccine Adequate organ function within 14 day study registration include : 1 ) Adequate bone marrow reserve : absolute neutrophil ( segmented band ) count ( ANC ) ≥1.0 x 10^9/L , absolute lymphocyte ≥400/μL , platelet ≥100 x 10^9/L ; hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL ; 2 ) Hepatic : Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) SGPT ( ALT ) ≤ 2.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) , 3 ) Renal : Normal serum creatinine creatinine clearance ≥60 ml/min/1.73 m^2 Must free systemic infection . Subjects active infection ( whether require antibiotic therapy ) may eligible complete resolution infection . Subjects antibiotic therapy must antibiotics least 7 day begin treatment . Sexually active female child bear potential must agree use adequate contraception ( diaphragm , birth control pill , injection , intrauterine device [ IUD ] , surgical sterilization , subcutaneous implant , abstinence , etc . ) duration vaccination period . Sexually active male must agree use barrier contraceptive duration vaccination period . Patient must sign informed consent document indicate aware investigational nature study , include authorization release protect health information Presence gliomatosis cerebri , cranial spinal leptomeningeal metastatic disease Presence T1 Gadolinium ( Gd ) enhance lesion ( MRI ) suggestive highgrade glioma Pathological diagnosis resect tumor demonstrate transformation high grade ( i.e . WHO grade III IV ) glioma . If patient receive presurgical vaccine diagnose highgrade glioma ( HGG ) , patient withdrawn study consider therapeutic option HGG ( trial HGG standard care ) . The tumor tissue case would bring lab pathological diagnosis make ; thus would process lab inform final HGG diagnosis . Because HGG tissue may still reflect vaccine effect , evaluate tumor tissue help u develop future approach HGG . Pregnant woman exclude study . Pregnancy test perform menstruate female within 14 day prior study enrollment Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited ongoing active infection ( e.g . active chronic hepatitis B C ) , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement History current status immune system abnormalities hyperimmunity ( e.g. , autoimmune disease ) need treated systemic therapy , immunosuppressant hypoimmunity ( e.g. , myelodysplastic disorder , marrow failure , AIDS , transplant immunosuppression ) . Receiving ongoing treatment immunosuppressive drug , dexamethasone &gt; 4mg</criteria>
