	<brief_title>Histidine Therapy : A Project Treat HARS Deficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HARS syndrome progressive degenerative disease affect eyesight hearing cause mutation HARS gene code enzyme involve protein synthesis . HARS syndrome exclusively find Old Order Amish community Southwestern Ontario Pennsylvania . Children disorder initially normal vision hearing , febrile illness , sudden loss vision hearing , well visual hallucination . There evidence vision loss progress , albeit slow rate , even without febrile incident . In severe case , fluid accumulates lung ( acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS ) cause drop oxygen level sometimes death . There currently specific treatment HARS syndrome , apart supportive care . Anecdotal evidence adult HARS syndrome treat amino acid L-histidine suggests improvement vision , however baseline objective measurement vision prior use histidine . We design pilot project histidine give child HARS 6 month . Investigators hypothesize histidine well tolerate easily administer , without side effect . Investigators monitor vision , hear bloodwork determine change course treatment . As well , investigator plan administer increased dos histidine acute illness , hop prevent deterioration breathe due ARDS . The result initial pilot project may pave way long term study use histidine .</detailed_description>
