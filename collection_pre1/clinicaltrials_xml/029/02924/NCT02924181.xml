	<brief_summary>Pulmonary vein ( PV ) isolation important atrial fibrillation ( AF ) catheter ablation . PV reconnection one main reason AF recurrence . Contact force-sensing catheter new catheter valuable tool monitor increase efficacy PV isolation . Previous paper report efficacy contact force-sensing catheter immediate PV isolation outcome . However , might confound factor inter-individual variation . Therefore , would like compare efficacy contact force-sensing catheter within patient different vein . In study , would like confirm efficacy contact force-sensing catheter immediate PV isolation outcome within patient . This study randomize right left PVs whether use contact force-sensing function . The study design minimize inter-individual variation evaluate efficacy contact force-sensing catheter immediate PV isolation . Also , patient recur AF AT , would like evaluate long-term efficacy contact force-sensing catheter PV isolation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Between Contact Force Guided Blinded Strategy PV Isolation AF Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sixty patient randomize select right leave pulmonary vein whether apply contact force-guided ablation contact force-blinded ablation strategy . Each PV ablate contact force-sensing catheter ( Thermocool Smart Touch Catheter , Biosense Webster Inc. CA ) . The PV ( right left ) randomize contact force-sensing PV blind PV . Contact force-sensing PV ablate guide contact force , whereas blind PVs ablate without contact force-sensing information . The change impedance , total ablation time ablate PV collect analyse accord contact force-sensing strategy . After exit entrance block conventional method , dormant conduction evaluate use adenosine . The proportion dormant conduction compare contact force-sensing guide blinded strategy . During 1-year follow , patient recur AF AT undergo second ablation procedure . In patient , PV reconnection rate evaluate duodecapolar lasso circular mapping catheter . We would like know whether PVs ablate contact force-sensing information index procedure less reconnection ablate without contact force-sensing information .</detailed_description>
