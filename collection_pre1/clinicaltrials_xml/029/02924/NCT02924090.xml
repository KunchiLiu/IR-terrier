	<brief_title>Hyperventilation Combined With Etomidate Ketamine Anesthesia ECT Treatment Major Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) effective treatment medication-resistant form depression , include major depressive disorder mania . Therapeutic success ECT related duration quality Electroencephalogram ( EEG ) motor seizure . Previous study demonstrate deliberate hyperventilation augments seizure duration anesthetize subject . It also show seizure activity significantly increase cerebral metabolic rate , predispose patient potentially severe cerebral desaturation event . These desaturation event predict exacerbated pre-emptive hyperventilation potent cerebral vasoconstrictive effect . Despite widespread use ECT , little known effect hyperventilation cerebral metabolism set . Ketamine recently demonstrate anti-depressant property patient major depressive disorder , suggest patient treated ketamine anesthesia ECT , may benefit clinically additive effect treatment modality , compare ECT alone . The investigator hypothesize hyperventilation facilitate prolong seizure duration faster remission depressive symptom . As well may significant cerebral desaturation cardiovascular side effect ECT therapy follow hyperventilation . Lastly , effect hyperventilation efficacy ECT therapy may improve ketamine anesthesia use simultaneously . To test hypothesis study compare ketamine anesthesia etomidate anesthesia . Etomidate short act anesthetic commonly use procedure . The study objective ( primary secondary ) follow : 1 . To quantify effect hyperventilation type anesthetic agent ECT-induced seizure duration 2 . To assess effect hyperventilation immediately prior ECT cerebral metabolism measure cerebral oximetry 3 . To determine effect hyperventilation anesthetic agent remission symptom Major Depressive Disorder 4 . To assess side effect profile hyperventilation ECT hemodynamics</detailed_description>
