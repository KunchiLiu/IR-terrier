	<brief_summary>The aim study determine energy demand potential promote reduce blood pressure active video game ( AVG ) . Fourteen hypertensive ( 56.4 ± 7.5 year ) hold session AVG traditional sedentary video game session ( SVG ) walk ( WAL ) , negative positive control , order determine randomly . During session , observe oxygen consumption energy expenditure ( EE ) . Blood pressure ( BP ) cardiac autonomic modulation ( CAM ) measure rest every 15 minute 60 minute period recovery activity . It also apply rating scale pleasure ( enjoyment scale ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Volunteers : In previous pilot study , seven woman systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) rest 128.9 ± 9.4 mmHg obtain reduction 116.9 ± 7.0 mmHg 60 minute workout AVG . These data result effect size 1.05 . Adopting α error 0.05 statistical power 0.95 , estimate minimum sample size 12 volunteer . effectively participate study 14 hypertensive woman age 47 68 year ( 56.4 ± 7.5 year ) . In addition diagnosis hypertension , perform pressure value least 130/90 mmHg great 160/110 mmHg measurement make day study day data collection . They still postmenopausal woman , overweight obesity grade I ( BMI 25 34.9 kg / m2 ) , practice systematic physical exercise least three month suffer labyrinthitis . They would exclude study volunteer initiate antihypertensive treatment study period , present difficulty perform AVG game take four week complete experimental procedure . The research project approve Research Ethics Committee Health Science Center - UFPB nº0621 / 14 protocol . After informed procedure , volunteer sign Consent Informed ( IC ) accord resolution 466/12 National Health Council Brazil . Study design : volunteer hold AVG session , internal control session compose sedentary video game ( SVG ) external control session consist walk exercise ( WAL ) minimum 48 hour session order determine randomly . In session , activity , instrument portable gas analyzer measure energy expenditure ( EE ) accelerometer quantify perform movement heart rate monitor evaluate behavior heart rate ( HR ) . Blood pressure measurement ( BP ) cardiac autonomic modulation ( CAM ) perform rest every 15 minute period 60 minute recovery activity . In time applied rating scale pleasure activity ( enjoyment scale ) ( Figure 1 ) . Pre experimental procedure : prior experimental session , blood pressure measurement , physical activity blood collection make characterize participant . Personal information drug use collect give list contain rich food medicine caffeine could ingest 24 experimental session . Adaptation activity : participant underwent three session adaptation learn handle active sedentary game walk treadmill . The session last 10 40 minute , interval 48 hour session least 72 hour last session adaptation first test session . The intensity adopt session free , participant encourage achieve moderate intensity treadmill exercise ( 60 % 85 % maximum heart rate ) . They also teach respond subjective perception questionnaire effort enjoyment scale . Video active game : console Xbox 360 Kinect sensor ( Foxconn® , New Taipei , China ) game use Dance Central ( Harmonix Music Systems - Microsoft Games Studios ) . The difficulty level game adopt beginner , since participant previous experience AVG . In game use , bodily movement similar dance step use different song pop style refer 1970 , 1980 , 1990 2000 . The session last 40 minute . Video game sedentary : use Dance Dance Revolution® ( SSD Company Ltd. , Shiga , Japan ) Playstation 2® ( San Mateo , CA , USA ) , practitioner simulate synchronized dance similar song use gym , however use joystick traditionally know , remain seat throughout session . The duration game 40 minute . walk exercise : participant perform walk session treadmill ( Moviment , Brudden Ltda , São Paulo , Brazil ) last 40 minute previously prescribe intensity 60 % 80 % maximum heart rate . Accelerometry : accelerometer use brand Actigraph® GT3 X ( Pensacola , USA ) evaluate acceleration body , calibrate accord manufacturer 's specification . The adopted time interval 60 second output data express mean count per minute . The unit set waist height , right hand strap elastic adjustable buckle . At end record , data transfer computer analyze use SAS 9.2 software ( SAS Institute Inc. , Cary , NC 25513 ) . The adopted referêcia value 0-99 count / min-1 , consider sedentary activity , 100-1951 count / min-1 , light activity , 1952-5724 count / min-1 moderate activity 5725 count / min-1 , see vigorous activity , accord Freedson et al ( 113 ) Energy demand : make gas analysis analyzer portable lung gas K4b2 ( Cosmed Copyritgh © , Rome , Italy ) validate study McLaughlin et al ( 114 ) . This equipment enable verification breath , respiratory parameter , measure oxygen consumption ( VO2 ) carbon dioxide production exercise . The device calibrate accord manufacturer 's recommendation . The variable measure instrument DE VO2 . The measurement perform rest ( five minute ) experimental session . Heart rate perceive exertion : HR measure use heart rate monitor brand Polar RS800CX model ( Polar ElectroOy , Kempele , Finland ) . The measurement make 10 minute rest every 5 minute Durantes exercise . In time HR measure , Subjective Perception Scale Borg effort ( Noble Borg et al , 1983 ) , scale 6-20 point , present participant ask say feeling stress . Enjoyment Scale : This scale validate use adult population accord Graves et al . ( 2008 ) . It consist 18 item assess level pleasure / enjoyment level range `` I like '' `` I hate '' high sum point , pleasure / enjoyment activity perform provide . This scale present participant begin study session answer end study session . Blood pressure : start session , participant ask stay 15 minute rest sit . After period find rest BP . Further measure take immediately end experimental session every 15 minute 60-minute recovery period , volunteer seat throughout period . These measurement perform oscillometric method use ambulatory monitoring apparatus PA ( DYNAMAPA ) follow V Brazilian Guidelines BP ambulatory monitoring ( ABPM ) ( ALESSI , A ; BRANDÃO , A. ; . PIERIN et al , 2005 ) . three pressure tap make measure consider two close value . Cardiac Autonomic Modulation ( CAM ) : Immediately measurement BP , evaluate MAC HR variability , use monitor brand Polar RS800CX ( PolarElectroOy , Kempele , Finland ) . The volunteer seat record make minimum 10 minute . Data transfer computer provide software manufacturer transfer Kubios HRV software , version 2.0 ( University Kuopio , Finland ) . Data analyze time domain , consider average ( RRM ) standard deviation individual interval RR ( SDNN ) , root mean square successive difference adjacent RR ( RMSSD ) percentage successive difference RR interval great 50 m ( pNN50 ) . In frequency domain , consider low frequency band ( 0:04 00:15 Hz ) ( LF ) high frequency ( 0.15 0.4 Hz ) ( AF ) . It also adopt low ratio frequency / high frequency sympathetic-vagal balance ( LF / HF ) . Statistical analysis : Data mean standard error mean . Shapiro-Wilk test use verify normality Levene check homogeneity . One-way ANOVA use compare rest value . For comparison measurement experimental session , adopt two-way ANOVA test . Data analyze use GraphPad Prism 6.0 software ( GraphPad , San Diego , CA , USA ) , significance p &lt; 0.05 .</detailed_description>
