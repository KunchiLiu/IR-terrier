A major barrier family remind need child receive influenza vaccination . The investigator evaluate impact patient reminder/recall perform state immunization information system improve influenza vaccination rate use three clinical trial two state . The investigator assess effectiveness cost-effectiveness phone reminder/recall improve influenza vaccination rate .

	<brief_title>Centralized IIS-based Reminder/Recall Increase Childhood Influenza Vaccination Rates New York State</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Annual epidemic influenza A B cause substantial morbidity mortality US high rate hospitalization , emergency department visit , outpatient visit , medical cost . Children experience significant morbidity influenza also play key role instigate expand epidemic . In addition , concern pandemic influenza heighten importance new mechanism rapidly inform population influenza direct effort rapid vaccine delivery . Since 2010 , Advisory Committee Immunization Practices ( ACIP ) recommend influenza vaccination child &gt; 6 month age . However , vaccination rate remain low . For 2012-2013 season , 56 % child 2-17y vaccinate . Modeling study suggest many 19 million case influenza could prevent child vaccination rate raise 70 % nationally . The effective strategy recommend CDC Task Force Community Preventive Services improve childhood influenza vaccination rate reminder/recall ( R/R ) , send phone mail , notify parent need vaccinate child . The published literature suggest R/R improve influenza vaccination rate . However , practice use R/R ; barrier practice cost , insufficient staff time expertise , lack predictability regard receipt vaccine supply . Statewide immunization information system ( IISs ) exist state track vaccination . They yet use influenza vaccine R/R lack evidence effectiveness lack template IIS-based reminder/recall . The investigator unite two lead immunization research group ( Denver , CO Rochester , NY ) ass impact centralize IIS-based influenza vaccine reminder/recall , evaluate effect intensity recall ( 1 v. 2. v. 3 reminder ) usual care . The investigator also develop tool aid state create efficient IIS reminder/recall system . The investigator also develop tool aid state create efficient IIS reminder/recall system seasonal possible pandemic influenza outbreak . The study four aim : Aim 1 develop protocol , clinical decision support , message content state IISs conduct reminder/recall influenza vaccination . Aim 2 conduct pragmatic trial , randomization level patient within practice randomly select proportionate state , compare : 1 ) effectiveness cost-effectiveness centralized reminder/recall different intensity ( 1 v.2 v. 3 message ) usual care ( 0 message ) 2 ) effectiveness cost-effectiveness reminder/recall specify subgroup ( family medicine vs. pediatric provider , rural v urban , age child ) receipt influenza vaccination . Aim 3 measure effect add mail text message reminder/recall autodialer failure vs. autodialer-alone reminder/recall influenza vaccination rate use 2-arm randomize controlled trial . Aim 4 ( dissemination aim ) develop toolkit state IIS-based influenza vaccine reminder/recall seasonal pandemic influenza , work key stakeholder sustainability plan . By end study , investigator feasible cost-effective model raise child seasonal possibly pandemic influenza vaccination rate prevent influenza . The investigator disseminate IIS model state .</detailed_description>
