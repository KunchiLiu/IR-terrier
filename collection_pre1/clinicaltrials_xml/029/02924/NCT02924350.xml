Tooth modify gingival index ( MGI ) score =0 adjacent test area ( exposed dentine ) [ Lobene , 1986 ] clinical Tooth sign sensitivity measure qualify evaporative air assessment ( Y/N response ) mobility ≤1 , Tooth sign sensitivity measure qualify evaporative air assessment ( Y/N response ) At Visit 2 , Baseline ( Pretreatment ) : Minimum two , nonadjacent accessible teeth ( incisor , canine , premolar ) , meet follow criterion : Tooth sign sensitivity , measure qualify tactile stimulus ( Yeaple ≤ 20g ) evaporative air assessment ( Schiff sensitivity score ≥ 2 ) Teeth meet EAR , MGI mobility inclusion criterion none dentition exclusion criterion Screening assess tactile stimulus Visit 2 . Those teeth meet require tactile threshold ( Yeaple ≤ 20g ) assess evaporative air stimulus .
