	<brief_summary>Multicenter randomize trial demonstrate safety efficacy intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor ( anti-VEGF ) agent treatment diabetic macular edema . The result generally good short term , approximately 75 % patient maintain improve vision initiation treatment . Despite favorable outcome , observation persistent fluid infrequent treatment , even patient undergo monthly treatment session . Persistent fluid observe optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) 70.9 % patient receive bevacizumab monthly 79 % receive bevacizumab need end first year Comparison diabetic macular edema . Treatment Trials . It possible resolution fluid , especially centrally locate ( i.e. , foveal ) , might result good visual outcome . A drug high VEGF-binding affinity may help patient persistent fluid despite treatment bevacizumab . Aflibercept new intravitreal VEGF antagonist approve 28 November 2014 Health Canada treatment diabetic macular edema . In contrast antibody-based VEGF binding strategy use bevacizumab , aflibercept incorporate second bind domain VEGFR-1 receptor third domain VEGFR-2 receptor . By fuse extracellular protein sequence Fc segment human IgG backbone , developer create chimeric protein high VEGF binding affinity . Aflibercept bind isomer VEGF-A family like bevacizumab , also bind VEGF-B placental growth factor 1 2,1,2 implicated pathogenesis diabetic retinopathy age-related macular degeneration . In addition , increase trough binding activity strong bind affinity , aflibercept efficacious neutralize VEGF effectively long duration .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In study patient recruitment , clinical care follow-up conduct : Dr Flavio Rezende : Principal-Investigator Dr Radwan Ajlan : Co-Investigator . 1 . Purpose : To evaluate visual acuity outcomes macular change 6 12 month intravitreal aflibercept ( 2.0 mg ) eye persistent center involve diabetic macular edema despite intravitreal bevacizumab therapy . 2 . Overall Goal Study : The goal study evaluate effect aflibercept macular edema patient diabetic macular edema resistant bevacizumab . 3 . Specific objective : To evaluate visual acuity outcomes macular change 6 12 month intravitreal aflibercept ( 2.0 mg ) eye persistent foveal fluid secondary diabetic macular edema despite previous optimum gold standard therapy intravitreal bevacizumab . More specifically , ass : - Mean change central subfield thickness ( CST ) baseline , 6 month switch aflibercept . - Mean change CST baseline , 12 month switch aflibercept . - Mean change best correct visual acuity ( BCVA ) baseline , 6 month switch aflibercept . - Mean change BCVA baseline , 12 month switch aflibercept 4 . Study Design : Phase 4 open label clinical trial . Intravitreal injection 0.05 mL ( 2mg ) aflibercept inject . The intravitreal first 5 treatment session 4 week , intravitreal follow treatment session week 52 8 week . 5 . Subjects : 40 patient see retinal clinic Hospital Maisonneuve-Rosemont foveal fluid secondary diabetic macular edema despite previous optimum gold standard therapy intravitreal bevacizumab assess eligibility .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Eyes include series must least six consecutive monthly intravitreal injection bevacizumab treatment diabetic macular edema present tomographic signal suggestive foveal fluid spectraldomain optical coherence tomography ( SDOCT ) 4 week last treatment session . The interval last 3 consecutive bevacizumab treatment interval last bevacizumab SDOCT image exceed 37 day . Persistent foveal fluid define observation hyporeflective space OCT fovea ( fovea centralis ) , measure approximately 1.5 mm ( 1500 μm ) one disc diameter size center macular umbo . Tomographic change measure SDOCT use macular thickness map . BCVA must well 20/800 . Only 1 eye patient include study . If eye affect , good see eye include , since previous meaningful difference find patient 20/40 well treat bevacizumab aflibercept.3 An ocular medium opacity might interfere visual acuity , assessment toxicity , photographic fundus documentation macular area . A history vitrectomy . Known coagulation abnormality , stroke , recurrent use anticoagulative medication aspirin . Pregnancy , plan pregnancy study time frame follow 3 month . Patients actively undergo ocular treatment option topical nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug NSAIDs , topical steroid , intravitreal steroid injection exclude study .</criteria>
