	<brief_title>The Chocolate Touch Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective Chocolate Touch study demonstrate non-inferior safety non-inferior effectiveness Chocolate Touch™ compare Lutonix® drug coat balloon catheter . These data intend show safety effectiveness Chocolate Touch sufficient support regulatory approval market device United States use superficial femoral popliteal artery . Study success define statistical demonstration non-inferiority hypothesis test primary safety effectiveness hypothesis .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Minimum 18 year age 2 . Intermittent claudication ischemic rest pain ( Rutherford 24 ) 3 . Life Expectancy &gt; 2 year 4 . Patient agree followup requirement give informed consent 5 . Lesion successfully cross guidewire 6 . Lesion superficial femoral popliteal artery 7 . Target lesion &gt; 70 % stenosis 8 . Reference Vessel Diameter 3.5 &amp; 6.0mm within treatment range Chocolate Touch use 1:1.1 Target Lesion 9 . Target Lesion &lt; 15cm consist two adjacent lesion ( &lt; 25mm apart ) able completely cover inflation two assign balloon 10 . Angiographic evidence distal runoff demonstrate least one patent tibial vessel without evidence significant ( &gt; 70 % ) stenosis origin ankle 11 . Inflow vessel without significant stenosis ( &lt; 70 % ) successful treatment ( &lt; 30 % residual stenosis complication ) diseased iliac vessel 1 . Acute limb ischemia , patient indicate thrombolytic therapy 2 . Planned surgery within 30 day include intervention nontarget limb 3 . Target Limb concurrent intervention involve reentry device , atherectomy , laser , ablation procedure , use drug elute stent , , treatment drug coat balloon 4 . Myocardial infarction stroke within 30 day prior procedure 5 . Known intolerance require medication , contrast medium , nitinol , Paclitaxel 6 . Known impaired Renal Function could impact contrast tolerance Glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) ≤ 30 ml/min per 1.73 m^2 and/or elevate serum creatinine &gt; 2.5mg/dL ( 220µmol/L ) 7 . Known bleed disorder uncontrolled hypercoagulable disorder 8 . Nonatherosclerotic lesion ( e.g . vasculitis Berger 's disease ) 9 . Female pregnant intend pregnant study 10 . Patient enrol another clinical study previously enrol study 11 . Presence perforation , dissection injury access site target vessel time enrollment 12 . Severe Calcification target lesion ( defined angiographic evidence dense calcification present side vessel wall two orthogonal view extend &gt; 5 continuous cm length ) 13 . Previous bypass graft stent target vessel , OR , iliac stent permit cross treatment balloon within introducer sheath</criteria>
