	<detailed_description>Patients severe acquire brain injury ( ABI ) require early intensive rehabilitation part consist physical exercise . Studies find association higher-level physical activity final outcome patient ABI . A higher-level activity patient severe ABI disorder consciousness consist primarily mobilization upright stand position tilt-table . Intense high level activity severe ABI patient usually initiate acute stage injury rather later , sub acute stage ( week ) , patient stabilize transfer highly specialized rehabilitation unit . Andelic et al ( 2012 ) conduct non-randomized cohort study investigate effect early rehabilitation intensive care unit . Although consistency rehabilitation paradigm unspecified , observe benefit early intervention . A recent randomize pilot study 31 patient acute severe ABI disorder consciousness conclude early mobilization use tilt-table integrated stepping increase venous return blood heart , could conduct safely , significant improvement three month . The hypothesis early mobilization patient severe traumatic brain injury lead well functional outcome discharge rehabilitation unit one year post injury compare patient receive usual care need test large clinical trial . In parallel , physiological change patient experience due injury wast amount bed rest possible association patient ' clinical outcome explore . Training often limit orthostatic intolerance . The physiological mechanism cause orthostatic hypotension recovery thoroughly investigate . In patient population neurally mediate syncope orthostatic hypotension , intensive tilt-table training show beneficial . In addition , recent study include large number ABI patient find association impaired cerebral autoregulation measure first day injury unfavorable outcome . This study investigate occurrence time recovery orthostatic tolerance cerebral autoregulation severe TBI patient receive early intense mobilization relation functional outcome , compare patient receive usual care . The intervention group receive early intensive mobilization programme head-up tilt , stay intensive care unit throughout early stage rehabilitation . Mobilization conduct use tilt-table integrated stepping ( The ERIGO® HOCOMA company Switzerland ) . The programme conduct supplement patient 's usual care.The tilt-table intervention apply five time per week maximum four week stay neurointensive care unit . Each session consist 20 min . mobilization . Within session patient move tilt-table secure strap harness . The patient mobilize step wise 30° , 50° 70° head-up tilt one min . interval blood pressure , heart rate , respiratory rate closely monitor . Cerebral perfusion pressure intracranial pressure monitor relevant . If time predetermine safety limit blood pressure , cerebral perfusion pressure , intracranial pressure heart rate violate , patient lower 0° tilt ( supine position ) . This procedure continue patient tilted upright maximum 20 min . total duration 40 min . head-up tilt procedure reach . If patient discharge intensive care unit four week , train continue department neurorehabilitation pre-specified tilt-table protocol consist mobilization twice day similar tilt-table . Patients show functional improvement beyond scope tilt-table training ( e.g . able stand chair ) study period end , final evaluation perform immediately hereafter subsequently standard rehabilitation regimen continue . The control group receive standard care consist interdisciplinary rehabilitation . A small part standard care consist mobilize patient edge bed wheelchair . At inclusion patient randomize either group open end blind randomization procedure , stratification accord patient Glasgow Coma Score time ( 3-6 7-10 ) . The randomization consist block random size , except first block consist 10 patient . These 10 patient analysed safety reason . Assuming normality assumption violate functional score physiological data analyse analysis variance ( ANOVA ) linear regression model take account two measure time . Between-group analysis demographic data perform use Student 's test unequal variance analysis two group chi-square test nominal data .</detailed_description>
