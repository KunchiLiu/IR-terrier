	<detailed_description>Overdose poisoning cardioactive drug serious consequence . In recent year , intravenous lipid emulsion emerge possible treatment option otherwise treatment-resistant cardiovascular collapse cause poisoning cardio-active drug . Experimental evidence obtain animal study indicate beneficial effect intravenous lipid emulsion treatment poison various cardio-toxic medication . Based finding , first report case use intravenous lipid emulsion treatment human cardiotoxicity cause poisoning local anesthetic publish 2006 . Subsequently , steadily increase number case report concern use intravenous lipid emulsion resuscitation treatment various medication poisoning publish . Often patient either cardiac arrest severe circulatory failure treat accord guideline advance life support prior lipid emulsion therapy . It noteworthy common observation follow bolus infusion lipid emulsion rapid hemodynamic stabilization patient . Despite increase use intravenous lipid emulsion treatment poison patient , mechanism behind lipid rescue elucidate . The widely accept hypothesis , `` lipid sink/sponge '' model , suggest intravenous lipid emulsion entraps xenobiotics intravascularly , thereby prevent reach site toxicity . Additionally , intravenous lipid emulsion may redistribute xenobiotics area higher lipid content . However , mechanisms action lipid emulsion , support observation animal experiment , vasoconstrictive cardio-tonic effect . These effect could secondary direct activation sodium , potassium calcium channel myocardium , alternatively fatty acid-induced modulation metabolic property mitochondrion . Both mechanism could result hemodynamic stabilization . The potential beneficial effect lipid emulsion hemodynamic instability beyond lipid sink lead notion intravenous lipid emulsion could valuable treatment poisoning non-lipophilic xenobiotics . At present , remain however unclear extent evidence concern resuscitation poison patient lipid emulsion may reflect publication bias . To knowledge , one control human trial conduct present . In randomized crossover study , Litonius et al . investigated effect lipid emulsion plasma concentration bupivacaine eight healthy subject . It find lipid emulsion lower total plasma concentration bupivacaine . This attribute altered distribution contradict hypothesis lipid sink-mechanism fraction non-lipid bound bupivacaine unchanged . The mechanism lipid emulsion may attenuate effect cardio toxic xenobiotics must therefore still regard undecided . This lack evidence call human study order elucidate pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic consequence intravenous lipid emulsion . The purpose double blind , randomize placebo-controlled crossover clinical trial investigate effect intravenous lipid emulsion pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic property adrenoceptor antagonist metoprolol human model beta blocker overdose . The study include total five visit ; screen visit four trial day . At screen visit , anthropometric data ( weight , height , blood pressure pulse ) measure . Additionally , blood sample collect accordance exclusion criterion . A spot urine sample measure albumin/creatinine ratio collect electrocardiogram ( ECG ) record verify normality heart rhythm electrical impulse . In addition , investigator carry clinical examination . Based clinical examination , urine blood test ECG measurement , investigator assess whether trial participant meet inclusion criterion exclusion criterion . After screen inclusion , participant invite four trial day trial site . On day participant require fast 10 hour ( include water , coffee tobacco ) . A peripheral venous line insert antecubital vein . An arterial catheter connect pressure transducer insert radial artery wrist . In randomized order , one four intervention perform ( see ) . A standard 12 lead ECG place participant well 5 lead ECG connect computer . At T=0 , metoprolol intravenous solution ( 0.5 mg metoprolol/ml metoprolol tartrate ) placebo administer intravenous bolus injection . Continuous infusion metoprolol/placebo administer T=30 minute . Infusion halt heart rate drop 35 bpm systolic blood pressure drop 80 mm Hg , participant experience subjective side effect . Infusion stop T=30 minute . Intravenous lipid emulsion ( Intralipid 20 % ) saline solution shortly thereafter administer intravenous bolus infusion ( 1.5 ml/kg ) follow continuous infusion ( infusion rate : 0.25 ml/kg/min ) . Lipid emulsion/dummy infusion stop T = 30 minute . One gram paracetamol administer disintegrate tablet dissolve 50 ml water give per o shortly study start day . Repeated ECG 's record blood drawn measurement routine biochemistry parameter serum concentration metoprolol paracetamol . A drop blood use test glucose level use blood glucose meter . Cardiovascular parameter ( heart rate , blood pressure , pulse contour curve/arterial pressure wave ) record via arterial catheter pressure transducer connect computer . The participant closely monitor site T=120 minute .</detailed_description>
