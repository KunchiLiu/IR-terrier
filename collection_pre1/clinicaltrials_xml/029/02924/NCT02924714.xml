	<brief_summary>The trial `` The stop-GIST trial '' Oslo University Hospital sponsor , prospective , open-label , 1-group , multicenter phase II trial evaluate discontinuation imatinib highly select patient treat imatinib longer 5 year oligo-metastatic GIST ( ≤ 3 metastasis ) detectable overt GIST lesion CT/MRI image follow complete surgical resection ( R0/R1-resection ) radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) metastases .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SSG XXV : The Stop-GIST Trial ; Discontinuation Imatinib Patients With Oligo-metastatic GIST</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients metastatic GIST currently recommend life-long treatment tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) . The standard first-line treatment imatinib , switch drug progression patient tolerate imatinib . The prevailing hypothesis imatinib TKIs fail completely eradicate metastatic GIST progression inevitable imatinib treatment discontinue . However , SSGXVIII/AIO trial find 3 year adjuvant imatinib yield superior RFS OS rate compare 1 year adjuvant imatinib , find exclude hypothesis sufficiently long administration imatinib might sometimes eradicate subclinical GIST . Furthermore , retrospective study report favorable survival outcome surgery residual disease metastatic GIST patient respond imatinib , subset ( approximately 20 % ) patient advanced GIST progress within first 10 year imatinib . Imatinib treatment come potential side-effects , , considerable cost society . Therefore , discontinuation imatinib highly select patient , i.e . receive imatinib longer 5 year undergone metastasectomy macroscopic oligometastatic disease , need explored novel treatment strategy . Discontinuation might lead detection durable complete remission without imatinib even cure .</detailed_description>
