	<brief_summary>Endoscopic ultrasonography ( EUS ) essential technique require diagnosis pancreatobiliary disease . In previous study , 6 % patient undergone EUS significant throat pain . ( NRS scale 5 great ) Although endoscopists think balloon inflation EUS insertion could result decrease throat damage pain , data back . We design single center randomize pilot study compare throat pain cause EUS insertion conventional vs balloon inflation method .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison Endoscopic Ultrasound Insertion Methods</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patient undergo EUS radial type echoendoscope ask informed consent . Subjects randomize conventional insertion arm balloon inflate insertion arm . All patient sedate accord SNUH endoscopy center protocol . Conventional insertion do conventional insertion group , balloon inflation start procedure do balloon inflated insertion arm . After EUS procedure finish , subject move recovery room . As soon subject recover sedation , throat pain assess NRS scale recoreded . Information insertion failure balloon damage insertion also collect .</detailed_description>
