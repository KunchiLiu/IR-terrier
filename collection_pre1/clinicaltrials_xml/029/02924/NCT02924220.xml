	<detailed_description>Context : Listeriosis rare , severe foodborne infection cause bacterium Listeria monocytogenes ( Lm ) . It manifest septicemia , central nervous system ( CNS ) infection maternal-fetal ( MF ) infection . Its associated overall mortality high , 30 % . A good knowledge factor involve occurrence clinical manifestation therefore need improve outcome . Surveillance human listeriosis France rely mandatory reporting case submission correspond Lm strain National Reference Centre Listeria ( NRCL ) . A number acquire risk factor listeriosis identify , pregnancy , age , cirrhosis , renal insufficiency , diabetes , cancer , HIV infection , transplantation immunosuppressive therapy . If listeriosis rare , exposure Lm universal . The high prevalence know risk factor general population low occurrence disease suggest unknown parameter , host genetic factor , contribute susceptibility listeriosis . This support animal study , show gene involve innate cell-based immunity critical control listeriosis . However , genetic study host susceptibility listeriosis human perform far , absence prospective collection patient ' sample . Listeriosis diagnosis base Lm culture clinical sample . This specific method lack sensitivity , usefulness PCR serological assay assess prospective case-control study . Biomarkers useful tool diagnose infection assess severity , contribution listeriosis diagnosis prognosis evaluate . The Multicentric Observational NAtional Analysis Listeriosis Listeria ( MONALISA ) , national case-control prospective study listeriosis , launched 2009 . It enroll culture-proven case declare NRCL : clinical biological data biological sample ( plasma , serum , PBMC ) collect inclusion patient . Controls comparable background presentation also include . 818 case include ( 427 S , 252 CNS 107 MN ) 3.5 year , along 456 control . Hypothesis : - host genetic variation play important role determine susceptibility listeriosis clinical manifestation . Common host genetic variation human population may play role susceptibility association know acquire risk factor . Rare variant may also explain severe manifestation listeriosis , death , severe persistent neurological impairment fetal loss , absence risk factor . - biomarker pattern assess predict infection infection severity . Immune response may track biological signature invasive listeriosis - biomarkers pattern could hopefully correlate genotypic characterization phenotypic reflection genetically inadequate / miss link hamper proper coordination immune response Lm . Methods : - SNP array genotyping whole cohort - Whole-exome sequencing whole cohort identify rare variant - Biomarkers identification serum plasma patient control simultaneous multi-analyte metabolomic profiling : The cohort already constitute . Expected result : Better understand major biomedical aspect listeriosis , namely host genetic susceptibility factor diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers .</detailed_description>
