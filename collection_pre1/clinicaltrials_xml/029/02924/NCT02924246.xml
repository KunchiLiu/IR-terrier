	<brief_summary>Rationale : Oral vaccination know induce systemic immune response well immune response mucosal tissue , therefore serve model study systemic mucosal immunity . In study , oral cholera vaccine DukoralÂ® chosen model vaccine . The kinetics immune response interaction raw milk matrix evaluate previous , pilot study ( NL49042.081.14 ) . Based outcomes pilot , study oral cholera vaccination apply study support immunity raw milk , compare heat-treated milk . The study design optimise base previous result : study duration extend sample size base relevant change know variation primary outcome parameter . Infections important worldwide cause death , elderly young child . Therefore , support immunity could help reduce incidence infection . To screen potential specific food food ingredient support immunity , oral vaccination serve model . In previous study , model develop use oral cholera vaccination human adult volunteer . In study , raw milk show support immune response vaccination . In follow-up study , effect raw milk compare pasteurized ultra-heat treat ( UHT ) milk . Objective : To investigate whether pasteurized milk and/or UHT milk able enhance immune response induce oral cholera vaccination , comparison raw milk regular vaccination . Study design : The study design single-blind randomized control trial 6 week . Study population : Healthy subject 18-50 year age . Interventions : 1 ) Raw milk , obtain farm comply high quality requirement production raw milk , screen accord safety criterion raw milk ; 2 ) commercially available full-fat UHT milk ; 3 ) commercially available full-fat pasteurize milk .</brief_summary>
