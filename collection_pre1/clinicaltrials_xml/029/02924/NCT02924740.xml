	<detailed_description>Urinary incontinence ( UI ) define International Urogynecological Association International Continence Society ( IUGA/ICS ) complaint involuntary loss urine objectively show cause hygienic social problem . Stress urinary incontinence ( SUI ) define involuntary loss urine effort physical exertion , sneeze cough . Pelvic Floor Muscle Training ( PFMT ) basis conservative treatment woman SUI . In systematic review , PFMT recommend first option treatment SUI . The aim PFMT improve sphincter activity increase support bladder urethra . Recommendations regard prevention treatment SUI PFMT include Knack maneuver ( conscious contraction pelvic floor abdominal pressure increase ) ; pelvic floor exercise enhance structural support endurance pelvic floor muscle ; add transversus abdominis contraction ; functional rehabilitation . It report progressive overload principle consider improve muscle strength endurance . According principal , resistance movement , duration and/or frequency increase obtain optimal response . There lot method run muscle muscle group base progressive overload principal . These add resistance weight , increase duration number contraction , change type exercise range movement . In literature , report special vaginal rectal tool , vaginal cone tampon might use establish resistance pelvic floor muscle exercise . Kashanian et al . find effect exercise apply Kegelmaster device similar PFMT woman SUI mixed type UI . Vaginal cone , develop 1985 Plevnik , weight put vagina levator plateau . The theory use vaginal cone feel slip perceive , reflex voluntary contraction pelvic floor muscle occur avoid slipping . It report use cone question term exercise physiology . Holding cone 15-20 minute may result decreased blood supply , decrease oxygen consumption , muscle fatigue pain , contraction muscle . On hand , use cone different way may provide extra benefit patient : patient instruct perform pelvic floor muscle contraction try pull cone tool vagina . In study , investigator prefer use vaginal tampon since pull cone vagina cause elimination weight cone . Vaginal tampon also sterile , hygienic , single use . There also study investigates effect vaginal tampon exercise literature . Therefore , aim study investigate effect vaginal tampon train add PFMT symptom urinary incontinence , strength endurance pelvic floor muscle quality life . Vaginal tampon train applied 5 day week 12 week . Vaginal tampon exercise perform two day week physiotherapist ( first author ) three day week patient . One set tampon exercise consist 15 contraction . During vaginal tampon training , week 1 week 12 , patient instruct perform two set exercise five day week ( two day physiotherapist , three day ) . Both group complete PFMT consist fast ( 2 second ) slow contraction ( 5-s contraction , 10-s hold , 5-s relaxation , totally 20-s ) . One set exercise include ten fast ten slow voluntary PFM contraction ( VPFMCs ) . During week 1 2 , participant instruct perform two set exercise per day ( 20 fast 20 slow contraction per day ) , progressively increase two set : four set per day week 3 4 ( 40 fast 40 slow contraction per day ) ; six set per day week 5 6 ( 60 fast 60 slow contraction per day ) ; eight set per day week 7 8 ( 80 fast 80 slow contraction per day ) ; ten set per day week 9 week 12 ( 100 fast 100 slow contraction per day ) . Patients advise exercise supine , seat , upright position integrate exercise daily activity , e.g. , watch television , wait something , travel .</detailed_description>
