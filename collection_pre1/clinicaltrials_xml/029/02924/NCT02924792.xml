	<brief_title>Sternal Intraosseous Transfusion Autologous Whole Blood : A Comparison Flow Rates Degree Hemolysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intraosseous ( IO ) access old technique achieve entrance systemic circulation , gain resurgence last 30 year . Whether due trauma disease , vascular collapse may delay preclude even experienced medical provider obtain standard intravenous ( IV ) access . Access vascular system critically ill injure adult pediatric patient essential resuscitation , flow rate close obtain use intravenous access preferable patient need immediate fluid bolus shock resuscitation . Intraosseous access take advantage vascularity cancellous bone , spongy bone inside hard , access highly vascular intramedullary space bone provide direct link central circulation . In addition use long bone , sternum use intraosseous access gain increase use especially combat casualty care . However , recent publication , intraosseous route use transfusion blood component question . Based theoretical model flow rate porous medium personal clinical observation author conclude maximum flow rate attainable transfusion blood via intraosseous route inadequate successful resuscitation . They also fear additional pressure need obtain adequate flow rate may cause hemolysis red blood cell . Further postulate bone mineral density reach peak occur early 20 , small increase bone density may cause exponential decrease intrinsic permeability , could 10-fold decrease permeability military age causality compare elderly . The critical point highlight review great contrast recent experience use sternal humeral I.O ` Operation Enduring Freedom ( OEF ) . In observational study investigate impact two CE mark FDA approve sternal needle comparison intravenous access flow-rate autologous reinfusion whole blood possible hemolysis red cell post-transfusion population healthy military officer . We also investigate technical success rate sternal IO Access two CE mark FDA approve sternal Devices . As supplementary investigation seek investigate anatomic change show Magnetic Resonance Imaging individual receive multiple intraosseous sternal needle With autologous reinfusion whole blood .</detailed_description>
