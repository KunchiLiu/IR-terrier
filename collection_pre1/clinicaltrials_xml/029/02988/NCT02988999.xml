	<detailed_description>Subjects method Study product The test product pure D-allulose rare sugar . The control product non-calorie sweetener erythritol . Study design This single center , prospective , randomized , control trial . After informed consent obtain , history take physical examination perform ensure patient meet inclusion criterion exclusion criterion . At screen day , venous blood sample collect follow overnight fast least 8 hour . Complete blood count ( CBC ) , chemistry include fast plasma glucose ( FPG ) , glycated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) , insulin , blood urea nitrogen ( BUN ) , creatinine , lipid profile ( total cholesterol , HDL-C , LDL-C , triglyceride , low-density lipoprotein ) , blood urea nitrogen , creatinine , total protein , Albumin , albumin/globulin ratio , glutamine oxaloacetic transaminase ( GOT ) , glutamic pyruvic transaminase ( GPT ) , Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase ( GGT ) , lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) , total bilirubin ( include Direct Indirect ) , alkaline phosphatase , uric acid , plasma amylase , cholinesterase , Sodium , Chloride , potassium , carbon dioxide , Calcium , inorganic phosphate , magnesium , plasma iron measure . Urine collect urinalysis urine pregnancy test perform exclude pregnant woman study . Visceral fat area ( VFA ) , subcutaneous fat area ( SFA ) , total fat area ( TFA ) measure abdominal CT scan umbilical level ( L4 ) bioelectrical impedance D-7 screening visit . The eligible subject randomize equal probability receive either pure D-allulose 5 g 3 time day 30 min meal right meal ( liquid ) plus conventional therapy placebo ( non-calorie sweetener erythritol ) 5 g 3 time day 30 min meal right meal ( liquid ) plus conventional therapy 24 week . Both subject investigator blind type product . Subjects group instruct modify lifestyle control diet 1200 kcal woman 1500 kcal men increase physical activity . Subjects ask 3-d food record per week ( 2 work day 1 weekend ) entire study . Subjects need record exercise include type duration study . Subjects ask visit every 4 week follow-up totally 9 visit include screen day D -7 , D0 , end week 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 20 , 24 4 week post intervention ( end week 28 ) 29 week duration . Assessment insulin resistance index ( IRI ) calculate homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance ( HOMA-IR ) use FPG ( mmol/L ) multiply fast insulin ( U/ml ) divide 22.5 . The satisfaction product ask 4 week , 12 week 24 week consumption study product . From visit 1 visit 8 , blood sample screen measure . At screen visit , visit 4 visit 7 , CT abdomen measurement conduct . At visit 1 visit 7 , adiponectin , leptin , tumor necrosis factor -alpha measure . At visit 1 , visit 4 , visit 7 visit 8 , lipid profile measure include low-density lipoprotein Chylomicron fractionation , Apolipoprotein ( AI , AII，C-III , E ) , Apolipoprotein ( B48 , B100 ) , nonesterified fatty acid Adverse Event Assessment At visit , subject ask open question he/she experience abnormal symptom . Any symptom report subject recorded adverse event detail event , severity , start stop date , relationship study product . Withdrawal criteria 1 . Consume study product le 90 % treatment period 2 . Start take medication may affect body weight study .</detailed_description>
