	<brief_title>Intranasal Insulin Improving Cognitive Function Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cognitive impairment common devastate people MS. MS common , chronic , central nervous system ( CNS ) disease characterize inflammation , demyelination , neurodegeneration . One devastate symptom disease impair cognitive function , common present 60 % individual MS. MS-related cognitive impairment associate lower quality life reduce functional capacity , include loss employment , impaired social relationship , compromise drive safety , poor adherence treatment . Impaired cognitive functioning observe early disease , sometimes even diagnosis , cognitive function show decline longitudinally , short- long-term . Several cognitive domain impact people MS , include attention , memory , executive functioning , especially process speed . To date , multiple pharmacologic intervention assess disappointing result . There significant difference treatment placebo cognition randomize control trial donepezil , aminopyridines , gingko biloba , memantine . Psychostimulants demonstrate efficacy , secondary outcome measure . Behavioral intervention show promise understudied . Furthermore , cognitive rehabilitation often time consume , costly , universally available . Hence , urgent need identify develop novel therapy help improve cognitive function MS. Intranasal insulin extremely safe tolerable population , allow concentrated delivery nervous system . An intranasal delivery system provide non-invasive way bypass blood-brain barrier allow rapid delivery medication CNS via olfactory trigeminal perivascular channels.The main advantage delivery system reduce systemic side effect via limit medication 's exposure peripheral organ tissue . Insulin administration show improve memory learn healthy people neurodegenerative disease . Intranasal insulin show neuroprotective restorative effect several human clinical trial . Overall , finding suggest intranasal insulin affect cognitive function acutely , time , may associate structural change lead permanent treatment benefit . Cognitive dysfunction common MS devastating , therefore treatment intervention ( i.e. , intranasal insulin ) help acutely longitudinally . The primary aim study assess safety tolerability intranasal insulin people MS . The secondary aim evaluate intranasal insulin improve learn memory people MS . The third aim evaluate impact intranasal insulin measure oxidative stress , axonal injury , cellular stress , energy metabolism MS .</detailed_description>
