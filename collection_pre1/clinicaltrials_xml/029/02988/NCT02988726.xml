	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Current therapy adults recurrent/residual Neurofibroma Schwannoma provide limit benefit patient . The anti-cancer property Antineoplaston therapy suggest may prove beneficial treatment adult recurrent/residual Neurofibroma Schwannoma . PURPOSE : This study perform determine effect ( good bad ) Antineoplaston therapy adult recurrent/residual Neurofibroma Schwannoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Antineoplaston Therapy Treating Patients With Neurofibroma Schwannoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OVERVIEW : This single arm , open-label study adult recurrent/residual Neurofibroma Schwannoma receive gradually escalate dos intravenous Antineoplaston therapy ( Atengenal + Astugenal ) maximum tolerate dose reach . Treatment continue least 12 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . OBJECTIVES : - To determine efficacy Antineoplaston therapy adult recurrent/residual Neurofibroma Schwannoma , measure objective response therapy ( complete response , partial response stable disease ) . - To determine safety tolerance Antineoplaston therapy adult recurrent/residual Neurofibroma Schwannoma . - To determine objective response , tumor size measure utilizing MRI scan , perform every 8 week first two year , every 3 month third fourth year , every 6 month 5th sixth year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 20-40 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically confirm incurable Neurofibroma Schwannoma . Histological confirmation waive tumor location biopsy safely perform . There exclusion base multifocality , leptomeningeal systemic metastasis . The tumor must least 5 mm size . Radiologic evidence residual recurrent tumor gadoliniumenhanced MRI perform 14 day begin therapy . Patients previously receive radiation therapy , chemotherapy , immunotherapy cytodifferentiating agent eligible . Patients receive standard therapy eligible . Patients may male female . If female , patient must pregnant breastfeed infant , either incapable become pregnant currently use contraceptive method . Acceptable method include birth control pill , use diaphragm , intrauterine device , condom patient 's sexual partner . If male , patient use appropriate contraception , condom , study least 4 week follow completion study . Patient must sign Informed Consent Document indict awareness experimental nature study . In event patient impairment high intellectual function , example , aphasia , patient 's legal next kin legal guardian must sign Informed Consent Document indicate awareness experimental nature study . Patient must fully recover operative procedure life expectancy two month . The patient 's performance status consistent outpatient therapy , i.e. , 60 % 100 % Karnofsky . The use corticosteroid permit reduce symptom attribute cerebral edema . It recommend small dose use compatible preservation optimal neurological function . Minimal hematological parameter include hemoglobin least 9 g/dL , white blood count least 1500 , platelet count least 50,000 . Patients evidence hepatic renal insufficiency ; total serum bilirubin creatinine high 2.5 mg/dL ; SGOT SGPT high 5 time upper limit normal . Patients must recover adverse effect previous therapy . At least eight week must lapse since last dose radiation therapy least four week must lapse since last dose chemotherapy ( six week nitrosoureas ) immunotherapy . Failure meet inclusion criterion . Patient either pregnant breast feeding infant . Patient high medical psychiatric risk , nonmalignant systemic disease , would , opinion investigator , make therapy investigational agent unwise . Patient incompetent give inform consent treatment . However , patient may admit legally appoint guardian give consent . Presence active infection . Patients know chronic heart failure serious lung disease , severe COPD . Patients hypertension exclude unless hypertension adequately control . Patients prior Antineoplaston treatment exclude protocol . Patients adequate hepatic function .</criteria>
