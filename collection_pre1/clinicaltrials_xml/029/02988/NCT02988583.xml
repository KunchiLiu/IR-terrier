	<brief_title>Emulsification Different Viscosity Silicone Oil After Complicated Retinal Detachment Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Silicone oil use surgical tool retinal detachment surgery since 1962 . The National Eye Institute Silicone Study demonstrate superiority silicone oil compare sulfur hexafluoride , comparability perfluoropropane , treatment complicate retinal detachment associate advanced proliferative vitreoretinopathy . There complication occur par plana vitrectomy silicone oil tamponade . These complication may occur surgery surgery . Silicone oil emulsification one complication may result severe sequel include band-shaped keratopathy , complicate glaucoma retinopathy difficult treat . The commonly use silicone oil include low viscosity high viscosity type . It believe low viscosity silicone oil risk develop emulsification high viscosity silicone oil . Up , however , conclusive guideline type silicone oil suitable complicate retinal detachment surgery appropriate time remove oil . Retrospective medical review patient use 1000-vs 5000-centistoke silicone oil demonstrate anatomic visual acuity outcome , well complication rate include emulsification , similar group . To best author ' knowledge , prospective study subject . This study aim study silicone oil emulsification compare low viscosity high viscosity silicone oil complicate retinal detachment surgery .</detailed_description>
