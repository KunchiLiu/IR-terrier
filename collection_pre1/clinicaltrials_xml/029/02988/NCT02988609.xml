	<brief_summary>This study assess putative persistence neural damage use rest state fMRI concussion rugby player clinically recover . The hypothesis despite clinical recovery ( absence symptom ; neurological neuropsychological examination return normal ) connectivity map obtain use rest state fMRI significantly different group control subject .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Concussion Rugby Players : Pilote Study Neural Recovery Using fMRI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Resting state fMRI show sensitive tool assess neural damage concussion . It seem sensible structural MRI include DTI . study goal ass rugby player use fMRI 3 different time concussion : concussion ( V1 ) , player clinically recover ( V2 ) 3 month V2 ( V3 ) . The study would specifically like challenge clinical examination suppose normal V2 connectivity map use rest state fMRI preform time . fMRI perform V1 V3 serve comparators ( respectively alter V1 back normal V3 ) .</detailed_description>
