	<detailed_description>GOAL : Conduct prospective randomize pilot clinical trial embed within care delivery system University California Medical Center ( UCSF MC ) . It intend evaluate efficacy decision support clinical reason artificial intelligence improve medication treatment management patient poorly control hypertension ( HTN ) . Its primary goal de-risk implementation subsequent randomize powered clinical efficacy trial . RECRUITMENT : patient uncontrolled HTN ( ≥10 mmHg BP national guideline goal ) UCSF MC Cardiology Clinic . STUDY : Three-arms study : ( ) optima4BP surveillance treatment recommendation support ( O4BP ) ; ( b ) usual care ( UC ) - usual care see need treat physician ; ( c ) enhance care ( EC ) - UC + raw remotely collect BP value send treat physician . All patient undergo least 2 in-office visit , baseline visit exit visit . All patient ask provide every 30 day follow information : ( ) adherence current HTN treatment ; ( b ) experience side-effects severity . Health-e-Heart ( HeH ) automate system ( https : //www.health-eheartstudy.org/ ) collect Qardio® data , frequently patient record , provide patient unique link secure web interface report side-effects , adherence , symptom . Every 30 day , collection patient information follow arm-specific action . For identified patient need medication change , O4BP physicians receive treatment change recommendation review . UC physicians receive information , EC physician receive curated BP value report patient . ANALYSES : The impact O4BP arm coordination care determine : - evaluate interoperability multiple platform collecting-structuring-exchanging data - evaluate improvement quality care ( physician adoption ) quality life ( patient adoption ) versus EC UC care .</detailed_description>
