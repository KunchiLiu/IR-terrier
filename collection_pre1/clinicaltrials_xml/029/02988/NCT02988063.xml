	<brief_summary>This study evaluate addition polidocanol endovenous microfoam ( PEM ) compression therapy determine effectiveness improve heal venous leg ulcer ( VLUs ) adult severe venous disease great saphenous vein ( GSV ) . All participant receive treatment Varithena compression therapy . The purpose study ass whether use PEM correct superficial axial varicose vein reflux effective improve heal VLUs , treatment compression alone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect PEM Treatment Superficial Axial Tributary Vein Reflux Improvement Wound Healing VLUs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Compression therapy polidocanol endovenous microfoam ( PEM ) use treatment venous leg ulcer ( VLUs ) , different mechanism . Compression therapy apply wound care professional demonstrate improve heal rate patient exist VLUs reduce ulcer recurrence , use consistently treat physician . Compression therapy consist hosiery , tubular bandage bandage system comprise two component , provide graduate compression lower limb order improve venous return reduce edema . Polidocanol endovenous microfoam ( PEM ) injectable foam medication use treat symptom venous disease , include venous leg ulcer ( VLUs ) . The medication ( `` polidocanol '' ) foam ( `` endovenous microfoam '' ) . PEM inject catheter direct injection malfunction vein . The foam fill treat desire section vein , thereby collapse diseased vein . When malfunction vein collapse , microfoam deactivate blood flow shift healthier vein nearby .</detailed_description>
