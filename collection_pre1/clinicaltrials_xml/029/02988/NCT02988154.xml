	<detailed_description>This study aim investigate efficacy simulation neurosurgical training . This assess use accuracy speed test placement external ventricle drain catheter ( EVDs ) . EVD placement relatively simple neurosurgical procedure aim inexperienced young trainee . This study two arm . The recruit inexperienced trainee and/or interns student never perform EVD placement . The recruit randomly assign ( use computer-based randomisation ) either Arm A Arm B . Recruits Arm A undergo simulation training ( computer simulation procedure , follow simulation dead animal model ) , recruit attempt perform EVD procedure , 3D-printed skull model design . Recruits Arm B witness EVD placement perform experienced surgeon , recruit attempt perform EVD procedure , use aforementioned 3D-printed skull model . This mimic `` see one , one '' paradigm prevalent surgical training . The efficacy simulation training assess use follow criterion : . Accuracy test : The accuracy catheter placement assess arm compare investigate whether difference accuracy catheter placement arm . ii . Speed test : The speed catheter placement assess arm compare investigate whether difference speed catheter placement arm . iii . Subjective survey The researcher gauge extent trainee ' confidence surgical skill satisfaction training completion simulation train use questionnaire design purpose . The trainee assess familiarity confidence procedure use scale 0 ( `` familiar procedure '' , `` I confidence able perform procedure independently '' ) 10 ( `` I expert procedure '' , `` I able perform procedure independently complete confidence '' ) . This data collect input statistical software ( Statistical Lab v. 3 , CeDiS ) analyse difference ( ) trainee ' familiarity procedure confidence able perform arm .</detailed_description>
