	<brief_summary>Hypertension one important preventable contributor disease death United States represent common condition see primary care set . Approximately 78 million adult live U.S. hypertension 5 million new diagnosis make year . Unfortunately , despite significant impulse medical community move towards `` individualized medicine '' approach patient center treatment , current clinical treatment strategy base set algorithm take account individual patient difference . As result hypertension often sub-optimally treat base `` population average '' , rather person 's genetic make-up , significant burden health care system . In fact , 40 % patient adherent blood pressure therapy ( take medicine prescribe clinician ) blood pressure control . Previous work demonstrate significant functional polymorphism within kidney , vessel , heart likely predict patient 's response blood pressure pharmacotherapy . Previous work group , utilize retrospective design , determine addition genetic knowledge prescribe improve therapeutic guidance decrease time blood pressure control significantly . Despite , date , prospective trial guide blood pressure therapy use multiple organ system important three common class drug : diuretic , vasodilator , beta-blockers . The objective clinical trial determine efficacy genetically guide therapeutic option pharmacologic treatment essential hypertension newly diagnose patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Investigating Use Genetics Guide Pharmacologic Therapy Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific Aim : To determine efficacy genetically guide therapeutic option pharmacologic treatment essential hypertension , compare conventional standard care ( JNC 8 guideline direct therapy ) . Hypothesis A : Patients randomize genetically guide blood pressure therapy significantly reduce time optimal blood pressure control compare conventional standard care . Hypotheses B : Patients randomize genetically guide blood pressure therapy significantly great absolute blood pressure reduction compare conventional standard care . Hypothesis C : Patients randomize genetically guide blood pressure therapy take few class blood pressure medicine order achieve blood pressure control . Secondary Aim : To determine genetically guide blood pressure therapy reduce number medication change patient hypertension . Hypotheses : Patients randomize genetically guide blood pressure therapy significantly less medication change .</detailed_description>
