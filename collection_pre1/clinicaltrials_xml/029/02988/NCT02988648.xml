	<brief_summary>The purpose phase I/II study evaluate safety clinical activity Radioiodide ( 131I- ) novel target therapy metastatic breast cancer overexpresses functional Na/I symporter . The study enroll patient metastatic breast cancer clinical and/or radiographic evidence disease progression prior hormonal and/or chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Clinical Trial Evaluating Safety Clinical Activity Radioiodide ( 131I- ) Novel Targeted Therapy Metastatic Breast Cancer That Overexpresses Functional Na/I Symporter</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective study follow : 1 . To evaluate feasibility use 124I- PET/CT scan identify patient whose metastatic lesion accumulate radioactive iodide therefore candidate 131I- therapy . 2 . Determine frequency iodide ( 124I ) enrich metastatic breast cancer . 3 . Evaluate safety clinical activity one-time 131I treatment patient screen positive 124I- PET/CT screening , positivity define calculated iodide enrichment allow deliver 2000 cGy radiation one metastatic lesion administer 200mCi 131I- . The secondary objective study follow : 1 . To investigate correlation NIS expression tumor tissue 124I- uptake screen PET/CT scan The Phase I portion follow 3+3 design 4 dose level ( 30 , 60 , 120 , 200 mCi ) I- treatment . The maximum tolerate dose use Phase II efficacy assessment follow Simon 's optimal two-stage design . The primary efficacy measure objective tumor response rate ( CR PR ) target activity level &gt; 20 % response rate . The study terminate futility tumor response see first 12 patient . If futility criterion meet , total 37 eligible patient enrol Phase II portion . If 4 response see 37 patient evaluate , investigator conclude regimen warrant study .</detailed_description>
