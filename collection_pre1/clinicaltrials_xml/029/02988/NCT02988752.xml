	<detailed_description>Glaucoma second major cause blindness world , lag behind cataract . However , unlike cataract , blindness cause glaucoma irreversible . Early diagnosis disease progression monitoring thus essential proper treatment order avoid irreversible blindness . The common screening exam glaucoma diagnosis monitoring eye fundus evaluation Cup-to-Disc ratio ( CDR ) among parameter assess . This kind evaluation perform ophthalmologist base visual perception , require specific training also significant amount time eye examination.Objective measurement CDR involve high cost equipment turn require specific train order use . Currently , Optical Coherence Tomography use gold standard CDR measurement . An OCT exam use high cost complex equipment time affordable low-income people . This study propose portable electronic device capture eye fundus image , analyzes image , performs CDR calculation allow store image analysis . This low cost portable device develop use several health service ( public private ) low energy consumption , ease mobility . Moreover , use device easy , require significant learn effort ophthalmologist . In develop country screen program early diagnosis glaucomatous neuropathy adopt , ever-growing number researcher put significant amount effort develop cost-benefit solution reach low-income people remote area . Objective : This study compare CDR measurement portable electronic device ( PED ) develop Centro de Informatica da Universidade Federal de Pernambuco CDR measurement provide OCT. Methods : This study non-inferiority trial mask data analysis . Individuals range 18 60 year gender meet pre-defined criterion include . This study carry Recife Clinica Oftalmologica Zona Sul Centro de Informatica-UFPE . Using equipment , 5 vertical cup-to-disc ratio ( VCDR ) evaluation perform eye individual , midriatic condition . Evaluations do examiner know previously result obtain equipment . Data collect main researcher research . This study approve ethic committee start research member sign TCLE agreement . The statistical test employ study Pearson Correlation test .</detailed_description>
