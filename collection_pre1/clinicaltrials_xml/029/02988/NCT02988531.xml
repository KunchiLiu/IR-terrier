	<detailed_description>Positron emission tomography ( PET ) method non-invasively image metabolic process . It use clinical medicine many year primary use identify area increase metabolic activity possible cancer . It involve use radionuclide ( radiotracer ) label chemical involve certain metabolic process . In order PET signal radiotracer detect scanner radionuclide emits small dose ionize radiation . Examples commonly use radionuclides include 18FDG 18 Sodium Fluoride ( 18NaF ) . In order locate exactly area abnormal increase metabolic activity , Computerised Tomography ( CT ) traditionally use anatomical correlation . Until recently PET-CT largely confine use oncology . More recently however PET-CT utilized detect vulnerable plaque coronary artery disease . In coronary artery disease 18F-fluoride act marker novel calcification activity within plaque . Similar condition , calcification coronary atheroma occur heal response intense necrotic inflammation , make 18F- fluoride useful marker high-risk atherosclerotic plaque . This demonstrate stable angina well localize culprit plaque myocardial infarction 90 % case . Magnetic resonance image increasingly adopt cardiovascular imaging hold particular attraction due ability provide information soft tissue structure without contrast agent , well safety due absence exposure ionise radiation rapid image speed , useful move organ like heart . PET-MR work differently PET-CT. PET rely annihilation proton electron , generate 511 keV photon , absorb bodily tissue differently depend electron density ( e.g . heart denser lung ) . Because PET image appear bright darker different tissue . To account , technique attenuation correction employ . This usually form call transmission scan ( low intensity CT scan ) grade tissue density corrects PET signal accordingly . Given MRI measure proton density electron density different attenuation correction technique need . It yet establish best despite multiple effort use differ technique . Previous single centre study demonstrate feasibility MRI-PET . The technique 's translation clinical practice limit due global lack reliable attenuation correction method . During recent Clinical Research Imaging Fellowship New York , co-investigator ( Dr Dweck ) develop novel free breathing method attenuation correction combine PET-MR scanner reduce scanning time improved efficiency show immense promise . In Edinburgh similar combine PET-MR scanner ( mMR , Siemens , Erlangen , Germany ) instal , yet replicate validated technique . If investigator demonstrate apply method attenuation correction acceptable show good comparability MRI-PET PET-CT image may able use image method alternative PET-CT. Benefits may translate clinically include superior soft tissue characterisation significantly reduce radiation dosage . The technique could apply across range medical condition addition cardiovascular disease oncology . The investigator hopeful establish suitable attenuation correction method PET-MR match even supersede PET-CT imaging technique provide accurate biological , anatomical functional information cardiovascular disease low radiation dos .</detailed_description>
