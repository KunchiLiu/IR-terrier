	<brief_summary>The study test hypothesis CMV TCR-transduced T cell , specific T-cell dose/kg , generate functional CMV immune response post-transplant , CMV-specific donor T cell isolate conventional mean . This test context adult HLA-matched sibling allogeneic HSCT . In proposed trial , HLA-A*0201-restricted CMV pp65-specific T cell receptor ( TCR ) introduce donor T cell via ex vivo GMP retroviral transduction . Donor T cell isolated peripheral blood follow simple venesection procedure . The CMV TCR-transduced T cell test TCR expression , CMV-specific cytokine secretion microbiological contamination frozen store -80C . CMV seropositive transplant recipient test weekly CMV reactivation quantitative PCR peripheral blood . On first detection CMV DNA &gt; 200 copies/ml , 104 ( cohort 1 ) 105 ( cohort 2 ) bulk CMV TCR-transduced T cells/kg recipient weight infuse patient . Blood take regularly determine persistence expansion CMV TCR-transduced T cell . Weekly CMV PCR continue . Patients examine appropriate interval ( daily inpatient , twice weekly BMT clinic outpatient ) development graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) potential side effect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Adoptive Immunotherapy With Donor-derived CMV-specific T Cells Recipients Allo-HSCT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Reactivation latent human herpes virus , Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) , post allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( Allo-HSCT ) result significant morbidity mortality unless treat promptly . Anti-viral therapy usually effective , serious side effect typically require prolong inpatient admission , myelosuppression ( Ganciclovir ) nephrotoxicity ( Foscarnet ) . Cellular immunotherapy CMV test Phase I/II trial UK Europe . In trial CMV-specific T cell isolated peripheral blood CMV seropositive donor re-infused recipient follow CMV reactivation result sustain anti-viral response . It clear post-transplant recovery CD8+ CMV-specific cytotoxic T-cells ( CTL ) abrogate development CMV-related disease . An advantage cellular therapy CMV reactivation transfer immunological memory , reduce number subsequent reactivations . This important , rapidly increase number highly immunosuppressive ( T cell deplete ) reduce intensity condition Allo-HSCTs perform UK . These approach reduce toxicity transplantation old patient co-morbidities . Reduced intensity allogeneic transplant currently part UK MRC AML15 trial recommend propose MRC/ECOG UKALL14 study UK MRC AML17 . In addition , number NCRN approve UK multicentre extend Phase II study recently start use reduce intensity Allo-HSCT various lymphoma subtypes . Transplant recipient CMV seronegative donor benefit currently available cellular immunotherapy approach due lack CMV-specific memory T cell donor . At present , reliable strategy isolate virus specific T cell uninfected naïve individual , precursor frequency low absent vitro prim T-cell response inefficient . T-cell receptor ( TCR ) gene transfer offer strategy produce antigen-specific T cell independent precursor frequency without need T-cell priming . As approximately 50 % adult individual previously infect CMV , significant number CMV 'mismatched ' Allo-HSCT perform , donor CMV seronegative recipient CMV seropositive . The propose study test feasibility generate donor-derived CMV-specific T cell via ex vivo introduction CMV-specific T cell receptor use GMP grade retroviral vector .</detailed_description>
