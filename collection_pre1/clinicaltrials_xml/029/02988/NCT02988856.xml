	<detailed_description>Two major type eye lid movement disorder include lagophthalmos ( incomplete closure eyelid ) blepharoptosis ( incomplete opening eyelid ) . Both condition occur disruption normal agonist-antagonist neuro-muscular complex balance . Generally paralysis eyelid facial muscle responsible abnormality ( eyelid close open , open close ) . An external device , able generate appropriately balance force , could restore eyelid movement perform paralyzed function ; example , ptotic ( droopy ) eyelid could open , function eyelid closure muscle could overcome device 's force . In prior work investigator establish proof-of-concept data demonstrate safety efficacy temporary management ptosis 2 hour per day 2 week . Preliminary data suggest similar safety lagophthalmos . This study expand preliminary work examine longer wear time , home use , feasibility wider range eye lid disorder .</detailed_description>
