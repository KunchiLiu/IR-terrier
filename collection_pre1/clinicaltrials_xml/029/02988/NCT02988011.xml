	<brief_summary>In explorative randomized clinical study , investigator aim study metabolic , cellular , molecular change occur weight loss obese subject without type 2 diabetes . Using novel `` imiomics '' ( image technique use PET/MR bioinformatics ) analyse examine possible metabolic difference energy restrict diet gastric by-pass surgery whole-body tissue specific insulin sensitivity , glucose tolerance , metabolite protein profile , fatty acid metabolism , ectopic fat content , gene expression adipose tissue . This study aim identify novel biomarkers drug target type 2 diabetes well validate promise establish biomarkers interventional model improve glucose metabolism .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Improving Glucose Lipid Metabolism Through Caloric Restriction Using Diet Surgery ( CRUDOS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>By use omics platform genomics , proteomics metabolomics large amount information metabolic change tissue whole body level . In parallel , clinical imaging modality Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) develop rapidly , allow whole-body study different tissue involve systemic disease . Furthermore , new hybrid system integrate PET-MRI provide combine information human morphology function . The integration PET MRI reduce radiation dose compare PET-CT acceptable level metabolic study . To handle large amount data examination currently develop image analysis concept , `` Imiomics '' , allow holistic analysis whole-body image data integration non-imaging data . In current study , plan use PET-MRI well imiomics methodology , together gold standard methodology assess insulin sensitivity glucose tolerance vivo . We aim conduct randomize study ( CRUDOS study ; Caloric Restriction Using Diet Or Surgery ) study glycometabolic effect gastric bypass surgery low-calorie diet subject different stage glucose tolerance ( i.e . obese subject without T2D ) .</detailed_description>
