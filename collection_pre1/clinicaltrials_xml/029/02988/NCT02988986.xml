	<brief_title>TAK-228 Plus Tamoxifen Patients With ER-Positive , HER2-negative Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The mTOR pathway commonly dysregulated ER-positive breast cancer represent key resistance mechanism endocrine therapy tamoxifen . We plan target mTOR pathway mTORC1/2 inhibitor TAK-228 overcome tamoxifen resistance early-stage ER-positive breast cancer . An open label phase II clinical trial conduct determine efficacy , toxicity , safety TAK-228 plus tamoxifen patient newly diagnose ER-positive , HER2-negative breast cancer . TAK-228 ( 30 mg weekly ) plus tamoxifen ( 20 mg daily ) administer 16 week . Patients undergo tumor biopsy start study treatment 6 week study treatment . Blood sample pharmacokinetics analysis obtain 1 hour TAK-228 dosing day 1 15 study .</detailed_description>
