	<brief_summary>Sport concussion among commonly occur injury sport recreation pose significant public health implication Canadians . Many individual sustain concussion recover initial 7-10 day 74 % youth 31 % adult may suffer persistent symptom . Little research currently available evaluate effect treatment individual slower recover follow sport-related concussion . An initial RCT identify significant treatment effect individual persistent symptom dizziness , neck pain and/or headache follow sport-related concussion treat combination cervical vestibular physiotherapy compare typical protocol rest follow grade exertion ( Schneider et al , 2014 ) . Low level aerobic exercise combination sport specific training may also benefit facilitate recovery child youth follow concussion ( Gagnon et al , 2009 , 2016 ) . Further evaluation treatment require well understand effect treatment isolation combination . This trial ability inform future multifaceted clinical trial well clinical practice . Ultimately , identification optimal treatment paradigms lead decrease persistent symptom functional alteration child youth commonly occur injury .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Although awareness regard sport-related concussion growing , rehabilitative strategy commonly occur injury focus little research . With exception pilot RCT , RCTs date evaluate efficacy cervical spine physiotherapy combination vestibular rehabilitation sport-related concussion . Current evidence suggest positive effect low-level aerobic exercise youth adult slow recover follow concussion ( Gagnon et al , 2016 ) . However , low-level aerobic exercise yet compare cervicovestibular physiotherapy . A shift clinical practice ( implement cervicovestibular physiotherapy low level aerobic exercise ) occurring , direct comparison effect low level aerobic exercise multimodal physiotherapy treatment yet conduct . A combination two form treatment may beneficial either isolation . Thus , combination physiotherapy low level aerobic exercise treatment also require evaluation . Identification management strategy individual persistent symptom follow concussion urgently require inform practice optimize treatment strategy commonly occur health problem . OBJECTIVES : Primary Research Question : 1 . Does cervical vestibular rehabilitation ( CVPT ) 1 ) result great proportion individual medically clear return sport ( yes/no ) ; 2 ) improve quality life compare control group low level aerobic exercise ( LLAE ) ( follow 8-week intervention individual persistent symptom dizziness , neck pain and/or headache follow concussion ) ? Secondary Research Questions : 1 . Does combination CVPT LLAE 1 ) result great proportion individual medically clear return sport ; 2 ) Improve quality life compare CVPT LLAE alone ( follow 8-week intervention individual persistent symptom dizziness , neck pain and/or headache follow concussion ) ? Exploratory Research Questions : 1 . Does cervical vestibular rehabilitation ( CVPT ) result great proportion individual medically clear return sport compare control group low level aerobic exercise ( LLAE ) ( follow 8-week intervention individual persistent symptom dizziness , neck pain and/or headache follow concussion ) stratify subgroup base time since injury , previous history concussion , sex age ? 2 . Does combination CVPT LLAE result great proportion individual medically clear return sport compare CVPT LLAE alone stratify subgroup base time since injury , previous history concussion , sex age ? 3 . What clinical characteristic predict response treatment ? 4 . What change symptoms clinical measure cervical vestibular function occur treatment ? 5 . What change measure disability , self-efficacy , neuropsychological psychosocial function occur treatment ? 6 . What factor may affect treatment outcome ( i.e . medical clearance ) quality life youth persist symptom follow concussion ? METHODS : The study design single blind randomize control trial ( RCT ) . Participants recruit University Calgary Acute Sport Concussion Clinic community sport medicine office , family physician ally health City Calgary surround area . All participant undergo initial physiotherapy assessment inclusion study . This assessment repeat time medical clearance return sport ( le 8 week ) 8 week follow initiation treatment . Participants randomize cervicovestibular physiotherapy intervention ( CVPT ) group , low level aerobic exercise group ( LLAE ) , combination cervicovestibular physiotherapy low level aerobic exercise group ( combination ) . All study participant meet weekly ( 30 minute appointment ) study physiotherapist eight week ( time medical clearance return sport clearance occur prior 8 week ) . All group follow protocol grade exertion per 4th International Consensus Guidelines ( Zurich 2012 , McCrory et al , 2013 ) .</detailed_description>
