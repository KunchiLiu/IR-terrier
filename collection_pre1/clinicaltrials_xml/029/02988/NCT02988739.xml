	<brief_title>Comparison Laser Assisted Epidermal Intradermal Administration Seasonal Influenza Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The skin attractive tissue vaccination due impact cutaneous micro-environment adaptive non-adaptive immune response . Conventionally many vaccine administer subcutaneously . Immune-competent cell however resident subcutaneous fat tissue , instead locate epidermis dermis skin . Depending targeted skin layer administration method , different immunological outcome thus anticipate follow vaccination . In present study , immunogenicity ( term activation B-cell mediate T-cell mediate immune response ) laser-assisted epidermally administer seasonal influenza vaccine compare needle-based intradermal administration seasonal influenza vaccine .</detailed_description>
