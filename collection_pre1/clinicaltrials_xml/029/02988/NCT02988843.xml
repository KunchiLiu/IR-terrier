	<criteria>Male , ≥ 18 year age Diagnosis CD30 positive germ cell tumor . CD30 expression test immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) archival fresh tumor tissue routinely do diagnosis . Disease progression image tumor marker progression ( clinical significance tumor marker progression decide per discretion treat physician ) least 2 line platinumbased chemotherapy unless patient ineligible platinum base chemotherapy refuse 2nd line platinum base chemotherapy due toxicity . For primary mediastinal germ cell tumor , failure firstline chemotherapy accept . Prior high dose chemotherapy hematopoietic stem cell rescue allow . Prior treatment bevacizumab allow . At least 3 week elapse since last treatment ( e.g . chemotherapy , target small molecule therapy , immunotherapy radiation ) must recover grade 1 good acute effect prior therapy . Presence measurable disease accord RECIST 1.1 ECOG performance status 0 1 Adequate marrow organ function within 28 day prior study registration define : Leukocytes &gt; 3,000/µL ANC &gt; 1500/µL Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL , Note : Blood transfusion allow patient hemoglobin &lt; 9 g/dl GCSF allow neutropenic patient time enrollment . Platelets &gt; 100,000/mm3 Creatinine : ≤3mg/dl OR serum creatinine &gt; 3 mg/dl , estimate GFR &gt; 30 mL/min/1.73m2 INR : &lt; 1.5 x institutional upper limit normal OR &lt; 3 warfarin anticoagulant . There evidence active bleeding anticoagulant . Total bilirubin : ≤ 2 x institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) SGOT ( AST ) SGPT ( ALT ) : &lt; 3 x institutional upper limit normal ( &lt; 5 x ULN liver metastasis present ) Proteinuria : If urine dipstick show 2+ protein , 24 hour urinary protein do less ≤ 2 grams/24 hour . Sexually active men partner woman childbearing potential must agree practice effective method contraception study 6 month last treatment Provide voluntary write consent HIPAA authorization release personal health information , approve Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee ( IRB/IEC ) Prior treatment Brentuximab Vedotin . Known active brain metastasis carcinomatous meningitis . Subjects previously treat brain metastasis may participate provide brain metastasis stable ( without evidence progression image least four week prior first dose trial treatment neurologic symptom return baseline ) , evidence new enlarge brain metastasis , use steroid least 7 day prior study registration . This exception include carcinomatous meningitis , exclude regardless clinical stability . History blood clot , pulmonary embolism , deep vein thrombosis previous 6 month unless control anticoagulant treatment Known history HIV Known active Hepatitis B ( e.g. , HBsAg reactive ) Hepatitis C ( e.g. , HCV RNA [ qualitative ] detect ) Received live vaccine within 1 week prior first dose study treatment Has active autoimmune disease require systemic treatment use disease modify agent , corticosteroid immunosuppressive drug Any clinically significant active infection require systemic treatment time enrollment . Known allergy bevacizumab brentuximab vedotin excipients Patients congestive heart failure ( NYHA Class III IV ) , unstable angina , sustain ventricular tachycardia , ventricular fibrillation , clinically significant bradycardia , advanced heart block history acute myocardial infarction ( MI ) within 6 month study registration History abdominal fistula , gastrointestinal perforation , intraabdominal abscess previous 6 month Prior major surgery within previous 28 day study registration and/or presence nonhealing wound , fracture , ulcer . Use investigational agent within previous 28 day study registration . Poorly control hypertension [ define systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) ≥150 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) ≥ 90mmHg ] . Note : Initiation adjustment antihypertensive medication ( ) permit prior study registration Arterial thromboembolic event , include transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) , cerebrovascular accident ( CVA ) , unstable angina , MI within 6 month study registration History posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome Other malignancy unless patient consider diseasefree complete therapy malignancy &gt; 6 month prior study entry</criteria>
