	<criteria>Male Female Subjects meeting follow inclusion criterion include study : 1 . Subjects age ≥12 year 2 . Clinically confirm diagnosis diabetes mellitus ≥1 year 3 . Subject sign informed consent form willing comply protocol requirement Subjects meet follow exclusion criterion time screen exclude study : 1 . Female subject childbearing capacity ( define surgically sterile menopausal ≥ 1 year ) lactating pregnant , intend become pregnant , practice birth control course study . 2 . A condition prevent complicate placement , operation , removal Sensor wearing transmitter , include upper extremity deformity skin condition . 3 . Symptomatic coronary artery disease ; unstable angina ; myocardial infarction , transient ischemic attack stroke past 6 month ; uncontrolled hypertension ( systolic &gt; 160 mm Hg diastolic &gt; 100 mm Hg time screen ) ; current congestive heart failure ; history cardiac arrhythmia ( benign PACs PVCs allow ) . Subjects asymptomatic coronary artery disease ( e , g , CABG , stent placement angioplasty ) may participate negative stress test within 1 year prior screen write clearance Cardiologist document . 4 . History hepatitis B , hepatitis C , HIV 5 . Currently receive ( likely need study period ) : immunosuppressant therapy ; chemotherapy ; anticoagulant/antithrombotic therapy ( exclude aspirin ) ; glucocorticoid ( exclude ophthalmic nasal ) . This exclusion include use inhaled glucocorticoid use topical glucocorticoid ( sensor site ) ; antibiotic chronic infection ( e.g . osteomyelitis , endocarditis ) 6 . A condition require likely require magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) 7 . Known topical local anesthetic allergy 8 . Known allergy glucocorticoid 9 . Any condition investigator 's opinion would make subject unable complete study would make subject 's best interest participate study . Conditions include limited psychiatric condition , know current recent alcohol abuse drug abuse subject history , condition may increase risk induced hypoglycemia risk relate repeat blood testing . Investigator supply rationale exclusion 10 . Participation another clinical investigation ( drug device ) within 2 week prior screen intent participate study period 11 . The presence active implanted device ( define protocol ) 12 . The presence CGM sensor transmitter locate upper arm ( location acceptable )</criteria>
