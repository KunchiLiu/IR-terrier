	<detailed_description>A diet meal high dietary protein report promote satiety suppress food intake human several previous study . It suggest presence amino acid blood result high protein intake serve signal suppress appetite human . More recently , observe incomplete low quality protein , i.e . miss one essential amino acid , may suppress hunger complete protein , ingestion incomplete protein long term may lead deficiency essential amino acid . Plant proteins generally consider incomplete protein compare animal protein , mean plant protein may higher appetite-suppressing effect . Dietary carbohydrates potent stimulus insulin secretion . However , addition dietary protein carbohydrate-rich meal show stimulate insulin release.The insulinotropic effect dietary protein think attribute branched-chain amino acid ( BCAA ) content protein-rich meal . Interestingly , hierarchy effect induce protein different source . For example , milk protein show superior fish plant protein stimulate insulin secretion follow meal.Even within milk protein , whey protein stimulate insulin secretion casein protein . One factor distinguish whey casein protein digestibility digestion rate protein . Protein digest faster appear increase blood amino acid level faster , increase insulin release faster.This implies plant protein low digestibility rate relative animal protein may lower insulinotropic effect , effective dose require achieve optimal insulin secretion may different animal protein warrant investigation . In addition , amino acid profile ( addition lower digestibility ) plant protein may differ animal protein , especially BCAA content associate stimulation insulin secretion . Dietary pattern cuisine vary country culture . Unlike Western country , plant-based food commonly consume Asian cuisine . Based statistic release Food Agriculture Organization , cereal meat top two protein source Western ( 29.1 % 26.4 % respectively ) Asian ( 58.8 % 8.6 % respectively ) country . The third major source protein dairy ( 16.7 % ) Western country , pulse Asia ( 7.4 % ) . In addition , vegetarianism widely practice Asian country . Studies investigate appetitive blood glucose regulate effect dietary protein focus predominantly animal protein , number study include plant-based protein soy protein . Since cereal pulse important part Asian cuisine , important understand compare effect proteins source blood glucose appetite regulation . Since amino acid profile digestibility plant-based protein differ animal protein , important also understand effective dose exerts optimal effect .</detailed_description>
