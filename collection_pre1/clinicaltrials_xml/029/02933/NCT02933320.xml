	<brief_title>BI-1206 Anti-CD20 Antibody Patients With CD32b Positive B-cell Lymphoma Leukaemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The molecule CD32b think present many B-cells include malignant B-cells type lymphoma leukaemia . The study drug , BI-1206 , anti-CD32b monoclonal antibody attache CD32b surface B-cells thought act recruit host immune cell toward tumour lead cancer cell death well enhance anti-cancer effect anti-CD20 antibody rituximab stop absorb cell . The study first man clinical trial drug call BI-1206 also combination anti-CD20 antibody ( rituximab ) commonly use treat lymphoma type leukaemia . The four main aim trial find : - The maximum dose BI-1206 give safely patient ( maximum dose 800mg ) 's combination anti-CD20 antibody , rituximab . - More potential side effect BI-1206 manage . - What happen BI-1206 inside body . - The effect BI-1206 treatment ( without rituximab ) tumour size survival . Approximately 81 patient relapsed refractory CD32b positive B-cell lymphoma leukaemia enter study . This include approximately 19 recruit BI-1206 dose escalation phase ( Part A ) , 12 ( likely 6 ) combination dose escalation 50 patient recruit two dose expansion cohorts; one BI-1206 alone one BI-1206 plus rituximab ( Part B ) . The final number depend number dose escalation require reach MTD .</detailed_description>
