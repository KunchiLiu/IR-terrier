	<brief_title>CSC OnDemand : An Innovative Online Learning Platform Implementing Coordinated Specialty Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Building exist resource expertise faculty advisor , develop CSC OnDemand , multifaceted online learning product include four level : 1 ) online readiness tool CSC Learning Hub ; 2 ) dynamic multimedia core curriculum first episode psychosis CSC ; 3 ) live faculty-led online course ; 4 ) ongoing support , include online community practice support peer-to-peer learning . During Phases I II Fast Track SBIR , prototype , pilot test , build , evaluate product cluster randomize non-inferiority study compare InPerson training . Phase I build robust prototype online platform test 15-20 provider three site . This Phase explore feasibility , acceptability , preliminary effectiveness product , examine component online platform provider find useful . Based finding Phase I , refine fully build product test large randomize trial . Phase II use cluster randomize non-inferiority design ass OnDemand training ( n = 20 site ) comparable InPerson training ( n = 10 site ) . Using mixed-methods approach , examine provider ( n = 150 ) outcome ( satisfaction ; knowledge gains/retention ; attitude toward share decision make ) client ( n = 600 ) outcome ( work/school participation ; engagement CSC service ; inpatient psychiatric hospitalization ) . The study guide follow specific aim : Phase I AIM 1 : To develop prototype version CSC OnDemand . AIM 2 : To test prototype online platform small sample sites/providers determine feasibility , acceptability , preliminary effectiveness product . Hypothesis : CSC OnDemand show positive learning satisfaction outcome among provider , finding suggest need feasibility conduct Phase II effectiveness trial . Phase II AIM 1 : To refine , expand , finalize CSC OnDemand base Phase I find . AIM 2 : To determine OnDemand train intervention successful InPerson intervention increase CSC provider knowledge share decision making ( SDM ) . Hypothesis : Providers OnDemand condition achieve increase knowledge , SDM satisfaction post train nine month .5 standard deviation less InPerson condition . AIM 3 : To determine OnDemand train intervention successful InPerson training increase participation work school , improve engagement treatment , decrease relapse rate participate client . Hypothesis : Clients serve provider OnDemand condition work/school participation rate , level engagement rate hospitalization nine month admission 10 percent high ( hospitalization ) low ( work/school , engagement ) client serve provider InPerson condition .</detailed_description>
