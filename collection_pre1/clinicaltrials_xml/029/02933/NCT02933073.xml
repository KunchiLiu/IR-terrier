	<brief_summary>This phase I trial test safety feasibility OncoImmunome vaccine stage III/IV ovarian cancer patient . OncoImmunome tumor specific vaccine formulation predict elicit tumor-protective immune response . A total 15 patient enrol Principal Investigator ( PI ) clinical practice . These patient successfully complete standard care surgical debulking , chemotherapy treatment clinical remission prior receive vaccine . The patient receive 6-monthly dos vaccine monitor 5 year post vaccination . This personalized vaccine , unique patient `` first human '' use .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Oncoimmunome Treatment Stage III/IV Ovarian Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study conduct IRB approval , accordance FDA regulation Human Subject Protection regulation . Female patient suspect FIGO Stage III/IV epithelial adenocarcinoma ovarian , tubal peritoneal origin screen enrolled initial clinic visit . Patients undergo standard care therapy include exploratory laparotomy debulking surgery follow chemotherapy . Only histologically confirm Stage III/IV epithelial ovarian/tubal/peritoneal carcinoma continue study . At time initial standard therapy , portion surgically resect tumor well normal cell obtain peripheral blood shall use extraction RNA DNA ; sample shall use sequence tumor normal transcriptomes , well normal exam sequencing , Genomic Core Facility UConn Health . Patient 's blood cell shall also HLA type . Following completion standard chemotherapy ( 6-8 cycle every 3 week ) Investigator 's confirmation clinical remission , patient consent subject experimental investigative portion study . The overall purpose research study produce test safety new experimental vaccine call OncoImmunome people Stage III/IV Ovarian Cancer . An `` experimental vaccine '' vaccine test approved sale United States U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . The study divide two part : 1 ) Tumor Tissue Blood Sample Collection 2 ) Vaccine Follow-up . Study participant consent follow : 1 . Tumor Tissue Blood Sample Collection : The purpose part study collect participant ' blood tumor tissue test genetic mutation . These test result use manufacture study vaccine unique participant ovarian cancer . 2 . Vaccine Follow-up : The purpose part study test safety experimental drug ( vaccine ) call OncoImmunome , produce specifically participant . Subject participation research study last 5 year . The vaccine produce 6 month period , six month subject receive study vaccine ( 1 study vaccine dose per month 6 study vaccine dose total ) . However , researcher continue collect subject information 5 year time provide tumor sample blood research .</detailed_description>
