	<brief_title>A Randomised Feasibility Trial High Water Intake Polycystic Kidney Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease ( PKD ) affect 12.5 million people worldwide , account 7 % require renal replacement therapy . The hormone vasopressin drive cyst growth ultimately normal function kidney tissue replace compressed cyst life course . Half affect require dialysis age 55 year . Vasopressin blockade emerge viable strategy alter disease course . High water intake suppresses vasopressin , may therefore slow cyst growth consequent disease progression . However , evidence support high water intake PKD lacking , clear whether patient adhere sufficiently high water intake . DRINK single-centre prospective , open label , parallel group randomise control feasibility trial . The primary objective establish whether definitive large randomise trial compare high versus ad libitum water intake long-term disease progression deliverable . Fifty patient recruit Renal Genetics service Addenbrooke 's Hospital . Participants randomly allocate high water intake ( high ) ad libitum ( standard ) water intake group . For high intake group aim drink large enough volume water achieve maintain dilute urine ( urine osmolality &lt; 270 mOsmo/kg urine specific gravity ≤ 1.010 ) . Multiple method employ promote adherence include instruction education well self-monitoring urine specific gravity twice weekly participant record result via trial specific smartphone application .</detailed_description>
