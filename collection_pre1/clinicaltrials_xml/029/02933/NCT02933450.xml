	<brief_summary>The Investigator hypothesize single dose patiromer lower serum potassium level less 6hrs . Since dosage 30g/day period 4 week study least two multicenter randomize controlled trial , Investigator hypothesize single dose 25.2g patiromer well tolerated hyperkalemic patient Emergency Department setting . The FDA approve dosage 25.2g appropriate study research staff enroll patient moderate ( K great 6 mEq/L ) severe hyperkalemia , high dosage typically use population effective control .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This open label pilot study . Thirty patient ESRD qualify emergent dialysis basis serum potassium great 6mEq/L randomly assign , use random number generator block six , standard-of-care ( standard care ) patiromer group . Patients patiromer group give single dose 25.2g patiromer addition standard-of-care treatment randomization . Standard-of-care define intervention care provide clinical provider accord individual practice pattern hospital protocol . Each group 15 patient observed telemetry monitor 10 hour till hemodialysis unit become available treatment ( whichever come first ) . Blood draws electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) perform enrollment 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 10hrs thereafter . Serum analyze basic metabolic panel magnesium . Medications , include potassium lowering agent , administered period document . 1 . Informed consent obtain . 2 . Subject randomize . 3 . A. Randomized Standard Care ( SOC ) : data collect SOC treatment . 3 . B. Randomized patiromer group : subject receive single dose 25.2g patiromer . SOC data collect . 4. subject blood drawn ECGs ( 1 12 lead ECG 1 Lead I Rhythm strip ) do baseline , 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 10 hour . Blood analyze basic metabolic panel magnesium . 5 . CRF completion-SOC data record addition current medication . 6 . After subject receive hemodialysis reach 10 hour study period , whichever come first , subject complete study .</detailed_description>
