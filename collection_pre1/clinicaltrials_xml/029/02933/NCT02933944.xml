Adequate contraception define study medically recommend method ( combination method ) per standard care . An adequate contraception include hormonal contraception implant combine oral , transdermal injectable contraceptive , certain intrauterine device , bilateral tubal ligation , hysterectomy , vasectomy partner . A combination male condom either cap , diaphragm sponge spermicide also consider acceptable . For woman childbearing potential negative pregnancy test need confirm inclusion . The patient fully inform study willing participate study , provide write informed consent form prior trial specific screening procedure . The patient previously receive anticancer vaccine immune checkpoint inhibitor , participate trial involve use anticancer vaccine immune checkpoint inhibitor Patients presurgery radiotherapy without chemotherapy , anticancer treatment include chemotherapy localise radiation severe pain indicated plan less 2 week screen The patient receive anticancer therapy concurrent illness The patient prior different malignancy within last 3 year ( exclude adequately treat basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin cancer , localise low grade tumour consider cure require systemic therapy ) The patient uncontrolled significant intercurrent recent illness include : autoimmune disorder history autoimmune disease require immunosuppressive treatment . cardiac disorder uncontrolled cardiac failure , unstable angina nonST segment elevation myocardial infarction ( NSTEMI ) myocardial infarction , uncontrolled arrhythmia le 3 month screen stroke thromboembolic event within 3 month study commencement active uncontrolled severe infection history solid organ transplantation condition require chronic treatment corticosteroid immunosuppressive agent active coagulopathy/bleeding diathesis cirrhosis , chronic active untreated persistent hepatitis history adverse reaction peptide vaccine The patient pregnant lactating .
