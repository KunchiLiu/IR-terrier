	<brief_summary>Background : The immune system cell organs body recognize fight infection cancer . The PROSTVAC vaccine might teach immune system find kill certain prostate cancer cell . Nivolumab ipilimumab drug allow immune system fight tumor . They might help PROSTVAC work well . Objective : To test safety effectiveness combination PROSTVAC , nivolumab , ipilimumab . To test people castrate resistant prostate cancer people prostate cancer . Eligibility : Men age 18 old prostate cancer Design : Participants screen : - Medical history - Physical exam - Blood urine test - Electrocardiogram - Bone scan - CT scan MRI - Tumor sample . This may previous procedure . All participant get combination study drug 8 week . They 1 visit initial injection 3 booster injection visit . Blood test visit . Over next 4 week , participant : - An exam large intestine rectum . - CT bone scan - Standard hormonal treatment - Option continue treatment every 3 week disease get bad . They scan every 12 week . Other participant surgery remove prostate week 9 . Participants safety visit month last treatment . This include physical exam , blood test , possibly scan . If cancer progress , participant leave study may enroll long-term follow-up study . They contact year ask cancer treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - Immune checkpoint inhibitor interfere immune system autoregulatory mechanism , allow potentially expand prolonged T-cell response possibility great antitumor effect . - Ipilimumab , fully human anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody , first-in-class immune checkpoint inhibitor . CTLA-4 express cytotoxic T lymphocyte ( CTLs ) activation APCs . - Nivolumab fully human IgG4 monoclonal antibody target PD-1 protein . Specifically , antibody bind PD-1 receptor block interaction PD-L1 PD-L2 , thereby release PD-1 pathway-mediated inhibition immune response , include anti-tumor immune response . - PROSTVAC ( developed National Cancer Institute [ NCI ] license Bavarian Nordic Immunotherapeutics , Mountain View , CA ) therapeutic cancer vaccine prostate cancer . Early study demonstrate immunologic efficacy suggest clinical benefit . A phase III trial complete accrual . - A previous study combine immune checkpoint inhibitor ipilimumab PROSTVAC suggest great efficacy PROSTVAC alone . Additional study demonstrate potential efficacy ipilimumab second immune checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab . - This study aim evaluate impact immunologic combination tumor microenvironment focus immune cell infiltration primary endpoint . - US-MRI imaging technology employ sample tumor treatment radical prostatectomy . - The finding study could serve basis future study combination population patient advanced disease . Objectives : -Safety ( For castration resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) lead-in cohort ) Evaluate change T-cell infiltration tumor neoadjuvant treatment PROSTVAC ipilimumab , PROSTVAC nivolumab , relative change see PROSTVAC , ipilimumab nivolumab ( For cohort ) . Eligibility : - Patients must histopathological documentation adenocarcinoma prostate prior start study evaluable biopsy tissue ( e.g. , unstained slide block ) available analysis . - For castration resistant lead cohort , histopathological documentation unavailable , rise PSA clinical course consistent prostate cancer would acceptable . - Patients must performance status 0 1 accord ECOG criterion . - Hematological eligibility parameter ( within 16 day start therapy ) : - Granulocyte count 1,500/mm^3 - Platelet count 100,000/mm^3 - Hgb great equal 8 g/dL - Biochemical eligibility parameter ( within 16 day start therapy ) : - Hepatic function : Bilirubin &lt; 1.5 mg/dl ( OR patient Gilbert syndrome , total bilirubin less equal 3.0 mg/dL ) , AST ALT less equal 2.5 time upper limit normal . - Creatinine less equal 1.5 X ULN Design : - The primary focus study evaluate PROSTVAC , ipilimumab nivolumab neoadjuvant setting . - Lead-in cohort evaluate safety tolerability combination castration resistant setting ( CRPC cohort ) - This cohort undergo sigmoidoscopy 9 week evaluate rectal inflammation colitis may pose problem men neoadjuvant cohort undergo radical prostatectomy ( do 9 week study ) . - Following lead-in cohort CRPC setting , enroll three sequential cohort neoadjuvant setting . - The first cohort evaluate combination PROSTVAC nivolumab . The second cohort evaluate combination PROSTVAC ipilimumab . The final cohort evaluate combination three . - The lead-in safety cohort require 10 patient Cohorts A C require 48 evaluable patient . In order allow small number inevaluable patient , accrual ceiling set 65 patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : For cohort except CRPC lead cohort , patient must histopathological documentation adenocarcinoma prostate prior start study evaluable biopsy tissue ( e.g. , unstained slide block ) available analysis . If evaluable tissue available , patient must agree undergo prevaccination prostate biopsy study . For CRPC lead cohort , histopathological documentation unavailable , rise PSA clinical course consistent prostate cancer would acceptable . Age great equal 18 year . Because dose adverse event data currently available use PROSTVAC combination nivolumab , ipilimumab patient &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study , eligible future pediatric trial . ECOG performance status 0 1 . Patients must active invasive malignancy within past 2 year ( exception nonmelanoma skin cancer ) ( CRPC cohort ) . Patients must willing travel study site followup visit All patient receive prior vaccination vaccinia virus ( smallpox immunization ) must history adverse reaction vaccine . The effect PROSTVAC combination nivolumab , ipilimumab develop human fetus unknown . For reason men must agree use adequate contraception ( abstinence , vasectomy ) female partner must use ( intrauterine device ( IUD ) , hormonal [ birth control , pill , injection , implant ] , tubal ligation ] prior study entry 5 month last dose . Patients must understand sign inform consent explain neoplastic nature disease , procedures follow , experimental nature treatment , alternative treatment , potential risk toxicity , voluntary nature participation . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : hemoglobin great equal 8 g/dL granulocyte great equal 1,500/mcL platelet great equal 100,000/mcL total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 mg/dL ( less equal 3.0 mg/dL patient Gilbert syndrome ) AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) less equal 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal creatinine less equal 1.5 X ULN For lead cohort : Castrate testosterone level ( &lt; 50ng/dl 1.7nmol /L ) Progressive disease study entry define one follow criterion occur set castrate level testosterone : Radiographic progression define new enlarge bone lesion grow lymph node disease , consistent prostate cancer OR PSA progression define sequence rise value separate &gt; 1 week ( 2 separate increase value minimum 2ng/ml ( PCWG2 PSA eligibility criterion ) . If patient flutamide , PSA progression document 4 week withdrawal . For patient bicalutamide nilutamide disease progression document 6 week withdrawal .
