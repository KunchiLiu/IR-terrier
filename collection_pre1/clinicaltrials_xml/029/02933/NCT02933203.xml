	<brief_summary>The purpose study examine whether stress predicts telomere length individual hold executive-level position . Telomeres caps end strand DNA may affect cell age . Subjects complete online survey/interview provide one blood sample saliva sample . The goal understand whether stress predicts genetic marker longevity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genetic Biomarkers Executive Stress</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary aim study evaluate relationship overall level stress telomere length . It hypothesize high stress group ( base Perceived Stress Scale ) compare low stress group shorter telomere length . A secondary aim evaluate whether different type stress differ degree association telomere length . An exploratory aim ass gender difference association stress telomere length . The investigator collect number measure , include demographic , work sector , perceive social support , medical history , order adjust potential confounders analysis . This study extension earlier work Dr. Rasgon do Dr. Elizabeth Blackburn UCSF relationship telomere length mood outcome . The investigator hope study add grow body literature stress genetic marker longevity , specifically stress level type associate telomere length . The increase understanding gain study may provide lead predict age-related disease early mortality adult , thus benefit others future .</detailed_description>
