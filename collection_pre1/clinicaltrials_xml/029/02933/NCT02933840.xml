	<brief_title>Using Remote Patient Monitoring Alert System Improve Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Geriatric orthopedic trauma patient particularly vulnerable cohort due age medical complexity . These patient often admitted floor unit high physician-to-patient nurse-to-patient ratio , especially hour low staff intensity ( eg , nighttime weekend hour ) . As result , hour low staff intensity potential acute deterioration delay reaction care team significant . The investigator aim test efficacy remote patient monitoring platform reduce adverse event population hour low staff intensity . The platform software call AlertWatch . It take laboratory vital sign data report medical record determine whether meet cut-off value concern patient deterioration . If value meet cut-off , send page recipient clinician . The investigator physician train intensive care receive alert respond evaluate patient , consultative capacity , assist primary team , namely orthopedic surgery service , take care patient . Patients randomized intervention control arm outset hospitalization . Patients intervention arm receive standard care monitor primary team responsible care patient remain orthopedic surgery service , however , addition , AlertWatch software implement intensive care physician involve patient 's care alert . Patients control arm receive standard care monitor orthopedic surgery service primary team responsible . The Investigators measure whether intervention reduces adverse event study population compare control patient . All patient enrol consecutively time admission hospital . The AlertWatch platform ( 510 ( k ) FDA clearance K15335 ) ability automatically detect whether patient admit bed orthopedic surgery service meet inclusion criterion . The platform automatically randomize patient active arm control arm study . For patient randomize active arm , platform provide alert monitoring . The Investigators also enrol intensive care physician participate study . Physician participation optional . In advance start study , provide information regard study inform consent document . The AlertWatch platform ability send alert detects abnormality , particular trend , combination abnormality trend . In study , Investigators use specific threshold value alert abnormality concern trend patient data . When alert make , send in-house intensive care physician 's regular pager . The page display data . Orthopedic intern continue monitor patient data standard fashion . The Investigators institute protocol intensive care physician receiving alert AlertWatch nighttime weekend hour . The intensivist : 1 . ) view alert , 2 . ) determine whether subsequent action warrant . Subsequent action may include : 1 . ) review patient 's chart 2 . ) visit patient and/or his/her nurse 3 . ) page orthopedic surgery team discus patient 's situation . There extremely low risk patient 's safety would threaten either arm study . Patients assign intervention arm control arm receive standard care . Intervention arm patient additionally AlertWatch software relay alert designate provider . The software create new , previously non-existent data . It relay data already available viewable provider medical record patient . Given nature intervention study , likelihood adverse event due intervention extremely low .</detailed_description>
