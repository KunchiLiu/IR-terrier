	<brief_summary>Traumatic , debilitate anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL ) injuries occur 2 10-fold great rate female male athlete . Consequently , large population female endure significant pain , functional limitation , radiographic sign knee osteoarthritis ( OA ) within 12 20 year FOLLOWING injury . To reduce burden OA , The National Public Health Agenda Osteoarthritis recommend expand refine evidence-based prevention ACL injury . Specialized train target modifiable risk factor show statistical efficacy high-risk athlete ; however , clinically meaningful reduction risk achieve . A critical barrier limit successful training outcome requirement qualified instructor deliver personalize , intuitive , accessible feedback young athlete . Thus , key gap knowledge efficiently deliver objective , effective feedback train injury prevention . The investigator long-term goal reduce ACL injury subsequent sequela young female athlete . The overall objective proposal implement test innovative augment neuromuscular training ( aNMT ) techniques enhance sensorimotor learn reduce biomechanical risk factor ACL injury . The rationale underlies proposal , completion , investigator equip effectively deliver biofeedback decelerate trend increase ACL injury rate female athlete . This contribution significant reduction long-term sequel follow ACL injury young female .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>aNMT integrate biomechanical screen state-of-the-art augmented reality headset display real-time feedback map complex biomechanical variable onto simple visual feedback stimulus athletes `` control '' via movement . The central hypothesis aNMT biofeedback improve joint mechanic evidence-based measure collect realistic , sport-specific virtual reality scenario . Specifically , purpose investigation determine efficacy aNMT biofeedback improve high-risk landing mechanic laboratory task sport-specific scenario . Based investigator 's preliminary data , investigator hypothesize aNMT biofeedback produce great improvement localize joint mechanic compare neuromuscular training incorporates sham feedback drop vertical jump ( DVJ ) task . In secondary Aim , investigator hypothesize aNMT produce improve localized joint mechanic global injury risk technique sport-specific maneuver assess immersive virtual environment compare sham feedback . The expected outcomes support increase efficiency enhance efficacy feedback personalize targeted injury prevention training . The positive impact improvement injury risk mechanic potential reduce injury field play . A randomized , repeated-measures design use test two hypothesis Aim 1 : First , aNMT produce great improvement localize joint mechanic compare sham feedback group DVJ task ; second , base preliminary data investigator expect innovative aNMT lead graduate joint improvement reduce global injury risk mechanic exceed overall task transfer reduction high risk biomechanics follow 12 real-time biofeedback training session . Previously describe technique use measure biomechanical risk factor DVJ task perform begin end 6-week pre-competition training period . Athletes randomize one two group : 1 ) aNMT biofeedback ( 2 ) sham ( augmented reality glass stimulus provide exercise repetition count ) . Each athlete , well statistician , blind intervention . All athlete receive 12 training session 6-week period pre-competition season group longitudinal assessment biomechanical outcome measure capture biofeedback session . A subset 60 participant recruited test refine biofeedback stimulus . These participant come single study visit randomly allocate biofeedback sham biofeedback group . Some participant may receive cross-over assignment complete biofeedback sham feedback task . These study participant participate strength , virtual reality pre post-testing .</detailed_description>
