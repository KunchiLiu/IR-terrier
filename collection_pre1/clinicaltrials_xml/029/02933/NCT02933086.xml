	<brief_summary>The relevance study give feasibility ass effect intervention program base functionality trunk neuromuscular activity postural control pregnant woman low back pain . The main outcome compute electromyography measurement ass trunk neuromuscular activation pattern well force platform parameter determine postural control . Clinical symptom pain intensity , perception disability fear avoidance also compute . This first study compare two intervention method use main biological outcome relate trunk segment function .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Intervention Program Trunk Neuromuscular Pattern Postural Control Pregnant With Low Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For study , proposal 6-week intervention program carry lumbar stabilization exercise clinical orientation , 20 low back pregnant patient recruit convenience voluntary community . Before intervention , participantes evaluate : electromoyography three exercise , balance , clinical outcome pain , disability psychological factor . All baseline test evaluation perform blinded evaluator study intervention . Afterwards , participant randomize two group blind evaluator ( people enrol study ) : G1 : exercise lumbar stabilization ; G2 : conventional therapy . The intervention follow six week , 50 minute duration session therapy include measurement blood pressure , heart rate Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) session , perception exercise intensity monitor Borg Scale . Within proposal , exercise session twice week , last 40 minute , follow 10 minute theoretical orientation . The intervention follow CONSORT recommendation randomize controlled trial . The intervention start : G1 ( n=10 ) , perform therapy specific exercise lumbar stabilization include Swiss ball therapeutic resource ; G2 ( n=10 , control group ) perform conventional therapy include stretch low limbs trunk . The participant blind study due characteristic exercise often reflect improvement symptom . In case eventual loss , intention-to-treat method use analysis . After intervention , group invite come back laboratory proceed evaluation baseline ( trunk activation three exercise , balance , clinical outcome ) For analysis two-way ANOVA repeat measure perform compare effect intervention ( two group ) time ( baseline vs. end 6-weeks measurement ) effect interaction ( Groups x Times ) .</detailed_description>
