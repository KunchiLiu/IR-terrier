	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well abbreviate breast magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) digital tomosynthesis mammography work detect cancer woman dense breast . Abbreviated breast MRI low cost procedure radio wave powerful magnet link computer use create detailed picture breast less 10 minute . These picture show difference normal diseased tissue . Digital tomosynthesis mammography procedure use multiple x-rays picture breast produce 3-dimensional rendering entire breast . Combined screen abbreviate breast MRI digital tomosynthesis mammography may better method screen woman dense breast .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare rate detection invasive cancer abbreviate breast ( AB ) -magnetic resonance ( MR ) digital tomosynthesis mammography ( DBT ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare positive predictive value ( PPV ) biopsy , call back rate , short-term follow rate AB-MR DBT initial 1 year follow study . II . To estimate compare sensitivity specificity AB-MR DBT , use 1 year follow define reference standard . III . To compare patient-reported short-term quality life relate diagnostic test AB-MR DBT use Testing Morbidities Index . IV . To compare willingness return test AB-MRI versus ( v ) DBT within recommend screen interval explore factor associate willingness return screening . V. To compare tumor biology invasive cancer ductal carcinoma situ ( DCIS ) detect AB-MR DBT . VI . To estimate incident cancer rate 3 year follow year-1 AB-MR/DBT patient return standard screening . OUTLINE : Participants randomize 1 2 arm . ARM I ( DBT , AB-MR ) : Participants undergo DBT follow AB-MR 10 minute day baseline 1 year . ARM II ( AB-MR , DBT ) : Participants undergo AB-MR 10 minute follow DBT day baseline 1year . After completion study , patient follow yearly 3 year .</detailed_description>
