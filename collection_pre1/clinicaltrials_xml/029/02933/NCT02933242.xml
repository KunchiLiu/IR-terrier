	<brief_title>Stereotactic Ablative Body Radiotherapy ( SABR ) Oligometastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To assess quality life side effect participants 5 metastatic cancer lesion treat comprehensive oligometastatic SABR treatment program . Secondarily , investigator document disease free overall survival . Rationale : The oligometastatic state first define 1995 refers stage disease cancer spread beyond site origin , yet widely metastatic . In state limit metastatic disease , hypothesize eradication sit metastatic disease could result long-term survival , even cure , participant . Ablation metastatic deposit achieve several technique , include surgery , radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) , Stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy ( SABR ) , new radiotherapy technology delivers large , hypofractionated dos radiotherapy small tumor target , high rate local control . Clinical evidence support presence oligometastatic state controversial . However , emerge low quality evidence surgical SABR literature state may exist . In study 5200 participant lung metastasis underwent surgical resection , 5-year survival 36 % report participant achieve complete resection , much high would expect stage IV disease.3 Similarly , participant treat SABR 1-3 lung metastasis variety primary tumor , local control SABR 96 % 2-years , 2-year survival 39 % . Long-term survival demonstrate participant treated oligometastases surgery SABR several tumor site , include liver , brain , bone , adrenal metastasis . The risk metastases ablative treatment 60-80 % study . SABR also use salvage newly progressive site ( oligoprogression ) . Despite apparent achievement long-term survival ablative treatment oligometastatic disease , level evidence support treatment weak , often base single-arm study without appropriate control . Participants include report highly select , base good performance status slow pace tumor progression . It suggest long-term survival achieve treatment oligometastases result selection fit participant slow-growing tumor , rather result treatment intervention . Randomized trial therefore necessary establish utility ablative treatment oligometastatic disease , therefore BCCA oligometastatic SABR group , recommend participant consider randomized control offer SABR current trial . In circumstance , participant may comfortable approach , physicians clinical equipoise , therefore SABR oligometastatic disease may appropriate . BCCA decide give limited evidence SABR setting , offer trial . The main focus trial assess side effect quality life post SABR . This trial aim provide clear informed consent process , include limited evidence SABR trial , potential harm SABR , participant opt pursue SABR oligometastases . This non-randomized phase II trial participant receive experimental SABR sit metastatic disease . The investigator accrue 200 participant assess toxicity associate experimental treatment .</detailed_description>

This often best obtain presentation multidisciplinary tumour round . Not candidate surgical resection site : surgery sit recommend multidisciplinary team , unfit decline surgery . Not candidate clinical trial randomize SABR standard treatment ( e.g . SABRCOMET ) , physician participant uncomfortable option . Prior chemotherapy allow chemotherapy ( cytotoxic molecularly targeted agent ) 48 hour prior first fraction radiotherapy , radiotherapy , 48 hour last fraction . Certain chemotherapy agent may require long break prior SABR protocol dictate . Hormonal therapy SABR allow . The potential treating SABR radiation oncologist reserve right require multidisciplinary note document life expectancy , treatment option suitability SABR . Participants metastases previously treat may eligible SABR protocol : If previous treatment nonradiation mean ( e.g . prior resection , RFA microwave ablation ) , SABR may deliver residual/recurrent disease If previous treatment SABR , participant eligible unless new site previously treat If previous treatment conventional RT , SABR could consider deliver safely . In circumstance must present multidisciplinary setting approval . Serious medical comorbidities preclude radiotherapy Bone metastasis femoral bone risk pending fracture high Participants 13 brain metastasis disease elsewhere ( participant accrue treated stereotactic radiotherapy per result publish randomized trial ) Complete response firstline chemotherapy ( i.e . measurable target SABR ) Malignant pleural effusion Inability treat site active disease ablative intent Clinical radiological evidence spinal cord compression Dominant brain metastasis require surgical decompression Pregnant lactating woman</criteria>
