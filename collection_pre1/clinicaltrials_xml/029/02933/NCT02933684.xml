	<brief_summary>The propose project aim increase accessibility exposure therapy , evidence base treatment social anxiety disorder , adapt therapist-assisted computer-based program deliver self-guided manner iPad . A significant problem self-guided treatment deliver via computer compliance . The vast majority user complete treatment , achieve therapeutic benefit quickly possible essential . D-cycloserine drug find augment response therapist-guided exposure therapy anxiety disorder , never test self-guided exposure . This study use randomize , double-blind methodology compare D-cycloserine ( 50 mg ; DCS ) placebo combination self-guided virtual reality exposure therapy ( VRE ) deliver via iPad treat social anxiety disorder . The propose study test hypothesis patient receive DCS combination self-guided VRE show improvement receive placebo combination VRE . Outcome measure include self-reported symptom social anxiety , behavioral avoidance , diagnostic remission . Participants ( N=34 ) adult primary diagnosis social anxiety disorder . Participants complete structure diagnostic interview , standardize self-report measure social anxiety , behavioral avoidance task ( i.e. , give speech ) assess pre-treatment , post-treatment 3 month follow-up . Hierarchical linear regression chi-square analysis use test difference randomize DCS versus placebo follow outcome : post-treatment score self-reported social phobia symptom , willingness anxiety give speech post-treatment , diagnostic remission 3 month follow-up . The propose project combine technological advance translational research develop innovative accessible treatment social anxiety disorder . The pilot data generate study appeal variety funding agency , include National Institute Mental Health 's call exploratory clinical trial novel intervention mental illness , Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute 's call effectiveness study aim overcome barrier treatment , National Science Foundation 's call innovation-technology translation research .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>D-Cycloserine Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Social Anxiety Disorder ( social phobia ) common psychiatric disorder US . It negatively impact health-related quality life , educational economic achievement , lead attempted suicide many 21 % affected individual . A critical barrier progress reduce negative impact disorder 75-92 % sufferer receive treatment . Social phobia self-help program deliver via computer design increase access treatment effective . Compliance completion rate program , however , quite poor , greatly limit impact accessibility . Furthermore , self-help program social phobia directly administer critical component treatment - exposure therapy . The direct administration self-guided exposure therapy , use virtual reality innovation would increase accessibility impact computer deliver treatment . Exposure therapy base well-researched fear extinction learn paradigm , individual confront fear therapeutic manner learn fear outcome occur . Ressler et al 's groundbreaking translational research show D-cycolserine ( DCS ) , analogue D-alanine partial agonist NMDA receptor , facilitate process fear extinction . DCS different pharmacological agent use treat social phobia prescribe chronically ( daily ) period month year maintain therapeutic dose ; one pill DCS take immediately exposure therapy session . This work spark flurry research show DCS augments exposure therapy variety anxiety disorder ; people take DCS show benefit therapist-assisted exposure therapy quickly take placebo . Two randomized double-blind , placebo-controlled study social phobia conclude combination DCS therapist-assisted exposure therapy improve treatment response participant complete few exposure session . The ability DCS speed response exposure therapy especially valuable sufferer use self-guided treatment , generally compliant full exposure protocol . The combination DCS self-guided exposure therapy would increase access effective treatment . The use DCS self-guided exposure , however , never test . Specific Aims 1 . Adapt exist computer program deliver self-guided VRE social phobia via iPad , 2 . Test comparative efficacy DCS v placebo plus self-guided VRE . Hypothesis : Participants receive self-guided VRE plus DCS show less self-reported social anxiety less avoidance laboratory base behavioral test follow 5-week intervention receive self-guided VRE plus placebo . The investigator seek shift current clinical practice treatment social phobia people disorder receive exposure therapy . The investigator improve access evidence-based treatment social phobia delivery exposure via computer - modality capitalize fact people severe social phobia spend extensive hour computer ; exposure therapy come people social phobia `` . '' The investigator also first test delivery exposure therapy iPad . The study design improve approach exist research computer-delivered program social phobia test treatment affect real behavior - exist research rely exclusively self-report measure assessment diagnostic status . No study assess actual behavior - either lab real-world . This study improve scientific knowledge answer question whether DCS augments self-guided exposure therapy . The combination self-help program DCS address many obstacle treatment therapist-guided exposure therapy . For example , enough mental health provider train exposure therapy . Furthermore , social anxiety disorder characterize fear avoidance social situation , psychotherapy inherently social encounter . The effective combination DCS self-guided virtual reality exposure avenue treatment sufferer access computer prescribe physician . When propose aim achieve , innovative treatment exist - self-guided VRE deliver via computer . The investigator develop tested self-help program deliver via computer , minimal therapist support . The self-help program test small ( N=10 ) uncontrolled trial 8 session , result show decreases score standardize self-report measure social anxiety pre- post-treatment follow-up . Large effect size observe post-treatment ( = 1.22-1.53 ) follow-up ( = 1.41 - 2.39 ) . Using standardized measure software usability , participant describe program easy-to-use , include participant never use computer . Since study , program update new virtual environment , well shorten treatment . The propose project adapt exist program delivery via tablet collect data via computer . Finally , investigative team complete double-blind , placebo control trial test combination DCS v placebo combine therapist-guided VRE specific phobia . Thus , investigative team well-positioned complete specific aim adapt computer program delivers self-guided exposure therapy social phobia via tablet test follow hypothesis : Participants receive self-guided exposure therapy plus DCS show less self-reported social anxiety less avoidance laboratory base behavioral test follow 5-week intervention receive self-guided exposure therapy plus placebo .</detailed_description>
