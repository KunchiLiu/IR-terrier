	<brief_summary>Rationale : Monitoring patient ' vital sign do detect clinical deterioration . For , MEWS , score list comprise seven vital sign measure nursing staff , use . Although MEWS provide relevant data patient ' health status , interval measurement may capture early deterioration vital sign , especially night . As result , unsafe situation may occur period low oxygen saturation cardiac arrhythmia , know complicate postoperative course . Besides , way measure vital sign may stressful patient disturbs patient ' sleep . New technology ViSi Mobile HealthPatch allow remote continuous monitoring vital sign use wearable device transmit relevant data nurse clinician . With , investigator think clinical deterioration may detect early phase reduce nurse work load patient distress . Objective : investigate feasibility wearable device general ward . Study design : feasibility study . Study population : adult patient hospitalize internal medicine ward adult postoperative patient surgical ward . Intervention : patient intervention group randomize one two group . Patients group 1 wear ViSi Mobile ; patient group 2 wear HealthPatch . Wearable device wear least three day . Regular MEWS measurement take place usual time point . Main study parameters/endpoints : Evaluation patient care giver ( primary outcome measure ) , MEWS calculation , time alarm ( continuous data ) next regular MEWS measurement ( nurse ) , intervention nurse alarm , admission ICU , complication , side effect device , STAI score , PCS score document . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : Patients wear one device least three day . Devices uncomfortable heavy patch start itch . More measurement nurse take place indicate , example alarm . The participate patient fill STAI daily basis PCS last day hospitalization . Both questionnaire take minute complete . Patients could benefit early detection clinical deterioration early corrective intervention ICU admission .</brief_summary>
