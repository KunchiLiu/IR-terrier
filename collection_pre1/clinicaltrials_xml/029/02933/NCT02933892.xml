	<detailed_description>Cardiac catheterization medical procedure use diagnose treat heart condition . Approaching heart do different access site : via femoral artery ( transfemoral ) radial artery ( transradial ) . Transfemoral access ( TFA ) primary mode arterial access . Several clinical trial demonstrate benefit transradial transfemoral approach . The primary advantage transradial approach significant reduction access-site complication . Chronic Kidney Disease ( CKD ) serious condition associate premature mortality , decrease quality life , increase health-care expenditure . ) . It commonly find patient diabetes , hypertension , hyperlipidemia , coronary artery disease , combination risk factor . Coronary artery disease CKD often comorbid condition see cath lab . Cardiac catheterization mainstay diagnosis treatment coronary artery disease 58 % death CKD relate cardiovascular death . Patients CKD undergo cardiac catheterization risk contrast-induced nephropathy ( CIN ) due dye use procedure . The investigator conduct randomize controlled trial aim compare incidence CIN transradial transfemoral cardiac catheterization .</detailed_description>
