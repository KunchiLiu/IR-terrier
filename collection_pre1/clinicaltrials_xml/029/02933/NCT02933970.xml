	<detailed_description>The study conduct non-blinded stepped wedge cluster randomize control trial two arm : onsite HCV management telemedicine versus HCV management usual care , case referral offsite liver specialist ( Referral ) . The arm assignment cluster ( clinic ) level . After initial period ( 6 month ) clinic implement control intervention ( usual care ) , regular interval ( i.e. , `` step '' ) 6 month duration , one group clinic randomize cross Usual Care arm Telemedicine arm . In way , enough time implementation assessment intervention within time period . The process continue clinic cross implement telemedicine , thus clinic contribute data intervention . In addition , patient follow two year post-treatment cessation ass reinfection relapse HCV RNA .</detailed_description>
