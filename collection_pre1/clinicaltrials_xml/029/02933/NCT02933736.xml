	<brief_summary>In propose trial , patient administer ribociclib prior surgical resection tumor . Patients enrol time-intervals sequentially ( non-randomized ) . All patient orally-administered 5 dos LEE011 ( 900 mg/d ) final dose occur one 3 interval brain tumor resection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ribociclib ( LEE011 ) Preoperative Glioma Meningioma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>900 mg/d maximally tolerate dose ( MTD ) , determine recent Novartis-sponsored Phase I study advanced solid tumor patient . The recommend dose expansion Phase 2 600mg/d 3 week 1 week . Due drug pharmacokinetics , MTD ( 900mg ) dose use pre-surgical dose order maximize opportunity identify relevant tumor pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamics endpoint . To assess PK , PD , PG endpoint list , CSF brain tumor tissue collect intraoperatively ( glioma , enhance non-enhancing tumor tissue collect analyzed separately ) . Additionally , blood sample obtain 0.5 , 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 24 hour final ribociclib dose administer . Patients tumor demonstrate positive PK , PD , PG effect continue treatment ribociclib ( 21 day , 7 day ) surgery . This constitute Phase II component study . Patients treat unacceptable toxicity observe , disease progression assess radiographic clinical metric . Preliminary rate progression-free survival patient high-grade gliomas high-grade meningioma treat ribociclib measure radiographic clinical response metric , specifically Response Assessment Neuro-Oncology ( RANO ) criterion investigator discretion . Overall survival patient high-grade gliomas high-grade meningioma treat ribociclib assess medical record review survival follow . Common Toxicity Criteria Adverse Event ( CTC AE 4.0 ) utilize review ribociclib treatment effect patient brain tumor . The trough plasma sample ribociclib collect pre-dosing clinical visit day ( e.g. , day 1 , 22 , 43 , 64 ... ) prior administration ceritinib day . Ribociclib administer clinic clinic visit day ensure collection trough level sample .</detailed_description>

Impairment gastrointestinal ( GI ) function GI disease may significantly alter absorption study drug ( e.g. , ulcerative disease , uncontrolled nausea , vomit , diarrhea , malabsorption syndrome , small bowel resection ) . History HIV infection . Other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition would , investigator 's judgment , cause unacceptable safety risk , contraindicate patient participation clinical study compromise compliance protocol .
