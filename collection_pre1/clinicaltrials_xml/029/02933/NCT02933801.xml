	<brief_title>ODM-201 Maintenance Therapy Patients With mCRPC Previously Treated With Novel Hormonal Agents .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The treatment metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer evolve rapidly past year . First line treatment one novel antihormonal drug abiraterone enzalutamide follow chemotherapy docetaxel standard care . If patient disease stabilization chemotherapy undergoes watchful wait period treatment start time disease progression . This trial test immediate use novel androgen receptor antagonist ODM-201 maintenance treatment chemotherapy aim prolong radiographic progression free survival compare watchful wait . The main objective trial assess impact maintenance therapy ODM-201 radiographic progression-free survival ( rPFS ) patient mCRPC pretreated novel hormonal agent non-progressive disease chemotherapy taxane .</detailed_description>
