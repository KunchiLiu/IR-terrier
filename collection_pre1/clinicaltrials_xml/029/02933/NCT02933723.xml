	<detailed_description>Summary : Study investigator recruit resident nurse home administer licensed influenza vaccine standard care , either trivalent influenza vaccine ( Fluvirin ) adjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccine ( Fluad ) . Eligible resident legally authorize representative give write , inform consent three blood draw one month 's time permission review nursing home medical administrative record , include information require submit Medicare include quality performance data ( Minimum Dataset MDS ) Medicare claim data demographic underlying disease comparison participate population nurse home . The investigator propose study 230 subject one season 1:1 ratio adjuvanted vs. non-adjuvanted vaccine . Background : Influenza common clinically important viral infection old adult . Influenza vaccination associate reduced hospitalization , stroke , heart attack death non-institutional older adult population , benefit influenza vaccine old population question . The adjuvanted vaccine show past elicit high antibody titer non-adjuvanted TIV . This include elderly population well . There far limited data cell-mediated immunity ( CMI ) use adjuvanted vaccine . There data support CMI important beyond helper function B cell . CMI help mitigate influenza disease antibody alone adequately protective . Objectives : To determine adjuvanted vaccine elicit high T cell B cell responses non-adjuvanted standard dose influenza vaccine nursing home resident .</detailed_description>
