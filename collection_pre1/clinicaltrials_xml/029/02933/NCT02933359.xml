	<brief_title>Osteogenic Profiling Normal Calvarial Bone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For outpatient study recruitment , research coordinator review clinic schedule potential study candidate . Any patient schedule pre-op appointment surgical calvarial reconstruction consider possible study candidate . The research coordinator e-mail study team list potential study candidate date time appointment in-patient study recruitment , screen procedure include review collection information patient 's medical record-specifically , physical examination plastic surgeon Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Center Plastic surgery department . This evaluation occur either inpatient outpatient , depend appropriateness timing ultimate surgical repair . During clinical examination , plastic surgeon determine portion skull unusable reconstruction . These bone fragment ( small shatter incorporated reconstruction ) normally discard . It fragment alone harvest evaluation present study . The evaluation surgical repair patient require post-traumatic reconstruction differ normal , current standard care . Bone sample collect bone tissue would normally discard reconstructive surgery , additional procedure need collect bone sample . At time surgery one sample tissue take bone . The investigator review result test/procedure part standard care result become part research record . The investigator continue use disclose identifiable medical information keep tissue sample seven year . After seven year period , identify information remove . Bone marrow tissue collect patient time surgery without additional dissection incision . Bone finely mince plated tissue culture flasks previously report group . The procedure involve extra incision dissection , tissue expose reconstructive procedure . At time surgery one sample tissue take otherwise discarded bone . Samples collect cod plastic surgeon/principal investigator transfer operative room Pediatric Craniofacial Biology Laboratory . The research coordinator notify Dr. Bykowski consent subject schedule surgery via e-mail . Dr. Bykowski collect cod sample transport Pediatric Craniofacial Biology laboratory . Cells tissue sample culture vitro . These cell eventually keep frozen lab temperature lock freezer . The Research Assistant Professor record subject information secure database Pediatric Craniofacial Biology Laboratory . No information permit personal identification family member make public . No clinical description might permit personal identification publish , clinical information store secure computer file Pediatric Craniofacial Biology Laboratory , password protect . Specimens store assigned code number information link thesis code number correspond subject ' identity also keep password protect database . If subject decide withdraw withdrawn study participation , linkage code subject 's identity specimen destroy . All cell grow one two medium . Proliferation medium use cell isolation expansion consist Dulbecco 's Modified Eagle 's Medium ( DMEM ) supplement 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) , 1 % penicillin/streptomycin . For mineralization study , cell grow osteogenic medium ( OM ) consist DMEM supplement 10 % FBS , 1 % penicillin/streptomycin , 10mM β-glycerophosphate , 0.1μM dexamethasone , 50μg/ml ascorbic acid-2-phosphate . Solid-phase print array square-shaped 'blots ' immobilize BMP2 print sialanized fibrin-coated glass cover slip . The blot 750 um x 750 um space 1.75 mm apart 4 x 4 array . There blot 4 different concentration BMP2 , range zero bind site saturation , along column , 4 replicates column . The homogenous fibrin film cross-linked glass slide prepare . Blot concentration modulate use overprint strategy . Pattern accuracy surface concentration growth factor persistence verify FGF2 . BMP2 bio-inks dilute 10 µg/ml 20 mM sodium acetate , pH 7.4 . Preliminary experiment immobilization persistence BMP2 fibrin film indicate least 6 day persistence . Bio-ink Formulations BMP2 Inhibitors . The purpose determine concentration provide initial validation pattern inhibition response . FGF2 bio-inks prepared . All bio-inks dilute 10 µg/ml . Since number bind site square fix , bio-ink dilution and/or number overprint may modify base initial result accommodate multiple growth factor occupy give square . From array study investigator determine concentration BMP2 inhibitor necessary show stimulation/inhibition . Cells place print pattern describe . Cells grown discreet array fix stained ALP activity ( Sigma ) 1 , 3 , 7 day culture growth factor pattern . Mineralization test culture cell pattern OM 7 , 14 , 21 day use alizarin red staining ( calcium ) von Kossa staining ( phosphate ) . ALP stain perform identify early osteogenic differentiation . To signify `` end '' BMP2 signaling , matrix mineralization determine positive von Kossa alizarin red stain use establish protocol . BMP2 potential inhibitor protein deposit simultaneously . The image pattern jet array Figures 1 3 , image pattern inhibitor BMP2 pattern , rotate 90° . The jetting coordinate stage motion two pattern exactly overlap use computer-vision calibration . Pattern accuracy verify use fluorescently-labeled BMP2 inhibitor . The concentration BMP2 capable induce ALP activity matrix mineralization concentration inhibitor capable counteract BMP2-induced osteogenesis identify record patient . In compare respective osteogenic potential , investigator develop `` osteogenic profile '' tissue sample isolate patient</detailed_description>
