	<brief_summary>One complication liver disease buildup fluid within belly . This known ascites . Patients ascites decreased appetite , pain , nausea shortness breath . Ascites typically treated medication , however work , patient need procedure needle insert belly every week drain excess fluid . About 2 5 patient ascites liver failure get kidney disease worsen liver function drainage fluid needle . Once patient advanced liver disease kidney disease , chance die largely increase . The present study first kind study new technique treat ascites . Investigators plan place tube patient 's belly drain excessive amount fluid . This technique similar one type dialysis do treat patient kidney failure . This study set pilot investigation order determine feasibility large , randomize clinical trial investigating use novel technique . Importantly , advance liver disease patient high risk develop kidney disease , therefore important group focus . Investigators believe technique prevent slow development kidney disease liver failure patient , improve quality life , far current available treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Peritoneal Dialysis Catheters Treatment Refractory Ascites</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Refractory ascites fluid recurrently accumulate peritoneal cavity , end result multiple mechanism , include liver cirrhosis , peritoneal infiltration tumor , portal hypertension , lymphangitic carcinomatosis , congestive heart failure , lymphatic obstruction . It associate increased mortality morbidity , include complication abdominal wall hernia , spontaneous bacterial peritonitis , kidney dysfunction , pleural effusion . The development ascites also lead multiple symptom include anorexia , early satiety , nausea vomiting , shortness breath , limited mobility . The management ascites associate liver dysfunction usually follow stepwise escalation treatment . The initial management typically involve sodium restriction diuretic therapy daily maximum 160 mg furosemide 400 mg spironolactone . When ascites longer control measure , one option decrease portal hypertension , main pathogenic factor ascites development , undergoing procedure call transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt ( TIPS ) . This procedure require certain patient criterion fulfil associated complication increase risk hepatic encephalopathy , therefore confine small subgroup patient ascites . Consequently , abdominal large volume paracentesis ( LVP ) treatment choice many patient . This procedure involve insertion needle peritoneal cavity ascites accumulates , attach needle collection system drain ascites gravity . The definitive treatment ascites patient cirrhosis liver transplant , due limit supply organ , contraindication transplantation , patient often undergo repeat LVP wait wait list death . Paracentesis associate risk include post paracentesis circulatory dysfunction lead hyponatremia , kidney dysfunction , viscus puncture , peritonitis . It also costly , resource intense , time uncomfortable treatment patient due procedure need repeat treatment . A potential alternative LVP placement intraperitoneal catheter , manner peritoneal dialysis ( PD ) catheter , drain ascites . The procedure high technical insertion success rate minimal complication routinely do bedside nephrologist local anesthesia . PD catheter placement ascites drainage many potential advantage , include ability do home patient avoid visit clinic hospital ; frequency drainage time patient symptom , perhaps less complication rate LVP . However , efficacy safety approach decompensated cirrhosis compare periodic LVP ( current standard care ) test randomized trial . Investigators propose single center , multi-site randomize control trial compare bedside PD catheter placement versus usual standard serial LVP treatment refractory ascites . The primary outcome improvement 10 point physical component score ( PCS ) Short Form-36 ( SF-36 ) two month . Investigators plan randomize 50 patient ( 25 per arm ) base power calculation achieve 10 point improvement PCS-SF-36 ( SE = 5 ) . Secondary outcome include incidence mechanical infectious complication , emergency department utilization , hospitalization mortality , domains SF-36 , Euroquol-5D ( EQ-5D ) , Newcastle Patient Reported Ascites Measure overall health care cost . Primary Hypothesis : Drainage ascites associate liver failure via PD catheter superior serial LVP improve physical component quality life measure SF-36 . This trial pivotal possibly change standard care management refractory ascites cirrhosis . If primary hypothesis confirm , investigator design conduct subsequent trial address potential morbidity mortality benefit associate technique ascites management .</detailed_description>
