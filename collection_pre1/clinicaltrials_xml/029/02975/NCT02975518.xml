	<detailed_description>The radial artery commonly injure follow trans-radial cardiac catheterisation injury demonstrate reduction endothelial function measure flow-mediated dilatation recovers time ( 13-15 ) . Thus radial artery useful model mechanical arterial injury radial artery trauma common endothelial function follow longitudinally non-invasive test . Endothelial progenitor cell localise sit arterial injury animal model vitro vivo accelerate re-endothelialisation well attenuate neointimal hyperplasia ( 16-18 ) , This however demonstrated man . Our research group , collaboration Scottish Blood Transfusion Service ( SNBTS ) develop good manufacturing practice ( GMP ) -compliant process manufacturing endothelial progenitor cell ( EPC ) product ( SNBTS manufacture final product administer patient ) . We also demonstrate vitro label cell radioisotope 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose ( 18F-FDG ) activity detect 200 cell use hybrid positron emission compute tomography ( PET-CT ) scanner ( Biograph mCT Siemens Medical Systems , Erlangen , Germany ) . We therefore able track fate cell vivo . The major potential advantage image way 18F-FDG associate EPCs deliver patient , remove issue background attenuation due `` free '' circulate 18F-FDG . A similar technique previously employ vivo track homing unselected autologous bone marrow cell infarcted myocardium ( 19 ) . Following intracoronary delivery use technique , author able detect 1.3 % - 2.6 % 18F-FDG-labelled cell infarcted myocardium . Demonstrating EPCs able home integrate site vascular injury man critical step understanding role EPCs vascular repair</detailed_description>
