	<detailed_description>Minimally invasive hernia repair laparoscopy standard treatment adult patient umbilical hernia large 2 cm Maria Middelares , Ghent . As previously describe chapter surgical guide review article surgical fixation technique laparoscopic umbilical hernia repair , use technique proven feasible end safe . Robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery become standard urology resection prostate carcinoma . In general abdominal surgery , large group surgeon currently work introduction robotic-assisted surgery resection colon rectal cancer daily practice . The third generation robot ( DaVinci Xi ) , extend applicability technology within field general surgery . For surgical treatment hernia 's abdominal wall defect ( umbilical or/and incisional hernia 's ) , currently surgeons US experience structure treatment program . From September 1 , 2016 Maria Middelares hospital introduce robot-assisted surgery , include laparoscopic TARUP umbilical hernia repair . Main obstacles introduction robot technology abdominal wall surgery prolong preparation time operate room require installation robot , high material cost related robot-assisted surgery . However , precise data available exact size extra time increase cost related introduction robotic assist surgery program abdominal surgery . The purpose study measurement evolution operation time start-up phase robotic-assisted surgery treatment umbilical hernia 40 patient Maria Middelares hospital .</detailed_description>
