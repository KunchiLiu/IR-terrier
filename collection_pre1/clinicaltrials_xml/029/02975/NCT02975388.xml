	<criteria>Body Mass Index ( BMI ) 18 38 kilogram per squaremeter ( kg/m^2 ) body weight least 45 kilogram ( kg ) Control group participant , Part 1 : Normal renal function base creatinine clearance great equal ( &gt; = ) 90 milliliter per minute ( mL/min ) Screening visit Healthy agegroup , determine investigator basis medical history , physical examination , clinical laboratory test result , vital sign , 12lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) Participants renal impairment , Part 1 : Reduced renal function base estimate creatinine clearance Screening visit . Creatinine clearance estimate serum creatinine concentration Screening visit use CockcroftGault equation , historical measure value obtain within precede 3 month . Participants severe , moderate mild renal impairment must creatinine clearance less equal ( &lt; = ) 29 , 30 59 , 60 89 mL/min , respectively Stable renal function . The stability renal function confirm two determination serum creatinine separate least 7 day ( one historical value within last 3 month ) . Renal function consider stable 2 serum creatinine value differ &lt; =30 percent ( % ) low value Participants endstage renal disease Part 2 : Reduced renal function clinical diagnosis endstage renal disease require renal replacement therapy Receiving hemodialysis 3 month time Screening visit Stable renal function Recipient renal transplant Presence renal carcinoma , acute renal disease cause infection drug toxicity Nephrotic syndrome ( define plasma albumin less [ &lt; ] 30 gram per deciliter [ g/dL ] and/or proteinuria great [ &gt; ] 3 gram per day [ g/day ] ) Hemoglobin concentration &lt; 10 g/dL , &lt; 9 g/dL participant endstage renal disease Potassium concentration &gt; 5.5 millimoles per liter ( mmol/L ) Clinically significant liver disease Uncontrolled blood pressure Any condition associate intravascular volume depletion Any unstable clinically significant disease Any ongoing condition disease ( apart renal dysfunction ) , clinically significant abnormality laboratory test result investigator considers would render participant unsuitable study , place participant undue risk interfere ability participant complete study Major surgery significant traumatic injury &lt; 28 day prior first administration ( exclude biopsy ) , anticipation need major surgery study treatment Recent history alcoholism , drug abuse , addiction within last year prior screen Positive test Screening follow : Hepatitis A , Hepatitis B , Hepatitis C , human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) Clinically significant change disease status judge investigator , major illness within 4 week prior Screening visit , febrile illness within 14 day prior Screening visit Use prohibit medication , alteration concomitant medication treatment regimen consider relevant investigator within 14 day Screening visit Known history clinically significant hypersensitivity severe allergic reaction drug , particular antibiotic ( e.g. , cephalosporin , penicillin , carbapenems , monobactams ) Participation another clinical study investigational drug device within 1 month precede Screening vist Donation loss 500 milliliter ( mL ) blood within 3 month Screening visit</criteria>
