	<detailed_description>Study Participants : For study , investigator recruit approximately 100 healthy control participants 100 Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) patient undergo deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) routine standard care . Screening : For healthy control participant , investigator approach adult , age 18-90 , possible involvement study . Potential participant ask ever diagnose movement disorder , psychiatric disorder , dementia . For PD patient undergo evaluation DBS , investigator first consult neurologist neurosurgeon . Next , investigator approach participant explain study . Healthy Controls : Healthy control complete standardize questionnaire play computer game assess cognition , take longer 30 minute . PD Participants : As part usual DBS process treatment side effect PD University Florida ( UF ) , PD participant ask participate trial . There three evaluation time point : surgery , surgery , possibly surgery . Before surgery , PD patient complete standardized questionnaire train computer game assess cognition . During surgery , participant play computer game brain signal record . When patient return University Florida DBS program visit within 12 month surgery , repeat standardize questionnaire computer game .</detailed_description>
