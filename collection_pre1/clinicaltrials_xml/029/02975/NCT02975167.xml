	<detailed_description>Labor induction one common obstetric procedure perform U.S . In 2013 , last year data available , 23.1 % delivery result induction . Labor induction often first require cervical ripening , accomplish several different method . Pharmacologic cervical ripening approach include vaginal oral prostaglandin administration . Mechanical cervical ripen method include osmotic dilator laminaria , transcervical Foley catheter without extra amniotic saline infusion . The ideal cervical ripen tool effective , safe mother fetus , incurs low cost , require extensive monitoring , cause minimal maternal discomfort . Several recent meta-analyses demonstrate safety efficacy Foley catheter pre-induction cervical ripening . When compare prostaglandin , study show use transcervical Foley catheter pre-induction cervical ripening result either shorten statistically significant difference vaginal delivery rate 24 hour . No study demonstrate long duration vaginal delivery cesarean delivery rate equivalent . In addition , woman Foley catheter experience less uterine hyper-stimulation result fetal heart rate change compare receive prostaglandin . Other one study suggest increased risk chorioamnionitis neonatal infection , vast majority research suggest Foley catheter overwhelm safe little risk severe maternal neonatal morbidity . Due safety profile ongoing desire reduce healthcare cost , many institution initiate outpatient cervical ripening protocol . Studies suggest outpatient cervical ripen transcervical Foley catheter safe effective . In addition , study demonstrate woman underwent outpatient cervical ripen spent less time hospital labor induction , sometimes result significant cost saving institution . The combination safety , ease use cost saving potential make outpatient cervical ripen Foley catheter appeal tool clinician patient . However , data patient satisfaction almost method cervical ripen sparse . Existing data patient satisfaction outpatient versus inpatient induction labor stem prior study use vaginal misoprostol gel isosorbide mononitrate induction agent . While one study suggest overall satisfaction outpatient Foley catheter cervical ripening , randomize control trial topic yet perform .</detailed_description>
