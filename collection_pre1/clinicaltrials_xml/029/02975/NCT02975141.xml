	<brief_title>Afatinib Gemcitabine/Nab-paclitaxel Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( PDAC ) remain almost uniformly lethal disease . Although significant progress understand underlie molecular biology pancreatic cancer , progress translate substantially good treatment . Alarmingly , number pancreatic cancer case constantly rise pancreatic cancer second frequent cause cancer relate death 2030 . Accordingly , novel therapeutic strategy patient pancreatic cancer desperately need . Recently , combination gemcitabine nab-paclitaxel proofed superior compare single agent gemcitabine ( overall survival [ OS ] 8.7 month nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine group versus 6.6 month gemcitabine group ; hazard ratio death , 0.72 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.62 0.83 ; P &lt; 0.001 ) . Consequently , combination therapy regard novel treatment option patient metastatic pancreatic cancer therefore serve backbone future clinical study . Preclinical study suggest significant role ErbB signal pathogenesis pancreatic cancer . Accordingly , target family ErbB receptor tyrosine kinases seem viable option improve outcome patient pancreatic cancer . Addition selective reversible EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib gemcitabine significantly improve progression-free survival overall survival metastatic pancreatic cancer patient . However , effect median survival time absolute value two arm ( erlotinib gemcitabine versus gemcitabine alone ) account less half month . Afatinib selective , potent irreversible ErbB family blocker . Unlike erlotinib , afatinib covalently bind irreversibly block signal homo- heterodimers form ErbB family member EGFR ( ErbB1 ) , HER2 ( ErbB2 ) , ErbB3 ErbB4 . Afatinib apply orally daily . Preclinical study suggest application afatinib result great efficacy tumor growth application erlotinib . Afatinib monotherapy marketing authorization treatment locally advance metastatic non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) activate EGFR mutation/mutations daily dose 50 mg daily . In Phase I trial safety tolerability afatinib combination gemcitabine patient advance solid tumor maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) 40 mg afatinib ( give continuously daily ) plus 1000 mg/m2 gemcitabine D1 D8 21-day cycle , dose-limiting toxicity respective cohort . Accordingly , another current Phase II trial sponsor treatment metastatic pancreatic cancer dose 40 mg continuously orally daily give afatinib combination 1000 mg/m2 gemcitabine give Day1 , Day 8 , Day 15 28-day cycle monotherapy gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 use . The investigator hypothesize addition afatinib gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel might result good anti-tumor activity . Accordingly , aim trial establish MTD afatinib combination gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel order proceed Phase II trial .</detailed_description>
