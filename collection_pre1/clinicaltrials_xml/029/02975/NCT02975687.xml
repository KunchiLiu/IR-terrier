	<detailed_description>In single-center , open-label , nonrandomized , control , prospective clinical trial , total 20 resistant refractory CD19+ B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) patient enrol . Patients diagnose accord morphologic , immunologic , cytogenetic molecular ( MICM ) criterion , include bone marrow morphology , immunophenotype , cytogenetic molecular examination . CD19 CAR T cell transduce lentiviral vector express anti-CD19 scFv TCRζ:4-1BB , administer i.v . injection use `` split dose '' ( total dose 5x10^6/kg-5x10^7/kg ) approach dosing:10 % day 0 , 30 % day 1 60 % day 2 . This protocol give subject unmet medical need effective therapy know time . Side effect CD19 CAR T cell therapy monitor . The purpose current study determine clinical efficacy safety CD19 CAR T cell therapy patient chemotherapy resistant refractory CD19+ ALL .</detailed_description>
