	<brief_title>Phase II Trial SBRT Compared With Conventional Radiotherapy Oligometastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) lead cause cancer-related death worldwide . Approximately half patient NSCLC present metastatic disease time diagnosis , predominant pattern failure patient localize NSCLC distant metastatic spread . The standard treatment metastatic disease cytotoxic chemotherapy mean overall survival 8-11 month . Various study suggest patient clinically present limited number metastasis , term define oligometastatic disease , could better prognosis survival radical treatment , counterpart great number metastasis . Much current clinical outcome oligometastatic disease base series retrospective study . This randomise prospective phase II study base patient stage IV oligometastatic NSCLC accord UICC stage system ( version 7,2009 ) oligometastatic disease radical operation stage I-III NSCLC . The purpose study add information current medical literature efficacy safety Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy ( SBRT ) compare conventional fractionated radiotherapy oligometastatic non-small cell lung cancer ( equal less 5 site equal less 5cm maximum diameter ) . The patient enrol receive firstly 4-6 cycle chemotherapy ( platinum-based doublet chemotherapy ) , achieve response ( stable disease partial response complete response ) . Patients randomize two group . The control group undergo conventional fractionate radiotherapy metastatic site primary tumor . The experimental group receive SBRT primary lesion metastatic lesion . The investigator compare progress free survival ( PFS ) , overall survival , incidence treatment-related adverse event two group .</detailed_description>
