	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) and/or recommend Phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) nanoparticle albumin-bound rapamycin ( ABI-009 ) administer intravenous infusion 30 minute day 1 8 21-day cycle , combination temozolomide irinotecan hydrochloride ( irinotecan ) ( administered day 1-5 ) pediatric patient recurrent refractory solid tumor , include central nervous system ( CNS ) tumor . II . To define describe toxicity single-agent ABI-009 administer intravenous infusion 30 minute day 1 8 21-day cycle pediatric patient recurrent refractory solid tumor , include CNS tumor . III . To define describe toxicity ABI-009 administer intravenous infusion 30 minute day 1 8 21-day cycle combination temozolomide irinotecan ( administered day 1-5 ) pediatric patient recurrent refractory solid tumor , include CNS tumor . IV . To characterize pharmacokinetics ABI-009 pediatric patient recurrent refractory solid tumor , include CNS tumor . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To preliminarily define antitumor activity ABI-009 combination temozolomide irinotecan within confines phase 1 study . II . To assess biologic activity ABI-009 examine S6K1 4E-BP1 expression status archival tumor tissue solid tumor pediatric patient use immunohistochemistry . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study nanoparticle albumin-bound rapamycin . Patients receive nanoparticle albumin-bound rapamycin intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 8 begin course 1 . Patients also receive temozolomide orally ( PO ) irinotecan hydrochloride PO day 1-5 begin course 2 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 35 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
