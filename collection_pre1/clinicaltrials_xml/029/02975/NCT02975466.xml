	<brief_summary>A `` ca n't intubate , ca n't oxygenate '' situation life-threatening physician must prepare react quickly . Similarly , difficult intubation adequate ventilation associate complication . In situation recommend different society , supra-glottic airway ( SGA ) device use help ventilation , intubation conduit ease airway access . The objective randomized control trial establish SGA , AuraGain , AirQ Blocker I-Gel , allow fast intubation time adult population , objective minimizing complication related situation . The investigator conduct three-arm trial compare different outcomes related installation SGA use intubation conduit . The result trial inform anesthesiologist device use close case airway emergency .</brief_summary>
