	<brief_summary>The transition chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) end-stage renal disease ESRD vulnerable challenge period time patient provider . Suboptimal control blood pressure know common patient advanced stage CKD , may contribute elevate risk progression ESRD , cardiovascular morbidity , mortality . This proposal pilot randomize control trial design test whether intensive blood pressure lower feasible safe patient advance CKD transition ESRD .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Examine Risk Feasibility Remote Management BP From CKD Through ESRD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The transition advance chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) , estimate glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73m2 , end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) represent vulnerable period , multiple physiologic psychosocial change occur patient prepare either dialysis kidney transplant . This study pilot randomize control trial test safety feasibility study strict versus usual BP control population patient advance CKD ( eGFR &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73m2 ) , include diabetes . For pilot study , randomize 60 patient advanced CKD elevate BP either home SBP target &lt; 120 mm Hg ( intervention group ) versus 130-140 mm Hg ( usual care group ) .</detailed_description>
