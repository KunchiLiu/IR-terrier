	<detailed_description>Cerebral palsy ( CP ) common physical disability childhood , affect 2 2.5 per 1000 live-births worldwide 1.3 per 1000 live-births Hong Kong . It non-progressive lesion develop central nervous system affect control movement posture child . Children CP usually classify use Gross Motor Function Classification System ( GMFCS ) accord age-specific gross motor functional ability reliance assistive device ( walk aid wheel mobility ) . It ordinal grade system five level ( I V ) , self-initiated movement , sit , stand walking , describe relation different age group . Children level I II generally walk without aid child level III walk aid short distance usually choose wheeled mobility community setting . Children level IV limit motor ability assist standing , step , transfer . Children classify level V completely dependent transportation wheelchair lack antigravity postural control . Numerous study show child CP , regardless GMFCS level , demonstrate problem postural control sit standing , turn affect function participation daily life . The main deficit postural control sit child CP lack ability recruit direction-specific muscle severe child ( GMFCS level IV V ) inability fine-tune degree muscle contraction accord specific situation . Excessive contraction antagonist common compensatory strategy . These ineffective strategy compensate balance sit stand position affect child 's daily function desk work school , transfer ambulation . Postural control involve control body 's position space stability motility . Good postural control around trunk 'trunk control ' short , allow individual perform different task upright vertical posture without lose balance . The control trunk maintain balance either sit stand position usually test follow three condition : static balance , anticipatory balance reactive balance . Assessment trunk control child commonly part motor assessment Bruininks-Osteretsky Test Motor Proficiency . The main limitation motor assessment trunk consider one unit motor act , despite different segment spine . Preliminary finding young infant show infant lumbar control well movement quality reach action compare thoracic control . It seem specific outcome measure trunk control necessary demonstrate improvement movement quality like . There specific outcome measure assess balance , indication trunk control recover stability internal external perturbation Pediatric Reach Test ( PRT ) , Pediatric Balance Scale , Segmental Assessment Trunk control ( SATCo ) . It find commonly use outcome measure balance cover assessing three aspect balance mention . Most outcome measure require child able sit independently without hand support , make unsuitable child CP GMFCS level IV V. Furthermore , outcome measure limitation consider trunk one whole unit , consist different region . Among commonly use assessment trunk control , SATCo recently refine assessment segmental trunk control child . The child 's trunk control examine progressively reduce trunk support shoulder girdle pelvis order assess head control , upper thoracic , mid-thoracic , low thoracic , upper lumbar , low lumbar full trunk control . The trunk control test 3 different condition sit : maintain posture ( static control ) , voluntary head movement ( active control ) recovery trunk control disturbance balance nudge ( reactive control ) . ( Butler et al , 2010 ) The preliminary result SATCo show high inter-rater reliability ( ICC â‰¥ 0.8 ) moderate good correlation establish motor assessment ( r 0.65 0.88 ) . Besides assess trunk different segment , SATCO one rare one able assess reactive balance . It recommend increase comprehensiveness assess balance mechanism child CP , researcher use SATCo combination outcome measure assess dynamic sit balance , PRT . Interactive computer play ( ICP ) become popular rehabilitation people motor impairment , include child CP . During ICP , child interacts play virtual object computer-generated environment , use computer console platform software , allow child control game certain body movement . Because computer game fun enjoyable , child repeat require body movement numerous time get high score game without lose interest . These numerous repetition ( essentially mass practice ) feedback game score ( knowledge performance result ) important motor learn enhance neuroplasticity . Hence , ICP may feasible way improve trunk control child CP , addition conventional therapy . Up date , six publish study use ICP virtual reality improve balance child CP.. From 6 publish study , promise though conflict result find whether ICP effective improve trunk control child CP . The main limitation study overall low level study quality , small sample size heterogeneous population group umbrella term CP . In fact , similar conclusion future study large sample size rigorous study design echo four recent systematic review topic . One possible reason conflict conclusion use ICP rehabilitation child CP may lack sensitive outcome measure capture specific change trunk control post-intervention . The above-mentioned study either use general motor assessment outcome measure unknown psychometric property assess posture participant . Besides , child receive ICP intervention stand position , compensatory strategy , due uncontrolled degree freedom low limb , might use maintain trunk control challenge position sit position . These compensatory strategy may turn , water overall effect ICP intervention trunk control . Most study examine one two aspect trunk control test static anticipatory balance child . The commercial gaming console , Nintendo Wii Fit , specifically developed child CP elicit target movement overcome impairment software may sensitive enough translate subtle movement change increase game score well adequate challenge child . Tymo ( Tyromotion , Austria , www.tyromotion.com ) wireless force plate detect movement centre pressure , either sit stand position . Force weight distribution measure use software provide Tymo two position . During assessment , user move trunk forward , backward sideways far . The amplitude force weight distribution two side body record . This information use user use Tymo balance training module , user move trunk forward , backward sideways participate computer game . For example , user move trunk different direction manoeuvre basket catch fall apple . The difficulty game adjust accord information provide assessment user need move body accordingly different direction without lose balance . This equipment specially design rehabilitation people movement disorder , hence unlike commercial game , flash light sudden noise game . 20 child CP similar physical disability recruit 2 special school child physical disability Hong Kong . Informed consent seek parent guardian study commence . After initial assessment , study child randomly allocate control group treatment group ( 10 child arm ) use 'draw card hat ' . The randomization separately do school . The child treatment group receive train trunk control use Tymo sit 4 time per week 20 minute per session . The treatment last 6 week . All study child continue usual therapy school ask stop playing interactive computer play , design train balance Nintendo Wii balance board , study period . As strong research evidence commercial computer game effective improve balance child CP type commercial computer play routine training exercise balance school , believe discontinue type 'training ' 6 week would cause detrimental effect balance study child . All assessment carry blinded assessor , aware group allocation child . All child assess beginning , 3 , 6 12 week commencement intervention . All child calibrate use Tymo static sit position treatment session research staff amplitude force weight distribution generate child two side body record . This information use set Tymo training module ( intervention ) software , child move trunk forward , backward sideways participate computer game sit . The child choose game want treatment session stay game least 10 minute change another game . The child maximal choice 2 computer game treatment session . All child start medium level difficulty . Only child unable score point 3 trial row , difficulty level reduce one level . Similarly , child score full point 3 trial row , difficulty level increase one level . The progression intervention closely monitor research staff . A logbook use child record level difficulty treatment session , number treatment session , duration session general comment child session intervention phase research assistant .</detailed_description>
