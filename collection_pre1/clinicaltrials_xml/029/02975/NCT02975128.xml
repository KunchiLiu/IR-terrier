	<brief_title>Minimal Invasive Breast Cancer Excision Using Breast Lesion Excision System Under Ultrasound Guidance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : In Netherlands , ≥7000 woman operate small breast cancer yearly . In study , evaluate condition possible excise small breast cancer use Breast Lesion Excision System ( BLES ) ultrasound ( US ) guidance . When successful , allow ambulatory treatment woman small breast cancer , improve cosmetic outcome quality life . Objective : Our study aim ass whether feasible remove small breast cancer completely use BLES system US guidance . Study design : This multi-centre , translational clinical phase II study 125 woman cancer ≤1.5 cm base upon US measurement , without mammographic evidence extensive disease ( e.g . microcalcifications ) . Study population : Women cancer ≤1.5 cm base upon US measurement , mammographic evidence extensive disease ( e.g . microcalcifications extensive architectural distortion ) , tumor lie ≥6 mm away dermis , nipple pectoral muscle , eligible study . Intervention : In 125 woman cancer ≤1.5 cm base upon US measurement , without mammographic evidence extensive disease ( e.g . microcalcifications ) , conduct additional preoperative breast MRI ascertain lesion size , inform consent obtain . If lesion confirm ≤1.5 cm MRI lie ≥6 mm away dermis , nipple pectoral muscle , patient eligible . Moreover , patient ask fill questionnaire , detail risk profile comorbidity index . Under general anaesthesia normal surgical procedure , tumor first remove use BLES system US guidance , small skin incision ( &lt; 1 cm ) . Next , normal surgical procedure perform , excise BLES excision cavity ≥ 1cm margin surround tissue , also guide US appearance BLES procedure . Margin assessment perform separately BLES excision surgical specimen surround tissue . Main study parameters/endpoints : Main endpoint study frequency successful complete tumor excision BLES system , successful define 'having tumor free margin , residual ( situ ) cancer surgical specimen ' . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : Our approach allow test feasibility highly innovate approach remove breast cancer , minimal negative effect possible complication . While direct benefit detrimental effect study patient participate , study large implication many woman , breast cancer remain common cancer woman , due screening , cancer small . Further reduction impact local treatment still desire psychosocial somatic effect breast deformation substantial .</detailed_description>
