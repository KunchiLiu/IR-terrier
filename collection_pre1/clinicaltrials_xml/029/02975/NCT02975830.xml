	<detailed_description>Accurate understanding tracheobronchial anatomy important application various airway maneuver anesthesiology child . Significant variation discrepancy report tracheobronchial angle find literature . Various image modality range chest x-ray helical compute tomography ( CT ) use measure tracheobronchial angle child result vary study report equal angle [ 2016 ] others report right bronchial angle small left bronchial angle [ Kubota ] . The visualization air column tracheobronchial tree three-dimensional ( 3D ) CT-based image clear air column simulate actual internal shape airway . The high quality medical-grade ( 3D ) image obtain use CT data [ Uchida M ] . Computed tomography ( CT ) consider current gold standard airway measurement air-tissue interface well delineate CT image [ Reinhardt ] . We hypothesize RBA LBA unequal child like adult prone right mainstem intubation We measure right leave bronchial angle use three dimensional CT base image air column tracheobronchial tree .</detailed_description>
