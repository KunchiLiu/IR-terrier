	<detailed_description>Primary Aim : To compare , young child perinatal stroke , change UE function two treatment approach : 1 ) FES treatment , 2 ) conventional UE training . Secondary Aim 1 : To compare intensity ( i.e. , number repetition perform per treatment session ) FES treatment conventional UE training . Secondary Aim 2 : To compare adherence two treatment method ( FES treatment conventional training ) . Secondary Aim 3 : To evaluate parent child satisfaction FES treatment . This proof-of-concept , mixed method , pilot study use single-blind , randomize clinical trial design . The study involve two site : University Alberta Edmonton , Toronto Rehabilitation Institute - University Health Network . The total study duration three year , time commitment child 9 month . Participants complete two baseline assessment space 1-2 week apart , randomize one two group ( FES treatment conventional UE training ) . The treatment period last 12 week , follow 6 month follow-up period . Participants Twenty-four child ( 12 per treatment group ) participate . To reach target 24 child , total 30 child perinatal stroke recruit . This allow 20 % attrition . As pilot study , sample size base conservative estimate number child investigator anticipate able recruit enroll three year period two participate city . Participants recruit numerous mean , include two main clinical site : Glenrose Rehabilitation Hospital ( Edmonton ) Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital ( Toronto ) . Following recruitment , potential participant screen telephone interview Research Coordinator . Assessments Assessments UE function spasticity complete seven time throughout study : pre-treatment ( 2 assessment space 1-2 week apart ) , 18 treatment session , 36 treatment session ( i.e. , completion treatment ) , 6 week post-training , 12 week post-training 6 month post-training . The primary outcome measure Melbourne Assessment 2 ( MA2 ) . Secondary measure Assisting Hand Assessment ( AHA ) , Modified Tardieu Scale , accelerometry ass UE use daily life . A single occupational physical therapist site complete assessment . The assess therapist blind group allocation study objective . The parent child receive FES treatment ask participate semi-structured interview within one week child complete FES treatment . The interview complete phone one study investigator . The interview last 45-60 minute . The Researcher ask series open-ended question concern family 's experience , impression , FES treatment . The data collect semi-structured interview allow u gauge parent child satisfaction FES treatment . The interview digitally record transcribed verbatim off-line . The transcribed dialogue share parent , ask indicate whether accurate reflection interview ( i.e. , member check ) . Treatment Methods Participants randomize one two treatment group , FES treatment conventional UE training , use match pair design . The child match pair base Manual Ability Classification System level . This randomization method , use study work similar population , remove bias comparison two group ensure potential confounding variable ( i.e. , UE impairment ) equally distribute across group . A Research Assistant involve study randomize participant pick label box . Both treatment method provide single physical occupational therapist site . The dosage treatment two treatment group : 3 sessions/week session last 1 hour total 36 session hour train . Participants ask repeat task &gt; 10 time single treatment session . Treatment session video record regular interval ( i.e. , first session , every 9 session thereafter ) two reason . First video data allow investigator accurately quantify intensity treatment method time . The video view offline document number repetition perform type grasp , direction reach ( forward , lateral , across midline ) , etc . Second , video data review ensure treatment deliver adheres study protocol . FES treatment conventional UE training follow principle motor learn neuroplasticity , practice many repetition salient task . The difference two approach FES group , electrical stimulation assist child 's movement . During one hour training session , roughly half time spend focus unilateral activity affect UE ( similar CIMT ) , remain time spend engage bimanual activity ( similar intensive bimanual training ) . The task practice customized child 's ability goal , embed play . Both proximal distal muscle target , requirement achieve proximal control prior train distal movement . Previous work suggest target impairment forearm , wrist thumb therapy also lead improvement proximal arm muscle . The treat therapist may provide manual assistance need child he/she attempt task . As motor control return , difficulty level task progress withdraw assistance ( manual FES ) , increase complexity task . If child able complete task 5-7 time without assistance near-normal movement pattern , treat therapist progress task . The FES treatment group receive electrical stimulation participate functional training describe . At session eight pair self-adhesive surface electrode attach child 's skin . A variety toy use keep child occupied don doffing , take 5-10 minute . If child find remove electrode uncomfortable , electrode dampen easy removal . In adult , stimulation effective combine active movement . Thus , prior facilitate movement FES , child ask attempt movement 10 second . After time , FES trigger button push therapist help execute movement . Two commercially available FES device use . One MyndMove FES System ( MyndTec Inc. , Mississauga , ON ) , fully programmable FES device eight channel . This system allow motor practice 17 different reach grasping protocol . For example , child practice pinch grip , lumbrical grasp , palmar grasp , lumbrical hand opening , tripod grasp , etc. , without reach . The second FES device use Odstock 2-channel Stimulator ( FES Mobility Ltd. , Vancouver , BC ) . The Odstock device may use child practice reach movement walk outdoors longer distance indoors . Throughout train period completion training , treat therapist provide parent child treatment group education promote use affect arm daily activity home . Integrating improved UE function family routines believe important retention motor skill transfer everyday environment . Parents/guardians give diary , record 1 ) activity involve weak arm child practice home , include approximate length time minute , 2 ) new activity involve weak arm observe child . Participants wear two accelerometer ( wGT3X-BT wireless activity monitor , Actigraph ) , one wrist , duration every treatment session . This enable u record amount frequency arm movement elicit type treatment . Data Analysis Data accelerometer upload analyzed use ActiLife 6 software ( Actigraph ) . For child , change score clinical measure calculate follow : score 18 36 training session subtract mean two baseline score . A retention index also calculate child 's performance measure follow : score 6-week 12-week 6-month follow-up divide score end training ( i.e. , retention index 1 = perfect retention ) . Group raw score , change score retention indices outcome measure report mean + 1 standard deviation . For statistical test , alpha level set 0.05 . To test assumption normality , Shapiro-Wilk test use . Non-parametric test use assumption meet . To address primary aim , within-group between-group change primary secondary outcome measure evaluate use two-way repeat measure ANOVA , Bonferroni correction post-hoc comparison . The non-parametric Scheirer-Ray-Hare test use appropriate . An intention-to-treat analysis use . Video footage treatment session review extract total number movement repetitions/session ( intensity ) child . Five session recorded/child ( start treatment every 9 session thereafter ) . To compare intensity train group ( Secondary aim 1 ) , two-way repeated measure ANOVA , Scheirer-Ray-Hare test , use compare mean number repetition complete course training group . The total number hour train ( i.e. , dosage ) calculate child treat therapist ' record . The percentage child treatment group complete &gt; 35 hour train 12 week report . To compare adherence two treatment method ( Secondary Aim 2 ) , total number hour train compare group use independent t-tests , Mann-Whitney U test . Following member check ( describe ) , transcribe dialogue semi-structured interview import NVivo 11 ( QSR International ) data management , cod analysis . An inductive , ground approach take cod interview . The cod process involve two researcher one graduate student . First , three researcher independently review 3-4 interview take note idea term reflect content text . Next , researcher discuss content jointly develop cod scheme ( i.e. , code definition ) . This cod scheme apply interview researcher , discrepancy reconcile along way . Lastly , together researcher group identify code large category , relationship category consider .</detailed_description>
