	<brief_summary>Chronic rhinosinusitis , also call chronic sinusitis , common life-long disease affect 5 % Canadian population . Its symptom , include daily facial pain headache , inability breath nose complete smell loss , regularly impair one 's ability work enjoy participate daily activity . The annual cost chronic sinusitis Canada estimate $ 1.3 billion government pay estimate $ 860 million yearly chronic sinusitis treatment . Chronic sinusitis polyp , common type chronic sinusitis , usually treat combination medication surgery . Until , surgical treatment perform operating room , cost $ 3500 per procedure . But , recent study show new procedure , `` in-clinic polyp removal '' , provide improvement patient symptom level equal sinus surgery perform hospital operating room . Moreover , clinic polyp removal additional advantage include short procedure recovery time , significantly low cost health care system ( one-tenth cost $ 450 ) , short wait time treatment . With propose pragmatic trial , investigator determine whether clinic polyp removal procedure good sinus surgery operating room control patient symptom chronic sinusitis . The investigator also determine cost health-benefits patient , healthcare system society clinic polyp removal comparison sinus surgery do hospital operating room . The investigator know new treatment , clinic polyp removal , replace sinus surgery standard care patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>In-clinic Endoscopic Polypectomy Chronic Sinusitis With Nasal Polyps</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic rhinosinusitis ( CRS ) common , Canadian prevalence 5 % , associate significant morbidity health state utility value equivalent end-stage renal disease . Understandably , CRS impair workplace productivity productivity substantially increase follow surgical treatment . However , wait time receive surgical treatment ( ESS ) maybe 8 month longer , cost Government $ 3500/ESS procedure . The annual direct cost CRS estimate $ 860 million overall financial impact 1.3 billion dollar per year Canada . Endoscopic polypectomy clinic ( EPIC ) , potential disruptive innovation , drastically deescalated form ESS perform clinic instead operate room . EPIC appear provide quality life ( QofL ) improvement equivalent report ESS . EPIC short wait time low cost government , i.e . nearly one-tenth ESS $ 450 . A pilot economic evaluation study demonstrate EPIC cost-effective compare ESS . This create controversy treatment employ patient . Further , recent Cochrane review identify need high-quality randomise control trial determine ESS additional benefit polypectomy currently insufficient evidence draw conclusion superiority polypectomy ESS management CRS polyp . The propose national multicenter randomise control trial determine whether EPIC non-inferior current treatment standard , ESS , QofL improvement patient CRS polyp . It also assess cost-effectiveness performing EPIC place ESS . The investigator hypothesize EPIC non-inferior ESS QofL improvement reduce health care cost . This would imply EPIC dominant strategy ESS strategy represent over-treatment patient population . The study finding would position EPIC current CRS treatment paradigm thereby transform care reduce cost nationally internationally .</detailed_description>
