	<brief_title>Betadine Pleurodesis Via Tunneled Pleural Catheters</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tunneled pleural catheter ( TPC ) placement routine clinical procedure use set recurrent pleural effusion . The common clinical indication malignant pleural effusion use benign pleural effusion well ( due congestive heart failure , cirrhosis , etc ) . The primary benefit TPC placement relief dyspnea without need recurrent procedure . Despite success relieve dyspnea , problem long-term placement TPC 's . One risk infection estimate 5 % . Furthermore , drainage kit cost approximately $ 100 often pay out-of-pocket patient . Over time , may create substantial cost burden . Finally , patient undergo TPC placement require home drainage visit nurse . This significant resource utilization often require interruption patient 's home routine via visitation requirement . Occasionally , effusion longer reaccumulates follow TPC placement . In malignant effusion , pleurodesis ( see ) occur 50 % time malignant effusion . When pleurodesis occur , TPC may remove simple office procedure . Pleurodesis , act induce scar obliteration potential space visceral parietal pleura pleural effusion develop , different mechanism provide relief dyspnea . In USA particular , common agent use pleurodesis ( talc ) associate complication respiratory failure adult respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) , life-threatening condition . Talc also expensive . Povidone-Iodine , agent use pleurodesis many country , show highly efficacious give via modality . Studies report pleurodesis rate 90+ % Povidone-Iodine . It also favorable safety record inexpensive . Given factor , investigator propose prospective study use Povidone-Iodine time TPC placement promote pleurodesis . The investigator hypothesize pleurodesis occur quickly frequently , thus enable removal TPC , thereby save cost , risk infection , improve patient quality life . The investigator plan enrol patient prospectively undergo TPC placement part standard care . These patient would prospectively enrol randomized receive either usual care ( pleurodesis ) investigational medication ( povidone-iodine ) intrapleurally time procedure . The investigator would subdivide group prospectively patient malignant pleural effusion benign ( non-malignant ) pleural effusion . Following TPC placement medication administration ( necessary ) , nurse investigative physician would immediately follow recovery area ( monitor negative immediate outcome hypertension , hypotension , reaction , significant pain ) clinic per usual care ( start 1-2 week discharge long necessary ) . The investigator would monitor outcomes note elsewhere .</detailed_description>
