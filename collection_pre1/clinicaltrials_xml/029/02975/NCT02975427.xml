	<detailed_description>This prospective study conduct period December 2011 June 2013 Department Endocrinology Metabolism Başkent University . We enrol 185 participant admitted hospital weight loss therapy . After initial evaluation , participant prescribe appropriate diet caloric restriction exercise program underwent follow-up examination 3±1 month later . At end follow , 103 participant attend research . Anthropometric , bioimpedance laboratory measurement perform baseline second visit . We calculate difference anthropometric , bioimpedance laboratory measurement first second evaluation . Correlation analysis , multivariate linear regression analysis receiver operate characteristic analysis perform assess association laboratory metabolic variable decrease anthropometric bioimpedance analysis ( BIA ) measure , diet and/or exercise therapy . The secondary aim determine whether abdominal BIA well simple anthropometric measurement conventional BIA assess change metabolic variable .</detailed_description>
