	<detailed_description>The propose study involve recruitment participant population use data exist research study cohort recruit provide informed consent participation . Participants meet inclusion/exclusion criterion enrol study . Participants exist research study cohorts pulmonary function testing , chest CT scan , blood draw study visit occur every 18 month 3 visit . Some study procedure may repeat do part research project . 1 . Main study visit The following research procedure may perform course one visit accommodate scheduling need . The study visit take place Montefiore Clinical Translational Research Center University Pittsburgh Asthma Institute University Pittsburgh Medical Center - Montefiore Hospital may take 4 hour complete . - Informed consent - Medical history review demographic - Review inclusion/exclusion criterion - Physical examination include vital sign , weight height , waist , hip , thigh circumference . - Urine pregnancy test female childbearing potential - Asthma-focused quality life questionnaire - Exhaled Nitric Oxide ( eNO ) measurement - Spirometry - Methacholine challenge test - need repeat participant do part another study past 6 month . - Chest/Abdominal CT scan ( If participant Chest CT scan do within 6 month part research study , repeat study purpose . Only Abdominal CT perform ) - Research blood sample biomarker analyse - blood also use pre-bronchoscopy test case participant qualifies interested undergoing part 2 , bronchoscopy visit . - Adipose tissue biopsy ( Fat Biopsy ) : perform participant BMI≥25 ) . This repeat do previously test do fat different test fat previously . 2 . Optional sub-study On separate visit , subset 60 select participant ask undergo follow procedure obtain additional lung biological sample . This visit optional participant willing participate bronchoscopy portion . The investigator try recruit equal number ( n=15 per group ) obese asthmatic , obese non-asthmatics , non-obese asthmatic , non-obese non-asthmatics . The visit take place Montefiore Clinical Translational Research Center ( MUH-CTRC ) . The bronchoscopy procedure take 30-45 minute , preparation recovery time usually make visit 4-8 hour total . Participants expect fast 8 hour prior bronchoscopy procedure refrain drinking liquid day procedure . Participants may take usual medicine sip water . • Clinical laboratory test include complete blood count/differential/platelet count , prothrombin time/partial thromboplastin time , international Normalized Ratio , blood urea nitrogen , creatinine prior bronchoscopy . If patient refuse first blood draw , sample inadequate , labs run 30 day prior bronchoscopy visit , second blood sample 1 tablespoon may draw prior bronchoscopy procedure ensure patient healthy enough procedure . If Methacholine challenge do 30 day prior visit two date , pulmonary function test repeat . - Oral Wash : participant ask gargle salt water 1 minute spit container provide sample approximately 10mls ( 2 teaspoon ) study visit . - Tongue Scraping : tongue blade similar object use scrape participant 's tongue . This sample use determine bacteria participant 's tongue . This procedure take minute painful . - Participants rinse 10cc 's Listerine . This assure bacteria leave behind participant 's mouth prior bronchoscopy . - Bronchoscopy bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) , endobronchial brush biopsy Under local anesthesia , participant undergo bronchoscopy BAL microbiologic specimen . A light intravenous anesthetic titrate provide participant comfort necessary . Vitals sign monitor continuously , , procedure . This procedure consist 3 stage . 1 . Pulmonary Lavage : During pulmonary lavage , five 50 mL wash sterile salt-water solution inject bronchoscope . Fluid collect gentle suction research study . 2 . Bronchial Brushing : A small brush introduce bronchoscope gently rub small part surface lung . Approximately 10 brush perform collect epithelial cell . 3 . Endobronchial Biopsy : While bronchoscope insert , another small instrument pass bronchoscope take small sample ( biopsy ) tissue wall airway . Up 5 sample may take procedure . Following bronchoscopy procedure , participant closely monitor bronchoscopy recovery area return CTRC . Rarely , participant 's asthma may worsen procedure . Appropriate medical treatment overnight observation provide need . Participants allow drive home bronchoscopy . This sedatives used procedure may decrease drive ability . The investigator ask contact name number person pick participant bronchoscopy</detailed_description>
