	<brief_title>Bioavailability Red Wine Anthocyanins</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anthocyanins ( ANT ) water soluble pigment find plant , flower fruit consume part human diet , many time higher amount flavonoid class . Red wine also important source anthocyanins , especially Mv3glc . Several epidemiological study suggest consumption anthocyanin-rich food , include moderate consumption red wine , positively associate prevention cardiovascular heart disease . It become clear flavonoid bioactive form vivo necessarily occur nature , metabolites arise absorption take place.Therefore , study bioavailability red wine ANT important identify metabolite ( originated vivo ) actually reach target organ ( concentration ) may responsible postulate health benefit red wine . Intervention protocol : Urine sample peripheral venous blood ( 10 ml ) collect 10 h-fasting subject . Afterwards , volunteer consume 250 ml table red wine 150 ml young Port red wine blood sample collect 15 , 30 , 60 120 min wine ingestion . Another urine sample collect 120 min . Table red wine 12 % ( 250 ml ) young Port red wine 20 % ( 150 ml ) , two different food matrix rich ANT , provide amount ethanol ( 24 g ethanol ) . A thorough screening analysis ANT perform plasma urine sample collect volunteer different time point .</detailed_description>
