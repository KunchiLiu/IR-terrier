	<brief_summary>The investigator wish undertake randomize control non-inferiority trial evaluate ability simple low-cost method ( Hibler´s method wrap patient multiple insulate layer ) prevent intraoperative heat-loss child undergo neurosurgery anesthesia Malawi . The control group heat actively use warm-air blanket . The aim study evaluate whether Hibler´s method provide cheap technically simple way adequately preserve patients´ core temperature operate theatre resource-poor setting .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Preventing Inadvertent Hypothermia Paediatric Neurosurgery Malawi</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothermia perioperative set receive increase attention anaesthetic surgical care . The paediatric age group arguably increase risk thus deserve intensive focus . The investigator wish undertake randomize control non-inferiority study two different modality prevent inadvertent intraoperative hypothermia compare . The trial carry paediatric neurosurgical population South-East African regional tertiary care hospital . The primary objective determine whether low cost simple method effective safe expensive technically demand method . The goal recruit 40 patient two study arm . Patients young 12 year age present schedule neurosurgery approach give information study . If inform consent ( assent , applicable ) obtain , participant randomize one two different technique ; either passive heat preservation use become known Hibler´s method ( interventional group ) active warm warm-air blanket ( control group ) . Throughout study period core temperature measure continuously , purpose data accuracy maintain safety standard . Primary study outcome focus comparative ability method maintain acceptable core temperature . The trial also examine number secondary end-points prevalence shivering , conscious level , analgesia requirement , oxygenation overall cost . Upon completion study investigator seek publish finding relevant medical journal . Presenting result abstract form poster appropriate medical congress may also desirable .</detailed_description>

IV . Informed parental/guardian consent give Exclusion criterion : I. Pts . age 12 year old . II . Pts . temperature upon arrival anaesthetic suite lower 36,0 °C III . Pts . temperature upon arrival anaesthetic suite great 37,5°C IV . Pts . judge unsuited standardized anaesthetic technique chosen ( due know allergy , know suspected difficult airway require anaesthetic intervention , cardiovascular condition incompatible standard anaesthetic agent due condition choose technique deem unsafe )</criteria>
