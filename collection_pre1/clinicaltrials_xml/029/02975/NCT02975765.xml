	<brief_summary>Applying flapless piezocision corticotomies alveolar bone separate anterior mandibular teeth use piezosurgery device ( i.e . ultrasonic wave perform accurate incision without suture follow procedure ) may improve speed tooth alignment orthodontic treatment . This study consist two group , patient randomly assign one two group . The level pain discomfort procedure 18 patient ( experimental group ) evaluate , whereas second group ( control group ) receive traditional orthodontic therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>According American Association Orthodontists ( AAO ) , length comprehensive orthodontic treatment range 18-30 month , depend treatment option individual characteristic . In addition , orthodontic treatment time range 25-35 month extraction therapy , respectively . Reducing orthodontic treatment time one main goal orthodontist , due problem root resorption , periodontal disease caries associate prolonged treatment time . Many technique introduce accelerate orthodontic tooth movement ; surgical non-surgical . The surgical approach clinically apply test known prediction stable result . Surgical approach usually vary total block osteotomy flapless partial corticotomies .In spite corticotomy-assisted orthodontic treatment efficiency , invasiveness procedure ( i.e . require full mucoperiosteal flap elevation ) might limit widespread acceptance among orthodontists patient . Therefore , conservative flapless corticotomy technique recently propose . These procedure accomplish reasonably short period might produce less pain discomfort , gain good patient acceptance . Although various technique flapless corticotomy report successful practice , scientific evidence acceptance compatibility little literature .</detailed_description>
