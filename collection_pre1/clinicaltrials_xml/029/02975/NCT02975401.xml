	<detailed_description>Minimally invasive hernia repair laparoscopy standard treatment adult patient Maria Middelares , Ghent . A previously conduct study demonstrate symptom patient inguinal hernia ( verified via EuraHS Quality Life score ) effectively treat technique low recurrence rate low frequency long-term side effect . Robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery become standard urology resection prostate carcinoma . In general abdominal surgery , large group surgeon currently work introduction robotic-assisted surgery resection colon rectal cancer daily practice . The third generation robot ( DaVinci Xi ) , extend applicability technology within field general surgery . For surgical treatment hernia 's abdominal wall defect ( umbilical or/and incisional hernia 's ) , currently surgeons US experience structure treatment program . From September 1 , 2016 Maria Middelares hospital introduce robot-assisted surgery , include laparoscopic TAPP inguinal hernia repair . Main obstacles introduction robot technology abdominal wall surgery prolong preparation time operate room require installation robot , high material cost related robot-assisted surgery . However , precise data available exact size extra time increase cost related introduction robotic assist surgery program abdominal surgery . The purpose study measurement evolution operation time start-up phase robotic-assisted surgery treatment inguinal hernia 50 patient Maria Middelares hospital .</detailed_description>
