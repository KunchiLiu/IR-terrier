	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Safety , Efficacy , Pharmacokinetics ARGX-113 Patients With Myasthenia Gravis Who Have Generalized Muscle Weakness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Myasthenia Gravis ( MG ) autoimmune disorder characterize case T cell antibody responses neuromuscular junction protein skeletal muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ( AChR ) . Antibodies epitopes AChR neuromuscular junction cause failure neuromuscular transmission , result characteristic fatigue weakness associate severe disorder . The study evaluate innovative candidate MG .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Have ability understand requirement study , provide write informed consent ( include consent use disclosure researchrelated health information ) , comply study protocol procedure ( include require study visit ) . Male female patient age ≥18 year . Diagnosis autoimmune MG generalize muscle weakness meeting clinical criterion diagnosis MG define Myasthenia Gravis Foundation America ( MGFA ) Clinical Classification Class II , III , IVa , likely need respirator duration study judge Investigator . The confirmation diagnosis document support : Positive serologic test antiAChR antibody Screening least 1 follow 3 test : ( ) History abnormal neuromuscular transmission test demonstrate singlefiber electromyography repetitive nerve stimulation ( ii ) History positive edrophonium chloride test , ( iii ) Patient demonstrate improvement MG sign oral cholinesterase inhibitor assess treat physician . A total score ≥ 5 MG ADL Screening Baseline 50 % score attribute non ocular item . Patients require stable dose MG treatment prior randomization . For patient receive AZA , NSIDs , steroid , and/or cholinesterase inhibitor concomitant medication follow condition apply : AZA : treatment initiate least 12 month ago dose change last 6 month Screening . Other NSIDs ( e.g. , methotrexate , cyclosporine , tacrolimus , mycophenolate mofetil , cyclophosphamide ) treatment initiate least 6 month ago dose change last 3 month Screening . Steroids treatment initiate least 3 month prior dose change last month Screening . Cholinesterase inhibitor : stable dose &gt; 2 week Screening . Note : cholinesterase inhibitor must hold least 12 hour consistent revise manual QMG test recommend Myasthenia Gravis Foundation America Inc [ MGFA ] 1 , MGQoL15r , MG ADL , QMG , MGC assessment . Females childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test Screening negative urine pregnancy test Visit 1 prior administration IMP . Female childbearing potential define female participant unless postmenopausal ( define continuous amenorrhea ) least 2 year Follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) &gt; 40 IU/L surgically sterile ( i.e. , hysterectomy , bilateral oophorectomy , current document tubal ligation permanent female sterilization procedure ) . Determination FSH level use confirm postmenopausal status amenorrheic patient hormonal replacement therapy test result within postmenopausal range per central laboratory . Female participant childbearing potential must agree use highly effective method contraception ( i.e. , pregnancy rate le 1 % per year ) study 90 day discontinuation IMP . Adequate contraceptive method include combine hormonal contraception associate inhibition ovulation ( oral , intravaginal , transdermal ) , progestogenonly hormonal contraception associate inhibition ovulation ( oral , injectable , implantable ) , intrauterine device ( IUDs ) , intrauterine hormonereleasing system ( IUS ) , true sexual abstinence ( line prefer usual lifestyle participant ) , bilateral tubal occlusion , female participant childbearing potential . Female participant female partner male study participant use hormonal contraceptive must also use barrier method ( i.e. , condom occlusive cap [ diaphragm cervical/vault cap ] ) stable hormonal contraceptive treatment least 4 week Screening . Sterilized male patient vasectomy document aspermia post procedure include . In addition , male patient must advise donate sperm period signing Informed Consent Form ( ICF ) , throughout duration study , 90 day last administration IMP . Nonsterilized male patient sexually active female partner childbearing potential must use effective method double barrier contraception ( e.g. , condom spermicidal cream jelly , 1 hormonal plus 1 barrier method 2 simultaneous barrier method ) . Male patient practice true sexual abstinence ( line prefer usual lifestyle participant ) include . Females pregnant lactating . MGFA Class I , IVb , V. Have active infection , recent serious infection ( i.e. , require injectable antimicrobial therapy hospitalization ) within 8 week prior Screening ; history know infection human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) , hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) , Mycobacterium tuberculosis . Patients must negative test result HBV surface antigen , HBV core antibody , HCV antibody , HIV 1 2 antibody , negative QuantiFERON®TB Gold test Screening . Patients indeterminate QuantiFERON®TB Gold test result allow one retest ; negative retesting , patient exclude . At Screening , clinically significant laboratory abnormality : Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) &gt; 2 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) . Total serum bilirubin &gt; 1.5 x ULN ( except Grade 1 hyperbilirubinemia solely due medical diagnosis Gilbert 's syndrome ) . Serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg/dL creatinine clearance &lt; 50 ml/min ( use Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology [ CKDEPI ] Creatinine formula ) . Clinically Significant proteinuria ( i.e. , &gt; 3 x ULN ) . Hemoglobin ≤ 9 g/L . Thyroid stimulate hormone thyroglobulin outside central laboratory normal range . International normalized ratio ( INR ) activate partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT ) &gt; 1.2 x ULN . Total immunoglobulin G level &lt; 6 g/L . Body Mass Index ( BMI ) Screening ≥ 35 kg/m2 . Use rituximab , belimumab , eculizumab monoclonal antibody immunomodulation within 6 month prior first dose . Patients prior exposure rituximab must CD19 count within normal range per central laboratory Screening . Use biological therapy investigational drug within 3 month 5 halflives drug ( whichever longer ) Screening . Immunoglobulins give IV ( IVIg ) , intramuscular route , plasmapheresis/plasma exchange ( PE ) within 4 week Screening . Have know autoimmune disease MG would interfere course conduct study ( uncontrolled thyroid disease severe RA ) . Have receive vaccination within 4 week Screening vaccination plan study . Have history malignancy , include malignant thymoma , myeloproliferative lymphoproliferative disorder time , unless deem cured adequate treatment evidence recurrence ≥5 year Screening . Patients completely excise nonmelanoma skin cancer ( basal cell carcinoma squamous cell carcinoma ) cervical carcinoma situ would permit time .
