	<brief_summary>The subject Novel Motorized Spiral Enteroscope ( NMSE ) represent new technology offer advantageous option spiral enteroscopy fast less invasive approach . The system similar currently market endoscope incorporate flexible insertion tube , light source , digital imaging , channel pass accessory sample collection therapeutic intervention . The NMSE system unique incorporate user-controlled motor contain endoscope 's handle rotate spiral cuff locate endoscope 's insertion tube . Rotation cuff , soft spiral-shaped `` fin '' , pleat small bowel endoscope 's insertion tube , thereby allow rapid atraumatic access deep small bowel . The system also include display monitor , motor control unit , device display measure motor current signal torque , set foot pedal . Motorization Spiral Enteroscope limitation rotation short cuff instead long overtube promise accelerate procedure , facilitate insertion improve maneuver instrument comparison conventional spiral enteroscopy</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>General anesthesia and/or sedation prescribe accord institutional practice clinical judgment ; type , amount duration record . A standard esophagogastroduodenoscopy ( EGD ) perform prior enteroscopy . If preliminary exam endoscopist identifies stricture believe patient anatomy would cause excessive resistance Novel Motorized Spiral insertion examination , patient withdrawn study reason study withdrawal note . The Novel Motorized Spiral endoscope insert advanced assistance motorize clockwise spiral rotation , ( control directly operate physician via foot pedal ) . If point stricture observe excessive resistance advancement endoscope encounter , advancement endoscope must cease reason procedure termination document case report form . After reach depth insertion require patient treatment diagnosis , endoscope withdrawn use motorize counter-clockwise spiral rotation , also control foot pedal . Maximum depth insertion record maximum insertion depth failure advance endoscope tip reposition patient , apply abdominal pressure and/or use standard measure fail advance endoscope OR investigator decides terminate advancement base clinical judgment . During withdrawal , endoscopist cumulatively estimate length bowel release endoscope tip order calculate total depth insertion . Insertion depth reference Ligament Treitz . If clinician decides mark point maximum insertion , tissue may tattoo first create saline bleb , follow injection India ink ( e.g. , SPOT ) . Tissue sample and/or therapy perform withdrawal clinically appropriate . The detail sample and/or therapy ( number , type &amp; location ) record . The comfort cardiopulmonary stability patient monitor throughout procedure , per standard care - include continuous pulse oximetry , blood pressure , heart rate monitoring . Photographs video recording use document significant lesion tissue trauma . Postprocedural measure Patients hospitalize least 24 hour NMSE potential risk delay adverse event . Only liquid diet allow first 12 hour asymptomatic patient . Clinical investigation determination blood cell count serum level C-reactive protein do 24 hour . 30 day procedure patient interview telephone call evaluation complaint delay complication . Discomfort ( location severity ( 0-10 VAS ) document immediately NMSE , 24 hour discharge .</detailed_description>
