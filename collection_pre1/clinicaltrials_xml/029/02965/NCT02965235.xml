	<brief_title>Correlations Epigenetic Changes With POCD Surgical Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The incidence postoperative cognitive dysfunction ( POCD ) elderly patient range widely 16 % 21 % associate adverse outcome . The exact cause POCD remain unknown . Extensive study report epigenetic modification , include alteration DNA methylation chromatin structure , play important part regulation memory learning . The present study thus hypothesize epigenetic modification may increase risk POCD . The present study enrol elderly patient ( aged≥65 ) young middle-aged patent ( age 20-50 ) planning undergo elective noncardiac surgery general anesthesia . Perioperative clinical characteristic patient record . Participants enrol evaluated POCD Mini-Mental State Examination ( MMSE ) preoperative day , postoperative day 1 . Postoperative pain evaluate numerical rating scale ( NRS ) . The patient ' blood collect morning day surgery surgery recover consciousness detection concentration 5-methylcytosine ( 5mC ) 5-hydroxymethylcytosine ( 5hmC ) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) . The present study may help find whether epigenetic change occur surgical anesthesia stress important factor POCD elderly patient .</detailed_description>
