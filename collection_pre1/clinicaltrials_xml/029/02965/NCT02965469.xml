	<brief_summary>This study begin assess association perceive stress enhance age person live HIV ( PLWH ) . The investigator suspect relationship may mediate increase age within immune system subsequent low-level inflammation commonly lead multiple illness frailty one age . The finding study identify potential diagnostic therapeutic target improve health age PLWH could also apply HIV-uninfected population .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>While life expectancy increase markedly people live HIV ( PLWH ) , gain expect year life come cost - earlier onset great frequency age-associated comorbid condition , osteoporosis , metabolic syndrome , cardiovascular disease . Accumulated multi-morbidity likely cause much high age-expected rate frailty PLWH . Perceived stress prevalent PLWH , present , associated bad clinical outcome , include poor engagement HIV care , rapid progression AIDS , high AIDS-related mortality . Stress well-documented risk factor many illness demonstrate early onset PLWH , perceive stress hypothesize cause age . Nonetheless , role perceive stress early-onset age age-related illness PLWH essentially unexplored . Investigating interrelatedness aging , perceive stress , HIV may elucidate mechanism ( ) underlie phenotype premature age functional decline HIV patient implication understand fundamental mechanisms stress age HIV uninfected population . The propose randomized control study estimate correlation perceive stress age HIV-specific outcome measure feasibility cell phone-delivered stress reduction intervention . Participants complete structure interview measure cumulative life stress , perceive stress , intimate partner violence exposure ( traumatic stressor ) , functional status , frailty , potential covariates across age spectrum PLWH . Stress measure correlate biomarkers know associated functional decline age , HIV-uninfected population . The finding exploratory R03 , lead New Investigator , measure feasibility mobile technology stress reduction intervention estimate correlation perceive stress marker age HIV disease . The result use determine sample size necessary perform definitive study assess link perceived stress phenotype premature aging , well interventional study stress modification mitigate onset early multi-morbidity functional decline . These finding applicable HIV-infected HIV-uninfected population .</detailed_description>
