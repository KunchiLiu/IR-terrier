	<brief_title>Composite Outcomes Mesh v Suture Techniques Prolapse Repair : A Randomized Controlled Multicentre Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Rationale : The pelvic floor comprises muscle , nerve fascial network dynamic , elastic ligament support . Pelvic organ prolapse ( POP ) occur capacity accommodate pressure stretch exceed increase childbirth age . One five woman need surgery POP . POP suspension perform vaginally among important idea gynecology past decade , however investigator know technique best . The principal applicant develop novel surgery : bilateral sacrospinous vaginal vault fixation synthetic mesh arm ( BSSVF-M ) , may successful , durable cost-effective standard sacrospinous ligament suspension suture ( SSLS ) may thus become preferred vaginal POP surgery nationally internationally . A Cochrane review surgical management POP conclude `` adequately powered RCTs blinding assessor urgently need [ … ] particularly need include woman 's perception . '' The OPTIMAL trial , large RCT compare 2 POP surgery , establish stringent definition success use composite outcome objectively measure POP , subjective improvement need another treatment POP recurrence . Identifying best way surgically suspend vagina POP make difference woman enjoy desire level physical activity work play , empty bowel bladder without concern , engage normal sexual life woman ca n't perform basic activity without discomfort , pain , worry shame . The vaginal approach pelvic surgery offer less pain , short hospital stay , fast recovery external incision . However , safe , durable , cost-effective vaginal POP surgery ? Prior operation produce unacceptable complication need reoperation POP recurrence . Further suffer woman unacceptable healthcare cost ensue . Because senior ( age 65 ) fast grow age group Canada , CIHR state research age prioritize . By 2031 , Statistics Canada estimate number senior woman reach 5.1 million 24 % total female population . Women long life expectancy men . The burden POP increase age ; 1 2 woman 80 experience pelvic floor dysfunction . For age woman , vaginal surgery option comorbidities preclude invasive lengthier open abdominal surgery . Currently , true clinical equipoise BSSVF-M SSLS . Our novel mesh insertion technique , BSSVF-M , offer advantage small size , deep , tension-free tailor individual anatomy . This ensure midline restoration vaginal axis maintain flexibility normal bladder , bowel sexual function . Tension-free insertion BSSVF-M key difference SSLS , pull vagina tight ligament , cause pain return POP SSLS . Surgical innovation important adoption new procedure need reliable evidence acquire rigorous Innovation , Development , Exploration , Assessment , Long-term study ( IDEAL ) paradigm . The investigator study BSSVF-M past 9 year . Initial development include magnetic resonance imaging study establish restoration pelvic anatomy comparable normal . An exploratory prospective cohort study follow , show BSSVF-M safe , easily taught surgeon successful 77 % woman one year , OPTIMAL composite outcome . This superior report 60 % success SSLS inform power calculation propose RCT . An informal survey 50 Western Society Pelvic Medicine surgeon indicate average 14 % increase composite outcome success would sufficient adopt new vaginal suspension technique . The investigator IDEAL assessment stage , novel technique warrant RCT widespread adoption . The result trial directly inform surgeon whether mesh use vaginal repair POP counsel patient . This trial include knowledge translation woman understand pelvic floor symptom , relate condition-specific quality life , sexual health body image two vaginal surgery procedure . A rigorous cost effectiveness analysis inform different stakeholder policy maker regard cost effectiveness . Primary Objective : To compare BSSVF-M vs. SSLS via OPTIMAL composite outcome measure 2 year . Secondary Objectives : To determine condition-specific urinary , bowel POP symptom , quality life , new onset pelvic pain , gender-specific body image , sexuality , global improvement , adverse event , reoperations health utility 2 year post BSSVF-M vs. SSLS . Validated questionnaire adverse event scheme use . A Markov model estimate 10-year health benefit cost surgery . Interventions : Patients &gt; age 19 , symptomatic POP ( stage 1-4 ) randomize BSSVF-M SSLS . Both surgery perform vaginal incision . BSSVF-M us bilateral synthetic polypropylene mesh arm support vaginal wall SSLS use two synthetic suture attach uni- bilaterally . As performed incision , woman know treatment . Group assignment remain blinded trial end . Surgeons receive group allocation immediately prior surgery . To diminish bias , research personnel conduct pelvic exam evaluate primary outcome blind type procedure . Patients see examine 6 week , 1 yr 2 yr follow surgery . They fill questionnaire . At 6 month postoperatively , receive phone call fill questionnaire health utility purpose . Recruitment/Timeline : The investigator anticipate recruit 2.5 yr ( fall 2016-spring 2019 ) . Total timeline trial 5 yr , ensure follow-up recruited woman 2 yrs postop . The main centre Vancouver ( 2 surgeon ) commit recruit 1-2 patient per week 130 total . Edmonton ( 1 surgeon ) , Calgary ( 1 surgeon ) Montreal ( 2 surgeon ) would recruit 76 patient . Based prior experience pilot study BSSVF-M OPTIMAL , investigator anticipate approximately 90 % invited woman volunteer 5 % change mind participation baseline . Given NPA perform 4 8 vaginal surgery POP per month , investigator anticipate recruitment challenge . Based surgical volume commitment research , sit also reach target . All surgeon expert vaginal surgery POP ( include SSLS ) except one perform BSSVF-M . They currently offer BSSVF-M outside research study . According national credentialing organization surgical survey , surgeon require least 5 average 8 procedure become familiar new vaginal POP technique . Assistance 8 case provide surgeon untrained perform BSSVF-M . In addition , video instruction provide standardize procedure material . Challenges/Mitigation : Compliance problem : Compliance follow-up may issue due follow 2 year . Patients screen future compliance recruitment coordinator site follow patient quarterly 2 year , ask update contact information time point . Loss follow-up : The investigator anticipate similarity loss follow-up ( 15 % ) OPTIMAL . To mitigate loss follow-up , investigator reimburse patient parking travel cost small stipend . Unblinding participant : In event complication arise either surgery , patient assessor may become aware group assignment . For example , patient develop exposure vaginal mesh , pelvic examination reveal various time point surgery may need remove mesh expose vagina . This may introduce bias assessment various time point , however likely affect primary composite outcome measure 2 year . Based prior experience BSSVF-M , investigator anticipate unblinding complication less 5 % total sample . The primary surgeon deal complication need reoperation involve pelvic examination assessment . Most complication correct 2 year , blind assessor 2 year unable identify group assignment . Sample size : 179 women/group ( 358 total ) . Our Western Canadian survey 50 surgeon indicate small clinically relevant difference change surgical practice would absolute change 14 % . The proportion success control SSLS group 60.5 % OPTIMAL trial success rate BSSVF-M 77 % one-year pilot study . Our pilot study small design inform power calculation RCT ; study long-term result , cost effectiveness KT strategy . Studies mesh v suture surgery urinary incontinence indicate mesh successful , durable cost-effective suture , therefore investigator expect similar result POP , sustain durability mesh time . Our primary analytic strategy , follow example OPTIMAL trial , include patient come 2-yr follow-up failure last follow-up . Patients come 2-yr follow-up failure last follow-up count failure . Sample size determine base two-sample test independent proportion , use two-sided µ=0.05 , anticipate successful outcome rate 60 75 % , power=80 % yield 152 patients/group . To account estimated 15 % loss follow-up ( patient never follow-up visit deem successful last follow-up ) , similar OPTIMAL trial , sample size increase 179 per group . Allocation : Random allocation via web-based allocation system . A statistician generate list random allocation , stratify surgeon use randomly size permute block prevent bias guess next treatment allocation . Although surgeon skilled technique , difference experience may impact outcome . By stratify surgeon , investigator ensure similar number allocation treatment hospital . Patients enrol research personnel participate centre . The site coordinator randomize patient prior surgery use web-based allocation system . Patients blind type procedure receive 2 year surgery . Research personnel evaluate outcome person visit blind type procedure receive participant .
