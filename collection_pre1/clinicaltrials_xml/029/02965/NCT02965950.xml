	<brief_summary>This multicenter , open label , phase 2 clinical trial , patient stratify one two treatment group base upfront TP53 mutation status ; i.e . TP53 mutate vs. TP53 wt disease , treat dose-dense cyclphosphamide . Furthermore , patient include stratify base tumor stage ; i.e . locally advanced breast cancer ( M0 disease ) metastatic breast cancer ( M1 disease ) . All participate cancer center prospectively include patient breast cancer fulfil inclusion criterion . If patient respond experimental treatment outline protocol , treatment dose-dense cyclophosphamide terminate , cancer treatment continue treat oncologist 's discretion . The response data patient receive least one chemotherapy course include final efficacy analysis . Tumor tissue , blood sample radiology data collect therapy start , therapy need change , patient locally advance breast cancer : surgery . Response data evaluate closely treatment , clinical assessment tumor size every two week patient locally advance breast cancer radiology every eight week patient metastatic breast cancer . Evaluation side effects/tolerance perform every clinical visit , i.e . every two week patient include p53 trial .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Stage IV breast cancer ( distant metastasis ) remain non-curable condition ; thus , treatment consider palliative . However , many patient may live year metastatic disease reasonably good quality life . As locally advanced primary breast cancer need primary medical therapy , lack responsiveness regular chemotherapy associate poor prognosis , high risk relapse , subsequent , breast cancer death . TP53 mutation show predict poor response anthracyclines , group cytotoxic agent extensively use general efficacious breast cancer . Notably , dose-intensification cyclophosphamide find significantly improve response rate TP53 mutate primary breast cancer . Our preliminary experience indicate use dose-dense cyclophosphamide monotherapy every 2nd week G-CSF support well tolerate . As patient metastatic disease alternative would receive continuous chemotherapy 3-weekly interval hypothesis cyclophosphamide give 2-weekly interval limited time period , follow `` treatment holiday '' among responder associate non-inferior quality life all-over . As patient TP53 mutate locally advanced breast cancer standard chemotherapy fails , hypothesis cyclophosphamide dose dense treatment may effective treatment option downstaging tumor prior surgery .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Locally advanced breast cancer need presurgical chemotherapy metastatic breast cancer conventional therapy fail ( see ) Resistance endocrine therapy : Metastatic disease : either ) estrogen progesterone negative tumor , ii ) harbor estrogen / progesterone positive tumor regular endocrine therapy fail treat physician find endocrine therapy indicate . LABC need presurgical therapy , practice patient select chemotherapy endocrine therapy , except old patient tumor express strong hormone receptor staining . Here , inclusion criterion patient treat physician select primary chemotherapy instead endocrine therapy base clinical assessment . In metastatic setting , patient enrol expose developed resistance least one conventional regimen contain taxane . Exposure anthracyclines prior inclusion accept , mandatory patient TP53 mutate cancer . For patient TP53 wt tumor mandatory anthracycline regimen use previously . Taxanes apply metastatic setting ; alternatively , patient relapse within 2 year subsequent adjuvant chemotherapy may consider resistant drug apply adjuvant setting . This relate also patient could receive proper taxane therapy due side effect medical reason . As response , patient lack clinical benefit ( SD , PR CR ) acquire resistance ( progression initial response ) metastatic breast cancer . For patient harbor locally advance breast cancer ; previous chemotherapy treatment contain taxane . Anthracyclines consider mandatory ( see ) case tumor reveals TP53 mutation ( similar metastatic cancer ) . Further , patient obtain nonoptimal response conventional regimen ( ) give ; i.e . lack objective response ( PR CR ) locally advanced breast cancer . The primary tumor least one metastatic lesion must available biopsy collection protocol inclusion . Notably ; patient primary metastatic breast cancer , TP53 status determine metastatic deposit ; tissue primary tumor may substitute ( relate patient synchronous metachronous metastatic disease ) . Patients must clinically and/or radiographically document measurable breast cancer accord RECIST . WHO performance status 01 Known tumor ER , PGR HER2 status current situation , i.e . archival historic breast cancer tissue use patient relapse disease . However , patient include regardless hormone receptor HER2 status ; case information lack inclusion , may analyse biopsy retrospectively . Age &gt; 18 year Radiology study ( CT thorax/abdomen bone scintigraphy/bone scan ) ecco cor must perform within 28 day prior registration . Before patient registration , write informed consent must give accord national local regulation . Blood test requirement : Neutrophils &gt; 1.0 x 109/L Platelets &gt; 75 x 109/L Bilirubin &lt; 20 Âµmol/L . Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 x ULN Comorbidity , base assessment treat physician , may preclude use cyclophosphamide actual dos . Psychological , familial , sociological geographical condition ( ) potentially hamper compliance study protocol followup schedule ; condition discuss patient registration trial Pregnant lactating patient include . Clinical evidence serious coagulopathy . Prior arterial/venous thrombosis embolism exclude patient inclusion , unless patient consider unfit study oncologist . Active cystitis ( treated upfront ) Active bacterial infection Urinary obstruction Known hypersensitivity towards cyclophosphamide pegfilgrastim , metabolites ingredient drug administration formulation . Patient able give inform consent comply study regulation deem study investigator .</criteria>
