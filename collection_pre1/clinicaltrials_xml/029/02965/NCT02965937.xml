	<brief_title>Effectiveness Story-Centred Care Intervention Program Older Persons Living Long-term Care Facilities</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Design A single-blind two-group longitudinal experimental study conduct compare story-centred care intervention program health consultation control condition . After receive informed consent , participant randomly assign one two treatment condition , either story-centred care intervention program health consultation control condition . Each intervention conduct 4 week . Measurements obtain follow time point : pre-intervention ( baseline ) , post-intervention 1-month- 3-month follow-up ( see Figure 1 ) . Outcome measurement include follow parameter : 15-item geriatric depression scale test ( GDS-15 ) , short portable mental status questionnaire ( SPMSQ ) , WHO Quality Life-BREF ( WHOQOL-BREF ) , blood pressure 5-minute HRV . Recruitment Participants recruit January 2013 August 2013 via poster notification routine activity gathering . The study design protocols review approve institutional review board participate hospital . At content session , assessment procedure fully explain . When participant express interest participating study , need leave contact information front desk . The research team contact participant soon list compile . Assessment eligibility randomisation Participants beconsidered eligible meet inclusion criterion . All participant inform withdraw study time . Before randomisation , participant ask answer questionnaire subject 5-minute HRV test . The questionnaire include demographic characteristic , 15-item geriatric depression scale test ( GDS-15 ) SPMSQ . Randomisation conduct use computer-generated randomisation scheme ( SPSS software Version 21.0 ) . Participants randomly assign story-centred care intervention program health consultation control condition . The random allocation sequence set uniform 1:1 allocation ratio . Blinding Participants randomly assign either story-centred care intervention program health consultation control condition . They inform disclose randomisation status anyone . The outcome evaluator blind assign condition participant . Intervention Participants randomly assign experimental ( intervention ) group ( IG ) control group ( CG ) use SPSS software ( Version 21.0 ) . Participants IG receive story-centred care intervention program week 4 week ; CG receive health consultation researcher week 4 week . Story-centred care intervention program Participants randomise IG make participate 4-week long story-centred care intervention program conduct train researcher . A trained researcher facilitate six-step intervention . Step 1 involves gather story complicate health challenge participant . investigator guide participant describe health challenge use element story . The challenge include current health problem , past experience relate problem expectation deal problem . During Step 2 , connection health challenge exist literature make story reconstruct . In order ensure health challenge true reflection participant ' condition , investigator identifies complicate health challenge participant exist literature help revise story identify important influential health challenge . Step 3 determines key moment health challenge understand participant ' feeling challenge . Step 4 involves accept story episode , record consolidated theme entire story . In Step 5 , researcher guide participant describe approach motivate him/her resolve exist health challenge . In Step 6 , participant encourage resolve challenge generate new meaning life improve overall well-being . During process , researcher interfere ask question help participant clarify vague part health story . Health consultation control condition Participants randomise control group receive health consultation train researcher week 4 week . The health consultation tailor participant ' need . Based previous study , health consultation include pain management , healthy nutrition , make best use medical service education counsel individual health-related concern . Statistical analysis The investigator use descriptive statistic ( mean , standard deviation , frequency percentage ) analyse participant characteristic primary outcome . Mann-Whitney U test use examine continuous variable group chi-square test ( Fisher 's Exact test appropriate ) use examine categorical variable group . Generalised estimate equation ( GEE ) use examine effect story-centred care intervention program improvement depression , cognitive function , quality life , blood pressure HRV . The SPSS 21.0 software package , Chinese version , use analyse data . All test two-tailed α &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant . Sample size calculation Sample size estimate use repeated-measures MANOVA approach , within-between interaction G*power 3.0.10 power = 0.8 , type 1 error α = 0.05 effect size η2 = 0.43 . We require sample size 64 ( 32 per group ) rise 70 account 10 % loss follow-up . Outcomes measurement Primary outcome 15-item geriatric depression scale test ( GDS-15 ) : The GDS-15 test ass depressive symptom . The GDS-15 test self-administered questionnaire yes/no response . This study use Chinese version GDS-15 test . A high score indicate severe depression sensitivity 70.6 % specificity 70.1 % old adult . Secondary outcome The short portable mental status questionnaire ( SPMSQ ) : The SPMSQ assess disorientation , personal profile , short- long-term memory compute ability . The number incorrect answer indicate level cognitive function . This study use Chinese version SPMSQ . To suit context study , item delete , result 10-item questionnaire score follow : 0-2 , intact cognitive function ; 3-4 , mild cognitive impairment ≥5 , moderate severe cognitive impairment . The test-retest reliability Chinese SPMSQ old adult 0.714 . Heart rate variability ( HRV ) : HRV measure use CheckMyHeart handheld HRV device ( DailyCare BioMedical Inc. , Chungli , Taiwan ) , limb-lead ECG ( modify lead I ) recorder HRV analytical software . It CE certify several country ( US , Canada , Japan Taiwan ) use previous study . The investigator make use HRV time-domain parameter standard deviation normal-to-normal interval ( SDNN ) root mean square successive difference ( RMSSD ) outcome variable , strongly associate psychological measure frequency domain . WHO Quality Life-BREF ( WHOQOL-BREF ) : The WHOQOL-BREF include 26 question cover four domain : physical health , psychological health , social relationship , environment . Two item add Taiwanese version order reflect Taiwanese cultural difference , bring total number item 28 . The two question 'Do participant feel respect others ? ' 'Are participant usually able get food ( i.e . lack availability ) participant like ? ' Each item score 1 5 , high score , great perceive quality life . Scores transform linearly 28-140 possible range mean scale score calculate . Cronbach 's alpha 0·69 subscales ( range 0·69-0·87 ) 0·93 whole scale present study .</detailed_description>
