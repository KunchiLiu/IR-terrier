	<brief_summary>The study compare novel volumetric method ( perform Aerogen Solo vibrate mesh nebulizer ) standard two-minute tidal breathing protocol ( perform Wright jet nebulizer ) methacholine challenge test . The result give indication whether novel technique accurately assess give dose methacholine new Aerogen Solo device . In addition , reproducibility test result method examine . Altogether , finding investigation may provide mean good standardization current test guideline .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Investigation Novel Procedure Methacholine Challenge Testing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fifteen asthmatic recruit tested University Saskatchewan randomize , two-way crossover study . Two test methodology perform , volumetric method Aerogen Solo nebulizer two-minute tidal breathing method Wright nebulizer . Participants undergo four methacholine challenge plus screen methacholine challenge . However , screen omit participant complete methacholine challenge last six month . Of four study challenge , two utilize Wright nebulizer two-minute tidal breathing method outline 1999 American Thoracic Society Guidelines Methacholine Challenge Testing . The remain two challenge utilize Aerogen Solo nebulizer volumetric method . The timing spirometric manoeuvers duration inhalation cycle consistent test method . Each challenge stop participant 's forced expiratory volume 1 second ( FEV1 ) drop least 20 % . This allow determination aPC20 ( provocative concentration methacholine cause 20 % fall FEV1 ) , convert aPD20 ( provocative dose ) . A minimum 24-hour washout period challenge use .</detailed_description>
