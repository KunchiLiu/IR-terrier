	<detailed_description>Transient Tachypnea Newborn ( TTN ) common diagnose disease state neonatal respiratory distress . However adequate method diagnose rule TTN . In several study pulmonary artery Doppler index investigate possible indicator pulmonary function . As result study , physiological process fetal lung maturation establish ; pulmonary tissue impedance resistance decrease increase gestational age , lead increase pulmonary blood flow . In normal lung maturation process peak sistolic velocity reach midsystole , case reason disturb nornal development process , peak occurs earlier . We suggest TTN , factor increase pulmonary tissue impedance like respiratory distress syndrome ( RDS ) pulmonary hypoplasia , would change pulmonary artery ( PA ) Doppler index , thus way evaluate pulmonary artery Doplerr index , could predict possible diagnosis TTN</detailed_description>
