	<brief_summary>Head neck cancer ( HNC ) 6th common cancer worldwide . In last decade , make substantial improvement diagnosis , stag treatment HNC . The overall survival improve , subgroup unchanged therefore new prognostic surveillance method warrant . One hallmark cancer ability invade surround tissue metastasize . Studies show urokinase proteolytic plasminogen activator ( uPA ) receptor ( uPAR ) present front invasive tumor consider essential cancer invasion metastasis . Consequently , uPAR-targeted tracer offer promise target functional PET imaging may stronger prognostic marker compare routine FDG-PET/CT . We wish clarify uPAR-PET/CT correlate patient outcome compare routine FDG-PET/CT patient HNC pharynx , larynx oral cavity , refer curative intend radiotherapy . In project participant uPAR-PET/CT scan perform initiation routine radiotherapy prognostic efficacy determine assessment recurrence rate mortality routine clinical follow-up .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Trial : uPAR-PET/CT Prognostication Head- Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study include patient head neck cancer ( HNC ) uPAR-PET/CT scan perform initiation curative intend radiotherapy . After radiotherapy treatment patient attend routine clinical follow-up programme Rigshospitalet follow loco-regional control , sign metastasis overall survival . These relapse- survival parameter correlate SUVmax , SUVmean TNM stage obtain uPAR scan compare finding routine FDG scan clarify tracer strong prognostic marker HNC . If previous tissue sample take tumour patient enters study uPAR immunohistopathology tissue sample compare uPAR-PET/CT finding . We perform biopsy tissue sample study .</detailed_description>
