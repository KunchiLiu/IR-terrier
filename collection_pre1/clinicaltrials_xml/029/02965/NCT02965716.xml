	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well talimogene laherparepvec pembrolizumab work treat patient stage III-IV melanoma . Biological therapy , talimogene laherparepvec , use substance make live organism may stimulate suppress immune system different way stop tumor cell grow . Monoclonal antibody , pembrolizumab , may interfere ability tumor cell grow spread . Giving talimogene laherparepvec pembrolizumab may work well treat patient melanoma shrink tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Talimogene Laherparepvec Pembrolizumab Treating Patients With Stage III-IV Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate durable response rate treatment talimogene laherparepvec ( T-VEC ) combination pembrolizumab follow progression prior anti-PD-1 anti-PD-L1 therapy alone combination agent different T-VEC . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate objective response rate ( confirm unconfirmed , complete partial response ) inject lesion . II . To estimate objective response rate ( ORR ) non-visceral , non-injected lesion . III . To estimate objective response rate ( ORR ) visceral lesion ( Cohort A ) . IV . To estimate overall objective response rate ( ORR ) . V. To estimate median progression-free survival ( PFS ) . VI . To estimate median overall survival ( OS ) . VII . To evaluate toxicity regimen . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate whether add T-VEC PD1 blockade increase T-cell infiltration tumor whether change T-cell infiltration associate response . II . To evaluate whether add T-VEC PD1 blockade increase T-cell receptor ( TCR ) clonality tumor peripheral blood whether increase TCR clonality associate response . III . To evaluate whether intra-tumoral injection T-VEC associate tumor immune microenvironment . IV . To evaluate whether tumor mutational load mutation IFN pathway associate response T-VEC plus pembrolizumab therapy anti-PD1/L1 therapy refractory melanoma patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive talimogene laherparepvec intralesionally ( IL ) pembrolizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 18 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 2 year annually total 5 year .</detailed_description>
