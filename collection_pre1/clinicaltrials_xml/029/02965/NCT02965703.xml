	<brief_title>Aspirin Preventing Colorectal Cancer Patients With Colorectal Adenoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To test equivalency two aspirin schedule . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate effect aspirin treatment ratio cell proliferation ( Ki-67 ) /apoptosis ( TUNEL ) rectal biopsy . II . To evaluate effect aspirin treatment ratio cell proliferation ( Ki-67 ) /necroptosis ( MLKL ) rectal biopsy . III . To evaluate effect aspirin treatment fecal occult blood test ( measure adverse event ) measure stool sample . IV . To evaluate effect aspirin treatment methylation biomarkers gene ( i.e . CDKN2A [ cell cycle regulation ] , MGMT [ DNA repair ] , DAPK1 [ apoptosis ] , CDH1 [ cell invasion ] , WNT16 [ Wnt pathway ] RASSF1 [ RAS signal ] ) involve colorectal carcinogenesis , measure rectal biopsy . V. To evaluate effect aspirin treatment colorectal mucosal nanoscale cellular structural change measure PWS ( partial wave spectroscopy ) obtain rectal brushing . VI . To evaluate effect aspirin treatment abundance E. coli Fusobacterium rectal swab . VII . To evaluate effect aspirin arm may modify dietary intake calcium measure Food Frequency Questionnaire ( FFQ ) . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 3 arm . ARM I : Patients receive aspirin orally ( PO ) daily 12 week . ARM II : Patients receive aspirin PO daily week 1-3 7-9 placebo PO daily week 4-6 10-12 . ARM III : Patients receive placebo PO daily 12 week . After completion study , patient follow 6 month .</detailed_description>
