	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine maternal hyperoxygenation effective treatment fetal leave heart hypoplasia versus room air ( placebo ) . This determine measure well baby 's heart valves surround tissue grow function . In addition investigator examine brain growth use fetal ultrasound MRI , MRI child 's brain born determine great neonatal brain maturity mother receive oxygen compare fetuses mother receive placebo .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Birth defect lead cause infant mortality United States , congenital heart disease lead cause birth-defect related infant mortality . Despite advance , condition relate left heart hypoplasia ( LHH ) severe , contribute significantly overall mortality well morbidity , include delay brain maturation . Conditions involve leave heart hypoplasia ( LHH ) among severe , contribute significantly overall mortality . Sequelae limit mortality , recurrent intervention impair neurodevelopmental outcome highly prevalent among survivor LHH . During last 15 year , fetal cardiac intervention ( FCI ) introduce novel treatment child . The potential halt disease progression utero avoid reduce complexity future surgery allure . Current FCI highly invasive , limited controversial data pertain efficacy , risk , criterion intervention . There also group fetuses LHH require neonatal intervention , may include single ventricle palliation , candidate current FCI . The investigator intend use randomize control pilot study design evaluate novel non-invasive FCI improve leave heart growth fetus LHH . The intervention chronic administration supplemental oxygen provide pregnant subject ( maternal hyperoxygenation , MH ) versus placebo . Currently , two FCIs available left-sided disease , invasive carry significant risk . The intervention include aortic valvuloplasty aortic stenosis atrial septoplasty/stenting hypoplastic leave heart syndrome restrictive intact atrial septum . While tremendous enthusiasm procedure , limited controversial data pertain efficacy , risk , inclusion criterion intervention . There also group patient LHH without frank aortic stenosis hypoplasia multiple leave heart structure . While patient almost universally require neonatal intervention may include single ventricle palliation , candidate fetal intervention currently available . This population fetuses intend target . The etiology leave heart obstruction unknown , although common pathway think diminish blood flow leave heart structure utero . Hypothesized etiology include abnormal restricted PFO flow , reduce flow across mitral valve atrial septal aneurysm , low aortic flow due aortic valvar abnormality , presence ventricular septal defect , subaortic narrowing . In fetus , maternal blood high oxygen glucose concentration deliver via umbilical , travels via ductus venosus right atrium , majority cross foramen ovale pass leave heart . Most blood use perfuse develop brain . In normal fetal heart , 10 % leave heart output , rather travel cerebral circulation , pass aortic isthmus join blood perfuse low body . The low volume blood flow fetal lung due high pulmonary vascular resistance . The fetal pulmonary circulation sensitive small change pulmonary arterial oxygen saturation tension . Pulmonary vascular response change oxygen level much relate gestational age sensitivity increase dramatically advancing gestational age fetus . It show fetal sheep human fetus supplemental oxygen provide gravid mother , evidence increase fetal pulmonary blood flow , response becomes pronounce late gestation . This increase pulmonary blood flow result great blood flow leave atrium , potentially leave ventricle across aorta . From January 2013 March 2014 , investigator conduct pilot feasibility study CMH mother fetuses LHH define combine aortic &amp; mitral valve annulus z-score ( AMZ ) less -4.5 . The investigator recruit gravidae moderate severe hypoplasia leave heart structure growth potential still exist ; therefore gravidae fetal hypoplastic leave heart syndrome severe aortic stenosis exclude . Candidates challenge follow : After full fetal echocardiogram room air , Doppler scan repeat 10 minute maternal hyperoxygenation 8 LPM 100 % FiO2 . Responders ( fetuses great 10 % increase aortic/combined cardiac output ) offer enrollment . Nine gravidae enrol . Chronic MH consist minimum 8 hour daily oxygen delivery . Enrolled gravidae compare retrospective control , care institution January 2013 March 2014 fetal LHH undergoing CMH ( 9 total ) . Rate growth aortic mitral annulus compare among group use longitudinal regression . All mother tolerate CMH , significant maternal fetal complication . Mean increase percent aortic flow acute maternal hyperoxygenation 35.3 % ( range 18.1-47.9 % ) . Mean daily CMH hour = 10 ( range 6.5-14.6 ) . Mitral annular growth 0.19 mm/week compare 0.14 mm/week CMH vs. control ( p=0.33 ) . Aortic annular growth 0.14 mm/week compare 0.13 mm/week CMH vs. control ( p=0.75 ) . More 9 CMH hour daily associate well growth aortic annulus intervention fetus ( 0.16 mm/week vs. 0.08 mm/week , p=0.014 ) . In pilot study , CMH appear safe feasible , although effect estimate annular growth small give studied method delivery dose oxygen . Given finding , investigator determine CMH therapy investigate low risk intervention fetal LHH . The current study design pilot randomize controlled trial , change route dose oxygen illustrate . Purpose Objectives The investigator aim perform pilot randomize control trial investigate novel fetal cardiac intervention continuous supplemental oxygen ( maternal hyperoxygenation MH ) mother fetuses left heart hypoplasia ( LHH ) . It show acute MH , evidence increase fetal pulmonary blood flow result great blood flow leave atrium , leave ventricle across aorta . There evidence chronic MH ( CMH ) fetuses hypoplastic leave heart structure may improve growth left heart , although study include control patient . CMH also potential attenuate prenatal cerebral change think secondary abnormal cerebral blood delivery fetuses LHH resultant poor maturation fetal brain . For pilot study , investigator intend compare CMH placebo therapy 12 mother determine effect estimate large , multicenter randomize control trial ( RCT ) trial . The team recently complete feasibility pilot 9 mother receive CMH therapy . While significant maternal fetal complication , result promise , effect estimate small control retrospective , randomize , limit interpretability effect . Aim 1 : To determine chronic MH therapy mother fetuses left heart hypoplasia result faster growth fetal mitral aortic annulus compare fetuses mother receive placebo . Methods &amp; approach : Recruitment include mother fetus LHH . Enrollees wear nasal cannula 4 LPM flow 40 % FiO2 oxygen room air 24 hours/day . Fetuses follow echocardiography delivery , echocardiogram birth , care clinically indicate . Rates change left-sided valve annular dimension CMH group vs. placebo compare , use longitudinal regression . Aim 2 : To determine chronic MH therapy mother fetuses left heart hypoplasia result great neonatal brain maturity compare fetuses mother receive placebo . Methods &amp; approach : Recruitment , enrollment , intervention identical delineate , patient . For aim , tbrain maturity fetus expose MH versus placebo compare use neonatal brain magnetic resonance imaging , define well-known maturation score . CMH fetal LHH potential major impact field congenital heart disease , noninvasive , inexpensive , universally available . Other institution United States Canada demonstrate eagerness join multicenter RCT pilot suggest positive result .</detailed_description>
