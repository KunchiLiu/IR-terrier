	<detailed_description>Background Rationale : Headaches follow mild traumatic brain injury ( mTBI ) common , refractory standard therapy , may persist worsen become debilitate chronic pain syndrome . The purpose study evaluate centrally act alpha-1 adrenoreceptor ( AR ) antagonist drug prazosin prophylactic treatment chronic posttraumatic headache ( PTHAs ) . The impetus study come large open-label case series Iraq Afghanistan Veterans mTBI PTHAs data placebo-controlled trial evaluate use prazosin posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) active-duty Servicemembers ( SMs ) . Findings study show addition decrease PTSD-related symptom improve sleep quality , prazosin decrease frequency severity headache , common study population . Study Objectives , Specific Aims , Hypotheses : The objective study evaluate efficacy prazosin prophylactic treatment persistent PTHAs , accomplish conduct randomized placebo-controlled double blind trial prazosin vs. placebo active-duty SMs Veterans military service time October 7 , 2001 present persistent PTHAs . - Specific Aim 1 : To determine effect prazosin compare placebo headache frequency , headache severity duration , use abortive/analgesic medication , headache-related disability . - Specific Aim 2 : To determine effect prazosin sleep disturbance , PTSD symptom , depressive symptom , alcohol consumption , global cognitive function , health-related quality life , global clinical status .</detailed_description>
