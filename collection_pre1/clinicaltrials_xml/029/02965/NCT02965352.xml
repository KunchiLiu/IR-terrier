	<brief_title>Peripheral Quantify Strength Children Functional During Pinch Movement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Since childhood , necessary produce sufficient force grip pinch , perform daily task independently ; therefore , measurement force end useful marker evaluate performance physical development child . It develop peripheral contain three device instrument analyze force applied execution cylindrical grip movement , pinch pulp-side pinch pulp-pulp different situation daily life volunteer . The data acquisition interface develop software data recording . For peripheral functionality test , thirty volunteer gender select . They also student Sports Secretary , motor abnormality , seven ten year old .</detailed_description>
