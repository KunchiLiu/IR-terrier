	<brief_title>A Study Select Top-grade Embryo Time-lapse Imaging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . BACKGROUND : At present , embryo selection embryonic laboratory various reproductive center continue follow conventional morphological assessment base time period provide 2016 Expert Consensus Guidelines Laboratory Operations ( revise Istanbul consensus ) ( discussion board ) , insemination 1th-6th day ( except 4th day ) observe specific time point embryonic morphology , static observation , score , select embryo . This method observation embryonic development comprehensive enough , lack quantifiable recognize indicator . EmbryoScope Time-lapse culture system late development human assist reproductive embryo fertilization blastocyst development . The time-lapse imaging system ( TLI ) use record embryonic development process fertilization blastocyst formation . The timing change play key role developmental potential embryo , time emergence disappearance pronucleus , time early cleavage , cleavage pattern . At present , late 2016 Laboratory Operation Expert Consensus Guide ( discussion board ) provide grade standard objectively reflect specific information morphological change , cleavage pattern , specific time morphological change , embryonic development post- Determine fate embryo play vital role . Due clinical diagnosis treatment center standard , laboratory culture system , difference laboratory standard operation procedure , embryonic development speed difference . Therefore , desirable use EmbryoScope Time-lapse culture system find best time morphological change embryos accordance laboratory culture system basis expert consensus time period . To establish evaluation model embryo morphology kinetics suitable laboratory . Embryology time-of-flight monitoring Morphological kinetics evaluation model suitable patient vitro fertilization/ intracytoplasmic sperm injection , especially infertile woman assist reproduction , woman repeat transplantation failure , woman fertility disorder require egg activation , Single embryo transfer patient , effectively avoid multiple pregnancy , reduce risk multiple pregnancy . Selection embryos developmental potential transplantation , improve embryo quality , improve accuracy embryo selection , contribute successful pregnancy . But also alleviate part patient 's mental stress , also contribute successful pregnancy . At time , laboratory embryologist provide data reference , human embryonic development information . At present , several large-scale center undergo embryo laboratory kinetics score model . Shanshan Wang et al suggest cleavage pattern embryos time parameter combine establish new embryo screening model single embryo transfer embryo , obtain ideal pregnancy outcome . EmbryoScope Time-lapse culture system embryo selection , compare traditional culture system static morphology embryo selection , EmbryoScope Timelapse selection transplant embryo , clinical pregnancy rate [ 3 ] , EmbryoScope Time-lapse culture system , Significantly improve . The literature N. Basile P. Vime [ 4 ] suggests blastocyst culture [ 10 ] plus choice embryo morphology kinetics may best treatment improve clinical outcome . Studies report , time difference image system interfere embryonic culture condition case interval 20 min , 5 min 1 min shoot image , continue first 3 day 5 day . In addition , TLI image acquisition system exclude abnormal cleave embryos consider `` normal '' developmental potential static assessment . A number study show TLI culture system combine morphological scoring method select embryo obtain transplantation compare purely morphological method choice static embryo satisfactory patient pregnancy outcomes . In study , compare clinical outcome patient two different culture route , analyze advantage TLI combine morphological scoring method , establish model embryonic time difference morphology kinetics laboratory . The aim study prospectively select embryo selective single embryo transfer , advanced infertility woman patient repeat graft failure improve clinical pregnancy rate reduce occurrence multiple birth . 2 . Trial design : Samples select accord inclusion criterion , group A B group accord random number table , 40-50 patient group . The random number table attach . In order avoid withdrawal patient reason suitable inclusion trial , researcher increase sample size , random number table increase 150 . A group patient oocytes inject human chorionic gonadotrophin ( HCG ) 38-40 hour intracytoplasmic sperm injection ( ICSI ) , ordinary three-gas incubator , conventional fertilization 4hours , demolition egg ordinary three-chamber , insemination .The embryo evaluate select current morphological scoring method . The oocyte Group B take ICSI infect HCG 38-40 hour . And place Time-Lapse . The ovary place Time-Lapse 4Hhours fertilization , embryos evaluate time-lapse imaging ( TLI ) . The cleavage pattern time parameter marker embryo development record daily insemination . ( 1 ) The rate high-quality embryo ( cleavage blastocyst stage ) , clinical pregnancy rate embryo implantation rate group A group B ; ( 2 ) The cleavage pattern time parameter embryo group B analyze retrospectively , And quality blastocyst analyze . Logistic regression analysis use establish criterion embryo selection . ( Age &gt; 38 year ) , patient recurrent graft failure ( number cycle ≥ 3 ) , development embryos part patient observe TLI.Results : ( 1 ) Embryonic development , Select high-quality embryo transplantation , observation pregnancy outcome . 3 . Statistical method : The data express mean ± standard deviation ( x ± ) rate ( % ) , data analyze Statistical Package Social Sciences 23.0 software . The quartile method use classify time parameter , advantage period parameter calculate outcome pregnancy high quality blastocyst formation . Logistic regression analysis clinical variable ( cleavage pattern time parameter ) relationship high-quality blastocyst , rate group compare use χ 2 test , P &lt; 0.05 difference statistically significant . 4 . Quality control quality assurance Patients manage list investigator adequate experience managing assist reproduction treatments.A Trial steer committee form oversee conduct trial . 5 . Data Handing record keep All data store three year . A desighnted research nurse responsible data management include data coding , monitor verification .</detailed_description>
