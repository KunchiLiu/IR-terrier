	<brief_title>Efficacy Intrathecal Versus Intravenous Dexmedetomidine Prevention Post Spinal Anesthesia Shivering</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Shivering frequent complication follow SA . It distress unpleasant experience patient . The incidence shivering report 36-85 % SA . It common TURP may due absorption large amount irrigate fluid room temperature . Shivering may occur response hypothermia . However , may also occur normothermic patient . SA impair thermoregulation system inhibit tonic vasoconstriction level anesthesia sympathetic somatic neural blockade . With internal redistribution heat core peripheral compartment , loss thermoregulatory vasoconstriction result increase heat loss body surface excess metabolic heat production . Excessive shiver result increase oxygen demand 400 % normal induce metabolic derangement hypoxemia , lactic acidosis hypercarbia . Therefore , shiver may cause problem patient low cardiac pulmonary reserve . Considering undesirable consequence shiver , measure prevent postoperative period important . Various drug investigate prevention treatment postoperative shivering , include meperidine , ketamine , tramadol , doxapram dexmedetomidine . Dexmedetomidine α 2-agonist decrease vasoconstriction shiver threshold administer meperidine additively reduce shiver threshold healthy volunteer . Intraoperative dexmedetomidine reduces postanesthetic shiver meperidine surgery . One bolus dose dexmedetomidine 1 μg/kg without continuous infusion use previous antishivering study . Dexmedetomidine also sedative analgesic effect postoperative period . Patients receive intraoperative injection dexmedetomidine sedate surgery receive placebo . This disadvantage particularly patient undergo outpatient surgery . Addition intrathecal dexmedetomidine heavy bupivacaine 0.5 % advantageous fentanyl special regard analgesic property diabetic surgical patient . Few study do evaluate efficacy intrathecal dexmedetomidine attenuation prevention shiver TURP . We aim compare efficacy intrathecal versus intravenous dexmedetomidine attenuation prevention shiver TURP spinal anesthesia randomize control trial .</detailed_description>
