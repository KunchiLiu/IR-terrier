This research establish overview daily life experience diagnose HGG caregiver . Descriptions need preference time diagnosis one year exist . However , data still lack representation long-term survivor ( LTS ) caregiver . This mixed method study aim address perspective daily life experience long-term survivor HGG caregiver well need preference support , rehabilitation palliation . Separate telephone interview patient caregiver self-reported questionnaire patient conduct . The mixed method design convergent sequential design use identical sampling .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The dominant status relies qualitative data interview emphasize best suit method address primary aim study . The interview follow semi-structured interview guide patient caregiver . Information socio-economic condition , disease treatment variable obtain investigator baseline . Disease , treatment clinical variable collect include World Health Organization ( WHO ) performance scale ( PS ) obtain medical chart review . The self-reported questionnaire ( quantitative data ) view useful supplemental data source , embrace topic distress , anxiety depressive symptom . Theoretical Framework The qualitative quantitative research component represent different paradigmatic tradition include diverse ontological , epistemological methodological assumption . However , paradigms necessarily incompatible . This study apply pragmatic paradigm , reflect pluralistic view use inductive deductive reasoning . Applying qualitative perspective , present interview seek capture subjective experience study participant related life situation . Analysis The semi-structured interview record transcribed full length interviewer . Interview data transfer NVivo 10 ( qualitative data analysis computer software package ) software program . A thematic analysis conduct analysis semi-structured interview . Thematic analysis basic method qualitative analysis identifies , analyze report theme pattern within data . The finding present theme subthemes . A theme expression context define important researcher . In study theme necessarily dependent quantifiable measure , rather capture important mean relation research question aim . Data interview descriptive nature reflect subjective experience life situation patient HGG caregiver . The step thematic analysis inspire Braun Clarke follow ; Step 1 ) Data transcribe immediately interview investigator research assistant . Transcriptions read several time investigator familiar depth extent content . This process guide investigator next level analysis . Step 2 ) The text read divide unit meaning , identify investigator . Some mean unit sentence , others whole paragraph . In process data cod order organize meaningful group . This process assure whole dataset systematically work investigator . Step 3 ) Then , code analyze order consider different code combine mutual theme . This three step process result collection theme sub-themes . Statistical analysis The PS , The Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale ( HADS ) sub-scales , The Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy , General brain cancer ( FACT-G FACT-Br ) sub-scales responses ordinal item leisure time physical activity scale analyse separately . Socio-economic information data questionnaire enter database . The questionnaire analyze accord manual . Categorical variable report frequency percentage , continuous variable report mean standard deviation ( s.d . ) use significance level p\0.05 . HADS FACT-Br data refer normative value . The statistical analysis perform SAS ( Statistical Analysis System ) statistical software , version 9.3 .</detailed_description>
