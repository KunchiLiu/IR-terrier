	<detailed_description>The goal research study determine obtain personalized genetic information subject 's blood sample similar obtain tumor tissue sample , use information make treatment suggestion . As tumor sample difficult collect , hope able collect similar genetic information blood urine sample find tumor tissue . Ultimately , hope identify gene important cancer cell could potentially identify standard-of-care research-based recommendation therapy .</detailed_description>
