	<detailed_description>Malaria incidence increase two- three-folds past four decade , nearly half world 's population live region endemic malaria : In Asia , Africa , South America . A global annual estimate 300-500 clinical case malaria mortality range 1-2 million report , 90 % occur sub-Saharan Africa . In Cameroon , malaria remain number one public health problem one million five hundred case three thousand one hundred sixty two death health facility per year . Indeed , 45-50 % consultation , 23 % hospitalization 35 % death among child 5 year attributable malaria Early diagnosis treatment malaria remain acceptable strategy malaria control . Mortality rise approach three million malarial death year , large part increase resistance antimalarial drug . The emergence spread P. falciparum resistance conventional monotherapies chloroquine ( CQ ) , amodiaquine ( AQ ) , mefloquine ( MQ ) , sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine ( SP ) result request effective accessible antimalaria drug entire population live endemic area . In Cameroon , prior 2002 , CQ SP first second line antimalarial drug respectively . Studies conduct different ecological setting Cameroon reveal marked decline drug 67 % clinical failure CQ alone . This lead interim adoption AQ Ministry Public Health . A series randomise , open control trial reveal AQ still effective administer monotherapy combination SP since 10.2 % , 13.6 % 0 % clinical failure record AQ , SP SP+AQ respectively . However , study conduct Guinea Savannah show decline rate antimalarial drug clinical failure 40 % , 20 % , 13.6 % AQ , SP AQ+SP combination . Widespread resistance malaria parasite commonly available antimalaria drug necessitate country review deploy new antimalarial drug policy ensure effective case management . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) currently recommend artemisinin-based combination therapy ( ACTs ) best first-line treatment uncomplicated falciparum malaria , study ensure current regimen optimal incomplete . Artemisinine-based combination therapy ( ACTs ) prefer enhancement efficacy potential low malaria incidence rate resistance emerge spread\ . Due rapid clearance time , treat early case uncomplicated malaria ACTs may prevent progression severe malaria consequent reduction severe case malaria mortality rate . Although National Malaria Control Programme ( NMCP ) Cameroon adopt amodiaquine plus artesunate ( AQ+AS ) arthemether plus lumefantrine ( ART+LUM ) treatment uncomplicated malaria 2004 , local data support policy . In series subtrials constitute database anti-malarial drug efficacy Cameroon , AQ propose rational partner artesunate ; likewise , single arm study provide preliminary evidence safety efficacy AQ+AS low statistical power detect rare event PCR correction distinguish re-infection recrudescence . Meta-analysis study show ART-LUM highly effective safe twice daily dos ( total six dos ) administer supervision , concern six dos ART-LUM three day may reduce compliance . Nevertheless , relatively number patient complain physical fatigue ART-LUM treatment trial compare order ACTs . AS+AQ combination less expensive subsidized Cameroonian Government , believe cure rate may lower ART-LUM parasite resistance AQ , inclusion ACTs likely go fail . In addition , minor , transient side effect AQ may lead poor compliance subsequent decline AQ efficacy . In Southeast Asia , P. falciparum drug-resistant world , three-day artesunate-mefloquine treatment generally prefer treatment uncomplicated malarial infection . Studies Laos , suggest artesunate plus mefloquine ( AS-MQ ) ART-LUM combination effective superior CQ plus SP treatment uncomplicated falciparum malaria . However , ASMQ limit high cost , frequency adverse effect associate mefloquine , lack formulation combine antimalarial single tablet . In addition , reduce efficacy artesunate-mefloquine report recently southeastern border Thailand . Artemether plus lumefantrine few adverse effect also relatively expensive . A global analysis series randomize study anti-malarial treatment efficacy conduct Cameroon 2003 2007 ART-LUM effective ACT treatment failure due recrudescence ( 98.3 % cure rate PCR correct ) , follow dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine 92.7 % cure rate . After PCR adjustment , 28 day cure rate 91.7 % AS-SP 88.7 % artesunate-amodiaquine , 76 % artesunate-chlorproguanil-dapsone . Clinical trial Cambodia Vietnam suggest dihydroartemisinin plus piperaquine ( DHA+PQ ) combination highly effective P. falciparum parasites adverse effect child adult . In Cambodia , 28-days cure rate 98.6 % child 92.3 % adult Vietnam , use dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine-trimethoprim combination , 56-days cure rate child adults 97-98 % ( Tran et al. , 2004 ) . In addition , relatively inexpensive compare ACTs , 1 $ US per treatment course ( Mutabingwa et al. , 2005 ) . Therefore demonstrate DHA-PQ effective antimalaria Cameroon , few adverse effect comparison AS-MQ ART-LUM , may alternative treatment available Government Cameroon advantage coformulated available low cost ACTs . In order determine comparative efficacy adverse effect profile antimalaria Cameroon , investigator propose carry open randomise comparative clinical trial combination oral arthemether plus lumefantrine ( ART+LUM ) artesunate plus mefloquine ( AS+MQ ) versus dihydroartemisinine plus piperaquine ( DHA+PQ ) combination treatment uncomplicated malaria . Primary objective : The objective study compare efficacy , safety tolerability orally administer arthemether plus lumefantrine ( ART+LUM ) , artesunate plus mefloquine ( AS+MQ ) dihydroartemisinin plus piperaquine ( DHA+PQ ) combination treatment uncomplicated falciparum malaria Cameroon order provide evidence use determine optimum antimalaria treatment policy Cameroon . Secondary objective : - To valuate efficacy safety artemether plus lumefantrine ( ART + LUM ) artesunate plus mefloquine ( AS + MQ ) versus dihydroartemisinin plus piperaquine ( DHA + PQ ) combination - To compare clearance asexual parasites gametocyte treatment group - To assess clearance fever - To assess effect treatment arm anemia STUDY SITE AND DESIGN It randomize clinical trial compare efficacy oral dihydroartemisinin plus piperaquine artemether plus lumefantrine artesunate mefloquine combination . The formulation test unilateral ( Null hypothesis : DHA +PQ = ART+LUM DHA + PQ = AS + MQ ; Alternative hypothesis : DHA +PQ &gt; ART+LUM DHA + PQ &gt; AS + MQ ) The trial conduct typical forest rainfall area locate south-western Region Cameroon . Patients recruit outpatient pediatric unit satellite clinic reference hospital Cameroon Development Corporation ( CDC ) administration , October 2012 March 2013 ELIGIBILITY - Inclusion criterion : The inclusion criterion ; signs/symptoms uncomplicated malaria include axillary temperature ≥ 37.5 ; monoinfection Plasmodium falciparum ; parasite count 2000 200 000 per μl ; haemoglobin level &gt; 5 g/dL ; absence signs/symptoms severe malaria disease require drug antimalaria antihistaminic activity ; parent/guardian willingness give consent - Exclusion criterion : Exclusion patient follow criterion ; Chronic disease ( HIV , malnutrition etc . ) , severe malaria , severe anaemia ( haemoglobin level &lt; 5 g/dL ) , respiratory distress , inability drink , convulsion etc. , history allergie test drug ; co-infection require drug antihistaminic antimalaria activity cotrimoxazole SAMPLING AND SAMPLE SIZE : The minimum participant per arm calculate 50 order detect reduction fever least 12 hr , standard deviation 18 , α β value set 0.05 .
