	<brief_summary>A cross-sectional descriptive study , surface electromyographic activity five shoulder muscle compare three population : old adult , middle-aged adult young adult . The evaluation electromyographic data offer suitable foundation understand age process . This support surface electromyography provide information age shoulder muscle . Loss functionality suffer high percentage old adult , greatly limit physical activity . In sense , paper present finding might relate possible therapeutic approach subsequent study .</brief_summary>
