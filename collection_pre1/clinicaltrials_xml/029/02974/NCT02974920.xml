	<brief_title>Rivaroxaban Aspirin Biological Aortic Prosthesis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background The study comparison aspirin rivaroxaban postoperative treatment biological aortic valve replacement . Scientific Background Guidelines year recommend anticoagulation aspirin surgical replacement aortic valve prosthesis . There proper randomized trial . Rivaroxaban anticoagulant approve several indication . The investigator conduct study compare Aspirin versus Rivaroxaban prevention thrombosis 6 month aortic valve replacement biological prosthesis . As substudy CT scan subgroup patient detect partially immobilized valve due thrombosis perform . Trial drug The trial drug 100 mg Aspirin daily 10 mg Rivaroxaban daily . Patients provide either 180 tablet 10 mg rivaroxaban 180 tablet 100 mg aspirin . Methodology This study plan multicenter , randomize , open label , parallel group study . Patients allocate aspirin rivaroxaban treat 6 month . Treatment period trial driven leave discretion investigator . As indicated study plan include 1000 patient . The steer committee may review recruitment rate overall event rate ( blind treatment ) may increase sample size 2000 patient . Another important aspect study follow-up mainly register . This group patient case receive treatment similar test trial systematic follow-up cardiology clinic . Therefore systematic follow-up direct trial keep minimum information follow-up obtain register . Randomisation For patient provide informed consent web-based case record form complete demographic data , data regard heart disease , comorbidity , medication time study start . Randomisation perform computerized algorithm vary block size stratification operate center . The specific treatment patient open provide computer patient randomise . Patients consider enrolled study sign informed consent . All patient sign consent account study report . In term primary intention treat analysis patient part analysis take first tablet either aspirin rivaroxaban . An analysis include patient provide informed consent sensitivity analysis . The early time study start postoperatively removal temporary pacemaker electrode . This anticipated day operation . Study start 2 week later anticoagulation intermediate period low molecular weight heparin and/or aspirin . Follow-up Study staff contact patient 3 6 month telephone ensure compliance obtain report event include adverse event . Study end The study end 6 month . The final contact study staff telephone . There guideline indicate anticoagulation necessary patient direct valve operation recommend treatment patient follow-up direct control . Follow-up register continue study end . There preplanned analysis outcome treatment allocation 2 year . Statistical analyse The primary comparison log-rank test time select outcome . Supportive analysis use Cox proportional hazard model . For analysis superiority either drug 2 side p-value 0.05 use . The conclusion superiority base main endpoint . A statistical analysis plan prepare prior study closure . The main analysis make accord intention treat principle patient take least one tablet examine main analysis . In addition analysis make patient censored stop study medication . Sample size : Access nationwide register employ . A total 2345 patient treat aspirin 4509 treat warfarin operation identify . Analysis perform 30 day 180 day avoid conditioning future . It note procedure likely underestimate power study . The 30-180 day primary event rate aspirin group 7.5 % event rate warfarin group 3.2 % . Based observation CPOWER function R-HMisc package use calculate power 81 % base 500 simulation . Safety Management A Data Safety Monitoring Board statistical , cardiological surgical expertise follow study . Formal interim analysis plan . This committee compose member otherwise independent study . They recommend steer committee discontinue study , body course study receive unblinded result group treatment . As individual patient investigator may discontinue study treatment bleed observed otherwise indicate . There trial specific rule handle side effect trial . CT substudy A CT substudy 580 patient conducted investigate effect postprocedural medical regime leaflet motion aortic bioprosthesis . These patient follow normal course trial CT scan aortic valve perform 3 12 month . Patients consecutively invite substudy require sample size meet . Primary end-point • The proportion patient least one prosthetic leaflet &gt; 50 % motion reduction assess cardiac 4DCT-scan ( total N = 580 ) . Secondary end-points • The proportion prosthetic leaflet &gt; 50 % motion reduction assess cardiac 4DCTscan ( total N = 1740 ) . • The proportion patient least one prosthetic leaflet thicken assessed cardiac 4DCT-scan ( total N = 580 ) . • The proportion prosthetic leaflet thicken assessed cardiac 4DCT-scan ( total N = 1740 ) . • Aortic transvalvular mean pressure gradient effective orifice area ( cm2 ) determine transthoracic echocardiography . • Functional NYHA class . • Death , first thromboembolic event ( DTE ) , safety endpoint assess main study analyse CT substudy regard occurrence leaflet abnormality . Definitions • Leaflet thickening : Hypoattentuating leaflet thicken focal hypoattenuating abnormality attach prosthetic leaflet diffuse thicken prosthetic valve leaflet identifiable least two reconstructed plane ( typically double-oblique axial multiplanar reformatted reconstruction ) . • Reduced motion : Reduced systolic leaflet excursion classify : ( I ) normal , ( II ) mildly reduce ( &lt; 50 % ) , ( III ) moderate severely reduce ( &gt; 50 % ) , ( IV ) immobile . Reduced systolic leaflet excursion consider significant &gt; 50 % immobile . Quantitative assessment leaflet motion perform blood pool inversion volume render cine reconstruction throughout cardiac cycle evaluate bioprosthetic leaflet . The primary endpoint reduce aortic bioprosthetic leaflet motion expect occur approximately 10 % patient . ( 15 ) Equal number patient warrant treatment group . A 65 % reduction rivaroxaban primary endpoint require inclusion 580 patient order demonstrate superiority . Taking account estimate loss follow-up 18 % patient , total sample size ( N ) need demonstrate superiority would 580 randomized patient . The primary endpoint analyse use exact Fisher test Χ2 test , require . Supporting analysis include logistic regression inclusion covariates . Sample size calculation ( Power 0.8 , Alpha 0.05 ) - Probability event Group A : 0.10 • Probability event Group B : 0.035 • Proportion sample Group A : 0.50 • Evaluable subject need Group A : 238 • Drop-out : 0.18 - N = 580 Estimation dropout rate • A 10 % loss follow-up death 3 month expect elderly patient population . • In approx . 8 % case , inconclusive cardiac 4DCT expect .
