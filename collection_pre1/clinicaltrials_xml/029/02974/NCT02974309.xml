	<detailed_description>Type 1 Diabetes ( T1DM ) one common chronic medical condition occur child . More two-thirds young patient struggle maintain optimal glycemic control . On seemingly unrelated front , insufficient sleep become public health crisis le 30 % youth achieve recommend number hour school night . Prior research support sleep disturbance contribute elevate glucose level significant impact memory , attention , plan . These skill essential effective diabetes management . Despite link sleep diabetes , research examine benefit intervention help youth achieve healthy sleep duration . To end , primary objective determine effect sleep extension glycemic control psychosocial functioning . Our secondary objective determine mediator moderator effect . The central hypothesis increase sleep duration lower glucose level improve behavioral rating ( internalize , externalize , classroom behavior ) . Our primary study aim ( 1 ) Test lengthen sleep improves glycemic control psychosocial function youth T1DM ; ( 2 ) Assess putative mechanism effect sleep extension glucose psychosocial function ; ( 3 ) Examine possible moderate effect pre-existing sleep parameter sociodemographic variable modify impact sleep extension . A secondary aim exploratory examine additional pre-selected mediator moderator . In propose randomized study , 175 youth T1DM assign Sleep Extension supportive routine condition . The Sleep Extension lengthen youth 's time bed allow healthy sleep duration consistent basis , whereas supportive routine condition reinforces daytime nighttime activity . We test impact sleep extension key index glycemic control ( average glucose level % time hyperglycemia use continuous glucose monitor HbA1C ) well putative mechanism effect ( e.g. , heart rate variability salivary cortisol level ) participant characteristic might mitigate benefit sleep extension ( e.g. , sleep-disordered breathing , adherence , SES ) . Once aim achieve causal link establish , propose Sleep Extension intervention advance knowledge role sleep diabetes management provide beneficial intervention help youth T1DM .</detailed_description>
