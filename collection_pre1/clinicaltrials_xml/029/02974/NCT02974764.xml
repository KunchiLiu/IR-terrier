	<brief_summary>Pancreatic adenocarcinoma ( PDAC ) fourth lead cause cancer mortality United States . The high mortality tumor primarily attribute late stage patient diagnose , lead dismal 5-year survival 6 % stage PDAC . Surgical resection offer best chance survival , patient present symptom tumor metastasize , result operative candidate . This create need identify patient early stage cancer still resectable , predict aggressiveness disease order well target treatment . In addition , even patient receive curative surgery high risk develop recurrence disease . Thus , also need detect recurrence early appropriate treatment provide . As several adjuvant chemotherapeutic regimen available , important identify soon possible cancer become refractory give therapy . This allow one progress second third line therapy quickly tumor burden small . This purpose study identify biomarkers blood patient PDAC determine change time relation treatment assess correlation patient outcome , response treatment , recurrence disease overall survival . This study limit patient present Johns Hopkins Hospital January 1 , 2015 December 31 , 2018 PDAC . Blood drawn consent patient time initial diagnosis treatment . Patients undergo treatment cancer base personal preference , standard guideline discussion medical , radiation , surgical oncologist . Patients undergo surgical resection also additional blood sample collect resection , patient undergo chemotherapy and/or radiation additional blood sample draw end treatment . A patient could blood collected multiple interval , i.e . pre-treatment sample , sample post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy/radiation , sample post-surgery , sample post-adjuvant chemotherapy/radiation . In patient , undergone curative resection PDAC blood sample collect till develop clinical recurrence disease . For first 2 year follow surgery sample collect every 3-4 month . Beyond investigator collect sample every 6 month next two year . For patient find alive disease free beyond 4 year surgery samples collect every year . These patient follow determine disease-free overall survival . With study , investigator aim assess potential utility blood biomarkers time pancreatic tumor help early detection disease also recurrence disease surgery . Biomarkers identify would potential create new method early diagnosis patient PDAC , predict overall survival , response treatment , risk metastatic spread , predict recurrence disease , potential drastically improve outcome deadly disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This single-institutional , prospective study Johns Hopkins Hospital conduct January 1 , 2015 December 31 , 2018 . All patient present Johns Hopkins Hospital pancreatic adenocarcinoma ( PDAC ) evaluation treatment chemotherapy , radiation therapy , and/or surgery approach participate study , consent study include . All patient consent participate trial blood drawn ( approximately 50 ml 3-4 tablespoon ) time diagnosis treatment administer . Further blood drawn treatment . For example , patient undergo surgical resection also blood draw resection prior discharge . Those patient undergo treatment chemotherapy , radiation therapy , biologic/vaccine therapy blood drawn treatment complete . If patient undergoes chemotherapy surgical resection , blood drawn chemotherapy surgical resection , surgical resection , addition pre-treatment blood sample ( see schema include IRB ) . For first 2 year follow surgery sample collect every 3-4 month . Beyond investigator collect sample every 6 month next two year . For patient find alive disease free beyond 4 year surgery samples collect every year . This blood store investigator ' research facility label de-identified code . If patient refuse blood draw time study loss follow-up , sample collect still utilize . The blood process day collection , within 6 hour draw . Twenty ( 20 ) ml blood , collect two purple top tube , use isolation circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) Isolation Size Epithelial Tumor Cells assay ( ISET ) , separate tumor cell size onto membrane use experiment . These 20 ml blood mixed ISET buffer per standard protocol filter ISET machine onto membrane . These membrane store -20 degree C de-identified number , remain condition several year full preservation cell . Further experiment do membrane , include immunofluorescent staining , laser capture microscopy , genetic analysis . The remain 30 ml blood , collect red purple top tube , process standard protocol within 6 hour collection . Blood double spun remove white blood cell , plasma frozen . Driver gene mutation characterize resected tumor monitor digital droplet Polymerase Chain Reaction ( ddPCR ) , include Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog ( k-ras ) , p53 , p16/cdkn2a Deleted Pancreatic Cancer-4 gene ( DPC4/SMAD4 ) identify presence ctDNA whether level rise . Data collect , de-identified analyzed single dataset Johns Hopkins Hospital . Data obtain patient electronic paper clinical chart John Hopkins Hospital start 1/1/2015 , data existence 1/1/2015 collect . More specifically , radiology , chemotherapy , operative pathology report , discharge summary , clinic note review data source collect . For patient lose follow-up , Social Security Death Index ( need collect social security number ) search evidence death . Collected patient data enter dedicated database . Data collect order correlate outcome tumor characteristic biomarkers identify study . Following data accrual prior analysis , personal identifier delete identifiable information present time statistical analysis . The subject data generate appear subject 's medical record use research purpose . The data record password-protected , secure database within Principal Investigator 's office accessible key personnel . After data particular subject collect , subject 's identity delete assure confidentiality . The data collect study use clinical management patient study . Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria The investigator include patient present Johns Hopkins Hospital treatment diagnosis pancreatic adenocarcinoma . Subjects include age 18 year old plan undergo treatment Johns Hopkins Hospital . All patient non-primary pancreas tumor , pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor , benign pancreatic mass exclude . Patients exclude already undergone treatment kind another institution . The investigator aim include data least 200 patient three year study . The primary outcome identify biomarkers blood patient pancreatic adenocarcinoma change biomarkers time relation treatment . These biomarkers include specific antibody , circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) circulate tumor DNA ( ctDNA ) . Secondary outcome include relationship pre-treatment biomarker level change biomarker level disease-free overall survival , risk metastasis , recurrence disease response treatment . Patient , tumor , surgical characteristic collect patient include study . Differences characteristic statistically compare patient . In addition , characteristic analyze possible predictor survival use univariate multivariate analysis log-rank test Cox-proportional hazard model . These characteristic include : 1 . Patient tumor clinical demographic include age , gender , race , primary tumor location , location metastasis , tumor grade , Carbohydrate Antigen 19-9 ( CA19-9 ) level pre- post-chemotherapy pre- post-resection . 2 . Chemotherapy variables include type , number cycle , response , timing ( neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant ) . 3 . Operative variable include type resection , number lymph node resect , vascular proximity tumor , histopathology , post-operative mortality complication . 4 . Long-term variable include presence location recurrence status ( alive/dead ) . 5 . Levels specific biomarkers various time point blood draw . 6 . Numbers circulate tumor cell time point addition genetic mutation present cell . For patient , overall survival calculate time date first pre-treatment blood draw date last known follow-up visit death , whichever come first . For patient undergo surgical resection investigator calculate time disease recurrence measure day surgery pancreatic resection date document disease recurrence death , whichever come first . Time disease recurrence overall survival describe Kaplan-Meier curve compare log-rank test . The 1- 5-year overall survival rate estimate 95 % confidence interval . Statistical significance set p-value 0.05 . The primary risk patient associate blood collection , minimal give collection venipuncture 50 ml take time . The general risk associate venous blood draw include bruise minor bleeding site venous puncture , would manage application pressure .
