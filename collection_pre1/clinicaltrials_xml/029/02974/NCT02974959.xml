	<brief_summary>The purpose single-center , prospective , randomize ( 1:1 ) , double-blind , sham-controlled parallel-arm pilot study provide initial evidence use noninvasive vagus nerve stimulator treatment patient recover concussion moderate traumatic brain injury improve clinical recovery . The study compare safety effectiveness active gammaCore treatment sham treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Our primary aim ass evidence effectiveness nVNS reduce clinical symptom motor cognition deficit . As primary endpoint , analyze difference group time point standardize cognitive assessment . We also assess level different inflammatory cytokine . The secondary endpoint moderate TBI functional assessment quality life questionnaire include depression screen . Our secondary aim ass safety non-invasive VNS ( nVNS ) subset patient suffer moderate TBI . We anticipate significant difference heart rate variability ( HRV ) active compare sham treatment difference symptom experience treatment session . We propose single-center , prospective , randomize ( 1:1 ) , double-blind , sham-controlled , parallel-arm pilot study . We determine N 30 patient would need reach significance . Moderate TBI define Head Injury Interdisciplinary Special Interest Group American Congress Rehabilitation Medicine ( full list inclusion criterion ) seek care HCMC within 2 week injury . Recruited subject randomize active treatment sham-treatment control arm . Randomization active sham gammaCore treatment occur screen visit enrollment , intervention begin baseline visit occur 72 hour ( +/- 1 day ) enrollment . Informed consent obtain patient proxy prior enrollment . If proxy elect enroll patient , recovers course study , able withdraw study desire . We anticipate enrollment take approximately 6 month , enrol subject follow final week 18 follow visit , estimate completion date 9 month first enrollment . The treatment include 12 week active interventional therapy , seven visit , include screen visit take place within 2 week injury . From baseline visit , follow phone call 1 week , follow visit 2 , 6 , 12 18 week . During visit , data assess heart rate variability obtain use chest strap heart rate monitor non-invasive heart rate variability monitor use measure minute phenomenon heartbeat . This do supine , treatment orthostatic challenge ( i.e . stand sit upright ) . An EKG obtain visit ass bradycardia . The nVNS therapy perform use gammaCore-R ( electroCore LLC , NJ ) , external hand-held vagal nerve stimulator . The gammaCore-R produce low voltage electric signal consist five 5000 Hz pulse repeat rate 25 Hz . The strength stimulation lower require activate efferent vagal nerve fiber mediate cardiac specific effect use leave vagus nerve , few cardiac projection . It allow 120 second stimulation session . The stimulation occur twice daily , one time morning one time evening . This do close 12 hour apart possible occur twice daily entire 12 week study period . The sham device appear identical gammaCore provide frequency stimulation powerful enough stimulate either efferent afferent fiber vagus nerve . However , supply low frequency current cause tingling skin improve blinding patient . After 12 week visit , device return . However , treat physician patient remain blind study arm completion study week 18 . Blood sample ( 10 mL two teaspoon ) draw screen visit , well 12 18-week time point biomarker analysis .</detailed_description>
