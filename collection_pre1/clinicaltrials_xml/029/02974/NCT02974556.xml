	<brief_summary>This study aim determine oncological effectiveness , compare standard surgical treatment , proactive management include target organ peritoneal spread resection ( omentectomy , bilateral adnexectomy , appendectomy , hepatic round ligament resection ) preventive HIPEC ( intraperitoneal oxaliplatin concomitant i.v . 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin ) follow curative resection high-risk ( &gt; /= 5 mm tumor invasion beyond muscularis propria ) T3 T4 colon cancer prevent development peritoneal metastasis . Adjuvant systemic chemotherapy reserve group patient poor prognostic factor accord Folinic acid/Fluorouracil/Oxaliplatin ( FOLFOX ) Capecitabine/Oxaliplatin ( CAPOX ) regimens . Hypothesis : The hypothesis compare standard treatment proactive management follow curative resection high-risk T3 T4 colon cancer reduce development endoperitoneal metastasis</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Colorectal cancer one leading cause cancer death develop country . Despite recent advance understand molecular pathogenesis improvement diagnosis treatment , 1,2 million new case 600,000 death occur annually worldwide cure rate remain low patient metastatic recurrent disease . According report National Cancer Institute , cancer colon highly treatable often curable disease confine bowel . Surgery primary treatment result cure rate approximately 50 % patient ; however , recurrence follow surgery major problem often ultimate cause death . In colon cancer locoregional recurrence ( local recurrence metachronous peritoneal spread ) , main site recurrence , less common ( 10 % recurrence ) generally occur within 3 year resection . An important concept origin local recurrence peritoneal metastasis common natural history . Specific feature primary tumor like size depth bowel wall invasion ( pT3-pT4 ) , determine specific clinical evolution ( obstruction , perforation exfoliation cancer cell ) responsible endoperitoneal recurrence . Cytoreductive Surgery ( CRS ) define removal macroscopic abdominal peritoneal disease combine Hyperthermic Perioperative Chemotherapy ( HIPEC ) treatment consider standard care select patient moderate small volume peritoneal metastasis secondary colorectal cancer . Nevertheless treatment locoregional recurrence peritoneal metastases colon cancer disappoint first 30 % patient surgically treat second 30 % 15- 30 % survive 5 year , leave 10 % patient chance cure . Furthermore economic burden metastatic colorectal cancer treatment considerable include common adverse event associated increase healthcare resource utilization consider addition biological drug standard treatment . An evaluation CRS combine HIPEC peritoneal metastasis colorectal origin era value-based medicine , show incremental cost respect modern chemotherapy regimens 44,217 US $ life-year save , make investment prevention even attractive . Despite screen colorectal cancer average-risk patient use colonoscopy associate substantially reduce risk diagnosis new-onset primary late-stage tumor , colorectal cancer screening remain underused . Analyzing recent surgical publish series , majority ( around 70 % ) , patient diagnosis colonic cancer operate curative intent , pT3-4 tumor , exactly high-risk class patient local recurrence peritoneal metastasis . In scenario effective strategy combat endoperitoneal recurrence seem prevention . Two previous study perform Institution investigate proactive management peritoneal metastases colon cancer patient consider high-risk peritoneal recurrence accord depth bowel wall invasion specific histopathologic feature ( pT3 , pT4 N , M0 , mucinous signet ring cell pathology ) influence outcome . A group 25 patient inclusion criterion verify intraoperative pathologic assessment , submit `` proactive '' treatment include addition standard surgical treatment , great omentectomy , appendectomy , exeresis liver round ligament , post-menopausal woman , bilateral oophorectomy . At end operation , patient HIPEC perform oxaliplatin simultaneous iv infusion 5-fluorouracil ( FU ) + leucovorin ( LV ) . Short long-term result show compare control group ( 50 case ) similar patient treated standard treatment Institution , group patient statistically significant decrease incidence peritoneal recurrence ( 4 vs. 28 % ) increase overall disease-free survival rate . These result obviously validate large controlled study , aim PROMENADE protocol , verify treatment criterion apply colorectal peritoneal metastasis ( Surgery combine HIPEC ) could represent mean tertiary prevention endoperitoneal recurrence high-risk colon cancer . However , simple application criterion need large-scale study . For reason histological typing yet consider inclusion criterion represent secondary outcome measure . Furthermore , also consider experience , protocol use imaging technique ( MDCT ) preoperative selection high-risk T3 ( &gt; /= 5 mm tumor invasion beyond muscularis propria ) T4 colon cancer , combine patient suspected systemic disease MDCT functional positron-emission tomography ( PET ) , avoid need intraoperative frozen-sections pathologic assessment . The result study hopefully confirm therapeutic rationale make microscopic local seed main reason endoperitoneal recurrence . It also important verify , demonstrate pilot study , good loco-regional control disease carry good long-term survival .</detailed_description>
