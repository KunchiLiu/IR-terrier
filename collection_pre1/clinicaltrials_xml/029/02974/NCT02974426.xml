	<brief_summary>Rationale : Completely resect non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) patient histologically confirm N2 disease heterogeneous population . After complete resection postoperative chemotherapy ( POCT ) , 20 % -40 % case risk locoregional recurrence ( LRR ) . Postoperative radiation therapy ( PORT ) integral component multidisciplinary treatment patient stage IIIA ( N2 ) disease . Postoperative Radiotherapy ( PORT ) -first strategy may advantage early administration locoregional therapy mediastinum , tumor burden presume higher systematic micrometastases . It yet know subset specific prognostic factor confer high LRR risk , optimal time PORT integrate POCT ( sequential fashion concurrent fashion ) PORT consider patient completely resect stage IIIA ( N2 ) NSCLC . Purpose : This randomized phase III trial study optimal time PORT evaluate whether PORT-first strategy ( PORT administer first concurrent subsequent POCT ) may effective PORT-last strategy ( PORT administer sequentially follow POCT ) treat high risk LRR patient completely resect pathologic stage IIIA ( N2 ) NSCLC .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>To Evaluate Optimal Timing Postoperative Radiotherapy Patients With IIIA ( N2 ) Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : 1 . Primary - Investigate optimal time PORT completely resect pathologic stage IIIa ( N2 ) NSCLC compare disease-free survival patient high risk LRR treat PORT-first vs PORT-last strategy . 2 . Secondary - Determine overall survival patient treat regimen . - Compare locoregional recurrence-free survival patient treat regimen . - Compare distant metastasis-free survival patient treat regimen . - Determine pattern failure patient treat regimen . - Determine toxicity , particular cardiac pulmonary toxicity , regimens patient . - Determine prediction model locoregional recurrence brain metastasis base clinical , pathological , radiological , genetic , tumor microenvironmental immunological data . OUTLINE : This multicenter , randomize study . The clinical risk prediction model LRR establish base large institutional database . On multivariate analysis , heavy cigarette smoke history , cN2 status , number involve lymph node &gt; 4 independently significant factor predict high risk LRR . The Prognostic Index ( PI ) equation build include three categorical variable coefficient base level significance : PI＝ ( 0.9×smoking history ) ＋ ( 0.5×clinical N status ) ＋ ( 0.8×number involve lymph node ) . Patients PI score≥3.5 consider high risk LRR . Patients stratify accord participate center , EGFR mutation status ( EGFR 19del 21L858R mutation v others ) , use pretreatment positron emission tomography scan ( yes v ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I ( PORT-first strategy ) : Concurrent chemoradiotherapy + sequential POCT PORT + sequential POCT Participants Arm I receive PORT first day therapy . For lung adenocarcinoma , first day radiotherapy administer concurrently POCT ( two cycle chemotherapy give radiotherapy ) ; continue give two cycle sequential chemotherapy . For squamous cell lung carcinoma , PORT administer first follow subsequent four cycle sequential POCT . - Arm II ( PORT-last strategy ) : Four cycle POCT + sequential PORT Participants Arm II receive four cycle adjuvant chemotherapy , sequential adjuvant thoracic conformal radiotherapy ( 50.4 Gy , 1.8 Gy daily 5.5 week ) administer . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 1094 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
