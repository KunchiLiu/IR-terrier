	<brief_summary>Hyaluronic acid ( HA ) filler test in-vitro measure lift capacity , viscosity , cohesivity , rheologic property , lift capacity test animal model . To date , study measure lift capacity filler in-vivo human model . The intention study lift capacity filler group patient compare pre post-procedure two three-dimensional photograph use analytic software . Specifically , PI interest determine amount tissue elevation create injecting HAs Restylane-LyftÂ® , ( Galderma Laboratories , L.P. , Fort Worth , TX ) midface low face , anterior-posterior direction vertical direction use analytic software . The research group identify reliable reproducible quantitative assessment midfacial position call WIZDOM ( Width InterZygomatic Distance Of Midface ) quantitatively evaluate midface . It use objective tool ass midfacial rejuvenation , whether fat , filler , midface facelift surgery . The Distance WIZDOM inner canthus , WIZDOM -IC measurement increase age face deflates descends , , practice , also mean assess midface youth age . The PI 's finding submit Aesthetic Surgery Journal . The practice attempt utilize metric measure midface aesthetic lifting capacity . The practice also employ 3 D photography analytic software determine degree lift mm z axis . ( vertical AP increase dimension ) pre post- injection . ( Vectra , Canfield , Fairfield , NJ ) A secondary goal study measure duration efficacy patient satisfaction various endpoint . A standardized rating system use - Medicis Midface Volume Scale ( MMVS ) -measured three independent physician subjective Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale ( GAIS ) -measured subject three independent physician -to monitor outcomes follow-up .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All filler inject location FDA approve on-label indication ( cheek , subcutaneously supraperiosteally , dermis subdermis correction wrinkle fold nasolabial fold ) place usual customary use technique practice author accept widely . Additional step prior injection study temporary sterile magic marker marking marker face detailed photography take , , injection , segmentation injection midface inject prior separately low face . Follow-up also rigorous routine , approximately q 3 month basis 2 year . Patients allow additional HA filler place perioral area subsequent initiation study augment/define lip treat perioral rhytids follow-up period . These treatment area allow outside study part study . The PI assume addition filler location impact midface jawline , add aesthetic benefit patient . All filler administer office PI .</detailed_description>
