	<brief_summary>After basic training echocardiography , emergency physician answer simple clinical question circulatory failure mechanism . The objective study assess agreement answer expert physician patient admit emergency department circulatory failure due sepsis . Emergency physicians volunteer take part basic training echocardiography . The training include 4 hour theory , 2 hour interactive clinical case 6 hour tutored practice patient ' bedside ( 10 15 examination ) . The objective practice session learn technical ground transthoracic echocardiography ( TTE ) , different view identify anatomical structure . The second part study start training . Each eligible patient successively assess two investigator : one emergency physician recently train expert physician . The echocardiography perform soon possible emergency department initiation treatment without delay . The order hemodynamic assessment random depend availability investigator ; assessment however perform within 30 minute . Each investigator independently read echocardiography real time patient ' bedside . They answer limited list standardize question use two-choice answer predefined choice . Finally investigator choose therapeutic proposition among predefined list base answer . Only result echocardiography performed expert physician use patient management .</brief_summary>
