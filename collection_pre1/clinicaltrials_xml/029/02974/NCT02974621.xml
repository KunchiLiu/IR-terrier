	<brief_title>Cediranib Maleate Olaparib Compared Bevacizumab Treating Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare antitumor activity cediranib maleate ( cediranib ) /olaparib versus reference bevacizumab monotherapy , measure progression-free survival 6 month ( PF6 ) , patient recurrent glioblastoma ( GBM ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare overall survival ( OS ) , objective response ( ORR ) patient recurrent GBM treat cediranib/olaparib versus bevacizumab . II . To assess safety combination olaparib cediranib patient recurrent GBM III . To evaluate association blood base biomarkers involve angiogenesis use Biomarker Review Committee-approved Plasma Angiome Panel ( bFGF , Ang-1 , Ang-2 , Tie-2 , SDF1-α , Collagen IV , PlGF , sVEGFR1 , sVEGFR2 , VEGF , Il-1β , Il-6 , Il-8 , TNF-α , CAIX ) clinical activity cediranib/olaparib . IV . To evaluate association tissue biomarkers involve deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) repair use Biomarker Review Committee-approved BROCA panel clinical activity cediranib/olaparib . V. To identify genomic alteration whole exome sequence GBM tumor specimen correlate clinical activity cediranib/olaparib . VI . To evaluate association magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) image parameter ( vascular permeability , tumor perfusion oxygenation , brain tumor cellularity ) biological response cediranib/olaparib . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 arm . ARM A : Patients receive olaparib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) cediranib maleate PO daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . ARM B : Patients receive bevacizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute every 2 week . In arm , course repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
