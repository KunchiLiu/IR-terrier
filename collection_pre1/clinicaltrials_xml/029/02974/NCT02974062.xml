	<brief_title>Immediate Effect Core Stabilization Exercise Trunk Proprioception Healthy Individuals</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study use sample convenience age 18 - 40 . Sixty healthy participant recruit flyer post 2 Mahidol university physical therapy clinic Pinklao Salaya , well word mouth participant friend . Sample size calculation perform use G*Power software ( G*Power version 3.1.9.2 , University Kiel , Germany ) . To knowledge , study investigate immediate effect core stabilization exercise trunk proprioception neither healthy individual , patient low back pain . However , base clinical experience , expect find improvement ( 1-tailed ) medium effect size ( Cohen 's = 0.5 ) ; therefore , total 60 participant require confidence level ( α ) .05 power ( 1-β ) .80 . Participants interested participation underwent screening process use inclusion-exclusion criterion checklist receive brief information regard study . If meet inclusion criterion , consent process perform . To ensure understood study , simply ask regard study ( i.e . objective , benefit , etc . ) sign consent form . After participant provide write informed consent , participant fill information sheet demographic data . After , change cloth lab tank top short expose low back ( L1 S2 ) . The body landmark , include lumbar spine ( L1 ) sacrum ( S2 ) identify marked skin pen iPhone placement . Each iPhone place iPhone pocket transparent film order see iPhone monitor . The pocket attach participant use Velcro strap around his/her trunk pelvis . These body landmark identification iPhone placement process perform male female investigator base upon participant 's gender . Once participant complete setting , data collection process begin . Participants stand draw paper foot shoulder width apart . The foot print drawn use marker . This foot print use post-test positioning . The participant stand natural stance arm side . Participants instruct stand straight maintain position record lumbar sacral angle neutral position . After record , participant instruct perform 2 set 3 repetition stand forward bend far return upright position . Lumbar sacral angle full trunk flexion , well lumbar sacral angle completion return upright record repetition . Data set use determine test-retest ( intra-trial ) reliability iPhone application , well establish minimal detectable change ( intra-trial ) . Participants underwent trunk proprioception test ( pre-test ) process first perform practice trial . Participants perform trunk flexion 30° , 45° , 60° ( 4 repetition degree ) feedback investigator use iPhones attach lumbar spine sacrum . This practice trial aim participant get familiar test protocol , well minimize learn effect . After completion practice trial , participant underwent pre-test data collection perform 3 repetition trunk flexion randomly select angle repetition ( 30° , 45° , 60° ) without feedback . Investigators record lumbar sacral angle data . After completion pre-test data collection , iPhones remove body landmark erase . Each participant randomize either control exercise group . Participants control group wait 15 minute ( newspaper magazine provide wait period ) , participant exercise group underwent assessment core stability order select appropriate level core stabilization exercise . After , participant group receive 30-minute core stabilization exercise . Clinically , physical therapist would prescribe 30-minute core stabilization exercise program patient non-specific low back pain . This exercise focus motor control rather strength , endurance , cardiovascular system.37 It low intensity exercise develop ability automatically control co-contraction deep abdominal back muscle functional movement . Therefore , possibility experience muscle fatigue minimal . However , participant instruct perform stretch exercise data collection complete , perform follow day well . Once participant control group finish 15-minute rest , participant exercise group complete core stabilization exercise , underwent practice trial post-test data collection use protocol start mark body landmark . Data test ( first 2 set 3 repetition ) retest ( last 2 set 3 repetition ) control group use determine test-retest ( inter-trial ) reliability , well derive minimal detectable change ( inter-trial ) protocol . Approximate time test protocol 45 minute include 15-minute rest period control group , whereas 60 minute include 30-minute core stabilization exercise exercise group . Rating perceived exertion ( RPE ) heart rate use monitor participant throughout protocol avoid fatigue . Pre- post-test data control exercise group use determine immediate effect core stabilization exercise . All Statistical analysis perform use statistical package social science ( SPSS ) software ( IBM SPSS Statistics Windows , Version 21.0 . Armonk , New York , USA ) . Study objective 1 determine test-retest reliability iPhone application measurement protocol . Mean angular displacement data iPhone application use calculate test-retest reliability use intraclass correlation coefficient ( ICC2 , k ) confidence interval . Significance level hold .05 analysis . Study objective 2 establish minimal detectable change ( MDC ) measurement . Minimal detectable change define small amount change likely reflect true change rather measurement error iPhone application protocol . Study objective 3 determine immediate effect 30-minute core stabilization exercise trunk proprioception healthy individual . Prior utilization statistical test , descriptive statistic perform statistical assumption test . Transformation perform data normally distribute . Appropriate statistical test ( parametric vs. non-parametric ) perform determine effect 30-minute core stabilization exercise trunk proprioception . Significance level hold .05 analysis . Post-hoc power analysis also perform .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Between age 18 40 No episode back pain 3 month prior participation No regular exercise routine compose core stabilization exercise We select age range 18 40 year one previous study demonstrate patient nonspecific low back pain age 40 year old likely clinical lumbar instability would benefit core stabilization exercise.15 In addition , patient older 40 year old likely specific low back condition,46 degenerative spine , spondylosis , spinal stenosis , may interfere interpretation effect core stabilization exercise trunk proprioception . Clinical sign systemic disease Definitive neurologic sign include weakness numbness low extremity Previous spinal surgery Diagnosed osteoporosis , severe spinal stenosis , and/or inflammatory joint disease Pregnancy Any low extremity condition would potentially alter trunk movement Vestibular dysfunction Extreme psychosocial involvement Body mass index ( BMI ) great 30 kg/m2 Active treatment another medical illness would preclude participation aspect study</criteria>
