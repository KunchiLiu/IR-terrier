	<brief_summary>Background : Some disease cause chronic inflammation intermittent flare body . These call autoinflammatory disease . They cause fever , rash , ulcer , problem . Researchers want learn cause effect disease . They hope improve disease manage future . Objectives : To understand underlie immune dysregulation To identify genetic cause To translate finding novel treatment improve patient disease outcome Eligibility : Patients know NOMID/CAPS , DIRA , CANDLE , SAVI , NLRC4-MAS , Still 's Disease , yet undifferentiated autoinflammatory disease . Unaffected relatives participant know undifferentiated autoinflammatory disease Healthy adult volunteer least 18 year age Design : Participants screen blood sample medical history . They may provide copy medical record . Enrolled participant evaluate NIH 2-5 day . All participant detail medical history , physical exam , blood test , evaluation depend extent autoinflammatory disease . Participants may also expect follow assessment : 1 . Clinical test help assess organ damage function hearing , vision , memory , learn test . 2 . Imaging study characterize organ involvement inflammatory disease include : X-rays , CT scan , special MRIs , bone scan . 3 . Laboratory evaluation include clinical marker disease activity , research sample &lt; TAB &gt; genetic study , blood sample cytokine/biomarker assessment , gene expression profiling. &lt; TAB &gt; 4 . Questionnaires assess disease activity quality life . 5 . If indicate , procedure may administer include : lumbar puncture CNS inflammation suspect , skin biopsy skin inflammation present , and/or gastrointestinal pulmonary procedure clinically indicate . Participants may return single follow-up visit long-term follow-up visit depend disease willingness return . Long-term follow-up may occur 15 year protocol .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Autoinflammatory disease group immune dysregulatory disease characterize recurrent episode systemic inflammation well organ-specific inflammation involve skin , eye , joint , bone , muscle , lung , serosal surface , inner ear , brain , organ . The prominent role IL-1 pathogenesis disorder first become evident discovery mutation gene NLRP3/CIAS1 . Since , identify additional mutation cause autoinflammatory disease , include mutation proteasome component TMEM173/STING suggest role increase type I IFN signal contributor disease pathogenesis autoinflammatory disease . In natural history study , seek comprehensively evaluate people autoinflammatory disease clinical , genetic , immunologic , endocrinologic perspective . Other rare disease mediate IL-1 type I IFN presume autoinflammatory disease unknown genetic cause also eligible protocol . In addition , intend evaluate long-term outcome biomarkers time . We plan follow participant duration study ( 15 year ) . Relatives autoinflammatory disease well healthy volunteer also recruit serve control biomarker , genetic , molecular analysis .</detailed_description>
