	<brief_title>Efficacy `` Pain Gear '' Patients With Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PainGear [ ActiPatch® ] ( BioElectronics Corporation , MD , USA ) recently introduce 'topical ' analgesic localize musculoskeletal pain . PainGear noninvasive , low power , easy use , pulse shortwave therapy device localize musculoskeletal pain . The device produce heat sensation . There two basic requirement use device , switch via on/off switch , affix device target area body . The area treatment confine area within 11.5-cm diameter loop antenna cover area 100 cm2 , antennae circular , soft flexible shaped fit area/location treat require . The device use 24 h per day place area localize pain either use medical tape specifically design wrap . In randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical trial , patient radiographic evidence knee OA ( osteoarthritis ) persistent pain high 40mm visual analog scale ( VAS ) recruit . The trial consist 12 h daily treatment 1 month 60 knee OA patient . After 1 month , PainGear induce significant reduction VAS pain Western Ontario McMaster Universities Arthritis Index ( WOMAC ) score compare placebo . Additionally , pain tolerance physical health improve PainGear -treated patient . Twenty-six per cent patient PainGear group stop NSAID/analgesic therapy . No adverse event detect .</detailed_description>
