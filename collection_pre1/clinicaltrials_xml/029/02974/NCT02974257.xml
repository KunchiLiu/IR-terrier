	<brief_summary>This study evaluate whether thiamine increase oxygen consumption lower lactate patient initially survive in-hospital cardiac arrest . Patients successfully resuscitate in-hospital cardiac arrest mechanical ventilation intensive care unit enrol , get either thiamine placebo . Their oxygen consumption lactate measure serial time point compare group . The investigator ' hypothesis thiamine help restore body 's ability metabolize oxygen normally ( aerobic metabolism ) , lead increase oxygen consumption decrease lactate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Thiamine v . Placebo Increase Oxygen Consumption After Cardiac Arrest</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In-hospital cardiac arrest often lead shock organ failure , low oxygen consumption high lactate associate bad outcome . Thiamine B vitamin necessary maintain body 's ability use oxygen effectively , investigator find many patient thiamine deficient cardiac arrest . The investigator also find thiamine decrease lactate thiamine-deficient patient critically ill . Patients study randomize receive either thiamine placebo every 12 hour 2 day survive in-hospital cardiac arrest . The investigator measure oxygen consumption continuously time monitor attach ventilator tubing , also measure lactate lab value several time point .</detailed_description>
