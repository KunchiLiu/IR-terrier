	<brief_summary>The goal project guide rTMS use fMRI individual depression respond standard TMS treatment evaluate whether target TMS use individualized functional MRI scan produce outcome superior conventional approach . The study team also plan scan MDD patient prescribe receive standard TMS first time resting-state FMRI scan order see predict responsiveness base functional connectivity map .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Significance : There therapeutic option individual treatment resistant depression ( TRD ) . One recently develop approach rTMS leave dorsolateral prefrontal cortex . Recent study demonstrate overall antidepressant benefit rTMS patient fail respond trial antidepressant medication ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) . Nevertheless , many patient response incomplete , suggest need optimization . One potential cause heterogeneous response might relate individual difference brain anatomy connectivity pattern . At present , rTMS stimulation site across subject base upon fix location relative motor cortex . Potentially , however , approach could optimize stimulate base upon individual brain functional connectivity pattern . The present project collect pre- post-treatment brain functional connectivity measure group patient receive independent clinical rTMS resistant depression , connectivity-based target approach apply single-subject level individualize therapy patient respond standard approach . Patients divide 2 group . Group 1 ( N=30 ) depress patient undergo standard TMS first time . Group 2 ( N=30 ) constitute previously demonstrate respond standard TMS . MDD patient prescribe receive standard TMS first time ( group 1 ) resting-state FMRI order see responsiveness base functional connectivity map predict . Non-responders standard TMS approach ( Group 2 ) randomize ( 3:2 ) either receive target ( N=20 ) standard ( N=10 ) repetitive TMS ( rTMS ) treatment . A connectivity-based targeting strategy use patient undergo targeted rTMS optimize target focal brain stimulation . Raters patient group 2 kept blind treatment assignment . All patient refer ongoing treatment study assess 3 tesla brain MRI , MRS CBF/CBV procedures baseline immediately follow final treatment .</detailed_description>
