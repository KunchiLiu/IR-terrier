	<detailed_description>Significant progress make characterize optimal environment develop embryo culture . These effort base premise clinical embryo culture mimic vivo environment . To end , investigator go great lengths recreate every aspect natural set early embryo expose . This focused approach lead significant modification embryo culture system modern vitro fertilization ( IVF ) lab ultimately improvement pregnancy rate . One area subject significant scrutiny relationship incubator oxygen concentration early embryonic development . Oxygen play central role embryonic metabolism . The mechanism govern utilization dependent stage embryonic development . During first 3 day development , oxygen reach embryo via passive diffusion concentration gradient regulate oxygen consumption oxidative phosphorylation . Inefficiencies process - due compromise integrity inner mitochondrial membrane alteration substrate availability - result excessive production harmful reactive oxygen specie cause significant damage cellular machinery ultimately lead embryonic arrest . The concentration oxygen embryo culture expose also impact delicately balanced system alter metabolic health embryo . Historically , atmospheric oxygen concentration ( approximately 20 % ) exclusively use human IVF laboratory embryo culture . However , multiple investigation subsequently find physiologic concentration oxygen within female reproductive tract well atmospheric level , consistently measure &lt; 10 % . These observation lead multiple trial compare atmospheric oxygen concentration 5 % oxygen embryo culture . These study demonstrate significant perturbation gene expression , protein secretion , suboptimal utilization amino acid carbohydrates embryos culture atmospheric oxygen . The comparison make clinical IVF study demonstrate embryos culture 5 % oxygen consistently result increase clinical pregnancy rate live birth rate . A meta-analysis topic suggest clinic baseline live birth rate 30 % could expect improvement great 13 % culture embryos 5 % O2 . As result compelling data , modern IVF program exclusively culture embryos 5 % oxygen concentration . However , propose oxygen concentration embryo expose day 3 development actually low 5 % . These data originate idea embryo cross utero-tubal junction day 3 development vivo . Multiple study demonstrate oxygen concentration uterus actually low fallopian tube approximately 2 % . Thus , physiologic embryo culture system would culture embryos 5 % oxygen day 3 decrease oxygen concentration 2 % transfer cryopreservation day 5 6 . A change optimal oxygen concentration embryo day 3 would fit general shift metabolic requirement embryos see stage development . Activation embryonic genome occur day 3 prompt significant increase biosynthetic activity . The metabolic behavior embryo also shift substantially time . The embryo change metabolic strategy oxidative phosphorylation glucose base metabolism form aerobic glycolysis citric acid cycle . During process , term compaction , embryos exhibit greatly increase oxygen consumption . The physiologic environment female reproductive tract tend mirror metabolic need develop preimplantation embryo . As embryo shift metabolic strategy compaction upon enter uterus , certainly possible reduce oxygen concentration uterus may best support energy produce mechanisms stage embryonic development . Recapitulating environment culture may enhance embryonic development long term health pregnancy result IVF . In fact recent pilot study , use embryos donate research demonstrate improved embryo development embryo culture 2 % oxygen day 3 development compare 5 % ( Kaser et al . ) Purpose Proposed Study This study seek compare laboratory outcome embryos culture 2 % oxygen concentration 5 % oxygen concentration compaction . The primary outcome study proportion day 3 embryo ongoing blastocyst stage ( know throughout rest document blastulation rate ) . A . Location Study : Patients recruit participate clinical center . Oocyte retrieval , embryology , embryo biopsy , embryo transfer occur clinical facility Reproductive Medicine Associates New Jersey . All genetic diagnostics occur Foundation Embryonic Competence ( FEC ) . B . Study Population : Infertile couple attempt conception vitro fertilization . 60 couple enrol study ( see sample size calculation ) . STUDY PROCEDURES Experimental Design The purpose study evaluate embryological impact 2 % oxygen versus 5 % concentration embryo culture day 3 development . As , study related procedure begin patient 's embryos reach day 3 development . The experimental design study follow : ( Figure 1 ) 1 . All care include oocyte retrieval , fertilization ICSI , cleavage stage culture ( day 0 , 1 , 2 ) completely per routine . 2 . It standard protocol laboratory remove embryos incubator day 3 1 ) perform assist hatch 2 ) change embryos cleavage stage medium blastocyst medium 3 . At time assist hatching , two 5-well extended culture dish bring isolette changeover extended culture take place . The configuration 5-well dish follow . One mL blastocyst medium place center well 5-well dish . This well use wash cleavage stage embryos prior placement blastocyst medium drop . The outer four well contain small drop ongoing blastocyst culture . As part study , assist hatch complete , embryos place center well mixed 1 mL blastocyst medium . At low power magnification ability perform day 3 grading , half embryo place out drops one 5-well dish half place out drop 5-well dish . These two dish separate left right side isolette . An embryologist , open sequentially number , opaque seal envelope box mark `` oxygen randomization . '' The piece paper envelope direct embryologist place 5-well dish leave side isolette either 2 5 % oxygen concentration incubator . The 5-well dish right side incubator go opposite condition . 4 . The number ongoing day 3 embryo condition record give data assessor . 5 . Embryos examine manipulate day 5 development per routine protocol . 6 . On day 5 6 embryo development , embryos evaluate number ongoing blastocyst record embryos culture condition . 7 . All ongoing embryo undergo trophectoderm biopsy use standardize technique accord standard laboratory protocol without regard study . Embryos cryopreserved allow result comprehensive chromosomal screen available optimize embryonic-endometrial synchrony , per standard protocol . 8 . Further decision regard number euploid embryos transfer patient . Data collect regard pregnancy outcome accord culture condition transfer embryo expose . However , information analyze secondary outcome . 9 . Pregnancy test follow alter . RANDOMIZATION SCHEMA Simple randomization perform independently study site ( RMANJ ) . A random number sequence generate random.org . Odd number assign A intervention ( 2 % ) oxygen even number assign B intervention ( 5 % ) . Pieces paper contain letter dictate random number sequence place box sequentially number , opaque seal envelope label `` oxygen randomization . '' As noted , day 3 , place half embryos one 5-well dish half embryos another 5-well dish , embryologist separate dish leave right hand side incubator . The embryologist , open sequentially number , opaque seal envelope box mark `` oxygen randomization . '' The piece paper envelope direct embryologist place 5-well dish leave side isolette either 2 5 % oxygen concentration incubator . The 5-well dish right side incubator go opposite condition . In case odd number embryo , extra embryo always place leave hand 5-well dish . The number anticipate even left sided dish equal chance randomization 2 5 % oxygen concentration .</detailed_description>
