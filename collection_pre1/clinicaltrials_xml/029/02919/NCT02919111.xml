	<brief_title>Gallium-68 PSMA-11 PET Intermediate High-risk Preprostatectomy Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Imaging stag prostate cancer critical surgical treatment planning . Patients suspect metastatic prostate cancer image use Gallium-68 label PSMA-11 order demonstrate utility . The investigator plan utilize data obtain approval Ga-68-PSMA-11 compound , agent become available clinical imaging prostate cancer patient . In pre-prostatectomy population , primary objective determine sensitivity specificity detection nodal metastasis . This compound show superior choline base PET agent stag prostate cancer , Carbon-11 Fluorine-18 compound . But compound patent therefore company private entity make investment require bring Ga-68-PSMA-11 market . In vacuum availability , academic group must take lead order collect necessary data future FDA approval .</detailed_description>
