	<brief_summary>This study compare efficacy two dental intervention treatment cervical dentine sensitivity . The participant select adult dental patient register general dental practice West Sussex , UK . The participant split 2 group . One group receive intervention topical fluoride varnish application group receive topical application self-etching dentine bonding agent .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Trial Compare Efficacy Fluoride Gel Dental Bonding Agent Treatment Tooth Sensitivity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Topical Fluoride Varnish ( TFV ) Self-Etching Dentine Bonding Agent ( SEDBA ) routinely use dentistry management cervical dentine sensitivity ( CDS ) . Both intervention topically apply well tolerated patient . The intervention differ mechanism action . TFV release fluoride incorporate organic matrix dentine make dentine tubule less conductive . Dentinal tubule form key conduit stimulus pain perception tooth . SEDBA differs penetrate occludes tubule . It light cure almost instant set time .</detailed_description>
