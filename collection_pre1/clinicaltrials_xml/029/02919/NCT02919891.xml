	<brief_summary>This retrospective , observational study utilise Edinburgh Cancer Research Centre 's Tissue Bank provide sample IENFD test undergone mastectomy surgery breast cancer . The investigator shall identify patient Tissue Bank database undergone mastectomy surgery breast cancer . The investigator shall consult patient 's electronic health record , general practitioner require , ascertain whether patient die , diagnose cognitive impairment psychotic disorder , receive ongoing oncological treatment would exclude study . The investigator shall also exclude patient receive surgery within last year intend elucidate presence pain immediate post-operartive period 12 month post-operatively . Having identify patient investigator shall contact via post pack contain information document , consent form questionnaire . As observational study shall contact identified patient meet inclusion criterion aim recruit many possible . The investigator would anticipate high response rate experience previous questionnaire study breast cancer patient . Once signed consent form return patient 's tissue sample would undergo IENFD test . Their questionnaire response allow participant split two group base upon whether experience CPSP . Blinding group take place undertake IENFD test unaware patient 's questionnaire response . Statistical analysis two group 's IEFD result questionnaire responses undertaken null hypothesis pre-operative IENFD site surgery predict correlate CPSP .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Design This study use pre-existing skin sample store Edinburgh Experimental Cancer Medicine Centre ( ECMC ) / SAHSC BioResource ( collect 2006-2012 ) patient undergone breast cancer surgery . The investigator shall firstly identify sample Tissue Bank database take undergoing breast cancer surgery . Before patient detail provide investigator confirm patient initial following section consent form complete time surgery ; `` I agree name detail make available ECMC researcher might approach invite participation research project . These might include study new treatment technique , clinical genetic study cause cancer cancer outcomes . I understand permission commit participate study I able decide whether I wish involve I review information sheet consent form . '' Once confirm , investigator shall consult patient 's electronic health record ascertain whether anything would exclude study death , new diagnosis cognitive impairment psychotic disorder , receive current oncological treatment . As exploratory study investigator shall contact identified patient meet inclusion criterion aim recruit many possible . The investigator would anticipate high response rate , experience previous questionnaire study involve breast cancer patient . The investigator contact identified patient via post pack contain cover letter principal investigator original clinical team , information document , consent form questionnaire . The information document include contact detail principal investigator research team allow patient discuss study , ask question , ask assistance research team aspect complete documentation . The questionnaire requirement participant complete study take less 30 minute . The questionnaire include Hospital Anxiety Depression Score ( HADS ) , EQ-5D , Brief Pain Inventory ( BPI ) , Short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire-2 Short Leeds Assessment Neuropathic Symptoms Signs ( S-LANSS ) commonly use scoring tool chronic pain . There need hospital visit , physical examination , blood test . After 4-6 week , response receive individual patient would send second letter ensure initial pack receive . Once signed consent form questionnaire return , paper Case Report Form ( CRF ) create unique study number add questionnaire identify information . The unique number currently give Edinburgh Experimental Cancer Medicine Centre ( ECMC ) / SAHSC BioResource sample hold patient also add CRF . In way , carry laboratory work questionnaire data entry provide identifying number blind since access CRF . The Edinburgh Experimental Cancer Medicine Centre ( ECMC ) / SAHSC BioResource sample shall serially cut microtome produce 8 micron thick section three section per sample create ensure consistency . The section shall stain neurofilament anti-protein gene product ( anti-PGP ) 9.5 examined bright field microscopy . An image section shall capture analysed individual use Image J software calculate IENFD . Once sample analyse CRF would use place IENFD result two group base upon questionnaire response . These two group would without CPSP symptom . Statistical analysis two group 's IEFD result questionnaire responses undertaken null hypothesis pre-operative IENFD site surgery predict correlate CPSP . Study Centres Recruitment patient take place Edinburgh Cancer Research Centre ( ECRC ) Western General Hospital . Timelines Consent The investigator would expect read cover letter information pack , sign consent form , complete questionnaire take 20 30 minute . The investigator aim recruit patient 3 - 6 month period move perform IENFD test next 6 - 9 month . A 3 - 6 month require analyse present result . The patient already consent tissue sample use future research . Consent seek patient complete questionnaire essential study order identify develop CPSP . There ongoing intervention follow-up patient consent inclusion study . However , complete questionnaire become aware suffer CPSP provide detail refer pain specialist feel would benefit . To facilitate would contact general practitioner detail refer patient via SCI Gateway Advice Service Lothian Chronic Pain Service Email Advice Service .</detailed_description>
