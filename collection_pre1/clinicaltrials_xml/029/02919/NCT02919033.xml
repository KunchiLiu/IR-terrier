	<brief_title>Compare Effects Telemedicine Approach With Usual Care Hypertension Management China</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Hypertension major risk factor cardiovascular disease control rate remain low worldwide . Studies find telemonitoring blood pressure ( BP ) help control hypertension randomize control trial . However , little known effect structure primary care model primary care physician ( PCP ) partner cardiology specialist electronic healthcare data share medical intervention . This study aim identify effect coordinate PCP-Cardiologist model applies telemedicine tool facilitate community hypertension control China . Methods/Design : Hypertensive patient receive care four community healthcare center ( CHCs ) academically affiliate Shanghai Chest Hospital , Shanghai JiaoTong University eligible uncontrolled blood pressure previous three month access mobile internet . Study subject randomly assign three interventional group : 1 ) usual care ; 2 ) home-based BP tele-monitor embed GSM module unlimited data plan , App access personal healthcare record receive personalize lifestyle coaching content , proficiency training use ; 3 ) plus coordinated PCP-Cardiologist care PCPs cardiologists share data via secure CareLinker website determine interventional approach . The primary outcome mean change systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) 12-month period . Secondary outcome change diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) , HbA1C , blood lipid , medication adherence measure eight-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale MMAS . Discussion : This study determine whether coordinate PCP-Cardiologist Telemedicine Model ( PCTM ) incorporate lasted telemedicine technology improve hypertension care . Success model would help streamline present community healthcare process impact great number uncontrolled hypertensive patient .</detailed_description>
