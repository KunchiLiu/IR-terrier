	<detailed_description>Single ventricle ( SV ) lesion lead cause morbidity mortality congenital heart disease ( CHD ) United States . The definitive palliative surgery modify Fontan operation systemic venous return rout directly pulmonary artery . The surgical reconstruction perform stage year include `` Stage I '' hemiFontan bidirectional Glenn operation . These child know great neurodevelopmental ( ND ) deficits general population form CHD . For example , study Children 's Hospital Philadelphia reveal 9 year old , 1/3 receive form special education ; median intelligence quotient ( IQ ) 86 mental retardation 18 % . One component ultimate ND outcome cerebral blood flow ( CBF ) . Preliminary data SV literature across age range multiple disease state , suggest CBF related ND ; recent review 25 study bear . Another component ND outcome anatomic brain lesion . Preliminary data current NIH study CBF study suggest link CBF brain lesion ( decrease CBF associate brain lesion ) , weave complex interaction lead ultimate ND outcome . There press need understand CBF brain lesion relate childhood ND ; rapid growth stage may especially important ultimate cognitive function humanistic/social impact large economic one well . Data previous NIH grant end November 2014 indicate CBF SV patient change throughout staged surgery first 2 stage , stress condition hypercarbia ; addition , initial look data suggest difference brain abnormality well . These child especially risk altered CBF brain abnormality change physiology . At Stage I , `` runoff '' physiology present create aorto-pulmonary shunt potentially cause `` steal '' cerebral circulation . In 2nd stage ( e.g . hemiFontan ) , cerebral pulmonary circulation connect directly exclusively series ; aortic blood flow brain directly lungs via superior vena cava . After Fontan completion , downstream cerebral venous pressure elevate . Finally , SV patient develop aorto-pulmonary collateral ( APC ) stag another ongoing research project find strong inverse correlation CBF degree APC flow , put CBF SV risk . In another study , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) utilized measure blood flow visualize cerebral anatomy phase contrast MRI arterial spin label anatomic image T1 weight sequence diffusion tensor imaging . MRI utilizing susceptometry ( oximetry ) recently develop investigator renewal , also quantify cerebral metabolic rate oxygen consumption ( CMRO2 ) . This combination MRI capabilities offer unique opportunity assess cerebral anatomy , hemodynamics oxygen metabolism study ; combine ND testing , study poise link two hope understand cognitive function positively intervene ND outcome . A comprehensive assessment brain anatomy function link ND outcome never report group patient utilize measure 2 time point . This prospective , single center study SV patient seek relate cerebral anatomy , hemodynamics CMRO2 ND outcome use another patient cohort obtain previous study basis utilize data 2 time point ( original grant renewal ) . This approach along use cerebral carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) reactivity CMRO2 major strength study . Elucidating factor may ultimately lead modification management ( e.g . timing surgery ) identify child cognitive risk implement early intervention possibly improve ND outcome .</detailed_description>
