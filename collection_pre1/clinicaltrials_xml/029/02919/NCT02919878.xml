	<brief_title>Neo-adjuvant Chemoradiotherapy Using Infusional Gemcitabine Followed Surgery Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Results neo-adjuvant chemo-radiation advanced rectal cancer plateaued pathological complete response rate 10-20 % spite addition new cytotoxic agent and/ molecular targeted therapy . The combination 5-fluorouracil radiation produce effective sensitization improvement require assessment sensitizer increase pathological complete response rate . Gemcitabine use combination radiation several GI cancer study examine role rectal cancer . This study examine combination Gemcitabine radiation neo-adjuvant therapy advance rectal cancer increase pathological complete response ( pCR ) rate investigator traditional 6 % &gt; 40 % .</detailed_description>
