	<brief_title>Brown Fat Activation Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study determine whether amount activity brown adipose tissue ( BAT ) beige adipose increase use Mirabegron Pioglitazone , alone combination . The research procedure conduct University Kentucky ( UK ) Medical Center Center Clinical Translational Sciences research unit ( CCTS ) . Study participant need come CCTS Unit approximately 9 visit , outline . Most visit le 1 hour , 3 visit involve procedure vary time range 4 hour 8 hour . Thus , participant 's total participation approximately 9 visit next 12 week . After pass screen phase , participant randomize ( like flip coin ) Visit 4 one three treatment group participant stay assign treatment group entire participation study . The three group : - Group M : Mirabegron 50 mg/day - Group P : Pioglitazone 30 mg/day - Group MP : combination Mirabegron 50 mg/day Pioglitazone 30 mg/day Fasting requirement : Nothing eat 9 pm night specific test procedure . Glucose tolerance test fasting lab test : This standard oral glucose tolerance test use 75 g glucose , blood glucose insulin drawn time 0 , 30 , 60 , 90 , 120 min . This test determine participant impair glucose tolerance , diabetes , normal . This fast blood sample use conduct routine blood test normal part physical exam , cholesterol , liver enzymes electrolyte . Based blood test , oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) , measurement , investigator determine whether participant impair glucose tolerance normal glucose level , whether fit criterion study . Body Mass Index DXA Scan : The investigator record participant 's weight , height , waist hip measurement . Measurement total body fat perform determine participant 's percent body fat use dual energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) . DXA use low level X-ray measure amount fat , muscle , bone different body area . Participants ask lie table wear light clothe gown . Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) Scan : A PET scan type image test . It use radioactive substance call tracer look high area metabolic activity body . A PET scan standard test perform certain condition , instance use see participant 's brown fat . 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) FDA-approved drug inject body PET scan , use `` tracer '' help light area doctor need see . The investigator study effectiveness drug study . To see brown fat , investigator first need make participant cold . To , participant change loose fitting light clothing , place around midsection , special jacket , cold water circulate jacket 1 hr . The jacket remove , participant inject vein ( IV ) FDG tracer . The IV needle often insert inside elbow . The tracer travel blood collect organs tissue . This help radiologist see certain area clearly . Participants lie narrow table slide large tunnel-shaped scanner . The PET detects signal tracer . A computer change signal 3D picture . The image display monitor radiologist read . Fat biopsy : After overnight fast , biopsy procedure perform follow : A fat sample ( call fat biopsy ) remove investigator lower abdomen thigh . The skin biopsy sit anesthetize use local anesthetic , lidocaine , 1 incision make abdomen ½ inch incision thigh , skin , small amount fat tissue remove . The incision close use stitch . Participants total 4 fat biopsy : Two prior receive study drug ( time visit 2-4 ) two take study drug ( time visit 6-9 ) . Muscle biopsy . At time thigh adipose biopsy , muscle biopsy perform skin incision . Participants total 2 muscle biopsy : 1 prior receive study drug ( time visit 2-4 ) one take study drug ( time visit 6-9 ) . Euglycemic clamp : Insulin sensitivity measure use clamp . Participants come CCTS fast overnight . Two intravenous plastic tube insert vein arm . Participants give constant injection glucose along constant injection insulin . The glucose insulin balance participant 's blood glucose stay constant 90-100 mg/dl . Blood drawn intravenous line frequently ( every 5-10 minute ) measurement blood glucose insulin . These blood measurement continue 4 hour ; total amount blood withdrawn 100 cc ( 6 tablespoon ) , one quarter much would take participant donate blood . Urine Collection : Females capable get pregnant , also ask give sample urine test pregnancy . If test result positive pregnancy , participant able participate study .</detailed_description>
