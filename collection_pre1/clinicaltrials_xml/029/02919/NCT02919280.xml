	<brief_summary>The Dallas 2K 5-year natural history , longitudinal , prospective study cohort 2,000 participant help uncover socio-demographic , lifestyle , clinical , psychological neurobiological factor contribute anti-depressant treatment response : remission , recurrence , relapse individual outcomes depressive disorder . Hence , expect duration study 10 year length . Since observational study , investigator explore comprehensive panel carefully select participant specific parameter : socio-demographic ( age , ethnicity , economic ) ; lifestyle ( physical activity , substance use ) ; clinical ( medical history , anxious depression , early life trauma ) , biological ( biomarkers blood , saliva , urine ) , behavioral ( cognitive , emotional ) , neurophysiological ( EEG ) , neuroimaging ( structural , functional brain circuitry ) goal develop robust predictive model treatment response depression outcomes . There medication non-medication treatment intervention provide study . Subjects elevate symptomatology nonpsychotic chronic recurrent depressive disorder currently receive prescribe standard care medication non-medication base treatment providers/clinicians . The study cohort reflect wide range patient see typical primary psychiatric care setting , may include unipolar bipolar disorder dysthymia ( chronic form depression ) . The cohort broadly representative generalizable US general population whole . Participants recruit UT Southwestern Depression Cohort , registry volunteer consent learn participation depression-related research study - ( IRB STU : 092015-049 ) . Participants external Depression Cohort first consent enrolled Depression Cohort consent enrol Dallas 2K study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dallas 2K : A Natural History Study Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This non-randomized , natural history , non-treatment , longitudinal cohort study . Participants receive standard care treatment depression comorbidities treat clinician allow continue treatment study . There experimental study procedure , method use data capture ( questionnaire , blood collection , EEG MRI ) . Participants expect visit study site ( ) repeat collection data ( assessment , biospecimens , image procedure ) , 4 time year 5 year . A reduced battery test allowable subject able willing complete full battery baseline visit . 2000 research participant enrol follow eight-year period ( participant follow 5-years ) collection clinical depression measurement assessment , measurement vital sign , collection biospecimens biochemical genetic analysis , electroencephalogram ( EEG ) behavioral assessment , neuroimaging use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . Skin punch biopsy perform sub-set research cohort , define demonstrate heritable phenotype depression . Stool sample perform sub-set research cohort , define demonstrate heritable phenotype depression . Participants complete PHQ-9 ( Patient Health Questionnaire-9 ) , brief self-administered measure depression severity , PS ( Psychosis Screening ) questionnaire , part inclusion exclusion criterion , respectively . Participants complete require computer-assisted self-rating clinician-administered instrument . The self-rating instrument expect take approximately 2.5 hour use iPad laptop computer , collect detailed socio-demographic , life habit , family medical history , depression severity treatment history . After complete questionnaire , research personnel measure subject 's blood pressure , height , waist hip circumference weight . The subject provide blood , saliva urine sample ( morning blood draw appointment offer whenever participant agree fast blood draw non-fasting blood also collect , possible obtain fasting blood ) . For study assessment , specimen collection ; EEG behavioral phenotyping , Dallas 2K study participant require 5-hour study visit UT Southwestern . Participants give option split visit two convenient , visit 2 use perform EEG behavioral assessment . Participants choose initial visit MDN clinician 's office complete screening , assessment biospecimen collection MDN office require 3-hour visit UT Southwestern clinic EEG behavioral assessment . MRI perform separate 2-hour visit UT Southwestern MRI facility . Schedule study visit , procedure duration Study Procedure Duration A Assessments Questionnaires 3 hour B EEG Behavioral Phenotyping 3 hour C Neuroimaging 2 hour D Sub-Study : Skin punch biopsy 30 minute E Sub-Study : Stool Sample 15 minute Studies A B combine single 5-hour visit occur UT Southwestern . EEG behavioral phenotyping Neuroimaging perform 6-month interval . For participant sub-study , skin punch biopsy , Study D perform one visit , depend participant ' convenience . For participant sub-study stool sample , study E perform 4 visit per year 2 year . Study A repeated 3-month interval 4 time year , follow-up study visit . Phlebotomy Procedures Blood sample collect participant trained phlebotomist , draw sample use standard venipuncture procedure , single venipuncture use small gauge needle . Universal precaution observe phlebotomist draw . The sample collection tube , priority volume collect indicated protocol . Each tube label package processing storage . Electrophysiology ( EEG ) Procedures : Participants undergo electrophysiology measure baseline 6-month interval . Procedures measure outline . Detailed EEG procedure describe EEG Behavioral Tasks Procedures Manual , respectively . The EEG marker study divide three group . Participants first undergo rest EEG . Resting EEG measure four , 2 minute period , half time participant ' eye open , half participant ' eye close . The second EEG measure specifically localize theta activity use technique call Low Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography ( LORETA ) . Finally , participant head-phones place , presented 1000 Hz tone 5 different intensity level . The loudness dependency auditory evoke potential ( LDAEP ) measure time . The total time estimate completion EEG collection visit approximately 2 hour . The EEG workgroup ensure adequate training , standardization measure , validation equipment maintain data consistency quality control purpose . Behavioral Phenotyping : The investigator administer five distinct task participant , assess four domain : 1 ) psychomotor slow , 2 ) cognitive control , 3 ) work memory , 4 ) reward responsiveness . To assess domain , investigator plan administer follow task : psychomotor slowing , Choice RT task ( ~5 min ) word fluency task ( ~5 min ) ; cognitive control , Flanker task ( ~10 min ) ; work memory , A B task ( ~10 min ) ; reward responsiveness , Probabilistic Reward task ( ~10 min ) . This task measure subject 's ability modify behavior response reward . On trial , subject see cartoon face short long mouth . The task indicate whether short long mouth present press one two button . Critically , size difference short long mouth small , correct responses one type ( e.g. , short mouth ) follow monetary reward three time frequently correct response type ( e.g. , long mouth ) . The primary dependent measure response bias : degree subject preferentially choose response frequently reward ( example , short mouth vs. long mouth ) . Other dependent measure include RT measure subject 's ability discriminate mouth size ( 28 ) . All task present use Eprime software , standardize procedure across site . The Behavioral Phenotyping workgroup ensure quality control maintain adequate training standardization measure obtain prior study related activity commence . The total time investigator estimate completion behavioral task study visit 1 hour . Neuroimaging : Eligible participant undergo neuroimaging baseline 6-month interval . Neuroimaging include functional MRI structural acquisition . A brief description procedure outline ; detailed description Neuroimaging Procedures Manual . In total , investigator estimate approximately 90 minute spend scanner per visit . In addition , research personnel spend 30 minute prepare participant . Neuroimaging performed baseline ( study entry ) 6-month interval , total 10 total neuroimaging session study duration . The collection socio-demographics , lifestyle , clinical health-related information obtain self-report questionnaire clinician interview complement physical , biological , EEG neuroimaging measurement collect study visit . The information obtain form database allow wide range research question , anticipate unforeseen , addressed future . Some questionnaire give participant parent require minor . Additional assessment complete minor do study staff assist question difficulty assessment .</detailed_description>
