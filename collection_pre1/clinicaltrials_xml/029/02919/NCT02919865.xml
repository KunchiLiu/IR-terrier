	<brief_summary>Radiation therapy important adjunct treatment patient glioma , although common side effect radiation-induced injury brain parenchyma . Unfortunately , conventional MRI accurate differentiate radiation-induced brain injury recurrent tumour , may demonstrate progressive contrast enhancement . Recent study suggest perfusion MRI could improve differentiation . Perfusion MRI perform injection exogenous contrast use dynamic contrast enhancement ( DCE ) dynamic susceptibility contrast enhancement ( DSC ) . Perfusion MRI also perform without contrast injection use arterial spin labeling ( ASL ) intravoxel incoherent motion ( IVIM ) . DCE-MRI relies accurate measurement T1 value order convert MRI signal intensity contrast concentration . Dynamic susceptibility-weighted contrast enhancement ( DSC ) perfusion common technique use clinical practice measurement tumor relative cerebral blood volume ( rCBV ) bias extravascular contrast leakage susceptibility-weighted artifact . The purpose study evaluate accuracy perfusion MR image use non-contrast contrast-based technique differentiate recurrent tumour radiation-induced brain injury patient know high grade glioma . The investigator compare accuracy IVIM , ASL , DCE DSC technique . A secondary goal study compare two new different T1 mapping method use DCE-MRI .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MR Perfusion Methods Patients With Suspected Recurrent High Grade Gliomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim study evaluate diagnostic accuracy different MR perfusion method differentiate recurrent tumour radiation-induced brain injury patient high grade glioma . The investigator evaluate perfusion method use exogenous agent ( ASL , IVIM ) method use gadolinium contrast agent ( DSC-MRI , DCE-MRI ) . A secondary goal study compare two new different T1 mapping method use DCE-MRI . The first T1 mapping method use Lock-Locker inversion-recovery acquisition ( MOLLI ) measure apparent T1 ( T1* ) . The second T1 mapping method use single-point , saturation-recovery acquisition measure true T1 SMART1Map . This study prospective study involve 50 patient . Patients receive chemoradiation high grade glioma subsequently develop progressive enhance lesion follow-up MR ask participate study . Informed consent patient legal guardian authorize representative patient obtain enrollment . Following enrollment , MR perfusion imaging ( ASL , IVIM , DSC DCE perfusion sequence ) perform addition routine neuronavigational sequence obtain fror re-operative/ therapy planning . Following MR examination , patient may undergo surgical biopsy excision determine clinically neurosurgeon . The location biopsy save intraoperatively allow colocalization histopathology image data . Histopathological analysis perform neuropathologist , yield visual quantitative estimate percent viable tumour radiation necrosis within obtain specimen . All patient , include go surgery , undergo clinical followup image follow-up perfusion imaging . This allow assessment lesion progression time , yield valuable diagnostic information differentiate radiation necrosis tumour recurrence , particularly patient undergo surgery . Following routine clinical MR examination , patient new lesion enlarge lesion see radiation oncologist neurosurgeon . They recruit research nurse ask willing participate research study . If patient agrees participate , investigator add perfusion sequence addition clinical MR exam treatment planning ( stereotactic radiation reresection ) . The MR exam perform clinical research purpose last less 45 minute . Following surgery , investigator correlate pathological finding perfusion diffusion parameter . If patient undergo surgery , use clinical examination serial MRIs ( include perfusion imaging ) determine index lesion likely represent radiation necrosis tumor progression . The investigator follow patient clinically 2 year time progression determine overall survival . Patients high grade glioma follow routinely serial MRIs . The patient progressive enlarge lesion see treat oncologist neurosurgeon . They electronically put request another MR exam need clinically surgical plan and/or follow-up advanced MR image per standard care . When patient come radiology exam , ask participate study radiologist and/or research nurse ( breaches patient confidentiality , put radiologist person get consent since involve patient care ) . If patient agrees participate , study perform accord study MR protocol . If , standard MRI per routine clinical practice perform . The investigator intend recruit patient unable give consent since patient good Karnofsky score inclusion criterion study .</detailed_description>
