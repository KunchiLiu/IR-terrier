Random allocation independent conceal . The project manager responsible ensure eligible participant complete baseline assessment . After baseline assessment , collaborate psychologist eligible participant electronically randomize wait-list intervention group . Psychologists teacher-student-guardian triad wait-list group access Teacher Help session cluster RCT , opportunity complete Teacher Help program September follow academic year choose .
