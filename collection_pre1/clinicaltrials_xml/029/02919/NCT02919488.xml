	<brief_title>The Effect Acute Bout Exercise High-sugar Meal Induced Endothelial Dysfunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Endothelial dysfunction due imbalance vasodilating vasoconstricting substance produce endothelium . An imbalance substances limit ability blood vessel relax response shear stress stimulus . Endothelial dysfunction major risk factor cardiovascular disease . High-sugar intake result postprandial hyperglycemia endothelial dysfunction . Exercise may attenuate endothelial dysfunction induce high-sugar meal . There two study examine effect exercise endothelial dysfunction induce high-sugar intake . Both study find bout aerobic exercise attenuate impaired flow mediate dilation induce high-sugar ingestion . Neither study measure important marker endothelial dysfunction blood nitric oxide , endothelin I , angiotensin II concentration , however . In addition , whether result apply old post-menopausal woman unknown . Understanding acute exercise affect meal-induced endothelial dysfunction old woman important give age relate endothelial dysfunction cardiovascular disease .</detailed_description>
