	<brief_title>Study Asses Effect Dapagliflozin Central Blood Pressure Reduction .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prognostic value central systolic/diastolic pressure , central pulse pressure AI well demonstrate , firstly CAFÉ study , 2073 hypertensive subject follow 3.4 year . It also evidence high prognostic value central blood pressure compare peripheral blood pressure . One year later , STRONG study , show central pulse pressure independent cardiovascular risk factor well higher prognostic value compare peripheral pulse pressure ( Hazard ratio ; 1,1510 mmHg Vs 1,10mmHg ; X2 : 13,4 ; p &lt; 0,001 ) . Those subject higher central blood pressure central pulse pressure show high incidence cardiovascular event . This superiority central pressure versus peripheral measure predict cardiovascular event also report general population elder people . Finally , also report dapagliflozin modestly reduce systolic blood pressure patient T2DM mostly receive treatment hypertension . Despite office blood pressure remain gold standard method screening , diagnostic treatment hypertension , also well demonstrated ambulatory blood pressure monitoring ( ABPM ) good estimate cardiovascular risk target organ damage office blood pressure . It still remain unclear effect 24 hour blood pressure reduction SGLT-2 inhibitor . The effect SGLT2 inhibitor central blood pressure reduction document .</detailed_description>
