	<brief_summary>The aim study evaluate whether use echoclip device ( ultrasound transducer position device stabilize involve part myocardium beat heart ) facilitate image coronary bypass anastomosis coronary bypass surgery . A total 100 low risk patient undergo elective on-pump coronary bypass surgery include study order evaluate surgeon visualize coronary anastomosis closure sternum . Ultrasonograpic picture analyze directly peroperatively electronically post-operatively order evaluate select area anastomosis visualize . Use echoclip devise consider success least 80 % anastomosis visualize .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The technical quality coronary artery bypass anastomose coronary artery bypass graft often evaluate measure flow rate graft use transit time flowmetry . Unfortunately , flow rate flow waveform poor indicator anatomy anastomosis . A good way evaluate anatomy anastomosis 3-dimensional imaging . Three problem must overcome perform epicardial echocardiography beat heart : 1 . The transducer must keep steady position relative anastomosis 5 10 cardiac cycle minimize frame-rate variability . 2 . Ultrasound gel must keep contact transducer region study . 3 . The transducer must cause deformation vessel . The investigator design ultrasound transducer position device , Echoclip device ( Aalborg Hospital , Aalborg , Denmark ) , stabilize involved part myocardium beat heart , keep gel place , position ultrasound transducer correctly image . The present study feasibility study aim evaluate echoclip device facilitate image coronary bypass anastomosis coronary artery bypass surgery human degree show animal study . Ultrasonography use visualize coronary anastomosis 100 elective low-risk ( logistic II EuroSCORE &lt; 6 ) on-pump coronary artery bypass procedure . It register heel , central portion toe anastomosis visualize end-to-side side-to-side anastomoses.Use echoclip devise consider success least 80 % part anastomose visualized either directly electronic reading use special developed algorithm may identify inner border anastomosis .</detailed_description>
