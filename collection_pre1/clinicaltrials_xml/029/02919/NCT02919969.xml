	<brief_summary>This research study study target therapy possible treatment advance anal cancer . The following intervention involve study : -Pembrolizumab</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab Refractory Metastatic Anal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study Phase II clinical trial . Phase II clinical trial test safety effectiveness investigational drug learn whether drug work treat specific disease . `` Investigational '' mean drug study . The FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve pembrolizumab Advanced Anal Cancer , approve us . Pembrolizumab , also know KEYTRUDA MK-3475 , approve USA several country treat type skin cancer call Malignant Melanoma . In research study investigator study investigational drug call Pembrolizumab , monoclonal antibody . Monoclonal antibody manmade mimic protein immune system attach specific protein body . T cell cell immune system control PD-1 . PD-1 protein T cell prevent body overproduce T cell . Pembrolizumab target PD-1 , attach block action . By prevent PD-1 working , T cell production rise body 's immune system may increase action Cancer cell . Clinical laboratory study use pembrolizumab suggest pembrolizumab may useful shrink certain tumor .</detailed_description>

Be ≥18 year age day sign informed consent . Have measurable disease base RECIST 1.1 . Be willing provide tissue newly obtain core excisional biopsy tumor lesion . Newlyobtained defined specimen obtain 6 week ( 42 day ) prior initiation treatment Day 1 . Subjects newlyobtained sample provide ( e.g . inaccessible subject safety concern ) may submit archived specimen upon agreement Sponsor . Have performance status 0 1 ECOG Performance Scale . Demonstrate adequate organ function , screen lab must perform within 10 day treatment initiation . Adequate Organ Function Laboratory Values System Laboratory Value Hematological Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥1,500 /mcL Platelets ≥80,000 / mcL Hemoglobin ≥8.5 g/dL ≥5.6 mmol/L Renal Serum creatinine OR Measured calculate creatinine clearance ( GFR also use place creatinine CrCl ) ≤1.5 X upper limit normal ( ULN ) OR ≥60 mL/min subject creatinine level &gt; 1.5 X institutional ULN Hepatic Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X ULN OR Direct bilirubin ≤ ULN subject total bilirubin level &gt; 1.5 ULN AST ( SGOT ) ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 X ULN OR ≤ 5 X ULN subject liver metastasis Albumin &gt; 2.8 mg/dL Coagulation International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) Prothrombin Time ( PT ) ≤1.5 X ULN unless subject receive anticoagulant therapy long PT PTT within therapeutic range intend use anticoagulant Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time ( aPTT ) ≤1.5 X ULN unless subject receive anticoagulant therapy long PT PTT within therapeutic range intend use anticoagulant Creatinine clearance calculate per institutional standard . Female subject childbearing potential must negative urine serum pregnancy within 72 hour prior receive first dose study medication . If urine test positive confirm negative , serum pregnancy test require . Female subject childbearing potential must willing use 2 method birth control surgically sterile , abstain heterosexual activity course study 120 day last dose study medication ( Reference Section 7.4 ) . Subjects childbearing potential surgically sterilize free menses &gt; 1 year . Male subject must agree use adequate method contraception start first dose study therapy 120 day last dose study therapy . Has diagnosis immunodeficiency receive systemic steroid therapy form immunosuppressive therapy within 7 day prior first dose trial treatment . Subjects require systemic steroid exclude trial . The use physiologic dos corticosteroid may approve discussion sponsor . Has know history active TB ( Bacillus Tuberculosis ) Hypersensitivity pembrolizumab excipients . Has prior anticancer monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) within 4 week prior study Day 1 recover ( i.e. , ≤ Grade 1 baseline ) adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Has prior chemotherapy , target small molecule therapy , radiation therapy within 2 week prior study Day 1 recover ( i.e. , ≤ Grade 1 baseline ) adverse event due previously administer agent . Note : Subjects ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy alopecia exception criterion may qualify study . Note : If subject receive major surgery , must wait ≥ 3 week prior start study treatment . They must recover adequately toxicity and/or complication intervention prior start therapy . Has know additional malignancy progress require active treatment . Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma skin squamous cell carcinoma skin undergone potentially curative therapy situ cervical cancer . Has know active central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis . Subjects previously treat brain metastasis may participate provide stable ( without evidence progression image least four week prior first dose trial treatment neurologic symptom return baseline ) , evidence new enlarge brain metastasis , use steroid least 7 day prior trial treatment . This exception include carcinomatous meningitis exclude regardless clinical stability . Has active autoimmune disease require systemic treatment past 2 year ( i.e . use disease modify agent , corticosteroid immunosuppressive drug ) . Replacement therapy ( eg. , thyroxine , insulin , physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy adrenal pituitary insufficiency , etc . ) consider form systemic treatment . Has active infection require systemic therapy . Patients require supplemental oxygen exclude . Has history current evidence condition , therapy , laboratory abnormality might confound result trial , interfere subject 's participation full duration trial , best interest subject participate , opinion treat investigator . Has know psychiatric substance abuse disorder would interfere cooperation requirement trial . Is pregnant breastfeeding , expect conceive father child within project duration trial , start prescreening screen visit 120 day last dose trial treatment . Has receive prior therapy antiPD1 , antiPDL1 , antiPDL2 agent . HIV+ positive patient eligible CD4+ count ≥ 300/μL undetectable viral load . In addition , must currently receive Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy ( HAART ) care Infectious Diseases specialist . Patients hepatitis B hepatitis C must care viral hepatitis expert consultant . Patients hepatitis B require treat antiHBV treatment ( e.g. , entecavir ) . Patients hepatitis C need receive prior and/or ongoing hepatitis C treatment . Has receive live vaccine within 30 day plan start study therapy . Note : Seasonal influenza vaccine injection generally inactivate flu vaccine allow ; however intranasal influenza vaccine ( e.g. , FluMist® ) live attenuate vaccine , allow . Has history ( noninfectious ) pneumonitis require steroid current pneumonitis .</criteria>
