	<brief_title>Modified Wet Suction Versus Capillary Techniques EUS Guided Fine Needle Aspiration Biopsy Solid Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All adult patient undergo EUS solid lesion Loma Linda University Health gastroenterology lab . These patient recruit time precede endoscopy Gastroenterology lab . They explain goal , randomization , intervention study . The collected patient information , well step safeguard information , explain . Patients randomly assign capillary wet-suction technique arm accord computerized randomization program already generate . All patient undergo routine EUS possible moderate sedation general anesthesia , FNA/FNB . Cook Pro-core 22 gauge needle use procedure . For lesion undergo FNA/FNB procedure , total 4 pass make use select technique . The research aspect differentiate method tissue acquisition : modify wet-suction technique versus `` slow pull '' capillary technique . For modified wet-suction technique : 1 . The stylet remove onset procedure . It use unless necessary de-clog needle . Each de-clogging , necessary , note . 2 . 10 mL suction syringe fill saline use first prime needle 5 mL saline leave within syringe 3 . Then plunger withdrawn lock three-way stopcock establish vacuum . After initial step , syringe saline remove entirety procedure unless technical issue arise , e.g . de-clogging . 4 . Once needle introduce lesion interest , suction re-established opening three-way stopcock . 5 . 10-20 to-and-fro needle motion do , emphasize edge lesion fanning . 6 . At termination pas , three-way stopcock close prior withdrawal needle lesion , prevent suction specimen syringe . 7 . Prior step collect specimen , vacuum release , three-way stopcock turn open position . 8 . Then syringe plunger push collect first drop specimen onto glass slide smear ( thus make two glass smear pass , preserve alcohol ) , rest expunge onto formalin cell block . 9 . Then vacuum re-established noted step 3 , ready needle pass . 10 . For first three pass , collection smear cell block do . For last pas , specimen collect cell block . Thus 6 total slide ( number letter consecutively identification ) , 1 formalin jar cell block make patient/lesion . 11 . Again , unless technical issue arise , syringe remove initial prim do vacuum establish . Any technical issue note within procedure report . For capillary `` slow pull '' technique : 1 . With stylet slightly pull back , needle introduce lesion interest , time stylet push expunge contaminate material . 2 . The stylet slowly withdraw assistant completely remove . 3 . 10-20 to-and-fro needle motion do , emphasize edge lesion fanning . 4 . After removal needle lesion , stylet re-inserted . The first drop collect tissue smear , rest expunge first stylet , saline , air formalin jar cell block . 5 . Stylet re-introduced , ready pass . 6 . For first three pass , collection smear cell block do . For last pas , specimen collect cell block . Thus 6 total slide ( number letter consecutively identification ) , 1 formalin jar cell block make patient/lesion . Specimen handle : Tissue smear undergo Papanicolaou staining , tissue preserve 10 % formalin solution process cell block . The subject follow Gastroenterology Clinic and/or refer doctor . Patient may call receive letter regard pathology result follow-up needed , per routine</detailed_description>
