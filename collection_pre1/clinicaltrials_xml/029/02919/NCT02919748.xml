	<brief_summary>To evaluate efficacy choral singing prevention dementia examine underlie mechanism use Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) technique panel peripheral biomarkers venous blood urine . The investigator hypothesize Choral singing could prevent cognitive decline among community-dwelling elderly high risk dementia . The underlying neural mechanism involve change brain structure function quantify use MRI technique . The change cognitive outcome accompany observable change panel carefully select peripheral biomarkers .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cognitive function decline advance age prevalence incidence dementia rise dramatically late life . Impaired cognitive function limit one 's ability work , live socialize , represent major obstacle active aging . Data Asian country show clear role cognitive function contribute functional disability independent physical health . How maintain good cognitive health later stage life important challenge question require well-founded research good applicability . With cure dementia sight presently , vitally important find effective preventive measure . Candidates potential avenue intervention carefully evaluate well-designed randomized control trial ( RCT ) . Here investigator propose choral singing novel approach prevention cognitive decline dementia ; investigator plan test hypothesize efficacy RCT base select group senior Singaporeans Jurong Area . This propose research build grow body research evidence role choral sing health promotion psychological wellbeing ; fact trial test potential effectiveness choral sing delay cognitive decline onset dementia . The plasticity brain form scientific basis potential efficacy choral singing prevent cognitive decline incidence dementia . It well known participate various cognitive , social productive activity associate improved cognitive function low risk dementia . The protective effect cognition may particularly effective certain subgroup . For example , analysis local data show among single widow elderly , increase social engagement associate low risk cognitive impairment : compare subject low tertile social engagement score , adjust Odds Ratio ( OR ) cognitive impairment 0.50 subject second third tertile . Data previous clinical trial support cognitive training effective improve cognitive function delay cognitive decline elderly . Functional gain cognitive training report last five year , meta-analysis demonstrate protective effect cognitive train cognition healthy elderly persist year train . In Singapore , brain-computer interface base cognitive training system show promise improve memory attention healthy elderly . Specifically , train lead significant improvement immediate memory ( p = 0.038 ) , visuospatial/constructional ( p = 0.014 ) , attention ( p = 0.039 ) , delayed memory ( p &lt; 0.001 ) score . However , cognitive training base human trainer brain-computer interface expensive hence applicability preventive real world set general population largely limited . Participants training also may able maintain lasting interest motivation . Given consideration , relatively cost-effective captivate method urgently need believe choral singing promising candidate . In Singapore , 200 school choir . Most universities tertiary education institution choir develop expressive art form . Furthermore , numerous church choir sing spiritual passion , professional chorus select sing perform . The exist resource tap future large scale interventional initiative solid data efficacy produce rigorously design clinical study . In collaborative research project involve expert multiple discipline , investigator propose conduct randomize clinical trial examine clinical efficacy choral singing prevention cognitive decline dementia . As cognitive stimulating activity , choral sing involves cognitive process attention , memory , executive function language . As social activity , choral singing consist group interaction cultivate feel part meaningful community . Prior study demonstrate situation activity involve synchrony others induces feeling closeness affiliation , bolster coordination synchronization partner . Increased prosociality conformity produce synchrony may also apply people generally , even synchronization partner . Moreover , synchrony affiliative orientation also share bi-directional relationship , individual prone prosocial tendency likely synchronize others . As physical exercise , choral singing require involvement 100 muscle ; help improve lung function circulation , promote superior posture , boost balance resistance . Choral singing also require chorister cooperate , discipline listen blend fellow singer need persistently hard work stay par level singer . All may contribute long term cognitive benefit choral singing . Although theoretically plausible , effectiveness choral sing prevent cognitive decline dementia study scientifically . This propose study fill important knowledge gap . The investigator aim produce firm data two year efficacy choral singing prevent cognitive decline form evidence base research future interventional initiative .</detailed_description>
