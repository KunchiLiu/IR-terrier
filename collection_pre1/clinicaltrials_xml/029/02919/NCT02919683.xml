	<brief_summary>This research study study nivolumab , investigational drug , combination ipilimumab , also investigational drug , possible treatment Squamous Cell Carcinoma oral cavity . The following drug involve study : - Nivolumab ( Opdivo™ ) - Ipilimumab ( Yervoy™ )</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Window Study Nivolumab With Without Ipilimumab Squamous Cell Carcinoma Oral Cavity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study Phase II clinical trial . Phase II clinical trial test safety effectiveness investigational intervention learn whether intervention work treat specific disease . `` Investigational '' mean intervention study . The purpose study evaluate effectiveness ( well drug/s work ) Nivolumab Nivolumab combine Ipilimumab prior standard care surgery . Nivolumab Ipilimumab type immunotherapy . Immunotherapy work encourage body 's immune system attack cancer cell . Both nivolumab Ipilimumab demonstrate activate immune system attack cancer cell laboratory study patient different type cancer . Nivolumab ( Opdivo ™ ) approve US Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment metastatic melanoma ( type skin cancer ) , specific type previously treat advanced lung kidney cancer . Ipilimumab ( Yervoy™ ) approve FDA treatment metastatic melanoma . Because Nivolumab Ipilimumab help immune system work different way , combination Nivolumab Ipilimumab test laboratory study . The data study suggest give two drug together could benefit patient , indeed find case patient melanoma . The combination Nivolumab Ipilimumab FDA approve treatment patient metastatic melanoma . However , use Nivolumab well Ipilimumab alone combination treatment patient head neck cancer approve . Results clinical trial investigate safety efficacy Nivolumab Ipilimumab patient head neck cancer available time . In proposed study , either Nivolumab combination Nivolumab Ipilimumab test test prior surgery remove cancer oral cavity . By stimulate immune system attack cancer cell , drug may cause cancer decrease size prior surgery prevent cancer come back .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Pathologically confirm squamous cell carcinoma oral cavity . Clinical stage &gt; =T2 ( primary tumor great 2 cm size ) and/or evidence regional nodal involvement clinical exam image Only patient 18 year older eligible . There upper age limit patient must able medically tolerate regimen . Adverse event data currently unavailable use immune checkpoint blockade participant &lt; 18 year age , thus child exclude study ECOG performance status &lt; =1 Patients much surgical candidate ( e.g . disease must consider resectable treatment must serious medical contraindication definitively preclude undergo general anesthesia ) Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must agree use appropriate method ( ) contraception ( see Appendix B ) . WOCBP use adequate method avoid pregnancy 23 week ( 30 day plus time require nivolumab undergo five halflives ) last dose investigational drug . WOCBP define woman adolescent begin menstruation post menopausal . A postmenopausal woman define woman age 45 menstrual period least 12 month Women childbearing potential must negative serum urine pregnancy test ( minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L equivalent unit HCG ) within 24 hour prior start nivolumab Men sexually active WOCBP must agree use contraceptive method ( see Appendix B ) failure rate le 1 % per year . Men receive nivolumab sexually active WOCBP instruct adhere contraception period 31 week last dose investigational product Women childbearing potential ( ie , postmenopausal surgically sterile well azoospermic men require contraception ) Participants must normal organ marrow function define : Laboratory parameter : WBC ≥ 2000/uL , Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1500/mm3 ; Platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3 ; Hemoglobin ( Hgb ) ≥ 9 g/dL ; HgbA1C ≤ 7.5 % ; Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) ≤ 3 × upper limit normal ( ULN ) ; Bilirubin ≤ 2.5 × ULN ( ≤ 4 × ULN subject Gilbert 's disease ) ; Alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 × ULN ; Creatinine ≤ 1.5 × ULN Pathologically proven , radiologic clinical evidence distant metastatic disease ( include disease clavicle , well disease metastatic bone , brain , spinal canal ) Any prior immunologic cancer therapy systemic inhibitor PD1 CTLA4 pathway Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include limited ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement Individuals history different malignancy ineligible except follow circumstance : diseasefree least 2 year deem investigator low risk recurrence malignancy ; diagnose treat within past 2 year cervical cancer situ basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin Prior radiation head neck region Prior chemotherapy within last 2 year History pneumonitis interstitial lung disease Has evidence active , noninfectious pneumonitis require treatment steroid . Active , suspect prior document autoimmune disease require systemic treatment last 2 year immune modify agent ( e.g . replacement therapy thyroxine , insulin physiologic corticosteroid exclusion criterion ) . This include patient vitiligo type 1 diabetes mellitus , residual hypothyroidism due autoimmune condition require hormone replacement , psoriasis require systemic treatment , condition expect recur absence external trigger The subject know positive human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , HepBsAg , HCV RNA Lack availability follow assessment Concurrent administration cancer specific therapy course study allow Patients require systemic treatment either corticosteroid ( &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent ) immunosuppressive medication within 14 day study drug administration . Inhaled topical steroid adrenal replacement dos &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent permit absence active autoimmune disease History allergy study drug component History severe hypersensitivity reaction monoclonal antibody The investigator 's belief subject medically unfit receive nivolumab , and/or ipilimumab unsuitable reason Has receive live vaccine within 28 day plan start study therapy</criteria>
