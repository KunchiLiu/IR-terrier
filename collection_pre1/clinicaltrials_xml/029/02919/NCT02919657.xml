	<brief_title>Absorption Comparison Equivalency Value Genepro Gen2</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : To prove absorbability usability Genepro Gen2 Protein compare whey isolate . This study intend show equivalent value Genepro Gen2 compare whey protein isolate ( 1 tablespoon Genepro Gen2 compare 30g serve whey isolate ) Parameters : This study encompass 12-week program follow 20 gastric bypass patient undergone weight loss surgery . We take baseline blood analysis prior start study subsequently take weekly blood work chart register finding . For study weekly analysis blood protein level utilize Spectrophotometry . The target blood protein range 6.1-8.7 g/dL test administer fasting . Participants : 20 Post Op Gastric Bypass patient . 10 men , 10 woman . All participant age 30-46 year age . All participant post operation weight loss surgery minimum 3 month prior start study longer 12 month start study . Gathering Results : 10 subject receive Genepro Gen 2 protein ( 1 tablespoon serve ) first 6 week study last six week , receive 30g Whey protein . In conjunction group 10 subject receive 30g whey protein first 6 week study Genepro Gen2 protein final six week . Weekly blood analysis determine blood protein level . Diet : Diet guideline limit calorie consume provide balance meal help prevent nutritional deficiency preserve muscle tissue . Each patient tolerate suggest food differently . Daily calorie 600 700 duration study . Each subject follow diet low calorie , fat sweet . The goal subject consume minimum 65 75 gram protein day . High protein food include egg , meat , fish , seafood , tuna , poultry , tofu , milk , soy , cottage cheese , yogurt . 30g daily intake protein provide powdered protein supplement . Each subject utilize 30g serve whey isolate 6 week study 6 week subject use single serving ( 1tablespoon ) Genepro Gen2 Protein . Subject give follow eat guideline : - Eat slowly chew small bite food thoroughly . - Avoid rice , bread , raw vegetable , fresh fruit , meat easily chew pork steak . Ground meats usually well tolerate . - With soft solid food , take three bite one sitting , wait minimum 20 minute eat . - Eat balanced meal small portion . - Avoid use drinking straw carbonate beverage , chew gum ice introduce much air pouch cause discomfort . - Avoid sugar , sugar-containing food beverage , concentrated sweet , fruit juice Alcoholic beverages profound effect avoid consume caution . Exercise : Each subject ask exercise 30 45 minute day , cardio aerobic activity three five time week . Initially , recommend walk five minute morning five minute late afternoon . As tolerated increase interval five minute walk least 15 minute twice per day .</detailed_description>
