	<brief_title>Norwegian Pancreatic Cancer Trial ( NorPACT ) - 1</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pancreatic cancer fourth lead cause cancer-related death Europe United States . Surgical resection remain potentially curative treatment . However , median survival patient undergoing pancreatic resection alone 16-23 month . The administration adjuvant chemotherapy lead improvement overall survival . Thus , completion multimodality treatment ( MMT ) ideal goal standard care treatment pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( PDAC ) . Currently , surgery-first ( SF ) strategy universally accept approach resectable PDAC ( standard care Norway ) , optimal sequence surgery chemotherapy remain unclear . The purpose study investigate additional efficacy neoadjuvant chemotherapy standard treatment resectable cancer pancreatic head ( surgery follow adjuvant chemotherapy ) .</detailed_description>
