	<brief_title>Vaccination With Autologous Dendritic Cells Loaded With Autologous Tumour Homogenate After Curative Resection Stage IV Colorectal Cancer : Phase II Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vaccination autologous dendritic cell load autologous tumour homogenate curative resection stage IV colorectal cancer : phase II study . Primary objective : Safety Immunological efficacy , express number patient show enhancement proportion circulate immune effector specific select panel CRC-associated antigen . Secondary objective : Clinical outcome patient ( OS , RFS , TTR ) . To evaluate predictive role development positive DTH test least three vaccine administration . To evaluate persistence antitumor immune response completion vaccination program . To evaluate prognostic predictive role enhancement specific immune response . To evaluate panel inflammatory cytokine involve antitumor immune response . To evaluate predictive role immune cell tumour microenvironment . To evaluate predictive role tumour antigen expression . This two-stage , phase 2 clinical trial design accord Simon minmax design . A 40 % immune response rate would preclude study , 70 % immune response rate would indicate study would warrant . Given α β error 0.1 , first stage require enrolment 7 patient . If least 3 patient show immune response toxicity acceptable , study proceed second stage additional 12 patient enrol . The vaccine consider immunologically active least 11 patient immunological responder .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients must histologically confirm stage IV colorectal cancer surgically treat radical intent . 2 . The autologous surgical specimen must collect send Somatic Cell Therapy Lab IRST IRCCS must fulfil acceptance criterion prescribe GMP procedure . 3 . The patient must diseasefree , assess CT scan MRI chest , abdomen , pelvis perform within 60 day enrolment . If resect lesion occur site , must also include baseline CT scan subsequent evaluation . 4 . The patient must recover ( grade 1 less CTCAE 4.0 ) adverse event relate previous surgery . 5 . Age &gt; 18 year . 6 . ECOG performance status 0 1 . 7 . Patient must acceptable organ function , define : 1 . Haemoglobin &gt; 10 g/dl 2 . White blood cell ≥4000/μl . 3 . Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1500/μl . 4 . Platelets ≥100000/μl . 5 . AST ALT &lt; 3 time upper institutional reference level . 6 . Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 time upper institutional reference level . 7 . Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 time upper institutional reference level . 8 . Patients age 70 year old must leave ventricular ejection fraction lower 55 % assessed echocardiography . 9 . Female patient childbearing potential male patient must accept compliant highly effective contraceptive method ( i.e . failure rate &lt; 1 % per year : double barrier method , one barrier method plus spermicidal , intrauterine device , oral contraception ) inform consent signature three month end study . For purpose consider childbearing potential female subject puberty unless postmenopausal least two year surgically sterile . Complete abstinence sexual intercourse acceptable patient ' lifestyle guarantee his/her strict compliance prescription judgement Investigator . 10 . The patient willing able give write informed consent study . 1 . Patients residual disease surgery . Marginal resection lesion absence clinically evident residual disease acceptable . 2 . Patients relapse within 6 month since primary treatment stage IIII colorectal cancer . If adjuvant chemotherapy administer , term must compute since last chemotherapy dose . 3 . Patient complete surgery 60 day study enrolment . 4 . History neoplastic disease previous 5 year , except basal cell carcinoma skin situ carcinoma cervix uterus treat curative surgery . 5 . History congenital acquire immunodeficiency , include history organ transplantation . 6 . Any positivity serologic marker HBV ( include least antiHBs antibody antiHBc antibody ) , HCV , HIV Treponema pallidum . The serologic test must perform within 30 day GMPregulated activity ( i.e . surgical resection leukoaphaeresis ) . The sole positivity antibody HBV S antigen ( i.e . HBV marker negative ) indicative previous HBV vaccination therefore acceptable . 7 . Female patient pregnant nursing . 8 . Patients undergone surgery preoperatory chemotherapy fluoropyrimidine plus oxaliplatin , unless candidate postoperatory chemotherapy schedule opinion Investigator ( e.g . unacceptable toxicity ) refuse completion perioperatory treatment . 9 . Participation another clinical trial investigational agent within 30 day prior study screen . 10 . Any active inflammatory autoimmune disease require systemic steroid immunomodulatory agent detailed section 6.4 , potentially require treatment study treatment judgement Investigator . 11 . Any clinical condition , opinion Investigator Transfusion Medicine specialist , contraindication leukaphaeresis . In addition , patient age 70 old must evaluate cardiology specialist procedure exclude clinically relevant cardiac condition grade 34 cardiac arrhythmia , even asymptomatic . 12 . Any clinical condition , opinion Investigator , contraindicate subcutaneous administration lowdose IL2 per protocol ( see section 6.2 detail ) . 13 . Any uncontrolled serious intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation potentially impact patient safety compliance opinion Investigator . 14 . Refusal give write informed consent .</criteria>
