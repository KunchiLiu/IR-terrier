	<brief_title>A Study Evaluating Proprietary Amino Acid Mixture ( Enterade® ) Patients Receiving High-Dose Melphalan Conditioning Followed Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation Multiple Myeloma Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study Phase II clinical trial . Phase II clinical trial test safety effectiveness investigational intervention learn whether intervention work treat specific disease , case , side effect standard treatment Stem Cell Transplant side effect . `` Investigational '' mean intervention study . In research study , investigator evaluate Enterade/Placebo plus standard supportive care treatment side effect cause transplant . Enterade work rehydrating intestinal cell , thereby help restore normal bowel function . The ingredient Enterade generally recognize safe Food Drug Administration . This research study hop learn add Enterade standard supportive care regimen participant transplant help reduce side effect transplant .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must histologically cytologically confirm Multiple Myeloma , NonHodgkin Lymphoma must undergo Melphalan condition autologous HSCT . Age equal great 18 year old . ECOG performance status ≤2 ( Karnofsky ≥60 % ) Participants must adequate organ marrow function proceed transplant . Ability tolerate thin liquid mouth time admission . The effect Enterade® develop human fetus unknown . For reason therapeutic agent use trial know teratogenic , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) time study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Men treat enrol protocol must also agree use adequate contraception prior study , duration study participation , 4 month completion trial . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Participants radiotherapy within 4 week prior enter study recover adverse event due chemotherapy agent administered time period . Participants receive investigational agent . Participants receive standard care induction therapy clinical trial may eligible discussion overall principal investigator . Participants know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . Known allergy Stevia . Participants receive medication antibiotic treat Clostridium difficile infection prior initiation study ineligible study . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active Clostridium difficile infection history Clostridium difficile infection . Participants evidence diarrhea define three loose liquid stool per day loose watery stool ( great volume stool ) , occur frequently usual lasting three day prior admission , history inflammatory bowel disease , irritable bowel syndrome , colectomy bariatric surgery , Celiac disease . Participants psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant nursing woman exclude study teratogenicity toxicity risk associate condition regimen patient undergo autologous HSCT .</criteria>
