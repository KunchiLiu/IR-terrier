	<brief_title>Attentional Capacity Clinician Performance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Attentional capacity number item person hold temporal memory whilst undertake task ( researcher equivocate Random Access Memory compute hardware ) . Therefore , attentional capacity think play role task performance person 's attentional capacity measure 'in-vivo ' one predict person 's ability aptitude ( classify expert novice since expert require full capacity temporal capacity , many routine step store permanent memory ) . The measurement performance interest medical training competency test research . Eye-tracking novel method could offer new effective component measure performance complex procedure . These novel method increasingly spot new healthcare research study aim use multitude purpose , mostly uncover valuable insight different participant performance level . One form medical training high-fidelity virtual reality simulator provide almost life-like training environment trainee one common use simulator surgical training . Some work eye-tracking already do surgical task indicate visual attention discriminate novice expert level performance . There scope use eye-tracking technology capture visual attention complex surgical procedure uncover discriminatory measurement participant different level expertise . Aims The first aim study investigate relationship attentional capacity performance cardiology-based procedure . The hypothesise significant relationship find attentional capacity statistically significant predictor discriminate expert novice . The second aim study investigate relationship visual attention ( record via eye track ) precisely record action take participant procedure . A third aim study investigate relationship physiological metric ( Heart rate , GSR record via E4 wristband ) precisely record action take participant procedure . This facilitated capture participant 's visual attention , worn eye-tracking glass , level arousal , worn GSR/EDA wristband verbalisation ( thinking-aloud task performance ) , record video/microphone , two simulate cardiology-based procedure . The simulator provide metric ( duration etc . ) represent participant ' performance procedure . The simulation provide state art surgical simulator ASSERT Centre , University College Cork . An extra display monitor also include provide extra stimulus assess attentional capacity . The monitor display specific play card certain time proceeding . The participant acknowledge card . This visual attention capture provide insight participant ' attentional capacity .</detailed_description>
