	<brief_summary>Introduction : course research , investigator develop decision-support system ( comorbidity-DSS ) consist ( 1 ) knowledge base ( KB ) consist ( ) computer-interpretable clinical guideline type 2 diabetes 2 disease : obstructive pulmonary disease , osteoporosis , hypertension , osteoarthritis ; ( b ) ontology relevant general medical knowledge could complement ( ) order propose non conflict treatment option mention clinical practice guideline ; ( 2 ) algorithm match KB patient 's data set identify guidelines-based recommendation applicable patient interaction propose way mitigate conflict interaction ( e.g. , suggest select intervention A.2 ( instead A.1 ) guideline A intervention B.3 ( instead B.1 ) guideline B together action B ' mention general medical knowledge , intervention conflict yet A.3 fulfills goal intervention A.1 intervention B.3 + B ' together fulfill goal B.1 ) . Research purpose : Assessing correctness completeness detection recommendation-interaction generation conflict-free recommendation comorbidity-DSS Research question : How usage comorbidity-DSS affect completeness correctness clinician regard ( ) detection interaction recommendation originate different clinical guideline applicable patient comorbidities ( b ) identification intervention fulfill guideline ' goal conflict .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The protocol follow . 1 . In consultation 3 expert clinician , investigator create database patient scenario . The investigator obtain deidentified extract medical record 6-12 typical patient type 2 diabetes least one follow comorbidities : obstructive pulmonary disease , osteoporosis , hypertension , osteoarthritis obtain . The data obtain include relevant observation , medication , procedure regard patient . Relevancy determine clinical practice guideline above-mentioned disease , specify data collect patient . The data include information could identify patient , date birth , name , identification number , street address , telephone number . The patient case assemble database scenario , decompose several step , step take place different point along clinical guideline 's timeline compose several decision-points regard goal clinical guideline . In total , would 60 decision point across patient scenario . 2 . Validation KB creation gold standard . The three experience clinician validate KB also create gold standard set interaction recommendation decision point patient scenario well set recommendation fulfill clinical guideline ' goal decision point conflict-free . 3 . Recruiting study participant . The investigator send invitation 50 clinicians/medical student order recruit least 30 participant experiment . The participant ask solve ( detect interaction propose non conflict intervention ) six scenario . Anticipated time solve case : 3 hour + 1 hour introduction sign consent document . 4 . Crossover study design use compare effect use comorbidity-DSS detection recommendation interaction generation correct non-conflicting recommendation . Each participant give 6 scenario : 3 solve aid system 3 without . Each scenario present clinician series single step . In DSS-mode clinician present output comorbidity-DSS step , include list interaction recommendation originate different clinical guideline set non-conflicting recommendation fulfill goal relevant decision point/goal . They need say interaction non-conflicting recommendation whether accept reject , possibly add free text ; non-DSS mode , clinician need provide set detect interaction propose non-conflicting recommendation step , free text . 5 . While gold standard interaction recommendation would create ahead time three clinician RAMBAM step 1 , possible comorbidity-DSS study participant identify additional interaction non-conflicting recommendation . The three clinician review well could potentially revise gold standard include rich set interaction non-conflicting recommendation set . Based revise gold standard , completeness correctness interaction detect non-conflicting recommendation generate participant calculate , use comorbidity-DSS vs. without different step ( decisions/goals ) . The overall completeness correctness percentage , thus range 0 1 , relative extend gold standard . 6 . Statistical analysis do follow . Assuming total completeness correctness two dependent variable , bound variable zero 1 . Thus , beta regression model logit link function use mean response model ; log link function fit precision model . This model base assumption dependent variable beta-distributed mean relate set regressors linear predictor unknown coefficient link function . The full model shall include three factor : ( 1 ) DSS mode ( DSS Non-DSS ) , ( 2 ) Level training ( e.g. , 1st year resident , experienced resident , specialist ) , ( 3 ) Scenario ( different scenario use ) . The pseudo R2 value ( square correlation linear predictor link-transformed response ) use measure overall goodness fit model . A backward elimination algorithm use assess important factor . Unlike total completeness measure , compute overall set decision-points per scenario per clinician , investigator also analyze completeness measure decision-point ( e.g. , `` order lab test '' ) , increase resolution look clinician 's guideline-based action per decision ; therefore , measure variable binary , logistic regression logit link function use . As previous case , full model include three factor ; backward elimination algorithm use reach final model .</detailed_description>
