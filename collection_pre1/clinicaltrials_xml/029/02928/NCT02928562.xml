	<brief_summary>Rehabilitation total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) consider control postoperative pain swell , protection healing graft , restoration full range motion symmetric contralateral knee , strengthen muscle stabilize knee , hip , trunk , enhance neuromuscular control , gradual progression functional activity require return normal daily life . The effect concomitant injury surgical procedure must also consider plan individualized rehabilitation program . However , still unclear regard optimal exercise prescription TKA . In current study , investigator plan develop exercise protocol evaluate result multidisciplinary approach , i.e . bone mineral density assessment . The exercise prescription consist cyclic exercise , aerobic exercise resistant training exercise first , second third year , respectively . Cyclic exercise advantage safety effectiveness hydraulic resistance equipment , well exercise quantitatively determine . Aerobic exercise privilege cardiopulmonary endurance improvement , along muscle strengthen associate muscle group . Resistance exercise specify indicated muscle group , especially knee extensor , flexor , ankle plantar flexor dorsi flexor TKA reconstruct patient . The investigator hypothesis use cyclic exercise process improve body composition , muscle strength , bone mass density , level oxidative damage indicator , gait performance , quality life , knee joint range motion , function cardiopulmonary fitness . This project establish scientific basis rehabilitation protocol involve knee surgery .</brief_summary>
