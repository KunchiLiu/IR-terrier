	<brief_summary>Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) frequent primary tumour liver third cause cancer-related mortality worldwide . Depending stage disease , treatment option surgery , liver transplantation , chemotherapy radiotherapy . Recently , scientific research focus small molecule call microRNAs produce human cell release blood . They role cell proliferation find dysregulated different type cancer . It show microRNAs role development HCC unknown molecule use marker diagnosis survival HCC . In particular , microRNAs miR-221 miR-222 dysregulated tumoral tissue 80 % patient HCC . This assessed tissue liver biopsy surgical specimen , invasive approach . Only study show presence microRNAs blood patient HCC unknown correlation tumoral tissue expression circulating level . The aim study evaluate two microRNAs express tumoral tissue also blood cancer patient , different amount compare circulating level healthy individual . A correlation tumoral tissue blood level also evaluate . Should evaluation show strong correlation reliability circulate microRNAs diagnosis follow HCC , future clinical trial target microRNAs relate pathway might benefit adopted conventional practice instead need assess tissue level liver biopsy .

	<brief_title>Clinical Significance Hepatic Circulating microRNAs miR-221 miR-222 Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Background &amp; Rationale Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) sixth prevalent cancer worldwide , third cause cancer-related mortality . Surgical resection remain best curative treatment option patient clinical Barcelona-Clinic Liver Cancer ( BCLC ) stage A disease show benefit even advance stage B multifocal disease limit vascular invasion . Despite curative treatment offer 5-year survival rate 50-70 % , recurrence rate 5 year surgery high 70 % . Therefore , effort need order identify prognostic factor recurrence survival . MicroRNAs class small non-coding RNAs molecule , act key regulator cell proliferation , differentiation , apoptosis embryonic development , finely tune gene expression post-transcriptional level . They act oncogenes tumor suppressor depend target gene . In HCC , report upregulation downregulation cluster microRNAs , subsequent activation molecular network b-catenin , Ras , TGF-b , JAK/STAT creation highly control feedback mechanism . Their involvement carcinogenesis represent important area investigation development clinical application : diagnostics , monitor therapeutic . MicroRNA profile distinguish normal cancerous tissue , identify tissue origin also discriminate different subtypes specific oncogenic abnormality . Indeed , microRNA mis-expression pattern accurate identify origin tumour otherwise difficult determine , suggest tumour clearly maintain unique tissue microRNA expression profile . MicroRNAs could also useful early diagnosis biomarkers patient follow-up . In liver tumorigenesis , role miR-221 miR-222 completely elucidate . Previous study show miR-221 upregulated 83 % HCC tumoral sample compare match cirrhotic tissue . Increased expression serum miR-221 find HCC patient compare healthy normal control , associate presence poor prognostic factor poorer outcomes liver resection . The extraction microRNAs liver sample limit ability resect tumour possibility perform liver biopsy patient . On contrary , blood sample easy collect stored analysis . At present , clearly establish correlation expression miR-221 miR-222 liver tissue ( tumoral non tumoral ) circulate miR-221 miR-222 level . The confirmation correlation , would allow identify cutoff circulate level could use surrogate marker order include HCC patient phase 3 trial without need liver biopsy , often contraindicate clinical reason accord guideline . This pilot study evaluate correlation overexpression miR-221 miR-222 pair tumoral/non tumoral liver tissue blood sample patient HCC identify cutoff circulating level use surrogate marker clinical trial . This study therefore aim evaluate miR-221 miR-222 expression blood correlate tissue expression circulating level could use surrogate overexpression tumoral liver tissue . Should evaluation show strong correlation reliability circulate miRNAs , diagnosis follow HCC , future clinical trial target miRNAs relate pathway might benefit adopted conventional practice instead need assess tissue level liver biopsy . The trial conduct compliance principle Declaration Helsinki , principles GCP ( ) applicable regulatory requirement essential . NHS Grampian Biorepository provide anonymised sample use study . NHS Grampian Biorepository already ethical approval place types study . Research Development approval seek . 2 . Methods Blood sample patient HCC age-matched healthy control , store National bio-repository Scotland , test circulate miR-221 miR-222 expression mean Real Time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction ( RT-qPCR ) . Similarly , level miR-221 miR-222 assess paired cancer healthy liver tissue form patient HCC . Sample analysis take place Institute Health Wellbeing Research laboratory Robert Gordon University ( RGU ) - Aberdeen . Results analysis sample quantification microRNAs via RT-qPCR carry chief investigator along research team laboratory facility . Samples analyse assess miR-221 miR-222 overexpression tumoral non tumoral liver tissue ass correlation circulate miR-221 miR-222 . Circulating level compare result age-matched healthy control . The custodian data generate study Chief Investigator . Samples store laboratory facility RGU chief investigator research team access . Data generate study collect spreadsheet bespeak held intranet access restrict CI research team . Anonymised data computer file store password-protected database accessible study investigator . All write file store locked filling cabinet within secure store Robert Gordon University exception consent store NHS Grampian Biorepository . The University Aberdeen NHS Grampian monitoring procedure follow . At end research sample store research team pending ethical approval use another project , whereas data generate study store password-protected database accessible study investigator . 3 . Consent Process NHS Grampian Biorepository seek inform consent patient collection tissue sample blood dedicate research nurse use patient information sheet consent form part NHS Grampian Biorepository documentation . A consent obtain sample use study accord Biorepository consent process . 4 . Trial Flowchart - Five frozen pair hepatic tumoral non tumoral tissue five frozen plasma sample obtain patient HCC store National Bio-Repository Scotland ( HCC Group , HCC ) . Five voluntary age-matched healthy control recruit relate expression circulate miRNAs ( Plasma Control Group , PCG ) . - Paired frozen HCC tissue specimens adjacent non-cancerous normal liver collect RNA Stabilisation tube store -80C analysis miRNAs extraction per protocol . The average size specimen 2 10 mm diameter . - Blood sample collect HCC Group PCG ( 8-10ml , BD Vacutainer K3-EDTA blood collection tube ) collect . All sample send Bio-Repository processing analysis miRNAs extraction per protocol . - The result miRNAs extraction pair HCC/non-cancerous tissue compare HCC Group plasma compare matched plasma control ( PCG Group ) .</detailed_description>
