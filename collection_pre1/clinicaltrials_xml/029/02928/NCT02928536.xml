	<brief_title>The TackSHS Survey : Pan-European Study SHS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study characteristics The TackSHS survey face-to-face population-based cross-sectional survey conduct 12 select European country , coordinate Dr Silvano Gallus , Department Epidemiology `` Mario Negri '' Institute ( Milan , Italy ) . Background Exposure secondhand smoke ( SHS ) serious adverse health effect adults child , cause 600,000 death year worldwide . Estimates prevalence non-smokers expose SHS range 20 % 60 % various European country . The WHO recommend develop smoke-free policy protect non-smokers SHS exposure . E-cigarettes irrupted market last 5 year , sale popularity considerably grow European Union ( EU ) . Approximately 7 % Europeans ever use e-cigarettes . TackSHS new research project fund European Commission ( EC ) within Horizon 2020 programme ( grant agreement : 681040 ) . Within TackSHS Project , select work package ( WP ; i.e. , WP3 , WP9 WP10 ) involve conduction survey 12 EU country : TackSHS survey . Objectives Objectives cross-sectional study include : ) estimate prevalence , investigate individual-level country-specific determinant , smoking , e-cigarette use , exposure SHS e-cigarette aerosol select European country ( WP3 ) ; ii ) analyze attitude , perception behaviours adult European population towards policy limit SHS exposure ( WP3 ) ; iii ) compare select smoking-related data collect TackSHS survey companion pan-European survey conduct 2010 ( WP3 ) ; iv ) ass morbidity mortality select respiratory cardiovascular disease attributable SHS exposure among adults child European population ( WP9 ) ; v ) quantify economic burden associate exposure SHS e-cigarette aerosol Europe ( WP10 ) . Methods The cross-sectional survey conduct 12 European country ( Bulgaria , England , France , Germany , Greece , Ireland , Italy , Latvia , Poland , Portugal , Romania , Spain ) , represent geographical , legislative cultural variation across EU . In 12 selected country , approximately 1000 individual , representative general population age 15 year enrol . The final sample therefore include total approximately 12,000 subject . The sample size specific country allow u obtain prevalence estimate maximum standard error ( SE ) low Â± 1.6 % . Therefore , sample size able provide stable prevalence estimate ( relatively small 95 % confidence interval ) , overall , also specific country . Survey participants satisfy follow inclusion criterion : ) 15 year age ; ii ) residence one 12 selected country ; iii ) ability understand answer question questionnaire study country-specific language ; iv ) formal acceptance participate study . The multi-stage methodology use preferred sample methodology , method , include stratified simple sample quota method , also accept wherever possible conduct multistage random sample . Participants survey trained interviewer face-to-face interview use structured standardized questionnaire , include information : ) socio-economic demographic characteristic ; ii ) cigarette smoke habit e-cigarette use ; iii ) SHS e-cigarette aerosol exposure different site ; iv ) attitudes perception smoke-free regulation . Whenever possible , data collect within computer assist personal interview ( CAPI ) . Alternatively , paper pencil ( P &amp; P ) interview accept . Once fieldwork complete , data check coherence presence possible error , clean , finalize single dataset expert biostatisticians Department Epidemiology `` Mario Negri '' Institute . According statistical analysis , within WP3 univariate multivariate ( i.e. , multiple logistic regression ) analyse consider identify sub-groups population cluster country frequently expose SHS passive exposure emission e-cigarettes . Moreover , evaluate change time select smoking-related aspect , TackSHS data compare data previous companion European survey ( PPACTE survey ) . Within WP9 , use specific algorithm , possible estimate attributable mortality morbidity SHS Europe , take advantage : ) prevalence figure tobacco smoke SHS exposure ThackSHS survey select European datasets ; ii ) morbidity mortality figure WHO source ; iii ) quantification association SHS exposure risk SHS-related disease scientific literature review . Within WP10 , use SHS exposure figure TackSHS survey , Return On Investment model develop assess cost-effectiveness , budget impact wider set social return investment metric select policy aim reduce exposure SHS across European country . Ethical Issues Although EU country , accord current legislation , mandatory type study ( i.e. , population-based cross-sectional survey ) obtain either formal approval study protocol ethic committee write consent sign survey participant , follow request European Commission , satisfy ethical requirement . Thus , evaluation Italian Ethics Committee ( i.e. , Ethics Committee study coordinator ) , study protocol submit evaluation Ethics Committees 11 country data collect . Moreover , formal consent ( signature case P &amp; P interview ) obtain adult participant , , case minor one parent legal tutor . All data manage anonymously , respect privacy regulation force , scientific purpose , without lucrative aim . These measure agreement national current forthcoming EU ( i.e. , Directive 95/46/EC ) regulation . Relevance , implication dissemination Thanks TackSHS survey , provide characterization exposure SHS e-cigarette aerosol population different socioeconomic level various European country . We also provide first estimate morbidity mortality due SHS exposure European level , cost impact intervention control SHS exposure purpose-built economic model . The main finding TackSHS survey disseminate international peer-reviewed open-access journal TackSHS Project website ( www.tackshs.eu ) , present national international conference .</detailed_description>
