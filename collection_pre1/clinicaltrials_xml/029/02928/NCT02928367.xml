	<detailed_description>Rationale : Community-acquired pneumonia ( CAP ) represent major health care problem mortality morbidity associate severe pneumonia remain considerable , despite state art care . While role alter DNA methylation cancer widely study , knowledge impact antibacterial defense highly limited . In addition , recent preclinical study show gut respiratory microbiota contribute host defense bacterial pneumonia . This study aim explore completely novel research area link extent DNA methylation blood leukocyte ( monocyte neutrophils ) function gut respiratory microbiota influence innate immune responses host defense CAP . Primary Objectives : 1 . To obtain insight role alter DNA methylation blood leukocyte ( monocyte neutrophils ) innate immune response host defense patient CAP . 2 . To determine composition function gut respiratory microbiota patient CAP . Secondary Objective : 1 . To assess influence gut microbiota leukocyte DNA methylation patient CAP Study design : Observational study among patient CAP Emergency Department Internal Medicine Ward Academic Medical Center Amsterdam Study population : 231 CAP patient 115 healthy subject 18 year age . Methods : From mention patient healthy volunteer , maximum 90 ml blood drawn analyze DNA methylation pattern purify monocyte neutrophil , analyzed connection DNA methyltransferase ten eleven translocation ( TET ) activity , RNA gene expression selection standard innate immune function test . Moreover , isolated monocyte neutrophils admission sample stimulate vitro Streptococcus pneumoniae Klebsiella pneumoniae . In addition , rectal nasopharyngeal swab obtain investigate role gut respiratory microbiota composition function . Patient material obtain upon inclusion day 28 , patient see outpatient clinic follow . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : Participating observational study benefit participant healthy volunteer . The study provide information influence leukocyte DNA methylation well gut respiratory microbiota host defense mechanism CAP . The knowledge obtain potentially benefit CAP patient future provide alternative immune modulate treatment option modify host response . The burden risk patient participate ELDER-BIOME study minimal . The investigator take 90ml blood , 4 rectal swab 2 nasopharyngeal swab divide two time-points ( day presentation day 28 post presentation ) . Healthy volunteer subject one blood draw ( 70 ml ) 2 rectal - 2 nasopharyngeal swabs one time-point .</detailed_description>
