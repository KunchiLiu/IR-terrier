	<brief_title>Combining Sunitinib , Temozolomide Radiation Treat Patients Diagnosed With Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) , common primary brain tumor adult know highly invasive angiogenic profile . Despite advance different modality GBM treatment , overall prognosis GBM remain dismal . The current standard care Radiation Therapy ( RT ) dose 60 Gy ( 30 fraction ) 6 week concurrent Temozolomide ( TMZ ; 75 mg/m2 daily 6 week ) follow adjuvant TMZ ( 150/200mg/m2 daily , 5 28 day x 6 month ) . The DNA repair protein O6-methylguanine methyltransferase ( MGMT ) remove alkyl adduct O6 position guanine therefore counteracts cytotoxic effect alkylating agent TMZ . Thus , GBM patient harbor tumor unmethylated MGMT promoter increase MGMT protein expression derive benefit TMZ treatment . Sunitinib ( Sutent , SU11248 ) oral multitargeted receptor tyrosine kinase ( RTK ) inhibitor anti-angiogenic activity . Sunitinib approve FDA treatment patient gastrointestinal stromal tumor disease progression intolerance imatinib , treatment patient advance renal cell carcinoma treatment patient unresectable , locally advanced , metastatic well-differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor ( pNET ) . Previous pre-clinical data show efficacy sunitinib GBM . The investigator preclinical data highlight differential effect sunitinib GBM MGMT-positive tumor great response sunitinib combination RT TMZ compare MGMT-negative tumor . In phase II trial , Investigator test efficacy safety combine Sunitinib RT TMZ newly diagnose GBM patient display tumor unmethylated MGMT promoter . Based investigator preclinical finding , patient MGMT ( + ) tumor ( derive benefit TMZ treatment ) likely respond sunitinib-based therapy . MGMT promoter methylation therefore use biomarker selection newly diagnose GBM patient enrol study .</detailed_description>

No active bleeding pathologic condition carry high risk bleeding ( e.g . tumor involve major vessel know varix ) Patients undergone resection must meet following condition : Patients must recover effect surgery minimum 14 28 day must elapse day surgery day registration . Day registration consider first day Sunitinib . For stereotactic biopsy , minimum 14 day must elapse prior registration No prior RT brain , chemotherapy , antiangiogenic therapy Estimated life expectancy least 6 month Premenopausal woman must negative human chorionic gonadotropin within 14 day prior registration The effect Sunitinib develop human fetus unknown . Women childbearing potential male participant must practice adequate contraception . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant study , inform treat physician immediately .

HIVpositive patient combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction Sunitinib . In addition , patient increase risk lethal infection treat bone marrowsuppressive therapy Individuals MRI noncompatible metal body , unable undergo MRI procedure .
