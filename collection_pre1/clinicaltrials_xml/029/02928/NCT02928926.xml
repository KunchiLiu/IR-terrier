	<brief_title>Cerebral Haemodynamics Stroke Thrombolysis Study ( CHIST )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In UK alone , approximate 100,000 people suffer stroke year . Improved management stroke patient reduce morbidity mortality , also reduce cost long term social care . The brain control system ( i.e . cerebral autoregulation ) maintain blood flow brain , relatively wide blood pressure range . Cerebral Autoregulation describe static , reflect integrity mechanisms time , dynamic , occur response sudden fluctuation perfusion pressure . When blood pressure drop , small artery increase size restore flow level , blood pressure rise , narrow protect delicate blood vessel . know sudden decompensated blood pressure change occur stroke , could result brain bleeding swell reduce blood flow brain . It know clotbusting agent ( Alteplase ) , main effective treatment use acute stroke improve blood flow already block artery 50 % patient . However , powerful drug dissolve clot , risk may cause bleeding ( haemorrhage ) body . This serious occur brain , either region stroke another part brain , serious , could lead great disability even death . To date , little information regard natural history prognostic significance impair cerebral autoregulation follow restoration brain blood flow ( reperfusion ) , especially receive clotbusting agent ( Alteplase ) . There also conflict finding animal human model . There evidence animal study restoration blood flow postischaemic brain artery may result generation free oxygen radical , lead cerebral autoregulation impairment . Furthermore , evidence animal model clotbusting agent ( Alteplase ) may exhibit additional blood vessel toxic effect therefore , impair cerebral autoregulation . However , finding could reproduce human setting . To date , one small study look cerebral autoregulation 14 acute ischaemic stroke patient 8 day clotbusting treatment , study assess blood flow regulation initiation completion clotbusting treatment . Cerebral autoregulation assess noninvasively use Trans Cranial Doppler ( TCD ) . This mean use ultrasound probe side head measure change blood flow one main brain artery ( middle cerebral artery ) response beat beat change dynamic cerebral autoregulation . However , use TCD may limit absence brain window and/or occlusion middle cerebral artery acute ischaemic stroke patient . Therefore , important consider alternative site middle cerebral artery ass brain blood flow regulation , group previously research use main neck artery ( internal carotid artery ) site . In healthy control population , brain blood flow regulation index ( autoregulation index ) estimate internal carotid artery statistically different middle cerebral artery . However , comparison make acute ischaemic stroke population . This research use noninvasive technique Trans Cranial Doppler look blood flow regulation brain ( cerebral autoregulation ) clotbusting therapy ( thrombolysis ) treat acute ischaemic stroke ( AIS ) patient initiation completion thrombolysis , acute , subacute chronic phase post stroke onset , compare AIS patient similar age , sex blood pressure treat thrombolysis . This study provide important data regard peri-thrombolysis blood pressure management , important common clinical dilemma .</detailed_description>
