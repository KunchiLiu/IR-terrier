	<detailed_description>Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) one common form cancer second lead cause cancer-related death western world , account annual death 215.000 european 2012 estimate 50.310 Americans 2014 . Sporadic CRC develop accumulation genetic epigenetic alteration epithelial cell-lining . These alteration think push normal epithelial cell adenoma-carcinoma sequence . Detection hypermethylated DNA make blood stool cancer patient believe , hypermethylated cell-free DNA blood stool use cancer biomarker , exhibit high sensitivity specificity CRC major cancer-types ( e.g . lung , prostate , breast cancer ) . Hypermethylated cell-free DNA - measure plasma - could prove specific sensitive biomarker CRC detection blood stool CEA blood CRC patient . The aim project examine hypermethylation specific gene measure cell-free DNA plasma CRC patient diagnostic biomarker CRC . The result study show , single blood sample differentiate patient CRC patient without cancer . Development reliable sensitive specific biomarker CRC immensely improve diagnostics handle CRC patient . To propose sensitive specific hypermethylated DNA promoter region CRC detection , review literature currently available undertaken . The following search criterion ( MeSH term ) use : `` colorectal neoplasm '' , `` DNA methylation CpG island '' , `` tumour stool sample blood serum plasma '' , `` real time PCR microarray analysis genome sequence biopsy blood analysis '' . Based review literature review write : `` DNA Methylation Blood Stool Screening Prognostic Marker Colorectal Cancer '' . Epigenetics study heritable change gene expression , arise due change DNA sequence . Epigenetic alteration include micro-satellite instability , histone modification DNA methylation . DNA methylation normal phenomenon eukaryotic cell occur across whole genome . Methylation target cytosine-residues follow guanine DNA strand ( call CpG-islands ) convert methyl-cytosine . Un-methylated CpG-islands exist high concentration promoter region human gene , DNA promoter hypermethylation lead decreased transcriptional activity . This event happen tumour suppressor lead gene silence relate tumour genesis . CpG-Island hypermethylation show non-random process pattern gene hypermethylation appear specific individual cancer . This lead definition CpG-Island Methylator Phenotype ( CIMP ) CRC , panel gene hypermethylated CRC tumour , grow body literature correlation hypermethylated gene CRC . This investigation primarily focus DNA obtain CRC biopsy recent year focus move hypermethylated DNA obtain blood stool sample . Hypermethylated gene analyse blood CRC patient e.g . SDC2 , THBD , HIC1 , RASSF1A . Hypermethylated SEPT9 analyse large prospective study evaluate performance screen marker , reveal sensitivity 48.2 % specificity 91.5 % . However hypermethylated promoter region analyse concert others part biomarker panel , markedly well performance report . A biomarker panel compose RASSF1A , APC , MGMT , Wif-1 reach sensitivity 86.5 % specificity 92.1 % CRC detection . From study , apparent profile hypermethylated DNA blood sample CRC patient different profile measure healthy control . Only two study conduct , prospectively study relationship DNA hypermethylation measure blood CRC patient risk cancer recurrence . These study limit analyse single gene promoter region ( p16 ) low number study participant . The study show hypermethylated DNA detect blood CRC patient , promote biomarker CRC . No study however prospectively analysed performance accord treatment relapse disease CRC patient . Studies hypermethylated DNA stool CRC patient conduct use single gene hypermethylation marker . The gene primarily analyse hypermethylated VIM also commercially available kit stool analysis . The focus stool study DNA hypermethylation screen marker CRC . One study combine iFOBT test hypermethylation PHACTR3 gene , extract iFOBT fluid . A positive result least one two test raise sensitivity 95 % ( 19/20 ) high specificity 94 % ( 45/48 ) CRC advance adenomas . Most method analysis require bisulfite conversion DNA detection methylated cytosine , Pedersen et al . ( 2012 ) recently publish article address key time-consuming step lower analysis-time increase recovery sparse amount DNA ( &lt; 0.1 ng/ml ) , render test clinically applicable . In summary , DNA collect blood stool sample CRC patient analyse purpose discovering hypermethylated gene CRC specific . Hypermethylation specific gene blood sample associate poor prognosis ( p16 , HLTF , TMEFF1 , ALX4 , VIM , FBN2 ) , early diagnosis ( APC , TAC1 , SEPT9 , NEUROG1 , RASSF1A , SDC2 , THBD ) potential recurrence marker CRC patient ( p16 TFPI2 ) . Especially THBD SDC2 show great promise marker early stage CRC , fact seem possible use DNA methylation blood marker disease recurrence warrant research , use gene individually concert others . Hypermethylation DNA stool sample CRC patient analyse thoroughly blood sample , though detection hypermethylated DNA fragment stool sample could use screen CRC . SFRP2 , TMEFF2 , SPG20 , TFPI2 , PHACTR3 show promise detection CRC early stage premalignant lesion . The fact PHACTR3 could detect iFOBT-fluid ( reach increase sensitivity specificity ) indicate possible new screen method , DNA hypermethylation analyse one stool sample . There however issue regard analytical sensitivity hypermethylated DNA stool-samples CRC patient . The diagnostic sensitivity right-sided tumour low left-sided tumour suggest DNA degradation colonic lumen stool excretion . This promote blood medium choice detection hypermethylated gene biomarkers diagnosis , prognosis recurrence detection CRC . METHOD AND STUDY PARTICIPANTS 1 .
