	<brief_summary>Pancreatitis remain common complication ERCP , report incidence range 2 % 9 % . Although 80 % case mild , significant number patient may develop severe pancreatitis , mean additional morbidity risk death . ERCP , despite development new diagnostic tool , remain widely use procedure , post-ERCP pancreatitis problem significant impact . Several study meta-analyses help u recognize special factor put individual high risk development post-ERCP pancreatitis . Among factor special interest present history post-ERCP pancreatitis independent risk factor new episode post-ERCP pancreatitis . It seem individual genetically predispose susceptibility particular complication . The aim present study investigate possible genetic variation associate post-ERCP pancreatitis use whole genome sequencing .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study include patient high risk post-ERCP pancreatitis . Blood sample gather investigate possible genetic variation associate post-ERCP pancreatitis use whole genome sequencing . DNA whole genome sequencing extract use DNA extraction kit ( Qiagen Inc. , Hinden , Germany ) concentration &amp; purity DNA measure use Nanodrop ( Nano Drop Technologies , Wilmington , DE , USA ) fluorometric quantitation ( Qubit fluorometer ) . Genetic variation associate acute pancreatitis search use whole genome sequencing . Post-ERCP pancreatitis primary outcome . Medical record data genetic variation review identify possible risk factor genetic variation associate post-ERCP pancreatitis .</detailed_description>
