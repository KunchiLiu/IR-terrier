	<brief_summary>This research trial study mechanisms idelalisib-associated diarrhea patient chronic lymphocytic leukemia , indolent non-hodgkin lymphoma , small lymphocytic lymphoma come back period improvement . The cancer treatment drug idelalisib trigger diarrhea patient . Studying stool , blood , tissue sample lab patient give idelalisib may help doctor learn side effect may help treat future patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mechanisms Idelalisib-Associated Diarrhea Patients With Relapsed Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia , Indolent Non-hodgkin Lymphoma , Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To explore cellular molecular mechanism idelalisib-induced diarrhea/colitis relapse chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) , relapse indolent non-hodgkin lymphoma ( iNHL ) , relapse small lymphocytic lymphoma ( SLL ) . II . To understand mechanism action ( MOA ) idelalisib context nodal microenvironment possible involvement immune system idelalisib 's anti-lymphoma activity . OUTLINE : Patients receive physical examination visit 1 . A stool sample , blood sample , 6 biopsy collect visit 2 , patient undergo flexible fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy . Patients receive idelalisib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) visit 2 . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . A third research visit occur upon development idelalisib-associated diarrhea/colitis symptom . Patients diarrhea/colitis symptom undergo full colonoscopy collection stool blood sample . Control patient diarrhea/colitis symptom undergo need test assessment include flexible fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy collection stool blood sample . All patient undergo optional biospecimen collection time disease progression .</detailed_description>
