	<brief_summary>The goal study determine whether exposure blue spectrum light reduces acute kidney injury systemic inflammation subject undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass . Subjects schedule undergo cardiopulmonary bypass surgery expose either bright ( 1000 lux ) blue spectrum ( 480nm ) light ambient , white fluorescent light 24 hour photoperiod day prior surgery 24 hour photoperiod immediate postoperative period .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Light modifies biology physiology mammal , include human . The cellular biology immune system , well , cell comprise tissue organ ( e.g. , kidney , liver ) regulation light exhibit circadian rhythm . Studies show severity organ injury varies time day , duration day , season . This variation due biology circadian rhythm , light principle environmental cue entrain circadian biology . More recent data suggest modulating spectrum light organism expose may therapeutically modulate cellular response stress injury . Specifically , exposure short ( 24 hour ) photoperiod high illuminance , blue spectrum light attenuate liver kidney injury animal subject ischemia/reperfusion ( I/R ) , model blood flow organ temporarily reduce restore . A predominant cause organ injury model misdirect exacerbated inflammation type immune cell call neutrophil . However , blue light inhibit neutrophil infiltration ischemic kidney liver , thereby reduce inflammation neutrophil-mediated organ injury . Cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) surgery operation characterize excessive inflammation high risk organ injury , particularly acute kidney injury ( AKI ) . Thus , hypothesize exposure blue light , comparison standard environmental , white fluorescent light , reduce inflammation , organ injury improve outcome patient undergoing CPB .</detailed_description>
