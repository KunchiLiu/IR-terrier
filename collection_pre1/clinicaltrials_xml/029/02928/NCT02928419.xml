	<brief_summary>Myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) prevail elderly patient characterize inefficient erythropoiesis peripheral cytopenia . Supportive care still represent main therapeutic option patient . Quality life deteriorate mostly anemia limitation due dependence transfusion , thrombocytopenia , neutropenia . The treatment available severe thrombocytopenia consist PLT transfusion , mainly presence bleeding . In patient low intermediate-1 risk MDS isolate deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality , red blood cell ( RBC ) transfusion-dependence prevalent condition . For latter patient reach transfusion-dependence , lenalidomide , immunomodulatory drug , approve FDA EMA . It show drug induces significant erythroid ( 65 % ) cytogenetic response associate survival benefit . In patient MDS del5q serum erythropoietin level &gt; 500 miU/L , lenalidomide dose 10 mg/day 21 day every 28 , rather 5 mg dose , induce high rate transfusion-independence cytogenetic response trend survival advantage . As consequence , recommend start dose lenalidomide 10 mg orally daily day 1-21 repeat 28-day cycle . Lenalidomide treatment must start Absolute Neutrophil Counts ( ANC ) &lt; 0.5 Gi/L and/or PLT count &lt; 25 Gi/L . For patient dose initially 10 mg experience thrombocytopenia &lt; 25 Gi/L ( 45-75 % ) , recommend interrupt lenalidomide treatment PLT count return ≥ 25 Gi/L least 2 occasion ≥ 7 day PLT count recovers ≥ 50 Gi/L time , resume lenalidomide 50 % dose reduction . Eltrombopag orally bioavailable agonist thrombopoietin receptor . It show patient affect MDS acute myeloid leukemia , Eltrombopag neither increase proliferation , clonogenic growth capacity bone marrow blast . Furthermore , Eltrombopag induce increase megakaryocytic differentiation formation normal megakaryocytic colony . These result provide rationale pursue research Eltrombopag treatment thrombocytopenia case MDS . Preliminary result ongoing randomized trial , EQoL-MDS , evaluation efficacy , safety eltrombopag thrombocytopenia low intermediate-1 IPSS risk MDS show eltrombopag able significantly raise PLT count 65 % patient without additional toxicity Furthermore , combination lenalidomide eltrombopag result significant inhibitory effect growth leukemic colony majority primary MDS AML sample . Most importantly , eltrombopag able reverse anti-megakaryopoietic effect lenalidomide primary MDS patient sample . These result provide preclinical rationale use combination MDS AML</brief_summary>

Absolute Neutrophil Counts ( ANC ) ≥ 0.5 GiL Resistant refractory erythropoetic stimulating agent ( ESAs ) and/or serum erythropoetin level &gt; 500 miU/L Subjects must ineligible relapsed refractory receive treatment option azacitidine decitabine . Subjects must PLT count RBC PLT transfusion data available period 8 week prior screen . During 2 month prior randomization , subject must baseline BM examination include follow : cytomorphology , cytogenetics histology ECOG Performance Status must 03 . The following clinical chemistry MUST NOT exceed upper limit normal ( ULN ) reference range : creatinine , ALT , AST , total bilirubin ( except Gilbert 's Syndrome ) , gammagt alkaline phosphatase . In addition , albumin must lower limit normal ( LLN ) 10 % . If subject meet criteria childbearing potential : 1 . Negative pregnancy test female subject within 3 day prior Day 1 1st cycle effective contraception least 4 week . 2 . Subject practice acceptable method contraception ( documented chart ) . Female subject ( female partner male subject ) must either nonchildbearing potential ( hysterectomy , bilateral oophorectomy , bilateral tubal ligation postmenopausal &gt; 1 year ) , childbearing potential use highly effective method contraception 2 week prior administration study medication , throughout study , 28 day completion premature discontinuation study . Criteria woman nonchildbearing potential : A female patient female partner male patient consider childbearing potential unless meet least one follow criterion : 1 . Age ≥ 50 year naturally amenorrhoeic ≥ 1 year ( amenorrhoea follow cancer therapy lactation rule childbearing potential ) . 2 . Premature ovarian failure confirm gynaecologist 3 .
