	<brief_title>The Associations Between Sedentary Behaviour Impact Characteristics Bone Health</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Significant proportion adult engage sedentary behaviour prolong period time generally regard deleterious effect health . However , far less know specific effect bone health . Exercise propose method improve bone health , impact force generate foot contact ground physical activity potential aid bone maintenance development . The property bone regulate amount mechanical loading , frequency load duration loading endure , create osteogenic effect . These variable quantify via accelerometry record magnitude , rate duration acceleration experience site body accelerometer worn . Although vast amount literature accelerometer use monitor physical activity , lack study use accelerometer determine effective exercise bone , especially relation lumbar spine . Exploring bone health load characteristic sedentary low highly active non-sedentary individual provide evidence upon base future intervention likely benefit bone health sedentary population .</detailed_description>
