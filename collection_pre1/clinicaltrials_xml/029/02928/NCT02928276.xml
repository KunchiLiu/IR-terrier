	<brief_title>Prediction Response Anti-TNFs DMARDs Based RheumaKit Â® Platform ( RK-Tx-01 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current standard therapeutic strategy RA patient initiate DMARDs therapy , ( e.g . MTX ) serious side effect . This also apply PSO SNSA patient . MTX however inefficient 40 % case . Other treatment ( biological DMARDs ) must thus initiate , overall similar effectiveness side effect high cost ( around 13kEUR/year/patient ) . Therapeutic choice base symptom blood test include marker inflammation inadequate predict disease evolution response treatment . Improving RA management require improve adequacy therapeutic strategy . The early disease correctly address , likely progression irreversible damage joint limit . DNAlytics recently develop RheumaKit differential diagnostic solution UA patient . UA condition joint inflammation present , precise diagnosis make , due lack sensitivity presently available diagnostic technique . RheumaKit multi-gene expression solution discriminate RA joint condition . A diagnostic model train identify patient suffer RA , SNSA OA . RheumaKit diagnostic accuracy high 90 % , performance well diagnostic solution design , include ACR/EULAR 2010 criterion diagnosis RA . See work principle . Beyond diagnosis , DNAlytics want make RheumaKit evolve towards treatment recommendation application ( theranostic application ) patient eligible biological DMARDs . On one hand , diseases patient describe term activity several metabolic pathway ( T &amp; B cell activation , Extra cellular matrix , Inteferon , TNF ) . On hand , exist treatment also describe term pathway target . The RheumaKit signature contain many marker representative pathways interest . RheumaKit thus provide snapshot activity seven metabolic pathway know literature relate disease mechanism , target exist treatment . In study , DNAlytics want show base score defined RheumaKit platform , response non- response anti-TNFs , represent large category biological DMARDs , predict treatment initiation .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must satisfy follow criterion : Signed ICF cover health insurance . At least 18 year old . For woman , use reliable method birth control remain abstinent study , surgical sterilization woman 60 year age . Having undergone least 3 month synthetic DMARD treatment strictly eligible ( diagnosed RA ) stable dose least last month , show satisfactory response therapy . Be eligible biological DMARD treatment accord local regulation practice . Willing able comply schedule visit , treatment plan , test protocol procedure . Patients must satisfy none follow criterion : Arthritis history longer 5 year . Biological DMARD therapy already initiate . Be diagnose septic arthritis . Be pregnant breastfeeding/lactating woman . Diagnosed HIV , hepatitis B , hepatitis C , Crohn 's disease , fibromyalgia . Diagnosed inflammatory arthritic syndrome RA . chronic pain condition would confound evaluation patient . Be identify high risk biopsy biologic therapy . Be identified psychological , familial , social geographical condition could potentially hamper compliance study protocol followup schedule .</criteria>
