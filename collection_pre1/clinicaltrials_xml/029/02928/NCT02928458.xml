	<brief_summary>This research study patient adhesive small bowel obstruction ( ASBO ) . ASBO condition small intestine get block due scar call adhesion . To see blockage , contrast agent give x-ray take belly ( abdomen ) . MD Gastroview omnipaque two contrast agent may give part normal care ASBO . This study hop see one good .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Financial Impact Evidenced-Based Adhesive Small Bowel Obstruction Management Protocol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Small bowel obstruction common general surgical diagnosis provide significant proportion ( 16 % ) emergency general surgery admission . Unfortunately , paucity clear , well defined management protocol common problem result wide array management technique use general surgeon . It already show CT scan IV contrast accurate method identify strangulate bowel , diagnosis require urgent surgical intervention ( 4 ) . There variability aspect treatment arm ASBO , rather variability find medical management ASBO . Nasogastric tube ( NGT ) decompression universal component non-operative management duration NGT therapy definition fail medical management require surgery lack clear consensus . It aspect management ASBO I hop good define . Water soluble contrast ( MD-Gastroview ) show diagnostic therapeutic management ASBO decreasing length stay patient population . Not expedite resolution ASBO , also yield objective evidence whether ASBO resolve medical management alone , therefore decrease delay inevitable surgical intervention . The hypothesis study implementation evidence base adhesive small bowel obstruction protocol reduce length stay reduce financial burden health care system regard common general surgical problem . A second hypothesis MD-Gastroview omnipaque similar property regard diagnostic therapeutic impact ASBO .</detailed_description>
