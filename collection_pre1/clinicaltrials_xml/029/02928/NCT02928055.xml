	<brief_summary>The primary objective RCT explore mechanism Hemiplegic Shoulder Pain ( HSP ) reduction due treatment peripheral nerve stimulation . We explore association subject-specific clinical demographic information pain relief PNS . We explore possible role central sensitization mechanism perpetuate pain via measure sensory pain perception . Lastly , explore dose-response association muscle-contraction PNS pain reduction , completion activity daily live ( ADLs ) , improvement quality life .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Peripheral Nerve Stimulation Shoulder Pain : Dose Response</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hemiplegic shoulder pain ( HSP ) affect 60 % moderate severely impaired stroke survivor . HSP associate poor rehabilitation outcome , include interference activity daily live ( ADLs ) poor quality life ( QoL ) . While many treatment HSP propose , result long-term relief pain . The investigator develop use intramuscular peripheral nerve stimulation ( PNS ) treatment HSP , involve temporary placement percutaneous intramuscular electrode stimulate axillary nerve motor point deltoid muscle . The deltoid muscle stimulate 6 hour per day 3 week , cause comfortable , non-fatiguing contraction . This treatment , occur community set , result pain relief 12 month compare treatment hemisling . A systematic review randomize controlled trial ( RCT ) pain primary outcome conclude intramuscular PNS treatment provide long-term relief pain HSP . We complete two RCTs demonstrate short-term PNS treatment ( i.e. , 3 6 week ) provide pain relief . The first trial demonstrate efficacy long-term pain relief 60 % subject great 12 month . The second trial corroborate find 60 % subject receive PNS achieve long-term pain reduction , also show PNS reduces pain achieved physical therapy . The mechanism action PNS reduction HSP yet know . Thus , primary objective RCT explore mechanism HSP reduction . The mechanism behind PNS treatment HSP known . First , individual variation may contribute response PNS , thus explore association subject-specific clinical demographic information pain relief PNS . Secondly , team others find chronic stage central sensitization mechanism may also role perpetuate pain , form chronic shoulder pain . These mechanism explore via measure sensory pain perception . Finally , approach deliver PNS HSP different treatment PNS deliver skin surface electrode ( e.g. , transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation TENS ) treatment produce repeat muscle contraction course week . Treatments TENS generate tingle sensation ( paresthesia ) painful area , pain relief follow stimulation short-lived , seldom lasting hour . We postulate long-term pain relief HSP PNS treatment due repeat muscle contraction occur daily course treatment , thus explore dose-response association muscle-contraction PNS pain reduction , completion activity daily live ( ADLs ) , improvement quality life .</detailed_description>
