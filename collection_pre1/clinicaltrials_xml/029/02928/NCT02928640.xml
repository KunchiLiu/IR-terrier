	<brief_title>ClariCore Optical Biopsy System Used TRUS ( Trans-Rectal Ultrasound ) -Guided Prostrate Biopsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study collect information prostrate tissue biopsy use ClariCore System . The ClariCore system design improve tissue sample collect prostrate use light sensor ( fiber optic ) see change tissue . Researchers study data collect light sensor ( optical reading ) develop method ( like mathematical equation ) use tell difference normal cancerous prostrate tissue biopsy . What researcher hop learn study light guide biopsy procedure improve accuracy prostrate biopsy sampling .</detailed_description>
