	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether single intracoronary infusion adenovirus serotype 5 virus express gene human fibroblast growth factor-4 ( Ad5FGF-4 ) effective improve angina-limited exercise duration , angina functional class , frequency angina attack , frequency nitroglycerin usage , quality life . Half study participant receive Ad5FGF-4 , half receive placebo . The primary endpoint change baseline Month 6 Exercise Tolerance Test ( ETT ) duration . Long-term safety Ad5FGF-4 also assess .</brief_summary>
