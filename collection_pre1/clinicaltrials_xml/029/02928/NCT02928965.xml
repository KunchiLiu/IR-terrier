	<brief_title>The Benefit Minocycline Negative Symptoms Schizophrenia : Extent Mechanisms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Negative symptom psychosis respond traditional therapy first- second-generation antipsychotic among main cause decrease quality life observe individual suffer disorder . Minocycline , broad-spectrum tetracyclic antibiotic display neuroprotective property suggest new potential therapy negative symptom . In two previous clinical trial compare minocycline placebo , add standard care , patient receive minocycline show increased reduction negative symptom . Three route neuroprotection minocycline identify : neuroprotection grey matter loss , anti-inflammatory action stabilisation glutamate receptor . However , yet certain extent benefit minocycline psychosis mechanism . This proposal multi-centre double-blind randomise placebo-controlled clinical trial entitle The Benefit Minocycline Negative Symptoms Psychosis : Extent Mechanism ( BeneMin ) . Methods After provide informed consent , 226 participant early phase psychosis randomise receive either 100 mg modified-release capsule minocycline similar capsule placebo 12 month addition standard care . The participant test outcome variable intervention period . The extent benefit test via clinical outcome measure , namely Positive Negative Syndrome Scale score , social cognitive functioning score , antipsychotic medication dose equivalent level weight gain . The mechanism action minocycline test via blood screen circulate cytokine magnetic resonance image three-dimensional T1-weighted rapid gradient-echo , proton density T2-weighted dual echo T2*-weighted gradient echo planar image N-back task rest state . Eight research centre teh United Kingdom ( UK ) 15 National Health Service Trusts Health Boards involve recruit participant , perform study analyse data .</detailed_description>
