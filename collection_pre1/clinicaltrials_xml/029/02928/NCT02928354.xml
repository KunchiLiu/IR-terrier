	<brief_title>A Study Assess Effect Particle Size AZD7594 Pharmacokinetics ( PK ) After Single Inhaled Dose When Administered Using Dry Powder Inhaler Healthy Volunteers .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study comprise : - A Screening period maximum 28 day . - Three treatment period subject resident prior even meal 1 day dose AZD7594 ( Day -1 ) least 48 hour dose ; discharge morning Day 3 . Subjects return ambulatory visit 72 , 96 , 144 240 hour dose , ( Day 4 , Day 5 , Day 7 Day 11 respectively ) . - A final Follow-up Visit within 10 day last administration AZD7594 . This visit coincide last PK sample collection Day 11 last Treatment Period . There minimum wash-out period 21 maximum 28 day dose administration . Subjects attend Screening Visit within 28 day receive first dose AZD7594 , find eligible , return Treatment Period 1 , baseline assessment , randomize one 6 treatment sequence . For Treatment Period , subject receive investigational medicinal product ( IMP ) dose morning Day 1 , assessment 48 hour dose ( residential period ) return study center ambulatory visit 72 , 96 , 144 240 hour dose , ( Day 4 , Day 5 , Day 7 Day 11 respectively ) . Each subject receive AZD7594 single inhale dose 440 µg ( nominal dose ) follow treatment , administer via Dry powder inhaler ( DPI ) : - Treatment A : Particle size Large - Treatment B : Particle size Medium - Treatment C : Particle size Small Each subject involve study 12 week ( 4 week enrollment 8 week active study Follow-up ) .</detailed_description>
