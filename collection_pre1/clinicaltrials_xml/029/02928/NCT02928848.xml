	<detailed_description>Primary Progressive Aphasia ( PPA ) neurodegenerative condition characterize insidious irreversible loss language ability . Prior study suggest transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) direct toward language area brain may help ameliorate symptom PPA . In current study , investigator examine whether tDCS could use enhance language ability ( e.g. , picture name ) individual PPA variant primarily characterize difficulty speech production ( non-fluent logopenic ) . Participants recruit Penn Frontotemporal Dementia Center receive 10 day real sham tDCS ( counter-balanced , full-crossover design ; participant na√Øve stimulation condition ) . A battery language test administer baseline , immediately post-tDCS ( real sham ) , six week twelve week follow stimulation . Real tDCS may improve language performance individual PPA . Specifically , investigator expect tDCS effective people whose baseline performance worse base previous research . Severity deficit baseline may important factor predict patient respond positively language-targeted tDCS therapy .</detailed_description>
