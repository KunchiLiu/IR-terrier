	<brief_title>Mobilization Immediate After Abdominal Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There approximately 600 000 surgery perform year Sweden . Advances surgical technique lead complex surgery patient serious comorbidities . This , turn , lead long operation , expose patient longer period anesthesia . During anesthesia , muscle relaxant use , diaphragm relaxed abdominal content press muscle lung tissue behind . This combination surgery , supine position immobilization longer period time , negative impact functional respiratory capacity ( FRC ) even surgery . The ability cough eliminate produced secretion remain airways increase risk airway closure . Therefore , risk postoperative pulmonary complication ( PPC ) pneumonia , atelectasis ( collapsed airway lung ) respiratory insufficiency , considerable . Mobilization ( sit , stand walk ) believe improve normalize breathing surgery . However , isolated effect mobilization immediately surgery previously study . Hypothesis We hypothesize immediate mobilization ( within 2 hour ) abdominal surgery reduce postoperative respiratory insufficiency . Points inquiry 1 . Can mobilization mobilization breathing exercise ( Positive expiratory pressure ( PEP ) prevent postoperative respiratory insufficiency ? 2 . Can mobilization mobilization breathing exercise ( PEP ) reduce prevalence postoperative pneumonia , shorten time recovery unit total length stay hospital ? Methods A randomize control trial conduct evaluate whether mobilization immediately open abdominal surgery reduce postoperative respiratory insufficiency . Patients A total 200 Swedish-speaking , adult patient ( ≥18 year ) plan elective open abdominal surgery surgery time exceed 2 hour Karolinska University Hospital Solna eligible consecutive enrollment study . Patients walk independently exclude . Procedure All patient arrive postoperative recovery unit surgery randomization take place . Patients consider need non-invasive ventilation immediate surgery , mobilization contradict due surgical procedure , arrive recovery unit 6 pm , consider randomization . Patients randomize either : 1 . Mobilization within 2 hour surgery - sit 1-3 hour chair interspaced 1 hour bedrest day surgery 2 . Mobilization within 2 hour surgery - sit 1-3 hour chair interspaced 1 hour bedrest day surgery + breathing exercise PEP 3 . No mobilization - lay sit bed maximum 30° elevation head rest . No mobilization bed 4 hour . The study intervention continue 4 hour patient receive treatment transfer back surgical ward . Data collection Baseline data age , sex , weight , smoke history , comorbidities , American Society Anesthesiologists ( ASA ) -classification , peripheral oxygen saturation ( SpO2 ) result spirometry measurement collect meeting anesthesiologist outpatient clinic two week prior surgery . Treatment- patient care data need analgesic , blood pressure , heart rate , respiratory rate continually register bedside case report form . Time , duration frequency mobilization also register study protocol . Finally , information death , respiratory complication pneumonia , patient ' length stay recovery unit hospital obtain medical chart . Outcome assessment The primary outcome occurrence respiratory insufficiency define arterial oxygen pressure ( PaO2 ) &lt; 8 kilo pascal ( kPa ) ( 6,7 ) , measure via arterial blood gas sample , peripheral oxygen saturation ( SpO2 ) &lt; 90 % , measure peripherally pulse oximeter . Secondary outcome change arterial carbon dioxide pressure ( PaO2 ) , arterial oxygen pressure/fraction inspire oxygen ( PaO2/FiO2 ) ( arterial blood gas sample ) time group ; lung function assess inspiratory vital capacity ( IVC ) , force vital capacity ( FVC ) , force expiratory flow one second ( FEV1 ) peak expiratory flow ( PEF ) micro spirometer ; number patient respiratory insufficiency , define SpO2 &lt; 90 % , PaO2 &lt; 8kPa and/or PaCO2 ≥6.5kPa measure without oxygen supply ; postoperative pneumonia total length stay ward hospital . Statistical analyse The number patient required establish statistical power 80 % significance level 5 % , 63 patient group . Parametric non parametric analysis use depend data level . Clinical significance If fairly simple cheap intervention , mobilization immediately open abdominal surgery , lead less postoperative complication , shorten stay postoperative recovery unit , hospital total , include routine postoperative care . Ethical consideration The project approve Regional Ethical Review Board Stockholm ( Dnr : 2015/703-31/1 ) . The patient receive verbal write information study inform consent form obtain participant .</detailed_description>
