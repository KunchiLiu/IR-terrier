	<detailed_description>Study design This quasi-experimental pilot study part research study call `` ACTION FOR HEALTH ( Adolescents Children Training InterventiON FOR HEALTH ) '' , develop youth gender ( 7-15 year-olds ) . It multicomponent intervention program promote PA class nutrition education , base behavior change Ecological Model . This information hypothesis study . ACTION FOR HEALTH study approve Ethics Committee Center Health Sciences Federal University Paraíba- Brazil ( UFPB ) . The parent participant sign consent term . Study sample The project announce public private school João Pessoa ( Brazil ) , well print ( newspaper ) electronic ( social network ) medium . 59 youth volunteer , 43 child adolescent ( 7-13 year-olds ) meet eligibility criterion . 8 complete study protocol . So , 35 comprise sample evaluation protocol . Participants divide two group : intervention group ( INT , n = 17 , 7 boy ) attend least 75 % PA class meet 50 % food goal ; control one ( CONT , n = 18 , 6 boy ) , minimum less 49 % attendance PA class , involved nutrition education program . Methodologies study preparation intervention The program develop 4 teacher , 7 graduate student , 1 nutritionist , 2 graduate Nutrition student , 1 cardiologist , participate weekly meeting methodology intervention session prepare tested . During test period , activity would promote great adherence student list . Additionally , participant randomly use heart rate monitor ( Polar Team2 Pro , Polar , Finland ) accelerometer ( Actigraph , GT3X model ) , order record activity promote significant increase heart rate moderate vigorous PA intensity . Physical exercise intervention The exercise session take 90 minute , order assure least 60 minute physical exercise , 12 week . The session always teach staff , compose : 10 minute warm-up ; 30 minute circuit training ; 15-minute pre-sports recreational game ; 5 minute rest activity . Warm-up include aerobic/anaerobic recreational activity . The circuit , divide 6 station , include activity prioritize conditional and/or coordinative physical capacity , accordingly purpose proposed session day , participant could maintain high intensity throughout circuit . In first month , duration circuit station 30 second , increase 45 second 60 second , second third month , respectively . The transition time station keep 30 second throughout intervention . Finally , low-heart rate activity carry , game music stretching . The intensity training session define heart rate ( HR ) average 65 % maximum heart rate participant . Nutritional education intervention The dietary intervention , design nutritionist staff , consist two action . The first trough monthly event throughout intervention , one begin month , participation participant ' parent . The second action consist achievement 3 dietary goal ( easy , average hard goal ) child adolescents meet month intervention . These goal add intervention , begin 1st month intervention participant three goal meet , begin 3rd month , 9 goal . They also receive worksheet record meet minimum ( 1 star ) , average ( 2 star ) maximum ( 3 star ) daily goal . Parental support Simultaneously , exercise session offer parent order encourage family participation intervention perform child adolescent . The activity carry volunteer PA teacher center sport UFPB . Study variables Sexual maturation Each participant self-assessed stage secondary sexual characteristic : breast development stage woman pubic hair male ( TANNER , 1962 ) . The correlation self-assessment sexual maturity state evaluation perform parent 78 % female 90 % male . This variable used confounder statistical procedure . Anthropometric measure Height , determine stadiometer `` Holtain '' , follow standard procedure Lohman ( 1988 ) . Two measurement perform , record meter near millimeter , consider arithmetic mean two measurement . Body composition measure 4-hour-fasting low water intake , , bioimpedance scale use ( Inbody 720 , Biospace Co. , Ltd. ) determine body weight fat mass . Metabolic variables Blood sample participant collect nocturnal 12 hour-fasting , laboratory specialist , peripheral puncture cubital vein . The analysis CT , HDL-C , triglyceride , glucose carry spectrophotometry ( Cobas Integra 400 Plus ) Roche® kit . The LDL-C fraction indirectly calculate use Friedewald formula ( 1972 ) . The aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) level determine enzyme kinetic assay spectrophotometrically obtain centrifugation 10 minute / 3500 rpm . Insulin determine Luminex-100 IS ( Integrated System : Luminex Corporation , Austin , TX , USA ) , use Linco Human Gut Hormone panel kit ( Linco Research Inc. , MO , USA ) . The insulin resistance determine HOMA-IR . Physical activity sedentary behavior PA measure accelerometer ( Actigraph , GT3X model , Florida ) . The participant use accelerometer 10 consecutive day , also receive instruction correct use device . At time explanation visual demonstration proper use device , participant receive list instruction , along diary activity require record wear non-wear time instrument , also habitual physical activity . Data reduction perform Actlife software , version 6.11.7 . For validation data , least 4 day record least 8 hour per day ( 480 minute / day ) consider 40 . Of 4 day , 2 day correspond intervention 2 without intervention ( 1 weekend day ) . The time non-use estimate base period 20 consecutive minute zero . For data download , 15 second epochs perform , base recommendation similar population . The useful non-time determine accord Troiano ( 2007 ) . The cutoff point determine time spend different intensity PA follow standard propose Evenson et al ( 2008 ) . To determine time spent physical activity /week intensity necessary perform calculation generate weight average minute / day , PA intensity . Time spent moderate-to-vigorous physical activity correspond sum moderate physical activity ( AFM ) vigorous physical activity ( AFV ) value . Health related Physical Fitness Health relate Physical Fitness component evaluate different test Fitnessgram battery test ( 1999 ) ALPHA battery test , protocol perform internationally similar population . Thus , cardiorespiratory fitness ( CRF ) measure use test-run Suttle 20 m. The test complete participant fail reach final line simultaneously audio signal two consecutive occasion , end test due fatigue . Muscle strength upper limb measure handgrip dynamometer adjustable pinch ( TKK 5101 Grip D ; Takey , Tokyo Japan ) , conduct twice hand record maximum score achieve kilogram . For analysis , calculate mean value measurement hand . Muscle strength lower limb assess Jumping test foot together . The participant leap forward much possible , stable , non-slip surface . The test perform twice best score record centimeter . Abdominal strength endurance measure repetition abdominal test , participant perform maximum possible number sit-up , maximum 75 one minute . Trunk strength flexibility assess trunk extension test . There perform two attempt validate best one . Flexibility low limb assess sit-and-reach test , perform two attempt leg use average value two attempt leg . Body composition measure body mass index ( BMI ) , calculate use formula ( weight / height ) 2 . Motor fitness evaluate Koordinations Test für Kinder Tests - KTK battery test , recommend evaluation motor component balance , coordination , speed agility , child . Food consumption Food consumption carry 24-hour recall . Participants , along parent inform food consumption past two weekday one weekend day evaluation . Data three day tabulate software `` Virtual Nutri '' , calculate total energy consumption value three day . For analytical procedure , calculate average caloric intake among three measurement .</detailed_description>
