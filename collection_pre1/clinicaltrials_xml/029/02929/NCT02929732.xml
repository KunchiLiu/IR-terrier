	<brief_summary>Willis-Ekbom disease ( WED ) , also know restless legs syndrome ( RLS ) common neurological sensorimotor disorder typically impairs sleep quality life , likely consequent central dopaminergic dysfunction associate brain iron deficiency . Periodic limb movement ( PLMS ) sleep present 80 % patient WED. PLMS often associate micro-arousals contribute sleep fragmentation repeat increase blood pressure heart rate throughout night , thus represent increase risk hypertension cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . Willis-Ekbom disease affect people high cardiovascular risk factor , advanced age , obesity , diabetes mellitus hypercholesterolemia . However , previous observational , cross-sectional longitudinal population-based study association RLS CVD hypertension show controversial result . While pathophysiology RLS yet elucidate likely multifactorial , one theory involve reduction dopaminergic outflow preganglionic sympathetic neuron dorsal horn spinal cord . Dopamine inhibit preganglionic sympathetic neuron , therefore reduction dopamine may turn increase sympathetic outflow . Based notion , investigator hypothesize increase sympathetic autonomic activity Willis-Ekbom disease responsible recurrent increase blood pressure heart rate sleep , may play role increase risk cardiovascular disease . The aim study analyze autonomic nervous activity patient WED compare healthy volunteer control . The investigator measure primarily cardiac sympathetic activity 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine ( 123I-MIBG ) scintigraphy secondarily sympathetic nerve activity microneurography , plasmatic pro inflammatory biomarkers urinary catecholamine level circadian variation blood pressure heart rate assess 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring .</brief_summary>
