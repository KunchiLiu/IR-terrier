	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate possibility treat Hemiplegic Shoulder Pain ( HSP ) use transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) patient follow stroke . The secondary aim see treatment affect motor function upper limb , asses different type HSP whether correlation location extent stroke .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>tDCS Treat Hemiplegic Shoulder Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hemiplegic Shoulder Pain ( HSP ) common entity follow stroke . It 's prevalence varies study , probably include many etiology one way diagnosis . HSP delay rehabilitation , elongate hospitalization time reduce quality life . Currently one reccomended treatment HSP . Weak transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) induce persist excitability change human motor cortex . effect depend stimulation polarity specific site stimulation . Interacting cortical activity , mean cortical stimulation , improve rehabilitation potential neurologic patient . In respect , preliminary evidence suggest cortical stimulation may play role treat aphasia , unilateral neglect , chronic pain disorder . In tDCS study investigator use one anode one cathode electrode place scalp modulate particular area central nervous system ( CNS ) . The stimulation administer via neuroConn DC.Stimulator . The DC-STIMULATOR micro-processor-controlled constant current source . The DCSTIMULATOR CE-certified medical device conduct non-invasive transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) people.Electrode positioning determine accord International EEG 10-20 System .</detailed_description>
