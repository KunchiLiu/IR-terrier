	<brief_summary>Peripherally inserted central catheter , PICC line , successfully use many year , especially chemotherapeutic treatment oncologic patient parenertal nutrition . The implantation PICC line mostly perform x-ray ( fluoroscopy ) . The aim clinical study ass safety efficacy SHERLOCK-Systems eliminate confirmatory chest x-ray exposure . Additionally , SHERLOCK-System immediately confirm PICC tip position even bedside patient , thus , save cost time .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Peripherally inserted central catheter , PICC line , clinically use many year treatment patient , whereby implantation occur x-ray/fluoroscopy . Female male patient legal age medical indication Power-PICC-Line catheter implantation screen study . These medical indication include necessity chemotherapy course oncological treatment parenteral nutrition . The study objective test efficacy safety SHERLOCK system , evaluate monocentric , randomized-controlled study . The advantage participate patient lie reduce radiation exposure due discontinue final chest x-ray examination ( fluoroscopy ) . Furthermore , SHERLOCK system deploy directly ward , patient 's bedside lead cost time save . Recruited in- outpatient ( legal age ) indication Power-PICC-Line catheter implantation randomly assign one two arm ( fluoroscopy SHERLOCK ) . Depending randomization , Power-PICC implantation occur either fluoroscopy SHERLOCK system . All related substance , measure procedure perform accord clinical routine . The medical device fully integrate magnetic track ECG-based peripherally inserted central catheter ( PICC ) tip confirmation technology apply patient normal sinus rhythm place peripheral vein . The Sherlock system CE-certified since December 2011 . The referral patient indication PICC-Line implantation institute diagnostic interventional radiology occur different department University Hospital Jena . The patient register radiological treatment check radiologist PICC-Line implantation indicate . If case , radiologist conduct inform consent discussion patient possible complication risk intervention informs also possible study . After signature write informed consent , patient include . On intervention day , patient randomly assign one two study arm RandomTool ( Sherlock vs. fluoroscopy ) . According randomization group , PICC catheter implant ( duration : 30 minute ) eventually chest x-ray ( fluoroscopy ) perform assess safety efficacy.The intervention time puncture catheter placement document . After intervention , patient transfer back ward send home hemodynamically stable condition . The examination puncture site discharge perform ward physician family doctor . 24 h PICC-Line implantation , treat physician contact questioned possible complication ( catheter occlusion , haematoma , infection puncture site , arm vein thrombosis , pain , etc . ) , thoroughly document .</detailed_description>
