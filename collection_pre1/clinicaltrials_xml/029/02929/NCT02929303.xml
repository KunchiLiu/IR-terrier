	<brief_title>Expanded Access Omegaven IV Fat Emulsion Infants Children With PNALD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The etiology parenteral nutrition associate liver disease ( PNALD ) currently consider multifactorial . Available treatment option disease process limit achieve moderate success best . Unlike conventional intravenous fat emulsion , Omegaven™ comprise solely fish oil contain primarily omega-3 fatty acid . The investigator hypothesize administer Omegaven™ patient PNALD place conventional fat emulsion may reverse cholestasis allow patient maintain adequate PN able ingest adequate nutrition enterally .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Pediatric patient age 0 18 yr 2 . Patients PN dependent ( unable meet nutritional need solely enteral nutrition ) . It assume patient require parenteral nutrition least 30 day inclusion study . 3 . Patients must parenteral nutrition associate liver disease ( PNALD ) define direct bilirubin 2mg/dl . Other cause liver disease exclude . A liver biopsy necessary treatment . 4 . 2 consecutive direct bilirubin &gt; 2.0 mg/dl . one week apart . 5 . Signed patient inform consent . 6 . The patient must utilize standard therapy clinically appropriate prevent progression his/her liver disease . Such therapy could include surgical treatment , cyclic PN , avoid overfeeding , reduction/removal copper manganese PN , advancement enteral feeding , use ursodiol ( i.e. , Actigall ) . 1 . Documented cause chronic liver disease parenteral nutrition associate liver disease . 2 . An allergy seafood product , egg protein , and/or previous allergy Omegaven . 3 . Active coagulopathy characterize ongoing bleeding requirement clot factor replacement ( e.g . fresh frozen plasma cryoprecipitate ) maintain homeostasis . 4 . Impaired lipid metabolism severe hyperlipidemia without pancreatitis. ( e.g . ( triglyceride &gt; 1000mg/dl receive intralipid 1g/kg/day less ) 5 . Unstable diabetes mellitus hyperglycemia ( Blood glucose &gt; 200 mg/dL ) time initiation Omegaven 6 . Currently treat stroke , embolism , collapse shock , myocardial infarction . 7 . Cholestasis due reason parenteral associate liver disease 8 . Active new infection time initiation Omegaven 9 . Hemodynamic instability ( e.g . receive vasopressor ) time initiation Omegaven . 10 . The patient may enrol clinical trial involve investigational agent ( unless approve designated physician multidisciplinary team ) . 11 . Known pregnancy .</criteria>
