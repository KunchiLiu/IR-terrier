	<brief_summary>Intestinal microbiota recently emerge important player progression complication chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) . And drug therapy select gut target raise lot concern . It report composition intestinal flora change uremic patient . Specifically , imbalanced ecosystem high number pathogen Clostridia , Enterobacteria , low number beneficial microbe Lactobacilli Bifidobacteria . This modification intestinal flora strongly increase transformation amino acid Uremic Retention solutes , e.g. , indoxyl-sulfate ( IS ) , p-cresyl sulfate ( PCS ) , call gut-derived uremic toxin . The dysbiosis also contribute increase intestinal permeability disrupt colonic epithelial tight junction , may subsequently lead translocation endotoxin bacteria host 's internal environment , result systemic micro-inflammation.Also promote progression renal failure incidence cardiovascular complication , renal osteodystrophy anemia.Probiotics define World Health Organization 'live microorganism , administer adequate amount , confer health benefit host ' . Probiotics increasingly use various pathologic conditions.It say probiotic therapeutic role maintain metabolically balance gastrointestinal tract ( GIT ) .And previous study , investigator find uremic rat , lactobacillus acidophilus relieve bacterial translocation decrease level inflammatory markers.So study mainly design investigate whether probiotic modulate balance intestinal ecosystem , prevent bacterial translocation gut alleviate systemic inflammation hemodialysis ( HD ) patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study single-centre , double-blind , placebo-controlled , randomised trial . Participants undergo 2 week run-in period , follow randomisation either probiotic supplement placebo 6 month . The study population hemodialysis patient Dialysis Department First Affiliated Hospital Xi'an Jiaotong University . The Dialysis Department 400 patient regularly come receive dialysis therapy three time week.It 's relatively easy u follow collect data.Patients meet criterion able provide inform consent recruited.Then computer-generated randomisation participant treatment order undertaken external statistical consultant . This process allocation conceal randomisation order researcher participant . In addition , supplement pack off-site generic label . After randomization , baseline data collect participant undergo face-to-face dietary education dietitian , incorporate standard hemodialysis education first week run-in.In week following , throughout intervention , patient encourage maintain stable protein fibre intake , specific attention maintaining source nutrients.Participants ' dietary intake study assess every month use semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire . And trial start , questionnaire biological sample perform collected corresponding time . All serious adverse event report ethic committee , whether deem intervention relate . Adherence supplement measure pill count every two week . Sample size calculate use plasma concentration bacterial genomic DNA main variable assume power 95 % error 5 % . Considering plasma bacterial genomic DNA concentration 45.13±24.54 ng/ul end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) patient accord previous study 20 % drop , investigator estimate 1:1 randomisation , least 36 patient group enrol detect 50 % decrease plasma concentration bacterial genomic DNA . Data report mean±SD normally distribute median ( 25-75 % percentile ) . The Shapiro-Wilk test perform ass whether data normally distribute . Statistical comparison normally distribute data perform use Student 's t-test . Mann-Whitney U-test use compare rank variable measure gastrointestinal symptom probiotic placebo group . The threshold statistical significance p value &lt; 0.05 . And external statistical consultant Clinical Research Center involve data validation analysis activity .</detailed_description>
