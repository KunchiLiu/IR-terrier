Secondly , RCT often require strict inclusion exclusion criterion , result inadequate representation study , thus limit conclusion spread overall . There challenge different treatment method actual effect patient evaluation conventional medical practice RCT . Real World Research base clinical practice pay close attention highly response problem , registry study apply widely clinical practice . With comparative effectiveness research method hospital registration study approach , base class medication recommend 2014 GOLD Chinese Treatment Guidelines COPD , purpose study objectively record method , efficacy influence factor COPD commonly use treatment methods/programs ( Western medicine , Traditional Chinese Medicine Integrative Medicine ) actual medical environment , analysis application characteristic different program , provide basis revision promotion . This first registration study COPD China .</detailed_description>
