	<brief_title>Percutaneous Nephrostomy Versus Stent In Sepsis Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The obstructed kidney set urosepsis urological emergency . Stone manipulation set active , untreated infection concomitant urinary tract obstruction lead life-threatening sepsis . Therefore , urgent decompression collect system warrant . There two option urgent decompression obstruct collect system : 1 . Image-guided percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement 2 . Cystoscopic retrograde placement ureteric stent This strategy allow drainage infected urine penetration antibiotic affect renal unit . Definitive stone manipulation delay infection clear follow appropriate course antimicrobial therapy . Both European Association Urology ( EAU ) American Urological Association ( AUA ) provide guideline management obstruct kidney . Both organisation provide evidence-based statement high recommendation urgent decompression kidney mandate set sepsis . However , neither organisation recommend one decompression modality . There lack high quality up-to-date evidence support consensus view one method decompression superior . This study aim determine effective method renal decompression case obstruction sepsis associate ureteric calculus .</detailed_description>
