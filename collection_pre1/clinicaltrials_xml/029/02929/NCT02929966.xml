	<detailed_description>Advanced fibrosing interstitial lung disease ( ILD ) group often progressive incurable condition . The common form ILD , idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( IPF ) , associate poor survival , high symptom burden poor quality life disease progress . ILD represent increase proportion patient chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure . Despite poor prognosis , palliative care remain underused patient ILD . This may due under-recognition palliative care need symptom burden , unfamiliarity discomfort palliative therapy . Though oncology largely embrace early integration palliative care , translated improvement end-of-life ( EOL ) care patient lung cancer , palliative EOL care non-malignant disease gain increased attention . In pulmonary disease , research mainly focus COPD demonstrate significant burden unmet palliative care need low quality EOL care compare patient cancer . Similar attention beginning pay ILD , symptom burden quality EOL care patient ILD yet quantify , furthermore none far investigate possible role palliative care patient . The investigator examine present study effect introduce palliative patient end-stage idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis , refractory pharmacological treatment deem treated , patient-reported outcome end-of-life care . The investigator randomly assign patient receive either early palliative care integrate standard respiratory care standard respiratory care alone . Quality life symptom assess baseline 12 week The primary outcome change quality life symptom 12 month .</detailed_description>
