	<brief_title>Pediatric Intensive Care Ulcer Prophylaxis Pilot Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite sparse pediatric data effectiveness stress ulcer prophylaxis prevent gastrointestinal ( GI ) bleeding , 60 % critically ill child receive medication . This may unintended consequence - increase risk nosocomial infection - may serious common bleeding drug prescribe prevent . A large randomize trial ( RCT ) need assess balance risk benefit , determine strategy withhold stress ulcer prophylaxis critically ill child inferior strategy routine stress ulcer prophylaxis . RCTs pediatric critical care exceptionally challenge complete ; thus , rigorous pilot RCT crucial . The pilot may prevent pursuit trial ultimately feasible - ethically financially responsible . It likely carefully design pilot trial ensure large trial undertake successful .</detailed_description>
