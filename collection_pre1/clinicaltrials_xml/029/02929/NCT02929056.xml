	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate compare heal characteristic , reduction size wound measure complete healing wound follow application biologic product dress instead alginate dress along standard debridement compression therapy versus standard care treatment VLUs . The biologic product use study call AmnioExCel™ .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Amniotic Membrane Allograft Application Management Venous Leg Ulcerations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 40 participant enrol study Greenville Health System . Participation anticipate last 17 week include 4 week screening period , randomization ( Visit 1 ) office visit study doctor 's office every week 12 week ( Visit 2 - Visit 12 ) . All participant receive standard care wind treatment 4 week screening period . The treatment plan outline treatment group 1 treatment group 2 follow randomization . Participants randomly assign ( like flip coin ) one two treatment group . There equal chance enrol either two treatment group . Neither participant study doctor control group assignment . Treatment Group 1 : participant receive standard care treatment include use multi-layer compression wrap VLU . Treatment Group 2 : participant receive application biologic product AmnioExCel™ dress instead application alginate dress addition standard debridement use multi-layer compression wrap VLU . If participant one VLU , one enrol study receive application AmnioExCel™ dressing . The remain VLUs receive application alginate dressing . AmnioExCel™ human cellular tissue base product register United States Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . It intend use wound cover make dehydrated human amniotic membrane ( innermost layer placenta ) obtain donate human placenta . The use AmnioExCel™ specifically study consider standard care .</detailed_description>
