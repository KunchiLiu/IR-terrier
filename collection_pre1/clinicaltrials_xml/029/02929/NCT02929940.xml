	<brief_summary>Alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency ( AATD ) third common genetic disorder lead death worldwide . Apart lung disease , AATD also lead liver involvement 50 % patient . Hence , liver involvement second common cause morbidity mortality AATD patient . But natural history disease adult well understood specific therapy still phase preclinical study . Despite fact therapeutic preventative potential , AATD-related liver disease still largely neglected patient healthcare professional . To improve hepatologic care patient AATD , investigator initiate prospective multi-center study Europe systematically evaluate liver function patient relatives . The investigator cooperate patient organization well lung center specialize AATD-related lung disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Liver Disease Patients With alpha1-antitrypsin Deficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency ( AAT deficiency ) frequently overlook metabolic disorder . Apart lung disease , AAT deficiency also lead liver disease . This affect people age ethnic group . Although involvement liver second common cause decrease quality life life expectancy Alpha1 patient , preventative care plan , like one implement avoid lung involvement , yet draw . Chronic liver involvement therefore often remain undetected late stage diagnose case AAT deficiency . This compounded fact patient affect generally unspecific symptom . Moreover , routine diagnostic measurement ( e.g . liver function test ) often reveal abnormality . In case late diagnosis , diverse complication liver disease longer effectively prevent . Liver involvement AAT deficiency lead liver cirrhosis liver cancer . Liver cirrhosis life-threatening consequence many liver disorder carry poor prognosis . Besides AAT deficiency , many - potentially treatable - condition , viral hepatitis , excessive alcohol consumption diabetes , cause liver damage . Liver cirrhosis lead many , often life-threatening secondary disorder heavy bleed liver cancer . It therefore crucial liver disorder AAT deficiency diagnose early stage , prevent complication treat concomitant risk factor . The investigator collaborate various patient support group hospital specialise AAT deficiency-associated lung disease . Together collaborator , investigator hope improve care affected patient help bring therapeutic advance . The aim study clarify liver function modify patient AAT deficiency . For , among thing , investigator use : ( ) modern ultrasound-based scanner non-invasive measurement degree liver scarring . ( ii ) Specialized liver parameter blood sample , also provide information exist liver disorder ( iii ) Questionnaire . Study participant receive full , cost-free analysis individual liver involvement give appropriate recommendation disease prevention . The examination provide relief many everybody , investigator able offer individual liver damage prevention plan . All adult patient ( every genotype ) well family member interested study advised . Besides specialist clinic Aachen ( Germany ) , free examination throughout even outside Germany offer .</detailed_description>
