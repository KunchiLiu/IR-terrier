	<brief_summary>The investigator propose Delivery Optimization Antiretroviral Therapy Study - The DO ART Study - prospective randomize study strategy optimize community-based ART initiation , monitor resupply among HIV-positive person South Africa Uganda . The investigator work closely community member , stakeholder , local provider , local Department Health ( DoH ) integrate community-based ART delivery HIV clinic , pharmacy labs . Following community sensitization , participant recruit community-based HTC HIV clinic . HIV-positive person engage care receive point-of-care CD4 test determine ART eligibility . HIV-positive person eligible ART national guideline randomize one three ART delivery arm : ( ) Home ART initiation mobile van ART monitoring resupply , ( ii ) Hybrid model clinic ART initiation mobile van ART monitoring resupply , ( iii ) Clinic ART initiation , monitor resupply - current standard care ( SOC )</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Delivery Optimization Antiretroviral Therapy ( The DO ART Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) tremendous potential prevent HIV-associated morbidity , mortality transmission . With reliable ART supply monitoring , life expectancy HIV-positive person southern Africa comparable HIV-negative person . However , HIV-associated mortality continue high among HIV-positive person diagnose engage care . Of 35 million person worldwide meet WHO ( World Health Organization ) guideline ART , 15 million ART . For already burden health care system face double person ART , effective efficient ART initiation monitoring strategy need . First line ART regimens daily oral regimen well-tolerated , increase simplicity ART delivery general , include community-based ART delivery feasible alternative clinic-based delivery . A priority optimization ART delivery directly compare evaluate impact cost community-based ART initiation resupply clinic delivery ART high prevalence setting Africa , order expand capacity provide ART coverage . The investigator extensive experience community-based strategy HIV test linkage care . In series study , investigator demonstrate community-based HIV test counseling ( HTC ) result &gt; 90 % knowledge serostatus similarly high linkage rate HIV-positive person HIV care . However , investigator observe bottleneck within HIV clinic result delay ART initiation , particularly high CD4 count ; 59 % HIV-positive ART eligible person virally suppress 12 month , far UNAIDS target 80 % . Those finding suggest community-based strategy ART initiation maintenance could address clinic inefficiency patient opportunity cost barrier optimize ART delivery . South Africa Uganda plan provide decentralize service , include community health worker , CHWs , ( know community health extension worker , CHEWs , Uganda ) conduct HTC linkage care local pharmacy pick-up location medication , meet challenge scale ART . The investigator propose Delivery Optimization Antiretroviral Therapy ( The DO ART Study ) . A rigorous evaluation innovative , decentralize ART optimization strategy safely cost-effectively deliver ART monitor viral suppression among HIV-positive person South Africa Uganda . Using prospective individually-randomized design , investigator compare home ART initiation local mobile van ART resupply clinic center care among HIV-positive person South Africa Uganda . Following community sensitization , participant recruit community-based HTC HIV clinic . HIV-positive person eligible ART national guideline randomize one three ART delivery arm : ( ) Home ART initiation mobile van ART monitoring resupply , ( ii ) A hybrid model clinic ART initiation mobile van ART monitoring resupply , ( iii ) Clinic ART initiation , monitor resupply - standard care ( SOC ) . The co-primary outcome 1 ) proportion HIV-positive person initiate ART achieve viral suppression 2 ) cost per HIV-positive person suppress HIV viral load 12 month . The secondary outcome safety , social harm , acceptability , cost-effectiveness community-based ART delivery , understand qualitatively driver engagement care . The investigator hypothesize community-based ART initiation acceptable , efficient improve outcome , specifically prompter ART initiation high proportion HIV-positive person achieve viral suppression , compare standard clinic ART delivery model . Decentralizing HIV care asymptomatic individual expand overall capacity health system provide care HIV-positive person use exist clinical infrastructure .</detailed_description>
