	<detailed_description>The study repeated-measures cross-over pilot RCT examine feasibility trial protocol study effectiveness immersive VR minimize procedural pain distress child cancer . The research objective : ( 1 ) pilot implement immersive virtual reality ( VR ) effectiveness test future RCT ( measure implementation outcome ) ; ( 2 ) determine treatment effect size ( measure preliminary effectiveness outcome ) , VR , program distract child SCP needle insertion , active control intervention ( i.e. , watch video headphone ) ; ( 3 ) ass impact child parent factor potentially associate VR treatment effectiveness . Both intervention control group receive standard medical care ( e.g. , topical anesthetic ) . A convenience sample 40 child adolescent cancer ( 20 participant per treatment arm ; 10 boys 10 girl per treatment arm ) recruit . In addition , child act control . A washout period 1 month use control carry-over effect condition . In addition usual care , child experimental condition wear VR headset plus headphone . In control condition , child watch video ( i.e. , age-appropriate video select oncology-affiliated child life specialist ) iPad , wear headphone experimental condition . Implementation outcomes include accrual retention rate , acceptability technical difficulty . Effectiveness outcomes include child pain , distress , fear , well parent distress .</detailed_description>
