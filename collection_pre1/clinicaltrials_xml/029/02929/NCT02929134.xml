	<brief_summary>Current lymphedema management protocol base use simple measure hygiene ( regular wash soap water , skin nail care ) , use topical antibiotic antifungal agent , exercise footwear . This consider `` standard care '' endemic country absence structure treatment program . Previous control clinical trial extensive field experience show benefit measure reduce frequency attack acute dermato-lymphangio-adenitis ( ADLA ) drive progression lymphedema . In present study , progression lymphedema group patient receive six-week course doxycycline compare group receive doxycycline `` look-alike '' placebo tablet . However , group enrol standardize `` regimen hygiene '' describe . Thus , patient enrol `` placebo '' group also receive current standard care , placebo use study help identify benefit doxycycline background simple hygiene measure . The regimen explain participant train use establish standardize method hygiene effectively apply prior initiation drug treatment . In addition , patient evaluate 3 , 6 , 12 24 months.. A common , generic SOP handout describe method train schedule use similar method employ across site .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A 24 Month Study Compare Efficacy Doxycycline v Placebo Improving Filarial Lymphedema Sri Lanka</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This ( LEDOXY ) trial design randomize , control , observer- , provider- patient-blinded multicenter superiority trial two parallel group primary endpoint change grade lymphedema 24 month . The population stratify accord Grade ( Early Grade 1-3 ; Late Grade 4-6 ) . Randomization perform block randomization within center block ( N=4-10 ) group ( Early Late ) . The effect 6-week course doxycycline lymphedema without active filarial infection demonstrate single setting Africa ( Ghana ) . In order expand benefit observation , similar study need carry endemic setting . Lymphatic filariasis endemic many country Africa Asia yet implement morbidity management programme . In addition , component propose hygiene package likely vary depend availability material human resource . The conduct trial multi-center study allow evaluation efficacy drug variety setting also facilitate rapid adoption respective control program endemic country , proven useful . The choice study sit endemic country make base availability ) adequate number patient various grade lymphedema b ) clinical trial team familiar lymphedema management procedure past experience similar trial . All screen patient enrol programme hygiene ( describe ) require demonstrate ability use establish standardized method hygiene effectively apply prior initiation drug treatment . Eligible patient randomize receive either daily doxycycline placebo . Doxycycline placebo provide Medopharm ( India ) . Re-labeling packaging drug placebo do Piramal Healthcare , Morpeth , UK Additionally , un-blinding data analysis , placebo group offer doxycycline treatment intervention prove effective ameliorate LE . Both doxycycline placebo administer supervision ( directly observe treatment ) 6 week . The first dose doxycycline ( two 100 mg tablet 50kg body weight one 100 mg tablet 40 50 kg body weight ) placebo give investigation complete informed consent obtain patient initiate programme basic hygiene . Patients encourage eat swallow tablet whole glass water . Vomited dos replace . Ideally , patient require come every day close community health center take drug supervision . Subjects living village distance health center treat community health care provider local caregiver living village inform trained possible adverse event related drug . Since study site may village base without health centre , patient may treat village require attend daily fix meeting point . The trial clinician research team help train community health worker normally administer treatment . Patients come clinic every week patient collect drug one week . The provider keep diary mark time intake drug . A health worker may make surprise check patient 's residence look diary also count remain drug estimate compliance .</detailed_description>
