	<brief_summary>FORCE project aim measure actives force malignant tumor magnetic resonance force ( FRM ) . Two main force consider key indicator therapeutic response metastatic potential : interstitial force traction force interface cell/tumor . Biomarkers force developped use direct image magnetic resonance force ( FRM ) . Efficiency non-invasive biomarkers evaluate capacity predict tumoral environment invasion , notably micro-vascular invasion , therapeutical result Hepatocellular Cancer ( HCC ) . Principal criteria 1. micro-vascular invasion assess pathological examination surgical piece ( gold standard ) . 2. interstitial force traction force cell/tumor interface assess FRM . Population patient divide three group . A first group constitute 20 volunteer patient come abdominal MRI know hepatic disease , order determine feasibility FRM . A second group constitute 60 patient resectable HCC eligible surgery . This group enable evaluate tumoral environment invasion . Third group constitute 50 patient HCC eligible transplant transcatheter arterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) treatment pending treatment transplant . This group enable evaluate efficiency TACE necrosis percentage treat HCC . Inclusion patient occur 24 month total study duration 36 month . All patient MRI usual care . FRM perform MRI use specific medical device therefore correspond additional procedure research . Moreover , patient group 2 3 ask participate ancillary study consist circulate tumoral cell ( CTC ) measurement . If accept , blood sample collect MRI order evaluate correlation CTC micro-vascular invasion .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>FORCE project aim measure actives force malignant tumor FRM . Two main force consider key indicator therapeutic response metastatic potential : interstitial force traction force cell/tumor interface . Biomarkers force developped use direct image magnetic resonance force ( FRM ) .

Principal criteria 1. micro-vascular invasion assess pathological examination surgical piece ( gold standard ) . 2. interstitial force traction force cell/tumor interface assess FRM . Secondary criterion : 1 . Percentage nodular necrosis HCC marker therapeutic response assess pathological examination explant liver ( gold standard ) . 2. interstitial force traction force cell/tumor interface assess FRM . Population patient divide three group ( see ) . Inclusion patient occur 24 month total study duration 36 month . Moreover , patient group 2 3 ask participate ancillary study consist circulate tumoral cell ( CTC ) measurement . If accept , blood sample collect MRI order evaluate correlation CTC micro-vascular invasion . - Group 1 constitute 20 volunteer patient come abdominal MRI know hepatic disease , order determine feasibility FRM . - Group 2 constitute 60 patient resectable HCC eligible surgery . This group enable evaluate tumoral environment invasion . Patients group select multidisciplinary medical meeting . If accept participate ancillary study , blood sample collect ( 2 tube 6 mL 10 mL respectively ) MRI , exam always perform hepatic resection 5-minute- additional sequence measure FRM . As soon surgery perform , surgery piece analyse anatomopathology laboratory order ass , notably , presence mirco-vascular invasion . - Group 3 constitute 50 patient HCC eligible transplant transcatheter arterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) treatment pending treatment transplant . This group enable evaluate efficiency TACE necrosis percentage treat HCC . Patients group select multidisciplinary medical meeting . If TACE already perform inclusion patient accepts participate ancillary study , blood sample collect ( 2 tube 6 mL 10 mL respectively ) MRI , exam always perform hepatic transplant 5-minute- additional sequence measure FRM . As soon transplant perform , surgery piece ( whole patient liver ) analyse anatomopathology laboratory order ass , notably , presence necrosis HCC nodules previously treat TACE . If TACE perform inclusion , TACE planified usually . Data TACE collect case report form ( CRF ) . After TACE , exams perform described . All patient MRI usual care . FRM perform MRI use specific medical device therefore correspond additional procedure research .</detailed_description>
