	<detailed_description>Pedestrian injury pose significant risk healthy old adult patient Parkinson 's disease . Several age-related change , include slow visual processing speed , increase risky pedestrian behavior . Persons Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) even high risk pedestrian injury due motor non-motor symptom . Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterize motor symptom include slowness , tremor , stiffness , balance problem . Visual processing speed abnormality , anxiety , cognitive problem common non-motor symptom . The Useful Field View ( UFOV® ) test measure visual processing speed . The UFOV® test perform touch-screen computer display object central peripheral visual field brief duration . Successful performance test require integration visual sensory information higher-order cognitive processing . Our research show UFOV® test performance correlate pedestrian behavior PD patient . Speed Processing Training ( SOPT ) computer-based training use visual exercise improve cognitive processing . The training involve identify localize visual information quickly increasingly demand visual display . SOPT demonstrate improve performance UFOV test healthy old adult PD patient . It hypothesize SOPT train improve pedestrian safety healthy old adult PD patient . In proposed study , use within-subject , randomize , control , cross-over design evaluate computer train program ( Speed Processing Training - SOPT ) improve safe pedestrian behavior patient Parkinson 's disease healthy old adult virtual reality pedestrian environment effect train persist long-term .</detailed_description>
