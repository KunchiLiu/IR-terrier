	<brief_summary>This prospective , randomize , double-blinded , placebo-controlled trial compare oxycodone/acetaminophen prescribe without ibuprofen pain control follow open unilateral inguinal hernia repair , allow exception currently prescribe opioid ( codeine , hydrocodone , hydromorphone , morphine , methadone , oxymorphone , transdermal fentanyl ) , continue . The patient allow continue over-the-counter pain medication , ibuprofen , naproxen , acetaminophen contain medication , prescribe investigator study . Patients receive Ibuprofen give placebo pill compose corn starch . The placebo pill formulate shape , size color ibuprofen capsule . Neither investigator research subject know subject receive placebo versus Ibuprofen . The subject complete pain level medication diary , follow 2 month surgery . The research aim discover appropriate amount opioid medication prescribe patient undergo elective open inguinal hernia repair , reduce total opioid dose need utilizing ibuprofen combination . The investigator expect subject take ibuprofen use less oxycodone/acetaminophen , comparable low mean pain level . This could contribute reduce surplus opioids prescribe physician surgery , lead opioid use disorder . This particular procedure common men , finding potential decrease symptom pain Active Duty member DoD beneficiary undergo inguinal hernia repair , risk prescription drug abuse dependence .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Screening Visit : Discuss purpose study require completion study-related questionnaire potential impact active duty member . ( research-driven ) Obtain sign Informed Consent Document HIPAA Authorization ( research-driven ) . Review patient 's past medical history Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technology Application ( AHLTA ) ESSENTRIS verify inclusion/exclusion criterion . ( research-driven ) The investigator record subject 's tobacco use history , alcohol use history , marijuana use history , illicit drug use history , previous non-prescription use opioids . ( standard care ) Obtain overall pain score , 0 100 , 100 bad pain imaginable . ( research-driven ) Obtain localize pain score 0 100 , 100 bad pain imaginable , patient attribute specifically hernia schedule surgical intervention . ( research-driven ) Instruct patient discontinue use over-the-counter pain medication , ibuprofen , naproxen , acetaminophen contain medication , prescribe investigator study . Subjects follow blood test drawn , include ( research-driven ) : Fasting comprehensive metabolic panel ( liver function , renal function , plasma glucose test ) via 1 venipuncture ( 5-10 milliliter , approximately 1-2 teaspoon blood drawn ) Subject 's CMP result must within 30 day day surgery need repeat . Women childbearing potential serum pregnancy test ( 5-10 milliliter , approximately 1-2 teaspoon blood ) urine pregnancy test ( 10 drop less 1 milliliter urine ) ( research-driven ) . Visit 1 ( may occur day screen visit day visit 2 ) : The standard care local anesthesia use type surgery bupivacaine . The surgeon remind via note medical record . ( standard care ) Subjects randomize MOFMC Pharmacy one two naturally stratify group ( e.g. , opioid naive patient non-opioid naive patient ) , randomization opioid + ibuprofen study group opioid + placebo study group The MOFMC Pharmacy staff maintain key use un-blind randomization scheme need emergent patient care issue . Study ID number use maintain blinding confidentiality . ( research-driven ) Opioid naive patient ( use opioid less 14 day past 6 month , history opioid use disorder time ) randomize one two group : Group A : Subjects prescribe ibuprofen 800 milligram mouth every 8 hour need pain 5 day , 1 2 tablet oxycodone/acetaminophen 5 milligrams/325 milligram ( Qty . 30 ) mouth every 4 hour need pain 5 day . Group B : Subjects prescribe 800 milligram placebo pill ( contain corn starch ) take mouth every 8 hour need pain 1 2 tablet oxycodone/acetaminophen 5 milligram 325 milligram ( Qty . 30 ) mouth every 4 hour need pain 5 day . Non-Opioid naive patient ( opioid use 14 day past 6 month , history opioid use disorder ) randomize one two group : Group C : Subjects prescribe ibuprofen 800 milligram mouth every 8 hour need pain 5 day , addition prefer opioid medication prescription . Group D : Subjects prescribe advised continue take prefer current oral opioid prescription ( codeine , hydrocodone , hydromorphone , morphine , methadone , oxymorphone , transdermal fentanyl ) .
