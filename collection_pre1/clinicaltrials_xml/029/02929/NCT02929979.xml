	<brief_summary>The project examine whether computerized neuroscience-based cognitive training program improve cognitive functioning recovery outcomes among Veterans Alcohol Use Disorder co-occurring PTSD . Information study help determine malleability cognitive dysfunction , establish risk factor poor recovery outcomes population . Improved functional outcome decrease risk chronic impairment ultimately help affected individual live rich , productive life . Web-based treatment technology may increase reach impact treatment , foster patient recovery case staff , space , acceptability counseling , transportation barrier . Findings may also support expand use exist , highly-accessible cognitive remediation technology vulnerable clinical population .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The prevalence Alcohol Use Disorder ( AUD ) , Posttraumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) co-occurring AUD PTSD elevate among Veterans compare civilian ( Carter et al. , 2011 ) . Despite available empirically support treatment , relapse non-response rate remain high individual co-occurring AUD PTSD evidence particularly poor clinical functional outcome ( McCarthy &amp; Petrakis , 2010 ) . Given recent estimate 63-76 % Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom ( OEF/OIF ) Veterans AUD also diagnosis PTSD ( Seal et al. , 2011 ) , urgent need reduce chronic impairment among grow highly vulnerable population . AUD PTSD characterize separate overlap deficit attention , memory higher-order skill know executive function ( e.g. , planning , inhibition , self-regulation ) , turn , associate poor clinical functional outcome ( Bates et al. , 2013 ; Polak et al. , 2012 , Aupperle , 2012 ) . Indeed , cognitive dysfunction interfere many aspect recovery ( e.g . gain control maladaptive , over-trained behavior ) target trans-disease process direct intervention represent potentially high-yield innovative approach optimize recovery outcomes . Neuroscience-based computerized cognitive training program psychiatric illness achieve grow support literature demonstrate strong potential remediate disrupt cognitive process observe AUD co-occurring PTSD ( Bates et . 2013 ; Vinogradov et al. , 2012 ) . These program offer highly accessible , individualized , patient-driven , non-medication treatment approach improve cognitive functioning . Such improvement may increase emotional behavioral control enhance patient ' capacity effectively employ adaptive self-management strategy . To date however , study capitalize available evidence-based cognitive remediation technology comprehensively target pattern neurocognitive dysfunction underlie AUD PTSD . The propose Rehabilitation Research Development ( RR &amp; D ) Career Development Award-2 ( CDA-2 ) seek fill gap conduct randomize prospective study , design evaluate feasibility efficacy exist web-based cognitive training program ( BrainHQ ; Posit Science/Brain Plasticity Institute ) versus placebo , improve cognitive functioning recovery outcomes . The research conduct iteratively , two stage , base Stage Model Behavioral Therapy Development per National Institute Drug Abuse , two overarch aim : Aim 1 : Examine acceptability , usability feasibility exist web-based cognitive training program tailor AUD co-occurring PTSD . Aim 2 : Test efficacy web-based cognitive training program improve cognitive function well clinical functional outcome . To test aim , 148 Veterans AUD PTSD recruit outpatient Substance Use Disorder ( SUD ) treatment program . Participants randomize either cognitive training computer game control . Individuals complete baseline assessment , follow 30 hour home-based cognitive training computer game 6 week . Assessments complete week training , well post-training post-training follow-up . The primary outcome performance ( untrained ) neuropsychological assessment battery 6 month post-training . Secondary outcome include alcohol use , PTSD symptoms quality life . Findings propose study inform clinical practice policy investigate whether cognitive training program ( show improve cognitive function clinical population ) improve cognitive functioning promote gain functional recovery AUD PTSD . This study lay groundwork investigate potential cognitive training remediate neurocognitive disruption dually diagnose SUD patient population across different VA treatment program . This translational program research help vulnerable Veteran population achieve optimal endure recovery outcome .</detailed_description>
