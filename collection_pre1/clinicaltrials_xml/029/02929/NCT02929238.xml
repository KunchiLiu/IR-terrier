	<brief_summary>You ask participate study complex wound require treatment negative pressure wound therapy ( NPWT ) . NPWT therapeutic technique involve placement wound vacuum site wound . The wound vacuum delivers negative pressure wound site dress . Any fluid collect process collect foam ( sponge ) underneath dress . This therapy help draw edge wound together , remove infectious material , help promote healthy tissue growth speed wound heal . The purpose study determine place polypropylene suture ( material normally use close wound ) wind NPWT foam would decrease pain upon removal sponge allow adequate healing wound .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Wound Vac Polypropylene Suture Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>If decide participate study ask sign inform consent form prior begin study activity . If agree participate study procedure follow : - The participant enrol study receive NPWT combination polypropylene suture lay half wound . Enrollment study consider standard care . - You randomize ( like flip coin ) side wound suture place . Randomization mean study team say side suture go . Your information put computer computer pick side place suture . The polypropylene suture place half wound . There equal chance polypropylene suture place right left side . The half wind polypropylene suture place act control ( comparison ) group study . The use study polypropylene suture consider standard care . - The wound vacuum place entire wound leave place 3 day per standard care . - After 3 day time heal process , nurse remove wound vacuum , dressing , suture , sponge . - One blind study physician come look wound . This study physicians determine NPWT , without study polypropylene suture , need . - You ask verbally rate pain use numerical rating scale ( 0 - 10 ) relation side wind wound vacuum remove . - If NPWT need without use study polypropylene suture , withdrawn study - If discharge NPWT continue receive polypropylene suture placement would end study participation - If NPWT need use negative pressure wound therapy , polypropylene suture sponge place process continue note wound heal withdrawn study . - Information medical record collect throughout study . You also ask question medical surgical history well medication currently take . - Your demographic collect include age , date birth , race , sex , height , weight , ethnicity .</detailed_description>
