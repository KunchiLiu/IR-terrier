	<brief_title>Study LYC-55716 Adult Subjects With Locally Advanced Metastatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 30 subject across approximately 5 United States ( US ) sit enrolled Phase 1 portion study approximately 60 subject across approximately 15 US site enrol Phase 2a portion study . The Phase 1 portion study follow 3 + 3 dose-escalation design evaluate twice-daily ( BID ) administration LYC-55716 DLTs determine MTD RP2D assessment Phase 2A . A treatment cycle consist 28 day treatment subject may continue receive subsequent cycle therapy long clinically significant progressive disease . In Phase 2A portion study , 60 subject locally advance metastatic solid tumor consider likely responsive RORγ agonist enrol treated MTD RP2D . Primary Study Objectives Phase 1 - Evaluate safety tolerability LYC-55716 - Determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) recommend Phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) Phase 2a - Determine objective response rate accord response evaluation criterion solid tumor ( RECIST ) v1.1 . Secondary Study Objectives Phase 1 - Evaluate activity LYC-55716 objective response accord RECIST v1.1 . - Determine durability observe objective response Phase 2a - Determine duration response - Determine progression-free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS )</detailed_description>
