	<brief_title>Can Person-centred-care Intervention Improve Health-related Quality Life Patients With Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : The incidence head neck cancer ( HNC ) increase slightly . HNC treatment may affect general domain health-related quality life ( HRQoL ) provoke variety adverse symptom side effect , treatment . The objective study compare person-centred care intervention term HRQoL , disease-specific symptom problem , traditional care control group patient HNC . Methods : The intervention control group comprise 54 42 patient , respectively . Outcome measure use : EORTC QLQ-C30 EORTC QLQ-C35 . Both group answer questionnaire baseline 4 , 10 , 18 52 week start treatment . The questionnaire ' score compare group use independent sample test ( Student 's t-test ) non-parametric test ( Mann-Whitney U Test ) continuous variable . For categorical data , Fisher 's exact test use . Longitudinal data analyse use repeat measure covariance pattern model . Results : At baseline , intervention control group comparable term medical sociodemographic variable , clinical characteristic , HRQoL disease-specific symptom problem . At follow-up point , even bad period patient , person-centred-care group consistently report high score control group . The difference numerically always statistically significant . When use repeat measure covariance pattern model , statistically significant result find HNC-specific problem , swallow ( p= 0.014 ) , social eating ( p=0.048 ) feeling ill ( p=0.021 ) .</detailed_description>
