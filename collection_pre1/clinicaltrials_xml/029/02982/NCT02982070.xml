	<brief_title>TU Tough : Mental Toughness Training College Success</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Part 1 consist online survey , send email . This email sent TU ( University Tulsa ) Student Affairs office incoming freshman student also send study personnel student indicate interest study recruitment effort ( i.e. , flyer campus ) . This survey also allow student indicate whether would interested involved future research regard mental toughness strategy college success . The second aim accomplish via Part 2 study . Part 2 longitudinal portion assess student ' well-being ( i.e. , happiness , distress , anxiety , satisfaction , etc . ) academic success ( i.e. , retention TU , GPA , etc . ) completion either mental toughness train `` college usual '' . These participant select group participant complete Part 1 and/or via ongoing course within college university ( see recruitment section ) . Part 2 enroll maximum 300 participants/year first 3 year , ask remain study 5 year . These participant contact via phone , text message , email determine whether interested meet criterion . Those meet criterion schedule in-person session TU ( Part 2 ) complete write informed consent , provide saliva sample , obtain instruction regard completion survey session train protocol . Those enroll study ask complete survey session repeatedly next 5 year : ( 1 ) During first semester , Part 2 participant ask complete three survey session , one pre- one post- training phase , one final week . ( 2 ) During Spring semester first year , participant would complete three survey ( within first two week ; mid semester ; final week ) , follow one survey mid-Summer . ( 3 ) For Years 2-5 , survey session would occur per semester ( Fall , Spring , Summer ) , allow examination training may impact longer-term trajectory academic success psychological well-being . Each online survey assess psychological well-being , demographic medical history , academic activity . For provide consent u access limited information academic record ( specify consent research protocol section document ) , information combine collect survey data . For Part 3 , data collect subset participant two neuroimaging session LIBR ( Laureate Institute Brain Research ) . The first neuroimaging session complete within one month begin train phase ( mental toughness `` college usual '' ) second complete within one month end training phase . Each neuroimaging session last approximately 3-4 hour involve completion self-report measure regard current affective state , behavioral measure exploratory behavior , functional MRI session participant complete task related process emotional face , emotional image , reward . The fourth aim also accomplish via Part 2 study , involve collection DNA saliva collection first semester first year . Samples collect in-person first baseline session , write informed consent obtain . This data use assess genetic marker resiliency exist college population determine genetic marker interact impact mental toughness training ( i.e. , individual specific genetic marker well bad training ) .</detailed_description>
