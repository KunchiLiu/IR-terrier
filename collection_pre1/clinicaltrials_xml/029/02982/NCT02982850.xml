	<detailed_description>Amongst different type cardiac arrhythmia , tachyarrhythmia show high prevalence . The prevalence AF , tachyarrhythmia , approximately 2 % entire population 5 % population age 60 older . AF cause approximately 20 % event ischemic stroke , patient AF know 6 10 % risk ischemic stroke per year . In addition , AF result heart failure double mortality . With increase elderly population , worldwide trend increase hospitalization rate medical cost cause cardiac arrhythmia . In addition , whereas AF know occur mainly elderly , incidence AF also increase young population , think associate increased prevalence heart diseases , dietary change , increase environmental pollution . A . Previous study relate atrial fibrillation stroke . While AF characterize single electrophysiological abnormality , depend case , risk stroke varies 1 % /year 20 % /year . ii . New oral anticoagulant ( NOAC ) , leave atrial appendage occlusion , etc . study treatment replace warfarin aspirin effect also demonstrate . B . Relevant study trend limitation . Patients valvular AF known high incidence stroke patient nonvalvular AF . However , relevant data insufficient large randomized study compare NOAC treatment warfarin , conventional treatment , include many patient moderate severe valvular AF . ii . The exclusion valvular AF study base assumption pathogenesis thromboembolism would vary accord type AF . However , difference pathogenesis thromboembolism valvular AF nonvalvular AF remain unknown . C. Study feature i. Ischemic stroke divide symptomatic stroke brain lesion brain magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) silent cerebral infarct lesion brain MRI without stroke symptom . ii . According brain MRI follow-up study , incidence silent cerebral infarct 17.7 % ( 254 subject ) period 5 year , 11.4 % 254 subject report experienced symptom . This mean incidence silent cerebral infarct approximately 9 time symptomatic stroke . iii . In addition , patient history silent cerebral infarct know approximately twice likely experience stroke future without history silent . iv . Brain microbleed easily detect brain MRI well-known independent predictor intraparenchymal hemorrhage silent cerebral infarct . v. The prevention stroke study drug indirectly assess base incidence silent cerebral infarct brain microbleed brain MRI start study 1 year follow-up . D. Significance study . The incidence stroke high valvular AF nonvalvular AF . ii . There lack data dabigatran treatment , NOAC , valvular AF . iii . To compare dabigatran conventional treatment term prevention stroke comparing incidence silent cerebral infarct brain microbleed symptomatic stroke start study 1 year follow-up use brain MRI . This single center , prospective , randomize study evaluate effectiveness safety dabigatran versus conventional treatment patient valvular AF compare incidence silent cerebral infarct brain microbleed use brain MRI . Aspirin warfarin treatment continue patient randomly allocate conventional treatment group , change dabigatran treatment randomly allocate dabigatran group .</detailed_description>
