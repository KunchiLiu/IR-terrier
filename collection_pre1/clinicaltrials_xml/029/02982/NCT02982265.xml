	<brief_summary>Pre-eclampsia heterogeneous multisystem disorder complicate 2-8 % pregnancy remain leading cause maternal perinatal mortality morbidity . Pre-eclampsia define new onset hypertension ( define diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mm Hg systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg least two different recording take least 4-6 h apart less 7 day apart , use appropriate cuff ) substantial proteinuria ( define excretion protein ≥300 mg 24 h protein concentration ≥ 300 mg/L ≥ `` 1 + '' dipstick least two random urine sample take least 4-6 h apart 7 day apart ) 20 week gestation . Pre-eclampsia occurs presence placenta resolve delivery . However , underlie cause disease remain largely unknown .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Poor placentation consider powerful predispose factor pre-eclampsia . Recently , suggest occurrence pre-eclampsia require combination excessive atypical maternal immune response trophoblast and/or exaggerate endothelial activation well generalise hyper-inflammatory state result endothelial dysfunction associate increase vascular reactivity . Any factor ( maternal paternal constitutional , genetic environmental risk factor ) enhance response would predispose pre-eclampsia . The list predispose factor include : extreme maternal age , black race , previous history pre-eclampsia , family history pre-eclampsia , multifetal gestation , ≥ 10 year previous pregnancy , limited sperm exposure , first paternity , pregnancy donor insemination ( assisted reproductive technology ) , oocyte donation embryo donation , chronic hypertension renal disease , rheumatic disease , maternal low birth weight , obesity insulin resistance , pre-gestational diabetes mellitus , increase testosterone , increase homocysteine concentration , atherosclerosis ( increase triglyceride LDL , decrease HDL ) , maternal infection , pre-existing thrombophilia , maternal susceptibility gene hydropic degeneration placenta . Finally , smoke seem inversely correlate pre-eclampsia . Pre-eclampsia result fetal syndrome characterize fetal growth restriction , reduce amniotic fluid , abnormal oxygenation , fetal demise preterm birth . Moreover , woman pre-eclampsia increase risk abruptio placenta , disseminate coagulopathy/HELLP syndrome , pulmonary oedema , acute renal failure , eclampsia , cerebral haemorrhage , death cardiovascular renal disease . Early prediction pre-eclampsia would allow close surveillance preventive strategy</detailed_description>
