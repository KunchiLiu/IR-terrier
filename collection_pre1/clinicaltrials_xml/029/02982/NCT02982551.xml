	<brief_summary>This study evaluate effect change insulin level brain activity . Participants complete functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) scan fasting condition , insulin infusion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Insulin Modulation fMRI Connectivity Healthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Insulin hormone release pancreas response increase glucose level result food intake . In addition stimulate glucose uptake periphery , insulin signal central nervous system induce satiety inhibit feed behavior . To begin identify specific effect circulate insulin brain network , current study recruit healthy participant undergo two functional magnetic resonance imaging scan . One scan perform fasted state , alternate scan conduct isoglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp . This project allow u identify specific effect circulate insulin brain reactivity palatable food .</detailed_description>
