	<brief_summary>Losing ability walk lead few opportunity socialize friend family participate community . When happen , power wheelchair provide access home community , contribute health well-being . Training qualify occupational therapist allow individual use power wheelchair safely effectively . Learning drive power wheelchair difficult , frustrating time consume people cognitive physical challenge . In study , investigator ask participant cognitive impairment complete train occupational therapist use either share control wheelchair train method accord standard care . The investigator believe share control training , entitle Collaborative Powered mobility Innovative Learning OpporTunity ( CoPILOT ) enhance drive skill maximize safety learning . CoPILOT potential enable people participate day day live regain mobility independence .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Collaborative Power Mobility Innovative Learning OpporTunity ( CoPILOT ) - A Pilot Study New Training Approach ( Phase 2 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Powered wheelchair improve participation daily life , increase quality life , add 'life year ' individual SCI . Cognitive limitation , associate advanced age time spinal cord injury comorbid traumatic brain injury , impair learning may prevent individual acquire maintain skill necessary drive power mobility device . Standard power wheelchair training , limited time , equipment budget constraint , may meet learn need individual cognitive impairment , prevent individual obtaining use power wheelchair , impact independence quality life . The total system cost procure power wheelchair range $ 10,000 - $ 30,000 ; suboptimal use result inadequate training poor use resource come substantial social price . The Collaborative Power mobility Innovative Learning OpporTunity ( CoPILOT ) train approach utilize share control wheelchair technology allow therapist provide error-free learning experience individual environment , maintain safety user individual around . Using share control technology , wheelchair user remain control wheelchair learn drive , except case trainer override control ( use remote controlled interface ) maintain safety provide target learning opportunity . Purpose Objectives : The purpose study obtain pilot data large randomize control trial share control power wheelchair train program ( CoPILOT ) improve power wheelchair mobility skill among novice power wheelchair user comorbid cognitive impairment compare standard care . Collection pilot data necessary prior move forward large randomize control trial ( RCT ) . Hypotheses : The investigator expect intervention protocol feasible large randomize control trial . Compared standard care group , investigator expect CoPILOT group experience significant improvement power wheelchair skill capacity . The investigator also expect CoPILOT group experience improvement wheelchair skill safety , confidence , capacity divide attention task , health relate quality life , compare standard care participant . Methods : This feasibility study use evaluator blind parallel RCT . New power wheelchair user mild moderate cognitive impairment recruit GF Strong Vancouver General Hospital Spinal Cord Injury patient population . Participants randomly assign CoPILOT ( share control train ) group standard care group . All training complete qualified occupational therapist trainer . Participants group receive either 6 12 hour train standard power wheelchair ; however , CoPILOT group use remote control technology investigator develop . Post-Treatment Qualitative Interviews conduct . Questions relate protocol administration use CoPILOT approach share control technology , include necessary modification .</detailed_description>
