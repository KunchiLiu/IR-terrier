	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Randomised Acute Pain Study MR308 ( Tramadol/Celecoxib ) .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter double-blind , randomise , phase III study male female subject acute pain third molar tooth extraction . The dental procedure must involve extraction least two impacted third molar require bone removal . If two impacted third molar extract , must ipsilateral require bone removal local anaesthesia . The Screening Visit ( Visit 1 ) take place 28 day plan third molar extraction . The randomisation visit ( Visit 2 ) consist three different section , part surgery , part surgery randomisation , part randomisation post-randomisation assessment . The visit 3 4 , one respectively two day randomisation perform telephone subject participate pharmacokinetic sampling . The last dose IMP take subject 72h initial dose Completion/Discontinuation Visit ( Visit 5 ) perform . The Adverse Event ( AE ) Follow-up Visit ( Visit 6 ) last study visit do earlier seven day subject 's last dose IMP . It perform telephone .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Male/female subject ≥ 18 year day consent . 2 . Willing able provide write informed consent study . 3 . Subjects must plan elective dental procedure i.e . extraction least two impacted third molar ( one must mandibular ) require bone removal , within 28 day Screening Visit . If two impacted third molar extract , must ipsilateral require bone removal . 4 . If female childbearing potential , must use highly effective method contraception throughout study , breastfeeding , negative pregnancy test prior receive IMP . A highly effective method birth control define one result low failure rate ( i.e . le 1 % per year ) use consistently correctly sterilisation , implant , injectables , combine oral contraceptive , IUDs ( Intrauterine Device , hormonal ) , sexual abstinence vasectomise partner ) . 5 . Good general health judge Investigators basis medical history physical examination . 6 . Willingness comply study procedures requirement . Additional Inclusion Criteria Surgery : 1 . Third molar extraction complete without immediate complication . 2 . Tolerating oral fluid , uncontrolled nausea/vomiting ready take oral analgesia . 3 . The subject alert calm , spontaneously pay attention caregiver , e.g . RASS = 0 ( Sessler et al. , 2002 &amp; Ely et al. , 2003 ) . 4 . Subjects moderate severe pain ( qualify PIVAS score ≥ 45mm &lt; 70mm ≥ 70mm ) result oral surgical procedure local anaesthesia and/or sedation* . This must measure within maximum 6 hour end surgical procedure . 1 . Any abnormal laboratory value clinically significant opinion Investigator would compromise safety subject study . 2 . Any recent history frequent nausea vomiting , dizziness within last 3 month regardless etiology . 3 . Subjects medical condition treatment either warn contraindication per SmPC tramadol ( e.g . selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRIs ) , serotoninnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitor ( SNRIs ) , tricyclic antidepressant , MAO inhibitor ( within 14 day take IMP ) , antipsychotic , anticonvulsant seizure thresholdlowering medicinal product ) , celecoxib ( e.g . increase risk postoperative bleeding , active peptic ulceration , GI bleed inflammatory bowel disease ) paracetamol . 4 . Known sensitivity and/or contraindication tramadol , celecoxib , paracetamol , sulfonamide , opioids , NSAIDS , COX2 inhibitor , related compound formulation excipients well severe hypersensitivity reaction ( e.g . anaphylactic shock , bronchospasm , angioedema ) drug . 5 . Subjects know inadequate pain relief paracetamol , tramadol celecoxib . 6 . Subjects require medication prohibit per section prohibit medication . 7 . Subjects Investigators opinion consider increase risk postoperative complication e.g . major dental infection/abscess . 8 . Any history drug alcohol abuse , misuse , physical psychological dependence , mood change , sleep disturbance functional capacity impact pain perception . 9 . Significant neurological psychiatric disorder include mental instability ( unrelated pain ) could interfere pain assessment ; pain might impair assessment nociceptive pain . 10 . Any medical history significant and/or inadequately control cardiovascular ( uncontrolled high blood pressure , high risk cardiovascular event , severe heart failure ) , pulmonary , hematologic , ( include coagulopathy/bleeding disorder ) , neurological ( e.g . subject epilepsy susceptible seizure ) , liver disease ( e.g . severe hepatic impairment ) , kidney disease ( e.g . serum creatinine level great 1.5 time upper limit normal , impaired renal function subject take diuretic , ACEinhibitors , angiotensin II antagonist ) , endocrine , immunologic , dermatologic painful condition condition may compromise ability subject participate study might interfere drug absorption , distribution , metabolism excretion . 11 . Previous randomisation study . 12 . Subjects participate clinical research study involve new chemical entity experimental drug within 30 day study entry ( defined start Screening Period ) . 13 . Subjects treat regularly opioid analgesic NSAIDs within 30 day prior screen receive longacting NSAID within three day prior start surgery . 14 . Subjects receive analgesic medication ( e.g . NSAIDs , oral opioid preparation etc . ) shortacting preoperative intraoperative local anaesthetic agent within 12 hour start surgery peri operatively randomisation . 15 . Subjects incapable comply protocol . Additional Exclusion Criteria Surgery : 1 . Serious complication surgery randomisation , include : Postoperative primary secondary bleed control . Subjects third molar extraction complete plan . 2 . Postoperative medication treatment analgesic effect cause sedation amnesic effect permit may interfere study assessment . These include use ice pack , corticosteroid , nitrous oxide , benzodiazepine , alcohol , hypnotic , analgesic , opioids , psychotropic medicinal product analgesia except provide study treatment 3 . If Investigators opinion factor may confound analysis study regard efficacy safety ( e.g . PIVAS score great 90 ) .</criteria>
