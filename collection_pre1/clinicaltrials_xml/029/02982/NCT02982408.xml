A western lifestyle characterize surplus calorie , and/or low physical activity level , associate increase fat storage alter lipid metabolism play central role pathogenesis insulin resistance T2D . Using state-of-the-art large-scale integrative physiology study combine basic study adipose muscle tissue stem cell function , investigator aim determine LBW individual exhibit decrease subcutaneous adipose tissue expandability , postprandial hyperlipidaemia ectopic fat accumulation expose 4 week carbohydrate overfeeding . The investigator subsequently examine exercise training revert and/or minimize deleterious effect carbohydrate overfeed possibly birth weight differential manner .</brief_summary>
