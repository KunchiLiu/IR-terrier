	<brief_summary>This open-label , single-arm , multicenter Phase II safety efficacy study combination therapy pembrolizumab PEG-Intron ( Peginterferon alpha-2b ) patient advance cholangiocarcinoma progress tolerate frontline chemotherapy . PEG-Intron administer patient 3ug/kg ( subject possible dose modification ) subcutaneous injection weekly , pembrolizumab administer 200mg IV infusion every three week , start week 4 ( time 4th dose PEG-Intron ) . This trial design provide initial window ( 3 week ) evaluate effect PEG-Intron alone tumor microenvironment comparison prior therapy : biopsy prior treatment collect , follow , repeat tumor biopsy collect patient receive PEG-Intron . Tumor tissue collect analyzed described next paragraph .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating Combination Immunotherapy Advanced Cholangiocarcinoma With Pembrolizumab PEG-Intron</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>If survival improve patient cholangiocarcinoma , new approach urgently need prevent tumor recurrence surgical resection cholangiocarcinomas . Pembrolizumab monoclonal antibody bind program death-1 ( PD-1 ) receptor block interaction ligands PD-L1 PD-L2 , thereby release PD-1 pathway-mediated inhibition immune response , include strong anti-tumor immune response . Prognostic impact tumor-infiltrating immune cell biliary tract cancer study retrospective study 375 patient cholangiocarcinoma . High level tumor infiltrate lymphocyte cholangiocarcinoma associate good clinical outcome . Therapies target PD-1 receptor show yet unmatched rate last clinical response patient number cancer type . The response rate pembrolizumab patient advance cholangiocarcinoma 17 % phase I study . Interferon alpha 2b show increase tumor immune infiltrates . The investigator propose combine Sylatron pembrolizumab improve response rate pembrolizumab . It hypothesize Sylatron improve response rate pembrolizumab 17 % 35 % increase immune cell infiltrate tumor .</detailed_description>
