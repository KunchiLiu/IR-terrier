	<brief_summary>Rotator cuff tendinopathy ( RCT ) regard common burdensome source shoulder pain prevalence estimate high 14 % general working-age population . RCT broad entity , include vast variety diagnosis shoulder impingement syndrome , RC tendinitis/tendinosis , well subacromial bursitis . The course RCT characterise persistent pain and/or disability and/or recurrent episode . It often lead decrease function , low health-related quality life , poor sleep quality , work absenteeism , well patient 's suffering . Previous study support exercise adequate treatment RCT . Nevertheless , knowledge , study evaluate effect isoinertial training RCT . Therefore , aim study pilot method propose conduct substantive study evaluate efficacy isoinertial training plus eccentric training versus eccentric train alone improve pain function RCT . The objective evaluate : ( ) The process recruitment retention rate ; ( ii ) Willingness participant randomise ; ( iii ) The extent contamination group ; ( iv ) Participant adherence treatment . The secondary aim analyse effect isoinertial training plus eccentric training versus eccentric train alone rotator cuff strength , scapular muscle activity , scapular muscle endurance people RCT .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study design set The design present study randomize control single-blind trial 2 follow-up ( one week one month intervention ) perform January 2017 March 2017 one private physiotherapy clinic Malaga , Spain . The outcome assess baseline ( t1 ) , one week intervention ( t2 ) , one month intervention ( t3 ) . Written inform consent acquire participant prior participation . The study implement report line CONSORT statement . Recruitment Eligible participant interested study ask provide write informed consent participate . Subsequently patient-reported outcome measure complete establish baseline pain , function , rotator cuff strength , scapular muscle activity , scapular muscle endurance level self-efficacy . After completion baseline measure , participant randomly allocate isoinertial training plus eccentric eccentric training group . The measure pain , function , rotator cuff strength , scapular muscle activity , scapular muscle endurance self-efficacy repeat one week one month intervention . Anonymized age gender collect participant decline take part study assess external validity recruit sample participant . Participant data file store numerical order secure accessible place manner . Participant file maintain storage period 3 year completion study .</detailed_description>
