	<detailed_description>The implantation deep brain stimulator ( DBS ) establish option improve symptom Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) patient respond adequately medical therapy . Most center perform surgery use technique involve microelectrode record ( MER ) neuronal activity localization target nucleus , microstimulation identify target , neurological intraoperative test cooperative patient . This surgery usually perform two stage . In first stage , conscious sedation ( CS ) , target nucleus localized DBS implant . About 5 day later , general anaesthesia , programmable pulse generator implant connected DBS . The anesthetic approach varies depend institution , range local anesthesia monitor care , conscious sedation , `` asleep-awake '' `` asleep-awake-asleep '' technique . But sedative drug affect quality MER suppress fire rate basal ganglion structure , alter PD symptom . Propofol drug commonly use . Its real influence quality MER PD symptom still today controversial . In recent year , study suggest use dexmedetomidine main sedative agent intervention . Dexmedetomidine , α2-adrenergic receptor agonist , potent anxiolytic act subcortical area brain without involve GABA receptor . It provide excellent sedation without respiratory depression ; also , analgesic component predictable hemodynamic response . Low maintenance dos appear interfere MER . The possible effect dexmedetomidine PD symptom still unclear . All characteristic make good choice sedation PD patient undergo DBS surgery . Studying influence anesthetic drug basal ganglia activity PD motor symptom human clinical setting complicate . First , difficult establish control group compare effect different nuclei . There data concern clinical outcome ( clinical symptom long term stimulation parameter ) without electrophysiological data . MERs data compare different patient patient contralateral target . Few study analyze electrophysiological data without one sedative drug target .</detailed_description>
