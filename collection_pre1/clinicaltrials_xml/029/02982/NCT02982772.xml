	<detailed_description>The overall objective transdisciplinary team Human Immunology Virus ( HIV ) Tobacco fund researcher test tailor nicotine replacement dose temper excessive level enhance efficacy intervention . This accomplished assessing : 1 ) pre-trial plasma level , 2 ) genotyping , researcher knowledge use cessation study among people live HIV ( PLWH ) , 3 ) providing tailor feedback participant , base assumption higher knowledge perception risk , high interest modify risky behavior ( ) . To test researcher propose model base proven smoke prevention control method 600 PLWH ready quit smoker enrol double-blind randomized clinical trial intent-to-treat design , compare standard well-validated brief smoking intervention , follow national guideline consist brief advice + nicotine replacement therapy , versus tailor one ( brief smoke intervention + personalize dos nicotine replacement therapy ( NRT ) . The primary outcome study rate smoke cessation , point prevalence abstinence ( prior 7 prior 30 day ) , verify continuous abstinence 3- , 6- , 12-months post schedule quit day . The knowledge gain potential provide complete bio-behavioral model intervention field . The propose study successful provide new tailor , replicable , manual-based intervention people live HIV . It also provide much need information regard key mediator moderator smoke cessation intervention vulnerable population . Researchers long term goal reduce burden one devastating cause morbi-mortality researcher time improve quality life . The study could also pave path use similar model tailor smoking intervention population ( e.g. , menthol user , old woman , adolescent , old adult ) .</detailed_description>
