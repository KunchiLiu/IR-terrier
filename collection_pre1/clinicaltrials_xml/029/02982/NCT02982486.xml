	<brief_title>A Phase II Nivolumab Plus Ipilimumab Non-resectable Sarcoma Endometrial Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The expect duration study 36 month ( 18 month accrual period 18 month follow period ) . Enrollment screen treatment phase study stop actual subject number achieve . This single arm single institution , open label , prospective , phase II trial evaluate efficacy safety Nivolumab 240 mg IV every 2 week plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 6 week patient nonresectable/metastatic sarcoma endometrial carcinoma somatic deficient MMR selection tool.patients . Number patient study reflect reconciliation statistical requirement incidence . Treatment continue disease progression , development unacceptable toxicity , noncompliance withdrawal consent patient investigator decision . All screening requirement must complete within 28 day visit ( except Patients examined cycle 1 day-1 every 2 week , include complete blood count ( CBC ) chemistry , disease progression . CT/MRI imaging ( contrast ) perform every 6 week response evaluation first 48 week every 12 week thereafter . Clinical benefit well individual category response ( complete response ( CR ) , partial response ( PR ) , stable disease ( SD ) progressive disease ( PD ) determine use Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors 1.1 ( RECIST ) . Response duration endpoint , include median PFS , PFS 12 24 week OS assess use Kaplan-Meier method . Toxicity ( AEs ) record use NCI- Common Toxicity Criteria Adverse Effects v 4.03 ( NCI-CTCAE ) . Screening procedure include immunostaining MLH1 , MSH2 , MSH6 PMS2 perform formalin fix paraffin embed ( FFPE ) tissue section . In addition tumor DNA , extract FFPE tissue ( choose optimal area Pathologist ) , submit FoundationOne later exploratory analysis .</detailed_description>
