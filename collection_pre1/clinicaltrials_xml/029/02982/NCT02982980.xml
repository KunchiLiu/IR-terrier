The objective study evaluate muscle strength , range motion ( ROM ) , pain , perimetry upper limb apply questionnaire upper lim function quality life , patient surgical treatment breast cancer different postoperative period different group follow rehabilitation : traditional postoperatively exercise perform home versus traditional exercise associate weekly physiotherapy session strength train shoulder movement .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Upper Limb Muscular Strengthening Rehabilitation Patients Submitted Breast Cancer Surgical Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A clinical trial , randomize , blind study . The group divide accord type rehabilitation ( weekly session Physiotherapy-F Orientation -O ) . The surgical type ( M-Mastectomy Q-Quadrantectomy ) also take account . Were include study patient underwent previous surgery breast cancer , breast reconstruction , neurological deficit acute orthopedic shoulder injury , tendonitis bursitis , patient previous history shoulder fracture limited range motion tumor stage T4b N3 patient bone brain metastasis . All patient underwent preoperative evaluation guidance general care ; return one , two , three six month postoperatively reassessment reorientation . The physiotherapy group , addition receive guidance , , weekly , physical therapy session goal increase muscle strength upper limb , one three month surgery.The exercise perform active-free , aid stick resistance elastic band dumbbells flexion , extension , adduction , abduction , external internal rotation shoulder , elbow flexion extension , besides activity enable movement functional . The mode execution exercise isotonic , do slowly within joint amplitude reach patient , use resistance accord muscular capacity patient . All evaluation perform physiotherapy team ; professional aware whether patient belong physiotherapy group guidance group , constitute single evaluator ( blind study ) . The evaluation : muscular strength shoulder , evaluate mean manual isokinetic dynamometer , record peak force , kilogram , five second muscle contraction duration ; range motion shoulder : measure goniometer ; function upper limb : ascertained application specific questionnaire , Disabilities Arm , Shoulder Hand Questionnaire ( DASH ) assess functional capacity upper limb disease measure ability perform certain activity ; pain : evaluate application Verbal Numerical Pain Scale ( NVA ) ; perimetry : evaluate tape measure eight distinct point upper limb quality life , analyze European Organization Research Treatment Cancer ( EORTC ) Quality Life C30 ( QLQ-C30 ) questionnaire Specific module breast cancer ( BR ) 23 - Breast Specific Module .</detailed_description>
