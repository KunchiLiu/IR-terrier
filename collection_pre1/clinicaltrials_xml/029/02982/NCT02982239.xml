	<brief_summary>Evidence suggest student athlete frequently experience sleep problem aware impact sleep loss mental physical outcome . As , student athlete motivate improve sleep quality order improve outcomes overall athletic performance . This study consist two part . The first part survey . Fall athletes arrive summer , Part 1 invite 200 athlete complete survey within first week arrival campus . The survey ass multiple domains student-athlete health , namely , sleep duration quality , mood depression , stress , mental physical well-being . The response survey confidential , student compensate survey . At end semester , student invite complete survey . Part 2 intervention . 40 200 student chosen participate intervention , base predetermine criterion . The intervention include information session student may ask question . Students send text message reminder adherence program ask monitor sleep quality sleep diary . The intervention consist half 40 chosen student , ( 20 student ) , provide blue blocking glass , bright light-emitting diode ( LED ) light , fit bit . Please note item commercially available meant use treat prevent human illness injury require FDA oversight . The blue-blocking glass ensure blue light electronic device interfere circadian rhythm sleep onset , allow student fall asleep earlier . The bright LED light provide bright blue light morning help student wake amber light promote earlier bedtime . The Fitbit estimate sleep physical activity well adherence program .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Student athlete face many challenge ability maintain healthy mental physical well-being . The college experience associate number physiologic , social , environmental stressor exert long-term effect individual 's future health quality life . In addition , unique demand student-athletes , include academic , physical performance , schedule , travel demand , represent additional stressor interact produce poor outcome . Insufficient sleep duration poor sleep quality increasingly identify important risk factor physical mental well-being , especially among young adult . For example , insufficient and/or poor quality sleep strongly associate development cardiometabolic disease risk factor , obesity , depression , anxiety disorder , alcohol use , substance use , poor academic performance , reduce mental well-being , addition poorer athletic performance . Data recent PAC12 report show 2/3 student indicated lack flexible time hard thing athlete , academic work . Further , student identify sleep first thing athletic time commitment keep , 77 % felt get less sleep non-athletes , &gt; 50 % indicate would use extra hour catch sleep . In 2015 data American College Health Association , ( 1 ) 29 % student athletes report significant sleep difficulty , ( 2 ) 40 % report get enough sleep ≤3 night , ( 3 ) 10 % report problem daytime sleepiness , ( 4 ) &gt; 15 % report sleepiness least `` big problem , '' ( 5 ) &gt; 25 % report extreme difficulty fall asleep ≥3 nights/week ( consistent diagnosis insomnia ) , ( 6 ) &gt; 50 % report sleep problem impacted academic performance . Thus , student-athletes frequently experience sleep problem , recognize impact sleep loss , likely motivate improve sleep . These data consistent data professional athlete , whose overall sleep quality poor non-athletes . Taken together , sleep aspect health implicate many salient mental physical outcome among college athlete . Despite , obtain sufficient sleep represent one greatest challenge face student athlete . No programmatic approach able address problem . Accordingly , propose study aim develop assess benefit novel sleep health intervention target student-athletes . This intervention assess without assistance tool aid track sleep adjust difficult schedule order evaluate utility approach . The purpose research study develop assess benefit novel sleep health intervention target student-athletes . Overall objective AIM 1 : Assess cross-sectional relationship among sleep , circadian preference , outcomes include overall mental health , stress , mood , anxiety , social functioning , physical well-being . AIM 2 : Determine whether simple sleep health intervention , without aid technology , associate improvement mental physical well-being . Primary outcome variable ( ) AIM 1 : depression score , stress score , mental well-being score , anxiety score , physical well-being score AIM 2 : change AIM 1 outcome Secondary outcome variable ( ) Academic stress , physical performance , substance use , health behavior , soft tissue injury , miss practice , academic performance</detailed_description>
