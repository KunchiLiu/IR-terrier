	<brief_title>Pain Evaluation Venous Cannulation Predict Postoperative Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- The investigator study adult ( &gt; 18 year old ) patient go surgery site define period time . Before induction anesthesia participant ask ass ( VAS unit ) pain intensity associate peripheral venous cannulation . The maximum level postoperative pain intensity record post-anesthesia care unit . - After endpoint study , patient record review , de-identified relevant data record analyzed Statistical Package Social Sciences ( SPSS ) software . - Sample size assessment : In previous study patient score ≥ 2.0 venous cannulation assess median pain postoperatively 5.8 VAS unit compare 2.9 score &lt; 2.0 - corresponding difference maximum postoperative pain intensity almost three VAS unit . To statistically confirm , unpaired non-parametric test , 80 % power ( β ) , 95 % probability ( 1- α ) , half difference ( 1.5 VAS unit ) pain intensity level patient score 2.0 VAS unit , respectively , would require 55 patient group subject kind surgery . With 4 group case control 440 patient would need included . As study strictly observational , 600 patient include make possible miss data . - Statistics : The Mann-Whitney U- test use compare difference postoperative pain intensity level , Pearson Chi-square test compare proportion patient moderate severe postoperative pain , patient differ pain score ( 2.0 VAS unit ) venous cannulation . Logistic regression analysis use adjust gender age evaluate predictive ability propose method .</detailed_description>
