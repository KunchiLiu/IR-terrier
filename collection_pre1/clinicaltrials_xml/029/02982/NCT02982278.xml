	<detailed_description>Stroke common cause disability , subject survive stroke leave debilitate sequela . The human brain able self-repair adapt injury neuroplasticity , crucial stroke recovery . At present , recovery completely predict clinical stroke variable . A promising theory suggest health status stroke host important stroke severity recovery . Within neurological system , health reflect integrity brain tissue neuronal environment , provide neuroplastic potential necessary recovery . The potential neuroplasticity likely variable across individual possibly account differences outcome explain clinical factor . A good understanding relationship stroke outcome , host brain tissue integrity recovery environment would immense potential address stroke related disability . The investigator expert research involve brain tissue integrity use neuroimaging recovery environment use community base participation approach involve nurse-guided community health worker ( CHWs ) . This research project evaluate relationship cardiovascular risk factor , degree physical mental activity prior stroke , brain tissue integrity , post-stroke community participation neurological recovery stroke . The investigator recruit study biracial cohort , gain insight possible mechanism explain adverse risk profile , commonly present African-Americans non-Hispanic Whites stroke belt , translate less favorable recovery post stroke . If good understand underlying reason observation define , important first step toward eliminate disparity achieve .</detailed_description>
