	<brief_summary>Charcot Marie Tooth ( CMT ) common inherit neuropathy . It affect nerve hand foot first , slowly progress towards centre body . It cause vary degree weakness reduce feeling , usually affect foot ankle first . High incidence fall knock effect quality life common . This lifelong condition , though life limiting , cure . Research effect balance rehabilitation people CMT limit traditional exercise , address complex nature balance impairment condition . Multi-sensory rehabilitation prove beneficial improve balance people sensory neuropathy . Research show strengthen trunk muscle improve balance old people . Trunk muscle close largely unaffected people CMT , therefore muscle could strengthen patient . This study propose assess feasibility multi-sensory balance training , strength training focus trunk muscle close trunk , fall management education . This comprehensive approach reflective clinical physiotherapy programme . Though life-long condition , many people CMT lead full life . A home base programme propose patient fit life without travel treatment . Therapists use self-management principle within treatment . Measurements take prior follow treatment include physical measure , questionnaire interview . The physiotherapy intervention teach home data collection National Hospital Neurology Neurosurgery , University College London Hospitals ( UCLH ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BALTiC Study : A Feasibility Analysis Home Based BALance Training People With Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A recent , unpublished focus group study people CMT find report fall healthy people . They report problem walk uneven surface , difficulty get floor necessity consciously think every step avoid fall walk ( GM Ramdharry et al. , 2015 ) . A retrospective survey people CMT find 89 % 94 respondent report fall ground . Half report fall least month 5 % fall every day ( Ramdharry et al. , 2011 ) . We complete exploratory study factor predict fall risk . Preliminary analysis prospective fall data 32 people 6 month show fell median 4 time ( range 0 - 54 fall ) functional balance performance may predictive ( Ramdharry et al. , 2015 ) . A study people CMT1a find sensory impairment increase visual dependence static balance task ( van der Linden et al. , 2010 ) . There one small study balance training people CMT , compare novel rehabilitation device traditional exercise ( Matjacić Zupan , 2006 ) . Both intervention show improvement functional balance score . Studies proximal strength training CMT show improvement walk parameter ( Chetlin et al. , 2004; Lindeman et al. , 1995 ) , effect balance explore . Because mixed sensori-motor presentation people CMT , combine approach multi-sensory balance training proximal strengthening deliver . A home-based model propose CMT life-long condition need manage individual outside medical therapy environment . STUDY DESIGN &amp; JUSTIFICATION A single blind randomise controlled design choose feasibility study . The intention see effect intervention later explore large randomize control trial . A blinded assessor measure balance performance prior randomisation follow 12 week either intervention control . They also undertake qualitative interview prior randomization follow final measurement session . Interviews inform intervention acceptability . All participant receive fall assessment fall education . Following randomisation , participant either receive 12-week intervention control period . The intervention include holistic programme physiotherapy include strength training muscle group unaffected condition multi-sensory exercise target balance . The program deliver physiotherapist train deliver treatment principle self-management . Exercises carry patient home monitor research physiotherapist , progress appropriate . Those randomize control arm receive monitor telephone call throughout 12-week period . RECRUITMENT Patients recruited outpatient neurology clinic Queen Square specialise diagnosis management CMT . Patients fit inclusion criterion approach trial described . Written information provide arrangement make way make contact decide whether wish proceed screen . All patient agree proceed go screen take place telephone . Those pass screening provide fall diary postcard arrangement fall diary email , ask monitor report one month . A sample invited qualitative interview . Arrangement make attend baseline measurement session , fall assessment , fall education follow month-long fall monitoring . Measures include : Patient report questionnaire balance confidence , mood , walk ability physical functioning 10m walk test / 6 minute walk test Berg Balance Scale Bruininks Oseretsky Test ( BOT ) BESTest Functional balance test use force plate movement analysis equipment Strength test low limbs hand Charcot Marie Tooth Examination Score ( CMTES ) A block randomisation occur follow baseline measurement fall education session allocation either control arm intervention arm . This do PI research physiotherapist remain un-blinded . Contact blind assessor cease final measurement session 12 week later . INTERVENTION : If randomise control arm study , participant advise research physiotherapist contact monthly monitor fall issue . For randomised intervention arm , home visit arrange research physiotherapist soon possible . During session , research physiotherapist provide participant exercise strengthen muscle trunk proximal muscle use body weight grade ankle weight . Strength training perform 4 time per week . They also give selection exercise target balance challenge stability sensory feedback . Participants ask perform balance exercise daily . A risk assessment undertaken guidance ensure safety exercise . An exercise diary provide participant monitor exercise frequency . Arrangements make weekly telephone call research physiotherapist monitor progress provisional date set first monthly home monitoring visit . Participants intervention arm contact weekly 12 week study . The research physiotherapist visit home monitor progress exercise month time . QUALITATIVE RESEARCH At consent meeting patient invite take part interview conduct consent meeting follow completion final measurement . They make aware participation interview supplementary main study free decline . Purposive sampling use ensure sample maximum diversity age , gender , symptom severity . Potential qualitative interview participant give write detail qualitative study ask give consent interview willing take part . The interview audio record consist dialogue interviewer ( researcher ) participant . A topic guide use interview , participant invite raise issue importance . Data analysis iterative , continually analyse throughout data collection process use inform follow interview . PROCEDURES TO DEAL WITH RESEARCHER EFFECTS AND BIAS Assessments carry blind assessor standardise treatment test . Falls assessment fall education provide baseline measurement session blind assessor , prior participant randomisation . In way participant give treatment . The blinded assessor perform final measurement . The participant remind prior start final session mention may may 12 week prior maintain blind throughout session</detailed_description>
