	<detailed_description>This study Phase 1 , open-label , dose escalation cohort expansion trial design characterize safety , tolerability , PK , PD , immunogenicity preliminary antitumor activity enoblituzumab administer IV weekly schedule 96 dos ( approximately 2 year ) child young adult B7-H3-expressing relapse refractory malignant solid tumor . The study consist Dose Escalation Phase determine MTD ( MAD ) enoblituzumab follow Cohort Expansion Phase define safety initial antitumor activity enoblituzumab . In cohort expansion phase , 5 cohort 10 patient enrolled evaluate safety potential efficacy enoblituzumab administer MTD/MAD patient with:1 ) neuroblastoma - measurable disease , 2 ) neuroblastoma - non-measurable disease , 3 ) rhabdomyosarcoma , 4 ) osteosarcoma , 5 ) Ewing 's sarcoma , Wilms ' tumor desmoplastic small round cell tumor . All tumor evaluation carry Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) immune-related response criterion ( irRC ) . Disease assessment patient neuroblastoma use neuroblastoma overall response criterion .</detailed_description>
