	<brief_summary>Background : Platelet-rich fibrin ( PRF ) bioactive glass putty show effective promote reduction probe depth , gain clinical attachment , defect fill intrabony periodontal defect . The individual role play bioactive glass putty combination PRF yet elucidate . AIM : To compare clinical effectiveness combination Plaltelet Rich Fibrin Bioactive Glass Putty Bioactive glass putty regenerative technique intrabony defect human . Material method : Ten pair intrabony defect surgically treat PRF Bioactive glass putty ( Test group ) one side bioactive glass putty ( Control group ) side . The primary outcome study include change probe depth , attachment level bone fill Osseous defect . The clinical parameter record baseline , 3 , 6 , 9 month . Radiographic assessment do use standardized intra oral periapical radiograph . Comparisions make within group baseline , 3 month , 6 month 9 month use ANOVA test follow Bonferroni test .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION Periodontitis infectious disease cause destruction attachment apparatus . [ 1 ] .The mainstay aim periodontal treatment regeneration lose attachment apparatus teeth . Variety treatment modality available periodontal regenerative therapy include bone graft , bone substitute , Guided Tissue Regeneration , growth factor , application tissue engineering combination two listed approach . [ 2 ] Alloplasts , may effective alternative allograft xenograft risk disease transmission supply unlimited . [ 3 ] The Bioactive glass promote osteogenesis adsorption concentration protein utilized osteoblast form mineralize extracellular matrix . [ 4 ] The advantage putty form bioactive glass glycerine polyethylene glycol make glass particle coherent thus enhance handle characteristic minimal migration graft particle defect site . [ 5 ] Histological evaluation material show particulate tends retard growth epithelial tissue . [ 6,7,8,9 ] Growth factor play pivotal role periodontal regeneration . Platelet Rich Fibrin believe release polypeptide growth factor , transform growth factors-ÃŸ , platelet derive growth factor , vascular endothelial growth factor matrix glycoprotein ( thrombospondin -1 ) surgical wound sustain fashion least 7 day show vitro . [ 10 ] Thus , give unique graft osteoconductive , osteoinductive osteostimulative property property autologous PRF , application combination approach attempt assessment additional benefit heal mechanism periodontal regeneration intrabony defect . Materials method Patient Selection This randomize control trial carry Department Periodontics Oral Implantology , Santosh Dental College Hospital , Santosh University , Ghaziabad . Ten patient suffer chronic localize periodontitis age 20 -50 year ( 7 male 3 female ) 10 pairs contalateral intraosseous defect ( n=20 ) comprise study population . A total 20 bone defect ( 10 pair ) decide statisticion statistical strength . Convenient sample design use enrolment study patient . Ethical approval take institutional ethical committee The patient explain detail procedure write informed consent take . The intrabony defect diagnose clinically moderate deep periodontal pocket &gt; = 5mm clinical radiographic evidence vertical/angular osseous defect . [ 3 ] Patients systemic disease , anticoagulant , habit smoking alcohol , know history allergy graft material undergone periodontal surgical treatment chronic periodontitis within twelve month defect exclude study . PRESURGICAL THERAPY Patients underwent phase I therapy . The select defect evaluate 2 week , persistent pocket &gt; = 5mm patient clinical radiographic evidence angular osseous defect schedule surgery . Clinical Parameters : Oral hygiene status record use gingival index Loe &amp; Sillness , [ 11 ] ; score 0 indicate absence inflammation score 3 indicate severe inflammation plaque index Silness &amp; Loe . [ 12 ] Probing pocket depth Clinical attachment level record baseline day surgery , 3 , 6 9 month interval use UNC-15 probe customize acrylic occlusal stent groove area defect provide reproducible insertion axis- The following measurement record customized acrylic stent : - Fixed reference point ( FRP ) base pocket ( BP ) - Fixed reference point ( FRP ) cemento-enamel junction ( CEJ ) - Fixed reference point ( FRP ) gingival margin ( GM ) PPD CAL calculate probe measurement : - PPD = ( FRP BP ) - ( FRP GM ) - CAL= ( FRP BP ) - ( FRP CEJ ) Radiographic measurement : Standardized intra-oral periapical radiograph defect take use parallel technique . [ 13 ] Amount defect fill : Defects measure fixed reference point ( distance cemento-enamel junction radiographic base bone defect ) help 1.1 mm grid follow radiographic feature record day surgery , 3 , 6 9 month interval .</detailed_description>
