	<brief_summary>Despite improvement management , mortality severe traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) remain 25 % 40 % patient survive without major handicap . Medical/surgical intervention aim maintain adequate brain perfusion , critically dependent cerebral perfusion pressure ( CPP ) ; calculate difference mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) intracranial pressure ( ICP ) . Current guideline aim CPP 50 mmHg , base population mean . However , 'one size fit ' approach flaw , relation CPP brain perfusion varies individual . Further , approach take account autoregulation , key protective mechanism maintain cerebral perfusion despite CPP fluctuation . Autoregulation variably preserve follow TBI , large patient variance 'optimal ' CPP ( CPPopt ) autoregulation operate best . Individual CPPopt retrieve automatically plot autoregulation data CPP certain time window . The investigator show maintenance CPP close CPPopt associate improved outcome . These data pose hypothesis optimisation management individual may achieve use zone optimal autoregulation basis define individualise CPP target . The investigator propose , together collaborator CPPopt study group ( Maastricht , Cambridge , Leuven Aachen ) set pilot ( multicenter ) feasibility study develop protocol definitive outcome randomize control trial ( RCT ) . This study aim develop protocol CPPopt guide critical care , show maintain patient closer optimum perfusion level standard protocol keep population CPP threshold 60 mmHg . Hence , main objective offer clinicians monitor therapy algorithm achieve individualize optimal CPPopt target potentially improve TBI outcome .</brief_summary>
