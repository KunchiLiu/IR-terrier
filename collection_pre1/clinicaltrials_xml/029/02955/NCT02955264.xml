	<brief_summary>The goal study well characterize metabolic alteration sugar structure alteration ( glycosylation abnormality ) patient diagnose Congenital Disorders Glycosylation . The investigator aim assess safety tolerability oral galactose treatment small pilot group Congenital Disorders Glycosylation patient . The investigator also determine relationship simple milk sugar intake ( galactose dose ) diet blood urine marker protein glycosylation abnormality .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Using D-Galactose Food Supplement Congenital Disorders Glycosylation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary hypothesis study add simple milk sugar ( galactose ) diet Congenital Disorders Glycosylation patient normalize metabolic abnormality . The secondary hypothesis posit galactose intervention Congenital Disorders Glycosylation patient normalize specific physiological biomarkers protein glycosylation utilized future phase II/III trial development . The knowledge gain investigation two aim help investigator learn disrupt metabolic mechanism disease lead identification new disease biomarkers use evaluate clinical efficacy future therapeutic trial . Over two-year period , investigator enroll patient diagnose Congenital Disorders Glycosylation . The investigator propose administer oral galactose supplementation period 18 week increase dose ass effectiveness normalize glycosylation . Galactose give series dos within range normal dietary intake galactose fixed time point . To assess effect oral galactose supplementation participant , change participant growth , well blood sugar level , coagulation parameter liver function ( primary clinical feature Congenital Disorders Glycosylation ) correlate biomarkers derive participant blood urine sample obtain key time point compare standard normative range data measure .</detailed_description>
