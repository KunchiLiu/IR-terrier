	<brief_summary>Current iodine requirement define pregnancy lactation rough factorial estimate extrapolate old study adult use radioactive iodine tracer . To ensure optimal thyroid function vulnerable group , tracer method could safely use accurately define iodine requirement would valuable . Iodine-129 ( 129I ) , long-lived semi-stable isotope health risk , could use tracer , analytic challenge formidable . However , develop ICP-MS method measure pp-billion ( 10-9 ) pp-trillion ( 10-12 ) quantities 129I biological sample . In project perform study iodine-replete adult subject consume oral dose 129I . We quantify 129I kinetic pattern plasma , urine stool oral dose , use data derive tracer absorption , retention excretion rate . This trial allow u define optimize procedure routine application method ass iodine metabolism human . The use 129I may prove breakthrough technique safely assess iodine metabolism requirement pregnant/lactating woman order ensure healthy thyroid function age group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Experimental design . The experimental design pilot-trial foresees administration physiological oral dose 12 µg 129I ( tracer ) healthy adult couple quantitative measurement tracer concentration plasma , urine , stool sample collect prior follow tracer administration . A single dose 12 µg 129I corresponds level activity 78.5 Bq exposure adult 0.16 mSv thyroid target organ . Baseline plasma sample collect administration tracer ( -5 min ) follow-up sample collect 15 , 30 , 45 , 60 , 90 min , well 2 , 4 , 8 , 24 , 48 , 72 , 96 hour follow tracer administration . Complete urine collect period 8 day : baseline sample 1 day tracer dose ( Day 3 ) follow-up sample 7 day thereafter ( Day 10 ) . Similarly , complete stool collection do day tracer dose ( Day 3 ) well 3 follow day ( Day 6 ) . At Day 20 40 ( follow-up ) , blood sample spot urine collection repeat verify washed period . Baseline sample use baseline-correction post-administration sample . In order minimize variability response purpose pilot-trial , participant consume standardize diet first 6 day trial keep food diary last 4 day trial . After suitable preparation , plasma , urine stool sample analyze tracer quantification ( determination 129I mass 127I mass ; 127I naturally occur iodine ) . From data , construct pharmacokinetic curve tracer appearance clearance blood , urine , stool derive rate time human iodine absorption , retention excretion . In addition , iodine speciation perform use iodine speciation base chromatography method couple ICP-MS direct mass quantification iodine specie plasma inorganic iodine ( PII ) protein-bound iodine ( PBI ) . This provide additional level information separate pharmacokinetics metabolize metabolize 129I . Because uptake thyroid determinant fraction tracer retain , characterization participant ' thyroid function important control potential variation calculate retention subject , thyroglobulin thyroid hormone whole blood assess . Methods analysis . The tracer concentration plasma , urine stool measure high resolution multi collector ICP-MS isotope dilution analysis ( IDA ) use tellurium internal standard follow sample digestion accord method recently develop laboratory [ Dold et al , Thyroid 2015 ] . For additional speciation 129I plasma , analysis perform use ion chromatography ICP-MS analysis ( IC-ICP-MS ) Federal Food Safety Veterinary Office , Swizterland . Urinary iodine concentration measure mean Sandell-Kolthoff reaction [ Pino et al , Clin Chem 1996 , 42:239-243 ] laboratory . Thyroglobulin assess use ELISA dry blood spot method recently develop laboratory [ Stinca et al , Thyroid 2015 , 25:1297-1305 ] . Thyroid hormone measure University Hospital Zurich , Switzerland , use DELFIA ( dissociation-enhanced lanthanide fluorescent immunoassay ) method . Iodine content standardize diet measured laboratory ICP-MS analysis data food diary evaluate use nutrition software EBIS-Pro ( University Hohenheim ) . Data analysis evaluation . The data generate pilot-trial used construct pharmacokinetic curve tracer appearance clearance collect sample ( total plasma , plasma PII-fraction , plasma PBI-fraction , urine , stool ) . Curves construct fit LOESS multiple regression model , non-parametric locally weighted scatter plot smooth tracer concentration sample function time , provide uncertainty range visually represent tracer 's pharmacokinetic pattern variability response . For evaluation tracer kinetic pattern generate classic pharmacokinetic modelling parameter , include maximum tracer concentration ( cmax ) , time maximum tracer concentration ( Tmax ) , elimination rate constant ( ke ) , absorption rate constant ( ka ) , area curve ( AUC ) , use simulation analysis model software SAAM II ( University Washington ) . Total tracer retention calculate total tracer intake - total tracer excrete ( AUCurine + AUCstool ) . Total tracer absorption calculate total tracer intake - total tracer appearance plasma inorganic iodine ( AUCPII ) . The optimization procedures routine application method mainly include definition minimal requirement specimen 's specific sample duration ( number day ) administration tracer dose . This assess use ROC curve . Expected output significance/ expect impact . This study first use 129I biologic tracer human . Once developed , availability novel method would provide unique tool address several key issue regard human iodine metabolism thyroid function . These include precise definition iodine requirement important life stage , investigation potential up-regulation iodine absorption iodine deficiency , thyroid uptake turnover iodine vary iodine status , assessment placental breast milk iodine transfer , well assessment iodine bioavailability different food . Thus , project could significant long term impact field iodine thyroid .</detailed_description>
