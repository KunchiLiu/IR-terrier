	<brief_title>Significance Circulating Tumor Cells Treatment Gastric Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Laparoscopic surgery represent milestone treatment gastric rectal cancer , advantage minimal invasion rapid recovery compare open approach . However , progressive gastric rectal cancer , laparoscopic approach officially promote NCCN guideline ( 2015 ) . Over past decade , circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) , originated tumor cell , identify potential blood-based biomarkers capable provide prognostic predictive Information . In present study , investigator utilize CTCBIOPSY® system ( YZYBIO Company , Wuhan , China ) , approve CFDA ( Chinese Food Drug Administration ) , detect CTCs , try compare short-term long-term treatment effect laparoscopic vs. open approach progressive gastric rectal cancer , base circulate tumor cell ( CTC ) test result well disease-free survival , figure principle laparoscopic approach progressive gastric rectal cancer . Secondary purpose establish evaluation system laparoscopic surgery progressive gastric rectal cancer treatment use CTC biomarker .</detailed_description>
