	<brief_title>PET/CT Guided Antifungal Stewardship Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis ( IPA ) 3rd frequent invasive mycosis France rise incidence 40 % mortality ( Bitar , 2014 , Lortholary , 2011 ) . Modern antifungal ( AF ) improve survival IPA lead ecological , toxic cost issue . In agreement `` plan national de la bonne maîtrise des anti-infectieux `` , optimization AF duration IPA appear therefore challenging . Positron emission tomography use 2-deoxy-2- [ fluorine-18 ] fluoro- D-glucose integrate compute tomography ( 18F-FDG PET/CT ) report allow shorten AF duration ( Hot , 2011 , Chamilos , 2008 ) currently evaluate chronic disseminate candidiasis { CANHPARI trial , PHRC 2012 , NCT01916057 } . The investigator raise hypothesis normalization functional image 18F-FDG-PET/CT IPA could occur early conventional imaging . However , due current lack data , intervention trial evaluate early AF withdrawal base 18F-FDG-PET/CT appear premature . In order optimize IPA treatment duration , two-step evaluation project design . The first step consist OPTIFIL prospective project . It evaluate therapeutic response systematic 18F-FDG-PET/CT week 6 ( crucial time point ( Segal ) use recent IPA trial ( Marr , 2015 , Maertens , 2016 ) . The latter response correlate kinetics select biomarkers include antigen ( galactomannan , β-D glucans ) , circulate Aspergillus DNA anti-Aspergillus host response marker addition conventional imaging tool obtain week 6 12 . OPTIFIL project result serve establish decision algorithm use second step intervention trial evaluate accuracy IPA AF interruption . Pilot prospective multicenter study therapeutic follow-up IPA patient hematological malignancy . Patients inclusion visit ( D0 ) 8 9 follow visit : D3 , W1 , W2 , W4 , W6 , End Treatment , W24 W48 . Each visit include physical examination . Lung CT scan , 18F-FDG-PET/CT , sampling blood perform different visit respective center β-D-Glucan , Aspergillus fumigatus Aspergillus spp . quantitative PCRs host biomarkers Aspergillus Elispot perform centralize Response evaluation assess independent committee . CT response evaluate blinded radiologist . PET/CT response evaluate 2 blind nuclear medicine physician .</detailed_description>
