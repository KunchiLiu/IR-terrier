	<brief_summary>Chronic ankle instability common problem may follow ankle sprain . Until patient develop chronic ankle instability ineligible surgical treatment although early surgical treatment yield well result compare surgical treatment subject experience recurrent ankle sprain . However , treat patient ankle sprain surgically option due high amount unnecessary invasive intervention . The objective study identify patient develop chronic ankle instability develop model predict patient receive early surgical treatment . In prospective observational cohort patient ( old 18 year ) report emergency department participate hospital lateral ankle sprain , x-ray make positive Ottawa Ankle Rules visible fracture pathology . The main study parameter significant difference patient characteristic , foot ankle configuration joint pathology patient develop chronic ankle instability patient experience recurrent ankle sprain restriction daily live initial sprain .</brief_summary>
