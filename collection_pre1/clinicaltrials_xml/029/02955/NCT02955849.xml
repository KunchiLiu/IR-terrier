	<brief_summary>Aims Objectives ( Quantitative ) Aim : To compare effectiveness selective laser trabeculoplasty trabeculoplasty lower intraocular pressure patient medically uncontrolled open angle glaucoma rural China , take account impact patient acceptance type treatment Hypothesis : Mean intraocular pressure treatment selective laser trabeculoplasty lower surgery due high acceptance rate among patient randomize receive treatment therefore treatment provide earlier stage disease progression .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial China Laser Surgery Study Glaucoma Rural China</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Glaucoma one three lead cause blindness China . Although condition control medication lower intraocular pressure , treatment must continue patient 's lifetime . This practical resource-poor setting due cost inconvenience patient . Trabeculectomy standard treatment offer rural China rarely use follow issue : 1. need hospitalization , increase patient expense inconvenience 2. high refusal rate patient ocular surgery 3. high rate infection due poor quality instrument material 4. need multiple follow-up visit post-surgery ( early work show return rate 30 % 1 month post-surgery among rural patient China ) . A viable alternative patient rural China selective laser trabeculoplasty , base follow advantage : 1. simplicity ( do 5-minute out-patient procedure require topical anaesthesia ) 2. effectiveness ( 18-32 % reduction intraocular pressure , comparable medication ) 3. safety ( complication rare include serious infectious trabeculotemy ) 4. convenience ( minimal follow-up , one visit within 6 week post-surgery ) 5. cost-effectiveness ( compare glaucoma therapy many setting ) 6. acceptability patient ( due low-cost out-patient care easy follow-up ) . Study Design ( Quantitative ) This phase propose China Laser Surgery Study research project multi-centre open-label pragmatic randomise control trial . Expected timeline : - Enrolment : 12 month - Follow-up : 12 month - Data analysis : 4 month Patient Population Setting : Patients present glaucoma rural hospital ( n=4 ) Guangdong province , China , currently capable perform trabeculectomy surgery , provide selective laser trabeculoplasty machine training use . Sample Size : One hundred ninety patient ( 95 group ) need obtain power 0.90 , two-sided alpha 0.05 . Patients unit randomization . Expected IOP difference group 3.0 mm Hg + 4.0 mmg HG , correlation 0.30 baseline final intraocular pressure , allow loss follow 30 % . Baseline Data : aseline data ( collect prior determination eligibility randomization obtain informed consent ) include follow : - Presence absence relevant pre-existing health condition ( i.e. , hypertension , diabetes , cardiovascular disease ) - Ophthamologic test result - Best correct visual acuity present visual acuity eye - Intraocular pressure eye - Cup disk ratio eye - presence absence visually significant cataract eye ; cataract present study eye , whether cataract surgery already perform - degree visible Trabecular Meshwork study eye gonioscopy without `` dynamic gonioscopy '' - score glaucoma knowledge test use simple , previously validate questionnaire - Demographic data - date birth self-reported age year - sex - Contact information - Address - mobile phone number reach ( neighbour , etc . ) - Socioeconomic status - complete education year - wealth , measure ownership item pre-determined list 13 common household device China - job title/description - Level difficulty travel hospital eye clinic - distance travel - time spent travel - direct out-of-pocket cost travel , meal , etc . Main analysis : - Following requirement intention-to-treat analysis , measure mean intraocular pressure 12 month compare two group adjust baseline intraocular pressure , include subject accept refused treatment ( primary analysis , unadjusted ) . We also measure intraocular pressure , adjust cataract surgery , age , gender , prior use medication , degree open angle study eye baseline , severity glaucoma ( Cup disk ratio ) study eye baseline ( primary analysis , adjust ) . Both analysis repeat use per protocol approach ( include patient accept assigned therapy , secondary analysis ) . - We test difference baseline characteristic study group t-tests ( continuous variable ) Chi-square test ( categorical variable ) . We use generalized linear model Poisson regression ( variable binary outcome ) linear regression ( variable continuous outcome ) estimate relative risk intervention arm . Multiple imputation Stata 13.1 ( StataCorp , College Station , TX , USA ) use address miss data . All statistical analysis perform use Stata 13.1 . A two-tailed P-value &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant .</detailed_description>
