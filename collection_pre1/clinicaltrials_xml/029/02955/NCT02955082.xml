	<brief_summary>Prostate cancer ( PrCa ) one commonest cancer men Western world , 40,000 new case diagnosed year United Kingdom ( UK ) . Research study identify several genetic change think increase risk develop prostate cancer . Some genetic change occur deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) repair gene . The BARCODE 2 study form two part aim investigate genetic change DNA repair gene affect response treatment . In part 1 study , investigator invite men metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer ( mCRPC ) genetic test join study initially undergoing genetic screening within study . If pathogenic mutation confirm one gene , patient give option proceed part 2 study . In part 2 study , men mCRPC know carrier mutation DNA repair gene ( ) assess eligibility treatment study . The aim study determine patient mCRPC germline mutation DNA repair gene ( ) respond platinum chemotherapy . This study help researcher investigate platinum sensitivity prostate tumour develop due germline mutation DNA repair gene . This study provide data use large clinical trial platinum chemotherapy base patient ' germline genetic signature and/or tumour genetic profile .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The BARCODE 2 Study - The Use Genetic Profiling Guide Prostate Cancer Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose Design BARCODE 2 single arm , single site phase II study aim determine response rate two cycle platinum chemotherapy patient mCRPC germline mutation DNA repair gene . Response measure prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) level radiological assessment . The study divide two part . In part 1 study , enrol patient ' DNA repair gene mutation carrier status assess use gene panel . Men find carry pathogenic mutation already know carry germline mutation enrol part 2 study offer treatment carboplatin . Eligibility Recruitment Patients mCRPC progress docetaxel abiraterone enzalutamide may assess eligibility study entry . Inclusion Criteria All study participant assess accord part 1 and/ part 2 inclusion criterion depend part study enter initially . Informed Consent Participants give current ethically approve BARCODE 2 patient information sheet consideration . Patients ask consent study sufficient time consider trial , opportunity ask question . Patients previous genetic test sign part 1 consent form undergo genetic profiling germline mutation DNA repair gene . Patients find pathogenic mutation part 1 already know carry germline mutation must sign part 2 consent form prior undergoing part 2 study related procedure . Patient Confidentiality Patients ask consent full name collect trial entry addition date birth , hospital number , postcode National Health Service ( NHS ) number equivalent allow linkage routinely collect NHS data ensure accuracy handle biological sample . Investigators ensure participant ' personal identifier information keep separate log . Investigators retain trial document strict confidence . Investigators maintain confidentiality participant time reproduce disclose information third party participant could identify ( without consent ) . Data Protection The study comply applicable data protection law . Subject Withdrawal Participants may discontinue trial time request , may discontinue trial treatment discretion Principal Investigator ( PI ) . Reasons discontinuation include : - Clinical radiological disease progression . - Unacceptable toxicity ( e.g . unresolving grade ≥2 neuropathy neutropenia ) - Any reason deem appropriate investigator . Increases PSA criterion treatment discontinuation absence clinical radiological progression . Participants discontinue treatment continue follow death . Post-treatment Follow-up Follow data collect patient enter part 2 study death , include cause death . Participants discontinue treatment continue follow death . Discontinuation Follow-up If patient withdraws follow-up trial deviation form submit Oncogenetics Team state whether patient withdrawn consent information send Oncogenetics Team whether simply longer wish attend trial follow visit . In rare event patient request data remove study entirely , implication discuss patient first ensure intent , confirm , Oncogenetics Team notify write . If request receive result publish course action agree Sponsor Independent Data Monitoring Steering Committee . Trial Management A Trial Management Group ( TMG ) set include Chief Investigator , Trial Statistician Trial Manager . Key study personnel invite join TMG appropriate ensure representation range professional group , include PI Participant Identification Centre ( PIC ) . The TMG meet regular interval , least annually . Independent Data Monitoring Steering Committee ( IDMSC ) A joint Independent Data Monitoring Steering Committee ( IDMSC ) set oversee safety trial participant , monitor data produce trial , put data overall context supervise progress trial towards interim overall objective . Publication Data Sharing Policy The main trial result publish peer-reviewed journal , behalf collaborator . Anonymised data apply via Data Access Committee .</detailed_description>

Histologically confirm prostate adenocarcinoma . A copy original histology report biopsy surgery must obtain . 3 . Castrationresistant disease define biochemical radiological progression on/after treatment orchidectomy Luteinizing hormonereleasing hormone ( LHRH ) analogues per PCWG3 criterion . 4 . Confirmed metastatic disease conventional imaging method compute tomography ( CT ) , bone scan positron emission tomography ( PET ) imaging . 5 . Current previous treatment include docetaxel and/or enzalutamide/ abiraterone 6 . Adequate renal function measure calculated glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) ( CockcroftGault ) &gt; 30ml/min . This must document within 7 day registration . If patient renal dysfunction expect improve , may consider part 1 study 7 . Adequate haematological function ( haemoglobin ≥10g/dl , neutrophil count &gt; 1.5x109/L platelet &gt; 100x109/L ) . This must document within 7 day registration . 8 .

Patients stable , treated brain metastasis eligible provide informed consent give sit measurable disease present 11 . The subject capable understanding comply protocol requirement sign BARCODE 2 inform consent form . In addition , Part 2 study : 1 . Confirmed pathogenic germline mutation DNA repair gene . ( Patients know germline mutation need provide report external laboratory genetic test carry ) 2 . Previous treatment docetaxel abiraterone enzalutamide document disease progression prior entry part 2 ( rise PSA and/or radiographic progression ) 3 . Adequate liver function : Total bilirubin ≤1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) except patient know Gilbert 's syndrome ; aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) ≤ 2.5x ULN presence liver metastasis . 4 .
