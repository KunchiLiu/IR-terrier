	<brief_summary>This study Phase Ib open label , single arm , adaptive multicentre trial . Patients newly diagnose Multiple Myeloma ( MM ) treat Cyclophosphamide-Bortezomib-Dexamethasone ( CyBorD ) combination Daratumumab ( DARA ) . The safety profile daratumumab date , appear overlap know approved agent , combine distinct MoA , suggest therapeutic profile daratumumab combine various backbone regimen may improve treatment effect regimens . Additionally , daratumumab single agent may prolong progression free interval patient . Based potential cyclophosphamide enhance ADCP , strong rationale combine DARA cyclophosphamide , bortezomib contain regimen . This first clinical trial explore feasibility combine daratumumab cyclophosphamide contain backbone induction regimen successful provide rationale large study explore efficacy combination great detail .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study consist 2 phase : - The Screening Phase extend 28 day prior Cycle 1 , Day 1 . - The Treatment Phase conduct 2 part extend Cycle 1 Day 1 treatment discontinuation . Treatment Phase , Part 1 : Induction/Transplantation/Consolidation Phase . The consolidation phase treatment begin approximately 30-60 day Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation ( ASCT ) , patient recover sufficiently engraftment complete . Treatment Phase , Part 2 : Maintenance Phase treatment maximum duration 2 year , document disease progression , death , loss follow-up , withdrawal consent , whichever occur first .</detailed_description>

Patients woman childbearing potential male partner woman childbearing potential must agree use adequate contraception method sign informed consent form least 100 day last study drug administration . Childbearing potential define woman undergone hysterectomy bilateral oophorectomy ; naturally postmenopausal least 12 consecutive month ( i.e . menses time precede 12 consecutive month ) . The investigator designate associate require advise patient achieve adequate birth control . Highly effective contraception define study method achieve failure rate le 1 % per year use consistently correctly . Such method include : combine ( oestrogen progestogen contain ) hormonal contraception associate inhibition ovulation ( oral , intravaginal , transdermal ) progestogenonly hormonal contraception associate inhibition ovulation ( oral , injectable implantable ) , intrauterine device ( IUD ) , intrauterine hormone release system ( IUS ) , bilateral tubal occlusion , successfully vasectomised partner sexual abstinence .
