	<brief_summary>This study aim compare effect retardation myopia progression combine ortho-k 0.01 % atropine therapy ortho-k alone.Myopia control method mainly focus optical pharmaceutical intervention . Currently , overnight-wear orthokeratology ( ortho-k ) , use extensively Hong Kong approximately 50 % retardation effect . Pharmaceutical method focus use atropine eye drop slow myopic progression.The use 1 % atropine limited manifestation side effect rebound effect.However , side effect rebound effect minimal 0.01 % atropine.It suggest 0.01 % optimum concentration control myopia.The mechanism neither ortho-k atropine myopia control fully understood.It believe ortho-k atropine act via different mechanisms.It possible combine two method , additional retardation myopia progression could achieve .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Although believe myopia result interplay genetic environmental factor progression attribute lack outdoor activity intensive school work , myopia control method mainly focus optical pharmaceutical intervention . Use bifocal multifocal lens show ineffective myopia control . Specially design soft contact lenses myopia control recently launch , effectiveness yet confirm . Currently , overnight-wear orthokeratology ( ortho-k ) , involve reshape cornea overnight wear allow improve , frequently unaided , vision day , use extensively Hong Kong . Approximately 50 % retardation axial length elongation observe study patient receive ortho-k ( LORIC study , 46 % , ROMIO study,43 % , TO-SEE study , 52 % ) . Pharmaceutical method focus use atropine eye drop slow myopic progression . The use 1 % atropine first suggest 1990 's , application limit manifestation side effect pupil dilatation loss accommodation . The effectiveness low concentration ( 0.5 % , 0.1 % 0.01 % ) evaluate recent five-year randomized clinical trial , author report 0.01 % atropine daily effective result 50 % spherical equivalent reduction . However , result one year ( 3rd year ) discontinuation atropine five-year study . Rebound effect minimal 0.01 % atropine high dosage associate manifest rebound effect , appear negate former myopia retardation effect . Only 24 % receive 0.01 % progress 0.50D discontinuation one year . By contrast , proportion child progress 0.50D 0.5 % 0.1 % group 59 % 68 % respectively . Moreover , use 0.01 % atropine show sustain myopia reduction clinically negligible effect pupil dilatation loss accommodation . The author suggest use 0.01 % optimum concentration control myopia . The mechanisms neither ortho-k atropine myopia control fully understood . It believe ortho-k atropine act via different mechanism , ortho-k slow myopia progression reduce peripheral hyperopic defocus , atropine exerts effect anti-muscarinic receptor retina sclera . However , subject respond poorly either atropine ortho-k , demonstrate clinical trial , suggest single treatment may enough . It possible combine two method , additional retardation myopia progression could achieve . In randomized trial , explore effectiveness combination ortho-k atropine therapy , evaluate additional effect compare combination ortho-k treatment alone .</detailed_description>
