	<brief_summary>This multicentre , open-label , phase II study ibrutinib 560 mg combination R-ICE treatment transplant-eligible relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>RICE-ibrutinib Relapsed DLBCL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patient receive R-ICE therapy 2 cycle follow PET-CT assessment ( PET-2 ) . Ibrutinib 560 mg add RICE regimen base result PET-2 follow : - Patients CR continue 2 cycle R-ICE proceed onto ASCT . These patient receive ibrutinib . - In patient stable disease achieve response less CR , ibrutinib 560 mg add . The combination ibrutinib-RICE give 2 cycle follow PET-CT assessment ( PET-4 ) . Patients achieve ≥ PR point proceed onto ASCT . - Patients disease progression remove trial . Hematopoietic stem cell harvest perform follow count recovery cycle R-ICE , preferably cycle 2 . Transplant condition regimen standard BEAM chemotherapy ( carmustine , etoposide , cytarabine , melphalan ) . Following ASCT , ibrutinib give maintenance therapy patient achieve CR time PET-2 assessment . This continue 1 year ASCT .</detailed_description>
