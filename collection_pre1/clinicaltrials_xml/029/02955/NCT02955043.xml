	<brief_title>Biobehavioral Intervention Enhance Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Recovery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hematologic cancer patient undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) frequently experience physical psychological sequela impair quality life undermine recovery . Findings investigator ' laboratory others indicate insomnia , fatigue , depression among persistent , distress , debilitate quality-of-life concern HSCT . These symptom co-occur `` cluster '' among cancer patient . Modifying sleep circadian rest-activity pattern suggest particularly promising intervention strategy alleviate symptom cluster . The propose project therefore evaluate feasibility acceptability biobehavioral intervention alleviate insomnia , fatigue , depression optimize sleep rest-activity pattern first 4 month follow HSCT . Evidence-based behavioral strategy enhance quality nighttime sleep increase engagement non-sedentary daytime activity combine optimize 24-hour rest-activity pattern . These non-pharmacologic approach teach brief session deliver individual format tailor patient . The investigator already refine intervention base preliminary feasibility test small sample HSCT recipient conduct pilot RCT compare refine intervention usual care among adult recover HSCT . Semi-structured interview determine participant satisfaction acceptability intervention . Proposed outcome assessment also pilot , include patient-reported fatigue , depression , insomnia measure actigraphy assessment . The primary goal evaluate feasibility acceptability intervention . The exploratory goal conduct preliminary test efficacy intervention determine estimate variance effect size determination power sample size large trial .</detailed_description>
