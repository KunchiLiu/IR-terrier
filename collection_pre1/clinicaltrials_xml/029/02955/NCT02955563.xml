	<brief_title>CSDM : A Trial Improve Communication Shared Decision Making Using Web-Based Tool</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Roughly 600,000 Americans annually die shortly ICU admission , generally decision surrogates forego life support . Several decade research indicate : 1 . Family member ICUs often struggle role surrogate experience high rate last psychological sequela ( e.g . depression , anxiety , PTSD ) . For example , systematic review find one third surrogate long term feeling guilt doubt decision make . 2 . Patients often receive treatment inconsistent value preference . For example , SUPPORT trial , physicians frequently unaware patient ' wish regard end-of-life care , patient often die receive invasive treatment prefer . 3 . Intensive care near end life significant contributor health care cost . For example , medical care last year life account 25 % Medicare cost , ICU care contribute substantially . Breakdowns clinician-family communication ICUs common important target intervention . Using quantitative analysis audiorecorded goal care discussion ICUs , find 50 % conversation clinician inquire patient 's value treatment preference , similar proportion fail explicitly offer alternative indefinite life-prolonging treatment , time-limited trial comfort-focused treatment . We also document frequent omission important prognostic information conversation researcher document surrogate often hold unduly optimistic estimate patient ' prognosis . These data highlight importance improve quality collaborative decision make ICUs . This proposal responsive national research priority : The propose research address priority area national action Institute Medicine NIH : improve clinician-family communication end-of-life care patient advance organ system failure . It responsive call Institute Aging promote patient-centered decision make elderly patient . A critical barrier address problem absence scalable intervention . No empirically validate decision support tool exist range critical illness confront ICUs . Prior intervention address problem ( e.g. , proactive palliative care consultation add family support counselor ICU team ) face major barrier dissemination due project palliative care workforce shortage high cost add personnel ICU care team . Thus , develop pragmatic , scalable intervention overcome problem . We plan conduct pilot study among 100 surrogate clinician incapacitated patient assess efficacy intervention ( tool ) several aspect decision making . We hypothesize , compare usual care control , intervention group element share decision making audio record conversation ( H1 ) , surrogates accurate expectation patient 's prognosis ( H2 ) , great clarity patient 's value preference ( H3 ) , high perception preparation decision making ( H4 ) , assess use validated measure .</detailed_description>
