	<detailed_description>This Phase 2 , multi-center , double blind , placebo control study evaluate safety tolerability PBI-4050 , effect pancreatic , pulmonary function various biomarkers Cystic Fibrosis patient abnormal glucose tolerance . Patients abnormal glucose tolerance elevate glucose level either 1 hour 2 hour Oral Glucose Tolerance Test ( OGTT ) . A total 90 patient ( 30=INDENT , 30=IGT , 30=CFRD ) enrol study participation . A Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) continually review individual patient safety data obtain 90 patient . When first 30 patient complete least 1 month study treatment , DSMB meet formally determine whether additional patient may enrol , study continue change study stop . In addition , DSMB review PK data may recommend dose adjustment base PK result . The total duration study participation patient least 32 week , include 4 week screen period , 24 week study treatment 4 week safety follow-up . Patients choose participate extension study additional 24 week study treatment 4 week safety follow-up ( total 56 week ) .</detailed_description>
