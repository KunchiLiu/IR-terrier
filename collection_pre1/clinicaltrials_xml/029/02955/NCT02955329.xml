	<brief_title>E-cigarette THC Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Electronic cigarette ( e-cigarettes ) proliferate rapid rate since introduction US market 2007 use form nicotine delivery far outpace science base . Important question revolve around abuse liability safety . Although design device continue evolve , investigator previously describe nicotine intake , systemic retention , pharmacokinetics , effect , well vaping behavior self-administration e-cigarettes . The investigator show e-cigarettes deliver much nicotine 15 puff typical tobacco cigarette ( ~1 mg ) , systemically retain , shape plasma nicotine concentration-time curve also similar tobacco cigarette , except maximum plasma nicotine concentration , average , low e-cigarettes . During ad libitum access , e-cigarettes vaped intermittently group 2-5 puff single puff plasma nicotine level rise gradually peaked end 90-minute session . This differ rapid increase plasma nicotine observe control use e-cigarettes tobacco cigarette smoking . Taken together , result indicate e-cigarettes potential produce sustain nicotine addiction use abuse liability may differ tobacco cigarette . Marijuana widely use illicit drug . While marijuana traditionally combust , vaping either loose leaf marijuana form tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ) extract increase . The late national data show 7.6 % current marijuana user ( past 30 day ) 9.9 % ever marijuana user ( lifetime ) administer THC vaporizer electronic device ( study differentiate vaporizer electronic device like e-cigarettes ) . The prevalence vaped marijuana THC high among young adult . Prevalence vaped marijuana/THC among 18-24 25-34 year-old ever marijuana user 19.3 % 16.3 % , respectively , compare 8.8 % 35-49 year-olds 5.7 % 50 year ( 6 ) . A recent study also show high rate cannabis vaping use e-cigarettes among high school student ( 18.0 % among ever e-cigarette user ) . Although e-cigarettes design use THC extract , viscous nicotine e-liquids , abundance YouTube video demonstrate modify nicotine e-cigarettes use THC extract well prepare THC e-liquids . There also prepackaged cartridge THC extract compatible e-cigarette battery . Yet , science base keep grow use product . The investigator currently data THC delivery , pharmacokinetics , effect THC vaping currently market e-cigarettes . Further , tobacco mixed marijuana nicotinic reinforcement THC product blunts , inconceivable THC may also mixed nicotine e-liquids dilute THC extract . Therefore , important understand pharmacology safety simultaneous intake nicotine THC vaping . The study design within-subjects pharmacokinetic comparison . Fourteen ( 14 ) e-cigarette user also current marijuana/THC user switch two THC e-liquid condition , namely , ( ) e-liquid solution contain 40 % THC nicotine , ( b ) e-liquid solution contain 40 % THC 0.6 % ( 6 mg/mL ) nicotine , 2 outpatient visit . The outpatient day comprise fixed-puffing regimen . Study day separate least 48 hour . The order treatment ( THC THC nicotine ) counterbalance subject . Subjects blind content e-cigarette ( i.e . THC v THC + nicotine ) .</detailed_description>
