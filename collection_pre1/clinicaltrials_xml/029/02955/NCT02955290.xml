	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study best dose side effect CIMAvax vaccine nivolumab see well work treat patient stage III-IV non-small cell lung cancer . Vaccine therapy , CIMAvax vaccine may help slow stop tumor growth . Monoclonal antibody , nivolumab , may block protein need tumor cell grow spread . Giving CIMAvax vaccine together nivolumab may work well treat patient stage IIIB-IV non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CIMAvax Vaccine Nivolumab Treating Patients With Stage IIIB-IV Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : - To identify maximum dose CIMAvax combination nivolumab base dose limit toxicity ( DLTs ) assess Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events version 4.03 ( CTCAE v4.03 ) . ( Phase I ) - To examine effect dose dose interval ( start expansion phase cohort 2 ) antibody titer CIMAvax combine nivolumab second-line therapy advance non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . ( Phase I ) III . To evaluate 12-month overall survival CIMAvax combine nivolumab patient advance NSCLC . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : - To assess toxicity CIMAvax combine nivolumab use Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program ( CTEP ) National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE version 4.03 ) . ( Phase I ) - Determine preliminary efficacy study combination utilize immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( irRECIST ) guideline . ( Phase I ) EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES : - To conduct correlative study compare serum EGF level , platelet level , marker immune response functionality antibody response . ( Phase I ) - To examine association EGFR ( total activate ) , PD-1 PDL-1 expression mutation tumor tissue biomarkers genetic immune response . ( Phase I ) - Comparison response assessment criterion prospective analysis ( irRECIST response assessment ( 1 , 2 ) ( Appendix C ) vs. irRC ( 3 ) ( Appendix DAppendix D ) vs. RECIST 1.1 ( 4 ) ) . ( Phase I ) - To characterize blood EGF level blood-based biomarkers patient censor trial low titer response . ( Phase II ) - To examine association EGFR ( total activate ) , PD-1 PDL-1 expression mutation tumor tissue biomarkers genetic immune response . ( Phase II ) - Comparison response assessment criterion prospective analysis ( irRECIST response assessment ( 1 , 2 ) ( Appendix C ) vs. irRC ( 3 ) ( Appendix DAppendix D ) vs. RECIST 1.1 ( 4 ) ) . ( Phase II ) OUTLINE : This phase I dose escalation study CIMAvax follow phase II study . Patients receive CIMAvax vaccine intramuscularly ( IM ) nivolumab intravenously ( IV ) 60 minute day 1 . Courses nivolumab repeat every 2 week absence disease progression unexpected toxicity . Treatment CIMAvax vaccine repeat every 2 week . Within 4 week 4th dose , patient receive CIMAvax vaccine IM every 4 , 8 , 12 week 12 month absence disease progression unexpected toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 120 day .</detailed_description>
