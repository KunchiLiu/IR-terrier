	<brief_summary>The objective study look effect distractive auditory stimulus ( DAS ) reduce dyspnea intensity relate anxiety increase exercise tolerance . Investigators hope compare no-music control condition , music condition participant COPD ( ) demonstrate increase self-paced walk distance enjoyment ; ( b ) less dyspnea intensity , ( c ) experience less dyspnea anxiety ; ( ) less fatigue state anxiety ; ( e ) high maximum heart rate . The upbeat music tempo 90 - 100 bpm ( average-to-moderate walking tempo ) expect distractive performance enhance effect order increase tolerance dyspnea exercise . The long-term goal study increase physical activity adult COPD RLD promote dyspnea fatigue management use distractive auditory stimuli form music .</brief_summary>
