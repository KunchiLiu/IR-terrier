	<brief_summary>Hypothesis The use Macintosh blade size # 3.5 ( vs Macintosh size # 3 ) would reduce time require achieve successful tracheal intubation improve glottic view . Study objective The purpose research study compare 3 different laryngoscope blade ( size : 3.5 , 3.5 3 ) see blades size 3.5 reduce time require achieve successful tracheal intubation improve physician 's view glottis compare standard direct laryngoscope use blade size 3 , patient undergo lumbar surgery . Primary end point : time achieve successful tracheal intubation . Secondary end point : glottic view intubation , number intubation attempt effectiveness integrated suction Inscope Direct Laryngoscope .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Laryngoscopy common medical procedure use elective emergency intubation . The procedure perform either direct video laryngoscope device select dependent tool availability , provider ( i.e . anesthesiologist , emergency physician , ENT physician , paramedic , etc . ) preference , patient characteristic , intubation difficulty . The direct laryngoscope technique involve line-of-sight view patient 's mouth vocal cord along blade scope . The direct laryngoscopy technique old technique associate intubation . However , despite continuous improvement direct laryngoscope size shape since inception late 19th century , improvement yet address one major problem airway visualization : provider experience difficult intubation liquid ( i.e . gastric content , blood , mucus , etc . ) obstruct view . The Sun-Med GreenLine®/D™ Macintosh line disposable direct Macintosh laryngoscopes . It feature stainless steel blade polycarbonate light-pipe direct light airway . The handle , integrate battery LED light , blade separately package prior use . The GreenLine®/D™ Macintosh line available standard size ( 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ) new size build improve blade size many adult 3.5 Mac 3 short , Mac 4 large . The GreenLine®/D™ Macintosh feature integrate suction . The Inscope Direct Laryngoscope ( develop Inscope Medical Solutions ) new disposable direct laryngoscope two integrate controllable ( flow on/off ) suction pathway . By integrate controllable suction two independent pathway laryngoscope , provider able select primary ( blade tip ) suction pathway clear secretion ahead laryngoscope secondary ( blade mid-length , blade ) prevent clear fluid may re-accumulate procedure . Integrating suction device prevents common current practice `` juggling '' current suction catheter endotracheal ( breathe ) tube one hand hold patient 's airway open hand . While incidence aspiration fluid lung result poor airway fluid management low , outcomes associate complication poor . The Inscope Direct Laryngoscope develop Macintosh 3.5 size blade meet size requirement majority patient . This assumption back trend among disposable direct laryngoscope manufacturer toward 3.5 blade size , least 5 create 3.5 blade , include Teleflex , Sun-Med , Flexicare , Mercury Medical , Curaplex . This study compare Inscope Direct Laryngoscope ( blade size 3.5 ) currently use standard single-use Sun-Med Greenline/D Macintosh laryngoscopes DL-blade mac size Sun-Med Greenline/D-blade size 3.5 . All Direct Laryngoscopes consider Class I exempt device FDA . Because risk associate laryngoscope well know document , consider non-significant risk device study involve human .</detailed_description>
