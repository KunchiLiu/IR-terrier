	<brief_summary>This study find high acceptable treatment dose time infusion cord blood , culture expand natural killer ( NK ) cell , kind immune cell , patient multiple myeloma . The NK cell give vary day post autologous stem cell transplant . rhIL-2 administered treatment help NK cell expand body . The safety treatment study researcher want learn NK cell help treat multiple myeloma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Safety Study Human Cord Blood Derived , Culture-expanded , Natural Killer Cell ( PNK-007 ) Infusion With Subcutaneous Recombinant Human Interleukin-2 ( rhIL-2 ) Following Autologous Stem Cell Transplant Multiple Myeloma ( MM )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective study ass safety determine maximum tolerate dose PNK-007 well feasibility treat various timepoints follow ASCT subject multiple myeloma . The secondary objective explore potential clinical efficacy day 90-100 post ASCT . Treatment plan include ASCT follow PNK-007 administer IV Day 14 post ASCT determine maximum tolerate dose . Once IV Day 14 post ASCT . PNK-007 follow six rhIL-2 injection support NK cell expansion body . Subjects follow 12 month post PNK-007 .</detailed_description>
