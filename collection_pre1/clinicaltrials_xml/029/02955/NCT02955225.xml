	<brief_title>Using Pressure Detecting Insoles Reduce Knee Loading</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomized longitudinal proof-of-concept study . After telephone prescreening , in-person visit screen inclusion exclusion criterion , require clinical radiographic assessment . A total 40 subject symptomatic radiographic medial knee OA enrol study obtain informed consent . A total three study visit occur follow time point : baseline , 3 week , 6 week . At three visit , follow outcome variable acquire : ( 1 ) joint load gait use 3D motion analysis ( 2 ) knee symptom , stiffness , pain , daily function , recreational function , quality life use validated questionnaire . At baseline visit , every participant receive standardize shoe pressure-detecting shoe insole . Randomly assign one two group , participant assign group A ( n=25 ) train 3 week mobility shoe active pressure-based feedback shoe insole , group B ( n=15 ) train three week mobility shoe passive shoe insole . All subject encourage wear study shoe contain shoe insole primary form footwear minimum 6 hours/day , 6 days/week . They give diary record daily time spend wear shoe/insole , daily analgesic history , adverse event . These diary review 3 6 week study visit . After complete third visit , subject complete study .</detailed_description>
