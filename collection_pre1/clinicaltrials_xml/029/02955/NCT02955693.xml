	<brief_title>Study Effects Organism Monomethyl Fumarate ( MMF ) After Administration LAS41008</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The present study conduct investigate pharmacokinetics ( PK ) LAS41008 ( contain DMF ) single oral dose administration 120 mg gastro-resistant tablet feed fasting condition . Two previous Phase 1 study allow explore PK LAS41008 30 mg 120 mg separately multiple dosing . In current study , improve bioanalytical method allow detection lower MMF concentration , thus gastro-resistant tablet formulation ( LAS41008 ) use previous Phase 1 study investigate , large population single oral dose administration . Only high LAS41008 dose ( 120 mg ) test , formulation frequently use standard treatment course psoriasis LAS41008 . Similarly , single oral dos Fumaderm® 120 mg ( defined mixture DMF calcium ( Ca ) , magnesium ( Mg ) , zinc ( Zn ) salt ethylhydrogenfumarate ( EHF , mono-ethyl fumarate ( MEF ) ) test order provide well comparative PK data . The comparison LAS41008 Fumaderm® PK evaluate exploratory manner . The study conduct accord randomise , open-label , four-way complete crossover , single dose design 32 healthy male female subject . Up 4 discontinued subject may replace case early dropout dropout rate great 15 % ( 5 subject ) . Gender balance also take consideration ensure roughly number male female randomise . Upon inclusion treatment phase , subject randomly allocate one four treatment sequence 4x4 Williams design . On Day 1 treatment period subject receive single oral dose either LAS41008 120 mg gastro-resistant tablet Fumaderm® 120 mg gastro-resistant tablet fast feed condition . The drug administration separate wash-out-phase 7 ± 3 day . Blood sample PK perform 24 hour study drug administration . The Informed Consent Form ( ICF ) sign study activity , include withdrawal concomitant medication ( least 2 week screen visit ) require study participation . The Screening Visit take place within 28 day randomisation sign ICF check subject ' eligibility . In period , subject admit study centre morning Day -1 discharge morning Day 2 ( collection last blood sample PK ) . The duration study participation subject Visit 1 ( Screening ) Follow-up Visit 7 ± 3 day last study drug administration estimate approximately 7 10 week consider study visit time-window allowance .</detailed_description>
