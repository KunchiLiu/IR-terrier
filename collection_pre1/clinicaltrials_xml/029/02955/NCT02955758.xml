	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab Patients With Metastatic Non-squamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To correlate circulate tumor DNA ( ctDNA ) level measure use cancer personalize profile deep sequencing ( CAPP-Seq ) radiographic tumor assessment use Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) version ( v ) 1.1 criterion patient metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) treat pembrolizumab . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To correlate PD-L1 assessment pre-treatment tumor sample objective response use RECIST v1.1 criterion patient metastatic non-squamous NSCLC treat pembrolizumab . II . To determine overall response rate ( ORR ) use RECIST v1.1 criterion patient metastatic non-squamous NSCLC treat pembrolizumab . III . To determine progression-free survival ( PFS ) use RECIST v1.1 patient metastatic non-squamous NSCLC treat pembrolizumab . IV . To determine overall survival ( OS ) patient metastatic non-squamous NSCLC treat pembrolizumab . V. To determine safety tolerability pembrolizumab patient metastatic non-squamous NSCLC .</detailed_description>
