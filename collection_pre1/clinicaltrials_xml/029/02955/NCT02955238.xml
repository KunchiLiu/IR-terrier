	<brief_summary>The Latino population United States increase size ; diverse culture , background country origin ; experience unique influence social behavioral acculturation U.S. ; report nationally low rate heart disease ; report increase prevalence diabetes asthma ; generally poor less educate ( NHLBI work Group , 2003 ) . They represent important target population disparity research . In particular Latinos access care Community Health Centers United States represent ideal population conduct disparity research lack access care minimize various governmental health insurance support mechanism .

	<detailed_description>This study build exist relationship conduct propose study , use expertise epidemiologic , behavioral genetic research effort promote coordinate , comprehensive , interdisciplinary focus research effort improve care deliver indigent Latinos at-risk cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . This study consist three study visit : Study Visit 1 ( Sv1 ) : During Sv1 , last 2 hour , potential participant recruit consent process complete wish take part study . Participants blood pressure take blood draw take place . After blood draw participant give snack complete battery psychosocial , health history risk factor questionnaire . Lastly , stand height , weight bioelectric impedance ( Tanita scale ) measure determine BMI/obesity risk factor . At end Sv1 participant give GT3X actigraph objectively monitor physical activity . Participants ask wear activity monitor seven day ask return monitor Sv3 appointment . Chart Audit : A chart audit perform research assistant ( RA ) Sv3 order confirm eligibility confirm medical history . Information chart may also lead exclude individual deteriorate health status . If condition detect investigator consult primary care provider confirmation adjudication notify patient . Study Visit 2 ( Sv2 ) : The second study visit take place form telephone call . After Sv1 member research team call participant confirm eligibility continue interest randomize control trial . If participant still interested eligible , continue Sv3 . Study Visit 3 ( Sv3 ) : The final study visit randomization take place LUNA field site , B-mode ultrasound machine station . During time participant 1 ) Carotid Intimal Medial Thickness ( CIMT ) , primary outcome , measure use non-invasive ultrasonography , 2 ) difference blood pressure legs arm , call Ankle Brachial Index ( ABI ) , 3 ) complete outstanding/incomplete questionnaire Sv1 . During SV-3 informed consent review one time . The physical measure CIMT ABI perform trained technician . Also Sv3 , participant provide Medication Event Monitoring System ( MEMS ) track cap . These cap use objectively monitor participant adherence recommend chronic disease medication , either lipid lowering , hypertensive diabetes medication . In group provide study objective information medication use behavior intervention group information serve feedback improve adherence pill take behavior . Both control experimental condition ask participate medication adherence study component , begin immediately study group randomization . Participants ' medication adherence monitor one year include four prescription refill time point . In addition complete comprehensive baseline assessment SV-1 SV-3 , extend screening period allow participant time consider discuss participation study . If participant le one define CVD risk factor refuse participate RCT , offer participation observational study ( i.e . study base-line measure subsequent routine measure obtain usual care analyze ) . The observational group serve another comparison group overall chronic disease study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Hispanic/Latino ethnicity 2. register patient SYHC , Inc. 3. least 40 year age old 4. one modifiable CVD risk factor , define : high LDL cholesterol ( nondiabetic threshold = &gt; 160 mg/dl , diabetic threshold = &gt; 130 mg/dl ) , low HDL cholesterol ( &lt; 40 mg/dl ) , Obesity ( BMI &gt; 30 kg/m2 ) , Cigarette smoking ( daily smoker ) , Diabetes ( fast blood glucose &gt; 126 , selfreported and/or confirm chart review ) , Hypertension ( BP &gt; 140/90 mmHg , hypertensive med ) ; 5 ) currently participate CVD program . 1. pregnant ( temporary exclusionmay qualify six month post partum ) 2. plan move area next six month 3. health problem , disability , mental problem severe prohibit informed consent actual clinic/special intervention attendance . The common abnormality find ultrasound scan ( CIMT ) extensive carotid disease . For individual , may make examination carotid artery difficult . Thus , individual exclude 4 ) extensive carotid disease precludes accurate assessment CIMT .</criteria>
