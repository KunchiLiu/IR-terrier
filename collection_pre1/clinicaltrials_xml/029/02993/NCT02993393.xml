	<brief_title>A Comparative Study Between Simulation-based Problem-based Learning Difficult Airway Management Workshop</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction Currently , teacher emphasize instructional strategy enthusiasm critical thinking student understand educational course1 . As coach mentor , search innovative teaching model reach learn target 2 . In anesthesia , train program nurse student involve several teach method seminar , journal club well topic , didactic , simulation problem-based learn 13 , 14 . Simulation-based learning medicine utilizes aide manikin actor replicate clinical scenario . It yield acquisition skill deliberate practice rather apprentice style learn 22 . However , problem-based learn small group discussion student active , learner-centered , self-directed learning topic assignment . Teachers play role moderator facilitators 21 . Teaching learn airway management essential anesthetic field . The personnel need keen basic advance knowledge owe application benefit patient ' life . At present , diversity learn technique ( PBL SBL ) allow sophisticated device interactive learn tool cope difficulty detail . Nevertheless , neither PBL SBL manifest superior benefit instructional process learn content xx . Chin KL , et al . ( 2014 ) conclude simulation superior case-based learn teach diabetic ketoacidosis thyroid storm final-year , undergraduate pharmacy student . Randolph H , et al . ( 2006 ) reveal student learn critical assessment management skill use full-scale , high- fidelity simulation , perform good student acquire similar skill interactive problem-based learning format . As either PBL SBL difficult airway management base upon table specification experience instructor . We would like compare teacher ' student ' attitude two learn method . Objectives To compare PBL SBL term learn content , instructional evaluation method Material Methods After IRB approval No . 369/2558 ( EC3 ) . A prospective , questionnaires-based study perform amongst 40 volunteer , consent-signed nurse anesthetist student . The inclusion criterion teacher anesthesiologist involve SBL PBL 3 year experience teach . The inclusion criterion student nurse anesthetist student academic year 2015 . The exclusion criterion group one fit qualification . After stratified randomization , ten nurse anesthetist student attend either SBL PBL course one time . The one-day workshop perform simultaneously . Six week later , crossover technique apply group . At end project , teacher student response Likert 's scale questionnaire : 4 = suitable , 3 = suitable , 2 = unsuitable , 1 = unsuitable . The teacher ' questionnaire base table specification learn content , consist 4 part : airway evaluation ( history take physical examination ) , patient preparation ( equipment experience helper ) , 5 strategic planning ( facemask ventilation , supraglottic airway device , laryngoscopy , tracheal intubation fail intubation ) follow care ( documentation informative advice ) . On hand , student ' questionnaire comprise 3 part : learning content , process evaluation . The correctness appropriateness questionnaire ( content validity ) determine three board-certified anesthesiologist least ten year experience anesthesia involve project . The tryout perform ten novice nurse anesthetist five anesthesiologist student ' teacher ' matter respectively . The index item objective congruence 0.80 0.82 Cronbach 's Alpha 0.97 0.92 respectively . We use percentage , mean , standard deviation student t-Test data analysis significant level 0.05 95 % confident interval .</detailed_description>
