	<brief_summary>This open-label phase I/II study patient advance ( locally advance inoperable metastatic ) triple-negative breast cancer progress first-line therapy receive ixazomib day 1 , 8 , 15 combination carboplatin day 1 , 8 , 15 . Cycles repeat every four week .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The phase I part study use alternate dose escalation accelerate titration design . In accelerated dose-escalation phase single-patient cohort per dose level enrol , one dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) 2 moderate toxicity observe cycle 1 , dose level 4 reach . At dose level cohort expand three patient dose escalation revert conventional 3+3 escalation design . DLTs define inability deliver drug combination ixazomib carboplatin due drug relate toxicity . The maximum-administered dose ( MAD ) define dose DLT occur least two six patient treat dose level . The dose MAD consider maximum-tolerated dose ( MTD ) , provide DLT observe few two six treated patient ( few one third six patient treat ) dose level . Determination MAD MTD base DLT observe first treatment cycle . Phase II : After establish MTD phase I , accrual continue evaluate efficacy safety combination . A total 41 patient include ( patient enrol phase I part within conventional dose escalation phase dose level consider MTD may include ) . All subject continue study drug disease progression , unacceptable toxicity treatment discontinuation reason .</detailed_description>
