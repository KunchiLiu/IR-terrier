Submission tissue occur prior randomization . Where local center regulation prohibit submission block tumor tissue , two 2 mm core tumor block 520 unstained slide whole section representative tumor tissue prefer . Where possible obtain two 2 mm core tumor block , 520 unstained slide representative tumor tissue also acceptable . Where previously resect biopsied tumor tissue exist available , approval Sponsor/designated CRO , patient may still consider eligible study . 21 .
