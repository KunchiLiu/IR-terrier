	<brief_summary>The purpose study develop clinical database individual diagnose Krabbe disease order determine symptom herald onset clinical disease various phenotype Krabbe disease ; determine whether level GALC enzyme activity , specific genetic mutation predict clinical course ; determine neurodiagnostic test predict onset and/or severity disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purported incidence Krabbe disease 1/250,000 live birth . It believe 80-90 % affected child early-infantile form disease . Other forms disease , however , occur throughout life . Unfortunately neither enzyme activity level specific genetic mutation reliably predict phenotype . Since treatment Krabbe disease bone marrow transplantation , crucial able identify prognostic factor , accurately predict disease course . At time medical literature limit regard clinical sign symptom later-onset form Krabbe disease , well age onset , survival individual . Early-infantile Krabbe disease uniformly fatal outcome untreated , later-onset form remain at-risk developing symptom . The available treatment , pool cord-blood transplantation , 10-20 % mortality rate . The vast majority child screen positively Krabbe disease newborn screen uncertain prognosis . No single diagnostic test available currently accurately predict onset symptom . Consequently , improve phenotypic understand enhance diagnostic paradigm Krabbe disease , facilitate timely diagnosis treatment . The information collect registry use improve accuracy diagnosis , prevent child destine develop Krabbe subject unnecessarily treatment . The hypothesis test include : - detailed database broaden phenotypic understand Krabbe disease ; - new therapy result good phenotypic understanding disorder . A questionnaire collect time enrollment information pertain individual affected Krabbe disease . Clinical information collect include : age onset symptom ; type symptom ; age diagnosis ; level GALC enzyme activity ; identification specific genetic mutation ; result available brain MRI imaging evaluation ; result available spinal fluid protein analyse ; result available brainstem auditory evoke response evaluation ; result available visual evoke response evaluation ; result available nerve-conduction-velocity study . If possible , CD-ROMs contain image data physician report brain MRI imaging evaluation obtain . Potential prognostic indicator base molecular genetic result , GALC enzyme level , detect potential biomarkers , neurodiagnostic test analyze . Information status participant 's general health , disease progression , impact disease , neurologic symptom , developmental milestone collect follow-up phone call parent caregiver . After de-identification , data enter Krabbe clinical database University Buffalo 's Center Excellence Bioinformatics , and/or Population Health Observatory South Campus , and/or Longitudinal Pediatric Data Resource , tool provide Newborn Screening Translational Research Network .</detailed_description>
