	<brief_title>Effect Robot-assisted Gait Training Gait Automaticity Patients With Parkinson 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Parkinson 's disease disease cause dopamine deficiency striatum result loss dopaminergic neuronal cell cerebral substantia . It progressive neurodegenerative disease characterize motor symptom include gait disturbance balance instability . In early stage Parkinson 's disease , dysfunction sensorimotor area basal ganglia typically occur , lead habitual control hurdle . Accordingly , cognitive effort require perform habitual task walk , automaticity walking reduce . Walking performance dual-task condition use assess gait automaticity patient Parkinson 's disease . Robot-assisted gait training method rehabilitation repeat normal gait pattern high intensity . Recent meta-analysis show robot-assisted gait training improved recovery independent gait stroke compare conventional rehabilitation therapy . On hand , robot-assisted gait training Parkinson 's disease report improve walk speed walk endurance compare conventional physical therapy , superior treadmill exercise intensity . In addition , report patient Parkinson 's disease balance impairment , robot-assisted gait training improve balance disorder compare physical therapy , gait freeze improve small-scale patient . However , study effectiveness robot-assisted gait training Parkinson 's disease still lack , mechanism effect elucidate . In particular , effect gait automaticity , characteristic Parkinson 's disease , study . Therefore , pilot study aim investigate whether robot-assisted gait training apply improve walk autonomy patient Parkinson 's disease .</detailed_description>
