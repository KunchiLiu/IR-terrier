	<brief_summary>Acute Myeloid Leukaemia ( AML ) aggressive rare cancer myeloid cell ( white blood cell responsible fight infection ) . Successful treatment AML dependent subtype AML patient , age patient diagnose . Venetoclax experimental drug kill cancer cell block protein ( part cell ) allow cancer cell stay alive . This study design see add venetoclax azacitidine work well azacitidine . This Phase 3 , randomize , double-blind ( treatment unknown patient doctor ) study patient AML 60 year old treat . Patients take part study suitable standard induction therapy ( usual start treatment ) . AbbVie funding study take place approximately 150 hospital globally enrol approximately 400 patient . In study , 2/3 patient receive venetoclax every day azacitidine remain 1/3 receive placebo ( dummy ) tablets azacitidine . Patients continue study visit receive treatment long clinical benefit . The effect treatment AML check take blood , bone marrow , scan , measure side effect complete health questionnaire . Blood bone marrow test complete see people respond good others . Additional blood test complete genetic factor see long drug remain body .</brief_summary>
