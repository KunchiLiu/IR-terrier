	<brief_summary>The North American Scapula Consortium ( NASCon ) multi-center injury specific outcome registry . There currently exist paucity outcome data literature patient population . The NASCon registry resource investigator conduct adequately powered clinical outcome research result high quality research meaningful result , improved patient care , evidence-based advancement treatment scapula fracture . Registries lead significant discovery comparative effectiveness specifically area randomize control study possible . Collecting post-treatment ( operative non-operative ) patient outcome data similar injury pattern show effective uncover optimal standard treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Number Subjects : Estimated Year 1 10 Sites 80 Subjects Enrolled Year 2 13 Sites 130 Subjects Enrolled Year 3 16 Sites 170 Subjects Enrolled Year 4 go 200 Subjects per year The North American Scapula Consortium , NASCon multi center injury specific outcome registry . Patients present participate surgeon Extra Articular and/or Intra Articular scapula fracture meeting inclusion criterion ask signed consent participate outcome registry regardless treatment plan ( operative non-operative ) . Justification state number subject : The goal study capture many patient meet inclusion criterion enrol site possible . The investigator estimate 10 13 patient per site , per year . Participating site : Participating site identify base experience expertise scapula repair , interest research , desire advance knowledge continue education area . Initially , Dr. Peter Cole personally invite new site . Future site recruitment approve Dr. Peter Cole select board . Sites must necessary research infrastructure willing able follow rule regulation associate Human Research requirement . They require submit evidence site IRB approval prior initiation . Data Collection : Time point : Day 0 Activity : obtain patient consent , x-rays , chart review , data pull electronic medical record Activity conduct : study coordinator participate NASCon site Time point : 6 wks , 3 mo , 6 mo , 12 mo , 24 mo Activity : patient questionnaire , Range Motion , Strength , x-ray The following list demographic treatment variable collect patient 's initial enrollment visit well patient 's EMR : Demographics : Gender , date birth , dominant hand Injury : Inclusion indication , radiographic image , date injury , mechanism injury , side scapular injury , ipsilateral UE fracture , SSSC lesion , system injury , Ada &amp; AO/OTA Classifications , prior treatment , workman 's compensation status . Surgical Data ( applicable ) : Date surgery , operative time , estimate blood loss , procedure , subsequent shoulder procedure require , scapula operative approach , type implant . The following list outcome variable collect follow-up clinic visit well patient 's EMR : General Information : Physical Therapy , activity level , return work , pain/pain medication , complication , subsequent procedure , radiographic image . Range Motion : A 14 inch goniometer use evaluate flexion , abduction , external rotation , internal rotation injure contralateral shoulder . Strength : A handheld dynamometer ( MicroFET 2 , Hoggan Health Industries , Draper , Utah ) , previously publish reliable technique10 , assess strength shoulder flexion , abduction , external rotation injure contralateral shoulder . Disabilities Arm , Shoulder , Hand questionnaire ( DASH ) . 11 The DASH develop measure physical disability symptom upper extremity people upper extremity disorder ( hand , wrist , elbow , shoulder ) . It 30-item scale address difficulty perform various physical activity require upper extremity function , stiffness , impact disability symptom social activity , work , sleep , psychological well-being . The score range 0 100 , 0 equivalent disability 100 equivalent severe disability . The DASH validate instrument establish normative minimal clinically important difference . SF-12v2 The SF-12v2 multipurpose , short-form health survey 12 question . The SF-12v2 develop 1994 The Health Institute shorten version SF-36 health survey . It yield eight-scale profile score well physical mental health summary measure . The eight scale include : physical functioning , role physical functioning , mental functioning , role mental functioning , social function , bodily pain , vitality , general health . It generic measure , oppose one target specific age , disease , treatment group . Reporting Results : Demographic data , treatment detail , outcome variable summarize frequency proportion , categorical , measure central tendency ( e.g. , mean , median ) dispersion ( e.g . standard deviation , quartile ) continuous . Quarterly registry report include enrollment rate , follow-up capture rate , descriptive summary demographic , surgical outcome data well description safety event membership sponsor make aware . Reports share membership study sponsor minimum annual basis . Publication presentation outcomes expect peer-reviewed orthopaedic journal symposium , substantial data collection outcome ≥1 year post-injury accomplish . Additionally , opportunity describe establishment injury specific consortium registry , include experience , process tool utilize development registry , may pursue membership .</detailed_description>
