	<brief_title>Transurethral En Bloc Versus Standard Resection Bladder Tumour</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bladder cancer 9th commonly diagnosed cancer men worldwide , standardized incidence rate 9.0 per 100,000 person-years men 2.2 per 100,000 person-years woman . In Hong Kong , 400 new case bladder cancer diagnose every year . It common important disease carry significant burden health medical system . For patient diagnosed bladder tumour upon flexible cystoscopy , transurethral resection bladder tumour ( TURBT ) offer . Being minimally invasive procedure , become standard initial management bladder cancer . This operation aim ascertain diagnosis , correctly stage tumour ( T-stage ) cure disease case non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer ( NMIBC ) . However , combine analysis 2,596 patent 7 randomise control trial patient NMIBC , show 1-year recurrence rate range 15-61 % , 5-year recurrence rate range 31-78 % . Despite possible complete tumour resection TURBT , oncological control NMIBC far satisfactory . There two main problem conventional standard resection ( SR ) procedure . First , bladder tumour resect piecemeal manner . This result tumour fragmentation float tumour cell inside bladder . The tumour cell may re-implant bladder wall lead early disease recurrence . Second , 'complete tumour resection ' often determine endoscopic vision . Due inherit nature piecemeal resection , possible ass resection margin histological mean . The char effect resection bed may also hinder judgement 'complete tumour resection ' . Routine second-look TURBT advocate select patient ( Any presence T1 disease , G3 disease , absence detrusor muscle first TURBT specimen ) even 'complete tumour resection ' first TURBT . Second-look TURBT show detect residual disease 33-55 % patient upstaging disease 4-45 % patient . These result highlight limitation TURBT ascertain complete tumour resection . Transurethral en bloc resection ( EBR ) describe alternate surgical technique bladder tumour resection . By prevent tumour fragmentation ascertain complete tumour resection histological assessment EBR specimen , hypothesize EBR could reduce disease recurrence compare SR .</detailed_description>
