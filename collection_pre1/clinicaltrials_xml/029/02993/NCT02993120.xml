	<detailed_description>This prospective multicenter observational cohort study retrospective component/chart review ASCVD subject design describe practice pattern cholesterol management subject US . Up 1 year retrospective lipid treatment , lipid measurement pattern , CV data subject ASCVD meeting inclusion/exclusion criterion enrol clinical site capture . The retrospective data collection perform following reason : - Capture relevant factor relate subject 's CV risk pertinent medical history . - Capture change LLT time relate subject 's clinical condition medical history adverse event LLT Eligible subject invite enroll chronological order attend clinic . The study enroll 3 subject cohort follow rationale : 1 ) first cohort consist approximately 500 subject PCSK9i time enrollment . The goal include large enough cohort patient receive PCSK9i real world clinical practice ; allow ( first time ) good understand characteristic patient whose treatment escalate include PCSK9i , therapeutic effect PCSK9i outside randomize clinical trial setting , prolonged duration follow ; 2 ) second cohort enroll approximately 2000 subject LDL-C level . 100 mg/dL . The purpose include large group patient establish ASCVD suboptimal LDL control . - To good understand treatment pattern rate CV event group ; 3 ) third group enroll approximately 2500 subject LDL-C level 70 99 mg/dL . The purpose include large group patient establish ASCVD optimal control LDL . - To good understand patient characteristic , lipid-lowering treatment management , rate CV event , potential opportunity LLT optimization group . Interactive voice response system use track number subject cohort . Once cohort fill , subject may enrol . After first subject enrol annually thereafter , physician fill questionnaire general use LLT type dose overall goal lipid management . The study specific data collection point align standard care physician schedule visit . Each subject follow systematic series medical chart review conduct participate clinical site . Initial chart review occur subject enrollment subsequent scan chart occur site every 6 month thereafter . In addition , questionnaire administer subject every 6 month via CATI system ( wherein interviewer ask subject series standard question ) determine general perception attitude towards LLT . The order question questionnaire base subject response . This facilitate report number inpatient visit , outpatient visit , outpatient procedure , diagnostic test , prescription nonprescription medication use prior 6 month . Subjects ask complete questionnaire even routinely see enrol physician switch provider .</detailed_description>
