	<brief_summary>This research do evaluate multimodality imaging , include magnetic resonance imaging-guided therapy ( MRT ) , possible treatment gynecologic cancer . The therapy take place Department Radiation Oncology Johns Hopkins SKCCC . The purpose study investigate ability MRI successfully guide placement brachytherapy applicator necessary treat participant ' gynecologic cancer . The Investigators want see use MRI well job assess tumor time brachytherapy routinely use CT scan . The Investigators also want determine use MRI enable doctor reduce radiation dose receive body process treat tumor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The goal trial ass magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) may use improve tumor normal tissue volume delineation , reduce toxicity recurrence gynecologic brachytherapy . To analyze correlation T2 diffusion weight MR-imaging characteristic pathologically determine marker proliferation , Investigators biopsy tissue time brachytherapy . The Investigators compare dosimetric value organ risk ( OAR ) CT versus MRI planning . The Investigators anticipate MR-planned case low OAR dose standard CT-based case due conformal planning . The Investigators determine dose threshold radiation-related toxicity treatment . The Investigators compare toxicity rate 6 month , 1 2 year treatment , thereby enable improve recommendation dose limit OAR .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must histologically cytologically confirm carcinoma . Central pathology review require ; however , pathology review SKCCC Johns Hopkins . Site/Stage Any patient eligible internal implantation without MR guidance consider eligible protocol . Standard criteria internal implantation include : Carcinoma cervix : Stage IIVA vaginal recurrence Carcinoma uterus : Stage IIIB ( vaginal involvement ) , inoperable , vaginal recurrence Carcinoma vagina : Stage IIVA vaginal recurrence Carcinoma vulva : Stage IIVA recurrence Carcinoma urethra base treat physician 's discretion Patients receive prior radiation chemotherapy may enrol study . Age &gt; 18 year . Children develop malignancy therefore consider candidate trial . Life expectancy great 6 month . ECOG performance status &lt; 2 great , base treat physician 's discretion MRI pelvis PETCT within 4 month registration Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement .
