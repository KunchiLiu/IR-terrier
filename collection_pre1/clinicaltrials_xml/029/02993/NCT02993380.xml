	<brief_summary>Patients chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) high mortality rate general population . Especially , common cause mortality know cardiovascular disease account almost 50 percent patient dialysis . Mediterranean diet report lower risk coronary artery disease general population . Mediterranean diet acceptable CKD patient restriction potassium , phosphorus , protein . Relatively proper food among Mediterranean diet hemodialysis patient olive oil . Many researcher usually prefer olive oil control group evaluate effect omega-3 fatty acid . However , previous study report control group use olive oil 3g day show increased component omega-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) . Therefore , cardioprotective effect olive oil may associate increase omega-3 fatty acid level .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Olive Oil Erythrocyte Membrane Fatty Acid Contents Hemodialysis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fatty acid content erythrocyte membrane biomarker reveals status fatty acid within recent 3 month . Omega-3 fatty acid EPA DHA , omega-3 index calculate sum EPA DHA , ratio EPA/arachidonic aicd ( AA ) frequently report important biomarkers association cardiovascular accident . One fatty acid content erythrocyte membrane , oleic acid increase patient acute coronary disease compare control group . Oleic acid erythrocyte membrane hemodialysis patient take omega-3 significantly decrease compare group take olive oil . In addition , control group use olive oil also meaningfully decrease erythrocyte membrane oleic acid compare baseline level . In way , olive oil seem similar effect omega-3 fatty acid . supplement enough amount olive oil balance meal may show similar effect omega-3 fatty acid supplementation . It ideal way intake olive oil uncooked state vegetable bread , practically people stir-fry fry food olive oil instead cook oil . Ignition point olive oil 185-205 degree Celsius depend oxidation degree . There study content vitamin C broccoli scantly change broccoli stir-fried olive oil . It need identify change erythrocyte membrane content take uncooked natural olive oil take fry stir fried olive oil food . Taking meal olive oil change erythrocyte membrane fatty acid content include oleic acid hemodialysis patient .</detailed_description>
