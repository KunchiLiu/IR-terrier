	<detailed_description>This phase 3 , randomize , double-blind , interventional study nDC vaccination versus placebo . Dendritic cell-based immunotherapy consist antigen-loaded autologous DC administer patient intention induce antigen-specific T B cell response prove safe minimal side effect . Natural DC ( nDC ) consist plasmacytoid DC myeloid DC . Subjects randomize 2:1 stratified stage disease , adjuvant radiotherapy , BRAF mutation status , HLA-type nDC production centre .
