	<brief_summary>The aim study assess safety immunogenicity CYD dengue vaccine administer concomitantly sequentially Gardasil® ( Human Papillomavirus Quadrivalent [ Types 6 , 11 , 16 , 18 ] Vaccine , Recombinant ) . Primary objective : - To demonstrate humoral immune response ( term geometric mean titer [ GMTs ] ) Gardasil concomitant administration non-inferior sequential administration CYD dengue vaccine measure 28 day last dose Gardasil . - To demonstrate humoral immune response CYD dengue vaccine concomitant administration non-inferior sequential administration Gardasil measure 28 day last dose CYD dengue vaccine . Secondary Objectives : - To demonstrate humoral immune response ( term seroconversion ) Gardasil concomitant administration non-inferior sequential administration CYD dengue vaccine measure 28 day last dose Gardasil - To describe humoral immune response Gardasil baseline dose Gardasil group - To describe humoral immune response CYD dengue vaccine baseline dose CYD dengue vaccine group - To describe safety Gardasil CYD dengue vaccine dose group .</brief_summary>
