	<brief_summary>One major challenge face researcher work field rehabilitation science ability provide integrative approach use clinical practice . In context becomes increasingly necessary construct investigative approach , reach clinical practice short period time , since large volume information produce globally impact short medium term new therapeutic recommendation . Among various chronic painful entity , chikungunya fever highlight rich clinical chronology relation pain . Its therapy use do drug almost national international consensus , therefore therapy pain chikungunya fever limit rehabilitation process . It important science rehabilitation enhance method noninvasive brain modulation enable , excitation inhibition specific cortical area produce pain inhibiting effect , provide simple low cost treatment clinical routine.Technological advance non-invasive technique modulate brain function develop , instance , Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation ( tDCS ) . The objective present project present tDCS new modality physical rehabilitation patient chronic pain result chikungunya fever . The purpose study present physical , behavioral social result application tDCS chikungunya fever , suggest improvement quality life functional status individual .</brief_summary>
