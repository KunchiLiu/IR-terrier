	<brief_title>Ropidoxuridine Whole Brain Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Brain Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To conduct phase 1 dose escalation trial patient brain metastasis determine maximum tolerate dose maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) ropidoxuridine ( 5-iodo-2-pyrimidinone-2'-deoxyribose [ IPdR ] ) administer alone orally daily 7 consecutive day concurrently conventionally fractionated whole brain radiation therapy ( WBRT ) 21 day . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To observe record anti-tumor activity IPdR-mediated radiosensitization . II . To estimate intracranial progression-free survival ( PFS ) brain metastasis cancer patient receive daily oral IPdR x 28 day WBRT . III . To establish pharmacokinetics daily oral dosing IPdR time 8 day . IV . To evaluate safety tolerability oral IPdR x 28 day WBRT . V. To estimate incidence delay neurological toxicity 8 , 16 , 24 32 week ( +/-1 week ) post-completion WBRT include delayed-recall Hopkins Verbal Learning Test revise ( HVLT-R ) . VI . To estimate incidence delay neurological toxicity 8 , 16 , 24 32 week ( +/-1 week ) post-completion WBRT include delayed-recall Hopkins Verbal Learning Test Revised ( HVLT-R ) quality life measure Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy-Brain ( FACT-BR ) . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess , patient treat maximally tolerate dose ( MTD ) , biochemical evidence IPdR effect normal tissue ( circulate granulocyte ) measure % IUdR-deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) cellular incorporation flow cytometry high-pressure liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) analyse exploratory biomarker % IUdR-DNA tumor cell incorporation day 8 extracranial tumor biopsy brain metastasis cancer patient receive MTD dos IPdR exploratory biomarker tumor radiosensitization use Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criterion . II . To assess , patient treat maximally tolerate dose ( MTD ) , biochemical evidence IPdR effect normal tissue ( circulate granulocyte ) measure % IUdR-deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) cellular incorporation flow cytometry high-pressure liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) analyse exploratory biomarker % IUdR-DNA cellular incorporation patient ' circulate granulocyte take weekly 28-day IPdR MTD dose , day 29 , week 8 exploratory biomarker IPdR systemic toxicity bone marrow measure serial complete blood count ( CBC ) /differential value . OUTLINE : This dose escalation study ropidoxuridine . Patients receive ropidoxuridine orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 undergo whole brain radiotherapy day 8-12 , 15-19 , 22-26 . After completion study treatment , patient follow 8 , 16 , 24 week .</detailed_description>
