	<detailed_description>Background : Traumatic brain injury ( TBI , `` head injury ) major cause morbidity mortality worldwide ( Hyder et al. , 2007 ) . During first four decade life , trauma lead cause death TBI involve least half number case ( Jennett , 1996 ) . In UK , 1,500 per 100,000 population ( total 1 million ) attend Accident Emergency Departments head injury per year . Of , around 135,000 people admitted year estimate 500,000 people ( age 16 - 74 ) long term disability direct result TBI ( Headway , 2016 ) . Approximately 10 per 100,000 per year die head injury ( Jennett MacMillan , 1981 , Hutchinson et al. , 1998 ) . The major determinant outcome TBI severity primary injury , irreversible . However , primary injury invariably lead activation cellular molecular cascade mediate secondary injury evolve ensue hour day ( Masel DeWitt , 2010 ) therefore amenable therapeutic intervention . These molecular cascade lead brain swell within confines fix intracranial compartment , lead increase intracranial pressure ( ICP ) compromise cerebral perfusion pressure ( CPP ) ( Werner Engelhard , 2007 ) . The control ICP maintenance CPP bedrock neurointensive care management TBI several decade , however , recent multicenter randomise clinical trial could show long-term favorable outcome ICP guide therapy ( Carney et al. , 2012 ) . The Neuro Critical Care Unit ( NCCU ) Cambridge world leader TBI monitoring routinely employ multi-modal monitoring comprise ICP , brain tissue oxygen microdialysis monitoring , every TBI patient . Conceptually , microdialysis monitoring attractive method assess tissue biochemistry provide direct measure metabolic substrates cellular level energy failure occur . Specifically , microdialysis derive measure Lactate/Pyruvate Ratio ( LPR ) measure cellular redox state therefore balance aerobic anaerobic metabolism . To date , study literature focus demonstrate individual monitoring parameter e.g . microdialysis derive LPR &gt; 25 correlate unfavorable outcome multivariate analysis ( Sarrafzadeh et al. , 2000 , Timofeev et al. , 2011 ) . One reason ICP monitoring trial proven deliver improve outcome several alternative route neuronal injury include insufficient oxygen delivery ( Nortje Gupta , 2006 ) , diffusion barrier within tissue ( Smielewski et al. , 2002 ) , tissue hypoglycaemia ( Vespa et al. , 2003 ) mitochondrial dysfunction ( Verweij et al. , 2000 ) . Our understanding pathophysiological mechanism greatly advanced use multi-modality monitoring include direct measurement brain tissue oxygen cerebral microdialysis . In theory , pathophysiological state could treat use treatment ICP lower therapy , augment cerebral perfusion pressure ( CPP ) , increase oxygen delivery augment glucose delivery . Though , currently n't know best way combine treatment often use together make independent analysis difficult . Moreover , currently approve therapy mitochondrial dysfunction , claim mitochondrial dysfunction imminent increase LPR ( Nordstrom et al. , 2016 ) , reality complex condition treatable increase LPR , state need good establish clinician order accurately guide treatment ( Lazaridis Robertson , 2016 ) . Previous implementation guideline TBI show improve care reduce health relate cost , something hope achieve establish clinical protocol ( Faul et al. , 2007 ) . Overall research design We propose treatment algorithm explore standardise clinical protocol incorporate multi-modality monitoring parameter ( intracranial pressure , brain tissue oxygen microdialysis parameter ) systematically rigorously apply traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) patient cohort derange brain chemistry ( LPR &gt; 25 ) . Our principal outcome metric ability protocol improve LPR , well see many patient may stratify suggest treatment category ( see ) . Interventions assessment Following inclusion , patient monitor use standard clinical monitoring sedate ventilated TBI patient include Intracranial Pressure ( ICP ) monitor device , brain tissue oxygen monitor ( PbO2 ) microdialysis ass brain biochemistry ( Le Roux et al. , 2014 , Hutchinson et al. , 2015 ) . While ICP PbO2 measure continually , microdialysis sample measure hourly . If derangement LPR identify ( LPR &gt; 25 ) , patient increase monitoring frequency every 30 minute . Our primary measure derange energy generation cellular level LPR &gt; 25 . This threshold show relate unfavourable long-term outcome ( Timofeev et al. , 2011 , Stein et al. , 2012 ) . If LPR &gt; 25 two consecutive sample ( avoid spurious transient derangement ) trigger specific treatment strategy depend contemporaneous monitoring modality . After intervention , two consecutive microdialysis sample take confirm whether LPR correct whether step protocol need take . The sequence intervention choose basis strength association intervention LPR exist literature ( Hutchinson et al. , 2015 ) . STAGE 1 : Correction Intracranial Hypertension ; ICP correct &lt; 20mmHg Raised ICP compromise delivery substrate oxygen injure brain , reduce Cerebral Perfusion Pressure ) independent predictor poor outcome ( Marmarou et al. , 1991 , Bratton et al. , 2007b ) . In acute setting use hypertonic saline ( 100ml 5 % saline central venous bolus ) rapid mean reduce ICP ( Marko , 2012 ) . This follow escalation ICP control measure use establish ICP protocol ( Helmy et al. , 2007 ) . STAGE 2 : Ensure sufficient Oxygenation ; increase PbO2 &gt; 15mmHg Increased LPR reflect ischaemia first instance ensure adequate oxygenation increase PbO2 &gt; 15mmHg . This threshold PbO2 recognise physiological literature ( van den Brink et al. , 2000 ) . There two possible limitation oxygen availability brain tissue recognise TBI : 1 . Inadequate oxygen delivery ( DO2 ( brain ) =Cerebral Blood Flow ( CBF ) x Oxygen Capacity Blood ) Firstly , ensure adequate haemoglobin concentration ( &gt; 8g/dl ) within blood normovolemia ensure adequate oxygen carry capacity . Cerebral perfusion pressure ( CPP ) monitor surrogate CBF usually maintain around 60-80 mmHg use vasopressor NCCU . The CPP target base autoregulatory parameter individual patient utilise ICM+ software . The pressure reactivity index ( PRx ) , measure ability cerebral vasculature autoregulate differ CPP ( Czosnyka et al. , 1997 ) . Keeping patient 's CPP autoregulatory range show observational study improve outcome ( Aries et al. , 2012 , Needham et al. , 2016 ) . If PRx &gt; 0.3 , increase CPP 10-20 mmHg ( maximum 80mmHg per upper threshold suggest BTF guideline ) ( Bratton et al. , 2007a ) . 2 . Diffusion Barrier Even adequate oxygen delivery , microcirculatory collapse capillary level lead tissue hypoxia ( Menon et al. , 2004 ) . In circumstance , increase partial pressure oxygen arterial blood ( PaO2 ) increase gradient oxygen within blood brain tissue drive oxygen tissue ( Reinert et al. , 2003 ) . This achieve increase fractional inspire oxygen ( FiO2 ) 40 % maximum FiO2 80 % . STAGE 3 : Ensure adequate metabolic substrate delivery ; increase brain glucose &gt; 1.0 mmol/L Glucose primary biochemical substrate order generate pyruvate glycolysis . Brain tissue hypoglycaemia , measure use microdialysis , show common follow TBI , correlate unfavourable outcome ( Stein et al. , 2012 ) . If brain tissue glucose level fall &lt; 1.0 mmol/L , increase plasma glucose 7-10 mmol/L , low level show correlate brain tissue hypoglacemia ( Oddo et al. , 2008 ) , use 50 % dextrose . Glucose manipulation previously demonstrate improve LPR ( Oddo et al. , 2008 ) . STAGE 4 : Persistent LPR &gt; 25 despite monitor modality normalize ; consider mitochondrial dysfunction The mitochondrion site oxidative phosphorylation within cell generate Adenine-Tri-Phosphate ( ATP ) presence oxygen suitable biochemical substrate ( typically pyruvate ) tricarboxylic acid ( TCA ) cycle . It empirically demonstrate follow TBI , even presence adequate oxygenation glucose mitochondrion incapable utilising substrate energy generation ( Verweij et al. , 2000 ) . In circumstance , limited amount ATP generate anaerobic pathway generate lactate byproduct , thus increase LPR . In case , LP ratio increase , normal pyruvate concentration ( &gt; 70mmol/l ) . In circumstance accept pharmacological therapy although literature succinate , component tricarboxcylic acid cycle ( Ehinger et al. , 2016 ) , Cyclosporin A , calcineurin inhibitor , ( Mbye et al. , 2009 ) show potential efficacy mitochondrial dysfunction , Cyclosporin A proven safety profile TBI patient ( Mazzeo et al. , 2009 ) . It treat physician decide wish consider novel neuroprotective agent metabolic substrate show promising result treatment mitochondrial dysfunction . Sampling strategy data collection Multimodality monitoring parameter collect neuro-critical care unit ( NCCU ) real time , include ICP , CPP ( PRx ) PbO2 well potential treatment provide . Microdialysis parameter , include brain metabolite glucose , pyruvate , lactate , glycerol glutamate , sample every 30 minute research nurse NCCU . When intracranial monitoring deem necessary anymore , discontinue per conventional management . The number intervention patient receives deviation protocol record .</detailed_description>
