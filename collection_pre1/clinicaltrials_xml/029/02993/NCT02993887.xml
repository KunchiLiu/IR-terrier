	<brief_summary>The investigator conduct randomize clinical trial pilot study examine effectiveness theoretically base intervention ( call ReMind ) encompass two key component : ( ) Resourcefulness Training parent caregiver , ( b ) daily mindfulness meditation deliver use smart phone application ( Stop , Breathe &amp; Think™ ) intervention ( Mind Only ) consist daily mindfulness meditation . Both component intervention test separately ( combine ) intervention self-tailored , meet vital need caregiver engage self-management activity convenient . The investigator test two arm intervention 30 parent technology-dependent child , 15 parent group . The investigator collect mixed data baseline , 3 month 6 month subject enrollment describe change proximal distal outcome . The investigator aim : 1 . Evaluate intermediate ( 3 month ) long-term ( 6 month ) effect ReMind Mind Only intervention study mediator ( HPA Axis Function stress , cognitive factor , resourcefulness ) determine different effect ReMind Mind Only intervention . 2 . Evaluate difference distal psychological ( Mental Health Related Quality Life , Depressive Cognitions , Depressive Symptoms , Anxiety , Caregiver Burden ) , physical ( Physical Health Related Quality Life ) , cost outcome subject ReMind Mind Only arm time . 3 . Determine moderate effect parent ' social support , demographic ( age , gender , family income ) child 's functional status ( ) proximal outcome relationship ( ) intervention arm distal outcome , ( b ) HPA Axis Function , stress , cognitive factor distal outcome . 4 . Evaluate impact decentering association intervention proximal distal outcome . 5 . Explore difference neurological processing ( DMN TPN ) decentering proximal distal outcome associate intervention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Design Overview . The investigator conduct two-arm Randomized Clinical Trial compare effect ReMind Mind intervention psychological physical health outcome cognitive task switch DMN TPN neural network Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( fMRI ) Diffusion Tensor Imaging ( DTI ) . The full ReMind intervention involve daily self-tailored mindful meditation application focus kindness compassion 4 week self-selected frequency use thereafter . The application use theoretically construct test delivered smart phone app free ( iPad , computer well ) . ReMind also include five resourcefulness training aspect : 1 ) one face-to-face session teach social ( help-seeking ) personal ( self-help ) resourcefulness skill , 2 ) ongoing web access video vignettes parent technology-dependent child describe application resourcefulness skill daily life , 3 ) 4 week skill ' reinforcement use daily journal writing parent , 4 ) weekly phone call intervention nurse 4 week face-to-face intervention training . The Mind Only intervention include meditation component . Thus , investigator able see addition Resourcefulness Training significantly impact proximal outcome ( self management behavior ) appraise sleep quality , positive health practice distal outcomes psychological health ( Mental Health Related Quality Life , depressive cognition , anxiety , caregiver burden ) , physical health ( Physical Health Related Quality Life ) , economic cost . Sample . A purposive sample 30 parent caregiver technology-dependent child ( n=15 ReMind , n=15 Mind Only ) see outpatient clinic ( Pulmonology , Gastroenterology , Trach/Vent ) . The investigator use patient population prior work . Given availability potential subject investigator 's experience population , investigator anticipate little difficulty recruit 30 subject .</detailed_description>
