	<brief_title>A Dose-Finding Study Vedolizumab Treatment Steroid-Refractory Acute Intestinal Graft-Versus-Host Disease ( GvHD ) Participants Who Have Undergone Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation ( Allo-HSCT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug test study call vedolizumab . This study look tolerability effectiveness vedolizumab IV participant acute intestinal GvHD receive systemic therapy treatment acute GvHD ( prophylaxis acceptable ) corticosteroid . The study enroll approximately 38 patient . Participants randomly assign ( chance , like flip coin ) one two treatment group : - Vedolizumab IV 300 mg - Vedolizumab IV 600 mg All participant infuse intravenously time day throughout study . This multi-center trial conduct multiple country . The overall time participate study 36 month . Participants make multiple visit clinic last dose study drug follow-up assessment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Recipient 1 allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( alloHSCT ) 1 ( alloHSCT ) . 2 . Has primary steroidrefractory intestinal graftversushost disease ( GvHD ) . Steroidrefractory disease define worsen improvement 5 7 day treatment methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg equivalent lack complete response ( CR ) 14 day primary treatment methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg equivalent . Note participant develop intestinal GvHD receive systemic therapy GvHD still eligible 5 7 day , even intestinal GvHD present entire duration . Participants may receive increase steroid dose treatment ( e.g. , increase methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg 2 mg/kg ) enrollment eligible , provide participant meet definition steroid refractory . 3 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 3 . 4 . Evidence myeloid engraftment define absolute neutrophil count â‰¥0.5*109/L 3 consecutive day . 1 . Presence chronic GvHD Screening ( include acutechronic overlap syndrome ) . 2 . Relapse underlie malignant disease alloHSCT . 3 . Hyperacute GvHD define onset GvHD within first 15 day follow hematopoietic stem cell infusion . 4 . Received systemic agent corticosteroid treatment acute GvHD . GvHD prophylaxis agent ( e.g. , calcineurin inhibitor ) may continue . 5 . Acute steroidresistant GvHD beyond 28 day primary treatment . 6 . Life expectancy &lt; 3 week .</criteria>
