	<detailed_description>Chronic knee osteoarthritis ( OA ) one common diseases increase prevalence advance age . Knee OA result movement restriction , sleep disturbance , disability . Total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) employ often symptomatic treatment knee OA . It estimate 3.4 million TKAs perform year 2030 United States alone . Many study report reward outcome patient , research show many patient remain dissatisfied post-arthroplasty . As prevalence knee arthroplasty increase , frequency revision . It find 20 % patient report painful knee arthroplasty able diagnose specific cause therefore refer pain specialist . Pharmacologic therapy non-surgical intervention often employ minimal benefit patient 's level disability indicate clinical evidence . Genicular radiofrequency ablation seem safe , effective minimally invasive therapy chronic knee OA patient positive diagnostic block . No study determine whether genicular radiofrequency ablation relieve chronic post-arthroplasty knee pain . The investigator propose examine effect genicular radiofrequency ablation chronic post-arthroplasty knee pain patient respond positively diagnostic nerve block .</detailed_description>
