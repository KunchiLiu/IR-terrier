	<brief_summary>Background : People traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) often trouble sleep . TBI may also alter hormone , cause poor sleep . Researchers believe form growth hormone release hormone ( GHRH ) might improve sleep service member veteran TBI . Objective : To see GHRH improve sleep people TBI . Eligibility : Active duty service member veteran ( active duty past 10 year ) age 18-45 TBI past 6 month 10 year . Design : Participants screen : Medical history Physical exam Blood urine test Getting ACTH ( hormone ) intravenous catheter ( thin plastic tube ) Interview mood alcohol drug use Questionnaires TBI , mood , sleep Participants 2 overnight study visit couple week apart . These include : Physical exam Urine sample Two intravenous catheter place . Blood sample take throughout night . Two shot skin belly . The shot GHRH one visit placebo . Spending night sleep lab . Their brain wave record electrode place scalp . A questionnaire morning sleep Participants call day overnight visit . They ask feel rate sleep .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact GHRH Sleep Promotion Endocrine Regulation Service Members Who Sustained Traumatic Brain Injury Have Current Insomnia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) hallmark injury deployment Iraq Afghanistan . Up one-third service member sustain TBI diagnose sleep disorder ; insomnia one common . Currently , half TBI-associated insomnia case remain untreated due poor efficacy available pharmacologic agent . Neuroendocrine dysfunction important mechanism link TBI disorder sleep , thus pharmacological agent address dysfunction may effective treat TBI-related insomnia . The neuroendocrine system essential regulate sleep circadian function . Decreased neuroendocrine function , include hypothalamus somatotrophic cell anterior pituitary , regulate growth hormone secretion , likely contributes insomnia . This assertion support previous study demonstrate sleep-promoting effect growth hormone release hormone ( GHRH ) administration healthy control , elderly , participant depression . Therefore , propose administration GHRH address underlie mechanism insomnia service member veteran sustain TBI , provide pharmacological agent robust currently available treatment . Study population : This study recruit 50 active duty service member veteran document TBI participate one two study group . The insomnia group ( n=25 ) include participant current clinical diagnosis insomnia without obstructive sleep apnea . The no-insomnia group ( n=25 ) include participant current clinical diagnosis insomnia obstructive sleep apnea . Withdrawals/dropouts replace obtain 20 participant per group complete study . Design : A double-blind , randomize , crossover design use examine impact tesamorelin ( GHRH ( 1-44 ) analog ) placebo total non-rapid eye movement ( NREM ) time evaluate two polysomnography visit , schedule 1-3 week apart . Serial blood draw obtain polysomnography examine endocrine function neuropeptide release . Outcome measure : The primary outcome change NREM time follow tesamorelin administration compare placebo . The secondary outcome ( 1 ) within group difference plasma concentration level neuroendocrine proteins follow tesamorelin administration compare placebo ( 2 ) within group difference urinary concentration level growth hormone follow tesamorelin administration compare placebo .</detailed_description>
