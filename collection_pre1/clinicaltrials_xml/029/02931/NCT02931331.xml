	<detailed_description>1.0 HYPOTHESIS Regional absolute myocardial blood flow stress ( sMBF ) measure Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) improve post mechanical revascularization provide baseline stress induce perfusion defect . Coronary revascularization perform region without stress induce perfusion defect increase sMBF . 2.0 BACKGROUND Angiographic severity coronary artery stenosis historically primary guide mechanical revascularization and/or medical management coronary artery disease . Studies show patient stable coronary artery disease ( CAD ) percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) base angiographic stenosis severity reduce coronary event initial medical treatment . In contrast , randomize trial PCI report well outcomes guided fractional flow reserve ( FFR ) guide angiographic severity compare initial medical treatment . Several potential explanation propose conflict view . Revascularization procedure may alter natural history multicentric plaque rupture determine complex arterial vascular biology . CAD exist diffusely addition segmental stenosis , localized mechanical intervention may fail alter long-term disease progression outcome . Additionally , anatomic severity coronary angiography may reflect physiologic severity directly determine ischemia , leave ventricular function , prognosis . Invasive physiologic criterion fractional flow reserve ( FFR ) utilize invasive angiography educate decision make whether perform PCI , however FFR perform 6 % percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) United States . Consequently , percent stenosis coronary angiography remain main determinant decide proceed PCI . It well establish coronary angiography frequently unable adequately characterize hemodynamic impact coronary stenosis . In particular , percent stenosis predict reliably relate maximum flow capacity coronary flow reserve ( CFR ) . Studies clearly demonstrate anatomical assessment hemodynamic significance coronary stenosis determine visual modality coronary angiography compute tomography coronary angiography ( CTCA ) correlate well functional assessment FFR . It plausible , therefore , epicardial vessel target revascularization base percent stenosis , intervention may lead significant improvement myocardial blood flow fact could detrimental . Myocardial perfusion positron emission tomography ( PET ) well-established validated tool assess myocardial perfusion quantify absolute myocardial blood flow . As , cardiac PET serf ideal technology quantifying change flow revascularization procedure . Noninvasive myocardial perfusion image positron emission tomography ( PET ) combine high spatial resolution ( secondary tertiary coronary branch ) quantitative measure rest stress myocardial perfusion absolute unit compute absolute coronary flow reserve ( CFR ) . Quantitative myocardial perfusion PET extensive technically robust literature , 250 paper include almost 15,000 subject past 25 year . Furthermore , robust data demonstrate prognostic information obtain stress myocardial perfusion imaging . However , counterintuitive antithetical modern practice seem , prospective study demonstrate mechanical revascularization patient moderate high risk perfusion scan alters prognosis . In fact , ongoing International Study Comparative Health Effectiveness Medical Invasive Approaches ( ISCHEMIA ) trial seek determine question . This study seek determine regional effect mechanical revascularization patient abnormal cardiac PET stress test refer angiography . 3.0 Study Design Population This prospective , single center study Ochsner Medical Center . Adult patient stress induce perfusion defect myocardial PET scan undergo mechanical revascularization ask undergo subsequent myocardial PET scan mechanical revascularization complete . Socio-demographic data also collect participant 's electronic medical record . 4.0 Study Procedures All participant eligible inclusion identify ask enroll goal 50 participant . All Individuals already initial cardiac PET stress test ( PET 1 ) follow mechanical revascularization part routine medical care . Enrolled participant ask perform second cardiac PET stress test ( PET 2 ) within 12 week revascularization procedure ( ) . The stress agent , radiotracer protocol PET 1 PET 2 identical describe previous study . 5.0 Measurements Baseline absolute coronary flow CFR obtain major coronary artery territory [ leave anterior descending ( LAD ) , leave circumflex ( LCx ) , right coronary ( RCA ) ] use FDA-approved software . Vessels divide two group : 1 ) baseline perfusion defect match revascularized territory 2 ) baseline defect revascularized territory . The change pre-vascularization post-vascularization myocardial blood flow compare two group . Chart review participant interview include patient demographic , complete medical history , physical examination , laboratory data , 12-lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , Canadian Cardiovascular Society grade angina pectoris , procedure report LHC revascularization procedure . 6.0 Statistical Analysis Paired t-test average change absolute myocardial flow match unmatched revascularized territory perform use SPSS software . Participant group compare use Student 's t-test ( normally distribute variable ) Wilcoxon 's rank-sum test ( variable ) continuous variable X2 test Fisher 's exact test categorical variable . A P value le 0.05 consider statistically significant . Multiple logistic regression use determine association revascularization sMBF . 7.0 Reporting Adverse Events Unanticipated Problems involve Risk Participants Others This study deviate standard care one additional , clinically indicate PET stress test , perform soon mechanical revascularization . Adverse event unanticipated problem report Robert Bober , MD Fahad Javed , MD 504-842-2420 Internal Review Board direct Ochsner Medical Center IRB rule regulation . Furthermore , first 25 patient complete PET 2 , review adverse event unanticipated problem review safety monitoring committee comprise 3 cardiologist involve study . 8.0 Radiation Risks Participants enroll study receive additional ionizing radiation . The effective dose cardiac PET scan 5mSV less . This 1/10 10 % occupational exposure allow radiation worker . This also twice annual amount natural background radiation exposure . 9.0 Study Withdrawal/Discontinuation Participants opt withdraw study PET 2 perform . 10.0 Privacy/Confidentiality Issues All hard copy participant data keep securely PET department PET research staff access . All PET workstation encrypt password protect . All participant data PET result de-identified individual health information . 11.0 Follow-up Record Retention This study estimate take approximately 9 month obtain total 50 participant . Hard copy PET scan keep securely PET department PET research staff access . The electronic PET data encrypt password protect . Only study personnel access file .</detailed_description>
