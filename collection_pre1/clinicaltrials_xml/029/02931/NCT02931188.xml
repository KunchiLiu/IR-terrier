	<brief_summary>There currently study evaluate effect anacetrapib blood vessel function stiffness artery . The REVEAL-Vasc trial ass whether anacetrapib , addition atorvastatin ( LDL-C lower drug ) treatment , result great endothelial-dependent vascular function aortic stiffness patient establish cardiovascular disease , compare add placebo . Participants ask provide blood sample pulse Wave Velocity/Pulse Wave Analysis Flow Mediated Dilation carry assess blood vessel function stiffness artery . REVEAL-Vasc investigator lead sub-study HPS3/TIMI 55 : REVEAL ( Randomized Evaluation Effects Anacetrapib Lipid modification ) : A large-scale , randomized placebo-controlled trial clinical effect anacetrapib among people establish vascular disease ( NCT01252953 ) coordinate OXFORD CTSU . No treatment receive sub-study , therefore participant enrol HPS3/TIMI55 REVEAL participant receive anacetrapib atorvastatin placebo consider trial .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>REVEAL-Vasc investigator lead sub-study HPS3/TIMI 55 : REVEAL . Participants previously enrol HPS3/TIMI 55 : REVEAL receive treatment invited participate sub-study . Participants attend screen assessment visit Pulse Wave Velocity/ Pulse Wave Analysis Flow Mediated Dilation carry assess blood vessel function stiffness . A blood sample also take participant ass CRP lipid profile . Since participant receive treatment main trial HPS3/TIMI 55 : REVEAL , treatment receive sub-study .</detailed_description>
