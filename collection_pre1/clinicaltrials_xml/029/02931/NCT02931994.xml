	<detailed_description>It well establish origin gingivitis periodontal diseases occur colonization , accumulation subsequent maturation bacterial plaque , ( Loe et al 1965 , Socransky 1970 ) , mediate host immunological response ( Lewis et al , 2004 ) . Since , oral bacteria plaque biofilms essential component dental diseases process , current preventive oral health care focus thorough plaque removal prevent , reduce even reverse disease condition . ( Suomi 1971 , Schmid et al 1976 ) . In endeavor thorough plaque removal especially prevention accumulation , dental surgeon hygienist commonly recommend daily mechanical plaque removal , specifically tooth-brushing . Use toothbrush mechanically remove plaque extremely effective , yet able remove thoroughly interdental area use alone ( Hansen &amp; Gjermo 1971 ) Routine use dental floss conjunction tooth-brushing show reduce onset severity gingivitis ( Bergenholtz &amp; Britton 1980 , Carter-Hanson et al 1996 ) Patients ' reluctance inability perform floss regular basis mention ( Kresh 1976 ) . In addition , plaque control , patient also utilize floss clear interdental area wherein food impaction occur ( Gjermo &amp; Flotra 1970 ) . Schmid ( 1984 ) classify interdental embrasure , depend upon fill gingival embrasure interdental papilla . Hence Type I , floss use , Type II III incrementally wider proxabrush unitufted brush use respectively . Gomes et al present modification use knot floss wider embrasure area . ( Gomes et al 2016 ) . The modification dental floss do increase effective width floss . This enable use embrasure wider recommend conventional floss . In modification , knot tie floss distance middle third floss length . The floss insert past interdental contact point conventional finger floss technique non-knotted area 'to fro movement ' tooth surface cervical contact point , knot area engage embrasure ( Gomes et al 2016 ) The purpose study compare reduction clinical sign plaque accumulation , gingival inflammation gingival trauma area knot floss technique utilized versus area conventional flossing utilized Type I gingival embrasure . Patients ' acceptability knot flossing technique also evaluate . This study part large study protocol involve different sample group compare knot floss technique conventional dental flossing , use inter-dental brush unitufted brush type II type III embrasures well . Study Design : A sample size thirty subject select base model use Carter-Hanson et al 1996 . Prior commencement actual study , volunteer receive write verbal instruction two technique . The principal third investigator demonstrate volunteer technique model , half hour counsel session , three consecutive day . Each counsel session 10 participant . On third day volunteer 's proficiency model technique confirm demonstrator separately , informed consent take volunteer enrol subject fourteen week , 2-phase crossover , single ( examiner ) blind study protocol washout in-between phase . Failure volunteer perform technique instruct result another counseling session half hour he/she include study protocol . In first phase , 50 % subject randomly assign use either conventional flossing technique , 50 % assign use knot floss technique . Only first author know subject assign technique . The treatment phase consist 6 week daily use assign technique follow 'washout period ' 14 day , follow start second treatment phase wherein subject use flossing technique . i.e use conventional flossing technique use knot flossing technique vice versa . At baseline appointment phase , every subject give assign floss product . Subjects assign conventional flossing receive ninety piece wax floss , fifteen centimeter length piece , ( Reach¬® Johnson &amp; Johnson Inc. ) equally divide three ziplock® bag . Subjects assign knot flossing technique receive except every floss thread simple knot around middle . Each subject also receive sample Colgate® Soft Toothbrush Dentifrice ( Colgate® Inc ) . The registered subject instruct brush teeth twice day customary manner use toothbrush dentifrice provide caution use oral hygiene aid except assigned floss twice day . They instruct wrap floss around middle index finger gently slide floss teeth move along gum margin , curve `` c '' shape . After , move floss several time tooth without use excessive pressure , finally allow embrasure . The subject return third author unused floss product end phase . During 'washout period ' subject instruct perform normal oral hygiene practice tooth-brushing dentifrice refrain use floss additional plaque control aid . The `` washout '' period design give subject time return original oral status establish parity baseline clinical measurement prior start second treatment phase . Such 'washout ' study design allow use 50 % less subject . Clinical evaluation : Clinical evaluation subject do 2-weekly interval , namely baseline , 2 week , 4 week 6 week treatment phase . Both adjacent teeth gingiva test site score Rustogi Modification Navy Plaque Index , Modified Gingival Index ( Lobene 1986 ) Modified Papillary Bleeding Index ( Barnett 1980 ) . A plaque disclose agent use identify location amount plaque . Additionally , gingival trauma assess presence absence sign trauma marginal papillary gingiva adjacent teeth . The facial lingual surface examine visually gingival laceration . Presence laceration , floss cut , demarcation line/indentation site score one , score zero ( 0 ) record absence sign trauma . The score per subject obtain total score divide number site examine ( Carter-Hanson 1996 ) . The index record second fourth investigator . Intra- inter-examiner reliability establish prior commencement study two weekly interval . The study schedule distribute six subject report examination give day week . The two examiner knowledge technique subject use amount unused floss end phase . Subject compliance A compliance diary also give subject baseline appointment treatment phase collect end phase third investigator . The subject instruct record floss experience diary event he/she felt significant . Compliance establish dispense specific amount ( 90 piece ) assign floss product per treatment phase . At conclusion treatment phase , subject return principal third investigator , unused portion floss product thus non-compliance estimate . Additionally , patient satisfaction questionnaire substantiate subject compliance . This questionnaire answer every subject end second final phase .</detailed_description>
