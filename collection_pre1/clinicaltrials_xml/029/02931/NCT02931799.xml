	<detailed_description>Background : Hospital readmission rate key issue health policy place large burden healthcare system . Readmissions preventable source health care expenditure case , represent opportunity quality improvement . Lack standardization hospital discharge process , deficiency transition care discharge , predispose patient increase risk illness , hospital utilization healthcare cost . Previously identify issue discharge plan include timely transmission discharge summary primary care provider lack communication provider patient respect discharge medication follow-up appointment . Rationale : Various post-discharge intervention effective reduce hospital readmission rate increase patient satisfaction . However , patient flare Inflammatory Bowel Disease ( IBD ) , limited evidence suggest process care protective readmission . IBD patient frequently hospitalize , 22 % patient hospitalize within first 2 year diagnosis . Moreover , readmission rate high IBD population , 20 % patient readmitted within calendar year initial hospitalization . Alongside increase healthcare expenditure , hospitalization IBD population associate number nosocomial complication include venous thromboembolism infection . Specific Aim : The primary aim study determine whether standardized IBD post-discharge pathway , involve regular follow-up advanced practice nurse electronic monitoring web-based application , decrease risk IBD readmission compare usual standard care . Study Design : All IBD inpatient diagnosis Ulcerative Colitis ( UC ) Crohn 's Disease ( CD ) approach participate parallel group randomize control trial . Patients randomize control arm discharge usual post-discharge standard care . Patients randomize intervention arm receive usual post-discharge standard care , addition organise follow-up advance practice nurse electronic monitoring web-based application .</detailed_description>
