	<brief_summary>Selective bias attention modify simple computerized technique : The Attention Bias Modification Task ( ABM ) pioneer MacLeod et al . Cognitive bias may one reason depression recurs , alter bias reduce risk recurrence . Recently , evidence support hypothesis . The mechanisms ABM work well understood . More research need explore alter implicit attentional bias lead change subjective mood . One possible explanation positive attentional bias important component explicit method emotion regulation . The ability effectively regulate one 's emotion fundamental component mental health ability impair depression . It also show recover depressed people spontaneously show dysfunctional pattern emotion regulation compare never depress control . Supporting , grow evidence implicates dysregulation medial/orbitofrontal circuit mood disorder . This circuit include orbitofrontal cortex anterior cingulate cortex , ventral striatum , ventral pallidum medial thalamus . Components circuit reciprocally connect amygdala , implicate emotional processing healthy brain dysregulated depression . Negative emotion processing bias depend enhance `` bottom-up '' response emotionally salient stimulus reduce `` top-down '' cognitive control mechanism , require suppress response emotionally salient task irrelevant information . Cognitive reappraisal distance common strategy down- upregulate emotional response . Reappraisal emotion regulation strategy involve reinterpretation change way one think event stimulus goal change affective impact . Distancing type reappraisal involve create mental space oneself emotional event order see thing different , less self-focused perspective . It show distance strategy people improve time compare reinterpretation . The neural system support explicit regulation emotion previously characterize include lateral- prefrontal cortex . This frontal activity predict downregulate limbic circuitry involve amygdala passive view emotional salient stimulus .</brief_summary>
