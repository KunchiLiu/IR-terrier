	<detailed_description>Physicians ancient Greece understood smell breath patient assist diagnosis . However , rather primitive diagnostic method n't change much century , increase interest recent year improve method noninvasive early diagnosis numerous metabolic infectious disease . Currently , many disease miss exacerbate delayed diagnosis . In dental medicine , patient tend avoid visit dentist even regular checkup , thus appear clinic later , advance stage disease , suffer pain discomfort could easily prevent , present late stage disease , thus jeopardize treatment outcome . For reason , urgent need inexpensive minimally invasive technology would serve diagnostic aid , allow 1 ) efficient early detection 2 ) treatment customization . Diagnostic modality base detection volatile organic compound ( henceforth VOCs ) , i.e . organic compound relatively high vapor pressure room temperature , may answer aforementioned need . `` Electronic Noses '' Detection Volatile Organic Compounds Exhaled Air Disease-specific volatile organic compound produce mainly change specific biochemical pathway body . Following production either human bacterial cell , VOCs may find body fluid , include infected cell and/or microenvironment , blood , breath , saliva , among others . Thus , VOCs release origin directly detect blood headspace cell . Numerous worldwide research group investigate possibility non-invasive VOC detection exhale air , enable diagnosis various systemic diseases6 , include carcinoma ( lung , breast colorectal ) , tuberculosis , kidney failure asthma . The VOCs question alkane ( C4-C20 ) , methyl-alkenes benzene derivative , find healthy individual concentration 1-20ppb ( part per billion ) , disease , concentration disease-specific VOCs increase . VOCs suggest produce distressed tissue due oxidative stress , liver part metabolic reaction , immune system . An `` Electronic Nose '' device capable recognize volatile composition air sample . The device consist array nanoreceptors capable transform physical chemical information electric signal . Every receptor array react differently material analyze sample , combination response several receptor produce unique volatile profile , distinguishable quality ( namely , molecule find sample ? ) quantity ( namely , exact concentration molecule ? ) . An electronic nose system air sample analysis usually consist three key component : 1 . Breath / headspace collection device 2 . Processing device 3 . Classification algorithm . The first widespread device base air sample analysis Gas-Chromatography / Mass-Spectrometry ( GC-MS ) system . Advanced system include methyl-oxide sensor ( MOS ) nanoreceptors . A nanoreceptor-based electronic nose system ( NaNose ) develop , Laboratory co-PI ( Prof. Haick , Faculty Chemical Engineering , Technion , Haifa , Israel ) , capable detecting trace VOCs concentration single parts-per-billion ( 1µg/l ) . Paired computerized system able analyze large amount data hundred molecule , detect simultaneously array 20 receptor , system surpass `` electronic nose '' device term sensitivity efficiency . Contrary costly slow GC-MS system , ideal nanomaterial-based sensor breath test sensitive low concentration volatile organic compound , even presence environmental physiological confounding factor . It also respond rapidly proportionately small change concentration provide consistent output specific give compound . When contact compound question , sensor quickly return baseline state , simple inexpensive enough disposable . Air sample receptor comparably simple , result may interpret automatically , make suitable cost effective screen large population . Only positively tested patient require conventional unpleasant diagnostics confirm early diagnosis , treatment suggest . Nevertheless , exist VOC base diagnostic modality tend forget exhale air combination numerous origins - lung , upper GI tract , oral cavity small nasal component . While composition volatile profile air lung thoroughly research recent decade , mean find early diagnostic approach cancer10,15 , oral component remain largely untouched . Micro niches oral cavity healthy individual ' harbor biofilm may contain 1000 different bacterial specie . In absence active mechanical chemical cleansing , biofilm accumulates , change matures , cause soft tissue inflammation , know gingivitis . In individual certain condition , inflammation progress periodontal disease , biofilm composition change high proportion anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria increase virulence tissue-breakage capability . Aside biofilm microorganism , additional source VOCs oral cavity may include serum , gingival exudate , inflame gum tissue , sores lesion , pathology associate salivary gland , sinus nasal cavity , gastrointestinal reflux , interdental trap food debris , environmental pollutes . Hertel et al . recently report unique volatile profile headspace specific oral bacteria fungi . We hypothesize nanoreceptor-based volatolomics use diagnostic modality non-invasive early diagnosis oral disease , base sample exhale air . The propose research aim lay foundation fast , user-friendly non-invasive diagnostic modality common oral disease exhale air sample , base NaNose . This serve foreseeable future base creation marketable clinical home-based diagnostic device . Specific aim : 1 . Detection analysis VOCs connect common oral disease headspace microorganism sample oral cavity patient diagnose gingivitis , periodontal disease caries , compare control group healthy patient . 2 . Characterization volatile profile common oral disease define specify diagnostic nanoreceptors . Desired Outcomes 1 . The result propose research may lead revolution among dental professional , well home care . To date , way individual learn oral condition schedule appointment dentist , yet significant proportion population avoids regular checkup treatment . An easy tool enable simple non-invasive air sample home drugstore significantly increase patient compliance curability rate , decrease healthcare expenditure . 2 . VOC map air originate oral cavity may increase diagnostic value air sample originate lung , thus improve precision , sensitivity specificity non-invasive early diagnosis cancer , kidney failure internal disease . Methods Stage 1 - Detection analysis VOCs connect common oral disease Known bacterial strain ( Streptococcus mutans , Streptococcus sanguinis , Porphyromonas gingivalis , Fusobacterium nucleatum , Acinetobacter actinomycetemcomitans , Tannerella forsythia , Lactobacillus acidophilus ) cultivate separately seal bottle contain appropriate medium , enable collection analysis unique headspace inside bottle . After cultivation , headspace collect Tenax absorbent tube ( Sigma-Aldrich , 28718-U SUPELCOTenax® TA / Carboxen® 1018 ) analyze GC-MS ( Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry ) . A unique volatile profile every bacterial strain determine via statistical analysis . The complete trial protocol available Addendum 1 . Three ( 3 ) repetition perform strain . Stage 2 - Characterization volatile profile common oral disease define specify diagnostic nanoreceptors The tested sample oral bacterial plaque infect dentin , cultivate sealed bottle similarly Stage 1 . The patient originate student ' clinic , sample take part dental treatment , namely : removal caries infect dentin future restoration , dental calculus plaque removal treatment periodontal disease . 1 . In begin treatment session , informed consent obtain patient , agree usage remove plaque / infect dentin research . No deviation standard treatment protocol expect . 1 . The plaque sample periodontal patient take gross scaling commence , manual tool ( Gracey 5-6 curette ) , cervical area mandibular incisor . 2 . The infected dentin sample carious teeth take manual tool ( Spoon Excavator ) , initial form prepared cavity outline . 2 . The collected sample cultivate sealed bottle contain Wilkins-Chalgren medium , 37°C 48 hour , similarly Stage 1 . A bottle sterile medium use control . 3 . Headspace collect analyze similarly point 5-8 Stage 1 . 4 . At point , unique volatile profile patient link clinical diagnosis ( extent periodontal disease / caries ) , analyzed statistical consistency . 5 . Data gather stage 1-2 statistically analyzed whole .</detailed_description>
