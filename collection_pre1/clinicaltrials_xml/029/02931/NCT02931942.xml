	<brief_summary>Rationale : Recent study show ascorbic acid ( AA ) stimulate proliferation maturation T lymphocytes NK cell . Chemotherapy result depletion cell thereby increase infection rate . A pilot study show low level AA plasma several patient chemotherapy hematological malignancy . AA suppletion could beneficial recovery immune system patient . But intervention study undertaken , understand change time AA level relationship immune status chemotherapy necessary . Objective : The aim pilot study evaluate changing time AA level plasma leukocytes chemotherapy treatment several different group patient compare healthy control . In way want identify patient intervention could useful use data development intervention study power calculation identify primary endpoint . Study design : observational study Study population : There 6 different group participant study : two group patient receive clinical intensive chemotherapy ( acute leukemia high dose chemotherapy autologous stem cell rescue ) , two group patient receive relatively mild chemotherapy outpatient set ( colon cancer lung cancer ) two control group . All participant adult recruit MUMC+ . In total 150 participant . Main study parameters/endpoints : Influence chemotherapy AA level plasma leukocyte .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Rationale : Recent study show ascorbic acid ( AA ) stimulate proliferation maturation T lymphocytes NK cell . Chemotherapy result depletion cell thereby increase infection rate . A pilot study show low level AA plasma several patient chemotherapy hematological malignancy . AA suppletion could beneficial recovery immune system patient . But intervention study undertaken , understand change time AA level relationship immune status chemotherapy necessary . Objective : The aim pilot study evaluate changing time AA level plasma leukocytes chemotherapy treatment several different group patient compare healthy control . In way want identify patient intervention could useful use data development intervention study power calculation identify primary endpoint . Study design : observational study Study population : There 6 different group participant study : two group patient receive clinical intensive chemotherapy ( acute leukemia high dose chemotherapy autologous stem cell rescue ) , two group patient receive relatively mild chemotherapy outpatient set ( colon cancer lung cancer ) two control group . All participant adult recruit MUMC+ . In total 150 participant . Main study parameters/endpoints : Influence chemotherapy AA level plasma leukocyte . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : If participant really lack AA chemotherapy , AA supplementation could beneficial immune recovery many future patient chemotherapy . However , participant benefit yet , study interfere current clinical practice . The risk associate participation study low . Venous blood sampling perform skilled experienced laboratory technician . For study , small amount blood , 5 7 time 17 ml need . Therefore harm expect . Blood withdrawal could result hematoma , usually harmful . Bleedings blood withdrawal usually negligible .</detailed_description>
