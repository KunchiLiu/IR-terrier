	<brief_title>ACTH A Re-emerging theRapy Uveitis ( The ACTHAR Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Uveitis term use describe group inflammatory disorder involve uveal tract ( iris , ciliary body choroid ) . It amongst common cause list preventable cause blindness develop world . H.P . Acthar Gel highly purify sterile preparation adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH ) gelatin provide prolong release intramuscular subcutaneous ( SC ) injection . ACTH part group molecules call melanocortins ( MC ) ( ACTH , α , β , γ-MSH ) produce , human body , breakdown common large precursor call proopiomelanocortin ( POMC ) . A well-known anti-inflammatory mechanism action ACTH production glucocorticoid stimulate adrenal gland . ACTH also show bind five melanocortin receptor ( MCRs ) . MCRs variety role include cortisol production regulation immune modulation ACTH . ACTHAR open-label , multi-center , randomize , phase II study evaluate effect two dose regimen repeat SC injection ACTH gel patient active non-infectious intermediate , posterior , pan-uveitis follow period 12 month . ACTHAR study conduct 7 clinical site USA . The study coordinate Ocular Imaging Research Reading Center ( OIRRC ) , serve coordinate reading center ACTHAR Study . The primary endpoint study month 6 , active , as-needed treatment extension phase month 6 month 12 . Thirty-six ( 36 ) patient non-infectious intermediate , posterior , pan-uveitis enrol randomize ( 1:1 ) one two treatment arm : 1 . Mandatory twice week ( Mondays Thursdays ) treatment SC ACTH gel 80 U/day start BL month 6 . Starting month 6 , treatment administer need basis , base retreatment criterion . 2 . Mandatory thrice week ( Mondays , Wednesdays , Fridays ) treatment SC ACTH gel 80 U/day start BL month 6 . Starting month 6 , treatment administer need basis , base retreatment criterion . Starting month 6 , retreatment offer study subject demonstrate level response first 6 month meet Retreatment Criteria list . Patients receive retreatment receive dose assign randomization .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>In order eligible study , patient require meet criterion 1 3 follow disease cohort : 1 . Active disease receive treatment . Active disease define least 1+ Vitreous Haze use Standardized Uveitis Nomenclature ( SUN ) Working Group scale and/or least 1+ Vitreous Cell Count use Foster &amp; Vitale scale . 2 . Active disease receive prednisone ≥10 mg/day ( equivalent dose another corticosteroid ) least 1 systemic immunosuppressant ( systemic immunosuppressant corticosteroid discontinue 30 day prior first administration study drug Day 0 ) . Patients receive combination prednisone ≥10 mg/day least one systemic immunosuppressant also eligible category . 3 . Have inactive disease , define &lt; = 0.5+ Vitreous Haze OR &lt; = 0.5+ Vitreous Cell Count ( SUN scale ) , receive prednisone ≥10 mg/day ( equivalent dose another corticosteroid ) least 1 systemic immunosuppressant ( systemic immunosuppressant corticosteroid discontinue 30 day prior first administration study drug Day 0 ) .
