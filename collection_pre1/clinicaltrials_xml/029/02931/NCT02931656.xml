	<detailed_description>The study conduct Institute Medicine Professor Fernando Figueira ( IMIP ) , Brazil . The patient include study consent explanation study goal . Women consider eligible enrollment fulfill inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion . Sample size calculate aim reduce glucose level 20 % intervention GDM group . A power 80 % level significance 5 % accept calculated sample size arm 30 patient . Assuming drop 20 % , 72 pregnant woman include study . 36 gestational diabetic 36 normoglycemic pregnant woman develop aquatic physical exercise thermal pool , 45 minute per one time , rehabilitation center IMIP . Before practice aquatic exercise woman physical capacity assess Six minute walk test fetal condition assess ultrasound . They also submit dermatological examination specialist . Primary endpoint glucose level ( glycemic test ) , secondary endpoint follow maternal fetal : blood pressure , heart rate , respiratory rate , oxygen saturation level , fetal cardio beat fetal movement.The variable measure water exercise session . Maternal fetal characteristic study sample present group , intervention control term mean standard deviation . For group comparison glucose level maternal fetal variable , continuous nominal data analyze test unpaired data χ2 test , respectively . Data analyze use intention-to-treat principle . Statistical analysis perform STATA version 12.0 level significance set &lt; 0.05 . Even case appearance criterion discontinuation intervention ( Aquatic physical exercise ) , patient consider part group initially include randomization ( intent treat ) exclude study . The physical propriety water provide aquatic exercise ideal pregnant woman . An aquatic physical exercise program develop pregnant woman thermal pool physiotherapist supervision must ensure compliance . It expect study provide evidence real role aquatic physical exercise glycemic control GDM .</detailed_description>
