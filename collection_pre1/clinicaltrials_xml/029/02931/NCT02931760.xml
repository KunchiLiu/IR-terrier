	<brief_title>Placement Of Cardiac PacemaKer Trial ( POCKET ) -RCT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Implantation cardiac pacemaker may indicate patient significant bradycardia accord current guidelines.1 Annually , around 691 pacemaker per million inhabitant implanted Sweden.2 A pacemaker system consist one two lead connect device implant beneath collarbone.3,4 Vessel access typically leave side cephalic , axillary subclavian vein . The pacemaker insert pocket . Routinely pocket pectoral fascia ( subcutaneously ) sometimes skinny patient small amount subcutaneous fat pectoral muscular layer ( intramuscular ) . Even though technical development diminish size pacemaker markedly time , complication due superficial implant still occur.5,6 Occasionally device erode skin complete extraction system necessary . More frequently patient complain device superficial sometimes require surgical repositioning device.5,6 The device may create discomfort , pain , unsightly.5,6 The lateral corner device may disturb shoulder movement , sleep lead turn within pocket ( Twiddler 's syndrome ) . Minor branch supraclavicular nerve may result discomfort . When vessel subcutaneous adipose tissue distort , extensive bruising may bothersome large hematoma know risk infection . The perfusion operation area diminish amount fat device may reduce extent unexpected first implant . The change device due battery depletion result even less surrounding tissue . An alternative approach intramuscular placement device.7,8 This advocate Kistler et al base personal experience neither systematic observational study randomize controlled study support approach.6 To knowledge investigator randomize controlled trial address question optimal placement bradycardia pacemaker . Aim : To compare patient satisfaction intramuscular placement pacemaker pocket subcutaneous placement . Research question : Primary outcome : Is different patient overall satisfaction ( Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) -scale 0-10 ) pocket patient intramuscular placement pacemaker pocket patient subcutaneous placement 24 month implant ? Secondary outcome : Complications ( revision pocket , dislodgement , hematoma require surgery , infection ( local/systemic ) . Patient report satisfaction 1 , 12 , 24 month ( overall satisfaction , pain , discomfort , degree unsightly look , movement problem due device , sleep problem due device ) . Pacemaker nurse judgement unsightly look pacemaker pocket ( month 1 , 12 , 24 ) . Picture pocket ( 1 , 12 , 24 month ) judge experienced implanting physician blind group allocation operate patient . Method : Power analysis : investigator perform power analysis base expectation clinical experience research group . Figure 1 show two hypothetical truncate lognormal distribution patient overall satisfaction pacemaker , median overall satisfaction intramuscular subcutaneous group assume 2.4 4 , respectively . Monte Carlo-simulations distribution show total 200 patient , 100 arm , would yield statistical power 90 % Mann-Whitney U-test significance level 0.05 . In total , 200 consecutive patient indication expect randomize study ( 100 patient arm , intramuscular v subcutaneously ) . In Region Gavleborg , annual primary implant volume bradycardia pacemaker approximately 220 . Figure 1 . Assumed distribution patient overall satisfaction power analysis , measure visual analogue scale 0 mean `` satisfied '' 10 mean `` dissatisfied '' . The intramuscular group assume follow lognormal distribution mean 1.5 standard deviation 1 , logarithmic scale . The subcutaneous patient assume follow lognormal distribution mean 1.5 standard deviation 1 , logarithmic scale . Randomization : At time implant 1:1 randomization ( 100 patient group ) either subcutaneous ( usual care ) intramuscular implant , block random block size . The randomization perform statistician insight ongoing clinical work patient ' group allocation reveal implant physician assistant nurse start surgical procedure . Randomization procedure : stratification ( age stratum : â‰¤65 year &gt; 65 year ) sex ( female , male ) ; totally 4 stratum ) . Consecutive group allocation store sealed opaque envelope open time start implant procedure . Inclusion : Indication bradycardia pacemaker ( DDDR , VVIR ) . Exclusion : Cardiac Resynchronisation Therapy Pacemaker ( CRTP ) , Cardiac Resynchronisation Therapy Defibrillator ( CRTD ) , implantable cardioverter defibrillator ( ICD ) . Very skinny patient deem implanting physician clearly benefit intramuscular implant . Surgical procedure : Standard procedure vascular access operator 's preference . Blunt dissection pocket . Statistical method : For comparison group : Mann-Whitney U-test . For test change VAS-estimations 1 , 12 , 24 month : pair-wise Wilcoxon signed-rank test . Informed consent : Written oral information nurse/physician implant . Ethical approval : Approved Uppsala Regional Committee . Clinical Trial Registration : Registration start study . Variables : Clinical variable : age , sex , coronary artery disease , open-heart surgery , diabetes , kidney disease Pacemaker system : ( VVIR , DDDR ) , brand , model ( lead ( ) device . Vascular access : ( cephalic , axillary , subclavian vein ) , fluro-time , procedure time Periprocedural analgetics ( dosage ) : alfentanil , morphine , diazepam , paracetamol Pre och post-operative anticoagulant medication ( dosage withdrawal respect procedure : acetylic acid , clopidogrel , ticagrelor , dual oral anticoagulant , warfarin , low-molecular weight heparin ) Preoperative current medication : ( psychoactive drug , betablockers , corticosteroid , inflammatory modulate drug Outcome measurement : Patient satisfaction ( overall , chronic pain , discomfort , degree unsightly look , movement disorder due device , sleep problem due device ) scale 0-10 ( 10 worst ) Paper questionnaire 1,12 , 24 month . Patient knowledge device intramuscular subcutaneously implant 24 month . Pacemaker nurse judgement : unsightly look ( 0-10 , 10 bad ) . Physician evaluation ( blind patient operator study ) : photo pocket ( 1 , 12 , 24 month ) scale 0-10 ( 10 worst ) . Complications require surgery : pocket revision , dislodgment , hematoma require surgery , infection ( local , systemic ) , pneumothorax , pericardial effusion require drainage , . Clinical perspective : The surgical approach pacemaker pocket need evaluate . The optimal approach include patient report outcome may result long-term satisfaction may reduce need pocket revision .</detailed_description>
