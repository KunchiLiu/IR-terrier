For allergy , immunotherapeutic regimen ( `` hyposensitization '' ) establish , e.g . insect venom allergy pollen allergy . This project aim identify T cell activation potential vivo rest T cell patient undergo immunotherapy ( IT ) via system biology approach . For participant , involve blood draw stool collection well gather basic medical information . The participation take one week patient undergo insect venom IT three month patient undergo pollen IT .

	<detailed_description>Summary study : Applying system immunology search personalize biomarkers clinical efficacy : Predicting T cell activation potential vivo rest T cell patient . Introduction Allergy affect 20 % population develop country . The major allergic disease , allergic rhinitis , asthma , food allergy urticaria , chronic , cause major disability , costly individual society ( World Allergy Organisation ( WAO ) white book 2013 ) . Besides occupational allergy , common allergy cause food , pollen , dust , mold , animal dander , insect sting , medications…Allergic phenomenon due exacerbate response immune system antigens tolerate non-allergic patient . After exposure antigen , naive CD4+ ( cluster differentiation 4 ) T cell differentiate different subset T helper ( Th ) cell ( Th1 , Th2 , Th9 , Th17 , Th22 , Tfh ) induce suppressive regulatory T cell characterize different cytokine expression pattern , transcription factor surface marker , orchestrate adaptive innate immune response stimuli . Th2 cell central player various form Immunoglobulin E ( IgE ) -associated allergic disease thus regard dominant T cell subset sustain allergic response . Upon antigen uptake process antigen-presenting cell , CD4+ T cell polarize towards Th2 phenotype , lead expression Th2 cell-associated cytokine Interleukin ( IL ) -4 , -5 , -9 , -13 , switch B cell response toward IgE production ( sensitization early phase ) . Allergen-specific IgE bind high-affinity receptor ( FcεRI ) innate immune cell include basophil mast cell , trigger release anaphylactogenic mediator ( cytokine , chemokines , histamine , heparin , serotonin protease ) responsible inflammatory cell recruitment allergic symptom ( effector late phase ) . Identifying network gene express rest activate Th2 cell allergic patient would help distinguish gene candidate predict immune tolerance allergen . Allergies diseases involve many cell subset . The specific reactivity contribution clinical picture closely interdependent fully decipher yet . The interplay different actor cellular immune system complexified existence commensal intestinal flora , also call microbiota . Gut microbiota partially supervision immune system , dysregulations change composition microbiota , example due antibiotic uptake childhood /or different eat habit , may impact adaptative innate immune function . Characterization gut microbiota human host undergo immunotherapy might high interest delineate interaction microbiota adaptive immune system . Despite substantial improvement medication relieve daily allergy symptom , percentage patient still experience uncontrolled severe symptom . For patient , strictly avoid allergen keep emergency medication within reach best recommendation far , burden living allergy ultimately result psychosocial , health , occupational economic problem impact public health cost . In case , best feasible solution improve quality life apply immunotherapeutic approach induce allergen tolerance . Allergen-specific immunotherapy ( AIT ) implement 100 year , achieves sustain unresponsiveness administrate escalate dos causative allergen maintenance dose reach . Immunotherapeutic protocol span different duration ( hour ultra-rush protocol week month conventional protocol ) apply treatment food , pollen , pet dander insect sting allergy . Desensitization take place sequential step early desensitization mast cell basophil , skew T- B-cell response towards regulatory phenotype , modulation allergen-specific antibody isotypes inhibition migration mediator release eosinophil , basophil mast cell . Questions remain however early event take place initiation immunotherapy , whether mechanisms different rush conventional protocol . Immunotherapy outcome may relate event occur different cell subset , identification predictive biomarkers tolerance induction still highly need . To aim , system biology apply . Systems biology aim gather information complex biological system ( example , transcriptomics data ) apply computational tool well understand predict whether degree system react perturbation . Based `` omics '' data , system biology give big picture cellular event occur course AIT approach focus isolate gene candidate signal pathway . This systemic approach allow build inference predictive gene expression network could determine use hypothesis-based approach . Rationale research project : Human individual show great variance innate adaptive immune response follow immune stimulus . However , little known molecular subnetworks quantitatively control immune response potential . Until , predictive biomarkers clinical efficacy vaccination antigen-specific immunotherapy allergy establish . The current proposal pilot study identify candidate interest , predictive value biomarkers assess study involve large group patient appropriate control . The investigator hypothesize early molecular event cell stimulation successful AIT correlate regulatory immune responsive signature innate ( Natural killer ( NK ) cell , innate lymphoid cell ) adaptive ( T B cell ) immune cell . In regard , characteristic rest ( AIT ) Th2 cell allergic patient early change occur population within course AIT could ultimately predict therapeutic outcome . The aim project develop system biology strategy quantitatively predict response potential activate Th2 ( T-helper type 2 ) cell rest Th2 cell allergic patient undergo allergen desensitization treatment . The investigator plan analyze transcriptome cell different timepoints throughout course AIT infer network gene expression allow u determine key prognostic factor AIT responsiveness immune tolerance induction . In parallel Th2 cell , investigator study role subpopulation NK cell , role subset allergy still largely unknown . Additionally , gut microbiota know associated interact immune system , investigator seize opportunity collect microbiota sample patient undergo AIT ass change might occur desensitization . The completion study allow u ) identify potential biomarkers might ultimately use predict therapy outcome refine adapt therapy patient 's feature ii ) monitor change occur NK cell patient exposed desensitization procedure , iii ) study gut microbiota allergic patient explore potential microbiota predictive biomarkers ( part study perform IBBL ) . This study stand proof-of-concept study start future large cohort , since discovery new biomarkers/features could open new avenue understand disorder link immune dysregulation tolerance induction require , autoimmune disease , transplant rejection others . Methodology : Patients enrol study allergic patient Immuno-Allergology department CHL , anyway undergo routine antigen-specific immunotherapy medical reason . These immunotherapeutic protocol already establish use experienced specialist CHL modify purpose research project . If patient eligible AIT agree participate research project , investigator collect blood stool sample course treatment . Depending allergy treat , two routine desensitization protocol : ultra-rush protocol perform insect sting desensitization , conventional protocol use pollen desensitization .</detailed_description>
