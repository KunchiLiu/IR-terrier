	<brief_title>MITIGATE-NeoBOM : A Study Evaluate 68Ga- NeoBOMB1 Patients With Advanced TKI-treated GIST Using PET/CT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale design : This monocentric diagnostic Phase I/IIa study . Due limit number patient rare nature disease study design combination phase I IIa . The main objective early phase clinical trial safety tolerability , pharmacokinetics ( case radiopharmaceutical ) dosimetry aspect . For first 6 patient , focus study safety , tolerability pharmacokinetics . Therefore , TKI-resistant TKI-sensitive GIST patient include . As resistant patient typically 2nd- 3rd-line TKI treatment prone substantial side effect potentially suffer great extent disease , study design include limited number non-resistant GIST patient address possible bias regard tolerability side effect profile 68Ga-NeoBOMB1 . After 6 include patient interim analysis safety pharmacokinetic data include PBPK model dosimetry calculation perform . Thereby decide , whether data generation sufficient final calculation dosimetry , pharmacological dosimetric aspect omit last 6 patient , reduce burden patient considerably ( less number scan , blood urine sampling ) . This analysis also reveal optimal time window PET/CT imaging . After establishment baseline finding , second part study emphasize assessment image data towards target property GRP ( gastrin release peptide ) -receptor-specific radiopharmaceutical 68Ga-NeoBOMB1 proof molecular imaging principle . In phase patient confirm GRPR receptor expression via Immunohistochemistry include . Nonetheless , safety tolerability still remain primary objective part study . As preclinical indication GRP receptor status TKI resistance variable , objective meet include target property 68Ga-NeoBOMB1 also non-resistant patient . Nonetheless , change GRP-receptor expression treatment pressure may still exist . Therefore phase minimum 50 % patient show resistance TKI treatment , therapeutic option extremely limited . This allow providing data patient likely benefit improve target characterisation GRPR target therapy approach . Study conduct : Within 28 day patient 's positive evaluation write informed consent , image study perform . During study , patient shortly hospitalise . These pre-planned hospitalisation study purpose consider ( serious ) adverse event . The radiopharmaceutical administered patient directly image system ( PET-CT ) . In first phase trial include first six patient series dynamic scan 0 45 min static whole-body PET image 1 , 2 3-4h obtain determine pharmacokinetics absorbed dos normal organ tumorous lesion . Blood sample draw concomitantly time image collected estimate residence time blood derive bone marrow absorb dose ( max . 10 sample hospitalisation ) . Urine collect determine bladder wall kidney absorb dos . Regions interest critical organ tumour lesion draw use acquire image result time-activity curve quantitative fraction administer activity . Residence time radioactivity analysis calculate . All dosimetric calculation perform feed residence time well blood urine activity appropriate software program ( OLINDA/EXAM ) . The second phase principle conduct way , interim analysis return sufficient data dosimetry pharmacokinetics , PET image reduce 2 whole body scan within optimal time window blood urine sampling omit .</detailed_description>
