	<brief_summary>A prospective , multi-center , dual-arm pivotal study BioVentrix Revivent TC System , 2:1 study vs. active concurrent control group allocation ratio . This study include 126 patient 84 patient treat investigational device 42 patient include active control group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BioVentrix Revivent TC™ System Clinical Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Revivent TC System indicate patient referred surgical treatment leave ventricular scar contiguous , include anterior septal component . Primary Secondary Effectiveness Endpoints compare data patient treat Revivent TC System control pool patient comply aspect protocol except scar location treat investigational device remain Guideline Directed Medical Therapy ( GDMT ) . The primary safety effectiveness endpoint evaluate 12 month post procedure . The study conduct maximum 20 clinical center .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>LV Aneurysm Scar Presence : Defined contiguous acontractile ( akinetic and/or dyskinetic ) scar LV Aneurysm Scar Location : Defined scar involve septum anterior , apical anterolateral region leave ventricle evidence cardiac imaging refer surgical management ; Viability myocardium region remote area intend scar exclusion evidence cardiac imaging ; Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction &lt; 45 % . Left ventricular endsystolic volume index ≥50 mL/m2 Suffering heart failure symptom define NYHA Classification &gt; 2 responsive medical therapy ; Patient complete 6 Minute Walk Test MLHF Quality Life Questionnaire Patient adequate Guideline Directed Medical Therapy ( GDMT ) Subject legally authorize representative must provide write informed consent ; Agree require followup visit ; Female subject childbearing potential plan pregnancy least one year follow index procedure . For female childbearing potential , pregnancy test must perform negative result know within seven day prior index procedure Candidates study group must meet ALL inclusion criterion . Candidates allocate active concurrent control group must meet inclusion criterion ( include LV Aneurysm Scar Presence ) , WITH THE EXCEPTION OF LV Aneurysm Scar Location . Candidates exclude study active concurrent control group ANY follow condition present : Calcified ventricular wall area intend anchor implant verify cardiac imaging ; Thrombus intraventricular mass leave atrium ventricle verify cardiac imaging ; Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy ( CRT ) device placement ≤ 60 day prior enrollment ; Valvular heart disease , opinion investigator , require surgery ; Functional Mitral Regurgitation great moderate ( i.e . EROA &gt; 20mm sq . ) degenerative MR ( include MR due papillary muscle rupture ) ; Need coronary revascularization , opinion site investigator ; Contraindication inability adhere systemic anticoagulation ; Peak Systolic Pulmonary Arterial Pressure &gt; 60 mm Hg via echo right heart catheterization and/or evidence cor pulmonale ; Myocardial Infarction within 90 day prior enrollment ; Prior CVA TIA within last six month , prior intracranial hemorrhage , permanent neurologic deficit , know intracranial pathology ; Comorbid disease process life expectancy le one year active malignancy remission ; Any solid organ transplant wait list solid organ transplant cardiac ; Chronic renal failure serum creatinine &gt; 2.5 mg/dL and/or GFR &lt; 30ml/min ; Pulmonary disease would preclude single lung ventilation ; Subject currently participate another clinical trial yet complete primary endpoint ; Known hypersensitivity contraindication device material ; Previous pericardiotomy leave thoracotomy ; Pathology/previous surgery/radiation therapy right neck ; Prior open heart surgery significant pericarditis ; Presence significant ventricular arrhythmia</criteria>
