	<brief_summary>With limited prospective longitudinal data currently available Creatine Transporter Deficiency ( CTD ) , natural history present incompletely understood . This international study design provide additional insight disease progression , characterize patient perform clinical neurodevelopmental assessment , evaluate magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) event-related potential ( ERPs ) patient CTD .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Observational Study Males With Creatine Transporter Deficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This observational study design determine appropriate clinical assessment battery male CTD , evaluate MRS along potential biomarkers . It design explore developmental domain interest examine feasibility utility various neuropsychological assessment measure domains interest , identify possible endpoint interventional study . Study also explore genotype-phenotype correlation . This study consist Screening Period , Baseline period , Ongoing Assessment Periods . During Screening Period , subject assess study eligibility include verification exist laboratory evidence pathologic mutation SLC6A8 gene . A comprehensive history physical neurological examination , include evaluation growth dysmorphic feature , complete subject . During Baseline Period , caregiver interview study staff administer scales/questionnaires study site . For purpose protocol , duly authorized patient representative ( e.g . parent , legal guardian ) refer caregiver . Biological , physiological radiographic assessment , include ERP recording , MRS , skin biopsy , cerebrospinal fluid , urine blood obtain . During Ongoing Assessment Period , growth assessment limit physical neurological examination perform . All scales/questionnaires repeat every 6 month ( Â± 2 week ) 24 month either study site instruction completion home . Clinical adverse event monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>
