	<detailed_description>Due potentially serious toxicity result use topical anesthetic relieve symptom associate gingival inflammatory condition gum trauma infant , recently , product contain Hyaluronic Acid market Europe . In particular , Ricerfarma develop several high molecular weight Hyaluronic Acid medical device characterize absence preservative , alcohol dye ; therefore , administration product infant safe help create natural protective layer gingival tissue . In previous clinical trial high molecular weight Hyaluronic Acid medical device note periodontal tissue/fluid balance accelerate heal repair property could interest either accelerate wound heal process treat complex physical symptom ( i.e . soreness swell gum , cry , sleeplessness ) relate teethe infant . These data confirm recent pilot study 18 infant suffer teethe two formulation test high molecular weight Hyaluronic Acid medical device evidence , end treatment period , pain , swell , gingival rush , hyper-salivation redness statistically significant reduction baseline .</detailed_description>
