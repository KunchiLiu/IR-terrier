	<detailed_description>The trajectory HIV epidemic come decade determine degree identify infect person engage care - point implicit ambitious UNAIDS `` 90-90-90 '' target , set 90 % goal HIV diagnosis , linkage infect person sustain antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) , viral suppression treat . Meeting target require successful engagement difficult reach population , people inject drug ( PWID ) men sex men ( MSM ) , bear disproportionate share epidemic , particularly low middle income country . Our team near completion multi-site cluster-randomized trial India ass effectiveness integrate care center ( ICCs ) PWID MSM compare usual care . ICC process measure first year show robust uptake HIV counsel testing , primary outcome trial , slow anticipated ART uptake . Demand-side intervention public health ( treatment incentive ) particularly effective pair optimized treatment accessibility ( i.e. , supply ) . Consequently , investigator propose examine whether provision HIV care treatment incentive ICC client improve overall utilization clinic downstream HIV care continuum outcomes . The investigator propose hybrid effectiveness-implementation design . This include 16-site , pair-matched cluster randomize trial compare effectiveness add HIV care incentive ICCs ( ICC+ ) versus standard ICCs HIV care continuum outcome , include ART initiation , adherence viral suppression . Effectiveness compare ICC level ( cohort HIV-infected ART-eligible client follow ICC process measure derive ICC client ) community-level cross-sectional sample accrue via respondent-driven sampling ( RDS ) 2 year initiation intervention . Because PWID MSM sample independently ICCs RDS , provide opportunity characterize outcome like community viral load HIV incidence , reflect impact within broad PWID/MSM community . As exploratory sub-aim , use rigorous scientific design ass effect withdraw ( vs. continue ) incentives beyond initial intervention phase . Additionally , investigator determine cost-effectiveness ICC+ intervention .</detailed_description>
