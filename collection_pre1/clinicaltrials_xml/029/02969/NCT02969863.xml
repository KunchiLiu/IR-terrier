	<brief_summary>To conduct outpatient study test two configuration bionic pancreas ( bi-hormonal insulin-only ) without remote monitoring hypoglycemia 25 adult ( ≥ 18 year age ) subject type 1 diabetes random-order crossover study versus usual care insulin pump without remote monitoring hypoglycemia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Monitoring Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The rationale study measure safety eliminate glycemic monitoring investigator do previous outpatient study insulin bihormonal bionic pancreas control . The investigator plan transition outpatient study integrate bionic pancreas , iLet , near future . The intend use device include remote monitoring , would feasible commercial scale . Therefore , trial investigator test effect hypoglycemia eliminate blood glucose related monitoring . In addition , investigator perform pilot trial test effect bionic pancreas food intake , exercise , weight body composition . The primary purpose pilot assess feasibility perform measurement context large trial collect data use power sub-studies pivotal trial look outcomes . Finally , investigator test accuracy two new CGM device see sufficient accuracy provide glucose data bionic pancreas . If , would provide new option user may difficulties currently validate CGM purpose , Dexcom G4 AP / G5 platform .</detailed_description>

Acceptable contraception method include : Oral contraceptive pill ( OCP ) , Intrauterine Device ( IUD , hormonal copper ) , Male condom , Female condom , Diaphragm cervical cap spermicide , Contraceptive patch ( OrthoEvra ) , Contraceptive implant ( Implanon , Nexplanon ) , Vaginal ring ( NuvaRing ) , Progestin shot ( DepoProvera ) , Male partner vasectomy proven effective semen analysis Need go outside designate geographic boundary study Current alcohol abuse ( intake average &gt; 3 drink daily last 30 day ) , use marijuana within 1 month enrollment , substance abuse ( use within last 6 month control substance marijuana without prescription ) Unwilling unable refrain drink 2 drink hour 4 drink day use marijuana trial Unwilling unable avoid use drug may dull sensorium , reduce sensitivity symptom hypoglycemia , hind decision make period participation study ( use beta blocker allow long dose stable subject meet criterion hypoglycemia unawareness take stable dose , use benzodiazepine narcotic , even prescription , may exclude accord judgment principal investigator ) History liver disease expect interfere antihypoglycemia action glucagon ( e.g . liver failure cirrhosis ) . Other liver disease ( i.e . active hepatitis , steatosis , active biliary disease , tumor liver , hemochromatosis , glycogen storage disease ) may exclude subject cause significant compromise liver function may unpredictable fashion . Renal failure dialysis Personal history cystic fibrosis , pancreatitis , pancreatic tumor , pancreatic disease Any known history coronary artery disease include , limited , history myocardial infarction , stress test showing ischemia , history angina , history intervention coronary artery bypass grafting , percutaneous coronary intervention , enzymatic lysis presume coronary occlusion ) Abnormal EKG consistent coronary artery disease increase risk malignant arrhythmia include , limited , evidence active ischemia , prior myocardial infarction , proximal LAD critical stenosis ( Wellen 's sign ) , prolong QT interval ( &gt; 440 m ) . Nonspecific ST segment T wave change ground exclusion absence symptom history heart disease . A reassuring evaluation cardiologist abnormal EKG finding may allow participation . Congestive heart failure ( establish history CHF , low extremity edema , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , orthopnea ) History TIA stroke Seizure disorder , history nonhypoglycemic seizure within last two year , ongoing treatment anticonvulsant History hypoglycemic seizure ( grandmal ) coma last year History pheochromocytoma : fractionate metanephrines test patient history increase risk catecholamine secrete tumor : Episodic treatment refractory ( require 4 medication achieve normotension ) hypertension Paroxysms tachycardia , pallor , headache Personal family history MEN 2A , MEN 2B , neurofibromatosis , von HippelLindau disease History adrenal disease tumor Hypertension systolic BP ≥160 mm Hg diastolic BP ≥100 despite treatment Untreated inadequately treat mental illness ( indicator would include symptoms psychosis , hallucination , mania , psychiatric hospitalization last year ) , treatment antipsychotic medication know affect glucose regulation . Electrically powered implant ( e.g . cochlear implant , neurostimulators ) might susceptible RF interference The presence active implanted device Unable completely avoid acetaminophen duration study Unable completely avoid ascorbic acid ( Vitamin C ) duration study Unable completely avoid salicylic acid ( use pain reliever Aspirin skin care product ) History adverse reaction glucagon ( include allergy ) besides nausea vomit Established history allergy severe reaction adhesive tape must use study History eat disorder within last 2 year , anorexia , bulimia , diabulemia omission insulin manipulate weight History intentional , inappropriate administration insulin lead severe hypoglycemia require treatment Use oral ( e.g . thiazolidinediones , biguanides , sulfonylurea , glitinides , DPP4 inhibitor , SGLT2 inhibitor ) antidiabetic medication Lives frequents area poor Verizon wireless network coverage ( would prevent remote monitor ) Any factor , opinion principal investigator would interfere safe completion study A condition prevent complicate placement , operation removal Senseonics sensor wear transmitter , include upper extremity deformity skin condition Currently receiving ( likely need study period ) : immunosuppressant therapy , chemotherapy , anticoagulant/antithrombotic therapy ( exclude aspirin ) , glucocorticoid ( exclude ophthalmic nasal ) . This include use inhale topical glucocorticoid antibiotic chronic infection A condition require likely require magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , Computed Tomography ( CT ) scan , highfrequency electrical heat ( diathermy ) A know topical local anesthetic allergy A known glucocorticoid allergy The presence CGM sensor transmitter locate upper arm ( location acceptable ) Hemoglobin &lt; 12 g/dl</criteria>
