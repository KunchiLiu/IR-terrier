	<detailed_description>Introduction Despite increase use patient-controlled anesthesia ( PCA ) postoperative pain management , effort continue find effective method relieve pain abdominal surgery . Some study already suggest infusion local anesthetic wound site decrease postoperative pain level . Further , study show equal amount opiate analgesic requirement ( administer patient demand ) placebo local anesthetic administration . However , vary anesthetic administration technique use different study may explain controversy literature exist . Although opioid effective analgesic opioid related adverse event ( ORAEs ) . Bupivacaine reduce postoperative pain relatively short duration action . Liposome bupivacaine ( Exparel ) approve single dose infiltration longer postoperative period analgesic . It provide 72 hour analgesia postoperatively ; result lesser opioids usage reduce ORAEs . Transversus abdominis plane ( TAP ) block relatively new regional anesthetic technique target blockage neural afferent low intercostal , iliohypogastric ilioinguinal nerve neurovascular plane internal oblique transversus abdominis muscle . TAP block perform reduce opioid use control pain several laparoscopic surgical procedure , include colorectal resection , cholecystectomy bariatric surgery . Efficacy wound infiltration without TAP block use immediate-release bupivacaine HCl acute postsurgical pain well establish ; EXPAREL propose method postoperative pain management . Moreover , administration optimal dosage bariatric surgical population study . The objective study examine postoperative pain laparoscopic gastric bypass TAP block port sit infiltration use Exparel versus Bupivacaine Background significance Exparel FDA approve long-acting , local anesthetic . This single-dose infiltration surgical site produce postsurgical analgesia . Exparel offer longer-acting local formulation administer single dose . Exparel long duration action slow absorption . The mean elimination half-life local administration Exparel approximately 24-34 hour 19-20 versus 2.7 hour bupivacaine . Liposomal bupivacaine single-dose infiltration recommend dose depends surgical site maximum dose liposomal bupivacaine 266 mg inject soft tissue surgical site frequent aspiration prevent intravascular injection . A pooled analysis evaluate effect Exparel pain intensity score opioid consumption publish Dasta et al . This study include 5 surgical procedure ( inguinal hernia repair , total knee replacement , hemorrhoidectomy , breast augmentation bunionectomy ) compare Exparel bupivacaine HCl , 912 patient ; show significantly low pain score opioid usage , delay use rescue opioid reduce ORAEs Exparel group ; compare bupivacaine HCL group . Medication SafetLiposomal bupivacaine classify high-alert medication Institute Safe Medication Practices due similar appearance propofol . If liposomal bupivacaine administer intravenously propofol , adverse cardiac effect may result . Hypothesis Exparel ( 1.3 % ) 0.5 % Bupivacaine usage infiltration TAP block decrease opiate usage , nausea pain 48 hour compare 0.5 % Bupivacaine . Primary Objective study : To study opiate usage , pain nausea post laparoscopic gastric bypass sleeve gastrectomy use EXPAREL versus Bupivacaine TAP block port sit infiltration .</detailed_description>
