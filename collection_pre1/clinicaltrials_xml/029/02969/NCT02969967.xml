	<brief_title>Effectiveness Dynamic Wrist-hand Orthosis Early Outpatient Rehabilitation Upper Extremity Post Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although intensive repetitive use paretic upper extremity show improve upper extremity outcomes post stroke , therapeutic approach allow moderate severe upper extremity impairment independently participate repetitive grasp release activity . The SaeboFlex orthosis dynamic wrist-hand orthosis assist finger thumb extension functional grasping paretic hand therefore may allow affected upper extremity post stroke participate repetitive grasp release activity otherwise would unable . More research require effectiveness orthosis improve upper extremity recovery post stroke especially use home continuation therapy receive inpatient rehabilitation . It suggest guide home rehabilitation program improve ability stroke survivor independent activity daily live . This study mix method study combine quantitative single subject ABA design qualitative post study individual interview first capture quantitative information effectiveness SaeboFlex intervention qualitative information build explain quantitative data . Three participant use SaeboFlex orthosis part upper extremity rehabilitation program recruit inpatient stroke rehabilitation unit discharge inpatient rehabilitation see principal investigator home 1 hour 3 time week 2 week week 6 week wait list outpatient occupational therapy service . The intervention follow set protocol grasp-release activity use SaeboFlex orthosis 50 minute least 3 time per week , follow 10 minute grasp-release activity without orthosis , grade provide optimal upper extremity challenge throughout intervention period . Repeated baseline assessment complete trained research assistant , participant ' home , within one week discharge inpatient stroke rehabilitation repeat 4 8 week intervention , follow individual interview participant ' home .</detailed_description>
