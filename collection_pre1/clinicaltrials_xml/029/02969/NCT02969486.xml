	<brief_summary>Pulmonary hypertension ( PH ) condition characterize sustained elevation pulmonary artery pressure ( PAP ) 25 mmHg assess right heart catheterization . PH fatal absence adequate treatment therapy , condition progressively increase workload right heart ultimately lead failure . With minimal indicative prevalence 1 case/300 , PH affect least 25'000 people Switzerland alone . After initiation PH therapy , follow-up patient 's health status often limit punctual PAP measurement clinic interval several month . The lack frequent measurement patient 's PAP strongly hinder identification short-term trend pulmonary hemodynamics , therefore anticipation worsen condition treatment inefficiency . As possible solution , wireless implantable hemodynamic monitor CardioMEMSTM HF System ( CardioMEMS Inc. , Atlanta , USA ) recently introduce continuous monitoring PAP patient PH . The benefit frequent measurement intermittent clinic visit demonstrate several previous study , notably term prediction therapy outcome , anticipation worsen heart failure , feedback rapidity therapy , decline hospitalization rate . Nevertheless , despite undeniable advantage implantable monitor offer patient , remain highly invasive solution . In contrast , noninvasive alternative measurement PAP exist , transthoracic echocardiography , impractical frequent PAP assessment due dependency qualify personnel perform measurement . An optimal PAP monitoring modality patient PH non-invasive ( free risk complication associate cardiac catheterization ) unsupervised ( able operate without supervision medical doctor ) . Such modality currently exist . In present study , investigator propose investigate potential novel non-invasive , continuous unsupervised PAP monitoring approach base pulse wave velocity ( PWV ) principle use electrical impedance tomography ( EIT ) .</brief_summary>
