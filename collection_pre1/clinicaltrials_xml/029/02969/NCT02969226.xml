	<brief_summary>Background : The sick patient admit intensive care unit ( ICU ) often require assistance breathing . When patient start get good , gradually breathe machine less—this call weaning . Although ventilator use save life , long use , complication occur . Clinicians aim wean patient ventilator timely safe manner . In ICUs , patient screen ( look ) per day see ready undergo wean test ( use variety technique ) see breathe tube remove . Screening per day may allow wean test conduct . Knowing best way wean test important method may better determine breathe tube remove safely . At present , n't know best way help sickest patient wean ventilator . Patients : Adults North American ICUs ventilator least 24 hour take breath . Interventions : Patients study receive one type screen one type wean test random . In 'once daily ' screening group , clinician screen patient morning . In 'two time daily screen ' group , patient screen morning , afternoon , whenever else clinicians wish screen . When screen criterion meet , patient undergo one two wean test low ventilator support support . Outcomes : The main outcome study time patient successfully remove ventilator . Relevance : For patient , study clarify best way remove ventilator timely safe manner . For clinician health care system , study hold promise improve critically ill patient wean breathe machine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Frequency Screening SBT Technique Trial : The FAST Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Goals 1 . To identify best strategy wean patient ventilator . 2 . To fully engage patient family member ( PFM ) trial . Rationale : Nearly 40 % time invasive ventilation spend wean . In minimize patient ' exposure invasive ventilation , clinician challenge trade-off complication associate protracted ventilation risk [ ventilator-associated pneumonia ( VAP ) , mortality ] premature , fail attempt extubation . Although randomized trial conduct evaluate different screening practice spontaneous breathe trial ( SBT ) technique , trial small , predated daily screening , limited generalizability North American ( NA ) context wean involves respiratory therapist ( RTs ) physician . In systematic review 17 trial ( n=2,434 ) , find screening protocol , compare usual care , associate 26 % reduction total duration ventilation , 70 % reduction weaning time , 11 % reduction ICU stay . Only 1 trial ( n=385 ) compare twice daily screen usual care find patient screened twice daily spend significantly less time ventilator . Once daily screen poorly align continuous care ICU environment . In international survey , Pressure Support ( PS ) positive end-expiratory pressure ( PEEP ) T-piece commonly use SBT technique . Concerns exist PS T-piece SBTs may underestimate , respectively , patient ' ability breathe extubation . Only 1 trial ( n=484 ) compare T-piece PS SBTs find difference outcomes . This trial conduct Europe , predate daily screening , underpowered . Design : The investigator conduct factorial design trial involve 760 patient 20 NA ICUs . Population : The investigator enroll critically ill adult receive invasive ventilation &gt; 24 hour initiate trigger breath commonly use wean mode . Comparators : Patients randomize undergo screening frequency ( vs. least twice daily ) AND SBT technique ( T-piece vs. PS ± PEEP ) . Outcomes : The primary outcome time successful extubation . Secondary outcome include general ventilation-specific outcome important citizen . We expect frequent screening , regardless SBT technique , reduce time successful extubation . This trial identify best strategy reduce time patient spend ventilator ICUs , clarify best weaning practice , enhance care delivery , launch new paradigm engagement research .</detailed_description>
