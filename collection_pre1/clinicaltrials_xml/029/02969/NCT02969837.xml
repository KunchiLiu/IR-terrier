	<detailed_description>Primary Objective • The primary efficacy endpoint rate sCR and/or rate negative MRD next generation gene sequence ( NGS ) clonoSIGHT ( Adaptive Biotechnologies ) end 8 cycle among non-transplant candidate transplant candidate agree defer transplant Secondary Objectives - To evaluate safety tolerability elotuzumab combination KRd , administer subject newly diagnose multiple myeloma . - To determine rate MRD next generation gene sequence ( NGS ) clonoSIGHT ( Adaptive Biotechnologies ) multi-color flow cytometry ( MFC ) end Cycle 4 , 8 , 12 subject , end C18 ( subject MRD+ end C8 MRD- end C12 ) , 24 month C1D1 , yearly . - To estimate time event , include duration response ( DOR ) , progression-free survival ( PFS ) , time progression ( TTP ) , overall survival ( OS ) . Exploratory Objectives - GEP , proteomics , gene sequence evaluate correlation treatment outcome pre-treatment subject profile . - Immunologic correlative study include FcγRIIIa V genotype .</detailed_description>
