	<brief_summary>The relevance study give feasibility ass effect intervention program base postural control trunk neuromuscular activity , compare two method : stabilization exercise vs. back strengthen exercise , athlete low back pain . The main outcome compute electromyography measurement ass trunk neuromuscular activation pattern well force platform parameter determine postural control . Clinical symptom pain intensity , perception disability fear avoidance also compute . This first study compare two intervention method use main biological outcome related trunk neuromuscular function .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Postural Control Trunk Neuromuscular Activation Athletes With Chronic Low Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For study , proposal 8-week intervention program carry lumbar stabilization exercise back strengthening exercise , 40 athlete chronic low back , recruit convenience voluntary community local sport center . Before intervention , participantes evaluate : electromoyography back endurance strength test , balance performance , physical capacity , clinical outcome pain , disability psychological factor . All baseline test evaluation perform blinded evaluator study intervention . Afterwards , participant randomize two group blind evaluator ( people enrol study ) : G1 : exercise lumbar stabilization ; G2 : strengthening exercise . The intervention follow 8 week , 30-60 minute duration session therapy include measurement blood pressure , heart rate Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) session , perception exercise intensity monitor Borg Scale . Within proposal , exercise session perform twice week . The intervention follow CONSORT recommendation randomize controlled trial . The intervention start : G1 ( n=20 , motor control group ) , perform therapy specific exercise lumbar stabilization include Swiss ball therapeutic resource ; G2 ( n=20 , strength group ) perform back endurance progressive resist exercise Roman chair . The participant blind study due characteristic exercise often reflect improvement symptom . In case eventual loss , intention-to-treat method use analysis . After intervention , group invite come back laboratory proceed evaluation baseline ( trunk activation exercise , balance , clinical outcome ) . For analysis two-way ANOVA repeat measure perform compare effect intervention ( two group ) time ( baseline vs. end 8-weeks measurement ) effect interaction ( Groups x Times ) . The size effect also compute determine rate change observe .</detailed_description>
