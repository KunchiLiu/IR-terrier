	<brief_summary>The objective present study compare effect liquid solid state food glycaemia , lipaemia insulinaemia . 25 participant age 21 45 year recruit general public Singapore . Fingerpricks cannulation may cause minor discomfort may slight bruise around site . Fingerpricks cannulation do experience research nurse train research officer minimize participant discomfort . If bruising occur , disappear within one day affect participant ' regular daily activity . Participants limit maximum one test per week . In addition , blood collection carry sterile designate area thus risk infection low . On rare occasion , participant may feel unwell test session . We several metabolic suite bed individual rest . The research nurse research officer monitor individual ' condition provide ride home require . All study food prepare hygienic manner purpose-built research kitchen maintain high hygiene standard . The research staff undergone basic training food hygiene procedure . Hence , risk infective acute gastroenteritis minimal . Participants provide snack end test session . They also reimburse compensate time cost associate travel parking completion study . In addition , participant provide blood glucose , blood pressure , body composition result , brief interpretation conclusion study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Design : This randomise , crossover study five session total . 1 . ) Instant rice porridge orange juice , 2 . ) Instant rice porridge palm oil , orange juice 3 . ) Instant rice porridge palm oleogel , orange juice 4 . ) Instant rice porridge liquid rice bran oil , orange juice 5 . ) Instant rice porridge rice bran oleogel , orange juice Study population : Healthy Chinese male ( BMI 18-25 kgm-2 ) body weight &gt; /=45 kg , age 21-45 year normal fast blood glucose ( &lt; 6.0 mM ) , recruit general public Singapore . The exclusion criterion people major chronic disease heart disease , cancer diabetes mellitus , glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase ( G-6-PD ) deficiency , glucose intolerance , intolerance allergy test product , well individual take insulin drug know affect glucose metabolism . People major medical surgical event require hospitalization within precede 3 month , individual presence disease drug influence digestion absorption nutrient , people therapeutic diet/ drug therapy smoker exclude . Screening visit : During screen session , participant receive inform consent form give ample time go rectify query . If decide take part study , ask sign inform consent form . They ask complete screening questionnaire , baseline measurement include anthropometric measurement , blood pressure , physical activity level collect participant order determine eligibility . Body weight body composition measure use bioelectrical impedance analysis . Height measure use stadiometer order calculate participant ' BMI . Blood pressure also measure . All measurement take duplicate . Participants schedule 5 subsequent test visit . The screening visit take approximately 1 hour . Screening questionnaire : The screening questionnaire include contact information , demographic , general health detail , physical activity level . This information use determine whether participant eligible study , well check possible confounders may influence study outcome . Physical activity level measure use previously validate international physical activity questionnaire . Meal composition : The test meal consist cook oil ( palm oil rice bran oil either liquid gel form make ethylcellulose ) , orange juice commercially available instant porridge . Test visit : During test session , participant ' glycaemic , insulinaemic , lipaemic response test meal measure . Participants ' metabolic satiety test meal also assess regular interval throughout test session . The test duration treatment 6.5 hour test session take place least 1 week apart . Subjects instruct avoid strenuous physical activity least 3 day avoid caffeine alcohol consumption least 1 day prior visit CNRC study trial . Participants ask standardise diet refrain alcohol exercise day test session . At begin test session , cannula insert participant ' arm . One fast blood sample collect fingerprick venous cannulation . A drop blood collect HemoCue® cuvette ( Helsingborg , Sweden ) blood glucose analysis . In addition , 5 milliliter venous blood collect Vacutainers® ( Belton Dickinson Diagnostics ) contain disodium EDTA analyse plasma triglyceride , insulin non-esterified fatty acid concentration . Participants consume treatment meal within 10 minute . Blood sample take baseline , 10 , 20 , 30 , 45 , 60 , 90 , 120 , 150 180 , 210 , 240 , 270 , 300 , 330 360 minute . The amount blood collect every time point approximately 5 mL . A maximum 16 blood sample collect fingerprick cannulation . A total 400mL approximately blood take study . Glycaemic , insulinaemic , lipaemic response determine use method describe Wolever Jenkins . The area curve determine area increment baseline . Participants also ask rate 'liking ' test meal . Participants rate 'overall like ' test meal 100 mm VAS anchor 'dislike extremely ' ( 0 mm ) , 'neither like dislike ' ( 50 mm ) 'like extremely ' ( 100 mm ) immediately consume test meal . Metabolic satiety : On test session day , participant ask record appetite rating 100 mm visual analogue scale ( VAS ) immediately consume test meal , every 30 minute interval peak change usually observe 15-30 minute test meal , base previous studies.. The appetite-rating questionnaire include question hunger , desire eat , prospective consumption , fullness , preoccupation thought food .</detailed_description>
