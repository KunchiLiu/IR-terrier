	<brief_summary>The primary objective study evaluate effectiveness interferon-free direct acting antiviral ( IFN-free DAAs ) treatment chronic hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) among patient opioid-substitution treatment ( OST ) . We hypothesize rate sustain virological response comparable non-OST population . Secondary objective include evaluation safety data , patient ` adherence patient report outcome measure like function ( disability ) , satisfaction treatment , health status , general health perception health-related quality life .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Interferon-free Antiviral Treatment Chronic Hepatitis C Virus Infection Among Opioid-substituted Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The new interferon-free antiviral regimen treatment chronic hepatitis C ( CHC ) infection achieve impressive sustained virological response ( SVR ) rate beyond 90 % , short treatment duration reduce side effect , irrespective previous treatment history presence advance liver disease . In Europe , majority HCV infection acquire transmitted inject drug use - therefore , people inject drug ( PWID ) represent majority individual CHC infection Western industrialize culture . There excellent therapeutic option PWID OST , frequent treatment provider-patient contact allow regular diagnosis , continue monitoring , sustainable management HCV-infection among patient . However , despite grow evidence patient OST successfully treat HCV , treatment uptake among predominant risk group still low . The current evidence non-drug use population limited impact willingness physician provide opioid substitution treatment ( OST ) , hepatologists infectiologists provide antiviral HCV treatment IFN-free DAAs willingness OST patient enter treatment . Accordingly , data effectiveness safety antiviral HCV treatment regimens IFN-free DAAs among relevant patient group urgently need . The aim prospective cohort study ass effectiveness , safety patient report outcome measure IFN-free DAAs treatment CHC among OST patient . The primary objective open-label , observational , prospective cohort study evaluate effectiveness IFN-free DAAs regimens treatment chronic HCV-infection among OST patient real life clinical setting . Patients treat chronic HCV kind register IFN-free DAA protocol accordance respective SmPC . This ensure dose schedule support Phase I later research . The study physician make medical decision regard type medication dos . The individual treatment duration depend respective treatment protocol . The study physician responsible medical decision document treatment dosage , treatment schedule , treatment duration outcome . Effectiveness define sustained virological response week 12 week 24 end treatment ( SVR12 SVR24 ) . SVR rate compare literature non-substance use population basis two-sided 95 % confidence interval . The sample size calculation reveal , 295 OST patient ( HCV treatment na√Øve/Non-responder/Relapser ) eligible treatment IFN-free DAAs ( accord summary product ( SmPC ) ) include . To account dropout , consider over-recruitment 10 % , result 325 patient recruit . Secondary objective include collection safety data treatment phase SVR12 , patient ` adherence , patient report outcome measure like function ( disability ) , satisfaction treatment , health status , general health perception health-related quality life . All analyse - effectiveness safety - conduct intention-to-treat ( ITT ) well per protocol ( PP ) analyse . The ITT sample define number patient start treatment ( first dose ) , whereas PP sample include patient complete data SVR24 .</detailed_description>
