	<brief_title>Treatment Strategy Stage IV Gastric Cancer With Positive Peritoneal Cytology Only Non-curable Factor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In 7th AJCC/UICC TNM stag system , gastric cancer positive peritoneal cytology ( CY+ ) define stage IV disease . In NCCN clinical practice guideline , suggest positive peritoneal cytology absence visible peritoneal implant consider M1 disease surgery initial treatment recommend patient positive peritoneal cytology . However , Japanese gastric cancer treatment guideline 2014 , suggest standard gastrectomy propose patient non-curative factor CY+ status reveal surgery , postoperative treatment S-1 recommend tentative standard . Previous study also prove extensive intraperitoneal lavage ( EIPL ) Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy ( HIPEC ) effective method treatment peritoneal metastasis . In order optimize treatment strategy part patient , trial design compare effectiveness 2 treatment strategy .</detailed_description>
