	<brief_summary>The investigator plan use functional neuroimaging ( fMRI ) understand brain system affect hypnosis hypnotic analgesia augment repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) , form non-invasive brain stimulation 100 people fibromyalgia , chronic pain condition . The investigator measure effect rTMS- augmentation brain network underlie hypnotizability , well effect rTMS-augmentation hypnotic analgesia network . The investigator hope demonstrate combination psychological neuromodulatory treatment effective hypnosis alone , thereby enhance depth hypnosis , range hypnosis efficacy hypnotic analgesia hopefully create new treatment modality individual suffer pain syndrome fibromyalgia pain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Augment Hypnotic Analgesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Overall Study Design . The investigator propose develop combinatory approach integrative technique ( hypnosis ) augment neurotechnology ( repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ) . This application seek utilize previously establish brain-based mechanism hypnosis repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation biomarkers assess potential synergistic mechanism combinatory approach . 100 low-moderately hypnotizable subject fibromyalgia identify . The subject ' response rTMS-augmentation hypnosis measure . The volunteer randomize active sham rTMS . Two scan session perform subject , first scan session investigate effect rTMS-augmentation hypnosis hypnotizability ( 120 min scan session ) second scan session focus effect rTMS-augmented hypnotic analgesia ( 120 min scan session ) . The intent first scan session measure effect rTMS trait hypnotizability state hypnosis . The investigator assess change functional connectivity DLPFC dACC connectivity two brain region suggest neuroimaging surrogate hypnotizability . The first scan session also involve hypnosis assessment allow determination effect rTMS directly hypnosis . The second scan session intend assess effect active rTMS-augmented hypnotic analgesia hypnotic analgesia network . Additionally , effect rTMS- augmentation hypnotic analgesia pain threshold assess compare pre-rTMS augmentation baseline . Experimental design . Subjects ask refrain take analgesic medication 24 hour prior . Before MRI scan session , participant undergo preparation session , hypnotizability psychological testing conduct . At time , thermal pain training , determination laser threshold also do . Volunteer subject participate 2 MRI scan session two separate day , last approximately 120 min . Session 1 ( rTMS-augmented hypnosis session ) consist 4 control condition follow post-treatment assessment . Session 2 ( rTMS-augmented hypnotic analgesia ) consist 3 experimental condition follow post-treatment assessment . Baseline Mood , Cognitive , Health Assessments The follow assessed screening/consent : Numeric Rating Scale ( NRS ) The Hypnotic Induction Profile ( HIP ) Hypnosis Intensity Scale ( HIS ) TASS 2010 Fibromyalgia Diagnostic Criteria Antidepressant Treatment History Form The Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview ( MINI ) Edinburgh Handedness Inventory The Opioid Risk Tool The Brief Pain Inventory Ishihara Test ( ? ) MRI Safety Screening Form Ishihara Color Vision Test Participants ( n=100 ) randomize active ( n=50 ) versus sham ( n=50 ) rTMS undergo MRI scan two day ( Session 1 Session 2 ) . There four condition Session 1 three condition Session 2 . Session 1 : The first session address Aim 1 . Participants receive Hypnotic Induction Profile prior scan . Participants receive 1 ) [ Session 1 ] baseline scan , whereby high-resolution anatomical image collect . This follow 10-minute resting-state fMRI scan , whereby participant instruct close eye , think anything particular , refrain repetitive thought count . Next participant receive 2 ) [ Session 1 ] baseline scan hypnosis participant receive hypnotic induction subject scanner though use headphone pre-recorded induction script . Hypnotic instruction standardize , involve simple induction instruction use prior research brain signature hypnotic state clinical care . 3 ) [ Session 1 ] Next participant receive Hypnotic Intensity Profile ass baseline hypnotic depth . 4 ) [ Session 1 ] rTMS session occur baseline scan consist 40 second cTBS follow 15 min spacing follow 40 second cTBS previously describe . The stimulation deliver 80 % motor threshold . 5 ) [ Session 1 ] Post rTMS baseline scan perform participant receive rTMS # 5 receive post rTMS scan . 6 ) [ Session 1 ] The study proceed rTMS-augmented hypnosis participant place scanner hypnotic induction scan active hypnosis . Hypnosis induce subject scanner use headphones pre-recorded induction script . Hypnotic instruction standardize , involve simple induction instruction use prior research brain signature hypnotic state . The participant repeat Hypnotic Intensity Scale inside scanner well Hypnotic Induction Profile outside scanner . Finally , participant ask whether believe receive active sham rTMS . There least week first scan second scan wash effect . Session 2 : The participant return receive pain threshold testing . The participant receive 1 ) [ Session 1 ] baseline scan ( similar ) . 2 ) [ Scan Session 2 ] Next , baseline scan pain condition , participant passively experience rate laser pain . In condition , laser stimulation deliver different area two distinct temperature . The temperature correspond participant 's heat-pain threshold ( HPTpre ) ( i.e. , temperature elicits pain intensity rating `` 1 '' NRS ) suprathreshold ( i.e. , temperature participant give pain intensity rating 5/10 , NRS ) . 3 ) [ Session 2 ] rTMS-augmented hypnotic analgesia . The participant read script include suggestion relate hypnotic analgesia . 22 painful laser stimulation deliver two run , participant ask rate pain intensity unpleasantness . Participants also rate pain intensity unpleasantness condition . 4 ) [ Session 2 ] rTMS session describe . Participants also rate pain intensity unpleasantness condition determine analgesic effect rTMS alone analgesia . 5 ) [ Session 2 ] Post rTMS baseline scan perform manner . 6 ) [ Session 2 ] rTMS-augmented hypnotic analgesia . The participant read script include suggestion relate hypnotic analgesia . 22 painful laser stimulation deliver two run , participant ask rate pain intensity . Specifics : rTMS administration . Using single pulse TMS scalp position low motor threshold determine . Subjects randomly assign receive active DLPFC rTMS ( n=50 ) sham rTMS ( n=50 ) . The investigator perform 40 second continuous theta-burst stimulation ( cTBS ) form rTMS follow 15 min spacing follow 40 second cTBS previously describe . The standardized treatment DLPFC location leave dorsolateral prefrontal cortex determine Localite Neuronavigation target posterior middle frontal gyrus . The baseline structural scan obtain scan 1 utilized localization process . Sham rTMS neuronavigation target method . SHAM : Both active sham DLPFC rTMS receive simulation specially design coil , Cool-B65 AP Butterfly coil . This coil capable deliver either active rTMS sham rTMS manner , randomized system therefore blind treater . The sham set coil look sound similar active setting , hidden aluminum plate block actual stimulation . Hypnosis induction procedure . Hypnosis induce subject scanner though use headphone pre-recorded induction script . Hypnotic instruction standardize , involve simple induction instruction use prior research brain signature hypnotic state clinical care . The ability enter maintain hypnotic state induction mechanism fMRI environment previously demonstrate . Pain induction assessment procedure . For pain task , participant passively experience rate laser stimuli apply different region dorsum fingers/hands use 0-10 numerical rating scale ( NRS ) . Ratings make pain intensity pain unpleasantness.. Decreased pain rating determine strength analgesic effect treatment . Subjects ask rate laser-evoked pain follow stimulus scan . They separately ask rate fibromyalgia-related pain scan use scale . Physiologic data acquisition : Throughout scan procedure monitor peripheral autonomic physiology use MRI compatible EKG lead chest belt monitor respiration . This allow u compute respiratory sinus arrhythmia , provide good estimate vagal tone , , turn , associate well cardiac health self-soothing . Customized algorithm develop Stanford simultaneous fMRI/EEG remove MRI scanner artifact EKG trace apply .</detailed_description>
