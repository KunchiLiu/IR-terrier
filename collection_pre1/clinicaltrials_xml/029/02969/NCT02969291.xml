It known exercise intervention effective increase physical activity level breast cancer survivor . Knowing breast cancer survivor less active non-cancer patient , less active lifestyle place risk obesity poor overall health , turn also increase risk cancer cancer recurrence . Not reason risk reduction clear , however know hormone inflammatory marker play role . This study three goal : 1 . To investigate feasibility home intervention design reduce sedentary behavior . 2 . Describe effect intervention level sedentary behavior , physical activity , symptom . 3 . Assess cost intervention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There well-documented association physical activity risk breast cancer development recurrence . Exercise training intervention effective increase physical activity level breast cancer survivor , however require 1 ) large degree patient initiative achieve positive health outcome associate sustained behavioral change 2 ) facility oversight may prohibitive clinical setting . Although activity-based research date focus increase level moderate vigorous physical activity ( MVPA ) breast cancer survivor , large epidemiological study suggest breast cancer survivor also sedentary compare non-cancer control . A recent meta-analysis control intervention trial design promote physical activity among sedentary cancer survivor find none trial within scope review succeed achieve 75 % good adherence prescribe exercise guideline , lead author question whether shift target intervention MVPA reduction sedentary time might realistic goal . Recent research suggest intervention design reduce sedentary time breast cancer survivor potential yield clinically meaningful health benefit , especially individual high risk sedentary behavior , however optimal method intervention clear . Aim 1 : Feasibility intervention Assess feasibility intervention design reduce sedentary behavior breast cancer survivor . The behavioral intervention involve review 7-day baseline snapshot sedentary behavior physical activity pattern , combine tailored activity prompt describe follow 6 week . Aim 2 : Effects intervention Aim 2a : Describe preliminary range effect size intervention level sedentary behavior , physical activity symptom cancer survivorship ( e.g . cancer related fatigue ) . Aim 2b : Evaluate relationship change sedentary behavior change cancer-relevant outcome , fatigue biomarkers cancer recurrence ( e.g . IGF-1 , Leptin ) , follow reduce sedentary time intervention . Aim 3 : Assessment intervention component Aim 3a : Quantitatively ass overall cost intervention individual component , dose deliver dose receive intervention participant Aim 3b : Quantitatively describe intervention participant ' perspective impact individual intervention component , include component appear useful reduce sedentary time .</detailed_description>
