	<brief_summary>The aim study evaluate effect shorten etch time 18-month clinical performance resin composite restoration primary molar partial carious removal . This randomized clinical trial include subject ( 5-10 year-old child ) select Pediatric Clinic Federal University Santa Maria . The sample consist 70 primary molar present active cavitated carious lesion ( radiographic involvement outer half dentin ) , locate occlusal surface . The sample randomly divide two group accord etch time dentin prior adhesive application ( Adper Single Bond 2 ; 3M ESPE ) : recommend manufacturer ( 15 second ) half-reduced etching time ( 7 second ) . The restoration clinically follow every 6 month 18-month use FDI criterion clinical evaluation . Survival estimate restoration longevity evaluate use Kaplan-Meier method .</brief_summary>
