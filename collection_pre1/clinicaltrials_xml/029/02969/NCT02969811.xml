Patients commonly receive blood transfusion reduce risk myocardial ischaemia improve perfusion organ ( e.g . kidney ) , treatment may important adverse effect include postoperative infection . Patients undergo surgery fracture neck femur often elderly , co-morbidities high risk postoperative complication , include MI AKI . We propose conduct study follow aim : 1 . To describe incidence anaemia transfusion patient undergo surgery fracture neck femur . 2 . To use clinical biochemical data measure incidence perioperative cardiac kidney injury group . 3 . To evaluate highly sensitive serum troponin urinary MALDI-MS possible endpoint future prospective randomise trial perioperative transfusion .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Blood transfusion expensive finite resource optimum transfusion threshold surgical patient yet define . Patients commonly receive blood transfusion reduce risk myocardial ischaemia improve perfusion organ ( e.g . kidney ) , treatment may important adverse effect include postoperative infection . There great interest restrictive transfusion practice ( e.g . transfusion trigger 70 g L-1 ) , however patient co-existing cardiovascular disease exclude study restrictive versus liberal transfusion strategy . Highly sensitive troponin assay available , allow clinician reliably detect cardiac injury increase number patient undergone major surgery . Troponin release surgery common , high 40 % study . Patients undergo surgery fracture neck femur often elderly , co-morbidities high risk postoperative complication , include MI AKI . We propose conduct study follow aim : 1 . To describe incidence anaemia transfusion patient undergo surgery fracture neck femur . 2 . To use clinical biochemical data measure incidence perioperative cardiac kidney injury group . 3 . To evaluate highly sensitive serum troponin urinary MALDI-MS possible endpoint future prospective randomise trial perioperative transfusion .</detailed_description>
