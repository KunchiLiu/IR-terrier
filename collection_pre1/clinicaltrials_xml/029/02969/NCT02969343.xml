	<brief_title>Patient Safety Learning Laboratory : Making Acute Care More Patient-Centered</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Brigham Women 's Hospital ( BWH ) Patient Safety Learning Laboratory ( PSLL ) develop system approach integrate health information technology ( HIT ) , stakeholder engagement mechanism , process design/engineering method focus patient safety , development enhancement tool , health care system intervention , translation practice . The three technological toolkits develop part Patient Safety Learning Laboratory ( PSLL ) are:1 ) Patient-centered Fall Prevention Toolkit aim engage patient family caregiver design HIT tool prevent patient fall related injury acute hospitalization ; 2 ) Patient Safety Checklist Tool improve patient safety quality outcome , provider efficiency , team communication ; 3 ) MySafeCare Patient Safety Reporting System aim iteratively develop evaluate impact patient safety reporting system patient safety foster health system focus collaborative learning . The Brigham Women 's Patient Safety Learning Laboratory ( BWH PSLL ) establish vibrant learn ecosystem health service , informatics , system engineering researcher , collaborate patient family evolve apply approach adverse event prevention hospitalize patient . In addition , Systems Engineering , Usability , Integration ( SEUI ) Core leverage health system engineering approach develop provide system-wide methodology aid successful implementation improvement Health Information Technology ( HIT ) tool model know Patient SatisfActiveÂ® develop , test , refine create culture patient- family-centered care .</detailed_description>
