	<detailed_description>This propose study evaluate temporal change human cervical mucus response progesterone progestins initial step toward clarify relationship . Our hypothesis direct effect progesterone endocervix , independent estrogen withdrawal , cause contraceptive change cervical mucus . To study , randomize , prospective , crossover study conduct examine cervical mucus change small cohort woman investigator suppress circulate hormonal level administer GnRH antagonist . Investigators artificially replace Estrogen Progesterone order differentiate effect clinical laboratory measurement mucus quality . The investigator look closely immediate change mucus .35 mg norethindrone , market drug administer experimental setting . Cervical cell sample also collect various time point perform RT-PCR determine whether gene membrane bound progesterone receptor express regulated Estrogen Progesterone .</detailed_description>
