	<brief_summary>Sleep impairment reliably predict worsen chronic pain correlate visual analogue pain score . Therapies target improve sleep , include cognitive behavioral therapy , improve sleep quality also pain management , reduce interference pain daily activity . As effective pain relief decrease sleep disturbance , improvement sleep propose marker effective pain management . Hence useful evaluate sleep disturbance chronic pain population clinical research set . There many tool evaluate sleep quality ; routinely use simple brief pain inventory ( BPI ) single question sleep . We compare three dedicated sleep measure BPI patient chronic pain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chronic Pain Assessment Sleep</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prevalence sleep disturbance include insomnia high chronic pain patient know contribute maintenance chronic pain . A large survey estimate chronic pain moderate severe intensity occur 19 % adult Europeans , 50 % cohort report feeling tired time . Studies use specific sleep assessment tool find 50 % patient complain poor sleep 40 % clinically define insomnia . Though association sleep pain well establish , still unclear direction causality . A recent narrative review find sleep impairment reliably predict worsen chronic pain correlate high visual analogue pain score . Therapies target improve sleep hygiene , include cognitive behavioral therapy , show improve sleep quality , also pain management reduce degree pain interfere daily activity . As effective pain relief decrease sleep disturbance , improvement sleep propose marker effective pain management.8 Hence useful evaluate sleep disturbance chronic pain population clinical research set . There least 30 different sleep evaluation scale questionnaire . Previous work use several different tool quantify prevalence severity sleep disturbance chronic pain patient . The commonly used tool Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ( PSQI ) Medical Outcomes Study ( MOS ) Sleep Scale . The PSQI extensive body evidence detect primary insomnia , demonstrate high test-retest reliability contain domain importance measure sleep disturbance chronic pain . However , none aforementioned tool directly assess impact pain sleep , capable establish direct link sleep disturbance chronic pain . Chronic Pain Sleep Inventory ( CPSI ) Pain Sleep Questionnaires ( PSQ ) develop assess impact pain pain related sleep disturbance . These multidimensional item abbreviate Sleep Pain Index ( SPI ) Pain Sleep three-item index ( PSQ-3 ) specifically target assess sleep disturbance patient chronic pain . Both SPI PSQ- 3 test reliability validity . The Verran Snyder-Halpern ( VSH ) scale use visual analogue scale describe sleep quality , latency disturbance none questionnaires widely adopt either research setting clinical practice . Though reason know , people may find multi-items dedicated questionnaire cumbersome overwhelm . One way circumvent issue utilize single item questionnaire even use single item widely use pain questionnaire . Single item numerical rating scale measure sleep quality show modest correlation MOS sleep scale may particular benefit repeated measurement use due simple nature . Brief Pain Inventory ( BPI ) one widely use measurement tool advocate one core outcomes tool pain clinical trial . BPI provide overall picture pain status interference general health serf help monitor response treatment time . Included BPI single numerically rat score assess degree pain interfere sleep . This item potential detect impact pain pain related sleep disturbance thereby insomnia therefore lead treatment . Validation commonly use questionnaire BPI , formal sleep assessment tool would allow identification patient significant sleep disturbance facilitate prompt target treatment also help evaluate pain treatment .</detailed_description>
