	<criteria>Subjects age least national legal adult age . Subjects hemiparesis due acquire brain injury ( ABI ) present muscle overactivity impede motor function base investigator 's judgement include , limited , least one follow require botulinum neurotoxin ( BoNT ) treatment : typical clenched fist ; flexed wrist ; flexed elbow ; plantar flexed foot pattern . At least 12 month since ABI . Naïve nonnaïve BoNT treatment ; nonnaïve , least 4 month last BoNT injection , serotype . Upper limb active function overall score 2 7 , assess MFS , primary TT limb UL . A 10metre maximal WS barefoot 0.2 1.4 m/s , primary TT limb LL . Maximal WS barefoot perform without walk aid . However , cane may permit absolutely necessary ( although may prevent detection treatmentinduced improvement ) . In case , aid use WS assessment study . Subjects must provide write informed consent participate study prior studyrelated procedure . Female subject childbearing potential ( surgically sterile 2 year postmenopausal ) must use medically accept method contraception must agree continue use method duration study last visit subject least 12 week post injection . Acceptable method contraception include total abstinence , male partner vasectomy , double barrier method ( e.g . male condom plus spermicide , female diaphragm plus spermicide ) , intrauterine device , hormonal contraceptive ( oral , transdermal , implanted inject ) . Subjects must willing able comply study restriction remain clinic require duration study period willing return clinic followup evaluation specify protocol Inability understand protocol procedure requirement , , opinion investigator , could negatively impact protocol compliance , particularly inability exercise accord GSC . Previous surgery affect muscle ligament , tendon , nerve trunk , bone treat upper low limb . Previous treatment phenol and/or alcohol treat limbs time study . Any medical condition ( include severe dysphagia breathe difficulty ) may increase , opinion investigator , likelihood adverse event ( AEs ) relate BoNT A treatment . Current , plan receive within last 4 week prior study treatment , treatment drug interfere either directly indirectly neuromuscular function ( example , aminoglycosides ) . Major neurological impairment spastic paresis ( include major proprioceptive ataxia apraxia paretic side ) could negatively impact functional performance subject . Known disease neuromuscular junction ( LambertEaton myasthenic syndrome myasthenia gravis ) . Known sensitivity BoNTA excipient Dysport . Infection injection site ( ) . Current pregnancy lactation . A pregnancy test perform start study female subject childbearing potential ( i.e . surgically sterile 2 year postmenopausal ) . Mental condition render subject unable understand nature , scope possible consequence study and/or evidence uncooperative attitude . Abnormal baseline finding medical condition ( ) , opinion investigator , might jeopardise subject 's safety . Anticoagulant treatment international normalise ratio ( INR ) &gt; 3.5 within week prior injection . Subjects participate therapeutic clinical study/received investigational agent within 30 day enrolment .</criteria>
