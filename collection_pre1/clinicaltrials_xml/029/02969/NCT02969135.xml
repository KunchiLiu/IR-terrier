	<brief_summary>Shoulder disorder extremely common , life-time prevalence population 30 % . About 23 % work population shoulder problem sick-listed . Specifically rotator cuff tear consider principal cause chronic shoulder pain disability , especially advance age . The National Patient Register Denmark register 730 rotator cuff repair 2006 990 2012 , represent 35 % increase . A rotator cuff tear define rupture tendon ( ) shoulder , frequently involve supraspinatus and/or infraspinatus tendon , result loss function due pain tissue weakness . Little known effect postoperative training/rehabilitation , provide unclear picture total treatment procedure condition . The Danish National Clinical Guidelines 2013 recommend patient offer rehabilitation shoulder immobilize post-surgery , evidence postoperative train moderate- low . The past year , conduct 5 systematic review look different rehabilitation parameter rotator cuff surgery . They conclude early Range-Of-Motion exercise accelerate healing , reduce stiffness , increase risk re-rupture immobilization increase tendon heal clinical outcome . They also conclude need evaluate approach foster early initiation rehabilitation gradual introduction functional load high-quality , adequately powered trial , also consider key outcome return work . Therefore , aim study compare effect progressive early passive active movement protocol care usual ( limited early passive movement protocol ) tendon healing , physical function , pain , quality life , patient operate due traumatic full thickness rotator cuff tear Randomized Controlled Trial . Shortterm effect physical function , pain , quality life study primary patient report outcome , secondary outcomes clinical paraclinical outcome addition longterm effect physical function , pain , quality life .</brief_summary>
