	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess feasibility safety topical administration etanercept via AFL micropores psoriatic plaque patient mild moderate plaque-type psoriasis . While wide variety therapeutic innovation treat moderate-to-severe psoriasis ( account around 30 % case ) become available year , innovation topical therapy treat mild/localized psoriasis ( account around 70 % case ) . Given half patient respond adequately current standard care , topical application fix combination calcipotriole betamethasone , medical need well topical therapy . Etanercept use successfully treat moderate-to-severe plaque-type psoriasis child adult decade . Its standard route application subcutaneous injection . Different dose regimen use : 1 x 50 mg 2 x 50 mg per week well 1 x 25 mg 2 x 25 mg per week . Under regimen , etanercept well-established favorable long-term safety record , injection site reaction ( pain , swell ) frequently report side effect . However , rare serious side effect serious opportunistic infection result immune system inhibition common anti-TNF agent limit systemic use patient . For reason , localize topical alternative route administration would desirable . However , large molecular size chemical nature etanercept prevent cross epidermal barrier . A CE certify ablative fractional laser ( AFL ) device Er : YAG source use create micropores plaques allow local delivery etanercept directly psoriatic plaque .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Monocentric , observer partially-blinded Phase I study . In study , three similar plaque patient prospectively identify blind observer randomize unblinded investigator use eCRF one three study treatment : 1 . Standard care ( daily administration Daivobet® patient ) , 2 . Ablative fractional laser microporation + topical application etanercept 3 . Ablative fractional laser microporation alone . Over treatment period 8 week , patient return clinic twice weekly assessment three study plaque blind observer , follow administration treatment plaque assign AFL microporation without etanercept . Patients treat remain plaque Daivobet® daily basis . Although incompatibility AFL etanercept anticipate , first time etanercept administer topically via AFL micropores use AFL microporation device , study conduct two stage : Safety Stage consist first five patient Study Stage thirty patient . In Safety Stage study , three different plaque first 5 patient randomize administered respective treatment . Enrollment suspend 5th patient enrol permit data monitoring committee ( DMC ) review initial safety data first 5 patient reassess risk . Based review , DMC make one three recommendation : 1. continue study plan , 2. continue study adjustment study procedure , change laser parameter , frequency treatment concentration etanercept , 3. event extreme safety concern , terminate study . If option 1 recommend , study resume Study Stage ( Stage 2 ) , initial 5 patient begin treatment , plaque receive treatment previously randomize . Their treatment continue 8 week . Enrollment also resume continue additional 25 patient enrol . If DMC recommend option 2 , treatment enrollment resume describe adapt protocol submit approve relevant authority . If DMC recommend option 3 , study terminate . The Study Stage consist 2 period : screening period ( 2 week prior baseline assessment randomization ) treatment period ( first 5 patient : initially 1 set treatment , follow suspension treatment DMC review , 8 week treatment ; remain 25 patient : 8 week treatment depend plaque randomization , either daily Daivobet® biweekly AFL without etanercept ) .</detailed_description>
