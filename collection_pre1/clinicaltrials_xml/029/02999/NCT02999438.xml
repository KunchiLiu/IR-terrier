	<brief_summary>Frailty complex biologic syndrome diminish physiologic reserve lead decrease resistance stressor associate adverse health outcome . The syndrome well study adult quantify Fried criterion , comprise five components- slowness , weakness , self-reported exhaustion , shrinkage diminish physical activity . The concept frailty novel child . A study young adult childhood cancer survivor demonstrate increased incidence frailty population along increase risk morbidity mortality . This suggest frailty phenotype relevance outside geriatric age group . Pediatric patient single ventricle physiology , heart failure pulmonary artery hypertension- represent population significantly increase risk mortality , morbidity decrease quality life . Currently , patient monitor outpatient serial echocardiogram blood work give information end organ damage . But validate tool available measure global infirmity child . Better understand relevance applicability frailty pediatrics may allow identification vulnerable pediatric cardiac patient value optimize clinical management improve health outcome .</brief_summary>
