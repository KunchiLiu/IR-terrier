	<brief_summary>The present study examine effect Montmorency tart cherry juice FATMAX ( intensity elicit maximal fat oxidation ) exercise fat oxidation rate , body composition blood-based cardio-metabolic marker . Participants receive Montmorency tart cherry juice placebo random counterbalance order 20 day . Outcome variable measure immediately pre- post-supplementation 10 day onset supplementation . It hypothesise Montmorency tart cherry juice would increase fat oxidation exercise , reduce body fat percentage improve cardio-metabolic marker .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aims : ( 1 ) Examine whether tart cherry juice supplementation cycling exercise augments fat oxidation rate therefore play role weight management healthy active human participant . ( 2 ) To extrapolate finding study future biomedical health disease research . Methods : Random counterbalance , within-group , double-blind study design . Participants randomly allocate consume either cherry juice first placebo . Eleven recreationally active male female participant recruit . Participants consume 30ml Montmorency tart cherry juice concentrate mix 100ml water , twice daily 20 day . Participants underwent 14 day washout period trial . All participant instruct keep habitual intake polyphenols anthocyanins . Twenty-four hour exercise test session , participant consume similar meal time . Diet adherence monitor food diary . Participants attend test session follow overnight fast , test complete time morning avoid circadian variation . Preliminary testing conduct ascertain VO2max individual FATMAX , 4 day one hour pre-supplementation exercise test . VO2max re-assessed 4 day one hour post-supplementation exercise test determine change train status affect result . Testing occur baseline , 10 day onset supplementation 20 day supplementation . Exercise protocol consist 60min cycle pre-determined individual FATMAX . Continuous gas analysis heart rate monitor throughout . Substrate oxidation rate energy expenditure calculate use stoichiometric equation ( Jeukendrup Wallis , 2005 ) . During test session blood pressure body composition ( impedance ) measurements take baseline pre-exercise testing session . Resting metabolic rate ( indirect calorimetry ) assess baseline pre-exercise testing session . Serum blood sample obtain participant follow time point : baseline , pre-exercise post-exercise one hour submaximal exercise test , trial . The following marker analyse : Glucose , Lactate , Triglycerides , HDL , Total Cholesterol Total Antioxidant Status .</detailed_description>
