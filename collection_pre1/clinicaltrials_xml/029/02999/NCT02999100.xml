	<brief_summary>The study evaluate stable , dry-powder formulation oxytocin , goal reduce post-partum hemorrhage morbidity mortality resource poor setting . This study conduct assess safety tolerability inhale oxytocin , characterize drug level inhale ( IH ) oxytocin compare oxytocin administer standard care . Two group subject enrol . Group 1 enroll pregnant woman , randomize receive either IH intramuscular ( IM ) oxytocin active management third stage labour ( baby bear ) . Group 2 enroll non-pregnant woman childbearing potential , receive IH oxytocin intravenous ( IV ) oxytocin cross design two dosing session This group evaluate safety tolerability IH IV oxytocin .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>All Groups : Between 18 40 year age inclusive , time signing informed consent . Healthy determine investigator medically qualify designee base medical evaluation include medical history , physical examination , laboratory test require per protocol . Subject clinical chemistry haematology value within acceptable range population recruit abnormal clinical significance . A subject clinical abnormality laboratory parameter ( ) is/are specifically list inclusion exclusion criterion , outside reference range population study may include investigator consultation Medical Monitor ( require ) agree document find unlikely introduce additional risk factor interfere study procedure . Adequate peripheral venous access cannulation . Group 1 Only : Currently pregnant , uncomplicated pregnancy determine investigator designee . Estimated date delivery within 24 week screen . Planned spontaneous vaginal birth consider investigator low risk post partum hemorrhage ( PPH ) . Planned birth 37th 42nd week pregnancy . Women qualify oxytocin appropriate active management TSL agree active management . Group 2 Only : ECG normal , abnormal clinically significant . FEV1 &gt; 80 % predict . Systolic blood pressure &gt; =90 millimeter mercury ( mmHg ) . Body mass index ( BMI ) within range 18 32 Kilogram ( kg ) /square meter ( m^2 ) ( inclusive ) . SexFemale . Group 2 , Cohort A Only : A female subject eligible participate confirm pregnant screening Day 1 ( confirm negative serum urine human chorionic gonadotrophin [ hCG ] test ) , lactate , follow condition applies : Is reproductive potential agrees use combine estrogen progestogen oral contraceptive 3 month prior first dose study medication followup contact . This method contraception effective use consistently , correctly accordance product label . The investigator responsible ensure subject understand properly use method contraception Group 2 , Cohort B Only : A female subject eligible participate confirm pregnant screening Day 1 ( confirm negative serum urine hCG test ) , lactate , one follow condition applies : Is reproductive potential use nonhormonal contraceptive method 3 month prior first dose study medication followup contact . Would reproductive potential , undergone bilateral tubal ligation occlusion bilateral salpingectomy least 12 month prior first dose study medication . Is reproductive potential sex partner continue abstinent penilevaginal intercourse long term persistent basis , preferred usual lifestyle . Periodic abstinence ( e.g . calendar , ovulation , symptothermal , postovulation method ) withdrawal acceptable method contraception . These method contraception effective use consistently , correctly accordance product label . The investigator responsible ensure subject understand properly use method ( ) contraception . Of Note : Group 2 , Cohort B enrol woman reproductive potential agree use nonhormonal contraceptive method least one month prior receive study drug followup assessment . Although condom spermicide consider highly effective method contraception , risk receive study drug pregnancy minimal follow reason : Pregnancy test must negative screen first day dose . Dosing complete great 14 day start dose . Oxytocin well establish rapid halflife . If patient happen conceive time dosing , study drug would eliminate implantation would occur . All Groups : Capable give sign informed consent describe Protocol include compliance requirement restriction list consent form protocol . All Groups : Postmenopausal define gynaecological history . Chronic lung condition etiology include asthma , Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , emphysema , interstitial lung disease active Tuberculosis ( TB ) . Current chronic history liver disease , know hepatic biliary abnormality ( exception Gilbert 's syndrome asymptomatic gallstone ) . Blood pressure &gt; 140 systolic &gt; 90 diastolic . Group 1 Only : Females plan Caesarean Section . Females significant medical complication determine investigator . Group 2 Only : Currently breastfeed lactate . QT duration correct heart rate Fridericia 's formula ( QTcF ) &gt; 450 millisecond ( msec ) . Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) bilirubin &gt; 1.5 Upper Limit Normal ( ULN ) ( isolated bilirubin &gt; 1.5xULN acceptable bilirubin fractionate direct bilirubin &lt; 35 % ) . Subjects highlyactive symptomatic gynaecological disorder ( large symptomatic fibroid ) . All Groups : Prescription nonprescription drug approve investigator . Oxytocin reason ( include , limited , induction augmentation labour ) prior administration studyrelated oxytocin . History regular alcohol consumption within 6 month study define : An average weekly intake &gt; 14 unit . One unit equivalent 8 gram ( g ) alcohol : halfpint ( approximately 240 milliliter [ ml ] ) beer , 1 glass ( 125 ml ) wine 1 ( 25 ml ) measure spirit . Current smoker subject history smoking within 6 month screen , total pack year history &gt; 5 pack year . Confirmatory use via Smokerlyzer discretion local investigator , advise subject 's recent smoking history doubt . History sensitivity study medication , component thereof , history drug allergy , opinion investigator Medical Monitor , contraindicate participation ( e.g . allergy previous inhaler use ) . Participation another clinical trial , opinion investigator , jeopardize subject 's safety study outcomes . Where participation study would result donation blood blood product excess 500 mL within 56 day . The subject participate clinical trial receive investigation product within following time period prior first dose day current study : 30 day twice duration biological effect investigational product ( whichever longer ) . Exposure four new chemical entity within 12 month prior first dose day . Group 2 Only : Presence hepatitis B surface antigen positive hepatitis C antibody test result . A positive Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) antibody test . A positive prestudy drug abuse test ( explain diet approve concomitant medication ) . A positive alcohol breath test .</criteria>
