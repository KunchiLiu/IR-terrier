	<brief_summary>Upon collection , human oocytes fertilized culture blastocyst stage , follow transfer / cryopreservation . Culture medium system develop support step process . Although culture medium system try mimic natural environment , several component in-vivo situation present todayÂ´s medium . One component anti-oxidants may protect embryos damage reactive oxygen specie . This investigation aim compare blastocyst development use 2 different type culture medium system , one contain antioxidant . Patients least eight oocyte meet inclusion criterion include investigation . It prospective randomize multicenter study randomly divide oocyte two group assess parameter embryo development fertilization blastocyst formation day six . Embryos acceptable developmental characteristic transfer uterus cryopreserved later use . The investigation design superiority study compare utilization rate blastocyst per normally fertilize oocyte use medium system . In patient receive embryo transfer fresh treatment cycle , detection clinical pregnancy ultrasound 12 week gestation final endpoint investigation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adding Antioxidants Into Human Sequential Culture Media System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study objective : Study compare blastocyst development cohort oocyte use two different medium system , sequential G-Series medium versus sequential G-Series medium supplement antioxidant . Primary endpoint : Percentage good quality blastocyst ( GQB ) per fertilize oocyte day 5 . Secondary endpoint : Embryo development day 3 , 5 6 Embryo quality day 3 , 5 6 Total blastocyst formation ( day 5 day 6 ) Utilization rate ( embryo available transfer cryopreservation ) Biochemical pregnancy rate Implantation rate Clinical pregnancy rate Setup : Prospective oocyte sibling , superiority study MATERIALS AND METHODS Intervention : New type embryo culture medium use vitro culture human IVF embryo . Power analysis : The plan power analysis make together statistician , Nils-Gunnar Pehrsson . From retrospective data use simulation , intra individual SD difference % GQB two medium strategy estimate 32 % . In order find difference 8 % GQB two medium power 80 % pair T-test 128 couple need . Randomization : Couples enrol study oocyte pick ( day 0 ) . A minimum 8 cumulus-oocyte-complexes require participation . Stratified randomization oocytes couple performed . For couple oocyte number . These oocyte couple block ( two ) randomize two medium type ; A ( Traditional G-Series medium system = Control ) B ( G-Series medium system antioxidant = intervention ) . In group traditional culture perform . Allocation perform 1:1 ratio accord unique randomization list couple . Blinding : To minimize possible bias primary outcome ( GQB D5 ) embryologist perform morphological evaluation day 5/6 know group embryos belong . Both physician couple blind respect group embryo select transfer . IVF treatment procedure : A traditional IVF treatment perform include ovarian stimulation oocyte pick-up use standard method clinic . Embryo assessment day 3 accord Alpha/ESHRE consensus criterion day 5 accord Gardner score . Morphological score Embryo development morphology day 3 score base Alpha/ESHRE Consensus criterion . Blastocyst development morphology score accord publish score system blastocyst document individual photo blastocyst . Embryo &amp; Blastocyst scoring perform inverted microscope day 3 day 5 &amp; 6 , respectively . Blastocysts score equal high 3BB consider GQB . DOCUMENTATION All patient participate study document computerized CRF . This document contain study-specific relevant clinical laboratory data specific IVF cycle . STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Both Intention-to-Treat ( ITT ) population Per Protocol ( PP ) population define . Primary efficacy variable superiority study difference % GQB two medium type couple . Primary statistical analysis two-sided paired T-test regard mean difference % GQB Standard sequential culture medium Antioxidant medium ITT population . A two side 95 % confidence interval mean difference % GOB two medium calculate . All significance test two-sided conducted 5 % significance level .</detailed_description>
