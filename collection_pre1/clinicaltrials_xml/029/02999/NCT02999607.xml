	<brief_summary>With study able dose-dependently measure real-time glucose metabolism change non-invasively stimulate superficial part dlPFC , commonly use target therapeutic tDCS application . This provide insight tDCS capable change one reliable parameter brain metabolism .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Brain Glucose Metabolism During Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With study , able substantiate regional whole brain glucose metabolism affect tDCS , assess amount signal change relation different current measure difference glucose metabolism stimulation reactivity healthy subject depressive patient . The objective investigate change regional cerebral metabolic rate glucose ( rCMRglu ) brain transcranial direct current stimulation healthy subject depressive patient . The design cross-sectional proof principle study 20 healthy subject 20 depressed patient . During PET scan tDCS apply vary stimulus intensity . Furthermore , subject undergo second PET scan single-blind sham stimulation order validate effect tDCS . rCMRglu quantify use voxel-wise ROI-based approach . Changes rCMRglu associate tDCS-application calculate general linear model ramp function task-specific glucose uptake , accord previous work group . Exploratory statistical test do use paired sample t-test task rest condition .</detailed_description>
