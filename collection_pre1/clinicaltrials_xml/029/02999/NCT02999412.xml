	<brief_summary>Background : Mismanaged prescribe use medication among elderly put major pressure current healthcare system . Performing medication review , structure critical examination patient 's medication , hospital stay active follow-up primary care could optimise treatment benefit minimise harm . However , lack high quality evidence inhibits widespread implementation . This manuscript describe rationale design pragmatic cluster-randomised , crossover trial fulfil need evidence . Aim : To study effect hospital-initiated comprehensive medication review , include active follow-up , elderly patient ' healthcare utilisation compare 1 ) usual care 2 ) solely hospital base review . Design : Multicentre , three-treatment , replicate , cluster-randomised , crossover trial . Setting : 8 ward multidisciplinary team within 4 hospital 3 Swedish county . Participants : Patients age 65 year old , admit one study ward . Exclusion criterion : Palliative stage ; reside hospital 's county ; medication review within last 30 day ; one-day admission . Interventions : 1 , comprehensive medication review hospital stay ; 2 , 1 addition active follow-up primary care ; 3 , usual care . Primary outcome measure : Incidence unplanned hospital visit 12-month follow-up period . Data collection analysis : Extraction collection county ' medical record system GCP compliant electronic data capture system . Intention-to-treat-analyses use log-linear Poisson generalize linear mixed model frailty model .

	<brief_title>Medication Reviews Bridging Healthcare : Cluster-randomised Crossover Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Mismanaged use multiple medication one great risk healthcare-related harm elderly put major pressure current healthcare system [ 1,2 ] . Identifying effective intervention optimise treatment benefit minimise harm international public health priority [ 3 ] . Comprehensive medication review , structure critical examination individual patient 's medication relation patient 's condition , aim accomplish goal [ 4 ] . A recently publish Cochrane meta-analysis examine whether medication review lead improvement health outcome hospitalise adult patient compare standard care [ 5 ] . Ten randomise control trial ( RCTs ) eventually use analysis . The author report find evidence medication review reduce mortality hospital admission , although evidence medication review may reduce emergency department contact find . A beneficial detrimental effect mortality hospital admission could rule estimate uncertain follow-up short . The author state strong need RCTs high quality least one year follow-up randomise cluster level minimise contamination bias [ 5 ] . In addition , cluster randomise crossover design cluster serf control would increase statistical power [ 6 ] . One include RCTs meta-analysis conduct research group Uppsala University Hospital 2005-2006 [ 7 ] . We demonstrate study patient , age 80 year old , receive comprehensive medication review include follow-up hospital discharge , perform ward base clinical pharmacist , 16 % few hospital revisits follow year . The cost hospital base care approximately €200 low per patient intervention group compare control group intervention cost include . The study conduct two internal medicine ward 400 enrol patient , 80 year old , limit generalisability result . Today , ten year previous RCT , several county Sweden employ clinical pharmacist perform medication review hospital setting . However , enough resource allocate structurally provide intervention extensive one perform previous study . There thus risk precisely part intervention contribute positive result , currently carry practice . For reason important identify activity generate great benefit patient , do perform pragmatic clinical trial , specifically design show real-world effect intervention [ 8 ] . Therefore propose pragmatic cluster-randomised , three-treatment , crossover trial study effect multidisciplinary medication review active follow-up hospital discharge elderly patient ' healthcare utilisation , compare solely hospital base review usual care . This large study generate robust result high external validity , potential show effect hard outcome healthcare utilisation . A similar study , knowledge , undertaken anywhere else world . Aim : To study effect hospital-initiated comprehensive medication review , include active follow-up , elderly patient ' healthcare utilisation compare 1 ) usual care 2 ) solely hospital base review . Primary objective : 1 . The first primary objective test hypothesis incidence unplanned hospital visit ( admission plus visit emergency department ) among elderly patient one year follow-up lower , receive comprehensive medication review active follow-up discharge , receive usual care . 2 . The second primary objective test hypothesis comprehensive medication review active follow-up discharge reduces incidence unplanned hospital visit medication review hospital stay compare usual care . Methods : This study protocol develop use applicable recommendation SPIRIT 2013 Guidance protocol clinical trial , Consort 2010 extension cluster randomise trial Consort 2010 extension randomize trial non-pharmacologic treatment [ 9-11 ] . The full study protocol attach trial registration . Setting cluster : The study conduct three county Sweden : Västmanland , Uppsala Gävleborg . Within counties four hospital take part study : Uppsala University Hospital hospital Västerås , Enköping Gävle . At hospital clinical pharmacy , include performance medication review , establish practice plan implement prior study . The intervention component study perform exist workforce two ward within hospital . The ward differ term medical specialty : geriatric , internal medicine stroke . All ward staff multidisciplinary team consist physician , nurse clinical pharmacist . The pharmacist either follow full-time one year post-graduate programme clinical pharmacy , performance medication review play central role , follow undergraduate course clinical pharmacy advance pharmacotherapy . Next , pharmacist least six month work experience perform medication review multidisciplinary team . To assess clinical skill performance relate medication review , pharmacist participate objective structured clinical examination ( OSCE ) , prior start study . All pharmacist also participate train day patient case discussion , assure common practice across study site . Other member ward team receive additional training . In total eight ward include , ward act cluster . The study carry far possible identically eight ward .</detailed_description>
