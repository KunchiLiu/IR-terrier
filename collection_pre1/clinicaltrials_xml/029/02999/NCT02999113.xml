	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND The majority error healthcare general , operate theatre particular , cause human factors1,2 . Hindering error accomplish good non-technical skill ( NTS ) , include good teamwork efficient communication within operating room ( OR ) team3,4 . NTS define 'the cognitive , social personal resource skill complement technical skill contribute safe efficient task performance ' 5 . Previously , safety study analyse measured adverse event indication patient safety4,6 . A new safety theory Erik Hollnagel , name Safety II , argue instead investigating adverse event 'measure ' safety , also investigate happens occur avoid equally important7 . This broad perspective patient safety also advocate others8-10 . In explorative , interview-based study , take Safety-II perspective examine NTS important ensure safe efficient video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery ( VATS ) lobectomy , high risk minimally invasive surgery complementary overlap scope practice surgical anaesthesia subteams . The multi-professional team identify specific important NTS serve basis share mental model ( SMMs ) regard patient , current situation resource within team . These mental model accomplish communication coordination , enable team anticipate problem stay ahead situation11 . These team perform high-risk procedure emphasize importance six identified NTS able obtain accurate SMM enable ahead view important successful safe operation . Some first look SMM requirement effective team performance Cannon-Bowers Salas 1990s12 . They define SMMs common overlap cognitive representation task requirement , procedure , role responsibility . More recent , SMMs specify share understanding task ( include equipment ) , situation resource team member . In turn , enable understand interpret situation team member know , need know doing12-14 . Moreover , others find identical similar construct SMMs , i.e . team mental models/shared situation models/team knowledge/team situation awareness , importance construct patient safety largely agree upon15-21 . SMMs sum individual mental models20,22 . They need similar , accurate share within team ; however , level information share team monitoring team result high team performance less clear17,18,23 . In recent methodology publication , different probe question use establish team member ' knowledge order measure team 's SMM situation awareness13 . The probe question related task , situation , future prediction situation include possible outcome . The teams experiment second-line emergency centre team member distinct responsibility . These team differ OR team work closely together 'physical environment ' , namely OR patient , high-risk time rather standardized task , namely operation , case elective procedure VATS lobectomy . One speculate SMMs OR team identical differ emergency centre team . So far , measurement SMMs OR team knowledge conduct simulation settings17 . To extent share mental modelling occurs within OR team clinical set know . Moreover , correlation OR team ' NTS technical skill ( TS ) previously investigate , however , still clear picture whether correlation exists4,24-26 . Additionally , study find positive correlation27-29 , whereas others find negative correlation30 . As SMMs VATS team seem enabled NTS perceive important , could hypothesise relationship SMMs TS clinical setting clearer NTS TS . Yet , unknown whether OR team ' SMMs correlate TS patient- procedure-related measure . The aim study twofold . First , explore extent SMM occur within VATS team cardiothoracic surgery setting . Second , establish whether VATS team 's SMM associate surgeon ' TS , procedural specific time , per-operative bleeding , patient characteristic ( age , gender , FEV % , comorbidity , tumour size location ) . Research question study 1 . To extent individual team member ' mental model agreement within VATS team ? 1 . Pre-operatively ? 2 . Post-operatively ? 3 . Pre- post-operative correlation ? 2 . How team 's share mental model associate 1 . The surgeon 's TS assess VATS lobectomy assessment tool ( VATSAT ) ? 2 . Procedural specific time ( see later description ) ? 3 . Amount bleed ? 4 . Patient characteristic ? METHODS Design This study case series study VATS lobectomies purposefully sample four cardiothoracic surgery centre Denmark . Data gather 60 lobectomy perform multi-professional VATS team include experienced intermediate level surgeon . Gathering data plan start December 2016 . Data sample Team member ' mental model explore two questionnaire hand team member operation ( see Appendix protocol ( Danish ) ) . The questionnaire construct use probe question Sætrevik et al. , adapt fit VATS lobectomy settings11,13,14 . Specifically , pre-operative question concern team member ' perceived technical skill , teamwork skill familiarity ; risk assessment ( 'global ' 'global view current team ' ) ; risk assessment specific task . The post-operative question concern team member ' perceived technical skill teamwork skill ; risk assessment ( 'global ' 'global view current team ' ) , leadership teamwork procedure , knowledge challenge experience procedure . Perceived technical teamwork skill , familiarity , 'global ' 'global view current team ' risk assessment rat Likert scale 1-7 , risk assessment specific possible challenging situation rat Likert scale 1-3 . The remain item either yes/no-questions open-ended question . The questionnaire hand team member individually VATS lobectomy . Endoscopic video-recordings VATS lobectomy collect thoracoscope use record device MedCapture . Using video-recordings , TS level VATS surgeon evaluate two independent raters use VATSAT assessment tool31 . The VATSAT tool evaluates eight item five point Likert scale produce pass/fail score . An observer present throughout operation collect data amount bleeding ( ml ) procedural specific time . The procedural specific time pre-specified time continuous registration time task . The pre-specified time time patient enters OR anaesthesia begin , surgeon make first incision , surgeon finish last suture , patient wake anaesthesia , patient leaf OR . The observer addition take field note qualitative analysis special focus six NTS identify previous study important safe successful VATS lobectomy . Ethics The Regional Ethics Committee Capital Region Denmark apply , letter exemption give accord Danish Law ( H-16041772 ) . The participant receive oral write information give informed consent day operation continuous option retraction consent participation . The endoscopic recording start thoracoscope inside patient . All video-recordings , physical example questionnaire master sheet store accord Danish Data Protection Law , write description final manuscript article present anonymously . Only member research team review endoscopic video-recordings . Statistical analysis Questionnaire data The preoperative questionnaire 24 item concern risk assessment team resource . The post-operative questionnaire contain 16 item . It describe risk , skill teamwork perceived team member unfolded procedure . For item , percentage answer ' I n't know ' calculate . For remain answer specific item , Cronbach 's α calculate thereby represent agreement within team . These two number ( percentage however revise number 0-1 ) multiply , thereby give number 0-1 . This do item . For questionnaire , item score add give total score , 0-24 0-16 . For pre-operative questionnaire , 24 represent total agreement within team operation , indicate complete overlap team 's SMM team resource risk assessment . For post-operative questionnaire , 16 represent total agreement within team operation , indicate complete overlap team 's view team resource , teamwork risk assessment . The post-operative questionnaire conclude open-ended question concern challenge face procedure different team member . From possible categorize answer either correct ( give score 1 ) wrong ( include ' I n't know ' ; give score 0 ) compare answer give person question . An example could scrub nurse answer surgeon challenge , surgeon answer challenge dissect lymph node , scrub nurse get score zero . In , result calculation three score SMMs regard team resource , risk assessment awareness challenge within team . Correlation calculations The item concern team member ' perceived technical skill , teamwork skill , risk assessment ( 'global ' 'global view current team ' ) collect procedure . This enable analysis well team member predict item operation compare assessment . This do calculate Pearson 's correlation coefficient r team member team . The score represent total SMM team pre- post-operatively correlate surgeon 's technical skill ( VATSAT score ) , procedural specific time , bleed patient characteristic . Pearson 's correlation coefficient r use data normally distribute Spearman 's correlation coefficient ( rho ) data non-parametrically distribute . Statistical analysis perform use IBM SPSS statistic 22 ; SPSS Inc. , Chicago , IL , USA .
