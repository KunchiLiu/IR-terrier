	<detailed_description>The treatment concept consider clinical benefit individual patient progression-free survival ( PFS ) ratio ( PFS MP-based therapy / best PFS achieve prior therapy ) &gt; 1.0 thus generate patient cohort property . Thereby , null hypothesis ( â‰¤ 40 % patient population would PFS ratio &gt; 1.0 ) evaluate patient control . For tumor type high number patient per cohort , overall response rate ( ORR ) evaluate .</detailed_description>
