	<brief_summary>The purpose trial determine efficacy immunotherapy MVX-ONCO-1 patient advanced head neck squamous cell carcinoma . MVX-ONCO-1 consist dead tumor cell patient genetically modify cell within capsule . The whole treatment take 9 week . At week 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 8 , tumor cell inject underneath skin two capsule implant week . At week 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 7 9 capsule remove . The patient followed-up 5 year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Personalized Cell-based Antitumor Immunization MVX-ONCO-1 Advanced HNSCC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients advance HNSCC platinum-based palliative chemotherapy poor prognosis , well-defined standard treatment survival 6 9 month . MVX-ONCO-1 patient specific , cell-based , active immunotherapy , patient 's immune response tumor cell stimulate and/or increase trigger immune response patient ' cancer cell . Rationale trial : 1 . HNSCC : clear medical need patient population , 2 . Relapsing HNSCC often accessible tumor tissue , 3 . HNSCC consider immunogenic tumor . This phase II study first step towards potentially innovative immunotherapy HNSCC . MVX-ONCO-1 compose : 1 . An immune-modulator ( GM-CSF : granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulate factor ) release immuno-protected , encapsulate , allogeneic , genetically modify cell line ( MVX-1 ) , 2 . Irradiated , autologous tumor cell source antigen . Each treatment consist two macrocapsules contain MVX-1 cell line implant subcutaneously lethally irradiate autologous tumor cell inject subcutaneously . Eligible patient receive treatment weekly start week 1 4 week follow two additional treatment 2 week apart ( total 6 treatment 8 week ) . Each macrocapsule remove 1 week . The patient followed-up 5 year .</detailed_description>
