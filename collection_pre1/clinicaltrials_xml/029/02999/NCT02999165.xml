	<brief_summary>The purpose study ass whether two method breathe support baby call 'Humidified High-Flow Nasal Cannula ' oxygen ( HHFNC ) 'nasal Continuous Positive Airways Pressure ' ( nCPAP ) compatible breastfeed . Many baby premature unwell birth require help breathing . This often achieve blow continuous flow air nose lung order reduce amount effort baby need inflate lung breathe . Currently centre allow baby breastfeed whilst undergo breathe support whilst centre case increase risk choke harmful event . In latter case , baby feed use nasogastric tube ( NGT ) run baby 's nostrils stomach . At centre , baby allow breastfeed whilst simultaneously either HHFNC nCPAP . This concern choke risk evidence base . This study aim conclusively prove thisfeeding protocol safe expand area research find following : - Whether breastfeed nCPAP HHFNC lead baby establish full breastfeeding sooner ( subsequently reduce length stay hospital ) - What effect breastfeed nCPAP HHFNC baby 's parent ( e.g . whether enhances bond ) - If nCPAP HHFNC different effect breastfeed As part study investigator observe stable baby nCPAP HHFNC breastfeed episode . The investigator monitor baby sign distress instability whether stable breastfeed occur . This compare episode baby feed NGT see technique well .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Breastfeeding infant receive respiratory support ( nCPAP HHFNC ) controversial topic . Expert consensus feed delayed respiratory support ( include nCPAP HHFNC ) longer need . Data animal model suggest nasal CPAP affect swallow behaviour infant animal magnitude clinical significance effect unclear even animal . Studies adult also lack show swallow impaired CPAP therapy . There research whether HHFNC similar effect population . There currently publish data safety efficacy breastfeed infant receive respiratory support via nasal CPAP HHFNC . nCPAP key intervention current care many baby prefer mode non-invasive respiratory support compare conventional mechanical ventilation show reduce incidence bronchopulmonary dysplasia . HHFNC oxygen emerge another method respiratory support . It show non-inferior nCPAP follow extubation although clear mechanic flow delivery differ nCPAP . There evidence HHFNC use associate reduction adverse effect compare nCPAP , nasal trauma . Some infant , especially infant born preterm , spend prolong period nasal CPAP HHFNC . Normal oral feeding often delayed child respiratory support need . It show premature infant show breastfeed cue early stage infant give opportunity breastfeed well establish . Recent study show early introduction oral feed preterm neonate associate adverse outcome lead early establishment full oral feed discharge home . RATIONALE FOR CURRENT STUDY There uncertainty surround safety breastfeed baby nasal nCPAP HHFNC . There great disparity clinical practice neonatal unit . At department baby respiratory support traditionally offer chance breastfeed . Local experience associate adverse event . When compare unit internationally ( part Vermont-Oxford Network neonatal unit ) unit excess complication due practice . Establishing safety breastfeed whilst receive nCPAP HHFNC provide clinician information necessary decide breastfeeding attempt infant need ongoing respiratory support . In addition study team want use opportunity establish feasibility future study . If breastfeeding nCPAP HHFNC safe study team want prepare investigation field look : - Whether infant breastfed nCPAP HHFNC show progression immature mature feed behaviour ultimately lead earlier establishment full oral feeding . - What impact breastfed nCPAP HHFNC parent baby . If breastfeeding nCPAP HHFNC help bonding would another important factor consider . - To prepare compare HHFNC nCPAP see effect breastfeed differ . If nCPAP HHFNC superior may affect clinician decision use . Clarity field enable clinician make safe decision infant receive respiratory support allow breastfeed aid delivery optimal care . STUDY OBJECTIVES The primary objective prospective observational study test hypothesis breastfeed infant undergo nCPAP HHFNC safe . The secondary objective test feasibility future study : - To investigate feasibility test hypothesis breastfeed preterm infant treat nCPAP HHFNC lead faster establishment full enteral feed could allow patient benefit earlier discharge home . This study show whether method use acceptable parent capture outcome data require . Data gather give information standard deviation outcomes enable accurate sample size calculation . - To investigate feasibility assess parental perception breastfeed baby receive respiratory support effect bonding . Questionnaire responses feedback parent review investigate feeidng issue concern . - To investigate feasibility compare nCPAP HHFNC evaluate whether different effect breastfeed infant . STUDY DESIGN Prospective , observational , single centre safety study . Recruitment occur one-year period . Parents initially approach member healthcare team . With consent contact member BIRRST team inform detail study . Written consent parent must obtain order include patient . It explain parent common practise offer infant breast fed still respiratory support unit . No change make management baby enrol study . Babies observe feed episode time feed , whether baby feed breastfeed NGT detail relate feed administer decision make nursing team look baby ( conjunction baby 's parent ) . The study team influence say decision observe standard practice unit . 50 infant recruit , 25 infant treat nCPAP 25 infant treat HHFNC breast feeding attempt make . Each child estimate 4 6 observation . There crossover respiratory support modality . Infants without respiratory support longer eligible include study . 130 paired observation breastfeed NGT feed nCPAP treatment make . In addition 130 paired observation breastfeed NGT feed baby HHFNC make . Each infant serve control feed episode pair breastfeed NGT feed observe within 12 hour period . This minimise variation cause change infant ' condition . It unlikely infant able obtain sufficient volume milk learn breastfeed breastfeed attempt baby offer top-up via NGT ensure receive require feed volume . Once baby enrol study feed episode regularly observe ( feasible respect staff availability parental presence ) . If baby unwell observe documented . Prior observation baby 's stability precede hour evaluate recorded . During feed episode infant directly observe 30 minute period either receive breast feed subsequent NGT top solely NGT feed . Subsequently baby 's stability follow hour retrospectively assess . All infant receive continuous nCPAP HHFNC throughout . During feed episode heart rate oxygen saturation continuously monitor use pulse oximetry . Apnoea monitor use assess episode apnoea . Axillary temperature assess begin end feeding episode . The oxygen requirement measure CPAP/HHFNC machine . The stability neonate feed episode compare stability precede hour review document incidence desaturations , bradycardias apnoeas neonate 's temperature observation chart . Quality breastfeed assess use videos breastfeeding episode . These video review trained assessor ( Speech Language Therapists interest lactation Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust ) use PIBBS tool ass quality feed . They look feed behaviour assess maturity feeding . Serial feed episode compare ass whether progression immature mature feed baby breastfeed opportunity CPAP HHFNC . This data use ass whether future study area explore feeding behaviour progress would beneficial . It also record correct gestational age/actual age baby establish oral feeding ; feed discharge ( breast bottle ) milk discharge home . This data allow planning future study assess whether early attempt breastfeed whilst receive CPAP HHFNC help establishment full breastfeeding . The parental perception feed respiratory support assess use parental questionnaire . This use visual analogue scale ass whether parent feel breastfeed respiratory support beneficial infant overall care impact feed opportunity bond baby . This data use assess feasibility study area establish parental tolerance breastfeed baby receive respiratory support develop questionnaire effectively explore parental experience . The data collect nCPAP HHFNC separately use establish sample size required future study compare two modality see significant difference two ( term safety , efficacy parental tolerance ) . STATISTICS AND DATA ANALYSIS Analysis pilot study data suggest desaturation common adverse event associate feed nCPAP HHFNC treatment . The sample size calculate show significant difference base result pilot data . 128 feed episode require get 80 % power 5 % significance level find difference mean duration desaturation episodes 1.25 minute , base standard deviation change outcome 5 ( take pilot data ) . This felt clinically significant increase desaturation episodes 30 minute period . The feed episode may come around 25 baby . As baby act control ( breastfeed episode pair episode NGT feeding occur within 24 hour ) sample size dependent number feed episode observe , number baby . Analysis : pair t-test mean duration desaturation . McNemar 's test compare paired proportion group . Data appropriate documentation store 5 year completion study , include follow-up period .</detailed_description>
