	<brief_title>Validation Radio-induced Damage Biomarkers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The nuclear radiologic risk monitor major preoccupation society . During accident , primordial define biologic dosimetry . The dose distribution knowledge crucial medical care . Indeed , Total Body Irradiation ( TBI ) Partial Body Irradiation ( PBI ) clinical outcome . A Total Body Irradiation induce acute radiation syndrome Medullary Aplasia . A quick diagnostic would allow optimization medical care . Nowadays , analyse chromosome two centromere current norm estimate radiation dose , technique time consuming , adapt emergency situation , large population . The new genetic technique could permit quick radiation dosimetry diagnosis . The research early exposition bio-markers seem major interest . These bio-markers would allow rapidly define radiation perceive exposed subject , apparition symptom , way , conduct therapeutic strategy adapt patient . In purpose , present study need blood urine sample patient totally partially exposed radiation , accord usual medical care .</detailed_description>

OR For group B : Patient one ( ) pelvis metastasis require radiation therapy without concomitant chemotherapy , accord follow protocol : 4 Gray per day 5 day . More 70 year old , Subject present abnormal blood count ( grade 3 ) , Person control chronic illness , Subject present abnormal hepatic assessment ( grade 3 ) , Subject already receive ionizing treatment , Subject reach HIV , hepatitis C progressive infectious disease , Pregnant woman nurse mother , Person protection justice unable give consent .</criteria>
