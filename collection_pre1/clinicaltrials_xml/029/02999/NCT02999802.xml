	<detailed_description>Anabolic resistance nutrition reduce ability skeletal muscle increase protein synthesis response feeding . It major contributor muscle atrophy age , inactivity , burn , trauma , cancer cachexia . The effect anabolic resistance health physical function important . For example , loss muscle mass strength age ( sarcopenia ) increase risk fall , physical dependency morbidity old adult . A major determinant muscle size muscle protein content , control fine balance protein synthesis breakdown . Recently , investigator find amino acid exercise independently increase muscle protein synthesis overall anabolism activate mammalian/mechanistic target rapamycin complex 1 ( mTORC1 ) signal pathway human . Aging inactivity reduce anabolic effect , underlie mechanism anabolic resistance know . The purpose application well understand anabolic resistance develop skeletal muscle . The long-term goal identify specific molecular target development evidence-based clinical intervention counteract anabolic resistance muscle waste clinical population . Here , investigator focus one potential mechanism underlie anabolic resistance amino acid : activation mTORC1 human muscle cell . The central hypothesis physical activity restore mTORC1 signal primary contributor anabolic resistance human skeletal muscle . Investigators test hypothesis healthy subject follow specific aim : Determine effect increase habitual physical activity anabolic resistance . Investigators study human subject utilize stable isotope model measure amino acid kinetics muscle protein metabolism combination molecular analysis muscle determine regulatory role amino acid , physical inactivity , amino acid transporter functional activity mTORC1 . The propose approach innovative represent new substantial departure status quo investigator examine underlie mechanism anabolic resistance nutrition use novel methodological approach . The propose research significant lead development evidence-based intervention treat sarcopenia muscle wasting .</detailed_description>
