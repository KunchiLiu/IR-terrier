	<brief_summary>This research study explore chemotherapy combination immunotherapy ( therapy use body 's immune system control cancer ) possible treatment hormone receptor positive breast cancer . The intervention involve study : - Pembrolizumab ( MK-3475 ; Keytruda™ ) - Nab-Paclitaxel ( Abraxane</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Of Changes In PD-L1 Expression During Preoperative Treatment With Nab-Paclitaxel And Pembrolizumab In Hormone Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study Pilot Study , first time investigator examine study intervention . In research study , investigator look participant body tumor respond combination Nab-paclitaxel Pembrolizumab . Also , investigator examine participant tumor tissue learn disease . The FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve Pembrolizumab specific disease ; approve United States treatment disease . The FDA approve Nab-paclitaxel treatment option type breast cancer ; approve United States treatment metastatic breast cancer ( breast cancer spread part body ) . Pembrolizumab medicine may treat cancer work participant 's immune system . The immune system body 's natural defense disease . The immune system send type cell call `` T cell '' throughout body detect fight infection disease , include cancer . For type cancer , T cell work prevent attacking tumor . Pembrolizumab think work block protein T cell call PD-1 ( `` program death 1 '' ) , allow cell part immune system attack tumor . Nab-paclitaxel ( Abraxane ) part class medication call antimicrotubule agent . It work stop growth spread cancer cell block action protein call microtubule . The combination Pembrolizumab Nab-paclitaxel investigational . `` Investigational '' mean combination study drug study . The study drug , give separately , work different way stop cancer cell grow spread . However , know give two study drug time well anti-cancer effect give treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must histologically cytologically confirm invasive breast cancer . Participants must operable breast cancer , tumor great equal 2 cm size ; Participants must evidence metastatic disease . Invasive disease must test ER , PR , HER2 participant must hormone receptorpositive , HER2negative breast cancer ( ER &gt; 1 % PR &gt; 1 % , AND HER2negative per ASCO CAP guideline , 2013 ) . Prior systemic therapy : No prior chemotherapy , biologic therapy , hormonal therapy investigational therapy operable breast cancer . Prior radiation therapy : No prior radiation ipsilateral breast . The participant ≥18 year old The participant Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ≤1 ( see Appendix A ) Participants must normal organ marrow function define : Absolute neutrophil count ≥1500/mm3 Platelets ≥100,000/mm3 Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL Total Bilirubin ≤1.5 mg/dL ( &lt; 2.0 participant know Gilbert 's syndrome ) Serum creatinine ≤1.5 mg/dL OR calculate GFR ≥60mL/min Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ≤ 2.5 time upper limit normal . International normalized ratio ( INR ) Prothrombin Time ( PT ) &lt; 1.5 time upper limit normal unless subject receive anticoagulant therapy , long PT PTT within therapeutic range intend use anticoagulant . Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time ( aPTT ) &lt; 1.5 time upper limit normal unless subject receive anticoagulant therapy , long PT PTT within therapeutic range intend use anticoagulant . The participant capable understand comply protocol sign informed consent document . The participant must willing undergo three require research biopsy course protocol therapy . Participants undergo attempt research biopsy procedure purpose protocol , inadequate tissue obtain , require undergo repeat biopsy order continue protocol . The effect pembrolizumab develop human fetus unknown . For reason , woman men childbearing potential must agree use adequate contraception ( Section 5.5.2 ) start first dose study therapy duration study participation , 120 day last dose study medication . Note : Abstinence acceptable usual lifestyle prefer contraception subject . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . While study , woman may breastfeed . Women childbearing potential define surgically sterilize free menses &gt; 1 year . Female subject childbearing potential negative urine serum pregnancy test within 72 hour prior receive first dose study medication . If urine test positive confirm negative , serum pregnancy test require . Participants bisphosphonates may continue receive bisphosphonate therapy study treatment . The participant receive prior pembrolizumab antiPD1 , antiPDL1 , antiPDL2 therapy , participate prior study involve pembrolizumab Hypersensitivity pembrolizumab excipients . The participant history evidence active , noninfectious pneumonitis interstitial lung disease . The participant uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , uncontrolled hypertension , unstable angina pectoris , uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia , congestive heart failure ( New York Heart Association Class III IV ; see Appendix B ) , active ischemic heart disease , myocardial infarction within previous six month , uncontrolled diabetes mellitus , chronic liver renal disease , severe malnutrition . Concurrent use potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ( see Appendix C ) , ketoconazole erythromycin , avoid study treatment nabpaclitaxel . Pregnant woman exclude study pembrolizumab potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother pembrolizumab , breastfeed discontinue mother treated pembrolizumab . Active infection require intravenous antibiotic week 1 day 1 . Individuals history second malignancy ineligible except follow circumstance . Individuals history malignancy eligible diseasefree least 5 year deem investigator low risk recurrence malignancy . Individuals follow cancer eligible diagnose treat within past 5 year : cervical cancer situ , nonmelanoma cancer skin . Participants cancer diagnose within past 5 year felt low risk recurrence discuss study sponsor determine eligibility . The participant medical condition require chronic systemic steroid therapy form immunosuppressive medication include disease modifying agent , require therapy last 2 year . Replacement therapy ( eg. , thyroxine , insulin , physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy adrenal pituitary insufficiency , etc . ) consider form systemic treatment . The participant active autoimmune disease document history autoimmune disease syndrome require systemic steroid immunosuppressive agent . The participant positive Hepatitis B surface antigen , Hepatitis C RNA . Known HIVpositive participant . HIVpositive patient combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction pembrolizumab . In addition , participant increase risk lethal infection bone marrow suppressive therapy , i.e . nabpaclitaxel . Appropriate study undertake participant receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate . The participant receive live vaccine within 28 day plan start study therapy . Seasonal influenza vaccine infection generally inactivate flu vaccine allow ; however intranasal influenza vaccine ( i.e . FluMist ® ) live attenuate vaccine , allow .</criteria>
