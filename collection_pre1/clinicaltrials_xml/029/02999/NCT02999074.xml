	<brief_summary>The BENEFIT-Study randomize control 3-arm intervention trial investigate currently discuss hypothesis exercise concomitant chemotherapy ( CTx ) may beneficial effect cancer prognosis boost anti-tumoral effect cytostatics enhance therapy compliance . This hypothesis base pre-clinical exploratory clinical trial . Breast cancer patient schedule neoadjuvant CTx randomize either resistance training aerobic training concomitant neoadjuvant CTx , wait list control group get exercise intervention neoadjuvant CTx ( i.e . usual care ) exercise breast surgery . The primary study endpoint clinical-pathologic stage ( CPS-EG ) score , show valid prognostic factor respect survival neoadjuvant CTx routinely assess breast surgery . Further , effect resistance aerobic exercise pathological complete response ( pCR ) , tolerability compliance CTx , physical fitness , patient report outcome fatigue , sleep problem , quality life , depressive symptom , anxiety pain , select biomarkers investigate . First internal pilot phase n=33 patient conduct . Upon recruitment rate , overall feasibility funding , plan study thereafter directly continue phase III trial ( anticipated sample size n=342 ) , possibly adaption base experience gain pilot phase . No interim analysis unblinding pilot data plan , pilot data integrate phase III study . A confirmation study hypothesis would strong argument patient engage exercise early neoadjuvant CTx . The trial also provide evidence-based guidance patient regard type timing training .</brief_summary>
