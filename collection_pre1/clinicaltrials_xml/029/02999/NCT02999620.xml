	<detailed_description>This clinical investigation determine fat loss stool associate alpha-CD use compare placebo ingest standardized liquid breakfast ( 100 microCi [ 3H ] triolein ) 20 microCi [ 14C ] tripalmitin ) . The ingested dose 2 g α-CD three meal per day 2 day . Eight subject recruit two-way crossover design consist two treatment period . Treatment 1 require subject receive α-CD meal contain fatty acid radiotracers Treatment 2 require subject receive placebo meal contain fatty acid radiotracers All subject observe 48 hour in-patient , 24 hour out-patient follow meal contain radiotracer undergo least ≥ 14 day washout period cross alternate treatment . All subject randomize α-CD treatment arm receive 2 g α-CD ( 2 x 1 g tablet ) , three meal per day 2 day . During placebo phase , subject receive two identical-looking placebo tablet .</detailed_description>
