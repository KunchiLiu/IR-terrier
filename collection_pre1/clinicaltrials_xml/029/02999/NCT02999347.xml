	<brief_title>Pregnancy After Tension-free Vaginal Tape Other Mid-urethral Sling Procedures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stress urinary incontinence ( SUI ) define involuntary leakage urine effort , exertion , sneeze cough laugh . This common form incontinence woman affect one three age 18 year significant impact quality life . The Tension-free vaginal tape ( TVT ) introduce 1996 become one widely use incontinence operation worldwide . In 2001 , Delorme describe new mid-urethral sling use outside-in transobturator approach , tape insert skin obturator foramen vagina ( TOT ) . DeLeval develop similar approach 2003 , tape insert inside-out vagina obturator foramen skin ( TVT-O ) . TVT , TOT TVT-O collectively know mid-urethral sling ( MUS ) operation . Mid-urethral sling ( MUS ) operation perform minimal invasive surgery local anesthesia short operative time minimal surgical dissection . This type surgery consider standard surgical management SUI mix urinary incontinence ( MUI ) predominant stress component . The short- long term result comparable Burch colposuspension well document . Surgical treatment SUI MUI generally recommend completion childbearing several reason , one reason numerous study demonstrate pregnancy delivery risk factor SUI . Furthermore , woman treat MUS , new pregnancy delivery might , theory , change position tape lead recurrence incontinence symptom . Women treat MUS , recurrence SUI MUI , also poorer outcome give second procedure ( either MUS bulking agent ) . There limited knowledge consequence pregnancy woman undergone mid-urethral sling operation , case report exist literature . There currently consensus either management subsequent pregnancy mode delivery MUS surgery . Some clinical expert claim vaginal delivery , baby 's head exert pressure anterior vaginal wall , may cause tape dislocate potential injury bladder urethra15 . During last decade , mark increase number mid-urethral sling operation . This increase probably due excellent short long-term result , less morbidity short hospital stay compare colposuspension ( previous `` gold standard '' SUI ) . It may therefore expect future woman fertile age request surgical treatment SUI completion childbearing . Several observational study show SUI prevalent patient deliver least one child . Obstetrical factor vaginal birth vs. elective cesarean section , parity , age first pregnancy/birth operative vaginal delivery associate increase risk develop SUI . In addition , anal incontinence fertile woman associate SUI , probably due risk pudendal nerve damage obstetrical anal sphincter injury subsequent anal incontinence . Although obstetric factor associate development SUI , study whether factor may negatively impact outcome SUI surgery . The Norwegian Female Incontinence Registry ( NFIR ) establish 1998 . The purpose registry ensure quality incontinence surgery Norway department able keep track result use information improve quality surgery . The majority gynecological department Norway perform incontinence surgery report preoperative subjective objective data , type incontinence procedure complication , well 6-12 month ' subjective objective follow-up data registry . There currently 20 000 patient record registry , deidentified form , mean Department perform operation access patient identity cod patient ID number ( NFIR-number ) . Approximately 5 000 woman register childbearing age ( &lt; 45 year old ) time operation . In 2013 NFIR obtain status National Quality Registry .</detailed_description>
