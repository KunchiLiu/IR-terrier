During typical four-week ECT series , depressive episode respond treatment people improve level functioning ( return work family ) . Independent antidepressant effect ECT , many patient experience transient memory impairment .

	<detailed_description>Electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) remain gold-standard treatment patient depressive episode . During typical four-week ECT series , depressive episode remit , formerly suicidal psychotically depressed patient resume premorbid level function . Independent antidepressant effect ECT , many patient experience debilitate transient cognitive effect attention memory deficit . These unwanted side effect particularly trouble old patient likely exist cognitive deficit . Both stimulus delivery ( electrode placement , pulse amplitude , pulse width ) seizure induction appear work synergy , underlie mechanism action successful response yet fully elucidate . Moreover , work need understand relationship clinical improvement cognitive impairment . This investigation examine clinical neurocognitive impact target medial temporal lobe engagement function pulse amplitude , one several variable factor influence ECT charge . The ECT charge measure millicoulombs ( mC ) derive multiply pulse train duration , pulse-pair frequency , pulse width , pulse amplitude . Pulse amplitude determines induce electric field strength brain presently fix 900 milliampere ( mA ) clinical scientific justification . The central hypothesis investigation optimal pulse amplitude individual patient enhance neuroplasticity ( clinical response ) minimize disruption dominant hemisphere hippocampal cognitive circuitry ( result cognitive stability ) . The preliminary data informs dosage range 600 800 mA . Pulse amplitude outside range compromise efficacy ( 500 mA ) may increase risk cognitive impairment ( 900 mA ) . The first aim investigation identify electric field strength neuroplasticity associate clinical response . Critically , aim establish neuroplasticity threshold , define electric field strength necessary induce neuroplasticity . The second aim detect neural correlate ECT-mediated cognitive change , may relate disrupted dominant hemisphere long-term potentiation . The third aim use data-driven dual regression predict optimal pulse amplitude individual patient . This contribution significant electric field , manipulate pulse amplitude , subsequently maximize hippocampal neuroplasticity ( efficacy ) minimize disrupt connectivity ( cognitive stability ) thus improve clinical outcome .</detailed_description>
