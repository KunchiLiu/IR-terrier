	<detailed_description>The HIV epidemic China concentrate among men sex men ( MSM ) , account third new HIV infection . Despite strengthened prevention effort increase availability HIV test country , test rate low condomless sex common among Chinese MSM . Globally , condomless sex among MSM , particularly primary partner , also ubiquitous . To reduce HIV transmission risk context condomless sex , MSM community adopt range sexual harm reduction strategy ( i.e. , seroadaptive behavior ) . Essential effectiveness strategy accurate knowledge HIV status within partnership . This necessitate frequent HIV test mutual HIV status disclosure . However , significant proportion MSM never test recently test unaware partner 's HIV status , especially setting sexual minority stigmatize . Among Chinese MSM , ability successfully use harm reduction strategy severely limit low level HIV test disclosure efficacy . As result , many Chinese MSM make unreliable assumption partner ' serostatus ( i.e. , seroguessing ) , result risky condomless sex . As many men access facility-based testing , new emerge HIV test option must expand help men make inform decision sexual risk harm reduction . HIV self-testing ( HIVST ) offer promising prevention strategy reach untested Chinese MSM , increase testing frequency , serve valuable prevention tool assist harm reduction . The investigator propose determine feasibility preliminary efficacy HIVST intervention facilitate sexual harm reduction reduce HIV transmission among MSM Nanjing , China . The investigator : 1 ) conduct participant observation ( N = 20 ) cognitive interview ( N=10 ) determine information support need MSM use HIVST safely practice sexual harm reduction responsibly ; 2 ) recruit enroll 300 high-risk HIV-negative MSM RCT intervention group offer HIVST kit plus harm reduction education follow 9-month period determine whether intervention increase uptake frequency test partnership , improve disclosure awareness partner ' HIV status , therefore facilitate sexual harm reduction reduces HIV transmission . Expanding HIV test among key population priority HIV prevention worldwide . Innovative strategy need encourage MSM seek HIV test take consideration exist paradigms community-originated driven harm reduction strategy . As HIVST introduce different setting become accessible , finding propose study provide vital information current pattern seroadaptation HIVST use ; identify needed promote HIVST 's proper use harm reduction linkage HIV/STI care , whether HIVST improve accuracy harm reduction strategy .</detailed_description>
