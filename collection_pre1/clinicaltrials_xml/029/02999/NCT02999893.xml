	<brief_title>A Study APR-246 Oesophageal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cancer oesophagus ( OC ) distinguish poor outcome patient incidence rise faster solid cancer . It already eighth common cancer , sixth common cause death cancer , worldwide . The majority patient diagnose late stage disease , incurable current standard multimodality therapy . Thus , critical need develop new treatment disease . Surprisingly , despite high prevalence develop country , increase incidence Western population , metastatic OC remain 'orphan disease ' good quality randomise trial available guide practice . As result , treatment OC change little past decade , consequence modest improvement overall survival patient disease . TP53 , key tumour suppressor gene , mutate 70-80 % OC ( adenocarcinoma squamous cell carcinoma ) provide attractive potential target OC therapy . Although paired tissue study primary metastatic OC lacking , p53 mutation occur early oesophageal carcinogenesis unlikely lose advanced disease . OC mutant ( mut ) -p53 resistant conventional chemotherapy mut-p53 associate poor patient prognosis . Over last decade , several novel drug develop target mut-p53 restore wild-type ( wt ) -p53 function cancer cell . Of , APR-246 ( also know PRIMA-1MET ) , first-in-class agent target mutant p53 result re-expression wild-type p53 activity , proven effective wide range mutant . APR-246 pro-drug give rise active compound methylene quinuclidinone ( MQ ) , covalently bind thiol group cysteine residue p53 core domain result refolding mut-p53 protein restoration tumour suppressor activity . While reactivation mut-p53 think primary mode action APR-246 , preclinical study suggest potential alternative mechanism ( e.g . depletion cellular glutathione level ) may also contribute efficacy APR-246 , especially use combination cisplatin/5-FU chemotherapy . Thus , anti-tumour activity APR-246 may limit mut-p53 bearing tumour . Mutation p53 common genetic aberration oesophageal cancer detect 80 % oesophageal squamous cell cancer adenocarcinomas . APR-246 first-in-class agent target mutant p53 . In vitro vivo preclinical model demonstrate APR-246 excellent efficacy OC ( adenocarcinoma squamous cell carcinoma ) potently synergises chemotherapy use treatment OC , restore sensitivity chemotherapy-resistant tumour . An initial phase I clinical trial show APR-246 safe human early result currently run phase Ib/II trial APR-246 carboplatin liposomal doxorubicin ovarian cancer promising . Together , data provide strong rationale investigate efficacy APR-246 OC .</detailed_description>
