	<detailed_description>Intensive glucose control vital prognosis preservation normal physiologic status trauma patient . The acute effect severe trauma , infection , surgery result remarkable metabolic stress human body . Hyperglycemia normal metabolic response stress injury [ 1 ] . Irrespective involved injury mechanism , post-traumatic metabolic change occur due stress term increase glucose production , decreased insulin production , insulin resistance peripheral tissue eventually lead state hyperglycemia . Traumatic injury also induce change endogenous hormone production enhance utilization metabolite usually lead stress relate hyperglycemia . Measurement HbA1c level use screen tool discriminate unknown diabetes mellitus stress-induced hyperglycemia ( SIH ) . Published study evaluate association present hyperglycemia bad outcome trauma patient consistently show high mortality infection rate patient present elevated serum glucose level 200 mg/dL [ 2-5 ] . A recent study evaluate differential effect SIH comparison diabetic hyperglycemia ( DH ) outcomes trauma victim . The author observe opposed DH , SIH associate high mortality rate injury [ 4 ] . A prospective study patient severe traumatic brain injury demonstrate admission glucose level &gt; 11.1 mmol/L associate increased mortality poor neurologic outcome [ 6 ] . Stress associate critical illness characterize activation inflammatory cellular mediator [ 7 ] . During acute illness increase systemic inflammatory response characterize increased production pro-inflammatory cytokine . Importantly , relationship abnormal cytokine production hyperglycemia severe sepsis patient aggravate immune response lead poor clinical outcome . Recent study suggest interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) involve glucose metabolism insulin action . The proinflammatory IL-6 normally release upon infection ; however , induces insulin resistance condition hyperglycemia [ 8 ] . Moreover , IL-18 level significantly elevate diabetic patient microalbuminuria compare patient normoalbuminuria [ 9 ] . This might indicate certain interleukin ( IL ) involve pathogenesis SIH . Though , clinical relevance observe SIH trauma patient remain unclear . The early study suggest implication cytokine SIH outcomes trauma . To date , little information regard effect diabetic hyperglycemia ( occult know ) clinical outcome trauma whether patient represent distinct group differential outcome compare SIH . The purpose study identify incidence SIH well diabetic hyperglycemia trauma patient investigate association proinflammatory cytokine level hyperglycemia trauma population . Primary objective : - To evaluate outcome stress induce hyperglycemia patient present traumatic injury . Secondary objective : - To investigate association pro-inflammatory cytokine level SIH trauma patient . - To identify incidence SIH occult diabetes mellitus trauma population . It prospective study include adult trauma patient require hospital admission investigate random plasma glucose level HbA1C measure within 5 hour admission . All trauma patient undergo thorough clinical assessment resuscitation accord Advanced Trauma Life Support ( ATLS ) guideline . The present study screen traumatic injury patient present trauma room willing participate provide write informed consent consent relative use emergency consent ( Exception Informed Consent Requirements Emergency Research '' Policy # 11026 ) draw blood investigation include study . All study subject manage accord standard care hospital . The investigator directly access adult traumatic injury patient present trauma room review medical file and/or electronic medical record ( EMR ) confirm eligibility . Usually trauma patient unconscious , shock physically mentally unfit communicate sign consent . The trauma surgeon explain consent form legal representative subject separate chamber ICU private room clinic . Consent recruitment procedure do way disclose patient trauma room ward . The information regard patient 's enrollment keep confidential study related interaction subject/patient 's legal representative do isolated room ward clinic maintain complete privacy . To safeguard severe trauma patient , inform consent take participate research legally authorize representative behalf cognitively impaired subject . In absence legally authorize representative , investigator use emergency consent ( Exception Informed Consent Requirements Emergency Research '' Policy # 11026 ) . Patients partially recover cognition ask provide Assent fully recover cognition understand study ask informed consent continue participation . For trauma patient unconscious , severe shock physically mentally unfit communicate , legally authorize representative identify help patient 's attendant . Explaining consent take around half hour , legal representative consent allow subject participation within 5 hour admission , he/she enrol . Since research investigation need do early hour admission wait time could maximum 2-3 hour post admission . This study include specific procedure could provide distress participant . And subject 's privacy specifically take care . Sample size estimation : There lack information incidence stress-induced hyperglycemia among trauma patient Qatar . However , current literature report incidence stress-induced hyperglycemia ( ≥200 mg/dl ) trauma patient range 10 % -17 % trauma admission [ 3,4 ] . Therefore , take frequency hyperglycemia 15 % 5 % confidence limit 97 % confidence level , total 250 consecutive trauma patient need included study . The investigator aim complete target subject recruitment within 12 month research may take 18 month complete . Bio-specimens : The blood specimen research ( 10 ml initially recruitment 5 ml 24 48 hour admission ) drawn together routine blood investigation . For study participant , blood drawn admission investigate Hemoglobin , HbA1C , blood glucose level , Lactate , Base Deficit , High sensitive troponin T ( HsTnT ) , Interleukin-6 , Interleukin-18 high sensitive C-reactive protein . Moreover , 24 48 hour admission , fast blood glucose level , hemoglobin , Lactate , Base Deficit , Interleukin-6 , Interleukin-18 high sensitive C-reactive protein repeat patient . The main exposure hyperglycemia , define serum glucose 200 mg/dL . This level glucose previously use several trauma study , commonly utilized cutoff define hyperglycemia . Diabetes mellitus determine patient history and/or admission HbA1c ≥ 6.5 % . This level HbA1c base current recommendation diagnosis diabetes mellitus American Diabetes Association [ 10 ] . All study participant manage accord standard care hospital . The investigator expect enroll 250 consecutive trauma patient include study Hamad General Hospital , Doha , Qatar ( number participant per center case become multicenter study reach 750-1000 total ) . The subject research discharge hospital die hospital follow-up visit research . Data collection &amp; integrity : For study participant , information collect regard demographic ( e.g. , age , sex , nationality ) , injury ( i.e. , injury mechanism , ISS ) , clinical characteristic ( i.e. , hospital stay , ICU day , day ventilator support ) . Information collect regard outcome , include mortality in-hospital complication ( i.e. , pneumonia , renal failure , sepsis , Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome multiorgan failure ) . The principal investigator ( PI ) provide specific pre-assigned number sample collect PI know subject identifier others work number . However , process receive storage sample , one appoint technical staff laboratory service access blood specimen . The investigator track specimens receive allot unique subject identifier blood specimen track sample transportation , processing , consumption . Each sample label properly color-coded cryo box -80°C discard immediately test . Only PI access data cod subject identifier . The de-identified data individual data collection sheet enter research coordinator password protect Excel file . Participation study voluntary participant discontinue time , he/she willing withdraw . If participant interested withdraw study , he/she need contact lead principle investigator study decision affect medical care . In case subject recruit emergency consent , patient recovery he/she right withdraw study time voluntarily . If patient chooses withdraw study , ask permission use data time withdrawal . Data collect time withdrawal . Data collect time withdrawal . The exist data remove research use intention-to-treat analysis . However , specimen discard data generate . Data management : Data collection sheet use record relevant information individual subject . The de-identified data individual data collection sheet enter research coordinator password protect Excel file . Only PI access data cod subject identifier . The PI designate research team member access de-identified data . Data store secure logbook/secured computer PI . Hard copy also store closed envelope lock cabinet PI 's office .
