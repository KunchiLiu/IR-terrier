	<brief_title>Pulse Oxygen Saturation ( SpO2 ) Directed Oxygen Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In fear harmful effect hypoxia , oxygen therapy commonly use , especially critically ill patient intensive care unit ( ICUs ) . However , hyperoxia harmful . Examples myocardial infarction ( MI ) patient patient resuscitate return spontaneous circulation cardiac arrest . In Air Versus Oxygen Myocardial Infarction ( AVOID ) trial , Meyhoff colleague prove hyperoxia cause cardiac injury patient ST-elevation MI without hypoxia . Kilgannon colleague find arterial hyperoxia follow resuscitation cardiac arrest associate increase in-hospital mortality , pulse oxygen saturation ( SpO2 ) 94-98 % recommend . Recently , Panwar colleague find compare liberal oxygen strategy ( SpO2 ≥96 % ) , conservative oxygen strategy ( SpO2 88 % -92 % ) feasible patient receive invasive mechanical ventilation . Girardis colleague find control oxygen therapy ( target SpO2 94 % -98 % PaO2 70-100mmHg ) result low ICU mortality conventional oxygen therapy ( SpO2 ≥97 % ) randomize clinical trial call Oxygen-ICU . However , Oxygen-ICU trial single-centered , early-terminated 480 patient include lead unplanned interim analysis . In large multicenter trial , investigator hypothesize relative low SpO2 direct oxygen therapy safe would reduce 28-day mortality patient stay longer 72 hour ICUs .</detailed_description>
