	<brief_summary>The aim current study investigate efficacy safety nintedanib 52 week patient Progressive Fibrosing Interstitial Lung Disease ( PF-ILD ) define patient present feature diffuse fibrosing lung disease &gt; 10 % extent high-resolution compute tomography ( HRCT ) whose lung function respiratory symptom chest image worsen despite treatment unapproved medication use clinical practice treat ILD . There currently efficacious treatment available PF-ILD . Based efficacy safety Idiopatic Pulmonary Fibrosis ( IPF ) , anticipate Nintedanib new treatment option patient PF-ILD .</brief_summary>
