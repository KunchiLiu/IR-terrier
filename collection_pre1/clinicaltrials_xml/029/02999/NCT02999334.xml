	<brief_title>HIV With Innovative Group Antenatal Care Two African Countries</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>More 90 % woman sub-Saharan Africa use antenatal care ( ANC ) least pregnancy . To leverage high attendance rate , facility bundle HIV prevention prevention maternal-to-child transmission ( PMTCT ) ANC . Unfortunately , quality ANC sub-Saharan Africa sharply constrain severe resource staffing shortage , reflect numerous `` missed opportunity '' PMTCT , clinical service delivery , health education . Moreover , job satisfaction among overburdened provider low . To improve ANC quality , investigator adapt pilot innovative , evidence-based model group ANC , approach restructures provider time , allow health facility offer respectful , woman-centered high quality ANC give limitation . In CenteringPregnancy ( CP ) , evidence-based model group ANC , 12 woman meet jointly two hour antenatal visit , assess weight blood pressure , meet briefly provider individual consultation , engage facilitate health discussion . Randomized control trial ( RCT ) data ethnically socioeconomically diverse population US demonstrate CP highly effective improve ANC adherence , provider client satisfaction , maternal child outcome . In US , successful integration HIV prevention CP model reduce sexually transmitted infection increase condom use . CP implement fidelity test efficacy low-resource country . With funding Chicago Developmental Center AIDS Research , investigator conduct preliminary work Malawi Tanzania suggest CP-based model group ANC feasible acceptable ; woman provider excite energized model . The purpose study build work : 1 ) conduct developmental work collaboratively adapt CP material use country ( session , train guide , implementation evaluation strategy ) ; 2 ) train provider pretest activity ; 3 ) conduct full-scale randomized pilot . Investigators work directly Centering Healthcare Institute implement CP-based model group ANC fidelity . This study result feasible , acceptable , sustainable CP-based model group ANC adapt constraint pose poorly resourced health system client serve . These pilot data use generate retention rate effect size RCT test efficacy CP-based group ANC model . Group antenatal care innovative paradigm shift ANC , rigorous evaluation impact expand limit scientific assessment reconfigured ANC model mother infant health outcome low-resource country sub-Saharan Africa . Because model develop test target country high HIV prevalence poor maternal neonatal outcome , potential broad impact maternal child health , include PMTCT , low resource setting .</detailed_description>
