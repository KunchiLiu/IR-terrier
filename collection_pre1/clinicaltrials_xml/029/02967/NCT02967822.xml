	<brief_summary>In order understand molecular mechanism lead Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome ( MRKH ) , research team identify molecular base anomaly . Toward goal , research team would like include study patient MRKH syndrome , well healthy relative , order perform genetic analysis , especially whole exome sequencing . This study set order collect biological sample patient MRKH relative .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Molecular Genetic Study Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The MRKH congenital rare malformation characterise absence uterus 2/3 vagina . The incidence 1 4500 female child ( 46 , XX ) genetic component identify . In order understand molecular mechanism lead disease , research team identify genetic abnormality . This study lead research team Imagine Institute clinical team associate Reference Center Rare Diseases PGR ( Rare Gynecologic Diseases ) . Both group base Necker Hospital campus , already closely collaborate research MRKH syndrome . This collaboration allow : ) collect biological sample propositus relative , ii ) medical expertise . The clinician involve study recruit patient , whose participation involve provide biological sample , ie , blood sample and/or uterine tissue collect surgical ablation , event surgery perform clinical follow-up patient . No specific intervention plan purpose study . In order perform genetic analysis trio , healthy relative patient ( parent , brother , sister ) also include . Blood sample take healthy relative . Genetic analysis , especially whole exome sequencing , perform blood sample research team Imagine Institute .</detailed_description>
