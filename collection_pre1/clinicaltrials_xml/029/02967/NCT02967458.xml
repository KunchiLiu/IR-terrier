	<brief_summary>This phase II single center study use contrast-enhanced ultrasound identify aggressive form prostate cancer subharmonic imaging . The follow study objective : 1 . To implement subharmonic image technology transrectal probe suitable prostate image biopsy 2 . To demonstrate visualization prostatic vascularity use subharmonic contrast-enhanced imaging . 3 . To provide preliminary estimate diagnostic accuracy contrast-enhanced subharmonic image detection clinically significant PCa . The study include 50 subject schedule prostate biopsy . Each subject receive intravenous infusion microbubble contrast material immediately prior prostate biopsy procedure . The study demonstrate whether subharmonic image microbubble contrast agent allow detection clinically significant prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Detection High Grade Prostate Cancer With Subharmonic Ultrasound Imaging , A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Prostate cancer ( PCa ) frequently diagnose cancer among American male , account 27 % new cancer diagnosis , directly responsible 9.5 % cancer relate death . Two recently publish clinical trial suggest overdiagnosis overtreatment potentially insignificant cancer major drawback prostate cancer screening , point need specific screen tool identify clinically significant prostate cancer . The US-based Prostate , Lung , Colorectal , Ovarian ( PLCO ) Cancer Screening Trial fail show mortality benefit screen treatment prostate cancer . The European Randomized Study Screening Prostate Cancer ( ERSPC ) suggest current standard care , 1410 men must screen 48 additional case prostate cancer treat prevent one death prostate cancer . Based upon trial , U.S. Preventive Services Task Force ( USPSTF ) issue grade `` D '' recommendation PSA-based screen PCa . Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound : Recent study demonstrate contrast-enhanced harmonic imaging ( HI ) identify enhancement related vascular flow high grade PCa , HI selectively detect patient `` clinically significant '' PCa likely benefit therapy . Subharmonic imaging ( SHI ) new technology contrast-enhanced ultrasound image provide 10-fold improvement signal background ratio visualization small vascular structure , previously implement transrectal ultrasound probe . SHI prostate expect advance image prostatic neovascularity improve selective biopsy clinically significant PCa . Objective : To adapt SHI transrectal probe appropriate prostate imaging biopsy ( first 6 month study ) . The subsequent 18 month pilot clinical study enroll 50 participant clinical indication prostate biopsy quantify SHI detection clinically significant PCa ( define : Gleason score ≥ 7 , single core &gt; 50 % involvement , &gt; 25 % biopsy core positive PCa ) . Approach : Each participant undergo transrectal ultrasound evaluation prostate conventional grayscale color Doppler imaging , well contrast-enhanced image color Doppler , HI SHI approach . Imaging result technique record , SHI finding use guide target biopsy prostate . A maximum 6 target biopsy core obtain participant , base upon suspicious area identify SHI . Following targeted biopsy , participant also receive 12-part systematic biopsy consist 6 laterally direct biopsy core 6 medially direct biopsy core . The pilot study design estimate detection clinically significant cancer obtain target biopsy base upon SHI along medially direct systematic sextant biopsy core ( ≤ 12 core total ) .</detailed_description>
