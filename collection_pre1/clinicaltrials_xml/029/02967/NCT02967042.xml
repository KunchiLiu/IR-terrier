	<brief_summary>Chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) increase public health problem number patient chronic kidney disease increase worldwide . Bone abnormalities find almost universally patient CKD require dialysis majority patient CKD stage 3-5 . Chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorder ( CKD-MBD ) complex disorder bone mineral metabolism , associate disorder circulating level hormones development secondary hyperparathyroid disease . The abnormality mineral homeostasis impair bone remodel mineralization result cortical trabecular defect increase fracture risk . There also association increase morbidity mortality . CKD-MBD also associate development calcification blood vessel . During last decade increasingly acknowledge mineral bone disorder contribute excessively high cardiovascular morbidity mortality patient chronic kidney disease . The pathophysiology behind disorder varies lot divide three group ; high turnover renal bone disease , low-turnover disease mixed-uremic osteodystrophy . The treatment CKD-MBD depend subtype disorder . The diagnosis CKD-MBD still challenge . Biomarkers parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) use evaluate bone turnover formation , biomarkers several limitation unspecific . Many biomarkers use research application , yet none clinical use . Dual X ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) use measure fracture risk patient normal kidney function , useful patient chronic kidney disease stage 3 - 5 . Different image technique investigate , still bone biopsy golden standard diagnose classification subtypes CKD-MBD . Bone biopsy invasive available every center . This study ` goal evaluate , 18-Fluor-Positron emission tomography-computed tomography ( 18F-PET-TT ) use assessment CKD patient . The hypothesis 18-PET-TT correlate histomorphometry bone biopsy calcification score CKD patient 18F-PET-TT maybe use diagnostic imaging technique future .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chronic Kidney Disease Bone - Correlation Between 18F-PET-TT Imaging Histomorphometry Bone CKD Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective study recruit patient severely decrease kidney function ( eGRF 20ml/min ) secondary hyperparathyroidism . Also patient receive renal transplant include , hyperparathyroid disease . A control group need validate F18-PET-TT method . The goal include 10-20 patient group 10 person control group . Group I : patient hemodialysis , group II : patient peritoneal dialysis , group III predialysis patient , group IV : patient kidney transplant group V : healthy control . Blood test measure bone formation turnover take normal clinical control patient . Echocardiogram , reasonable sensitive , do detect evaluate valvular calcification . Bone biopsy do day care unit . To obtain information dynamic parameter bone patient double label bone surface , achieve give tetracycline two period . The biopsy take local anesthesia anterior iliac spine vertically . Bone biopsy give possibility evaluate histomorphometry bone diagnose subtypes CKD-MBD . 18F-PET-TT do within one month bone biopsy . PET short half-life bone seek 18F-Sodium Fluoride ( 18F-NaF ) , provide unique way assessment regional bone metabolism . 18F-NaF bind sight new bone formation serve marker bone blood flow osteoblastic activity . A dynamic 18F-PET-TT imaging first do lumbar region spine , follow static PET-TT also measurement calcification score use PET-TT . 18F-NaF injected intravenously direct venipuncture intravenous catheter . All patient also ask permission use DNA-samples need .</detailed_description>
