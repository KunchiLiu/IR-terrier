	<brief_summary>Surgical Site Infections ( SSIs ) wound complication common occurrence follow colorectal resection surgery . Incisional Negative Pressure Wound Therapy ( iNPWT ) develop evidence improve wound complication rate certain population . However , RCTs date look iNPWT use colorectal surgery . We propose study patient randomize one two treatment arm : 1 ) incisional NPWT , 2 ) standard sterile gauze dressing . Patients follow 30 day diagnosis infection wound complication . We compare primary outcome group use Chi-Squared statistical test order report Absolute Risk Reduction Number Needed Treat</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Purpose : To evaluate incisional Negative Pressure Wound Therapy ( iNPWT ) confers low rate Surgical Site Infection ( SSI ) wind complication compare standard treatment elective colorectal resection laparotomy . Justification : Colorectal resection bowel anastomosis clean-contaminated procedure know increased rate wound complication . Techniques like use incisional wound barrier , antimicrobial elude dressing iodine washout assessed attempt reduce occurrence . However , evidence efficacy compel surgeon universally adapt . Meanwhile , negative pressure wound therapy demonstrate impressive efficacy management complex non-healing wound . And recently , NPWT become area interest managing , open wound , close wound well . The benefit therapy yet clearly define elective colorectal resection patient population , however . Null hypothesis : There difference SSI wound complication rate standard iNPWT group . Design : Single-institution , prospective , randomize , open-label , superiority trial Statistical Analysis : Assuming complication rate 20-30 % relative risk reduction 50 % , recruit 400 patient ( 200 group ) achieve power 80 % type 1 error 0.05 . Primary endpoint : Wound Complication - define presence seroma , hematoma , dehiscence , SSI - SSI report independently . Secondary endpoint include : Length Stay , ER visit relate SSI , Complications ( accord Clavien-Dindo classification ) , need duration home care relate wound care , wound VAC specific complication ( local reaction adhesive dressing , blister , failure vacuum , need early removal ) . Primary endpoint assess accord intention-to-treat principle use Pearson 's chi-squared test . In event baseline characteristic significantly different , secondary analysis use multivariable logistic regression adjust effect difference . A p value &lt; 0.05 used determine significance . Results present absolute risk reduction well number need treat prevent one wound complication . Secondary outcome compare use Mann-Whitney U-test non-normally distribute continuous variable chi-squared categorical data .</detailed_description>
