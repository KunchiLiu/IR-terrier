	<brief_summary>During last year , numerous sleep tracker commercialize . They intend give indication sleep quality/duration order give people internet-based feedback sleep . For clinical research purpose , tri-axial accelerometers/multi-sensors device use routinely assess objective sleep quality/patterns . Their use also validate estimate sleep obstructive sleep apnea syndrome ( OSA ) . The purpose present study compare accuracy consumer-level sleep tracker validate tool measure sleep OSA patient .</brief_summary>
