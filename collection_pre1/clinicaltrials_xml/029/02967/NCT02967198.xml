	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether fusion technique preradiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) percutaneous liver biopsy cross-sectional imaging ( CT MR ) real-time ultrasonography would improve feasibility RFA liver biopsy patient liver tumor comparison ultrasonography guidance alone . And assessment new point shear-wave elastography method ( pSWE , S-shear wave ) compare accuracy assess liver stiffness ( LS ) another pSWE technique ( ARFI ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pre-procedure Planning Liver Biopsy Radiofrequency Ablation Using CT MR/US Fusing Imaging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>RFA one commonly use local therapy primary secondary liver tumor . And percutaneous liver biopsy important technique confirm diagnosis focal hepatic lesion whether benign malignancy . For successful safe procedure , safe access route lesion visibility essential , condition usually evaluate pre-procedure planning ultrasonography ( USG ) . However , procedure sometimes abort due limited sonic window various cause challenge identification small isoechoic tumor hepatocellular carcinoma among dysplastic nodule . Therefore , precise target assure safe route would clinical importance . In preliminary study , investigator attempt determine US CT/MR fusion technique would able improve RFA liver biopsy feasibility patient liver tumor comparison conventional US alone technique . In addition , assess intra- inter-observer reproducibility new point shear-wave elastography method ( pSWE , S-shear wave ) compare accuracy assess liver stiffness ( LS ) another pSWE technique ( ARFI ) .</detailed_description>
