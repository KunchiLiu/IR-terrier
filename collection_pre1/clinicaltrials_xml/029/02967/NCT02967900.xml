	<brief_title>Longitudinal Study Chronic Wounds Using Novel Wound Measurement Technologies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetic foot ulcer major burden healthcare system , highly desirable develop practical , reliable , non-invasive mean diagnose , assess measure wound healing , provide wound care specialist key data make effective decision clinical management . Optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) novel technique image cutaneous tissue . Using low-power infrared light , non-invasive in-vivo imaging technique provide resolution &lt; 10microns depth 1 - 1.25 mm skin , ( adequate resolve capillary ) utilize optical scatter characteristic tissue provide image contrast . This open , non-randomised , observational study ass feasibility use OCT diagnose chronic diabetic foot ulcer . One cohort 15 patient scan 16 week period result study determine whether association rate wound heal OCT measurement .</detailed_description>
