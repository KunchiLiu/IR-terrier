	<brief_summary>This study design note whether large safety study use quadrivalent live attenuate influenza vaccine ( LAIV4 ) versus quadrivalent inactivate influenza vaccine ( IIV4 ) ( FLUARIX® ) , would feasible child persistent asthma . Half patient study receive FLUARIX® influenza vaccine , half receive cell culture quadrivalent inactivate influenza vaccine ( ccIIV4 ) ( Flucelvax® ) use surrogate LAIV4 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Influenza Vaccine Feasibility Study Children With Persistent Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The association increase risk wheeze follow receipt live-attenuated influenza vaccine child least 2 year age prior history asthma wheeze remain unclear . The Centers Disease Control Prevention 's Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment ( CISA ) plan address data safety gap regard use LAIV4 vaccine child asthma conduct 3-site randomize , non-inferiority prospective study . The main goal compare safety LAIV4 versus IIV4 child 5-11 year persistent asthma 2016-2017 influenza season . CDC CISA study site develop protocol associate material , poise begin enrollment early 2016-2017 influenza season . However , June 22 , 2016 Advisory Committee Immunization Practices ( ACIP ) vote recommend use LAIV4 2016-2017 influenza season , CDC study investigator decide defer implementing study use LAIV4 2016-2017 influenza season . Investigators reconsider initiate study 2017-2018 influenza season ACIP vote reinstate LAIV4 use new data become available ; ACIP make recommendation annually . The plan LAIV4 study unique feature design previously implement vaccine safety study , include : 1 ) enrol substantial proportion child moderate-severe asthma 2 ) use digital peak flow meter 3 ) collect clinical data multiple , complementary , measure 42 day vaccination . To capitalize progress make development study protocol associate document procedure , CISA propose carry study three site assess feasibility recruiting , enrol , retain , collect clinical data child 5-11 year persistent asthma varied level severity influenza vaccine safety study . Findings propose feasibility study facilitate improve LAIV4 study future go forward CISA Project another venue . In 2016-2017 season , FDA approve new influenza vaccine use person age 4 year old , Flucelvax® Quadrivalent ( ccIIV4 ) ; ACIP incorporate vaccine recommendation 2016-2017 influenza season . Therefore ccIIV4 use place LAIV4 feasibility study . There evidence Flucelvax® increase risk wheeze asthmatic child . The feasibility study also offer opportunity gain additional descriptive safety data new vaccine asthmatic child .</detailed_description>
