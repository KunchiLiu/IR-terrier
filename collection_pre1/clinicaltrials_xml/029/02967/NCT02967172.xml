	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine efficacy safety peri-articular multimodal injection post-operative pain control follow operative management close , rotational ankle fracture . Enrolled subject randomize either receive receive intra-operative injection addition standard opioid analgesic regimen . Patients treat standard care surgical technique treat orthopaedic surgeon patient 's specific fracture pattern . The patient randomize injection cohort receive 25cc intra-operative injection 200 mg ropivacaine , 0.6 mg epinephrine , 5 mg morphine local superficial deep peri-incisional tissue general anesthesia . Total post-operative opioid consumption express morphine equivalent dose record , include IV oral opioids . Time hour operation conclusion discharge discharge disposition ( patient discharge ) also record . Post-operative pain score assess record immediate post-operative period every 4 hour subsequently patient discharge . Medication related side effect monitor . The investigator hypothesize injection cohort reduce pain score , low narcotic requirement , short length stay , likely discharge home follow surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Multimodal Periarticular Injections Operatively Treated Ankle Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Periarticular fracture ( bone break extend joint surface ) treat orthopaedic surgeon associate significant pain post-operative period , often require high dos opioid analgesic . In recent year , high risk misuse , abuse , death associate prescription opioid use become increasingly evident . Although physician advise avoid administration opioid prescription , alternative pain management option limit . Currently , need investigate different pain management model order provide safe effective pain relief post-operative period . The investigator aim evaluate effectiveness peri-incisional multimodal injection alternative post-operative pain control method orthopaedic trauma patient operative ankle fracture . Approximately 200 patient randomize either receive receive intra-operative injection addition standard opioid analgesic regimen . Post-operative pain management outcome assess compare 2 study group determine effectiveness injection . The propose study build upon related work advance post-operative pain control regimens orthopaedic surgery . Goals include reduction unnecessary patient suffering , reliance opioids , length stay , improve patient experience . These aim accomplish expansion currently use multimodal periarticular injection population undergo elective surgery orthopaedic trauma patient rotational ankle fracture . The study design prospective , double-blinded , randomize control trial . Patients include study randomly assign one two treatment group : intra-operative multimodal periarticular injection control ( injection ) . The peri-incisional injection consist ropivacaine , epinephrine , morphine . All pharmacologic agent anesthetic cocktail FDA approve previously use combination type orthopaedic surgery . All patient include study receive standard post-operative opioid analgesic regimen , administer 'per need ' , regardless assign treatment group per study protocol . â‰¥ 40 patient randomly assign group . The patient enrol investigation well health care professional perform post-operative assessment collect data blind treatment allocation . The feasibility multimodal peri-incisional injection support current efficacy population undergo elective orthopedic surgery . These injection may equally effective reduce pain compare regional anesthesia continuous infusion , single-shot nerve block . The investigator hypothesize injection cohort reduce pain score , low narcotic requirement , short length stay , likely discharge home follow surgery .</detailed_description>
