	<detailed_description>AZD7594 non steroidal , potent selective modulator glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) development daily inhale treatment chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) asthma . Inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS ) definitively show decrease rate decline lung function typical COPD . The aim develop AZD7594 well tolerate daily selective inhale GR modulator acceptable side effect profile compare conventional ICS market . Abediterol novel selective β2 adrenergic receptor agonist potential daily treatment asthma COPD fix dose combination ( FDC ) ICS novel anti inflammatory ( AI ) agent Fixed dose ICS/LABA combination treatment effective improving lung function , health status reduce exacerbation individual component . The long term goal abediterol development program COPD investigate monotherapy combination therapy conjunction ICS novel anti inflammatory agent . This study first clinical study combination exposure AZD7594 abediterol 2 compound FDC free combination via 2 separate dry powder inhaler ( DPIs ) . This study conduct healthy male subject minimize effect concomitant disease state medication study measurement . Subjects receive 4 treatment randomize order . Given treatment period single dose AZD7594 , 21 ( ±2 ) day wash adequate prevent carry effect next period . The abediterol elimination half life short AZD7594 . Therefore , 21 ( ±2 ) day wash sufficient elimination AZD7594 abediterol . Overall , pre-clinical clinical data generate date abediterol show expect safety profile , support continue study abediterol .</detailed_description>
