	<brief_summary>Immature platelets—also term reticulate platelet ( RP ) —are platelets newly release circulation , associate variety pathological bleeding event include primary immune thrombocytopenia ( ITP ) . They assess flow cytometry ( FCM ) stain thiazole orange ( TO ) low concentration express fraction total platelet count ( RP % ) . The diagnosis primary ITP base differential diagnosis measurement RP % serve alternative diagnostic test useful daily practice . Our study aim distinguish primary ITP thrombocytopenic disorder , especially aplstic ( hypoplastic ) chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia FCM . The sensitivity specificity assay well agreement RP % measurement monoclonal antibody-specific immobilization platelet antigen ( MAIPA ) analyze accordingly .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator undertake multi-center , prospective blind trial 500 adult thrombocytopenic disorder platelet count less 60*10^9/L 4 medical center China . In brief , 15 μl aliquot anti-coagulated whole blood incubate 70 min 5 μl phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-CD42b monoclonal antibody ( BD Pharmingen , Tokyo , Japan ) 1 ml thiazole orange ( Retic-COUNT ; Becton-Dickinson , San Jose , CA , USA ) dilute 10 time phosphate-buffered saline . RP % analyze flow cytometer ( FACScan , Becton-Dickinson ) measure 10,000 event CD42b-positive fraction . Clinical information participant include gender , age , platelet count definitive diagnosis record exclusive investigator . RP % result reveal end recruitment FCM measurement complete . The agreement clinical diagnosis RP % result analyze identify primary ITP .</detailed_description>
