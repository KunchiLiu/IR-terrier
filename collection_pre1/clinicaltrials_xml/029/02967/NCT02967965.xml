	<detailed_description>In set research ischemic cardiomyopathy , CARIM cohort aim meet expectation strategy Aviesan ( Alliance nationale pour le science de la VIE et de la SANt√© ) since address underlie pathophysiology determinant MI injury impact follow-up , addition potential confound clinical biological factor . Therefore , CARIM cohort offer great opportunity describe interaction myocardial infarction surround environment ( clinical , social professional ) . This cohort use complementary state art approach ( cardiac imaging include Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance echocardiography , biomarkers , proteomic , genetic pharmacogenetics ) strong interaction different partner . Therefore CARIM cohort help obtain modeling determinant MI size . We expect CARIM cohort provide new image biological marker may bring early information regard severity lethal reperfusion injury . By optimize knowledge infarct injury addition 5-year clinical echographic follow-up , cohort well stratify prognosis MI therefore give new insight identify patient high risk leave ventricular remodel subsequent heart failure . It therefore help emphasize prevention message patient ' education . The aim translate information directly patient care use science generate project develop new management guideline novel clinical tool ( confounder-annotated database , image biological biomarkers ) . This cohort may additional impact patient care adapt treatment patient-related confounders ( age , diabetes ... ) , genetic polymorphism thus personalize health care individual . 3.2 MAIN OBJECTIVE Our main objective create prospective cohort 2,000 patient ( CARIM cohort ) first myocardial infarction undergo reperfusion therapy order evaluate impact patient-related confounders myocardial infarct size LRI order design model myocardial infarct size . For purpose , CARIM cohort associate creation non-invasive cardiac image data-bank ( MRI echocardiography ) addition large bio-bank rely exist biological certify platform ( i.e . BRC network ) . This cohort provide population first acute MI , optimally characterize term comprehensive clinical angiography phenotype , specifically characterize CMR term infarct size LRI echocardiography term myocardial regional function leave ventricular remodeling . 3.3 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES 1 . Evaluate specific impact myocardial infarct injury myocardial regional function leave ventricular remodeling ( defined increase LV end-diastolic volume &gt; 20 % week 1 month 12 post-MI echocardiography ) . 2 . Evaluate power myocardial infarct injury predict cardiovascular event ( rehospitalizations , reinfarction , occurrence HF , transplantation , arrhythmia , death ) 5-year patient follow-up . 3 . Test value establish newly identify plasma/serum biomarkers identify LRI predict post-MI LV remodel progression towards CHF 5 year follow-up . 4 . This cohort aim ultimately define profile MI patient population use future trial implement new protective intervention target LRI .</detailed_description>
