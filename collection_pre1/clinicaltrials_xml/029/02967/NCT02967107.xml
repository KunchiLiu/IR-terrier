	<brief_title>Cold Snare Polypectomy Versus Endoscopic Mucosal Resection Colonic Sessile Serrated Polyps</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) third common cancer remain second commonly diagnose malignancy Australia . Colonoscopic polypectomy reduces incidence mortality CRC disrupt adenoma-carcinoma sequence . Screening CRC proven effective reduce mortality morbidity CRC become common practice . Interval cancer ( development CRC within 6 60 month colonoscopy ) occur 6 % patient estimation show 27 % due incomplete adenoma resection . The serrated neoplasia pathway account 20- 30 % sporadic cancer . Serrated precursor lesion think major contributor relative failure colonoscopy prevention proximal colorectal cancer ( CRC ) 5- 7 % CRCs occur period complete colonoscopy prior surveillance , term 'interval ' cancer . In addition difficult detect , sessile serrate polyp ( SSPs ) likely incompletely resect conventional adenoma . The CARE study demonstrate 31 % SSPs remnant tissue resection defect compare 7.2 % conventional adenoma , lesion great 10 mm size , residual tissue remain 47.5 % . SSPs may indistinct margin , small lesion may prove difficult entrap snare flat nature . SSPs also may contain dysplastic focus within lesion , endoscopic appearance indistinguishable conventional adenoma , surround serrate component may overlook incompletely resect recognize . The technique colonoscopic polypectomy continually evolve , lead well outcomes regard polyp detection rate , complete resection rate ( CRR ) polyp , patient comfort , safety cost-efficacy . Although colonoscopy consider 'gold standard ' detect remove polyp , technique still imperfect . Questions best practice polypectomy remain , optimize technique expect lead well patient outcome . The optimal treatment SSPs effective , safe inexpensive . Such lesion remove cold snare polypectomy endoscopic mucosal resection . Cold snare polypectomy ( CSP ) common practice proven safe effective technique removal small polyp ( &lt; 10 mm ) . Because physical characteristic , use thin wire snare lead fast tissue transection ability remove SSP relatively swiftly . The size snare suitable SSP CSP approximately 9 mm . Thus lesion great size would need remove one piece , introduce possibility incomplete resection . Endoscopic mucosal resection ( EMR ) well establish laterally spread colorectal lesion . It involve submucosal injection diathermy assist snare resection piecemeal en-bloc depend polyp size . En bloc resection possible lesion 20 mm facilitates histopathological evaluation . EMR time consume CSP may associate diathermy related complication postpolypectomy bleeding , perforation pain . The efficient safe method removal SSP establish .</detailed_description>
