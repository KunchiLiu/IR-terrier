	<brief_title>Physical Activity After Normal Spontaneous Cesarean Delivery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cesarean delivery common surgery perform United States . Despite fact , paucity literature look implementation enhance recovery surgery ( ERAS ) patient undergo type surgery . ERAS protocols show improve recovery surgery , decrease complication hospital length stay . The pathway enhance recovery target improve 3 factor associate increased hospital length stay complication . These factor pain , immobilization postoperative ileus . These factor , many time inter-related . A patient pain would tend ambulate may exacerbate pain discomfort . In order alleviate pain , patient would likely receive opioid pain management medication know undesirable side effect nausea , vomit , sedation , respiratory depression , constipation urinary retention . All adverse effect ( AEs ) may lead complication increase hospital length stay . To best investigator knowledge average level physical activity ( PA ) parturients recover cesarean delivery normal spontaneous vaginal delivery ( NSVD ) remain unknown . Taking consideration parturients hypercoagulable state obstetric venous thromboembolism ( VT ) one common cause maternal morbidity mortality , ambulation utmost importance anesthesiologist well obstetrician . In order promote mobility , first need learn average parturients level physical acuity immediate post-partum period 48 hour delivery . This information may help u promote mobility immediate postpartum period , particularly underwent cesarean delivery since high risk VT . Given lack knowledge regard physical activity level parturients postpartum period , investigator design pilot study objectively measure PA . Patients normal spontaneous vaginal delivery serve control group . These patient go physiologic change counterpart ( CD patient ) go , difference stress surgery CD group.The use Fitness tracker ( i.e Fitbit ( R ) , Actigraph GT3X + ) use measure promote physical activity cardiac rehabilitation population , well parturients self-identified inactive . The investigator intend use Actigraph GT3X+ measure level physical activity 50 parturients ( 25 NSVD 25 post CD ) . The information obtain , help u tailor anesthetic/analgesic management parturients way promote early ambulation recovery . The investigator estimate need approximately total 50 patient , 25 per group ass difference level PA parturients NSVD CD . We aim recruit 60 patient 30 per group account miss data , protocol violation , equipment malfunction patient drop outs.This pilot , prospective study aim measure physical activity ( PA ) American Society Anesthesiologists ( ASA ) Classification I II woman age 18 year old , normal spontaneous vaginal ( NSVD ) cesarean delivery ( CD ) . Subjects ASA I II woman age 18 year old , know either NSVD CD ( neuraxial anesthesia ) . After delivery , assure mother baby stable , patient approach member study team discus study obtain informed consent . After obtain informed consent , patient divide Two ( 2 ) group depend mode delivery . Group 1 NSVD group 2 CD patient . Patients provide fitbit- base Actigraph GT3X + hardware , 3 hour delivery . Patients evaluate every 12 hour delivery period 48 hour . During evaluation point , pain ( visual analogue score ) , factor affect mobility , level satisfaction analgesia assess . After 48 hour Actigraph GT3X + interrogate objective data , mean daily step daily MET min-1 , obtain use aforementioned software .</detailed_description>
