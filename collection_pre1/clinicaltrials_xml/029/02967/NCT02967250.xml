	<detailed_description>The objective study understand bioenergetic impairment underlie Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) evaluate treatment may improve abnormal mitochondrial function present PD . High field - 7 tesla ( T ) - magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) able non-invasively ass change brain energetics used evaluate effect repeat oral dos mitochondrial enhancer ursodeoxycholic acid ( UDCA ) brain bioenergetics derive MRS measurement . This study combine result obtain use MRS brain scan along peripheral measurement bile acid ( e.g. , total UDCA ) . This research require least 2 visit : baseline evaluation approximately 6 week subject stable oral dose 4 week . Participants provide medical history first visit , undergo physical examination rating scale visit ( duration : ~1 hour ) well brain MRI scan ( 1-1.5 hour ) . Blood obtain visit monitor adverse effect well ass change bile acid orally administer UDCA . If additional funding obtain may another visit add first second assessment obtain additional blood measurement MRS data . Since extensive animal cell model data support rationale therapeutic trial UDCA PD , MRS methods non-invasively detect change brain chemistry propose study evaluate effect 4-6 week high-dose oral UDCA central ( brain ) peripheral measure ( MRS blood measurement , respectively ) individual PD healthy control . The hypothesis specific aim follow : Hypothesis : Repeated oral dose UDCA result increase brain ATP level individual Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) . Specific Aims : 1 . Measure plasma UDCA level individual PD baseline four week repeat high dos oral UDCA ( 50mg/kg/day ) . 2 . Measure cortical bioenergetic profile ATPase activity ( ascertain MRS ) PD baseline four week repeat high dos oral UDCA ( 50mg/kg/day ) simultaneously Aim 1 . Secondary Aims : 1 . Characterize oral UDCA pharmacokinetics 2 . Develop pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model characterize relationship peripheral measurement UDCA ( associate conjugate ) peripheral measure and/or central ( brain ) bioenergetic measurement .</detailed_description>
