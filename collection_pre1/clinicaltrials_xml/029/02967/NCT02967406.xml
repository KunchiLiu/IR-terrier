	<detailed_description>This community-based cluster randomize control trial aim investigate impact lifestyle modification ( diet , physical activity , alcohol drinking smoking ) development dementia , diabetes , chronic kidney disease , cancer , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease cardiovascular disease intermediate risk population mix urban-rural area Ubon Ratchathani . Objectives : 1. examine impact lifestyle modification development dementia , diabetes , chronic kidney disease , cancer , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease cardiovascular disease intermediate risk population Ubon Ratchathani 2. examine economic impact lifestyle modification prevention dementia , diabetes , chronic kidney disease , cancer , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease cardiovascular disease intermediate risk population Ubon Ratchathani Study design : community-based cluster randomize control trial Setting : 60 village randomly select mixed urban-rural area 15 district Ubon Ratchathani province . Study population : 3,600 apparently healthy men woman age 45-75 year reside village select least one year . 4,000 men woman approach screen . Screening baseline assessment : After community consent , potential participant inform detail project . For willing participate , write informed consent give carry research procedure . Participants question demographic characteristic , medical family history , health behaviour include diet , physical activity , alcohol drinking smoking . Physical activity ass use Global Physical Activity Questionnaire ( GPAQ ) diet assess use 24 hour food recall . Their cognitive function assess use Mini-Mental State Exam ( MMSE ) , Thai version , clock draw test depression test also perform . Physical examination include weight , height , blood pressure , waist hip circumference well physical fitness test . Fasting blood sample collect follow laboratory test : Complete blood count , creatinine , estimate glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) , fast plasma glucose , glycated haemoglobin ( HbA1c ) , total cholesterol , triglyceride , HDL estimate LDL-cholesterol , serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase ( SGOT ) , serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase ( SGPT ) , thyroid stimulate hormone ( TSH ) , Ca++ , PO4- , urine creatinine/albumin , urine sodium &amp; potassium . Interventions : Participants 30 village intervention group give 4x4 lifestyle modification intervention , address four health behavior ( diet , physical activity , alcohol drinking smoking ) four different level : individual , household , knowledge management community level . A new computer program call 'iActive ' use . The program adapt GPAQ add-on function allow real-time assessment presentation energy expenditure along recommendation specific individual . Dietary counseling give individually follow assessment use new dietary assessment program call Dietary Assessment Scanning Calculator ( DISC ) . Home visit do every 3 month responsible nurse village health volunteer order assess give simple counsel health behavior . Knowledge management undertaken meeting forums participant village support train nurse . Situation analysis agree community action encourage address community problem concern four health behavior . A combination intensive intervention give 3 year . Follow-up outcome ascertainment : Participants follow 1 , 2 , 5 10 year baseline assessment development outcomes interest . In follow-up , procedure identical baseline assessment do . Primary outcome : Incident dementia Incident dementia ascertain battery screen test ( MMSE , clock draw depression test ) abnormal test result refer neuro-medicine specialist regional hospital investigation diagnosis . Secondary outcome : 1 . Type 2 diabetes mellitus 2. chronic kidney disease 3. cancer 4. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 5. cardiovascular disease 6. body mass index 7. waist circumference 8. blood pressure 9 . Fasting plasma glucose 10 . HbA1c 11 . Lipids ( total cholesterol , triglyceride , HDL estimate LDL ) Tertiary outcome : 1 . MMSE score Cognitive decline 2 . Alzheimer 's disease 3 . Physical activity level 4 . Dietary intake 5. prevalence current smoker 6. prevalence alcohol consumption</detailed_description>
