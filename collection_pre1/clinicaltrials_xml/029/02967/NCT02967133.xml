	<brief_summary>The optimal prioritization second-line chemotherapy immune therapy base demographic biomarker data area ongoing investigation . The hypothesis study may additive synergistic antitumor effect combine chemotherapy nivolumab second-line treatment NSCLC important concept test clinical trial . Previously treat NSCLC remain set unmet clinical need despite recent clinical research progress . Early progression subset NSCLC patient receive nivolumab specific area clinical need .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Nivolumab +/- Nab-paclitaxel Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nab-paclitaxel add standard nivolumab therapy previously treat advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer help prevent early progression improve progression free survival . The primary endpoint determine addition nab-paclitaxel nivolumab improves progression free survival compare nivolumab alone . Retrospective study conduct analyze blood base immune biomarkers , tumor biomarkers well understand effect nivolumab combine chemotherapy immune system NSCLC . Patients advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer progression cancer receive platinum doublet chemotherapy randomize receive nivolumab without nab-paclitaxel . Patients arm receive maximum one year therapy option retreat progression .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Histologically cytologically confirm , Stage IV nonsmall cell lung cancer ( per Union Internationale contre le Cancer/American Join Committee Cancer stag system , 7th edition ) recurrent incurable nonsmall cell lung cancer progress firstline chemotherapy . 2 . Prior Therapy : Platinum doublet chemotherapy current diagnosis advance lung cancer . Only one prior line chemotherapy advance lung cancer allow . Adjuvant chemotherapy , neoadjuvant chemotherapy , chemoradiotherapy give early stage lung cancer least 6 month prior diagnosis recurrent/metastatic disease count line therapy advance lung cancer . Patients receive platinum doublet therapy without radiotherapy part treatment early stage nonsmall cell lung cancer le 6 month develop stage 4 recurrent incurable disease consider study eligible criterion receive one line chemotherapy nonsmall cell lung cancer . 3 . EGFR , ALK ROS biomarker positive tumor eligible long patient receive least one standard oral , molecular inhibitor therapy addition standard platinum doublet chemotherapy . More one molecular inhibitor allow first generation EGFR inhibitor follow next generation EGFR inhibitor T790 mutation develop . Prior molecular therapy biomarker positive tumor ( limit ) MET , RET BRAF allow require . 4 . Prior chemotherapy must complete 21 day prior initiation protocol therapy toxicity must &lt; grade 2 . 5 . Patients must &lt; Grade 2 preexist neuropathy ( per CTCAE ) . 6 . Palliative radiation must complete 2 week prior initiation study therapy . 7 . All patient must measurable disease . Measurable disease define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) ≥ 20mm conventional technique ≥10mm spiral CT scan . 8 . ECOG Performance Status : 01 9 . Second malignancy : No `` currently active '' second malignancy nonmelanoma skin cancer . 10 . Brain metastasis : brain metastasis must treat least 2 week prior enrollment , asymptomatic brain metastasis , stable brain imaging , receive supraphysiologic dose steroid ( &gt; 10 mg prednisone daily equivalent ) . 11 . Nonpregnant nonnursing . The effect nabpaclitaxel nivolumab fetus unknown . 12 .

An archival tumor sample either prior core needle biopsy surgical specimen must available submit correlative study eligibility requirement prior registration . The sample must ship within 6 week enrollment . Participants without available archival tumor sample consider ineligible . 1 . Prior nabpaclitaxel chemotherapy exclude . 2 . Prior immune therapy NSCLC exclude . Patients exclude prior treatment antiPD1 , antiPDL1 , anti PDL2 , antiCTLA4 antibody , antibody drug specifically target Tcell costimulation immune checkpoint pathway . 3 . Patients exclude active , know suspected autoimmune disease . Subjects permit enroll vitiligo , type I diabetes mellitus , residual hypothyroidism due autoimmune condition require hormone replacement , psoriasis require systemic treatment , condition expect recur absence external trigger . 4 .
