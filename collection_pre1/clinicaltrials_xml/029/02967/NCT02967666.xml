	<brief_summary>PET/MRI ( positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance image ) somatostatin analog tracer potential provide image technique target subclinical granulomatous disease latent tuberculosis ( TB ) , allow identification individual may risk progression active TB .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation PET/MRI Using Somatostatin Analog Tracer Novel Approach Detecting Pathology High Risk TB-exposed Contacts</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Granulomas , hallmark TB infection , increase density somatostatin receptor . Somatostatin analog PET tracer , 68Ga-DOTANOC , bind somatostatin receptor able detect pulmonary TB lesion use PET/MRI . This study aim well understand pathology spectrum latent TB use 68Ga-DOTANOC PET/MRI imaging , identify individual subclinical pulmonary TB may risk progress active TB . Currently , biomarkers identify risk develop active TB limit . Non-invasive biomarkers pulmonary lesion sorely need image 68Ga-DOTANOC PET/MRI provide opportunity detect subclinical pulmonary disease close contact smear-positive pulmonary TB .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Age 21 year 2 . Close household contact patient newlydiagnosed ( within last 2 month ) smear positive pulmonary TB ( close contact define sleep house least one month TB patient prior start treatment ) . 3 . Interferon Gamma Release Assay ( IGRA ) positive 4 . Willing comply study visit procedures 5 . Willing able provide write informed consent 1 . Previous treatment TB disease 2 . Diabetes , judgment investigator , poorly control would prevent adequate PET scan 3 . Cardiac pacemaker , aneurysm clip metallic implant consider unsafe MRI 4 . Occupation involve substantial exposure radiation 5 . Malignancy require chemotherapy radiation 6 . Known lung disease may affect interpretation scan 7 . Known chronic kidney disease 8 .
