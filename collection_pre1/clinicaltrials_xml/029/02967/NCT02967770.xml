	<brief_title>Molecularly Tailored Therapy Standard Care Second-Line Therapy Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open label , randomize Phase II trial patient metastatic pancreatic cancer . The trial design compare outcome ( primary endpoint progression-free survival ( PFS ) ) patient receive molecularly-tailored therapy ( MTT ) receive physician discretion standard care ( SOC ) . To successfully allow assessment , minimize confound variable , investigator need ensure : - There enough tissue molecular profiling occur . Thus , patient tumor deposit clearly amenable serial biopsy allow enroll . - There enough time molecular profiling complete ; medical review panel ( MRP ) render determination optimal molecularly-guided therapy ; treat physician obtain access therapy , particularly MRP-determined therapy include off-label treatment OR clinical trial . It anticipate process take minimum 4 week . These factor inevitably lead selection bias towards patient good prognosis . However , randomization design mitigate selection bias . Patients metastatic pancreatic cancer actively first-line therapy , meet inclusion exclusion criterion detailed Section 3 enrol . For enrolled patient , time enrollment ( first-line therapy ) , treat physician ask submit plan second line SOC treatment he/she would recommend . Patients undergo tumor biopsy , detailed next . If patient undergoes tumor biopsy his/her disease progress first-line therapy prior MRP-determined therapeutic plan , patient consider screen failure , replace . Then , patient adequate tissue available profiling , MRP-determined therapeutic plan develop . This process determine MRP-determined therapeutic plan keep blinded treating physician ( i.e . treat physician NOT involve determination MTT his/her patient ) - plan available , patient randomize either MTT SOC ( See Figure 4 ) : Patients monitor closely first-line therapy . For patient randomize MTT , MRP-determined therapeutic plan unblinded treat physician , preparation MTT begin , include acquire access label therapy , require . Patients randomize SOC therapy receive SOC treatment initially recommend treat physician Once patient experience disease progression first-line therapy , receive MTT vs. SOC second-line therapy , accord randomization . Patients group receive second-line therapy disease progression therapy intolerance ( dose schedule modification need ) . Response assessment occur approximately every 8 week ( base calendar ) determine time initiation therapy . All patient option undergo repeat tumor biopsy upon disease progression . Once patient SOC therapy experience progressive disease second-line therapy , MRP-determined therapeutic plan unblinded treat physician , MTT therapy administer third-line therapy ( crossover MTT ) . Third-line therapy also incorporate correlative analysis patient tumor sample test ex vivo ( detail ) result available time third line therapy require . As may impact overall survival assessment , primary endpoint disease progression 4 month ( PFS4mos ) , primary objective compare PFS4mos MTT treat vs. SOC treat patient . The investigator hypothesize MTT improve PFS4mos 50 % SOC ( base historical data ) , ≥75 % . It anticipate 80 % power detect improvement PFS4mos 50 % ≥75 % ( hazard ratio ( HR ) = 0.5 ) , assume 1-sided significance level 0.05 accrual rate 4 patient per month ( see statistic ) . Of note , treat physician may opt incorporate molecular data select third-line therapy patient whose disease progress second-line MTT therapy . The result ongoing analysis test patient tumor sample , ex vivo include conditionally reprogrammed cell ( CRCs ) , organoids , zebrafish avatar may available time patient require third-line therapy . If , treat physician may incorporate result analyse decision plan third-line therapy . These patient continue follow longitudinally survival , formal comparison third line therapy outcomes `` crossover '' group .</detailed_description>
