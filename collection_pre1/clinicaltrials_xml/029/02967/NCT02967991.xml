	<detailed_description>3 BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE Chronic liver disease number cause , lead significant mortality morbidity United States . It estimate roughly 36,000 individual die annually burden chronic liver disease , thus early diagnosis intervention paramount prevent complication . Though serologic marker non-invasive diagnostic imaging modality use method determine underlying disease process , method lack specificity determine etiology patient 's chronic liver disease . Therefore , liver biopsy remain `` gold standard '' obtain valuable diagnostic prognostic information . At present exist several method liver tissue acquisition . The widely accept method remain percutaneous route ( PLB ) , utilizes percussion image localization biopsy site . The issue approach potential complication post-procedural pain 84 % , bleed 1/2500-10,000 procedure , 1/10,000 case fatal . Another mean obtain tissue sample transjugular route ( TLB ) , also allow portal pressure measurement , usually reserve patient coagulopathy . More recently , endoscopic ultrasound guide liver biopsy ( EUS-LB ) develop new LB technique . The feasibility EUS-LB liver lesion validate yield excellent diagnostic result several study . This technique also evaluate hepatic parenchymal disease 90 % diagnostic yield . Subsequently , EUS-LB use 19-gauge needle compare percutaneous/transjugular route show least comparative , instance improve sample acquisition , versus method . Different 19-gauge needle utilized set yield variable diagnostic specimen . However , yet comparison 19 versus 22-gauge core biopsy needle EUS-LB . The safety profile 19g needle remarkably good ; seem logical small needle would least good , good . Primary End Points 1 . Proportion case histologic diagnosis could make base upon amount tissue obtain needle . 2 . Number portal tract ( PT ) specimen 3 . Aggregate specimen length ( ASL ) , length long piece ( LLP ) , degree fragmentation Secondary End Points 1 . Presence visible core specimen 2 . Presence visible clot specimen 3 . Adverse event ( AE ) serious adverse event ( SAE ) 4 HYPOTHESIS AND SPECIFIC aim 4.1 Hypothesis The investigator predict 19-gauge needle 22-gauge core needle similar ability obtain adequate EUS-LB specimen 4.2 Specific Aim 1 To determine adequacy EUS-LB use 22-gauge core needle compare 19-gauge needle 4.3 Specific Aim 2 To determine 22-gauge core needle demonstrate less blood artifact time EUS-LB compare 19-gauge needle . 6 STUDY DESIGN 6.1 Description This prospective trial compare biopsy specimen adequacy 19 versus 22-gauge core needle EUS-LB . 6 6.3 Recruitment Patients shall recruit pre-procedural endoscopy area . After identify subject , study investigator shall discuss study detail either person ( point patient read consent form ) . A second individual witness consent . 6.4 Study Duration 6.4.1 Approximate Duration Subject Participation Participation study 1 week post-procedure . 6.4.2 Approximate Duration Study The duration study shall last 6 month enrollment last study participant . This shall allow analysis final data point construction manuscript . 6.5 Procedures Epic electronic health record database allow availability demographic data office-based follow-up record . Provation MD software information provide detail regard endoscopic parameter intervention perform . Electronic record gather study purpose available study investigator store encrypted hard drive computer . Data initially enter protected health information ( PHI ) attach information obtain . Once data collection complete identifier remove random number assign patient . Paper copy study questionnaire fill endoscopy center store locked cabinet endoscopy center workroom . The door workroom cabinet lock hour endoscopy center lock hour well . Upon initial encounter , study shall describe patient detail one study investigator inform consent obtain . Once patient agree participate , demographic data obtain include ; age , gender , height [ inch ( ) ] , weight [ pound ( lb ) ] , body mass index ( BMI ) ( lb/in2 ) , past medical history [ particular diagnosis liver disease , biliary pancreatic disease , ascites , encephalopathy , portal hypertension , portal hypertension-related bleeding ( ie . varix ) , liver cancer mass ] . Past surgical history shall obtain regard prior cholecystectomy , hepatobiliary pancreatic surgery ( i.e . pancreaticojejunostomy ) bariatric surgery ( ie . Roux-en-Y gastric bypass ) . Medication social history shall perform regard alcohol intake per week hepatotoxic medication ( i.e . acetaminophen ) . A baseline INR platelet count shall perform individual prior EUS-LB , standard care . EUS-LB Protocol Patients undergo EUS-LB receive sedation prior procedure , per normal practice . This provide certified registered nurse anesthetist ( CRNA ) . The endosonographic study conduct linear array echoendoscope ( GF-UC140-AL5 ; Olympus America , Center Valley , PA ) . Before needle puncture desire lobe , color Doppler imaging use ensure lack vascular structure trajectory needle . The EUS-LB perform widely separate region liver use 19-gauge EUS-FNA ( fine needle aspiration ) needle ( Expect Flexible 19g , Boston Scientific , Marlborough , MA ) 22-gauge FNB needle ( SharkCore , Beacon Endoscopic , Sunnyvale , CA , Acquire 22g , Boston Scientific , Marlborough , MA ) . A computer-generated randomized schema shall determine initial needle gauge selection . The left lobe describe liver parenchyma identify centimeter gastroesophageal junction echoendoscope torqued clockwise . The right lobe consider large area liver tissue see duodenal bulb , near gallbladder . The stylet remove , heparin flush needle lumen , suction device set attach needle hub . The prepared needle insert echoendoscope , A transgastric approach use obtain sample leave lobe liver ; transduodenal approach , linear echoendoscope position duodenal bulb , use obtain sample large amount liver parenchyma see location . Once adequate liver parenchymal penetration achieve needle ( ∼2-6 cm ) , full suction apply 20-mL vacuum syringe . One pas consist total 7 10 to-and-fro needle motion fan technique apply direct continuous endosonographic visualization tip needle . The needle remove echoendoscope . The specimen push needle stylet directly microsieve , blood wash specimen gentle saline rinse . The endosonographer look multiple piece light brown tissue approximately 5 15 mm length . The tissue core `` float '' microsieve formalin solution . Then , second pas make region liver use alternate needle use first pas . Heparin flush needle lumen prior next pas . The biopsy process repeat opposite liver lobe . Two pass per liver lobe make ; one standard 19g EUS-FNA needle , one 22g EUS core needle . All patient closely observed recovery area 1 hour procedure , per standard policy . Patients followed-up phone call next day 1 week procedure . Sample Processing The surgical pathology department , per specific protocol clinical practice , process EUS-LB sample . Tissue sample leave formalin least 1 hour processing . The content formalin jar pour petri dish , visible core liver tissue pick small forceps surgical pathology technician . These piece arrange linear fashion lens paper , specimen photograph alongside ruler estimate pre-processing tissue length . Samples lob different needle submit evaluation separately . The tissue process standard fashion , slide blank make ( 5-μm tissue thickness ) . These blank stain hematoxylin eosin , trichrome , reticulin , special stain do need . The slide digitize use whole slide scanner ( ScanScope CS ; Aperio Technologies , Inc , Vista , CA ) , digitize image use quantitative analysis ( eSlide Manager ; Aperio Technologies , Inc ) . Quantification sample length ( mm ) portal triad perform 2 investigator , annotate digital image software . Fellowship-trained GI pathologist perform histologic interpretation clinical use . Post-Procedural Follow-up After undergoing procedure , patient receive 1week follow-up phone call monitor adverse event ( i.e . bleeding ) .</detailed_description>
