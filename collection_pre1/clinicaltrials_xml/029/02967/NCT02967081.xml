	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether dentinal fluid ( tooth fluid ) teeth without painful inflammatory condition nerve ( pulp ) contain inflammatory marker .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Dentinal Fluid Presence Matrix Metalloproteinase 9 ( MMP-9 ) Pulpal Inflammation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : The aim study use improve sample method collection MMP-9 test hypothesis MMP-9 level significantly elevate dentinal fluid symptomatic ( painful ) human permanent teeth compare asymptomatic counterpart need replacement filling , pulp necrotic teeth . Moreover , dynamic MMP-9 expression removal causative stimulus pulpitis investigate . Outcome : Measuring total MMP-9 level dentinal fluid collect dental treatment use human MMP-9 fluorescent assay . Measurements procedure : Patients attend day service Center Dental Medicine Zurich screen . Patients match inclusion criterion ask participate study . Upon write informed consent , affect tooth get anesthetize , isolated rubber dam receive one follow treatment procedure : caries removal restoration , tooth fill replacement restoration , root canal treatment ( irreversible pulpitis , pulp necrosis ) . After caries removal , removal defect tooth filling , access cavity preparation , cellulose membrane ( paper point ) apply blunt end dentin 1 min collect dentinal fluid . The cellulose membrane store laboratory analysis . Depending individual treatment plan patient , tooth subsequently receive root canal treatment , final restoration , temporization glass-ionomer cement coverage dentinal wound reinforcement remain tooth structure . Final restoration tooth composite , partial crown , full-coverage crown technically demand , time consuming , frequently involve multiple patient visit . Teeth receive root canal treatment , final restoration sample . When patient temporize tooth return final restoration , sample procedure ( appliance cellulose membrane dentin 1 min storage analysis ) repeat . Any treatment continue without impairment . The investigation alter treatment plan patient ( either participate one , two sampling procedure , study ) . Number participant : Based previously perform study ( Zehnder et al. , 2011 ) , use similar experimental set-up 31 participant ( 2 group ) , aim recruit 60 participant current study . Comparators : MMP-9 level dentinal fluid sample teeth painful ( irreversible ) pulpitis compare MMP-9 level teeth without clinical sign symptom . Moreover , MMP-9 level teeth show painless pulpitis ( teeth affect caries lesion ) compare repeated sample tooth collect removal caries lesion . Statistical analysis : MMP-9 content clinical sample determine standard curve ( 4-parameter logistic curve fit ) obtain recombinant pro-MMP-9 standard dilution series . Values group compare use Mann-Whitney U test , alpha-type error set 0.05 .</detailed_description>
