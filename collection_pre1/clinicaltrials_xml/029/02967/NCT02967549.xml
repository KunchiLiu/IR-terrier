	<brief_title>Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist v Proportional Assist Ventilation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite improvement survival rate extremely preterm born infant , incidence bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD ) remain unchanged last two decade . As invasive ventilation frequently necessary indeed life saving , numerous ventilator strategy develop reduce damage develop lung . Synchronisation mechanical breath patient 's respiratory effort offer theoretical benefit improve oxygenation ventilation , require low ventilator pressure , few air leak increase patient comfort . Recently , novel mode ventilation introduce aim improve upon conventional ventilation . During proportional assist ventilation ( PAV ) neurally-adjusted ventilatory assist ( NAVA ) , respiratory support servo-controlled base continuous input baby 's respiratory effort . Both aim improve synchronization time respiratory cycle also vary level support offer breath-to-breath proportion respiratory effort patient . During proportional assist ventilation ( PAV ) , ventilator vary inflation pressure phase volume change flow change order offload elastic resistive component work breathe . We previously show PAV , compare ACV , reduce oxygenation index improve respiratory muscle strength infant bear prematurely remain ventilated beyond one week life . Neurally adjusted ventilatory assist ( NAVA ) utilise electrical activity diaphragm trigger ventilator . A modified nasogastric feeding tube series electrodes allows monitor diaphragmatic electromyogram ( Edi ) . The waveform Edi use trigger control ventilator support . We recently show NAVA compare ACV result low oxygenation index infant bear prematurely remain ventilated beyond one week life . Both PAV NAVA show advantage conventional triggered ventilation neonate , compare . Our aim determine whether NAVA PAV effective prematurely bear neonate evolve establish BPD .</detailed_description>
