	<detailed_description>This randomize controlled trial mupirocin treatment MSSA- MRSA-colonized infant aim determine whether mupirocin treatment result S. aureus decolonization affect NICU patient . MSSA- MRSA-colonized patient enroll study randomize either treatment group ( treatment mupirocin ) control group ( treatment placebo ) . A combination active surveillance target decolonization qualitatively quantitatively enable assessment change S. aureus colonization study patient . The primary outcome measure number MSSA/MRSA patient colonization day treatment versus control group . Secondary outcome measure include proportion persistently colonize patient subsequent weekly screening interval treatment versus control group , incidence timing MSSA/MRSA recolonization treatment group , incidence invasive infection S. aureus treatment versus control group , incidence mupirocin-resistance treatment versus control group , incidence MSSA/MRSA colonization NICU discharge treatment versus control group . STUDY PROCEDURES Current standard care NICU include active universal screening admit patient weekly MSSA/MRSA colonization contact precaution MRSA-positive patient . No universal target decolonization procedure currently utilize . NICU patient screen positive MSSA/MRSA colonization approach participation study consent obtain parent within 2 day initial positive screening result neonatologist . At time enrollment , patient randomize either treatment control group . The pharmacy team assign randomization ; NICU staff blind patient 's study group assignment throughout admission . The treatment group receive mupirocin ointment apply twice daily inside naris skin around umbilicus five day . The control group receive placebo ointment ( petroleum jelly ) apply identical fashion . The control group receive mupirocin ointment time , regardless colonization status . If patient recurrent positive MSSA/MRSA screen study , may receive additional identical course treatment either mupirocin placebo base study group assignment . The mupirocin placebo petroleum jelly ointment supply Crouse Hospital pharmacy send NICU daily twice daily application nursing staff . Both group receive ½ inch ribbon topical application mupirocin petroleum jelly ointment accord assignment around umbilicus ½ inch ribbon inside nare . The neonatal nursing staff receive appropriate education regard application technique study protocol prior study initiation . The cost mupirocin placebo ointment pay Neonatal Associates Central New York , LLC , patient receive fee service . Colonization MSSA/MRSA screen weekly Mondays , line current Crouse Hospital NICU standard care . MSSA/MRSA screen performed polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) . Sample collection involve swab infant 's naris , umbilicus , groin cotton-tipped applicator . The swab tip send Crouse Hospital Laboratory Staphylococcus species identification . There additional cost associated screening , already standard care . Mupirocin resistance assess disk diffusion assay E-test methodology determine MICs . The cost associate additional test pay Neonatal Associates Central New York , LLC , patient receive fee service . An additional MSSA/MRSA screen perform approximately 2 month discharge patient 's primary care physician ' office visit . Sample collection procedure identical screen perform Crouse , screen sent Laboratory Alliance Central New York 's Microbiology Department test . Results make available principal investigator . The cost associate additional outpatient screen test pay Neonatal Associates Central New York , LLC , patient receive fee service . Routine Crouse Hospital NICU policy regard use contact precaution MRSA colonize infant continue study period . If infant enrol study display sign symptom concern infection , diagnostic evaluation treatment guide attend neonatologist , deviate current NICU standard care . Parents notify infant screen positive MRSA colonization diagnostic evaluation perform infant . Current standard infection prevention , aggressive consistent hand hygiene , sterile procedure policy , etc . continue study . Baseline patient demographic clinical characteristic outcomes collect every study subject , include : birth weight , sex , gestational age , birth hospital , mode delivery , maternal age , length rupture membrane , chorioamnionitis , document maternal MRSA history available , maternal antibiotic exposure , maternal drug abuse history , respiratory support throughout hospitalization , central line access , number day TPN , maternal breast milk and/or formula use , gavage feeding , surgery , grade III/IV intraventricular hemorrhage ( IVH ) , necrotizing enterocolitis ( NEC ) , spontaneous intestinal perforation ( SIP ) , clinical condition gestational age time infectious evaluation , description positive infection ( cerebrospinal fluid , blood , urine , pustule , abscess , osteomyelitis , endocarditis ) , antibiotic exposure ( agent , antibiotic day ) , length hospital stay , discharge disposition , MSSA/MRSA colonization screen result . The number MSSA/MRSA patient colonization day determine compare treatment control group . The proportion persistently colonize , decolonize , recolonized study subject subsequent weekly screening interval study group determine compare . The incidence timing MSSA/MRSA recolonization follow decolonization mupirocin determine . The incidence nosocomial sepsis invasive infection organisms determine compare two group . The incidence mupirocin resistance group compare . The incidence MSSA/MRSA colonization discharge base outpatient screening compare . An independent study monitor committee , compose pharmacist attend neonatologist ( principal investigator ) , meet first 30 patient enrol periodically first review ensure safety study protocol duration study . Rates S. aureus colonization infection study period also compare historical rate Crouse Hospital NICU ensure largely unanticipated change study period . All study data compile electronic database , keep secure password-protected computer principal investigator 's locked office ninth floor Crouse Hospital . The study subject ' personal health information include name , date birth , medical record number use identify subject , study information part medical record . A copy data collection form data analysis form submit along protocol application . STATISTICAL METHODS , DATA ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION Statistical analyse include descriptive phase ass frequency variables analytic phase evaluate association methicillin-sensitivity resistance status patient 's gestational age , gender , birth weight , discharge diagnosis , discharge disposition , length NICU stay , presence/type underlying condition , treatment , clinical outcome . Pearson 's X2 test use compare categorical variable counts/frequencies treatment control group . The two-sample t-test use continuous variable normal distribution test difference mean . Appropriate alternative , Wilcoxon rank sum , use data violate t-test assumption . The two-proportion z-test use assess difference two proportion . All hypothesis test 2-tailed P ≤ 0.05 consider statistically significant . An analyst statistical support involve study design , power analysis , sample size calculation . She remain involved throughout study period assist data analysis . Neonatal MSSA/MRSA patient colonization day data Crouse Hospital NICU use sample size calculation . Approximately 12-15 new case MSSA- MRSA-colonization occur month , mean 21.5 patient colonization day ( standard deviation 20 day ) . A two-sample t-test 95 % confidence interval , power 80 , hypothesize reduction 40 % ( 8 patient colonization day ) , suggest sample size 98 patient per group , total approximately 200 patient study . All study personnel , aside pharmacy staff randomize patient , blind regard patient ' study group allocation discharge Crouse Hospital NICU . At time discharge , pharmacy notify principal investigator patient 's study group allocation data analysis treatment group occur .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Infants admit Crouse Hospital NICU MSSA/MRSA colonization parental consent participation obtain within 2 day initial positive screen . Any infant active previous S. aureus infection time initial positive S. aureus colonization screen . Any infant condition think fatal/irreversible ( pulmonary hypoplasia , chromosomal/genetic syndrome , fatal cardiac anomaly ) . Any infant congenital condition would prevent specimen collection treatment application ( cleft lip/palate , choanal atresia , abdominal wall defect , imperforate anus , etc. ) . Sufficient length NICU admission necessary adequately measure primary outcome . Therefore , enrol patient include data analysis remain NICU least one subsequent MSSA/MRSA screening perform follow completion initial treatment course either mupirocin placebo .</criteria>
