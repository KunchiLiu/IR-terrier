	<brief_title>Neonatal Resuscitation - Sustained Inflations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Around 10 % newborns require form assistance delivery , baby bear prematurely likely require resuscitation Current UK guideline advise initial resuscitation delivery five 'inflation breath ' last 2-3 second peak inflation pressure 30cmH2O ( 20-25cm H2O premature neonate ) . Previous study show despite resuscitation training , clinician simulate real resuscitation scenario deliver recommend duration inflation breath . This , combine leak around facemask often large 50 % great , contributes low expire tidal volume resuscitation , thus increase likelihood hypoxia delay establish effective respiration . The use sustain inflation ( 15 second ) , rather intermittent short inflation breath , show promising result , reduction need intubation , need duration mechanical ventilation . Around 30 % unit Germany use sustain inflation first line delivery room management , many hospital around world . Resuscitation guideline USA , UK Europe suggest sustain inflation research . Several study show several length inflation breath , expire tidal volume achieve high baby make respiratory effort inflation ( active inflation ) stimulation spontaneous respiratory effort key part establish FRC , enable spontaneous breathing , increase likelihood successful resuscitation . To date , study directly compare whether prolonged inflation successful provoke inspiration method resuscitation . We therefore aim compare 15 second sustain inflation repeat short inflation determine effective .</detailed_description>
