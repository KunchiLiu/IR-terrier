	<brief_summary>Adipose-derived stromal vascular fraction cell ( SVFs ) include regenerative cell population ( hematopoietic cell , pericytes , endothelial cell progenitor , stromal/stem cell ) thus potentially important new therapeutic tool repair regeneration acute chronically damage tissue . The general objective study evaluate safety clinical efficacy single intra-articular injection freshly isolate auto-SVFs treatment patient knee osteoarthritis ( OA ) . This study use autologous adipose-derived SVFs , therapeutic agent intra-articular administration , mode delivery . Expected clinical effect : treatment reduces pain , increase function reduces stiffness knee osteoarthritic subject .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subcutaneous human adipose tissue abundant accessible cell source application tissue engineering regenerative medicine . Methods extract stromal/stem cell waste product abdominoplasty , cosmetic surgery , liposuction well develop . Routinely , adipose tissue digest collagenase relate enzymes release heterogeneous population SVF cell . The SVF cell use directly culture plastic ware select expand adherent population know adipose-derived stromal/stem cell . Osteoarthritis common joint disease affect least 20 % world population . The disease usually begin age 40 year . Radiographic sign osteoarthritis diagnose 50 % people age 55 year 80 % - 75 year . OA cause severe pain stiffness affect joint , thus reduce joint 's functionality . Therefore treatment would reduce pain/stiffness increase joint function would benefit many people . Safety feasibility SVFs OA patient show clinical study . This trial prospective , control , non-randomized , non-blinded , interventional study determine safety efficacy single injection freshly isolate autologous SVFs knee osteoarthritic patient ( Grade II-III ) . In experimental group participant ( n=20 ) undergo standard liposuction harvest adipose tissue , adipose tissue process obtain SVFs patient receive single intra-articular injection auto-SVFs affect knee ultrasound navigation . In parallel control group participant ( n=20 ) receive single intra-articular injection hyaluronic acid ( Synocrom Forte 2 % ) ultrasound navigation . The safety auto-SVFs injection evaluate assessment frequency nature adverse event occur immediately procedure , one year follow treatment . Patients monitor 1 , 3 , 6 12- month 's visit .</detailed_description>
