	<brief_title>Triadyme-C , Polycrystalline Diamond Compact Cervical Disc Replacement ( cTDR )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately fifty percent population evidence degenerative change cervical spine age fifty . As part age process , intervertebral disc wear . They lose flexibility elasticity begin collapse even herniate . This process may result pathological condition call cervical Degenerative Disc Diseases ( cDDD ) . cDDD either asymptomatic symptomatic , show different symptom neck , shoulder , head , arm leg pain , possibly associate numbness , tingle weakness upper extremity . In case symptomatic cDDD initially treat conservatively rest , immobilization , physical therapy , chiropractic manipulation pain medication . For case respond conservative therapy , anterior cervical discectomy fusion ( ACDF ) standard technique . The primary purpose ACDF excise disc material ( discectomy ) , compress spinal nerve cord cause pain , sensory disturbance weakness affect level , follow interbody fusion adjacent vertebra use graft intersomatic device compensate instability loss disc height result discectomy . Despite success common procedure , disadvantage mention include donor site morbidity autograft use , graft device subsidence pseudarthrosis segment fuse . Besides , physiological motion successfully fuse segment longer possible . This alter load kinematics adjacent spine segment believe author lead adjacent segment overload report several clinical biomechanical study . To address disadvantage ACDF , cervical total disc replacement ( cTDR ) develop 1990s , aim carry load restore normal disc height preserve almost physiological segmental motion . Today , several different cTRD design market , mid- long-term result . A number randomize controlled trial indicate clinical equivalence even superiority cTDR aspect compare ACDF . The Dymicron Triadyme-C cTDR two-piece articulate artificial disc prosthesis . Its patented tri-lobe articulation mechanism consist three spherical lobe mat three non-congruent , spherical pocket . The motion three lobe within associate pocket emulate control natural motion cervical spine motion segment degrees freedom.Triadyme-C self-centering device . This achieve implant grow height move away center . The away center , tight ligament stretch . Each half Triadyme-C sintered monobloc , consist polycrystalline diamond ( PCD ) bear surface base titanium-titanium carbide ( Ti-TiC ) composite . PCD sinter material compose fused diamond crystal ( typically 90 % ) small amount catalyst sinter metal . The polycrystalline structure diamond , together small amount residual metal alloy , contribute significantly extraordinary toughness abrasion-resistance material . PCD retain many phenomenal property natural diamond , include hardness , isotropic form far resistant fracture . This Post Market Clinical Follow-up ( PMCF ) conduct collect clinical radiographic outcome information patient suffer intractable symptomatic cervical disc disease require 1- 2-level reconstruction disc C3-C7 , treat Triadyme-C polycrystalline diamond compact cervical disc replacement .</detailed_description>
