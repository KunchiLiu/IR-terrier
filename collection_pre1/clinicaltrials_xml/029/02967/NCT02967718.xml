	<detailed_description>Coronary heart disease ( CHD ) major cause myocardial infarct ( MI ) death induce atherosclerosis coronary artery spasm . Despite improvement interventional pharmacological therapy acute MI , mortality early AMI remain high . Nowadays , life quality develop dietary structure change , morbidity hyperlipidemia dramatically increase . Based Chinese medicine , hyperlipidemia belongs phlegm 's basis atherosclerosis , blood-stasis pathological basis ischemia . Therefore , investigator proposes phlegm blood-stasis syndrome main differentiation CHD . Based , investigator prospectively retrospectively explore evolutionary process CHD phlegm-blood stasis syndrome large sample , multi-centre , cross-section observation combine longitudinal track on-site survey method.It provide evidence guidance future clinical treatment use Chinese medicine .</detailed_description>
