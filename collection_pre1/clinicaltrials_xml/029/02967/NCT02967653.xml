	<brief_summary>Lithium remain gold-standard treatment bipolar disorder , 30-40 % patient respond preferentially medication . Additionally , lithium commonly use treatment-resistant depression , psychiatric disorder ( e.g . schizoaffective disorder ) . Lithium especially valuable consider great difficulty achieve maintain symptomatic remission , high rate disability , well tremendous personal , family , societal cost associate bipolar disorder treatment-resistant depression . Despite , clinician increasingly avoid lithium , largely due fear irreversible chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) , particularly North America . It well known lithium exposure , even dose safely ( &lt; 1.0mmol/L adult 11 &lt; 0.8mmol/L geriatric patient 12,13 ) , increase risk CKD 3 time , large part Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus ( NDI ) 14-19 . NDI also associate acute kidney injury 20 , life-threatening hypernatremia , electrolyte imbalance characterize high level blood sodium . Aside hypertension , diabetes mellitus , age , nonspecific CKD risk factor . NDI characterize excessive thirst ( polydipsia ) due increase production dilute urine ( polyuria ) . In NDI , lithium believe interact inositol monophosphate protein kinase C pathway , thereby affect calcium-related intracellular signaling , cyclic AMP ( cAMP ) , inhibition Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3 Beta ( GSK3Beta ) , activation MAP Kinase many pathway . NDI occur commonly lithium user : 50 % chronic lithium user urinary concentrate difficulty , 12-19 % decreased urine osmolality ( UOsm ) &lt; 300mOsm/Kg ) . To date , amiloride ( 5-20mg/day ) medication prior evidence therapeutic effectiveness NDI randomize clinical trial . However potassium-sparing diuretic 31 , amiloride lead lithium-level elevation , thereby theoretically increase risk lithium-associated CNS acute renal toxicity . There need novel , well-tolerated agent treatment lithium-induced NDI . We recently demonstrate statin , well-tolerated commonly used medication , associate low lithium-induced NDI risk first previous cross-sectional study examine statin NDI human ( n=71 ) 33 . In study examine current lithium user age 20-95 , mean lithium duration serum lithium level 10.6 year 0.62mmol/L , respectively . Patients assess UOsm follow 10-hour water-restriction , reliable measure NDI . We find 0 % ( 0/17 ) statin user compare 20.4 % ( 11/54 ) non-users UOsm &lt; 300mOsm/Kg follow 10-hour water-restriction ( Fisher 's Exact p=0.055 ) . The main statin prescribe previous study atorvastatin 10-40mg/day ( n=10 ) 33 , widely use statin cardiovascular disease . Atorvastatin statins well-tolerated found adverse effect mood , cognition , renal function . The mechanism statins may treat NDI yet know , two independent mouse study demonstrate effectiveness statin treat genetic form NDI . In mice model genetic NDI , prostaglandin intracellular cytoskeleton protein pathway think explain statin ' activity NDI . In preparation project , co-investigators Drs . Trepiccione Christensen initiate pilot study mouse investigate whether atorvastatin treatment could improve lithium-induced NDI . NDI induce 10 mouse feed mice LiCl-enriched diet 15 day . After induction NDI , group mouse receive intraperitoneal injection atorvastatin ( n=5 ) control group receive vehicle ( n=5 ) additional 5 day parallel continue lithium treatment . Although small statistical sample allow u reach significance , ( n=5 per group ) , mice receive atorvastatin show tendency reduce polyuria . In line research , present research protocol aim conduct randomize controlled trial investigating statin , atorvastatin , treatment lithium-induced NDI .</brief_summary>
