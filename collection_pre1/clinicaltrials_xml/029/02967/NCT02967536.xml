	<brief_summary>Our multi-disciplinary research group work closely people obstructive sleep apnoea ( OSA ) . This life-long illness cause breathe stop sleep , lead low-oxygen blood . Breathing restart airway back throat reopens , usually arousal sleep . In people repeat arousal sleep cause daytime sleepiness . Our research show low blood oxygen level affect think feeling , case think damage brain cell involved memory , attention , emotion decision-making . This study investigate relationship amount oxygen blood loss ( ) brain cell . Also ability perform complex task affect patient suffer sleep apnoea . The result show whether brain damage patient sleep apnoea reverse treatment . These finding guide doctor treatment sleep apnoea cast light onto process memory decline aim preserve brain function .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Investigating Effect Continuous Positive Airway Pressure Neuropathology Obstructive Sleep Apnoea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , observational physiological study , anticipate last 4 year . It calculate minimum 14 patient untreated OSA study . In order study mechanism cognitive dysfunction OSA , participant start Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ( CPAP ) treatment follow confirm diagnosis sleep apnoea . CPAP treatment choice patient moderate severe OSA sleepy day . It also use patient mild OSA excessively sleepy suffer cardiovascular risk factor . It recommend National Institute Health Care Excellence ( NICE ) treatment adult moderate severe OSA ( Sleep apnoea - continuous positive airway pressure , NICE 2008 ) . In propose study initiation CPAP within 18 week period set National Health Service ( NHS ) Improvement Plan Standards Better Health ( Standards Better Health , Department Health 2004 ) . No patient diagnosis OSA commence treatment CPAP later advise NICE guideline clinical judgement best interest patient . In order investigate neuroinflammation process discrete change brain patient OSA , 7 patient mild 7 patient moderate severe OSA undergo 3 month CPAP treatment follow initial sleep ( assessment ) study . They undergo dynamic Positron Emission Tomography Magnetic Resonance ( PET-MR ) scan translocator protein ( TSPO ) tracer 11C- ( R ) -PK11195 time enrolment study 3 month treatment . Each participant also Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) scan 3 month treatment CPAP mask .</detailed_description>
