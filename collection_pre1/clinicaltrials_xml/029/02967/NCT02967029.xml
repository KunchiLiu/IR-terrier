	<detailed_description>For successful functional endoscopic sinus surgery ( FESS ) , crucial provide effective control hypotension reduce blood loss provide relatively blood-free surgical environment facilitate surgery . The goal control hypotension maintain arterial blood pressure sufficiently low allow reduction bleed offer superior intraoperative hemodynamic stability stressful surgical event maintain intact cerebral microcirculatory auto-regulation . Auto-regulation impairment control hypotension might increase oxygen extraction ratio . Thus monitor cerebral oxygen saturation ( rSO2 ) measure cerebral oxygenation become essential remains challenge clinically assess cerebral oxygenation routine basis . Various recent study report base facilitate induction control hypotension , effect hypotension cerebral perfusion oxygenation effect postoperative cognitive function still poorly characterize . Moreover , relationship rSO2 control hypotension establish patient undergo FESS . Within last decade , near infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) monitor clinically broadly spread technique , use non-invasive assessment cerebral perfusion detect change rSO2 online monitoring cerebral oxygenation . In clinical routine achieve control hypotension , esmolol remifentanyl commonly use hypotensive agent . The aim prospective randomize single blind study investigate influence remifentanyl hypotensive agent comparison esmolol rSO2 use NIRS postoperative cognitive function patient undergoing FESS . After receive local institutional research ethic committee approval write informed consent patient , 140 American Society Anesthesiology ( ASA ) I II patient age 18 65 , undergo elective FESS require control hypotension enrol study . Patients hypertension , coronary artery diseases cerebral insufficiency , severe hypovolemia anemia , body mass index 30 kg/m2 , anticoagulation therapy previous hypersensitivity study drug exclude study . They equally randomly assign receive either remifentanil esmolol maintain mean arterial blood pressure ( MAP ) 55-65 mmHg . After insertion peripheral venous cannula upon arrival operating room , balance electrolyte solution 5 ml/kg/h initiate . Following premedication intravenous midazolam 0.05 miligram/kg IV 15 min prior induction anesthesia , standard monitoring apply consist electrocardiography ( EKG ) , noninvasive blood pressure , peripheral oxygen saturation ( SPO2 ) . Further , cerebral oxygen saturation value ( rSO2 , use NIRS adult probe place median frontal region ) continuously monitor use NIRS induction anesthesia . After preoxygenation anaesthesia induce 2 miligram/kg propofol , 2 μg/kg fentanyl facilitate endotracheal intubation 0.6 miligram/kg rocuronium administer . Following orotracheal intubation , mechanical ventilation adjust maintain PaCO2 35 40 mm Hg . Anaesthesia maintenance perform use sevoflurane ( 0.8 1 adjust MAC ) mixture O2/Nitrous oxide 50 % /50 % . Then treatment protocol consist remifentanil esmolol deliver order induce control hypotension consider effective MAP reach target pressure 60 mmHg . Patients esmolol group ( Group E ) receive esmolol 0.5 miligram/kg iv induction follow continuous infusion esmolol 5-15 miligram/kg/min titrate maximum dose 300μg/kg/min reach target MAP 50-60 mmHg value 5 mmHg . Patients remifentanil group ( Group R ) receive remifentanil 0.5 μg/kg/min induction follow infusion remifentanil 0.1- 0.5 μg/kg/min titrate 0,1- 0,5 μg/kg/min reach target MAP 50-60 mmHg value 5 mmHg . In group surgical stress apply 5 min follow start hypotension . Cerebral desaturation define reduction rSO2 high 20 % baseline ≥ 15 second . When cerebral desaturation occur , remifentanil esmolol infusion dos decrease MAP increase intravascular fluid administration ephedrine . When hypotension target MAP bradycardia heart rate 45 beats/min long one minute duration occur , bolus ephedrine 10 mg iv atropine 0.1 miligram/kg iv apply , respectively . All operation perform attend surgeon order ensure consistency estimation surgical field blind hypotensive agent . When MAP reach desire range ( 50-60 mmHg ) maintain least 10 minute , quality surgical field define term blood loss dryness use 10 point scale ( 0= bleeding , virtually bloodless field ; 10= uncontrolled bleeding ) . The cognitive function patient assess use Mini Mental State Examination ( MMSE ) test . Preoperative MMSE test do premedication room 1 hour surgery 120 minute discontinuation drug patient . A decrease MMSE score ≥ 2 point baseline consider index decline cognitive function . Hemodynamics ( Diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) , Mean blood pressure ( MBP ) , systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) heart rate ( HR ) , SPO2 rSO2 record preoperatively ( baseline ) , postinduction 5th min ( administration hypotensive anesthetic agent ) , intraoperatively ( 10 , 20 , 30 , 45 , 60 , 90 minute ) , 5 10 minute stoppage hypotensive agent . Additionally , duration surgery , duration anesthesia , consumption dose hypotensive agent , desaturated desaturated patient among group also record .</detailed_description>
