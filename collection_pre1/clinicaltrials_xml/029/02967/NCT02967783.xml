	<detailed_description>Background information rationale Background information Polio eradication require removal poliovirus human population , whether wild-type poliovirus ( WPV ) vaccine-derived poliovirus ( VDPV ) emanate oral poliovirus vaccine ( OPV ) . The Polio Eradication &amp; Endgame Strategic Plan 2013-2018 provide framework interruption WPV transmission remain endemic focus lay plan new polio endgame . This include withdrawal Sabin strain , start type 2 strain , introduction inactivate poliovirus vaccine ( IPV ) , risk mitigation purpose . The introduction one dose IPV routine immunization schedule OPV-only use country plan completion 2016 . However , due recent development global IPV supply landscape , polio eradication program face critical shortage vaccine currently forecast continue least end 2017 . The shortage prevent universal introduction one dose IPV routine immunization schedule may also mean country already introduced vaccine , consider relatively low risk , leave without adequate supply . Exacerbating shortage demand reserve IPV future outbreak response ( OBR ) . The current OBR protocol recommend , event circulate vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 ( cVDPV2 ) outbreak switch , large scale IPV response implement - preventive campaign zone surround outbreak ( rather core area outbreak ) increase population immunity type 2 poliovirus area high risk drive transmission consider ongoing VDPV2 outbreak nearby . In light number individual vaccinate circumstance , dose-sparing administration intradermal ( ID ) fractional ( one fifth - 0.1mL ) dos IPV ( fIPV ) become important focus . The approach new , assessed trial undertaken vaccine-naive infant , OPV-primed infant child , well adult . In addition , give practical logistical challenge needle syringe ( N &amp; S ) -based ID vaccine administration , use needle-free administration device also explore previously . In trial , administration one fifth full dose ID route consistently demonstrate good safety profile . The rate local reaction related administration vaccine ID route compare intramuscular ( IM ) route high although trial . However , reaction report generally mild self-limiting irrespective method administration employ . No significant systemic reaction serious adverse event ( SAE ) relate ID fIPV administration report . Furthermore , although comparison undertaken , seroconversion rate neutralize antibody titre generate ID fIPV consistently low generate full IM dose vaccine , immunogenicity approach view viable alternative context current Global Polio Eradication Initiative ( GPEI ) strategy . Of particular importance , study undertake Cuba Bangladesh , administration single ID fIPV dose poliovirus-vaccine naive infant show effectively prime immune system subsequent rapid anamnestic response ID fIPV booster . In Cuba , prim ID fIPV four month age result response within seven day subsequent ID fIPV booster dose eight month - result cumulative seroconversion rate 98 % poliovirus serotype 2 two dose course . The equivalent figure 81 % follow six 14 week prime-boost schedule Bangladesh . In case , cumulative seroconversion rate follow two ID fIPV dose significantly high serotypes seroconversion rate record follow single full-dose IPV administer IM route ( 98 % versus 62 % Cuba ; 80 % versus 39 % Bangladesh serotype 2 ) . The demonstrated anamnestic response describe , provide effective strategy rapidly induce seroprotection prim population campaign-based provision second dose ID fIPV - initiated part OBR . In addition , coverage assure , use two dose ID fIPV routine schedule provide high level seroprotection single IM IPV dose still remain dose sparing ( 0.2mL versus 0.5mL ) . Based data available assessment current global landscape , late WHO position paper polio vaccine , publish March 2016 , suggest ' ... country could consider institute 2-dose fractional dose schedule , could ensure eligible infant receive IPV ... ' . The paper indicate 'One fractional-dose IPV may particularly appropriate outbreak response supply limit ' . Based recommendation , assessment , several state India subsequently decide introduce two ID fIPV dose routine immunization schedule . Rationale While safety immunogenicity ID fIPV establish clinic setting , little data examine feasibility rapid ID fIPV delivery community-based campaign . Many country across sub-Saharan Africa , part world OPV supplementary immunization activity ( SIA ) ongoing , establish highly effective framework campaign-based delivery oral vaccine orally administer intervention ( e.g . vitamin A medendazole ) . However , SIA commonly rely use non-clinically trained individual frontline delivery ( example , volunteer youth group community organization play key role campaign The Gambia ) . National campaign involve delivery IM vaccine ( e.g . MenAfriVac™ recently measles rubella combine vaccine [ 90-95 % coverage 802 425 target nine-month 15 year old The Gambia April 2016 ] ) also undertake successfully - case rely nurse public health officer ( health professional involve routine provision Expanded Programme Immunization ( EPI ) schedule ) administer vaccine . However , delivery IM injection part routine day-to-day practice professional complete almost 100 % success follow limited training . In contrast , reliable delivery ID injection , require ensure consistent immunogenicity fIPV , notoriously difficult N &amp; S , particularly active infant child , require train also significant practical experience . Indeed , data Cuba The Gambia highlight immunogenicity ID fIPV directly determine injection quality , assess ID bleb size fluid loss injection site ( [ 14 ] The Gambia - unpublished data ) . Furthermore , give nature injection , approach time consume IM vaccination ( The Gambia - Figure 1 [ unpublished data ] ) markedly time consume delivery dose OPV . This important manpower implication even assume personnel requisite skill available . Given challenge , pragmatic trial specifically compare feasibility ID fIPV delivery use three different method administration campaign set rural part The Gambia : - Needle syringe [ N &amp; S ] ( auto-disable , fixed needle ) - Intradermal Adapter [ IDA ] - West Pharmaceutical Services Inc - Tropis™ Disposable Syringe Jet Injector [ DSJI ] - Pharmajet Gaining understanding utility different method ID fIPV delivery campaign represent important final step key decision regard approach take fIPV delivery , particularly OBR , finalize . A number qualitative quantitative endpoint assess related practicality implementation . Information solicit local systemic reactogenicity also collect strengthen exist data set regard particularly relate campaign-based administration . Immunogenicity data also generate subset 24 59 month old vaccine recipients ensure factor enhance speed ease ID fIPV administration significantly compromise ID fIPV immunogenicity - example result poor injection quality . This age group choose limit potential confounding effect receive different number OPV and/or IPV dose present young age group . The data also expand currently limit data-set regard ID fIPV administration sub-Saharan Africa - setting risk future cVDPV2 outbreak inconsiderable despite recent sustained progress .</detailed_description>
