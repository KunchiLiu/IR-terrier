	<brief_summary>Rationale : Completely resect non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) patient histologically confirm N2 disease heterogeneous population , 5-year survival rate range 10 % 30 % . Systemic recurrence follow surgery one major problem stage IIIA ( N2 ) patient , use postoperative chemotherapy ( POCT ) stage IIIA disease prolongs survival . The value postoperative radiotherapy ( PORT ) completely resect NSCLC remain controversial , effect survival inconclusive . Recently , several large retrospective study review National Cancer Database indicate modern PORT appear confer additional 5 % survival advantage beyond achieve adjuvant chemotherapy alone . Actually , complete resection POCT , 20 % -40 % case risk locoregional recurrence ( LRR ) . Patients completely resect stage IIIA ( N2 ) disease might hold different postoperative patterns-of-failure prognosis . It yet know subset specific prognostic factor confer low LRR risk , whether give PORT effective radiation therapy treat patient completely resect pathologic stage IIIA ( N2 ) NSCLC . Purpose : This randomized phase II trial study clinical efficacy PORT administer use three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy ( 3D-CRT ) technique propose standard PORT clinical target volume ( CTV ) delineation guideline treat low risk LRR patient completely resect pathologic stage IIIA ( N2 ) NSCLC .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : 1 . Primary - Investigate value PORT completely resect pathologic stage IIIa ( N2 ) NSCLC compare disease-free survival patient low risk LRR treat PORT v PORT . 2 . Secondary - Determine overall survival patient treat regimen . - Compare locoregional recurrence-free survival patient treat regimen . - Compare distant metastasis-free survival patient treat regimen . - Determine pattern recurrence patient treat regimen . - Determine treatment-related adverse event regimens patient . - Determine prediction model locoregional recurrence brain metastasis base clinical , pathological , radiological , genetic , tumor microenvironmental immunological data . OUTLINE : This multicenter , randomize study . The clinical risk prediction model LRR establish base large institutional database . On multivariate analysis , heavy cigarette smoke history , cN2 status , number involve lymph node &gt; 4 independently significant factor predict high risk LRR . The PI equation build include three categorical variable coefficient base level significance : PI＝ ( 0.9×smoking history ) ＋ ( 0.5×clinical N status ) ＋ ( 0.8×number involve lymph node ) . Patients PI score &lt; 3.5 consider low risk LRR . Patients stratify accord participate center , EGFR mutation status ( EGFR 19del 21L858R mutation v others ) , use pretreatment positron emission tomography scan ( yes v ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . Arm I ( PORT ) : Participants Arm I receive four cycle adjuvant chemotherapy , sequential adjuvant thoracic conformal radiotherapy ( 50.4 Gy , 1.8 Gy daily 5.5 week ) administer . PORT begin within 2-6 week chemotherapy . Arm II ( PORT ) : Participants Arm II receive four cycle adjuvant chemotherapy undergo adjuvant thoracic conformal radiotherapy . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 300 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
