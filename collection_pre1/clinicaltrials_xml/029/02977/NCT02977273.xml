	<brief_summary>Meal size strongly influence number external feature food environment promote over-consumption , availability palatable energy dense food large portion size . The current research aim investigate whether natural food-based difference texture could use slow eat rate reduce intake large portion . A four-session randomise crossover study assess effect faster vs. slow eat rate , achieve manipulate food texture , ad-libitum consumption ( weight calorie ) meal , alone combination variation meal portion size ( regular vs. large )</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Lunch Study : Combined Effects Food Texture Portion Size Intake</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current obesogenic environment characterize abundance palatable high energy dense food . Eating large portion promote sustain overcompensation meal time . On hand , eat slow rate show reduce meal size , food-based texture difference slow eat rate . It possible texture-based difference eat rate could use reduce energy intake food serve large portion . This study conduct quantify effect eat rate ( fast vs. slow ) ad-libitum consumption meal , alone combination variation portion size ( 100 % 700 g vs 150 % 1050 g ) . The meal combination follow : Meal 1 : thin/100 % portion ; Meal 2 : thin/150 % portion ; Meal 3 : thick/100 % portion ; Meal 4 : thick /150 % portion Participants consume four test meal four non-consecutive test session Clinical Nutrition Research Centre , least three day washout session . Each part follow completely randomise full crossover design . The primary objective ass ad libitum intake ( kcal g ) test meal , depend combination food texture energy density . The secondary objective ass eat rate , oral processing characteristic , change rat appetite 90 minute post-consumption energy intake ( kcal ) rest test day ( food diary ) , function test meal texture energy density</detailed_description>
