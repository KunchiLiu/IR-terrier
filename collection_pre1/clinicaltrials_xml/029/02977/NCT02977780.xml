	<brief_summary>This research study study several investigational drug possible treatment Glioblastoma ( GBM ) . The drug involve study : - Abemaciclib - Temozolomide ( temodar ) - Neratinib - CC115</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>INdividualized Screening Trial Innovative Glioblastoma Therapy ( INSIGhT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study Phase II clinical trial . Phase II clinical trial test safety effectiveness investigational drug learn whether study drug work treat specific disease . `` Investigational '' mean drug study . In research study , investigator look compare effect , good bad , standard care three investigational agent sub-studies Abemaciclib , Neratinib , CC115 help people Glioblastoma include specific molecular change gene protein . The FDA approve Temozolomide ( temodar ) treatment disease , however FDA approve Abemaciclib , CC115 , Neratinib diseases .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must histologically confirm intracranial glioblastoma gliosarcoma follow maximum surgical resection . Tumors primarily localize infratentorial compartment exclude . Participants may prior surgery glioblastoma gliosarcoma systemic radiation therapy . Age ≥ 18 year . Karnofsky performance status ≥60 Participants must normal organ marrow function define : Leukocytes ≥3,000/mL Absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mL Platelets ≥100,000/mL Hemoglobin ≥ 9g/dl Total bilirubin within normal institutional limit ( except participant 's Gilbert 's disease ) AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 × institutional upper limit normal Creatinine ≤ institutional upper limit normal OR Creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 participant creatinine level institutional normal . Potassium within normal institutional range , correctable supplement Serum amylase ≤ 1.5 x institutional upper limit normal Serum lipase ≤ 1.5 x institutional upper limit normal INR &lt; 2.0 PTT ≤ institutional upper limit normal , unless receive therapeutic low molecular weight heparin Must able swallow pill . Participants must plan begin radiation therapy 1442 day surgical resection . Immunohistochemically negative IDH1 R132H mutation . Evidence tumor MGMT promoter unmethylated standard care assay . Genotyping data available process ( data must available time initial registration randomization probability differ across biomarker subgroup determine DFCI Coordinating Center ) assign biomarker subgroup whole exome sequencing , whole genome copy number analysis , combination describe Section 9.1 . MRI gadolinium obtain within 21 day prior begin treatment . Patients without measurable disease eligible . Participants must able undergo MRIs ( CTs allow response assessment study ) . The effect experimental agent use study develop human fetus unknown . For reason therapeutic agent use trial know teratogenic , woman childbearing potential ( woman free menses &gt; 2 year , post hysterectomy/oophorectomy , surgically sterilize ) men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation unless otherwise specify substudy participant randomize . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . For woman child bear potential ( woman free menses &gt; 2 year , post hysterectomy/oophorectomy , surgically sterilize ) negative serum pregnancy test must document prior initial registration . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Participants eligible original diagnosis lower grade glioma subsequent histologic diagnosis reveal glioblastoma . Planned major surgery . Participants receive investigational agent . Participants prior cranial radiotherapy . Planned use Optune™ . History different malignancy , unless ( ) diseasefree least 2 year deem investigator low risk recurrence malignancy , and/or ( b ) malignancy cervical cancer situ , superficial bladder cancer basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin , malignancy treat . Patients meet listed criterion preventative treatment deem eligible . History intratumoral peritumoral hemorrhage deem significant treating physician . Impaired cardiac function clinically significant cardiac disease , include follow : Active uncontrolled cardiac disease , include cardiomyopathy , congestive heart failure ( New York Heart Association functional classification ≥2 ) , unstable angina , myocardial infarction within 12 month enrollment , ventricular arrhythmia . Known history congenital QT prolongation Torsade de pointes ( TdP ) . Complete leave bundle branch bifascicular block . QTc interval &gt; 450 m men &gt; 470 ms woman . Persistent history clinically meaningful ventricular arrhythmia atrial fibrillation . Unstable pectoris myocardial infarction ≤ 3 month prior start study treatment . Uncontrolled hypertension ( blood pressure ≥ 160/95 mmHg ) . Other clinically significant heart disease congestive heart failure require treatment . Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus , subject either follow : Fasting blood glucose ( FBG define fast least 8 hour ) ≥ 200 mg/dL ( 7.0 mmol/L ) , HbA1c ≥ 8 % Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited ongoing active infection , chronic liver disease ( e.g. , cirrhosis , hepatitis ) , chronic renal disease , pancreatitis , chronic pulmonary disease , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Subjects must free clinically relevant disease ( glioma ) would , treat investigator 's opinion , interfere conduct study study evaluation . Known active Hepatitis B ( e.g. , HBsAg reactive ) Hepatitis C ( e.g. , HCV RNS [ qualitative ] detect ) . Known acute chronic pancreatitis . Participants active diarrhea ≥ CTCAE grade 2 despite medical management . Active infection require antibiotic . Pregnant breastfeeding . Impairment gastrointestinal ( GI ) function GI disease may significantly alter absorption study drug ( e.g. , ulcerative disease , uncontrolled nausea , vomit , diarrhea , malabsorption syndrome , extensive small bowel resection ) . Participants unresolved diarrhea ≥ CTCAE grade 2 exclude previously indicate . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition experimental agent agent use study . Participants take enzymeinducing antiepileptic drug ( EIAED ) : phenobarbital , phenytoin , fosphenytoin , primidone , carbamazepine , oxcarbazepine , eslicarbazepine , rufinamide , felbamate . Participant must EIAEDs least 7 day prior plan start study treatment . A list EIAED inducer CYP3A4 provide . Among nonEIAED , caution recommend use valproic acid due potential drug interaction . Participants take drug know strong inhibitor inducer isoenzyme CYP3A . Participant must CYP3A inhibitor inducer least 7 day prior plan start study treatment . NOTE : participant must avoid consumption Seville orange ( juice ) , grapefruit grapefruit juice , grapefruit hybrid , pummelo exotic citrus fruit 7 day prior plan start study treatment entire study treatment period due potential CYP3A4 interaction . Current use herbal preparations/medications , include limited : St. John 's wort , Kava , ephedra ( huang ) , gingko biloba , dehydroepiandrosterone ( DHEA ) , yohimbe , saw palmetto , ginseng . Participants stop use herbal medication 7 day prior plan start study treatment . Current use warfarin sodium coumadinderivative anticoagulant . Participant must Coumadinderivative anticoagulant least 7 day prior plan start study treatment . Low molecular weight heparin factor Xa inhibitor allow .</criteria>
