	<brief_summary>The success anti-CTLA4 therapy inaugurate paradigm shift oncology drug target immune system rather cancer cell order stimulate anti-tumor immune response . In situ immunization strategy immunomodulatory product pathogens inject one tumor site order trigger systemic anti-tumor immune response . Of importance , pre-clinical rationale demonstrate combination anti-CTLA4 therapy together intra-tumoral ( IT ) oncolytic virus overcome primary resistance systemic anti-CTLA4 therapy . Pexastimogene Devacirepvec ( Pexa-Vec ) one new vaccinia oncolytic virus genetically modify express GM-CSF . This new innovative oncolytic virotherapy therefore synergize anti-CTLA4 therapy via virus-induced tumor cell death &amp; tumor-antigen release , GM-CSF-induced recruitment/maturation/activation antigen present cell , anti-CTLA4-induced Treg blockade/depletion . Intra-tumoral delivery immunostimulating agent , therefore , provide low toxicity mAb target immune checkpoint . Of note , IT injections GM-CSF-encoding oncolytic virus already show induce immune-mediated tumor response local ( inject ) distant ( inject ) tumor site . In solid injectable refractory/relapsing metastatic tumor , make hypothesis addition Pexa-Vec IT ipilimumab ( anti-CTLA4 Ab ) overcome primary/secondary resistance standard therapy and/or immunotherapy well situ tumor antigen specific T-cell priming . Our proposal conduct 2-part Phase I clinical trial order define feasibility , safety anti-tumor effect intra-tumoral injection ipilimumab combination oncolytic virus Pexa-Vec . Dose escalation step define MTD RP2D situ immunization strategy . Expansion part ass anti-tumor effect combination .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study proof concept , open label , multicentric , 2-parts , Phase I dose escalation trial . In dose selection part ( histological type except HCC ) , patient treat IT boost injection Pexa-Vec ( fix dose 1x109 pfu / injection ) alone Week 1 follow IT injections Pexa-Vec + ipilimumab ( 4 dose level ) Weeks 3 , 5 9 . The dose escalation part follow classical 3+3 design . 3 6 patient enrol DL ( Dose Level ) depend number Dose Limiting Toxicity ( DLT ) observe . At end DL cohort , teleconference ( Dose escalation meeting ) organize sponsor , order select dose next cohort . In Expansion cohort ( 3 cohort ) patient treat IT boost injection Pexa-Vec alone ( fix dose 1x109 pfu / injection ) Week 1 follow IT injections Pexa-Vec + ipilimumab ( RP2D ) Weeks 3 , 5 9 . In part , treatment IMPs continue per protocol Withdrawal consent , Disease progression per irRC ( immune relate response criterion ) , General specific change patient 's condition render patient unacceptable treatment judgment investigator , Pregnancy Unacceptable adverse event ( ) include DLTs .</detailed_description>
