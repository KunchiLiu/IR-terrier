	<brief_summary>Conventional indirect indicator iron status , use serum red blood cell biomarkers , confound inflammation common infection sub-Saharan Africa , region high prevalence iron deficiency , make assessment iron balance efficiency iron intervention difficult . A new method allow accurate measurement long-term oral iron absorption allow estimation iron requirement highly need . Such novel method quantify iron absorption requirement use isotope dilution measurement child validate present prospective observational study following-up group 49 child give stable iron isotope earlier trial . We request seven blood sample within 2 year ( sample every four month ) participant allow u measure isotopic dilution estimate total oral iron absorption 24 month .</brief_summary>
