	<brief_summary>During exercise , energy come mainly carbohydrates lipid . The relative contribution lipid glucose energy substrate exercise depend parameter exercise ( duration , intensity level training ) physiological condition subject . Inflammatory diseases juvenile idiopathic arthritis ( JIA ) treat , severe form , biotherapies . These treatment target certain pro-inflammatory cytokine include TNFα . In adult rheumatoid arthritis several study show treatment anti-TNFα increase insulin sensitivity . There data oxidation energy substrate exercise child adolescent AJI , impact anti-TNFα treatment oxidation energetic substrate child . Investigators hypothesize , compare healthy child , child JIA exhibit alter oxidation energy substrate rest submaximal physical exercise due physical deconditioning inflammation . In addition , treat anti-TNFα oxidation profile energy substrate exercise different patient treat anti-TNFα . Investigators also hypothesize anti-TNFα treatment modify contribution energy chain ( aerobic , anaerobic anaerobic alactic ) exercise .</brief_summary>
