	<brief_summary>Myeloma patient renal impairment need rapid effective reduction tumor burden enable renal recovery , correlate prognosis patient . However , effective combination regimen often hamper necessary dose reduction increase toxicity renally impaired patient . The well know positive effect renal impairment Bortezomib combine Daratumumab , , monoclonal Antibody , renally excrete metabolize far know add significant toxicity efficacy , make propose combination Daratumumab , Bortezomib Dexamethasone highly attractive renally impaired MM patient . In current clinical trial Daratumumab patient renal function impairment ( GFR ≤ 20 ml/min ) far exclude . Consequently question efficacy , safety pharmacokinetics Daratumumab combination Bortezomib Dexamethasone patient relapse refractory MM severe renal impairment still unanswered . This trial answer question patient group , still unmet need novel effective treatment option</brief_summary>
