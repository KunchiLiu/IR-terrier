	<brief_summary>Children burn injury experience severe pain intensity medical procedure despite increase dos analgesic . Current guideline pediatric procedural pain management recommend combination non-pharmacological pharmacological intervention enhance pain management decrease numerous side effect analgesic . Virtual reality ( VR ) gain grow consideration non-pharmacological method engage multiple sens allow interaction virtual world . Oculus Rift ® ( OR ) new technology VR provide immersiveness , relatively low cost , could probably improve management pain anxiety burn care . It also potential , appropriate custom software design burn pediatric patient , reduce cybersickness symptom ( nausea , dizziness ) associate VR . Overall hypothesis : Distraction VR via OR , combination standard pharmacological treatment , feasible , acceptable satisfactory method management pain anxiety burn-related treatment child burn injury . Note pilot study precede large trial aim assess effect virtual reality distraction via Oculus Rift ® ( DREAM-T : NCT02947243 )</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Decreasing REcurrent Pain Anxiety Medical Procedures With Pediatric Population : Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Burn injury lead cause morbidity mortality child . They associate lot pain difficult treat impede recovery , cause high level anxiety alter future pain behavior , result , time , chronic pain , paresthesia , depression . Pain also decrease participation treatment physiotherapy result poor health outcome . Beyond immediate pain experience , child may also develop pain memory circuit . Procedural pain still largely manage pharmacologically mostly use opioids , benzodiazepine , pharmacological agent cause lot side effect always provide sufficient pain reduction . In recent year , effectiveness multimodal approach combine medication non-pharmacological intervention procedural pain relief highlighte . Distraction technique engage multiple sens may grab child ` attention technique engage one sense ( e.g , music ) , hence , increase interest immersive interactive method distraction Virtual Reality ( VR ) . VR active distraction method allow user interact immersive environment generate computer stimulate different sens . A review study VR , mostly conduct adult burn patient , show 35 50 % reduction procedural pain use VR . However , despite promising result , use VR healthcare setting limit , mainly due high cost . Reviews highlight need research mostly development portable , less expensive developed VR system would promote pain reduction burn procedure especially child burn injury consider one challenge burn population . However , breakthrough technology since 2014 big scale company start invest VR development commercial gaming . Facebook purchase Oculus Rift ( OR ) mass production allow access late technology VR relatively low cost . OR VR tool provide wide field view ( FOV ) , high-resolution display , integrate 3D audio motion detection . In addition , ` highly immersive property could help achieve analgesia compare VR technique review show sense presence influence effectiveness VR-based analgesia . The sense presence subjective psychological state consciousness virtual world whereas immersiveness refers physical environment could quantify measure field view peripheral vision VR goggles . The availability inexpensive yet highly immersive VR goggles OR could increase use VR pain management burn setting significantly improve cost-effectiveness . A single case study assess feasibility VR intervention via OR one child 11 year old burn injuries occupational therapy . The study show reduction pain intensity pain unpleasantness experienced patient , without side effect . To knowledge , study test feasibility OR procedural pain management child burn injury undergo painful physiotherapy treatment . AIM : The aim pilot clinical trial ass acceptability feasibility VR distraction use OR child burn injury undergo burn-related treatment ( physiotherapy dress change ) . We also plan evaluate feasibility design predict appropriate sample size larger-scale clinical trial . METHODS : Design : Within-subject/crossover study design . Each child serve control receive standard experimental treatment treatment session randomize order . Sample Setting : Convenience sample surgical-trauma burn unit CHU Ste-Justine , child admit burn injury . Interventions . A ) Standard pharmacological treatment per unit 's protocol . B ) VR distraction use OR.The video game develop team personalize care content tailor child 's developmental stage maximize feeling immersion minimize cybersickness , approve team healthcare professional pediatric burn care . Study proceeding : Physiotherapy session dress change typically last 20 30 minute . The duration divide two sequence duration ( 10 15 minute ) participant receives care healthcare professional . For one sequence , standard treatment administer sequence , patient receive standard treatment addition VR via OR randomize order . Measures : Pain anxiety measure take treatment session ( T1 ) , first sequence session ( T2 ) second sequence session ( T3 ) follow measure nurse ` satisfaction level via questionnaire develop pretested team . We collect data average dos analgesic administer session , side effect experience addition design 's feasibility outcome : participant recruit month , adherence study protocol . Data analysis : Quantitative analysis . Mean difference pain score sequence compare use Wilcoxon test .</detailed_description>
