	<detailed_description>Introduction The face anatomically complex structure , consist skin , muscle fine gross motor function , complex bony structure , vital sensory organ . These structure allow one eat , breathe , see , hear , speak . Injuries face cause traumatic event motor vehicle collision , assault , fall result facial trauma , result swell disfiguration impairs important function face , sometimes life threatening degree . These injures resultant swell also precipitate psychological social consequences.1-3 Lymphedema abnormal amount fluid cause swell , usually arm leg . Though lymphedema occur result trauma , commonly associate side effect certain cancer-related treatment radiation therapy lymph node removal . The common presentation lymphedema upper extremity due breast cancer treatment.4 As , standard care management lymphedema primarily derive cancer research literature involve extremities.5 The current gold standard treatment patient extremity lymphedema complete decongestive therapy ( CDT ) .6 CDT multimodal therapy consist four component : manual lymph drainage , compression wrapping , exercise , skin care.6 Manual lymph drainage ( MLD ) delicate form massage design improve tissue cellular health facilitate fluid removal edematous area . Compression wrap utilizes compression garment short stretch compression bandage primarily use acute ( intensive ) phase CDT mean reinstate sufficient resistance skin tissue whose elastic fiber damage lymphedema . Exercise , especially combine compression , improve removal fluid affect area . Finally , skin care treatment keep skin clean moisturize reduce infection occur lymphedema.6 These therapeutic technique CDT employ Our Lady Lake Regional Medical Center ( OLOLRMC ) adapt treat facial edema patient facial trauma anecdotally good result term cosmesis . To best knowledge , clinical study examine effect lymphedema treatment management blunt facial trauma currently exist . Beyond consideration cosmesis , also seek determine intervention improve clinical outcome time swallow reduced time utilizing mechanical ventilation . This study prospectively evaluate use complete decongestive therapy test hypothesis intervention result improve clinical outcome patient blunt facial trauma . Specific Aims Specific Aim I : To determine whether complete decongestive therapy significantly reduce facial lymphedema measure previously establish facial composite scoring protocol . Specific Aim II : To determine whether complete decongestive therapy improve clinical outcome patient facial trauma Study Objective Endpoints Study Objective The primary objective study determine effect ( ) , , complete decongestive therapy management facial trauma . Primary Endpoint The primary endpoint composite facial score measure day discharge Trauma Neuro Critical Care ( TNCC ) intensive care unit ( ICU ) OLOLRMC . This measurement base Head &amp; Neck Lymphedema ( HNL ) program MD Anderson Cancer Center ( MDACC ) whose standard evaluation protocol include specific point-to-point measurement face ( Smith &amp; Lewin 2010 ; Smith Lewin 2014 ) . A series key facial measurement total provide `` composite facial score '' . Based clinical experience MDACC 150 patient , HNL program develop criterion define clinically detectable improvement external HNL . Those criterion drop lymphedema stage minimum threshold 2 % reduction composite measurement equate least 2-cm change absolute value ( Smith &amp; Lewin 2014 ) . Secondary endpoint Because facial neck composite score provide evaluation extent edema , also seek ass patient outcome regard follow : 1 . Stage lymphedema define MDACC HNL edema rating scale 2 . Number mechanical ventilation day 3 . Narcotic pain medicine utilization 4 . Steroid utilization 5 . Pain scale score determine Visual Analog Scale adult non-verbal pain score 6 . Time swallow 7 . ICU length stay ( ICULOS ) 8 . Hospital length stay ( LOS )</detailed_description>
