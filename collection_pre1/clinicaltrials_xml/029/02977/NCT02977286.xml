	<brief_title>Naloxegol Prevent Lower Gastrointestinal Paralysis Critically Ill Adults Administered Opioids</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Among 5 million adult admit ICU year USA , pain thus receive pain ( analgesic ) medication call opioid . Opioid use critically ill adult continue increase give great awareness untreated pain ICU opioid-first approach use optimize patient safety comfort improve tolerance breathe machine ( i.e . mechanical ventilation ) . Similar constipation , paralysis lower gastrointestinal ( GI ) tract define inability pas stool due impair gut movement , common effect opioid use critically ill. Lower GI tract paralysis may lead nausea , vomit , aspiration , compromise ability administer tube feed ( enteral nutrition ) , increase abdominal pain , delirium delay get mechanical ventilation . One recent randomize study find aggressive use laxatives prevent low GI tract paralysis critically ill adult associate low daily organ dysfunction [ measure Sequential Organ Failure Assessment ( SOFA ) score ] . The low GI tract paralysis occur critically ill often respond poorly laxative medication therapy ( e.g. , senna , bisacodyl , lactulose ) . While stool softener medication like docusate routinely administer patient opioids , laxative-based protocol frequently initiate ICU sign low GI tract paralysis start appear . There therefore important unmet need safe efficacious medication prevent low GI tract paralysis critically ill adult initiate opioid therapy . Naloxegol ( Movantik ) naloxone-like drug block effect opioids opioid µ receptor gut absorb brain ( therefore block pain effect opioids ) . Naloxegol currently approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment opioid-induced constipation ( OIC ) non-ICU patient receive schedule moderate high dose opioids treatment chronic non-cancer pain . Naloxegol mechanism action , efficacy , convenience administration , safety profile make ideal candidate use preventative medication lower GI tract paralysis critically ill adult receive schedule opioid therapy . The investigator propose pilot study test hypothesis naloxegol ( versus placebo ) reduce time first spontaneous bowel movement ( SBM ) ICU patient , prevent low GI tract paralysis critically ill adult initiate scheduled IV opioid therapy , use result side effect concern doctor patient . The investigator randomize 36 critically ill ICU patient ( 18 arm ) receive naloxegol [ 25mg 12.5mg ( patient creatinine clearance ≤ 60ml/min ) ] placebo . This pilot study provide valuable information help guide future , large study evaluate role naloxegol critically ill adult .</detailed_description>
