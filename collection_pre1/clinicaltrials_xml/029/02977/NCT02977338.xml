	<brief_title>Evaluation Patients With Obstructive Sleep Apnea That Had Undergone Diagnosis Surgical Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Drug induce sleep endoscopy ( DISE ) increasingly perform procedure , offer dynamic upper airway evaluation artificial sleep surgical treatment patient obstruct sleep apnea ( OSA ) . Aim : To evaluate value DISE tailor proper treatment patient snore OSA . DISE safe procedure , easily practicable , valid reliable . It consider fundamental clinical procedure essential choose surgical treatment . Results far suggest multilevel collapse significantly associate high apnea hypopnea index value . The investigator think weight play significant role RDI reduction . Results till show tailor surgery base DISE may leverage sleep surgery outcome significantly , present 70 % success rate base investigator 's experience The aim tudy evaluate surgery result patient underwent DISE prior surgery comparison condition prior treatment . The result DISE base treatment compare literature data patient underwent surgery without DISE . Method : A retrospective follow-up study . Patients snore OSA , sleep study DISE decide surgical treatment . DISE finding report use NOHL VOTE classification system ; site , degree airway narrow configuration obstruction . Patients underwent tailor surgery base DISE finding include multi-level surgery ; palate , tonsil , base tongue epiglottis . After examine result surgery patient , comparison make base sleep laboratory parameter ( RDI , minimum saturation , degree sleep apnea , degree snore ) data literature patient undergo DISE . On whole , degree improvement patient 's condition assess . We would like show preference surgery outcome patient diagnose use DISE .</detailed_description>
