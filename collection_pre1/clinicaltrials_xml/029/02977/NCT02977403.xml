	<brief_summary>Background : People constantly expose unhealthy food . Some study adults show train attention away unhealthy food might reduce overeat . Researchers want see happen brain teen train attention away food program smartphone . Objective : To study relationship eat pattern , body weight , brain reacts different image . Eligibility : Right-handed female age 12 17 overweight ( Body Mass Index 85th percentile age ) . Design : Participants 6 visit 8 month . Visit 1 : participant screen : Height , weight , blood pressure , waist size measurement Medical history Physical exam Urine sample DXA scan . Participants lie table small dose x-rays pass body . Questions general health , social psychological functioning , eat habit Parents guardian minor participant answer question child function demographic data . Before visit 2 6 , participant eat drink 12 hour . These visit include procedure : Blood drawn MRI scan . Participants lie stretcher slides metal cylinder strong magnetic field . A device place head . Meals provide . Participants fill rating form . Simple think task A cone contain magnetic field detector place onto head Medical history Physical exam Urine sample Participants assign 2-week smartphone program involve look picture . Participants complete short task answer question eat habit mood smartphone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mobile Attention Retraining Overweight Female Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over 30 % adolescent overweight 20 % obese , mechanisms produce excessive weight gain youth remain incompletely elucidate . Some overweight youth appear attention bias ( AB : tendency attend selectively stimuli acquire salience meaning ) toward highly palatable food may lead overeat . AB involve distinct cognitive process , ( 1 ) unconscious reaction ( UCR ) , reflect initial attention capture evoke salient stimulus , ( 2 ) continue attention deployment ( AD ) stimuli relevant current goal . These rapidly evolve process associate unique neurocircuitry best measure use high spatial resolution temporal sensitivity . Magnetoencephalography ( MEG ) novel neuroimaging technology excellent temporal good spatial resolution , thus uniquely ideally suit study neurocognitive mechanism AB . Reducing AB palatable food may help overweight youth curb consumption energy-dense option . Attention retrain ( AR ) program use reduce AB effective reduce AB unhealthy food adult . Although AR study involve computer laboratory , use smartphones natural environment may particularly effective method deliver AR adolescent measure AB use ecological momentary assessment . The first aim propose study examine impact 2-week smartphone AR program AB overweight adolescent ( 12-17 y/o ) girl without loss control ( LOC ) eating , define subjective experience lack control much one eating . LOC distinct eat behavior phenotype youth risk factor excess weight gain disorder eating , much prevalent among girl ( vs. boy ) . Overweight youth report LOC may particularly susceptible AB . Additionally , adult LOC demonstrate AB toward socially threaten cue , angry disapproving face , AB social threat may relevant relationship AB food overweight . The second aim examine , use MEG , effect 2-week smartphone AR program neural response food cue . The third aim examine effect AR program food intake body composition . An exploratory aim examine whether AB socially threaten cue , moderate effect novel intervention AB food cue , food intake , body composition . The propose study innovative study date examine impact AR deliver natural environment AB associate neurocircuitry use MEG group youth prone AB . These study may help characterize phenomenology distinct obesity subtypes may potentially identify approach could prevent undue weight gain adolescent girl risk obesity .</detailed_description>

Nonserious medical illness , seasonal allergy , review casebycase basis . 3 . Regular use medication know affect body weight eat behavior ( e.g. , stimulant prescribe attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , ADHD ) . Medication use nonserious condition ( e.g. , acne ) consider casebycase basis . 4 . Current pregnancy history pregnancy . 5 . A significant reduction weight past three month , reason , exceed 5 % body weight . 6 . Presence significant , fullthreshold psychiatric disorder base DSM criterion ( 102 ) , schizophrenia , bipolar disorder , alcohol substance abuse , anorexia bulimia nervosa , disorder , opinion investigator , would impede competence compliance possibly hinder completion study . These individual permit enroll current study refer treatment . Individuals present psychiatric disorder , include subthreshold psychiatric disorder , permit enroll study . If , base opinion investigator , participant require treatment his/her psychiatric symptom , individual refer treatment . Participants develop psychiatric disorder significant psychiatric symptom followup assessment study exclude provide treatment referral . 7 . Current regular substance use , include use alcohol and/or tobacco product ( include ecigarettes ) . 8 . A history significant recent brain injury may considerably influence performance ( i.e. , history loss consciousness great equal 30 minute associate head injury , history memory loss hospitalization associate head injury , great equal 2 concussion within last year ) . 9 . Current involvement weight loss program , participate psychotherapy aim weight loss treatment eat behavior ( e.g. , binge eat ) . 10 . All parents/guardians ask indicate child food allergy . To conservative , child report allergy gluten , nut , dairy , fruit , item array , exclude test meal portion study . 11 . A condition MEG contradict ( e.g. , metal body , pregnancy , claustrophobia , history significant neurological insult injury ) . 12 .
