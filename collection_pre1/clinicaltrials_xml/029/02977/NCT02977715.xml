	<detailed_description>Orthopoxvirus infection produce antibody response cross-protective virus within genus . It property orthopoxviruses allow vaccine vaccinia virus smallpox use provide protection monkeypox . Studies perform immediate aftermath smallpox eradication demonstrate smallpox vaccination ( first generation vaccine ) could confer protection infection monkeypox virus . Newer , third generation vaccine IMVAMUNE® , attenuate ( replication deficient ) strain vaccinia virus may offer alternative safer source vaccine-derived protection . The clinical presentation monkeypox infection similar smallpox , although less transmissible human-to-human smallpox less deadly ( case fatality estimate monkeypox approximately 10 % ) . Naturally-occurring human monkeypox largely restricted remote region Congo Basin forest Central Africa . This study first rigorous evaluation IMVAMUNE® region natural Orthopoxvirus transmission occur appreciable predictable rate . Healthcare frontline worker DRC currently high risk acquire monkeypox virus infection prevents perform work duty , compromise healthcare delivery already fragile system , result death . This open-label prospective cohort study 1,000 healthcare personnel risk monkeypox infection daily work document monkeypox virus exposure infection vaccinate participant concurrently evaluate immunogenicity safety IMVAMUNE vaccine . Study participation voluntary open male female healthcare personnel age 18 year old Tshuapa Province DRC . Participants receive two subcutaneous dos IMVAMUNE vaccine day 0 28 . Blood sample obtain day 0 , 14 , 28 , 42 , 180 , 365 , 545 , 730 immunogenicity analysis . After vaccination participant observe least thirty minute . They maintain adverse event diary record systemic local adverse event 7 day immunization . They also record exposure monkeypox virus exposure diary review follow-up visit . The study evaluate proportion participant vaccinate 1 ) develop suspect confirmed monkeypox infection , 2 ) experience exposure monkeypox virus . The study also evaluate safety immunogenicity IMVAMUNE .</detailed_description>
