	<brief_summary>For advanced solid tumor , current therapy inadequate improving quality life , slow progression disease , prolong survival , provide cure . Hence , continuous need innovative , safer effective anti-cancer therapy . Our study base dependence receptor paradigm associate therapeutic strategy . In preclinical model , prevent Netrin-1 interaction receptor sufficient trigger Netrin-1-expressing tumor cell death vitro well tumor growth metastasis inhibition vivo . This indicate therapeutic approach base Netrin-1/Netrin-1 receptor interaction inhibition feasible promising . NP137 `` first-in-class '' humanize monoclonal antibody target Netrin-1 ligand , secrete protein recently describe driver tumor initiation progression . NP137 demonstrate anti-tumor activity single agent several pre-clinical model cancer , include breast lung cancer . Taken together , several study strongly support rational preclinical development clinical evaluation highly potent selective anti-Netrin-1 antibody cancer patient . The propose study open label , multicenter , Phase I dose escalation study ass safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetic ( PK ) , pharmacodynamic ( PD ) preliminary anti-tumor activity NP137 administer every 2 week ( Q2W ) single agent patient locally advance metastatic solid tumor . This trial First Human ( FIH ) study NP137 ; clinical experience antibody clinic . Dose escalation part define Maximum tolerate dose Recommended Phase II dose ( MTD /RP2D ) NP137 Expansion part ass PD anti-tumor activity NP137 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The dose escalation part ( NP137 administer single agent intravenous injection 7 ascend dose level ) initiate accelerate dose titration 1 patient per DL occurrence ≥ Grade 2 drug-related AE . Following occurrence moderate toxicity , patient enrol slow dose escalation design least 3 patient per DL use Modified Continual Reassessment Method . Of note , case toxicity occur DL4 , classical 3+3 design initiate . In part , NP137 continue administer long patient experience clinical benefit opinion investigator unacceptable toxicity symptomatic deterioration attribute disease progression determine investigator integrate assessment radiographic data clinical status withdrawal consent patient willingness stop treatment . In expansion part , patient treat RP2D define Part 1 .</detailed_description>
