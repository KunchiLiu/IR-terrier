	<brief_summary>Assess response MK-3475 primary tumor , normal breast stroma , circulate lymphocyte serum exosomes treatment naive triple negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) patient . Assess change tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte ( TILS ) stromal ( sTILS ) intraepithelial ( iTILS ) newly diagnose early stage TNBC patient treat two dos MK-3475 prior lumpectomy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects MK-3475 ( Pembrolizumab ) Breast Tumor Microenvironment Triple Negative Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , single-arm , single institution pre-operative `` window opportunity study '' pembrolizumab subject newly diagnose triple-negative , &lt; 3 cm , node negative breast cancer . Subjects may receive prior neo/adjuvant chemotherapy , definitive surgery radiation treatment prior enrollment . The goal project determine immune modulation treatment MK-3475 ( Pembrolizumab ) triple negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) patient alter expression immune tolerant marker [ include PD-L1 ] , within primary tumor . Investigators hope determine MK-3475 exposure change molecular signature breast stroma `` normal '' adjacent breast tissue ( non-tumor tissue ) obtain prospectively time breast conserving surgery ( BCS ) TNBC patient . Finally , investigator investigate MK-3475 alters breast stromal response high dose radiation deliver intraoperative radiation therapy ( IORT ) .</detailed_description>
