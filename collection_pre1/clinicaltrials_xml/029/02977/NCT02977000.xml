	<detailed_description>Retinopathy prematurity ( ROP ) major cause blindness visual impairment child develop developed country around world . ROP multifactorial disease characterize perturbation normal vascular development retina . The pathogenesis ROP hypothesize consist two distinct phase second phase characterize hypoxia-induced up-regulation vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) retinal neovascularization . Recent study show relationship β-adrenergic system angiogenesis . This relationship observe several disease , like infantile hemangioma , ROP , neoplasias . Studies animal model show norepinephrine stimulates VEGF expression secretion retinal cell . In oxygen induce retinopathy , blockage β-adrenergic receptor ( β-AR ) inhibit angiogenic cascade interfere proliferation retinal vasculature . Also , angiogenesis seem impaired β-Argene deficient mouse , expose hypoxia stimulus , function restore gene therapy . An association ROP infantile hemangioma observe 50 year ago high prevalence ROP child hemangioma . Studies also show β-AR blockage reduces VEGF level favor regression infantile hemangioma . The treatment choice threshold stage ROP laser photocoagulation and/or intravitreal bevacizumab injection , management early stage ROP , expectant , ophthalmologic follow-up therapeutic intervention prevent progression . Propranolol non-selective β-AR blocker , equal affinity β1 β2 receptor . It systemic effect , act different tissue . In vivo model proliferative retinopathy show strong inhibitory role β-AR vascular change . In particular , β2-AR seem involved response . Propranolol show highly effective inhibit increase VEGF expression cause hypoxic insult , consequent neovascular Response . Studies show propranolol reduces overproduction VEGF oxygen induce retinopathy , VEGF level remain unchanged normal retina . Assuming human preterm newborn ROP VEGF overexpression retinal neovascularization response hypoxia might involve b-AR activation , design prospective randomize study assess effect oral propranolol progression early stage ROP low birth weight infant . Methods : A randomized control trial perform preterm newborn GA &lt; 32 week age Stage 2 ROP without plus zone II , Although infant receive supplemental oxygen , target range oxygen saturation maintain 91 % 95 % . The treated control newborns randomize 1:1 allocation block 8 use computer random number generator stratify center 2 group GA 24-28 28-32 week ; Exclusion criterion include newborns congenital acquire cardiovascular anomaly , renal failure cerebral hemorrhage enrollment , newborns ROP zone I advance stage Stage 2 without plus zone II . With severe adverse effect relate propranolol ( severe bradycardia , hypotension , wheeze ) , administration propranolol permanently discontinue . If episode observe within first 2 day treatment , newborn include control group . All newborn withGA &lt; 32 week ophthalmologic evaluation indirect ophthalmoscopy . When ROP zone II reach Stage 2 without plus , newborn enrol , ophthalmologic examination schedule weekly frequently , accord severity ROP . Propranolol administer orally dose 1.5 mg/kg.d divide q8h . investigator use powdered drug , dissolve 5 % dextrose . The treatment continue complete development retinal vascularization , although administration permit 90 day . Statistical analysis perform Statistical Software SPSS 17.0. investigator use test ass possible difference demographic , biochemical , hemodynamic , respiratory variable treat control newborn . The null hypothesis accept P &gt; .05 . The efficacy treatment evaluate mean risk ratio , ratio proportion subject progress advanced-stage ROP propranolol group vs control group . The relative reduction risk , reduction percent event treat group v control group event rate , calculate possible calculate risk ratio .</detailed_description>
