	<brief_title>The Impact Almond Nut Consumption Markers CVD &amp; Metabolic Health</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tree nut recommend prevention management cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) largely base LDL ( low density lipoprotein ) lowering effect , CVD risk reduction observe tree nut consumption great predict hypocholesterolemic effect alone . Other health benefit also note group , moderation postprandial lipemia , well others modify postprandial glycemia , decrease blood pressure ( BP ) , improvement oxidant status weight loss . Robust evidence protective cardio-metabolic effect nut PREDIMED study highlight association nut consumption decrease risk cardiovascular event , obesity , metabolic syndrome type 2 diabetes ( T2DM ) . However , paucity evidence effect almonds vascular function human ( BP endothelium-dependent vasodilation ( EDV ) ) , although evidence almond promote nitric oxide ( NO ) release animal consume high-fat diet . Fundamental vascular health well-functioning liver increase evidence demonstrate accumulation liver fat causative factor development cardio-metabolic disorder . Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) consider hepatic manifestation metabolic syndrome ( MetS ) ; recent data show link increased CVD risk via direct effect vascular function ( EDV ) independently obesity MetS . NAFLD think affect 30 % population develop country , two-thirds people obesity 50 % people hyperlipidemia . Development fatty liver , mainly attributable obesity elevate postprandial lipemia , associate increased inflammation , oxidative stress , insulin resistance , dyslipidemia impair EDV , predict risk CVD T2DM . Therefore , long-term goal research understand mechanism underpinning dietary change drive favourable modification CVD disease risk identify pattern population food choice , specifically almond consumption , tend correlate reduce CVD disease risk . The primary aim proposal investigate , randomise control , parallel arm , 6-wk dietary intervention ( n=100 ) whether replace snack base refine carbohydrate poor micronutrients/non-nutrient bioactives ( NNB ) nutrient/NNB-dense , whole almond snack influence liver fat content ( key metabolic driver insulin resistance vascular dysfunction , hallmark metabolic syndrome ) EDV ( brachial FMD independent predictor CVD event , addition related biomarkers cardio-metabolic disease risk . The snack product provide participant 20 % energy requirement via either whole almond muffins/crackers design mimic average UK snack .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects male female , age 3070 year regularly consume ≥2 snack product day . A principal aim identify recruit subject increase risk CVD , order increase sensitivity study subject dietary change . Subjects average risk develop CVD ( relative risk &gt; 1.5 ) select use metabolic scoring system ( score ≥2 point ) , adapt Framingham risk score system , use previously Chong et al . 2012 . Subjects give write informed consent . 1 . Nonsnack consumer ( assessed subject consume &lt; 2 snack product per day specific FFQ ( food frequency questionnaire ) screening , adapt short Health Survey England ( 2007 ) Eating Habits Questionnaire ) . 2 . A reported history myocardial infarction cancer . 3 . Being fitted heart pacemaker . 4 . Presence metal inside body ( implant , device , shrapnel , metal particle eye weld etc. ) . History blackouts/epilepsy . 5 . Diabetes mellitus ( fast plasma glucose &gt; 7 mmol/L ) . 6 . Chronic coronary , renal bowel disease history cholestatic liver disease pancreatitis . 7 . Presence gastrointestinal disorder use drug , likely alter gastrointestinal motility nutrient absorption . 8 . History substance abuse alcoholism ( past history alcohol intake &gt; 60 units/men 50 units/women ) . 9 . Currently pregnant , planning pregnancy , breastfeed baby last 12 month . 10 . Allergy intolerance nut . 11 . Unwilling follow protocol and/or give inform consent . 12 . Weight change &gt; 3 kg precede 2 month . BMI &lt; 18 kg/m2 ( underweight ) &gt; 40 kg/m2 ( morbidly obese due potential technical difficulty make FMD ambulatory blood pressure ( ABP ) measurement ) . 13 . Current smoker individual quit smoke within last 6 month . 14 . Participation research trial involve dietary drug intervention and/ blood collection past 3 month . 15 . Unable unwilling comply study protocol . 16 . The criterion measure use screen questionnaire physical ( blood pressure , weight , height ) biochemical measurement ( full lipid count , liver function test , full blood count , glucose insulin ) make screen visit . Participant eligibility assess inclusion/exclusion criterion 'fitness ' participate assess signed clinician .</criteria>
