	<brief_title>Use Endobronchial Ultrasound Scope ( EBUS ) Transducer Identify Pneumothorax-A Feasibility Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The use ultrasound diagnosis treatment patient well-established many decade . The use thoracic ultrasonography fairly new rapidly evolve field . The interface ultrasound probe chest wall produce artifact useful diagnose pneumothorax . In one prospective study utility ultrasound compare chest X-ray CT-scan trauma surgeon ( 1 ) . Their result demonstrate ultrasound sensitive chest X-ray identify early pneumothorax . The study also demonstrate 63 % pneumothorax diagnose occult would later diagnose CT chest . In critical situation subtle pneumothorax miss , bedside ultrasound proven accelerate diagnosis thus treatment . Similarly another prospective study note 76 % traumatic pneumothorax miss standard AP chest X-ray , interpret trauma team ( 2 ) . This number significantly higher retrospective study 55 % pneumothorax miss AP chest film review radiologist ( 3 ) . The sensitivity ultrasound detect pneumothorax demonstrate multiple study similar CT-scan , consider gold standard detection pneumothorax ( 4 , 5 ) . Visualization normal pleural lung slide sufficient exclude pneumothorax , lung slide present finding B line ( vertical line ) , usually originate lung parenchyma also exclude possibility pneumothorax interspace question , since lung parenchyma visualize air interposed pleura lung . Endobronchial ultrasound ( EBUS ) consider integral component diagnosis indeterminate mediastinal lymph node , mass peripheral pulmonary nodule . EBUS minimally invasive , safe highly accurate ( 6 ) . According current estimate incidence complication associate EBUS 1-1.5 % ( 6 , 7 ) . Major complication associate needle aspiration . The incidence pneumothorax find 3.3 % one retrospective analysis ( 8 ) , 31 % patient require chest tube eventually treatment pneumothorax . Post-procedure chest-X-rays commonly perform rule pneumothorax . Based current data chest-X-rays consider suboptimal diagnosis pneumothorax also expose patient undue radiation . The EBUS probe contain small ultrasound ultrasound image various structure i.e . lymph node , ventricle , pulmonary vasculature visualize . Ruling pneumothorax via lung ultrasound use EBUS probe never describe . If possible , avoids need obtain post-procedure Chest-X-rays thus decrease dose radiation exposure prevent time delay arrival chest-x-rays . In study demonstrate feasibility use transducer EBUS Bronchoscope perform bedside lung ultrasound rule pneumothorax .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . All patient present bronchoscopy ( These patient expect normal pleural slide sign identify ultrasound ) 2 . Patients pneumothorax require chest tube ( This group patient expect residual pneumothorax identification absence lung sliding , B line lung point ) 3 . Patients respiratory failure mechanical ventilation ( This group patient expect alveolointerstitial finding B line ) Absence inform consent</criteria>
