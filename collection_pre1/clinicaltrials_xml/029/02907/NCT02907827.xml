	<brief_summary>Patients locally advanced melanoma high risk recurrence follow surgical treatment . More patient stage IV melanoma remain complete remission follow systemic therapy . No standard establish surveillance patient high risk recurrence . Whole-body diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance image cfDNA analysis blood innovative image laboratory investigation may benefit early detection recurrence patient population .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cutaneous melanoma aggressive form skin cancer . Melanoma malignant cancer originate melanocyte body ( = pigment cell body ) . Melanoma originate melanocyte present skin , mucosa , uvea eye . The incidence melanoma continue rise rate exceed cancer . Every year approximately 132,000 1,000 people diagnose melanoma 37,000 250 people expect die disease respectively worldwide Belgium . Surgical resection curative case early identify localize melanoma ( 90 % long term survival stage I disease ) . Patients stage II/III disease high risk relapse surgery , even follow radiotherapy adjuvant IFN alfa-2b therapy ( risk recurrence patient 60 % 75 % ) . In 2010 Romano et al . publish study evaluate time relapse site relapse 340 patient ( Figure 1 : relapse free survival 340 patient substages IIIA , IIIB IIIc ) . Patients and/or family member discover 62 % local in-transit recurrence 49 % nodal recurrence . Only 37 % patient whose first recurrence systemic detect recurrence , either notice new tumor symptom lead evaluation . Physical examination physician account detection 36 % local in-transit recurrence , Twenty-six percent nodal recurrence detect physician however 9 % systemic recurrence discover systemic recurrence . In remain 63 % patient whose first detectable relapse systemic , relapse asymptomatic . Radiographic test , largely CT scan ( 72 % ) , detect asymptomatic systemic relapse 53 % ( n_87 ) patient . This study also demonstrate benefit identify early relaps , since symptomatic relapse , oppose relapse discover physical examination radiographic imaging , associate short survival . And confirm recurrence could completely resect associate longer survival ( relative risk_2.31 ; 95 % CI , 1.68 3.18 ; P_.001 ) . In last several year therapeutic landscape melanoma change . The introduction immunotherapy increase life expectancy melanoma stage IV patient even possibility cure disease . This change need screen . Since therapeutic option available , need strict follow-up . The primary objective follow-up patient melanoma identify potentially curable locoregional recurrence second primary cancer . Optimal follow-up strategy interval determine , consensus . At minimum , patient undergo annual routine physical examination , include full skin assessment palpation regional lymph node . The role image follow-up high risk patient clear . Since introduction newer therapy , need close follow-up emerge well . The outcome patient stage IV disease grim le 50 % patient survive 12 month . Short-lived tumor response obtain 10-20 % patient treat DTIC chemotherapy randomize trial could demonstrate survival benefit complex chemotherapy regimens so-called bio-chemotherapy regimen despite high response rate . In march 2011 CTLA-4 inhibitor , Ipilimumab ( Yervoy ) , aproved FDA . It first treatment prove survival benefit melanoma patient . An interesting aspect treatment Ipilimumab plateau see 2 years.This plateau represent patient long term survival benefit Ipilimumab even possibility 'cure ' . The patient population undergo repeat image PET CT and/or CT . This lead high radiation burden patient . The DW-MRI could population benefit .</detailed_description>
