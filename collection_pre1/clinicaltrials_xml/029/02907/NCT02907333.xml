	<detailed_description>Use condom show considerable protective effect , use correctly consistently , several sexually transmit infection ( STI ) , include HIV virus , trichomoniasis , chlamydia , gonorrhea . It indicate use condom also offer relatively good protection HPV infection . It furthermore indicate use condom woman CIN may increase regression rate lesion . The aim randomize control trial determine advise woman use condoms follow-up period CIN2 diagnosis increase regression rate . The advice base presumption condom use prevent HPV-infection reinfection extent thereby allow immune system clear HPV-infection `` repair '' CIN-lesion . Based literature , expect regression non-condom user around 22 % regression condom-users 2.5 time large . The clinical trial conduct randomized non-blinded control trial . The study conduct hospital- gynecological outpatient clinic Central Region Denmark Region Zealand . The gynaecologist obtain oral write consent woman abnormal cytology allow project physician contact telephone . The write consent compare list national pathology register diagnose CIN2 relevant region . If match two document , gynecologist contact find woman inform biopsy result follow-up 3-6 month decide . If case , woman include study randomize . We expect 700 woman randomize intervention- control arm . Women intervention arm receive information project telephone project physician . The intervention arm thereafter subdivide condom group non-condom group base woman 's acceptance intervention . Women condom group provide free condom entire study period . The project physician contact woman control group . From routine sample take first visit follow-up examination , HPV test request pathology department woman condom group . The woman also ask fill questionnaire follow-up . The information questionnaire use estimate compliance condom use background information woman condom group . The study approve Data Protection Agency Ethical Committee Capital Region Denmark . The total period time trial plan include woman one year last woman follow-up visit 18 month begin trial . The inclusion period expect commence 15.09.16 end 15.09.17 . Randomization conduct electronically statistician department neither investigator patient blind possible study design . Data study collect register questionnaire . All final result study publish relevant international journal . The project support fund receive sponsorship condom .
