	<detailed_description>Rationale : Airway disease , feature early intense inflammation lead progressive lung damage , main cause morbidity mortality cystic fibrosis ( CF ) . Mechanisms CF airway inflammation remain unclear , hamper development good treatment . Recent introduction heel-prick screening CF provide unique longitudinal cohort CF infant , early phase airway disease assess . In hospital investigator set clinical protocol monitoring infant structured way , use chest compute tomography ( CT ) bronchoscopies collection broncho-alveolar lavage fluid ( BALF ) assess early lung damage . Our protocol design accord protocol use Australian AREST-CF consortium . Preliminary data show lipid profile differ BALF CF infant high score lung damage , compare low score ( minimal lung damage ) . Some lipid product activate polymorphonuclear neutrophil ( PMN 's ) . Others receptor-activating molecule involve resolution inflammation tissue injury . Also , pilot study , show CF airway PMNs differently program normal airway , lead increased release inflammatory factor toxic enzyme . The hypothesize CFTR deficiency cause abnormal inflammatory signal lung CF infant , result abnormal programming infiltrate PMNs , subsequently excessive chronic lung disease . Objectives : To good understand progression early CF lung disease investigator aim study lipid profile PMN dysfunction relation severity early lung disease infant CF , use BALF sample peripheral blood . To optimally study precious sample , investigator make use state-of-the-art technology vivo profile vitro test PMN function , include lipidomics innovative cell- fluid-based tool . Understanding mechanisms play CF airway inflammation occur infant may lead new path early intervention Study design : Observational , exploratory vitro study BALF peripheral blood infant CF , correlate clinical data . Study population : Children CF diagnose heel-prick screening , bronchoscopy chest-CT annual check-up , age 3 month ( Utrecht ) ,1 , 3 5 year eligible . Informed consent obtain parent . Intervention : The bronchoscopy do collect BALF part routine clinical monitoring program . For study , BALF use clinical testing use . Furthermore , venous puncture perform clinical routine blood test , one extra vial EDTA blood drawn .</detailed_description>
