	<detailed_description>The aim study ass brain tissue perfusion ultrasound perfusion imaging ( UPI ) . The specific aim diagnose brain tissue hypoperfusion lead infarction due CVS ultrasound perfusion imaging ( UPI ) correlate gold standard diagnosis brain infarct , i.e . MRI CT . According contrast enhance UPI brain tissue classify ( 1 ) normal , i.e . lead tissue infarction , ( 2 ) hypoperfused , i.e . functionally impaired prone DIND infarction , ( 3 ) non-perfused . Thus , temporary hypoperfusion may resolve therapy spontaneously , lead tissue infarction shall assess . This strategy lead guide therapy UPI . Questionnaire : - ass cerebral perfusion patient SAH contrast enhance UPI - ass specificity sensitivity , well positive negative predictive value contrast enhanced UPI detection brain tissue misery perfusion lead infarction - evaluate feasibility practicability repeat bed-side assessment UPI - test whether treatment-effects like induced hypertension , balloon-dilation , intra-arterial nimodipine infusion detect quantified contrast enhance UPI - analyze whether TCD contrast enhance UPI superior screen CVS detection cerebral infarct ( vessel vs. tissue assessment ) - correlate contrast enhance UPI perfusion measurement CT-perfusion image Ultrasound perfusion imaging ( UPI ) able detect cerebral hypoperfusion result cerebral infarction clinical setting . As reference incidence cerebral infarct assess CT- MR-imaging cerebral perfusion analyze CT-perfusion ( CTP ) imaging . The day ictus ( SAH ) define day 0 . The ultrasound examination perform - Day 0-4 : one baseline UPI study perform . This time period ( 0-4 ) set baseline , baseline investigation perform vasospasm develops . The current policy early aneurysm treatment result clip coil patient within 24-48 hour . The relevant phase CVS , however , start day 4 5 ictus . The already establish routine protocol early CT CTP image aneurysm treatment allow differentiation infarct due procedure aneurysm clip coiling , bleeding , edema , surgical contusion cerebral infarct due CVS develop later . This early routine CT image include CT-perfusion study post-op day 1 , serve reference ultrasound perfusion measurement . - Day 5-14 : term high risk CVS , UPI study perform every second day . - Several event trigger additional UPI study : - angiography ( schedule emergency ) - endovascular intervention ( angioplasty intraarterial nimodipine infusion ) - CT MRI study new infarct - Development DIND reversal DIND - case placement intracerebral microprobe ( rCBF ptiO2 ) UPI study perform significant change ( rCBF drop 20ml/100g/min 60 % baseline , ptiO2 drop 10mmHg 60 % baseline ) occur . Currently patient scan MRI CT several time course disease . Each image study serf reference UPI . During day 5-14 high risk patient ( Fisher grade 3 , TCD &gt; 150 cm/sec , new deficit ) receive one CT-perfusion study day 7 11 ( period high risk ) . During day 5-14 patient proven CVS ( angiography ) receive two CT-perfusion study , one day 7 , one day 11 , time new deficit infarct evolve . Additional 20 % patient get MRI include perfusion weight imaging ( PWI ) . In patient misery perfusion detect PWI serf reference UPI . The actual UPI measurement take place bedside , perform study physician , take 15 -30 minute . The trial duration per patient 14 day initial hospitalization .</detailed_description>
