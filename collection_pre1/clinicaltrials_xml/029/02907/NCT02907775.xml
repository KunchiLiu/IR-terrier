	<brief_summary>Over 87,000 people first stroke UK year余 70 % victim alter arm function 40 % leave non-functional arm . Spasticity significant deterrent recovery arm function follow stroke . One four patient develop spasticity within first 2 week stroke 12 month 39 % spasticity . The use oral antispasticity medication like baclofen tizanidine often restrict due side effect like sedation , weakness floppiness . Compliance adult treatment oral anti spasticity drug around 50 % . There exploratory study sensory stimulation use Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation ( TENS ) reduce spasticity . Amatya et al review evidence conclude sufficient evidence recommend routine use . One possible explanation ineffectiveness TENS use single channel , single strength fix duration stimulation nervous system may get habituate . We develop Shefstim余 unique miniaturise 64 channel electrical stimulator . Using Shefstim pioneer technique call Sensory Barrage Stimulation 余rapid simultaneous stimulation multiple site , constantly change pattern . We hypothesise approach significantly reduce habituation compare single site stimulation , thus provide well treatment spasticity . Objective propose study explore feasibility conduct community base randomise cross trial compare SBS TENS post stroke upper limb spasticity elbow flexor optimise stimulation parameter quantify objectively muscular response two different stimulation protocol .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multi-channel Stimulation Post Stroke Spasticity ( MUSTS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We assess safety feasibility deliver SBS TENS upper limb spasticity community . The trial consider single blind assessor blind intervention . The investigator deliver intervention blind involved assessment outcome . Twenty men woman randomise receive either SBS TENS . Participants identify stroke clinic , Community physiotherapy service , Assessment Rehabilitation Centre Functional Electrical Stimulation clinic Sheffield . The treat team identify potential participant give information leaflet study . A member study team contact participant 7 14 day . Those agree participate study invite attend face face appointment member study team Royal Hallamshire Hospital . Visit-1 : During visit participant give opportunity discus study concern regard trial principal investigator . After principal investigator obtain informed consent . The participant ask perform Action Research Arm test ( ARAT ) include set activity like grasping , hold lift object affect unaffected arm record activity 16 arm muscle use electromyography motion sensor . This involve stick small sensor various muscle . The participant receive two different paradigm SBS 10 minute gap 10 minute effect EMG record . The participant carer train record severity spasticity diary 6pm 9pm scale range 0 10余 0- spasticity , 10 bad spasticity imagine . Visit-2 : The participant randomly allocate either group-1 group-2 use online randomisation system . A researcher blind allocation assessment . Another researcher deliver intervention . Participants group-1 receive TENS group-2 revive SBS extensor aspect upper arm one hour . The strength stimulation motor threshold maximum tolerable stimulation ever low . The stimulation cause tingle sensation . Some people may find stimulation slightly unpleasant . The researcher ass also look adverse event intervention . Participant carer train apply electrodes deliver intervention 1 hour day next 4 week . Visit 3 : The researcher ass participant also look adverse event intervention . Participant\carer ask continue record severity spasticity diary next one week . Visit-4 : After assessment participant group-1 receive TENS group-2 receive SBS one hour . As visit 2 , blind researcher check adverse event assess outcome measure stimulation . The participant carer train apply electrodes deliver intervention 1 hour day next 4 week . Visit 5 : The blinded researcher ass outcome measure also look adverse event intervention . Interventions : This occur three phase . Phase 1 : Subjects randomly allocate Group-1 receive TENS , Group-2 receive SBS , 60 minute day four week . We use remote randomisation telephone . Researcher-1 blind patient ' allocation group perform baseline assessment . The researcher -2 determine maximum tolerable level stimulation . The researcher-2 demonstrate participant \or carer apply stimulation instruct participant . The participant revive first intervention Royal Hallamshire Hospital supervision researcher-2 . The researcher-2 issue participant Group-2 ( SBS ) Shefstim six multichannel electrode . He \she instruct participant change electrode every 3 day . On 15th day researcher-2 visit home issue 6 multichannel electrode collect back previous set . At end week 4 , patient come Royal Hallamshire Hospital . The researcher-2 collect electrodes equipment back . The researcher-1 outcome assessment . Phase 2 : No intervention period two week . Phase 3 : Group-1 receive SBS , Group-2 receive TENS , 60 minute day four week . The first session SBS TENS take place Royal Hallamshire Hospital . SBS group : We use stimulation technique test previous study . Electrode array wear affected arm stimulation apply extensor aspect upper arm . At start first session , stimulation increase array movement first observe . The stimulation level set 90 % value , maximum tolerable pain report value record . Stimulation continue level move around array electrodes pseudo-random pattern 60 minute daily 4 week . TENS group : We use stimulation technique test previous study , include trial . Two surface electrode place radial nerve radial grove . The intensity stimulation set 90 % motor threshold . TENS apply 60 minute daily 4 week .</detailed_description>
