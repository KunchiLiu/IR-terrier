	<brief_summary>A Phase 3 , randomize , open-label , parallel-group , multicenter study design evaluate efficacy safety guadecitabine subject MDS CMML fail relapsed adequate prior treatment azacitidine , decitabine , . This global study conduct approximately 15 country . Approximately 408 subject approximately 100 study center randomly assign 2:1 ratio either guadecitabine ( approximately 272 subject ) Treatment Choice ( approximately 136 subject ) . The study consist 14-day screening period , treatment period , safety follow-up visit , long-term follow-up period . The study expect last 2 year , duration individual subject participation vary . Subjects may continue receive treatment long continue benefit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Multicenter , randomize , open-label , parallel-group study guadecitabine v Treatment Choice ( TC ) . Approximately 408 subject randomly assign 2:1 either guadecitabine TC . - Guadecitabine : approximately 272 subject . - TC : approximately 136 subject . Before randomization , investigator assign subject one follow TC option : - Low dose cytarabine ( LDAC ) . - Standard Intensive Chemotherapy ( IC ) 7+3 regimen . - Best Supportive Care ( BSC ) . BSC provide subject per standard institutional practice . Subjects randomize TC allow cross guadecitabine . Data review independent Data Monitoring Committee regular interval , primarily evaluate safety study conduct . Randomization stratify disease category ( MDS v CMML ) , bone marrow ( BM ) blast ( BM blast &gt; 10 % v BM blast ≤10 % ) , TC option ( LDAC vs IC v BSC ) , study center region . Guadecitabine : 60 mg/m2 give SC daily Days 1-5 28-day cycle ( delay need allow blood count recovery ) . Treatment give least 6 total cycle absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression require alternative therapy . Beyond 6 cycle , treatment continue long subject continue benefit . BSC give accord standard institutional practice . Treatment Choice ( TC ) : Before randomization , investigator assign subject one follow TC option : - Low dose cytarabine ( LDAC ) give 20 mg/m2 SC IV daily 14 day 28-day cycle ( delay need allow blood count recovery ) . Treatment give least 4 cycle absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Standard Intensive Chemotherapy ( IC ) 7+3 regimen : give cytarabine 100-200 mg/m2/day give continuous infusion 7 day anthracycline give per institutional standard practice daunorubicin ( 45-60 mg/m2/day ) , idarubicin ( 9-12 mg/m2/day ) , mitoxantrone ( 8-12 mg/m2/day ) intravenous infusion 3 day . - Best Supportive Care ( BSC ) : give accord standard institutional practice . BSC include , limited blood transfusion ( RBCs platelet ) , growth factor include erythropoiesis stimulating agent ( ESA ) , granulocyte stimulating factor ( GSFs ) , iron chelate therapy , broad spectrum antibiotic and/or antifungal .</detailed_description>
