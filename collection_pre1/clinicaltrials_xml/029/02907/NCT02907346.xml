	<detailed_description>The purpose pilot project evaluate effectiveness behavioral economic intervention increase use continuous glucose monitor ( CGM ) adolescents young adult T1D . This study do conjunction Nancy Petry , PhD research team University Connecticut School Medicine ( UConn Health ) . The intervention reinforce patient wear CGM upload review data . A 6-month pilot trial conduct 20 patient receive intervention . The specific aim : 1 . To estimate well reinforcement intervention increase usage CGM . The proportion day participant wear CGM determine well number week CGM wear least 5 day . We compare usage rate pilot trial historical control data patient initiate CGM . 2 . To evaluate association CGM usage A1c . We expect A1c decrease time patient receive reinforcement intervention . Patients continue use CGM expect great decrease A1c patient discontinue usage . Evaluations conduct time CGM initiation , 6 , 13 , 19 , 26 , 39 week treatment initiation ass effect intervention estimate effect size . In addition primary aim , secondary outcome also evaluate . Continued use CGM expect improve aspect diabetes management daily function . Predictors continue CGM usage improvement A1c also evaluate . Results pilot study instrumental guiding subsequent , large long term randomize study evaluate reinforcement intervention improve uptake CGM , diabetes-related adherence behavior , long-term outcome .</detailed_description>
