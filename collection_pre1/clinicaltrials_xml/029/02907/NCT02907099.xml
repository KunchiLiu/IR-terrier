	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab BL-8040 Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : Each cycle 21 day ( 3 week ) . If find eligible take part study , Days 1-5 8-12 Cycle 1 , receive BL-8040 injection skin . After Cycle 1 , receive BL-0840 Days 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 cycle . You receive BL-08040 Days 15-21 . On Day 1 Cycles 2 beyond , receive pembrolizumab vein 30 minute . You receive pembrolizumab Cycle 1 . You give standard drug ( hydrocortisone diphenhydramine ) help decrease risk side effect . You may ask study staff information drug give risk . Length Treatment : You may receive pembrolizumab BL-8040 1 year . You longer able receive treatment disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Study Visits : On Days 1 8 cycle : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . Before dose BL-8040 , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . One ( 1 ) time Week 4 every 3 week : - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) urine collect routine test . - During Weeks 1 , 4 , 7 blood ( 5 tablespoon ) draw biomarker tumor marker test . During Week 7 , tumor biopsy learn study drug affect disease . The study doctor discus type biopsy . Every 9 week , MRI CT scan . End-of-Treatment Visit : Within 1 week last dose study drug : - You physical exam . vYou CT MRI check status disease . - Blood ( 5 tablespoon ) draw routine , tumor marker , biomarker test . Follow-Up Visits : About 30 day last dose study drug , call member study staff ask side effect . This call last 5-10 minute . About every 10 week last dose study drug , CT scan MRI physical exam . This continue unless disease get bad start new anti-cancer treatment . Every 12 week , call member study staff ask . Each call last 5-10 minute . You continue call unless withdraw study study end , whichever happen first . This investigational study . Pembrolizumab FDA approve commercially available treatment melanoma lung cancer ; however , FDA approve pancreatic cancer . BL-8040 FDA approve commercially available treatment pancreatic cancer . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 15 participant take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
