	<brief_summary>Patients risk respiratory depression surgery . The medication patient treat control pain impair breathe progress respiratory cardiac arrest even death . Vital sign assessment surgical ward usually do every 4 hour may insufficient identify manage many case respiratory depression . The aim study determine impact safety nursing workflow respiratory monitor two surgical ward measure safety outcome . Respiratory depression serious complication pain treatment lead patient complication death . The level monitoring available hospital nurse staff insufficient manage problem . If new monitor technology work design patient safety improve maintaining effective pain therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients risk respiratory depression perioperative period . The opioids use patient control analgesia ( PCA ) epidural analgesia cause respiratory depression . The progression opioid side effect usually start sedation , respiratory depression follow , leave uncorrected , lead respiratory cardiac arrest death . Sedation common side-effect , occur 13 % patient incidence respiratory depression varies depend precise definition use analgesia modality , report occur 1 % case . If continuously monitor patient oximetry capnography incidence respiratory depression show much high , high 12 % 8 . The incidence cardiac arrest death opioid overdose estimate 2 case per 10 , 0009 . Given number patient undergoing surgery annually 100 million worldwide , respiratory depression occur 1 12 million time result 20 , 000 preventable death year10 . The troublesome aspect complication often occur healthy patient family clinical staff anticipate bad outcome . The problem unexpected respiratory depression amongst patient treated opioids compound challenge deal obstructive sleep apnea patient perioperative period . Obstructive sleep apnea , characterize complete partial obstruction upper airway sleep , rare , 25 % general population ( great proportion surgical population ) risk condition . These patient even great risk perioperative respiratory event consequently guideline American Society Anesthesiology recommend continuous monitoring patients13,14 . These guideline expert-based clinical trial establish efficacy continuous monitor population . These two problem ( respiratory depression opioids obstructive sleep apnea ) cause significant logistic problem hospital many institution equipment provide continuous monitoring patient outside intensive care unit limit capacity critical care area monitor patient risk . The impact respiratory depression mitigate recognize early enough appropriate action take resuscitate patient . Early recognition complication depend frequent regular vital sign assessment nursing staff . problem many surgical ward nurse staff , particularly night , spread thin patient occasionally go several hour without see . In period patient spiral trouble sedation respiratory depression eventually respiratory cardiac arrest . Previously , cardiac monitoring telemetry available could use patient perioperative period . Although telemetry proven useful group patient ( include automate defibrillator fire , prolong QT interval acute heart failure ) technology pick case respiratory depression progress cardiac event15 . Recently technology become commercially available continuously monitor pulse oximetry notify clinical staff wirelessly via page system . The advantage system clinician notify immediately patient begin decompensate respiratory depression within enough time initiate resuscitation patient progress respiratory cardiac arrest . Another benefit system patient risk monitor regular surgical ward without utilize additional nursing staff . A recent literature search ( MEDLINE ) search concepts respiratory monitoring perioperative period ( use MESH keywords : monitoring , oximetry , postoperative period clinical trial ) conduct see evidence support use system . Only single study identify search specifically investigated postoperative period , before-after study 36-bed orthopedic ward find respiratory monitoring system effective reduce need rescue resuscitation ICU transfers16 . Although Cochrane review pulse oximetry perioperative monitoring , study focus intraoperative recovery room monitoring address monitoring patient surgical wards17 . Given promising result , respiratory monitoring trialed two surgical ward Juravinski Hospital Hamilton , Ontario . In order evaluate impact technology investigator design randomize control trial determine routine wireless respiratory monitor 72 hour surgical patient two surgical ward ( care general surgery , urology gynecology-oncology patient ) reduces need rescue resuscitation - Naloxone resuscitation opioid overdose , Code Blues ( Cardio-respiratory arrest ) Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) transfer . In addition , study also evaluate risk factor respiratory depression , type duration respiratory alarm occur impact nursing workflow .</detailed_description>
