	<brief_summary>LifeSeal™ Kit , surgical sealant design staple-line reinforcement apply anastomotic line prevent bowel content leakage full physiological function restore . RATIONALE : Postoperative anastomotic leakage one devastating fear complication colorectal surgery . The risk postoperative anastomotic leakage varies widely depend level anastomosis risk high low anastomosis . In order best demonstrate benefit LifeSeal™ provide staple line reinforcement help reduce leak , study include high risk anastomosis , define colorectal coloanal anastomosis perform within 10 cm anal verge . STUDY DESIGN : This study design prospective , multi-center , multinational randomize , single-blind , double arm study PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : The primary objective study assess efficacy safety LifeSeal™ Kit measure change overall anastomotic leak rate subject undergo low anterior resection anastomosis 10 cm anal verge , first 17 week surgery . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : The secondary objective study assess incidence post-operative leak additional benefit could relate use LifeSeal™ Kit reduce severity improve outcome leak occur . In addition , study allow collection analysis additional safety data usability assessment device , medical resource utilization , health relate quality life measure .</brief_summary>
