	<brief_summary>Ultrasound represent attractive non-invasive method ass hemodynamic status . Understanding dynamic change hemodynamics situation hypovolemia , sepsis , cardiogenic shock potentially help improve patient care . However , inter-rater reliability accuracy various ultrasound measurement reflect dynamic change physiology remain incompletely understood . Overall aim investigate use ultrasound control setting , specifically use low body negative pressure ( LBNP ) , simulate hypovolemia vary level human volunteer . Aim 1 : To determine change carotid blood flow ( measure velocity time integral , VTI ) subject undergoing simulated hypovolemia LBNP level precede vital sign change . Hypothesis : Carotid VTI demonstrate significant change precede vital sign change simulate hypovolemia . Aim 2 : To compare transcranial color Doppler indices cerebral blood flow carotid blood flow , assessed VTI common carotid artery . Hypothesis : Changes transcranial color Doppler indices cerebral blood flow mirror change carotid blood flow , indicate carotid VTI adequate surrogate measure cerebral blood flow variable state central hypovolemia . However , cerebral blood flow remain constant carotid blood flow throughout vary level hypovolemia , assumption cerebral autoregulation alters relationship carotid cerebral blood flow . The complex procedure Transcranial Doppler ultrasound ( TCD ) must perform obtain valid assessment cerebral blood flow .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Design : This prospective laboratory study use human volunteer . Study Setting Subjects : The study take place The John B . Pierce Laboratory volunteer subject low body negative pressure use on-site LBNP chamber . Protocol : Study subject instruct refrain caffeine , alcohol , cigarette within 12 hour protocol , otherwise allow routine oral intake prior enrollment . The chamber construct seal wood acrylic box connect vacuum . Subjects place chamber , seal level pelvis neoprene skirt . Chamber pressure transduce electronic digital manometer . The pressure chamber reduce rapidly hold 15-minute interval -5 , -10 , -15 , -20 mm Hg . If subject becomes lightheaded , nauseate , tolerate test run way ; negative pressure stop . Subjects monitor continuous electrocardiogram monitoring , standard automate blood pressure cuff , noninvasive beat-to-beat hemodynamic monitor ( Finometer , Finapres Medical Systems , Amsterdam , The Netherlands ) . All carotid ultrasound measurement perform specifically trained emergency physician , use Philips ultrasound machine ( Philips Medical Systems , Andover , MA ) equip phased linear array probe program Doppler capability . For transcranial Doppler imaging , use 5- 1-MHz sector array transducer Iu-22 ultrasound system ( Philips Healthcare , Best , Netherlands ) . Duplex sonography perform low end frequency range ( 1-2 MHz ) good sound wave penetration select bone window . For common carotid artery transcranial portion study , obtain spectral Doppler waveform tracing record measurement correspond vessel diameter . We use data generate software analysis spectral tracing calculate hemodynamic parameter interest study . Calculations base Bernoulli 's principle fluid dynamic .</detailed_description>
