	<brief_title>Impact Reducing Dietary Intake Red Processed Meat Intake Fasting Lipemia Healthy Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In UK adult , meat provide approximately 40 % average daily protein intake make significant contribution intake thiamin , niacin , vitamin B12 , iron , zinc , potassium , phosphorus . However , excessive consumption , particularly red process meat , associate increase risk develop range chronic disease , include cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , obesity , type 2 diabetes cancer . Meat production significantly contribute production greenhouse gas ( GHG ) hence global warming . Given predict global increase human population , couple rise demand meat within emerge economy , suggest concerted effort make alter dietary pattern reduce meat intake . Moreover , number report suggest replace meat non-meat protein-rich product health benefit . Such product tend inherently low total saturate fat , high fibre , could also cardioprotective . The aim trial investigate whether , appropriate non/reduced-meat alternative motivational support , free living subject significantly reduce meat intake whether dietary change positively impact range cardiovascular risk factor . Trial design ; A non-randomised , single group study design , initial control period use . Participants ; Forty healthy men woman recruit general population Nottinghamshire , UK . All participant attend David Greenfield Human Physiology Unit ( Queen 's Medical Centre , Nottingham , UK ) initial medical screen visit confirm health status . In addition , blood pressure ( BP ) measure left upper arm ( lie semi-supine 5min ) use automate oscillometry , body mass index ( BMI ) calculate measured height weight . If participant suitable take part regard health questionnaire BMI measure , venous blood sample take assess full blood count , urea , electrolyte . Those take lipid-lowering medication , report use nutritional strategy lower cholesterol , exclude . Participants accept onto trial report habitual consumption 4-5 portion red and/or process meat per week ( 3-4 consume main meal ) , food allergy relate soya mycoprotein , demonstrate clinically significant abnormality screen . Study Protocol ; After recruitment , participant ask record food intake ( include snack drink ) diet diary , 4 day ( 3x week work day , 1x weekend rest day ) prior assessment visit 1 , baseline assessment macronutrient energy intake . Individuals ask complete 4-day diet diary week assessment visit 2,3 4 ( week 4 , 10 , 16 ) , assess change macronutrient energy intake meat consumption may occur consequence intervention . Household measure use estimate portion size , diary analyse use food composition database . To calculate habitual diet composition , mean daily intake obtain 4 day record period , data combine produce group mean . Assessment visit take place morning individual fast midnight night . Initially , measurement body mass make near 0.1kg use Seca 882 Digital Scale , waist hip circumference assess ( participant standing ) mid-way low rib iliac crest , great trochanter , respectively . Participants ask rest , semi-supine , couch &gt; 5min rest BP measure , estimation body composition make use bioelectrical impedance . A 5ml fasting blood sample take determination serum insulin , total cholesterol , high density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL ) , low density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL ) , triacyl glyceride ( TAG ) whole blood glucose . In subset cohort ( n=26 , 13 Male:13 Female ) , flow mediate dilatation ( FMD ) also measure laboratory visit fast , rest semi-supine 1 2 hour . Intervention ; After visit 1 ( week 0 ) assessment , participant ask make change lifestyle continue habitual diet visit 2 ( week 4 ) second assessment make ( 'control ' period ) . The 12 week 'intervention ' period begin day second study visit . Participants give information regard meat intake safely reduce diet , include recipe book contain idea meal use meat analogue protein source . A range frozen meat-free ( soya mycoprotein 'mince ' , mycoprotein sausage , meatball 'steak strip ' ) reduce meat product ( pork sausage , beef meatball , beef mince beef burger make 50 % meat 50 % soya mycoprotein ) available participant use aid reduction red meat intake . In addition , range dry bean ( red kidney , haricot , black turtle ) , pulse ( chick pea , green red lentil ) grain ( quinoa ) also offer . Weekly telephone contact study participant maintain intervention period improve compliance , identify problem arrange food delivery .</detailed_description>
