	<detailed_description>In new area multiples new treatment advance PCa could propose elderly patient , evaluate , understand analyse incidence , severity cognitive dysfunction impact quality life , autonomy adherence among group vulnerable patient advanced disease challenge essential help clinician take care patient . As deficit may subtle always related complaint , cognitive function need assess objective sensitive neuropsychological test patient-perceived cognitive self-report questionnaire . In addition treatment , range potential confounders contribute cognitive impairment , co-medications , psychological factor ( e.g . anxiety depression ) , fatigue , cognitive reserve ( i.e . patient high education , occupational attainment , participation leisure activity report le clinical cognitive change age . The evaluation comprehension cognitive decline patient treated cancer complex need multidisciplinary approach human science strong link clinician biologist researcher . Therefore , study propose original unique comprehensive interdisciplinary approach interface public health , clinical research , psychology biology would direct impact cancer patient care , include consortium neuropsychologists , oncologist biologist researcher work together within North West canceropole `` cognition cancer '' program . In evaluate cognitive function , mood , quality life adherence treatment , fully scope proposal , help improve knowledge new field research human health among cancer patient direct impact physicians patient . The strength project propose ( complement study conduct among patient ) comprehensive approach include animal model behavioural task recommend ICCTF ( International Cognition Cancer Task Force ) . This study first one address question impact novel oral hormonal agent among elderly metastatic prostate cancer patient . This study assess influence treatment patient ' cognitive function longitudinal basis evaluate quality life adherence patient develop cognitive disorder .</detailed_description>
