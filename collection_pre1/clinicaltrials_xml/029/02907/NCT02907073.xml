	<brief_title>PET ( Positron Emission Tomography ) Imaging Studies With NIS Reporter</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>F-18 tetrafluoroborate ( BF4 ) ( TFB ) use PET ( Positron Emission Tomography ) image biomarker expression human sodium/iodide symporter ( hNIS ) tissue . Imaging functional hNIS activity tissue [ 18F ] BF4 anticipate provide superior sensitivity image quality I-123 Tc-99m SPECT monitoring hNIS transduction effect viral therapy . The proposed work design 1 ) evaluate safety , biodistribution , metabolism radiation dosimetry characteristic 8 healthy human volunteer 2 ) evaluate image feasibility comparison I-123 Tc-99m SPECT hNIS expression ) 10 myeloma patient treat Edmonston Measles virus-NIS ( MV-NIS ) b ) 10 endometrial cancer patient treat vesicular stomatitis virus engineer express human interferon-and NIS ( VSV-hINF-NIS ) . This data necessary support future regulatory submission .</detailed_description>
