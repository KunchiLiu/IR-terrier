	<brief_summary>A pregnancy consider `` prolonged '' 41 week gestation . Prolonged Pregnancies ( PP ) associate increased maternal morbidity : emergency caesarean , 3rd 4th degree perineal lesion postpartum haemorrhage . Foetuses increase risk oligohydramnios , meconium-staining Fetal Heart Rate ( FHR ) anomaly . Around 15 % pregnancy prolong . A Cochrane review induction labour show policy labour induction beyond 41 week associate significantly few perinatal death . Thus French College Obstetricians Gynaecologists state , `` induction labour propose patient 41+0 41+6 week gestation '' . In case labour induced cervix unfavourable , cervical ripening advise . Methods cervical ripen include pharmacological ( prostaglandin ) mechanical ( Foley catheter trans-cervical double balloon ) method . Those two method compare PROBAAT trial among woman term pregnancy ( beyond 37+0 ) . The rate caesarean section two strategy identical , however uterine hyper stimulation FHR anomaly occur less cervical ripen mechanical . Considering pharmacological cervical ripening associate uterine hyper stimulation FHR anomaly , may appropriate case fragile foetus include case prolonged pregnancy . Considering prolonged pregnancy associate risk FHR anomalies cervical ripen pharmacological method another factor increase risk : woman prolong pregnancy could benefit `` gentle '' cervical ripening . At present , particular method recommend case cervical ripen prolonged pregnancy . We hypothesise , case prolong pregnancy , mechanical cervical ripening , less uterine hyperstimulation few FHR anomaly , could appropriate could reduce rate caesarean section suspicion fetal distress .</brief_summary>
