	<detailed_description>This K23 research train award advance long-term goal improve treatment outcome reduce transmission HIV among HIV-infected drug user . The proposed training research plan enable PI develop skill need independent research career area illicit drug use HIV adherence intervention . The objective award develop skill implementation science , behavioral intervention development evaluation drug use population , in-depth qualitative data analysis accelerate refinement effective implementation intervention HIV-infected drug user . Multiple comorbidities drug use HIV act synergistically produce poor health outcome increase morbidity , mortality , transmission HIV . Consequently , effective sustainable intervention adapt drug user improve antiretroviral medication adherence reduce risk behavior urgently need . Drug user present unique treatment challenge compare HIV-infected population , include low rate adherence inferior treatment outcome . Additionally , interpersonal factor , include social support , negative patient-provider interaction , socioeconomic challenge present significant barrier adherence . Thus , generalizability current adherence intervention drug user limit , press need efficacious intervention adapt HIV-infected drug use population . This project address gap first adapt test acceptability efficacy combine adherence brief motivational intervention HIV-infected drug user . Specifically , intervention augment establish Life Steps adherence intervention include : ( 1 ) tailor Life Steps module address unique need illicit drug user , aim improve medication adherence ; ( 2 ) brief Motivational Interview address drug use risk behavior ; ( 3 ) two follow-up booster session . A three-phase , top-down research approach adapt , refine , pilot test intervention conduct . Phase 1 include focus group HIV-infected drug user currently prescribe antiretroviral medication individual interview community-based clinician . Phase 2 include manual development , therapist training , pilot trial , in-depth qualitative interview , manual revision . Phase 3 include small , 2-armed ( intervention vs. health education control ) randomize control trial 60 HIV-infected drug user . Feasibility , acceptability , preliminary indication improvement antiretroviral adherence reduction drug use examine 1- , 3- , 6-month follow-up . To enable PI pursue long-term research agenda , work experience mentor build three area expertise : ( 1 ) proficiency qualitative research method analysis ; ( 2 ) skill intervention development evaluation illicit drug use population ; ( 3 ) expertise advance longitudinal data analysis ; ( 4 ) implementation science . This K23 study address key priority HIV treatment science , fully prepare PI independent research career HIV intervention scientist .</detailed_description>
