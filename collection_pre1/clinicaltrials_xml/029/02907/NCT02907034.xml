	<brief_summary>Financials constraint health system require suitable index criteria good allocate resource order enhance maximize social welfare . Among multiple method , quality-adjusted life year ( QALY ) use validate preference-base measure health care procedures health economics study cost-utility analysis . In France , methodological guide public agency High Authority Health ( HAS ) recommend valuation health state use generic descriptive instrument ( EQ5D ) , validate Time Trade Off method ( TTO ) sample general French population . Although appear legitimate distribute collective resource base general population preference , major concern individual face real choice direct implication welfare life . The existence discrepancy reveal `` hypothetical '' preference real preference would raise problem concern production currently available standard norm . Hence , methodological deepening preference revelation process necessary . Virtual reality ( VR ) could play key role resolve methodological problem . Widely used field health ( therapy , medical training ... ) , VR simulation seek approach reality , without try quite like . It aim one individual explore sensorimotor cognitive activity artificial world 3D , `` imaginary , symbolic simulation aspect real world '' ( Fuchs , 2006 ) . VR could well applied field health economics offer hypothetical scenario different health state EQ5D individual might experience first person . To date , existence discrepancy reveal `` hypothetical '' preference actual preference individual general population extremely difficult explore . However , important methodological challenge revelation preference guide health-related decision . Indeed , compare reveal preference health state establish first person experience VR reveal preference establish classic narrative approach without VR , may provide accurate approach actual real preference individual general population . Moreover , another advantage VR permit assessment great number health state , method faster processed narrative approach : individual experiment immediate experience situation VR . Thus , VR method may overcome technical constraint classic narrative approach concern limited sample size norm production . To investigator knowledge , VR never propose valuate health condition . This study would report relevance interest use VR ( immersive immediate life situation experience ) production utility EQ5D health state value general population revelation preference method call Time Trade Off ( TTO ) , currently approach recommend HAS . Using VR could circumvent limitation current narrative approach : would provide good feasibility acceptability among subject , few inconsistency , easy wide access disadvantage individual . Eventually revision available standard could propose allow HAS policy maker base choice reliable , standardized accurate classification health state condition , associate health state predefined value .</brief_summary>
