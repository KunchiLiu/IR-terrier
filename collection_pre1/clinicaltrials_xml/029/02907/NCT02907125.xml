	<detailed_description>Background objective : India home 358 million young people age group 10 24 ; 243 million 10 19 year age . This represent huge opportunity transform social economic fortune country . Key public health challenge adolescent India include unwanted pregnancy , sexually transmit reproductive tract infection , injury , grow misuse alcohol , tobacco substance , mental health problem depression , anxiety disorder suicide . Schools provide ideal platform address health issue World Health Organization 's Health Promoting Schools framework seek address structural determinant health concern . The recent Cochrane review assess school- base intervention find 'whole school ' 'school environment ' intervention effective address range health outcome among adolescent include bullying , aggression , tobacco use . However , comparable evidence effectiveness cost-effectiveness school-based health promotion program India . Sangath implement SEHER-Strengthening Evidence base school-based intErventions pRomoting adolescent health ( ClinicalTrials.gov ID : NCT02484014 ) , jointly fund programme ( The MacArthur Foundation United Nation 's Population Development Fund , India ) seek develop evaluate comprehensive adolescent health promotion intervention deliver two different delivery agent viz . teacher SEHER Mitra ( TSM ) lay health worker call SEHER Mitra ( SM ) government run secondary school Bihar , India . Following hypothesis address SEHER trial : 1 . For primary outcome measure : It hypothesize intervention strategy addition usual intervention ( Tarang-AEP ) grade effect overall school climate . 2 . For secondary outcome measure : The intervention build positive attitude towards gender equity , build knowledge attitude towards reproductive sexual health , reduce self-reported bullying , violence depression . 3 . For exploratory outcome measure : The intervention decrease tobacco , alcohol substance use , reduce suicide behaviour ( suicide thought attempt ) increase safe sexual behaviour . Hypotheses SEHER Plus : The SEHER Plus address additional benefit provide exposure intervention activity two year versus one year . For primary outcome measure : The student exposure SEHER intervention activity addition usual intervention ( Tarang-AEP ) two academic year ( Class IX X ) show great benefit overall school climate student exposure SEHER intervention activity usual intervention ( Tarang-AEP ) one academic year ( Class IX ) . For secondary outcome measure : The student exposure SEHER intervention activity addition usual intervention ( Tarang-AEP ) two academic year ( Class IX X ) show improve positive attitude towards gender equity , increase knowledge attitude towards reproductive sexual health , reduce self-reported bullying , violence depression student exposure SEHER intervention activity usual intervention ( Tarang-AEP ) one academic year ( Class IX ) . For secondary outcome measure : The student exposure SEHER intervention activity addition usual intervention ( Tarang-AEP ) two academic year ( Class IX X ) report reduce incidence tobacco , alcohol substance use , reduce incidence self-reported suicide attempt reduce incidence sexual behaviour student exposure SEHER intervention activity usual intervention ( Tarang-AEP ) one academic year ( Class IX ) . The SEHER intervention already exist Tarang-AEP enhance effect mention outcome ; effect minimal moderate among student two year exposure low resource intensity intervention ( Teacher-as-SEHER Mitra : Arm-I ) , effect greatest significant among student two year exposure high resource intensity intervention ( School Mitra : Arm-II ) . Randomisation : The school unit randomisation allocate one intervention arm comparison use minimisation pilot study SEHER project ( June 2014-March 2015 ) . Although , usually pilot study would conduct different school main trial , possible SEHER conduct pilot study main trial school new cohort standard IX student enter school every year . Before randomisation , list eligible school randomisation ( n=112 ) total number secondary high secondary school Nalanda district Bihar ( n=136 ) generate . The following criterion use generate list : implementation Tarang-AEP programme , total number student school , total number employ teacher school . Of 112 school , 75 randomly select random allocation . To representative pool 75 school , ensure equal number school type three trial arm , 68 % co-educational ( 63 93 ) , 69 % girl ' ( 9 13 ) 50 % boy ' school ( 3 6 ) select . All 75 school allocate comparison one intervention arm use minimization . To carry allocation minimisation , arm balance follow variable ( variable classify category ) : 1 . Type school ( secondary= 1 ; secondary high secondary school= 2 ) ; 2 . School size ( small=100-300 ; medium=301-600 , large=601 student ) , 3 . Nature school ( Co-education=1 ; boys'=2 ; girl ' =3 ) . The random allocation use minimization carry independent statistician ( Gian Luca DiTanna , LSHTM ) use R software package . One school TSM arm drop pilot study hence 24 school arm . Sample size : All student enrol class IX academic year March 2015- April 2016 student enrol class IX academic year March 2016- April 2017 invite participate outcome assessment complete December 2016/January 2017 . The investigator collect baseline assessment student enrol Class IX academic year 2016-17 . As part SEHER trial , student enrol class IX academic year 2015-16 participate two outcome assessment ; one July 2015 March/April 2016 . Process Evaluation : Process evaluation integral part research design examine quality programme implementation ( i.e . integrity fidelity ) , completeness delivery , extent stakeholder engage . In , help explain programme 's outcome identify way improve and/or replicate . Two type indicator collate evaluate fidelity delivery SEHER intervention , viz . quantity quality . Nested qualitative evaluation : A qualitative evaluation conduct end intervention : ) explore deliverer ' recipient ' response intervention , b ) explore school community perception effect SEHER intervention student ' health academic attainment . The qualitative component comprise focus group discussion single sex group class IX X student , TSMs SMs , in-depth interview purposively select male female student class IX X avail counsel service , principal , Tarang nodal teacher teacher , TSMs/SMs supervisor . Data management : Two type quantitative data collect : intervention process , outcome assessment . All outcome assessment data collect paper form , process data TSMs/SMs . All data manually entered Access database . Range consistency check perform monthly interval process data . Queries identify resolve promptly trial management team , database update , maintain audit trail . All data keep separate database merge master database data collection complete individual database lock . All process data backed-up external hard disk monthly basis . Access pre-locked data password protect multiple level member trial team apart data manager independent statistician access password . After dataset lock , dataset remain password-protected trial investigator access datasets . For data , separate file link name trial identification code keep password protect . Analysis : Quantitative analysis carry use STATA ( version 14 ) . Below summary investigator 's approach analysis . A detailed analysis plan agree Data Safety Monitoring Board towards end trial and/or analysis undertaken . Descriptive analysis : Initial analysis describe characteristic enrol participant within across arm ( example : age socioeconomic background ) . The outcome measure summarise end-line cluster , arm-wise year-wise exposure , overall . These summarise mean ( SD ) , median ( Inter- Quartile Range ) number proportion appropriate key relevant subgroup ( age , gender ) . Outcome analysis : The primary analysis , base cross sectional survey , intention-to-treat end trial use multi-level model take account cluster school level . Gender-wise sub-group analysis perform . The trial outcomes evaluate primary secondary outcome base change intervention arm compare change comparison . The primary trial impact comparison arm-wise analysed student exposure intervention activity two academic year student exposure intervention activity one academic year . Mixed effect regression perform analyse change primary secondary outcomes school-level . Effect size present risk ratio binary outcome ( e.g . experience bullying ) , mean difference continuous outcome ( e.g . overall school climate score ) ; 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) derive . The reporting presentation trial accordance CONSORT guideline cluster randomise trial , primary comparative analysis conduct intention-to-treat basis .</detailed_description>
