	<detailed_description>Lipedema According epidemiological study Földi E Földi M , lipedema affect 11 % female population . Rarely , men hypogonadism , growth hormone deficiency , liver disease may develop lipedema . Drs . Allen Hines Mayo clinic define lipedema 1940 shortly thereafter provide diagnostic criterion lipedema : 1 . Almost exclusive occurrence woman develop third decade life 2 . Bilateral symmetrical nature minimal involvement foot , result `` inverse shouldering '' , `` bracelet '' `` cuff '' effect ankle 3 . Minimal pit edema ( non-pitting edema present ) 4 . Pain , tenderness , easy bruise 5 . Persistent enlargement despite elevation extremity weight loss . 6 . Increased vascular fragility ; easy bruising There three stage lipedema Stage 1 : Normal skin surface enlarge hypodermis Stage 2 : Uneven skin peau d'orange mattress-like texture large mound tissue size walnut apple include formation lipoma angiolipomas , large indentation fat Stage 3 : Much large mound huge lobule tissue occur cause deformation especially around knee Progression lymphedema , call lipolymphedema ( Stage 4 ) develop Stage commonly occur people Stage 3 . Obesity occur along lipedema especially Stage 3 . Lifestyle improvement always consider obesity associate lipedema lifestyle cause lipedema cure . Women lipedema obvious disparity large quantity gynoid distribute painful fat low body ( hip , buttock , leg ) compare trunk , head face result low waist hip ratio ( WHR ) . The disparity result failure lipedema SAT reduce response extreme caloric restriction , include bariatric procedure , intensive daily exercise . It unclear drive maintain lipedema SAT body . The SAT begin typical gynoid location ( hip , buttock , leg ) woman lipedema diabetes metabolic syndrome suggest lipedema SAT may protective cardiovascular disease similar gynoid fat . However , addition cosmetically devastate many woman , lipedema fat increase risk development mobility issue , joint damage , chronic pain lymphedema . Quad Rivas Therapy® The Quad Rivas Therapy® deep tissue `` hand '' touch therapy SAT treat body anatomical physiological unit - area contain SAT treat focus improve function blood vasculature , lymph vasculature , nerve , biomechanical system ( muscle , tendon fascia ) . The Quad Rivas Therapy® ensure four system improve , focus vascular system . Tissues decrease blood supply due enlarge SAT mass , fibrosis fascia disease need manipulation able function properly , allow easy flow tissue . The Quad Rivas Therapy , therapist us specialize grip technique enable therapist 'open ' 'unravel ' tissue optimal blood supply . Another tissue technique , call `` hook technique '' allow therapist ensure stimulation blood flow . Blood vessel gain elasticity back , fibrosis vein resolve body able repair . The Quad Rivas Therapy® theory puberty influence hormone , lipedema SAT outgrow ability muscle use break fat result excess SAT mass . This combination vascular , especially venous , insufficiency , affect many woman young age , create progressive disease generate blockage metabolism associate due set hypoxic environment fat cell . Stimulating affected area Quad Rivas Therapy® , focus get vessel back top condition ensure disappearance lipedema SAT . Quad Rivas Therapy® result follow : 1 . Recovery wall vein ; 2 . Increased basal metabolic rate muscle ; 3 . Improved condition connective tissue .</detailed_description>
