	<brief_summary>This randomize controlled trial design test Vagal-gamma amino-butyric acid ( GABA ) Hypothesis one mechanism yoga-based practice improve mood decrease anxiety correct autonomic system ( ANS ) imbalance much activity sympathetic nervous system ( SNS ) little activity parasympathetic nervous system ( PNS ) . This imbalance associate activity GABA system . It hypothesize yoga-based practice increase activity PNS increase respiratory sinus arrhythmia ( RSA ) , associate increased activity GABA system decrease depressive anxiety symptom .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Treatment Depression With Yoga Walking</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects Major Depressive Disorder ( MDD ) randomize two treatment group , yoga group ( YG ) walk group ( WG ) . After screen Scan 1 , subject randomize 12-week yoga walk intervention consist two group session three homework session week.The primary dependent variable brain gamma amino-butyric acid ( GABA ) level measure use magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) two region interest ( ROI ) : thalamus anterior cingulate . GABA level measure three time : Scan 1 prior randomization , Scan 2 12-week intervention , immediately Scan 2 , subject participate either yoga intervention walk intervention , follow immediately Scan 3 . The secondary dependent variable change depressive symptom , mood anxiety measure valid reliable psychological instrument obtain scan screening , week-4 , week-8 week-12 . The third dependent variable respiratory sinus arrhythmia ( RSA ) component heart rate variability ( HRV ) accurately index vagal influence heart . RSA measure scan 1 , pre post intervention session depend group assignment week 4 , 8 12 evaluation , pre post yoga walk intervention Scan 2 3 . Aim 1 : To complete 22 subject yoga group 22 subject walk group total 44 subject Major Depressive Disorder ( MDD ) . Completion define baseline evaluation , week-4 week-8 evaluation week-12 evaluation usable thalamic data Scans 1 , 2 3 . Aim 2 . To measure change GABA level time use mixed linear model analogue repeat measure analysis-of-variance independent group regional GABA level MDD subject assign yoga walk intervention . Aim 3 . To assess change psychological measurement regional GABA level course intervention use linear regression . Aim 4 . To assess change PNS use Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia ( RSA ) course study use linear regression . Aim 5 . To assess change PNS , RSA regional GABA level course study use linear regression .</detailed_description>
