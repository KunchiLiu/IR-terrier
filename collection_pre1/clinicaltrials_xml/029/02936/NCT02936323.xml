	<detailed_description>Protocol PEN-221-001 first enroll patient dose escalation phase , Bayesian logistic regression model , guide escalation overdose control principle overseen safety review committee , use make dose recommendation estimate maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) . Once MTD determine , additional patient enrol early expansion phase confirm adjust MTD . Once MTD confirm , remain patient enrol full expansion phase assess PEN-221 efficacy .</detailed_description>
