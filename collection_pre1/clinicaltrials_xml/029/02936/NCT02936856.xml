	<brief_summary>Primary liver cancer one common malignant tumor lead cause cancer-related death worldwide . Basically therapeutic strategy consider give base stag liver cancer . Thus , confirmatory diagnosis number distribution malignant lesion extreme important . Enhanced CT MRI routinely image scan detect identify lesion . Unfortunately , malignant lesion usually present untypical imaging characteristic , especially among lesion large 1 cm , mislead exact stag liver cancer optimal therapeutic strategy . Basically blood supply malignant liver tumor hepatic artery . Based fact , hepatic arterial digital subtraction angiography could potentially elevate accuracy sensitivity detection malignant lesion number distribution . In study investigator compare number distribution malignant lesion hepatic arteriography , revise stag liver cancer provide good therapeutic strategy .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients primary liver cancer firstly diagnose Affiliated Tumor Hospital Guangxi Medical University November 2015 , clinical diagnostic criterion accord China 's `` primary liver cancer diagnostic treatment practice ( 2011 ) '' . Clinical diagnostic criterion : In solid tumor , hepatocellular carcinoma use clinical diagnostic criterion , recognize domestic foreign country . Combined China 's national condition , history national standard clinical practice , Expert Group establish clinical diagnosis hepatocellular carcinoma request follow condition 1 + 2a 1 + 2b + 3 time satisfy : Patients evidence liver cirrhosis HBV / HCV infection ( HBV / HCV antigen positive ) . Typical imaging feature hepatocellular carcinoma : liver lesion show arterial hypervascularity venous delayed phase washout multidetector CT scan / dynamic contrast enhance MRI . : If liver lesion diameter≥2cm , diagnosis hepatocellular carcinoma make typical imaging feature show one imaging method . b : If liver lesion diameter 1 2cm , diagnosis hepatocellular carcinoma make typical imaging feature show image method . Serum AFP≥400μg/L 1 month ≥200μg/L 2 month , rule cause AFP increase ( pregnancy , reproductive system embryoderived tumor , active liver disease secondary liver cancer , etc. ) . Patients conform China 's `` primary liver cancer diagnostic treatment practice ( 2011 ) '' . Patients allergic Iodinecontaining contrast agent obvious hyperthyroidism . Patients severe cardiovascular disease liver renal insufficiency , tolerate digital subtraction angiography significantly increase risk disease . Patients severe coagulation disorder extreme weak . Patients fever infection puncture site . Patients suffer mental illness cooperate treatment .</criteria>
