	<brief_summary>Suicidal behavior ( SB ) major health problem France:10,000 suicides 220,000 suicide attempt every year . SB management therefore major public health issue . Recently , investigator demonstrate interest acceptance commitment therapy ( ACT ) add-on treatment reduce intensity severity suicidal ideation depress patient history suicide attempt within previous year ( i.e actual SB disorder accord Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders , fifth edition ( DSM-5 ) ) . Based structural functional finding , admit orbitofrontal ventral prefrontal cortex play role suicidal vulnerability . Interestingly , previous functional MRI ( fMRI ) study also report modulation region ACT subject suffer chronic pain . fMRI could thus interest tool identify biomarkers SB improvement ACT . The aim study investigate neural biomarkers ACT efficiency patient SB disorder . Patients history SB within previous year randomize ACT program ( 21 patient ) relaxation program ( 21 patient ) 7 week . Before completion group , perform 3 task fMRI : implicit emotional visualization , Cyberball game , motivational task Investigators compare cerebral activation group , pre post intervention well measure baseline cerebral activation associate improvement suicidal ideation follow .</brief_summary>
