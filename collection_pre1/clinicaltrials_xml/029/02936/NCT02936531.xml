	<detailed_description>Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome ( FXTAS ) progressive , late-onset ( &gt; 50 year ) multisystem neurodegenerative disorder , associate expansion 5Í´untranslated region fragile X mental retardation 1 ( FMR1 ) gene consist 55-200 CGG repeat , term FMR1 gene premutation . While prevalence premutation 1 150-300 female , 1 400-850 male , penetrance FXTAS male carrier ~40 % compare le 20 % female . The mean age onset FXTAS 60 year , present intention tremor , cerebellar ataxia , neuropathic pain , memory and/or executive function deficit , parkinsonism , psychiatric manifestation depression , anxiety and/or apathy . There typical MRI finding FXTAS patient , include increase T2-weighted signal intensity middle cerebellar peduncle , cerebellar cerebral atrophy volume loss corpus callosum . Currently , definitive diagnostic test exist symptomatic condition , FXTAS , FMR1 premutation carrier , make difficult diagnose , particularly early stage disease pathology . ElMindA , Israeli company establish 2006 , focus map neuro-electrophysiological activity , develop novel method map functional network brain activity ( Brain Network Activation BNA ) base analysis evoke response potential ( ERP ) signal . Patients whose underlying disease involve impairment brain circuitry connectivity expect produce abnormal activity templates response paradigm , result fail adhere normal pattern recruit compensatory pathway strategy tackle task . The essence BNA analysis extraction brain activity pattern common group normal subject , brain activity individual subject may compare . Patients FXTAS find exhibit executive memory deficit along altered prefrontal cortex activity functional MRI study investigator suspect patient FXTAS also FMR1 premutation carrier early phase neurodegeneration ( even exhibit overt clinical symptom FXTAS ) may display abnormal BNA pattern . Accordingly , Sheba medical center investigator compute individual BNA score 30 healthy control subject thus define BNA pattern healthy subject use comparison wit study subject . The goal study identify characterize potential neurophysiological biomarker early stage FXTAS disease progression evaluate electrophysiological activity asymptomatic FMR1 Premutation carrier patient various stage ( duration ) FXTAS . Additionally correlation study BNA data demographic ( gender , age disease duration ) . length pathological CGG repeat expansion well FXTAS score , gait posture abnormality ( obtain instrumental time go evaluation ) neuropsychological status . Characterization neuro-electrophysiological biomarkers may important detect early transformation asymptomatic carriership neurodegeneration FXTAS enable early intervention monitor response treatment</detailed_description>
