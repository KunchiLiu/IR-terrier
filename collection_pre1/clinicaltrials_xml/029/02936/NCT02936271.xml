	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate effectiveness Vasculera reduce post procedural pain , bruise edema post procedure period patient diagnose C2-C5 disease require intervention ( ) . The hypothesis Vasculera reduce post procedural pain , bruise edema patient require intervention . This randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled study . Vasculera specially formulate prescription medical food product clinical dietary management metabolic process chronic venous insufficiency . Vasculera limited side effect , please see product insert . A total 110 patient enrol study . Patients randomize receive Vasculera ( Study Product ) placebo .

	<brief_title>Efficacy Vasculera Prevention Post-op Pain Edema Following Lower Extremity Venous Treatment Outpatient Setting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lower extremity venous disease think affect 50 percent woman 40 percent men point lifetime . Many patient seek venous treatment undergo surgical procedure outpatient set . Patient undergo surgical intervention treatment venous reflux disease often experience discomfort , edema discoloration area treatment . These symptom may affect week month procedure . Radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) great saphenous , small saphenous accessory saphenous vein follow sclerotherapy remain tributary vein 1-2 week later common minimally invasive treatment . Both RFA ultrasound guide sclerotherapy cause inflammatory response make post-operative period difficult patient procedure . Vasculara show reduce inflammation , improve vascular tone decrease tissue acidosis . It also show effective treatment post phlebitic syndrome may reduce thrombotic complication . Recent animal data demonstrate decreased postsclerotherapy inflammation rabbit . In anecdotal report provider good result prescribe medication patient take week two prior procedure post-op period , however , evidence practice lack . Vasculara generally safe product limited side effect thus could apply large patient population clear benefit document . Vasculera prescription medical food product compose flavonoid , diosmin proprietary systemic blood alkalinize agent , Alka4-complex . Diosmin use successfully Europe 35 year treatment chronic venous insufficiency complication . There large body publish literature regard molecular activity , clinical efficacy safety diosmin well effect microvasculature show reduce inflammation , improve structural integrity , improve capillary flow reduce capillary leakage serum protein red blood cell . It decrease bradykinin-induced microvascular leakage may act favorably inhibit leukocyte activation , trap , migration . Clinically , edema reduce , ulcer healing accelerate , leukocyte trapping diminish . A similar study similar design study Russian group demonstrate `` feasibility use drug Detralex , brand diosmin market Europe , agent nonspecific pharmacological protection endovascular treatment varicose disease . '' In 2007 DEFANS trial , also Russia conclude , micronized diosmin pre- postoperative period phlebectomy help attenuate pain syndrome , decrease postoperative hematoma accelerate resorption , increase exercise tolerance early postoperative period . Studies perform within United States modern surgical procedure lack .</detailed_description>
