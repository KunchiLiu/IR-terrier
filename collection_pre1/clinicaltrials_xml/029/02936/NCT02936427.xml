	<brief_summary>Post-op analgesia important part early safe patient recovery thoracic surgery . This humane patient outcome reason . Patient outcomes greatly improve optimal pain control complication length stay minimize . Most post-op thoracic complication decrease respiratory effort , failure clear secretion pulmonary infection retain sputum subsequent sequela . Good post-operative analgesia prevents complication also considerably enhance early mobilization thus , decrease hospital stay efficient resource allocation . Early post-operative pain also associate late chronic post thoracotomy pain syndrome debilitate . Pain follow thoracic surgery different standard surgical incision pain due intercostal nerve damage , compression traction injury nerve . This occur incision , rib retraction , compound on-going need respiratory effort . The approach manage pain multi-modal analgesia . The standard regimen stretch preemptive analgesia preoperative placement thoracic epidural post-op opioid infusion . However , non-invasive pharmacology include paracetamol , non steroidal anti inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) , mild moderate opioids well anti-convulsants like pregabalin . However , opioid use well-known side effect include central nervous system ( CNS ) respiratory depression unfortunately delay mobility recovery . This motivated opioid-sparing strategy . The investigator study aim ass whether addition perineural dexamethasone ( steroid ) current practice local anaesthetic wound catheter increase efficacy duration analgesia provide .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Dose Response Dexamethasone Intercostal Blocks With Bupivicaine Post Thoracic Surgery Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent year see importance early mobility respiratory toilet minimise complication hospital stay . Newer method pain relief few systemic effect become even important . Continuous wound infiltration catheter ( CWI 's ) aim deliver local anaesthetic agent directly wound ( 4 ) . This technique go back 1994 , establish hospital use non-structured manner thoracic surgery . Recent study demonstrate addition dexamethasone ( steroid ) local anaesthetic agent similar nerve block significantly improve analgesic affect prolongs duration analgesia . To best investigator knowledge test thoracic surgery cohort patient , though test safely effectively thorax healthy volunteer postoperative analgesia abdominal musculoskeletal post op patient . The investigator aim ass whether addition perineural dexamethasone local anaesthetic CWI 's superior local anaesthetic alone thoracic post operative patient , dose . They also want ass level pain experienced 1 month post op evaluate potential effect dexamethasone post thoracoscopy pain syndrome . The investigator aim compare use local anaesthetic agent combination perineural dexamethasone current practice local anaesthetic alone relieve pain immediate post op pain period . The investigator also want assess whether 8mg dose dexamethasone use similar study optimal dose whether similar effect observe small dose 4mg .</detailed_description>
