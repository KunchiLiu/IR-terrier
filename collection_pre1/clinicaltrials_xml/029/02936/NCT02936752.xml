	<brief_summary>This phase Ib trial study side effect best dose entinostat give together pembrolizumab treat patient myelodysplastic syndrome deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) methyltransferase inhibitor ( DNMTi ) therapy failure . Entinostat may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Monoclonal antibody , pembrolizumab , may interfere ability cancer cell grow spread . Giving entinostat together pembrolizumab may work well treat patient myelodysplastic syndrome DNMTi therapy failure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Entinostat Pembrolizumab Treating Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndrome After DNMTi Therapy Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety , tolerability , identify maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) entinostat give combination pembrolizumab . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To obtain preliminary estimate efficacy entinostat combination pembrolizumab . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess dynamic quantitative change measurable immunological biomarkers ( proportion myeloid-derived suppressor cell [ MDSCs ] , program death protein-1 [ PD-1 ] expression bone marrow ) combine epigenetic-immunotherapy correlation observe clinical response . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study entinostat . Patients receive low dose entinostat orally ( PO ) day 1 8 high dose entinostat PO day 1 , 8 , 15 , pembrolizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 course 2 course thereafter . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve objective response maintain stable disease ( SD ) status first 4 course may continue receive entinostat pembrolizumab 1 year . After completion study treatment , patient follow monthly 6 month .</detailed_description>
