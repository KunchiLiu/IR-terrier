	<brief_summary>That study combine High Frequency Percussive Ventilation ( HFPV ) radiotherapy treatment patient tumor move respiration like breast lung cancer . The use High Frequency Percussive Ventilation system lead cessation respiratory motion administer radiotherapy ( RT ) tumor allow reduction amount irradiate normal tissue potentially decrease radiation-induced collateral damage .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Evaluate Benefit High Frequency Ventilation System During Lung Breast Cancer Radiotherapy Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary objective : Demonstrate clinical benefit HFPV couple thoracic radiotherapy 2 distinct frequent clinical situation : 1 . Tomotherapy lung leave breast tumor . The investigator assume volume irradiate healthy tissue much less use HFPV compare free breathe tomotherapy session . 2 . In comparison Active Breathing Control ( ABC system ) . The investigator assume HFPV lead breathe motion cessation way ABC system , abrogate pause time administrate radiotherapy . This shorten radiotherapy session lung patient treat stereotaxis breast cancer patient .</detailed_description>
