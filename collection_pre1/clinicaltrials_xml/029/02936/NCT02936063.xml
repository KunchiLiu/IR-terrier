	<brief_summary>When patient undergo neck dissection surgery , current standard care close skin layer either metal staple , remove day post-operatively , suture , absorbable remove . To date , conclusive data literature definitively suggest one method well , regard wound complication mature scar cosmesis . Currently , skin closure method choose individual surgeon , base personal preference , factor evaluation wound . The goal study compare two method skin closure , measure outcome investigator look patient satisfaction , wound complication , mature scar cosmesis . The investigator randomize patient undergo head neck surgery receive either staple subcuticular suture , give survey post-operative clinic visit evaluate outcome , determine patient perceive one method superior .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Outcomes Comparing Different Methods Skin Closure Patients Undergoing Head Neck Surgery .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal study evaluate compare patient perception two different method skin closure follow head neck surgery . Currently , standard care include close surgical staple subcuticular suture , decide surgeon 's discretion . Both method use accordance standard care Boston Medical Center , depend individual physician preference . There also factor may influence choice closure time surgery , operative time , wound characteristic . For instance , operative time already extend longer expect , decrease patient anesthesia time , surgeon may opt staple , since fast place suture . Also , although rare scenario , excessive blood loss surgery surgeon reason suspect post-operative hematoma development , likely opt staple closure , facilitate easy post-operative access wound necessary . In literature , incidence hematoma post-operative complication head neck surgery state 3-4.7 % . There various study literature compare two skin closure method general surgery ( abdominal procedure ) obstetrics/gynecological surgery , inconclusive outcome . We find lack data literature describe head neck surgery . Given different type wound , often visible nature result scar , investigator believe value access patient perception skin closure cohort . Kobayashi et al . conduct large randomize control trial 1264 subject , compare staple vs. subcuticular suture open laparoscopic elective colorectal cancer surgery . The result study show significant difference operative outcome ( wound complication , surgical site infection , post-operative length stay , scar esthetic ) . However , staple find shorter operative time , suture result statistically significant high patient satisfaction . A meta-analysis 12 study compare suture staple caesarian section show difference patient satisfaction scar cosmesis , find wound complication staple arm . Much exist data report general surgery obstetrics/gynecology . There lot literature otolaryngology head neck surgery evaluate skin closure method . The importance cosmetic outcome patient satisfaction particularly important field head neck surgery , due visibility scar give location . Upon review exist literature , definitive data support either method superior , regard wind complication outcome , mature scar cosmesis , post-operative pain . There evidence suggest subcuticular suture closure marginally superior regard scar cosmesis , give operative time increase , enough benefit patient change standard care . In addition , current trend medicine move towards patient-reported outcome , become increasingly important evaluate patient satisfaction determine whether superior method . The investigator hypothesize statistically significant difference staple skin closure subcuticular suture closure , regard primary outcome patient satisfaction mature scar cosmesis .</detailed_description>
