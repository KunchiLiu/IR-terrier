	<brief_title>Early-Stage Polycystic Kidney Disease Biomarkers Repository Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In polycystic kidney disease ( PKD ) , renal cyst form utero progressively enlarge due aberrant proliferation cyst-lining cell accumulation fluid within expand cyst cavity . Over decade unrelenting cyst growth , renal function decline due loss functional tissue , eventually lead kidney failure need renal replacement therapy , dialysis kidney transplantation . Effective therapy treatment PKD need deliver early possible , measurable decline kidney function , preserve functional tissue . Currently , difficult make accurate prognosis progression early-stage PKD since growth microscopic cyst difficult detect standard image modality change total kidney volume measure within reasonable time period small informative . Even though early cyst may cause detectable change total kidney volume , progressive enlargement damage surround tissue prelude chronic kidney disease . Current blood urine test provide important information decline kidney function ; however , test useful monitor early event PKD initial cyst growth damage neighbor tissue . Clearly , novel biomarkers early cystic disease need discover develop appropriate clinical test monitor progression early stage PKD . These test important identify patient risk rapid progression need therapeutic intervention monitor effectiveness therapeutic drug . The PKD Biomarkers Repository allow approve researcher obtain blood urine sample biomarker discovery development appropriate biomarker assay prognosis early PKD . This observational study currently recruit three group : 1 ) individual diagnose relatively early PKD define total kidney volume estimate GFR , 2 ) unaffected undiagnosed family member , preferably sibling , 3 ) normal volunteer family history renal disease .</detailed_description>
