	<brief_summary>Percutaneous Coronary Intervention ( PCI ) increasingly effective treat Chronic Total Occlusion ( CTO ) lesion coronary artery . This trial examine modern dissection re-entry approach treat complex CTO lesion Absorb Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold ( BVS ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>DISsection RE-entry Evaluation With Absorb Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffolds CTO .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot study , aim hypothesis generation . This research aim establish feasibility safety treat chronic total occlusion use dissection re-entry technique combination everolimus-eluting bioresorbable vascular scaffold ( Absorb BVS ) . Primary aim study : - To demonstrate low rate Target Vessel Failure ( stent thrombosis , restenosis late closure ) 12 24 month CTO PCI stenting Absorb BVS - To demonstrate high degree endothelial stent strut coverage 12 24 moth CTO PCI stenting Absorb BVSThe primary outcome measure</detailed_description>
