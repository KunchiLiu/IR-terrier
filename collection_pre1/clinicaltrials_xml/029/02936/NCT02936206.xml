	<brief_summary>The purpose study microscopically examine breast cancer cell pre-menopausal woman exposure one two commonly use breast cancer drug , tamoxifen fulvestrant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Examination Breast Cancer Cells Pre-menopausal Women Before After Exposure Tamoxifen Fulvestrant .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The researcher hypothesize cyclinD1-interactome use orient use fulvestrant premenopausal woman . To test hypothesis , researcher propose pre-surgical randomized clinical trial tamoxifen v fulvestrant window breast cancer diagnosis core biopsy definitive surgery . Women ER/cyclinD1 positive tumor eligible . Response tamoxifen fulvestrant evaluate use standard proliferation index well gene expression signature obtain pre-clinical model tamoxifen resistance sensitivity fulvestrant . In addition , researcher propose use cut edge new technology allow ex-vivo expansion primary culture cancer cell obtain fine needle biopsy . The researcher propose compare response primary cell patient response . If successful , impact work could help change standard care young breast cancer patient tamoxifen may detrimental therapy direct fulvestrant , thereby maximize chance long term success endocrine therapy . In addition , may serve proof principle maximize use biopsy material predict treatment response</detailed_description>
