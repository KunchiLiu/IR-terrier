	<detailed_description>Introduction It widely accept insulin resistance MetSyn increase risk cerebrovascular disease ( CVD ) stroke . Additionally , MetSyn associate cognitive impairment increase risk neurodegenerative disease . Despite strong association poor cerebrovascular health MetSyn , cerebral blood flow ( CBF ) response acute insulin surge humans remain largely unexplored . Cerebrovascular dysfunction response insulin potential mechanism ( ) attenuate CBF may highlight central underpinnings pathophysiology stroke CVD , may provide key insight understand cognitive decline strongly link old individual MetSyn . Therefore , establish mechanisms insulin-mediated cerebrovascular control important decrease mortality MetSyn , may profoundly important maintain brain health . Insulin-meditated vasodilation largely vascular endothelium-dependent process . Elegant experiment use animal model suggest insulin resistance disrupts six endothelial signal pathway , strong evidence implicate loss nitric oxide ( NO ) vasodilation , exaggerated endothelin ( ET-1 ) constriction . The literature indicate MetSyn , spike insulin lead vasoconstriction cerebral hypoperfusion . These finding directionally opposite change insulin-mediated vasodilation increase CBF report literature . Evidence suggest uncoupled function nitric oxide synthase ( NOS ) lead unfavorable balance NO , reactive oxygen specie , ET-1 . Normally , stimulation insulin receptor vascular endothelium provide environment NOS manufacture NO lead vasodilation inhibition ET-1 . Instead , MetSyn insulin stimulates vasoconstrictor ET-1 great extent , NOS uncouple generate reactive oxygen specie scavenge NO generate lead great vasoconstrictor signal rather vasodilation . Specific Aims/Study Objectives Specific Aims : The central hypothesis vasodilator action insulin already impaired metabolic syndrome due loss dilator gain constrictor signal . Cerebral vasodilation insulin largely endothelium-dependent . Emerging evidence animal model suggest insulin resistance disrupts least six endothelial signal pathway could potential target , proposal focus two likely reduce CBF MetSyn : 1 ) Loss nitric oxide ( NO ) vasodilation , 2 ) Exaggerated endothelin ( ET-1 ) constriction . These experiment address three specific aim : Aim 1 : To test hypothesis physiologic surge insulin acutely increase CBF young adult , adult MetSyn exhibit paradoxical insulin-mediated vasoconstriction . Aim 2 : To test hypothesis key mechanism responsible poor CBF MetSyn shift NO ET-1 signaling . Specifically , healthy control , NO mediate robust dilation , little ET-1 constriction . In contrast , adult MetSyn exhibit uncouple NO synthase ( NOS ) exaggerate ET-1 constriction . Aim 3 : To test hypothesis insulin regulation CBF regionally distinct ( e.g . MCA reactive ACA basilar ) , negative effect IR similarly regionally specific . Hypotheses : - Adults metabolic syndrome exhibit reduced cerebral vasodilation response OGTT - NOS inhibition reduce CBF response ( Δ CVC/Δ insulin ) lean control level Metabolic syndrome whereas increase CBF responses Metabolic syndrome , suggest Metabolic syndrome uncouple NOS function - ET-1 inhibition increase CBF response ( Δ Cerebral Vascular Conductance Index ( CVCi ) /Δ insulin ) lean control metabolic syndrome . However , increase significantly metabolic syndrome . - The MCA reactive insulin surge cerebral artery Study Endpoints : Change Cerebral vascular conductance ( CVC , ml/min/100mmHg ) relative change concentration insulin blood consumption glucose . Subjects Sixty participant ( 30 per group ) recruit . Determination eligibility two-step process . The first step participant complete initial screen determine qualify screen visit . Preliminary eligible subject invite research lab inform consent formal screening . During screen visit research laboratory , subject complete informed consent , health history questionnaire , MRI Safety screen form , physical activity questionnaire . Height , weight , blood pressure , waist hip circumference also take . Additionally , venous blood sample drawn glucose lipid test determine eligibility . If screening visit reveals abnormality contraindication participation , cover cover summarized exclusion criterion , potential subject allow participate . As summary , subject experience follow activity in-lab screen visit : Methods Following initial screen screen visit , participation study involve two separate MRI study visit ( Saline infusion placebo , versus L-NMMA infusion inhibit NOS OR BQ 123 infusion inhibit ET-1 ) . Subjects direct experimental condition ( placebo/L-NMMA placebo/BQ 123 ) base number subject need maintain statistical power . Once assigned experimental condition group , drug order ( placebo/drug ) perform randomly assign , counter-balanced single blind fashion . The experimental procedure identical test day exception drug infuse . Throughout visit , subject monitor heart rate , blood pressure , end-tidal carbon dioxide , verbal communication adverse symptom ( subject feeling ) MRI scanner . Pregnancy Test : All female subject must negative urine pregnancy test prior either study visit ( placebo drug ) ensure pregnant time study visit . Venipuncture Blood Sample : During screen visit , blood ( 20 ml ) drawn use venipuncture analyze fast glucose , serum lipid . Subjects abstain exercise , caffeine , NSAIDS , well fast ≥ 10 hour prior experimental trial . Intravenous Catheter : Trained staff place two intravenous catheter . Placement catheter arm vein deem suitable ease access . However , one place antecubital fossa ( infusion ) , one antecubital , hand , wrist vein ( blood sample ) opposite arm two study visit . The blood sample IV catheter use draw 15 mL blood sample specific time point throughout study visit measure concentration glucose insulin well marker inflammation oxidative stress . All procedure identical trial ( placebo/L-NMMA/BQ123 ) . The specific time point , approximate due small variation MRI scan time , follow : - Baseline , prior baseline PC VIPR scan - Before PC VIPR scan 1 OGTT - Before PC VIPR scan 2 OGTT - Before PC VIPR scan 3 OGTT - Before PC VIPR scan 4 OGTT - Before PC VIPR scan 5 OGTT - Before PC VIPR scan 6 OGTT - Before PC VIPR scan 7 OGTT - Before PC VIPR scan 8 OGTT - Before PC VIPR scan 9 OGTT Intra-venous infusion : I. NOS inhibition : L - NMMA potent non-selective NOS inhibitor use study vascular physiology . L-NMMA infuse 3 mg/kg body weight/hr bolus ( 10min ) follow maintenance infusion 1 mg/kg/hr duration experiment . Systemic delivery L - NMMA show elevate blood pressure ~8-15 mmHg within range observe exercise . II . ET-1 inhibition : BQ 123 antagonist ETA receptor use research ET-1 signaling diabetes , obesity , hypertension . ETA receptor likely mediate excessive constriction MetSyn patient . Infusion BQ123 take place 0.51 mg/kg/hr ~15 min bolus . Systemic delivery BQ123 show decrease systolic blood pressure 4.5±10 mmHg diastolic 3 ± 7.5 mmHg hypertensive , alter mean arterial pressure obesity . Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) : A 3 Tesla MRI use quantify cerebral blood flow capture cerebral vessel structure designate time point throughout study visit ( baseline treatment condition ) . No contrast agent use time . The subject scanner initial baseline scan experimental trial . All scan accomplished propose timeline experimental trial . While scanner , subject monitor heart rate , ECG , end-tidal carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) , blood pressure . The scanner capability collect data , except end-tidal CO2 , collect subject monitor . In addition standard pulse sequence commonly obtain clinical purpose ( localizers , standard MR Angiography vessel anatomy ( without contrast agent ) , 2D phase contrast MRI velocity encode measurement ) , a.s.o . ; 'basic sequence ' ) , acquisition scheme develop University Wisconsin-Madison use . This scheme , PC VIPR ( phase contrast vastly under-sampled isotropic projection reconstruction ) unique capability acquire volumetric data set three-directional velocity encode high spatial resolution fairly short scan time . All pulse sequence use study design stay within current guideline dB/dt establish FDA . Oral Glucose Tolerance Test ( OGTT ) : The subject drink distil deionized water ( 300ml ) contain 75 gram glucose within 5 minute . This standard administration OGTT . Re-enrollment : Subjects fully complete study choice re-enroll complete wing study participate . Subjects re-screened determine eligibility separate least 1 week completion study . Furthermore , participate L-NMMA BQ 123 ( ever complete wing study ) , need repeat control/saline visit .</detailed_description>
