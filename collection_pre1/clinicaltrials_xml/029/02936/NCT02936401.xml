	<brief_title>Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction Older Adults With HIV Associated Neurocognitive Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study address symptom management patient age 60 old living HIV infection , combination antiretroviral therapy ( cART ) suppress viral load , yet continue experience behavioral cognitive symptom HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder ( HAND ) . It increasingly relevant HAND persist despite cART , impact 30-50 % elder live HIV . Patients suffer symptom pervasive impact everyday functioning quality life ; yet patient currently leave dearth treatment option . In study , investigator employ randomize controlled evaluation Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction ( MBSR ) target attention , stress , anxiety , depressive symptom among patient HAND maximize treatment option . The investigator employ intrinsic connectivity network ( ICN ) analyse rest state functional magnetic resonance image demonstrate increase strength brain network correspond improve symptom . The investigator quantify social network perceive strength social network determine moderate main finding . Together work employ geriatric , neuroscience complementary medicine discipline reduce symptom burden age HIV-infected patient .</detailed_description>
