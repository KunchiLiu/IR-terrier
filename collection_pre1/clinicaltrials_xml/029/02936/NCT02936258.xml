	<brief_summary>The aim study assess efficacy MRI-targeted biopsy compare standard care systematic TRUS guide biopsy detection clinically significant clinically insignificant prostate cancer men without prior biopsy . The implication trial MRI-targeted biopsy could replace systematic TRUS guide biopsy standard care diagnosis prostate cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The standard pathway prostate cancer diagnosis trans-rectal ultrasound guide ( TRUS ) biopsy prostate follow elevate PSA . TRUS guidance perform primarily anatomic guidance ultrasound poorly discriminate cancerous non-cancerous tissue . TRUS guide prostate biopsy concentrate area peripheral zone , think harbor majority cancer . An alternative pathway prostate cancer diagnosis men elevate PSA perform multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging ( MPMRI ) localize cancer . This information use direct subsequent biopsy , know MRI-targeted biopsy . MRI-targeted biopsy show preliminary study detect similar great amount clinically significant cancer systematic TRUS guide biopsy several potential advantage include : ability differentiate clinically significant insignificant cancer , reduce unnecessary biopsy few number biopsy core , reduce biopsy-related side-effects . A 'clinically insignificant cancer ' cancer unlikely progress affect individual 's life expectancy therefore warrant treatment . However diagnose low grade cancer likely insignificant , large proportion subject request treatment case significant cancer present . A challenge area subject typically aware cancer clinically insignificant , often view early diagnosis aggressive treatment subject life-saving . A prostate cancer detection procedure differentiate clinically significant cancer clinically insignificant cancer therefore major unmet need . The potential implication trial include : - A redefinition prostate cancer diagnostic pathway ; - A reduction number subject undergoing prostate biopsy ; - A reduction number biopsy core take per subject ; - A reduction biopsy-related adverse event include sepsis pain ; - A reduction over-diagnosis clinically insignificant prostate cancer ; - A reduction economic burden diagnose treat prostate cancer .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>In order eligible , inclusion criterion must meet : 1 . Men least 18 year age refer clinical suspicion prostate cancer advise prostate biopsy ; 2 . ≥5 % chance highgrade prostate cancer calculate use individualize risk assessment prostate cancer calculator , PCPTRC 2.0 , find http : //deb.uthscsa.edu/URORiskCalc/Pages/calcs.jsp ; 3 . Serum PSA ≤ 20ng/ml within 3 month randomization 4 . Fit undergo procedure list protocol ; 5 . Able provide write informed consent . 1 . Prior prostate biopsy 2 . Prior treatment prostate cancer 3 . Contraindication MRI ( e.g . claustrophobia , pacemaker , estimate GFR ≤ 50mls/min ) 4 . Contraindication prostate biopsy 5 . Men artifact would reduce quality MRI , i.e . previous hip replacement surgery , metallic hip replacement extensive pelvic orthopaedic metal work 6 . Unfit undergo procedure list protocol .</criteria>
