	<detailed_description>Cervical spondylotic myelopathy ( CSM ) frequent cause myelopathy age 50 [ 1 ] . It believe generally progressive course period year , sudden acceleration especially follow slight head neck injury , lead significant disability [ 2 , 3 ] . The treatment CSM remain problem , particularly mild moderate form without rapid progression . Excellent outcomes surgery present many study . All study , however , retrospective , many lack clear design , standard criterion , control group , sufficient follow-up , difficult compare [ 4 , 5 , 6 ] . Furthermore , several study critical review optimistic . They claim surgical treatment myelopathy , especially mild moderate form , show good result conservative treatment long term , criterion indication time operation establish [ 7 , 8 , 9 ] . Twenty-five percent patient laminoplasty suffer severe neck shoulder pain 3 month [ 10 ] , significant morbidity iliac crest donor site etc . Surgery decompress stabilize spine often advocate severe progressive symptom , mixed result . About two-thirds patient improve surgery , whereas surgery successful 15 % 30 % case [ 11 ] . In order get reliable data , long-term follow observational study start confirm effect long term conservative treatment .</detailed_description>
