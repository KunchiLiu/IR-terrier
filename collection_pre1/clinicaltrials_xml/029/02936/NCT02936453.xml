	<brief_summary>STIMO First-in-Man ( FIM ) study confirm safety feasibility closed-loop Epidural Electrical Stimulation ( EES ) combination overground robot assist rehabilitation training patient chronic incomplete spinal cord injury ( SCI ) . Patients participate 9-11 month , - Pre-implant evaluation ( 6-8 week ) - Device implantation stimulation optimization ( 6-8 week ) - Overground rehabilitation training EES ( 5-6 month ) In period implantation , participant need present test training , 4 day per week CHUV University Hospital Lausanne ( lodge provide ) . At end protocol , study aim make patient walk good faster , however , first study kind , success guaranteed .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>STIMO First-in-Man ( FIM ) study objective confirm safety feasibility closed-loop Epidural Electrical Stimulation ( EES ) combination overground robot assist rehabilitation training patient chronic incomplete spinal cord injury ( SCI ) , previously demonstrate successfully animal . The study last 9-11 month individual participant , sign informed consent final test study . The period divide 3 distinct phase : - Pre-implant : 6-8 week inform consent implant . During phase , patient participate total 6 distinct day evaluation , 5 day Lausanne 1 day assessment center Zurich . - Implant stimulation optimization : 6-8 week , include implantation epidural lead neurostimulator . In phase , optimal stimulation parameter determine flex stretch leg . During period , participant need present 4-5 day per week CHUV University Hospital Lausanne ( lodge provide ) . â€¢ Rehabilitation training final evaluation : 4 day per week rehabilitation training period 5 month , follow final evaluation last 4 day Lausanne 1 day Zurich . In phase , patient receive intensive overground rehabilitation training use body weight support device combination EES , aim improve walk capability patient significantly . During period , participant need present 4 day per week CHUV University Hospital Lausanne ( lodge provide ) . At end protocol , study aim make patient walk good faster , quantify pre-defined measure assess prior implant end study . As first study kind , success guarantee , potential benefit outweigh potential risk .</detailed_description>
