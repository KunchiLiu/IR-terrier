	<brief_title>Effectiveness Nanohydroxyapetite Paste Reducing Dentin Hypersensitivity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Following approval Research Ethics Committee Riyadh college Dentistry Pharmacy ( The Institutional Review Board ) , randomize double blind single treatment control clinical trial carry 60 patient ( -- male -- female ) age group 18 45 year , visit out-patient clinic Riyadh Colleges Dentistry Pharmacy period October December . The protocol study develop per guideline design conduct clinical trial dentinal hypersensitivity accordance Declaration Helsinki Guidelines Good Clinical Practice . Prior start study patient give verbal write information process appropriate sign informed consent form obtain . Only subject demonstrate two hypersensitive teeth satisfy tactile airblast hypersensitivity enrolment criterion , qualify participate study . Qualified subject randomly define one three study group order 20 subject per treatment group : - Study 1 : nanoXIM care paste , fluoride-free ( test group ) - Study 2 : fluoride paste - Study 3 : placebo group ( positive control group ) . Subjects select undergo thorough clinical examination , follow oral prophylaxis , oral hygiene instruction dietary counseling . After teeth isolation cotton roll , change dentin sensitivity tactile ( dental explorer ) , thermal stimulus ( drop melt ice ) air stimulus ( blast dental syringe ) evaluate . Following application stimulus , response evaluate assessed Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) . The survey form complete examiner baseline prior paste application first visit . The survey contain five question , rat 10-point scale , assess : 1 . Degree pain . 2 . Duration pain . 3 . Intensity pain . 4 . Tolerability pain . 5 . Description pain . Data Analysis The study patient randomly assign 3 group ( N , F P ) equal group 20 . The randomization process make use computer-generated random table . Excel software ( Micro- soft ) use randomization . The paste use study label N , F P respectively , completely wrap allow paste applicant member research team know test paste apply patient . The patient blind let know agent apply . The chief investigator , first author study , coordinate entire trial recruit various operator .</detailed_description>
