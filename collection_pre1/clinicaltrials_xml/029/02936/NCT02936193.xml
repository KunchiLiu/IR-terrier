	<brief_summary>The safety efficacy Laparoscopy-assisted Pylorus-preserving Gastrectomy ( LAPPG ) treatment early gastric cancer ( EGC ) remain controversial . The investigator conduct randomize control trial compare LAPPG laparoscopic distal gastrectomy D2 lymph node dissection EGC .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Laparoscopy-assisted Pylorus-vagus Nerve Preserving Gastrectomy Treatment Early Gastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During procedure , distal part stomach resect , pyloric cuff 2-3 cm wide preserve . The right gastric artery infrapyloric artery preserve maintain blood supply pyloric cuff . In addition , hepatic pyloric branch vagal nerve preserve maintain pyloric function . The celiac branch posterior vagal trunk sometimes preserve . All regional node except suprapyloric node ( No . 5 ) dissect standard D2 procedure . However , technical challenge associate complete procedures.The five-year survival rate PPG modify D2 lymph node dissection range 95 % 98 % . This rate comparable five-year survival rate gastric resection EGC , range 90 % 98 % . In term oncologic safety , PPG seem reasonably safe EGC accuracy preoperative diagnosis assure</detailed_description>
