	<brief_summary>The cost related management heart failure significant , respect financial cost suffer patient . Still much 50 % heart failure patient readmitted within 6 month hospitalization decompensated heart failure . Specialized nurse grow role diagnostics follow-up outpatient HF patient , add ultrasound diagnostics nurse consultation may improve care . In heart failure patient use ultrasound tool assess volume status guidance diuretic therapy promising . Aim study evaluate feasibility reliability echocardiographic acquisition heart failure nurse assess cardiac function index assess volume status outpatient heart failure clinic combine telemedicine approach near real-time interpretation recording cardiologist specialized echocardiography heart failure remote location .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Telemedicine Ultrasound Support Nurse-based Outpatient Heart Failure Clinic</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The worsen heart failure epidemic significant driver health care expenditure increase cost , lose productivity increase suffer patient . Thus , important develop strategy improve heart failure care reduce hospital readmission . Some progress heart failure management make new drug therapy remote monitor patient heart failure . This project aim provide data may add exist literature regard use telemedicine safe transfer ultrasound data relatively inexperienced user qualitative quantitative interpretation expert different location . The author study whether diffusion focus cardiac ultrasound outpatient heart failure clinic support cardiologist provide telemedicine feasible provide reliable data . Firstly , investigator study use high-end ultrasound machine connect wire broadband network CE-classified software provide safety anonymization transfer data . This project could significant importance support widen use ultrasound diagnostics , even expert location health-care provider perform ultrasound acquisition . For patient may allow good faster diagnostics , thus treatment . For health-care system may improve quality diagnostics therapy , cost-saving well . Lastly , could make way innovation improve diagnostics thus therapy . Aims 1 . To study feasibility implement focus echocardiography ultrasound examination assess volume status heart failure clinic caregiving nurse acquire ultrasound image access near real-time interpretation cardiologist telemedicine . 2 . To study reliability measurement cardiac size function index ultrasound recording acquire heart failure nurse , provide another location interpretation cardiologist telemedicine , comparison reference imaging . 3 . To study clinical influence implement ultrasound examination perform nurse assess volume status cardiac function outpatient heart failure clinic support collaboration specialist available telemedicine .</detailed_description>
