	<detailed_description>Diabetic neuropathy ( DN ) common chronic complication diabetes , affect to50 % individual type 1 diabetes ( T1DM ) . DN progressive disease , lead severe morbidity stagger health care cost . Patients experience poor quality life due pain , loss sensation lead poor balance , fall eventual foot deformity high rate ulceration amputation . While commonly diagnose DN , cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy ( CAN ) carry equal morbidity patient experience orthostasis , arrhythmias premature death ) . Despite high morbidity associate DN , randomize clinical trial evaluate therapy establish DN disappoint . To date pathogenetic treatment condition . The Diabetes Control Complications Trial ( DCCT ) demonstrate intensive control design achieve near-normal glycemia essential reduce risk DN development type 1 diabetes ( 8 , 9 ) . However , attainable intensive glycemic control , although necessary , insufficient prevent adverse nervous system effect , justify therapeutic need identify new drug target treat DN early course . One new therapeutic target inflammation . Multiple pre-clinical clinical study demonstrate pathogenic role inflammation , especially cytokine production , disease course DN CAN . This suggest agent know anti-inflammatory property , salicylate , may prevent development DN pain associate DN . Salsalate , pro-drug form salicylate , FDA approve drug commonly indicate relief sign symptom rheumatoid arthritis , osteoarthritis relate rheumatic disorder . In vitro vivo study human trial show salicylate therapy effective control low grade inflammation diabetes inhibition inhibitor κB kinase ( IKKβ ) /NF-κB pathway . It large margin safety ( unlike salicylate ) , low cost . There also extensive experience long-term human use salsalate . Several study show salsalate cause great intestinal occult blood loss placebo suppressive effect renal prostaglandin production contrast aspirin NSAIDs . The recently publish NIDDK-funded `` Targeting Inflammation Using Salsalate Type 2 Diabetes ( TINSAL-T2D ) '' trial confirm salutary effect 3.5 gram/day salsalate marker inflammation , glucose control overall safety 48 week patient type 2 diabetes . The Investigators ' initial NIDDK fund R03 ( DK 094499 ) grant confirm safety feasibility target inflammation salsalate treatment T1DM subject DN . The Investigators ' current study build upon expands initial promising result either confirm refute therapeutic efficacy salsalate large T1DM cohort .</detailed_description>
