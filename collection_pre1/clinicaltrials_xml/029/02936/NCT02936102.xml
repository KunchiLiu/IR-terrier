	<brief_summary>The purpose `` first-in-human '' study FAZ053 characterize safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) , pharmacodynamics ( PD ) antitumor activity FAZ053 administer Intravenously ( i.v . ) single agent combination PDR001 adult patient advance solid tumor . By block interaction Programmed Death Ligand-1 ( PD-L1 ) receptor , Programmed Death-1 ( PD-1 ) B7.1 , FAZ053 inhibit PD-L1 immune checkpoint , result activation antitumor immune response activate effector T-cells inhibit regulatory T-cells . This study design Phase I , open-label , multi-center study dose escalation part FAZ053 single agent combination PDR001 , follow dose expansion part FAZ053 single agent combination PDR001 . FAZ053 initially dose every three week . A less frequent dose regimen every 6 week may evaluate parallel . A patient may continue treatment FAZ053 single agent combination PDR001 patient experience unacceptable toxicity , confirm disease progression per immune relate Response Criteria and/or treatment discontinue discretion investigator patient .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Written inform consent prior procedure . Dose escalation cohort FAZ053 single agent FAZ053 combination PDR001 : Patients advanced/metastatic solid tumor measurable nonmeasurable disease determine Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) version 1.1 may may receive prior treatment immune checkpoint inhibitor , progress despite standard therapy , standard therapy available . Dose expansion group FAZ053 single agent FAZ053 combination PDR001 : Patients advanced/metastatic solid tumor least one measurable lesion determine RECIST version 1.1 may may receive prior treatment immune checkpoint inhibitor ( FAZ053 single agent treatment antiPDL1 inhibitor permit ) , progress despite standard therapy , standard therapy available fit one follow group : FAZ053 single agent : NSCLC/ TNBC/ Endometrial cancer / Anaplastic thyroid cancer/Selected indication ( ) dose expansion group every 6 Weeks ( Q6W ) dose regimen FAZ053 combination PDR001 : NSCLC/TNBC / Selected indication ( ) dose expansion group Q6W dose regimen Performance Status ( PS ) ≤ 2 : Patient must site disease amenable biopsy candidate tumor biopsy accord treat institution 's guideline . Patient must willing undergo new tumor biopsy screening/ baseline molecular prescreening applicable , therapy study . Presence symptomatic central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases CNS metastasis require local CNSdirected therapy ( e.g . radiotherapy surgery ) increase dos corticosteroid within prior 2 week . Patients treat brain metastasis neurologically stable ( 4 week posttreatment prior study enrollment ) steroids least 2 week administration study treatment . History severe hypersensitivity study treatment excipients additives monoclonal antibody ( mAbs ) and/or excipients . Active , know suspected autoimmune disease . Patients vitiligo , residual hypothyroidism require hormone replacement , psoriasis require systemic treatment condition expect recur absence external trigger exclude . Patients previously expose antiPD1/PDL1 treatment adequately treat skin rash replacement therapy endocrinopathies exclude . Treatment cytotoxic target antineoplastic within 3 week initiation study treatment . For cytotoxic agent major delay toxicity washout period one cycle indicate ( example nitrosoureas mitomycin C typically require 6 week washout ) . Prior antibody immunotherapy require 6 week washout . Patients receive systemic chronic steroid therapy immunosuppressive therapy ( ≥ 10mg/day prednisone equivalent ) . Topical , inhale , nasal ophthalmic steroid allow . Active infection require systemic antibiotic therapy . Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criterion may apply .</criteria>
