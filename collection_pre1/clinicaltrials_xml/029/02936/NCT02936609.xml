	<detailed_description>Cancer morbidity mortality greatly reduce screen prevention , uninsured patient much less likely insured patient receive evidence-based service recommend . In addition , uninsured cancer survivor receive few primary preventive care service health insurance . Thus , hypothesize Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) Medicaid expansion could substantially improve access essential cancer preventive screening service previously uninsured patient , facilitate good care cancer survivor gain health insurance . In 2012 , United States ( US ) Supreme Court rule state legally require implement ACA Medicaid expansion , create unique natural experiment test hypothesis . By April 1 , 2015 , 30 state District Columbia implement expansion , 20 state . This lead increase Medicaid enrollment 26 % expansion state , compare 8 % non-expansion state . Previous single-state Medicaid expansion lead increase utilization healthcare service improve health outcome post-expansion . For example , Oregon , cervical cancer screen rate 18-19 % high among woman gain Medicaid 2008 , compare remain uninsured . However , previous assessment state-specific expansion concurrent control ( non-expansion ) state comparison . Further , little know Medicaid expansion impact delivery recommend primary preventive care service cancer survivor , term 'survivor care . ' The investigator propose use ACA Medicaid expansion natural experiment study effect state-level Medicaid expansion rate cancer screen preventive service ( 'cancer prevention ' ) survivor care . Many patient likely gain coverage ACA Medicaid expansion receive primary care community health center ( CHCs ) , nation 's healthcare 'safety net ; ' thus , propose analysis use electronic health record ( EHR ) data ADVANCE clinical data research network ( CDRN ) CHCs ( ADVANCE one 11 CDRNs national PCORnet data network ) . The ADVANCE CDRN patient-level data 476 CHCs 13 Medicaid expansion state ( n=576,711 patient ) 242 CHCs 8 non-expansion state ( n=361,421 patient ) . This nationally unique data resource allow u measure outcomes expansion versus non-expansion state , illuminate impact increase Medicaid opportunity rate cancer prevention survivor care within safety net . The investigator also assess whether disparity delivery care reduce . Our specific aim study , title `` Assessing Community Cancer care insurance ExpanSionS ( ACCESS ) , '' : Aim 1 . Compare pre-post receipt cancer prevention screen among vulnerable CHC patient Medicaid expansion versus non-expansion state . Hypothesis 1a : Cancer prevention screen significantly increase among CHC patient expansion state , compare non-expansion state . Hypothesis 1b : Racial/ethnic disparity cancer prevention screen significantly reduce expansion state versus change non-expansion state . Aim 2 . Compare pre-post insurance status , visit , receipt routine , recommend primary preventive care among cancer survivor see CHCs expansion versus non-expansion state . Hypothesis 2a : A high percentage uninsured cancer survivor gain insurance coverage expansion state , compare non-expansion state . Hypothesis 2b : Cancer survivor CHC patient expansion state significant increase visit , visit pay Medicaid , survivor care relative change among patient non-expansion state .</detailed_description>
