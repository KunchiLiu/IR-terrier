	<detailed_description>Sequential Blood Loss : Blood loss simulate withdrawal 20 % estimate total blood volume . Estimated total blood volume men = 75 mL/kg woman = 65 mL/kg . The calculated target withdrawal volume also consistent allowable estimate blood loss equation assume start hematocrit ( hct ) approximately 45 % male 40 % female , expect drop hct volume withdraw 7 percentage point males 6 percentage point female . An actual drop hct may observe study due relatively expedient removal blood simultaneous administration fluid ( i.e. , `` hemodilution '' crystalloid ) . Blood remove aliquot ~333 mL . For safety , men 4 unit blood remove ( 1,333 mL ) woman 3 unit blood remove ( 1,000 mL ) . The blood withdrawn via venous catheter anticipate take 15-20 min stage blood withdrawal occur . A total 3 aliquot withdraw approximately sixty minute woman 4 aliquot withdraw 80 minute men . The blood store use preservative anticoagulation procedure similar use perioperative hemodilution and/or intraoperative cell saver . The blood remain study room re-infused . We use standard `` auto-transfusion '' blood collection equipment identical use ORs perioperative hemodilution technique . The blood drain gravity indwell vascular catheter anti-coagulant preservative solution use tube bag system provide autologous transfusion team routinely work ORs . For first several study schedule time auto-transfusion OR personnel present anesthesiologist directly involve draw blood , subsequent handle reinfusion . The blood never leave autologous transfusion bag close system use . The blood hold room temp gentle agitation ~60-80 minute re-infused 60-80 minute via large bore IV ; monitor continue reinfusion . Following completion reinfusion subject de-instrumented observed physiology lab two hour .</detailed_description>
