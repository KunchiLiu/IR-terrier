	<brief_summary>Recently low-volume polyethylene glycol contain ascorbic acid ( PEG-Asc ) formulation proven safe effective traditional 4-L PEG solution colonoscopy preparation . However , currently available aqueous purgative formulation poorly tolerate . The aim study compare split-dose 2-L PEG-Asc 1-L PEG-Asc bisacodyl ( 10 mg ) formulation determine quality bowel cleanse patient tolerability .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Low Volume PEG-Asc Lower Volume PEG-Asc With Bisacodyl</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Study design A single center , randomize , comparative observer-blinded study perform May 2015 September 2015 Department Gastroenterology Digestive Endoscopy Korea University Anam Hospital ( Seoul , Korea ) . In total , 200 outpatient receive low volume 1-L PEG ascorbic acid plus bisacodyl ( 1L-PEG/AB ) low volume 2-L PEG ascorbic acid ( 2L-PEG/A ) 1:1 ratio . At time registration , subject randomly allocate either group . They randomize computer-generated list provide write instruction . All patient provide write informed consent . - Patients All patient age 20 75 year . Patients exclude analysis know suspected gastrointestinal obstruction , Ileus , severe heart failure , uncontrolled hypertension ( systolic pressure &gt; 170 mmHg , diastolic pressure &gt; 100 mmHg ) , severe constipation , clinically significant electrolyte abnormality , prior bowel resection , significant gastroparesis . - Bowel preparation In 2L-PEG/A group , 1 L PEG contain ascorbic acid take 8:00 pm day colonoscopy , follow extra 500 mL water . The second 1-L PEG contain ascorbic acid take 4 h colonoscopy examination , additional 500 mL water . Each liter preparation extra 500 mL water consume within 2 h procedure . The 1L-PEG/AB group receive 10 mg bisacodyl 9:00 pm day colonoscopy . Four hour colonoscopy examination , 1 L PEG contain ascorbic acid take , follow additional 1 L water . The preparation complete 2 h examination . All colonoscopy perform 9 1 pm . - Assessment endoscopists Colonoscopies perform two expert endoscopists blind preparation regimen . These two endoscopists work 5 year institution . Bowel cleanse scored endoscopist perform colonoscopy . To assess cleanse quality bowel preparation , Boston Bowel Preparation Scale ( BBPS ) Aronchick Bowel Preparation Scale ( ABPS ) use . - Assessment patient tolerability adverse event Before colonoscopy procedure , patient complete questionnaire symptom associated preparation assess tolerability . Patients ask assess degree abdominal fullness , abdominal pain , nausea , vomit , sleep disturbance , general discomfort use 5-point scale ( i.e. , none , mild , moderate , severe , severe ) . The palatability preparation grade 5 category : good , good , acceptable , disgust , bad . - Sample size statistical analysis A sample size least 89 patient group require treatment group detect difference treatment success 5 % type-I error rate 80 % power two-tailed χ2 test . Our sample size base result pilot study conduct hospital include 35 patient group . It estimate efficacy excellent treatment success would 49 % PEG-2L/A 30 % PEG-1L/AB . Based data , decide collect 100 patient per treatment group study . Continuous variable express mean ± standard deviation ( SD ) , discontinuous variable express count percentage . SPSS 20.0 Windows ( SPSS Inc. , Chicago , IL , US ) use data entry statistical analysis . For analysis two treatment group , Students t-test appropriate use compare continuous variable either Chi-square Fisher 's exact test use categorical data . The p-values &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant .</detailed_description>
