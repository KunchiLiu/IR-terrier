	<brief_title>The Use Integra Coverage Radial Forearm Free Flap Donor Site Defect</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The radial forearm fasciocutaneous free flap ( hereafter refer RFFF ) describe 30 year ago fasciocutaneous flap microsurgical transfer . It soon establish safe reliable flap transfer fascia cutaneous tissue . Currently , use repair defect relatively thin island skin need fascial strength layer . While flap reliable , leave donor site unsightly multiple known complication include loss pronation , pain , paresthesia , cold intolerance , skin graft necrosis . The donor site typically cover split thickness skin graft ( hereafter refer STSG ) . In effort minimize complication , several group describe technique place Integra© dermal substitute ( hereafter refer Integra ) underneath STSG provide thicker support decrease overall morbidity associate defect . These study show success decrease overall morbidity include increase range motion improve aesthetic quality donor site . However , large study date include 29 subject . Furthermore , study provide comparative cohort subject repair classic STSG show effectiveness technique compare classic repair . Our goal perform prospective study compare subject repair classic STSG repair one step Integra STSG apply time . These subject evaluate overall donor site aesthetic quality functional outcome described .</detailed_description>
