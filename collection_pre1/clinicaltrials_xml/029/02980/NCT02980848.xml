	<brief_title>Assessing Breast Density 's Value Imaging - A Comparative Effectiveness Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aim 1 : Compare effectiveness breast cancer screen use digital mammography alone versus digital mammography plus supplemental screening ( digital breast tomosynthesis MRI ) extent breast density . Sub aim 1 : Evaluate whether performance tomosynthesis improve year experience , whether `` learn curve '' depend radiologist specialty ( i.e. , breast image specialist vs. general radiologist ) . Aim 2 : Compare effectiveness preoperative MRI versus MRI extent breast density among woman initial , pathologically confirm diagnosis DCIS invasive breast cancer .</detailed_description>
