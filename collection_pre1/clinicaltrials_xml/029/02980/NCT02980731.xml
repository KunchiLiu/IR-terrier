	<brief_summary>The purpose open-label , single-arm study evaluate impact venetoclax quality life participant chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ; type cancer affect blood bone marrow ) include 17p deletion TP53 mutation ( local lab assess ) OR CLL participant receive prior B-Cell Receptor Inhibitor ( BCRi ) therapy . The start dose venetoclax 20 mg daily . The dose must gradually increased period 5 week daily dose 400 mg . Participants may continue receive venetoclax 2 year . After treatment period , participant may continue 2-year follow-up period .</brief_summary>
