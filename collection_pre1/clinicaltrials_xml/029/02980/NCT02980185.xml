	<brief_title>Laparoscopy Primary Cytoreductive Surgery Advanced Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patient presume stage III-IV ovarian cancer clinical condition allow aggressive surgery candidate possible primary cytoreduction aim achieve residual tumor=0 . A definite protocol adopt : radiological preoperative evaluation PET-CT scan , patient underwent laparoscopic evaluation Fagotti score . Once consider suitable primary debulking surgery , possibility attempt laparoscopic cytoreduction carefully evaluate use strict selection criterion ; patient divide two group , base type surgical approach . At end laparoscopic primary cytoreduction , ultra-low pubic minilaparotomy perform extract surgical specimen perform laparoscopic hand-assisted exploration abdominal organ , order ensure complete excision disease . Surgical data , optimal cytoreduction ( define residual tumor=0 ) rate survival outcomes investigate .</detailed_description>
