	<detailed_description>The increase prevalence eat disorder adolescence frequent chronic course lead development various program prevention , early detection early intervention . Nevertheless , cause anorexia nervosa ( AN ) bulimia nervosa ( BN ) remain topic much discussion research . Evidence point multifactorial disease pattern intrapsychic , psychosocial biological factor interact reinforce one another . Eating disorder increasingly associate sign emotional psychological disturbance . In clinical population , personality trait observe exacerbate factor constitute important variable differentiation . While investigation show high comorbidity personality disorder eat disorder adulthood , comparable study adolescence yet undertake . The propose study investigate whether , basis personality traits personality disorder well specific cerebral activation pattern , differentiation identify among adolescent female patient AN ( n = 50 ) BN ( n = 30 ) comparison healthy control group ( n = 30 ) . Of particular interest potential connection specific personality traits neural correlate two ED : 1 . Do specific personality trait personality disorder correlate significantly particular type ED ? 2 . Do AN BN correlate significantly particular cerebral activation pattern follow visual presentation food stimulus gustatory stimulus ? 3 . Can connection identify specific personality profile cerebral activation pattern AN BN ? 4 . Will change cerebral activation pattern evident begin treatment ( T1 ) end treatment ( T2 ) ? The study use specific questionnaire deal eat behavior ( EDI &amp; EAT ) well clinical interview assessment personality disorder ( SCID II ) . Cerebral processing evaluate use functional MRI ( fMRI ) structural MRI . fMRI result visual gustatory stimulus correlate structural brain morphology MRI psychopathological parameter . The correlation clinical value represent new approach investigation eat disorder adult may significant relevance data interpretation understand cerebral change due anorexia . MRI measurement perform begin therapy ( T1 ) end therapy ( T2 ) . In fashion , know risk factor supplement information specific personality traits cerebral activation pattern . The propose study thus provide important new insight early detection , prevention , treatment clinical assessment .</detailed_description>
