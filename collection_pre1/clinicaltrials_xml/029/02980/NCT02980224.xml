	<detailed_description>Inflammation key component dry eye disease . Increasing systemic level omega-3 fatty acid relative omega-6 level mediate immune response . Evaluating whether omega-3 supplementation improve dry eye disease sign , symptom associate measure inflammation may present new therapeutic option dry eye disease . The primary objective study evaluate safety efficacy twice daily ( BID ) dose OmegaD softgels subject dry eye disease . Male female subject 18 year 90 year age , patient-reported dry eye symptom clinical diagnosis dry eye disease support global clinical assessment screen enrol . Each subject must , least one eye , tear osmolarity ≥ 312 mOsm/L meibomian gland dysfunction define grade 1 2 meibomian orifice size scale Screening Baseline least one eye . In addition , Tear break time ( TBUT ) must ≤ 7 second eye Screening Baseline Schirmer 's test score eye ( ) must ≥ 5 mm Baseline .
