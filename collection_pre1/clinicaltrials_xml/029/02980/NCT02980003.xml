	<detailed_description>Contrast medium-induced nephropathy ( CIN ) recognize complication coronary diagnostic interventional procedure , associate prolonged hospitalization adverse clinical outcome . The frequency CIN range 2 % low-risk patient 50 % high-risk patient . The important risk factor CIN development pre-existing renal failure , diabetes , age , volume type contrast medium . There two main pathogenetic mechanism postulate cause CIN : 1. direct toxic action contrast medium kidney tubule cell , cause disruption mitochondrial function , generation reactive oxygen specie , subsequent cell injury apoptosis ; 2. vasoconstriction , reduce blood flow renal medulla cause ischemia cell damage The treatment CIN exclusively supportive . Treatment particularly recommend patient chronic kidney disease ( CKD - mild , moderate severe , accord estimate glomerular filtration rate - eGFR ) . Several approach test prevention CIN variable success . Adequate hydration widely accept best method prevention CIN , today strategy generally accept international guideline ( class recommendation I , level evidence A ) . The use N-acetyl cysteine , recommend even recent past , support recent randomized trial14 meta-analysis . Hemodialysis hemofiltration may effective preventive CIN , reserve high-risk patient . Attempts prevent CIN various medication , furosemide , vitamin C , statins numerous , largely unsuccessful . The efficacy bicarbonate prevention CIN extensively test ; rationale urine alkalinization suppresses formation free radical . Actually , study bicarbonate controversial , vary beneficial toxic effect ; could bring question role alkalinize procedure prevent CIN . Nevertheless , favorable result prevention protocols use bicarbonate note study also document significant alkalinization urine ; similar protocol prove effective dose bicarbonate insufficient aim . Moreover , Markota et al. , recent study patient estimate eGFR &gt; 15 mL/min/1.73 m2 schedule coronary angiography , document Na/K citrate significantly reduce incidence CIN compare hydration alone , show patient urine pH &lt; 6 ten-fold high incidence CIN compare patient whose urine pH &gt; 6.28 These result confirm potential role urine alkalinization prevent CIN place oral administration alkalinize drug attractive method compare complex , always effective , i.v . infusion bicarbonate . Finally , oral dos bicarbonate may sufficient alkalinize urine thus prevent CIN . In study recently publish , oral dose 4 g sufficient obtain , two hour administration , adequate urinary alkalinization pH &gt; 7 participant without side effect . This value maintain even magnify nearly 8 hour last dose . Interestingly , Authors observe additive effect second dose , show nondepleting urine pH , despite report short half-life sodium bicarbonate . Against background , investigator test hypothesis oral i.v . bicarbonate adequate strategy CIN prevention patient coronary angiography . Comparing incidence CIN accord urine pH achieve immediately angiography , investigator aim demonstrate urine alkalinization real goal , result largely independent strategy adopt achieve . The investigator therefore compare efficacy alkalinize urine prevent CIN three different strategy : hydration alone ; hydration plus i.v . sodium bicarbonate ; hydration plus oral bicarbonate . Favorable result bicarbonate group compare control group could increase evidence support use alkalinize strategy prevent CIN ; time , non-inferiority result oral group compare i.v . bicarbonate group could suggest practical oral administration prefer prevention strategy .</detailed_description>
