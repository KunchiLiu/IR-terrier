	<brief_title>Pemetrexed Platinum Use Neoadjuvant Setting Resectable Stage II IIIA Lung Adenocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study prospective , single-center , open-label , single-armed , phase II clinical trial . Clinical staging determine accord routine protocol , include enhance chest CT scan , brain MRI CT , bone scintigraphy , abdominal ultrasonography cardiopulmonary test . PET/CT scan optional . Preoperative diagnosis lymph node metastasis perform use enhanced chest CT PET/CT . Preoperative pathological diagnosis confirm electronic fiber bronchoscopic biopsy , CT-guided percutaneous lung puncture biopsy endobronchial ultrasonography （EBUS/EUS） necessary . Patients go receive two cycle pemetrexed 500mg/m2 day 1 cisplatin 75mg/m2 day 1 ( 25mg/m2 day 1-3 ) , 21 day per cycle . Treatment cycle repeat every 21 day . Following two cycle chemotherapy , radiological examination baseline chest CT PET/CT scan repeat tumor response evaluation . Radiographic response record Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors （RECIST 1.1） . Patients undergo complete resection 2 6weeks follow last dose chemotherapy . The surgical extent leave discretion general thoracic surgeon . And lobectomy pneumonectomy mediastinal lymph node dissection recommend . Two cycle post-surgery pemetrexed/cisplatin treatment administrate subsequently . The primary objective determine radiological response rate ( RR ) 2 cycle neoadjuvant chemotherapy pemetrexed cisplatin patient resectable stage II IIIA lung adenocarcinoma . The radiological response rate measure 3 4 week second cycle chemotherapy accord RECIST criterion 1.1 . The secondary objective determine pathological response rate , safety , clinical feasibility rate , drug delivery , 2-year disease free survival ( DFS ) 2-year overall survival ( OS ) .The pathological response rate investigate determination type extent vital tumor tissue tumor necroses well reactive alteration foam cell reaction fibrosis scar formation light microscopic evaluation surgical resection specimen stain H &amp; E.The clinical feasibility achieve 1 ) death due cancer , toxicity comorbidity , 2 ) toxicity event include Grade 4 neutropenia &gt; 7 day ; febrile grade 3/4 neutropenia ; grade 4 thrombocytopenia &gt; 7 day grade bleeding ; grade 3/4 nonhematologic toxicity relate chemotherapy ( except nausea/vomiting/hair loss ) observe . The drug delivery define accomplishment chemotherapy.DFS measure date operation date first progression recurrence . OS measure date operation date death NSCLC date last see alive .</detailed_description>
