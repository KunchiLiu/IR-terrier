	<brief_summary>Awareness sense smell western population low . Most people think consequence absence smell ( anosmia ) . Reduction sense smell ( hyposmia ) influence everyday life . In situation stress anosmia life threaten example fire . Cooks may lose job . Not able enjoy food drink interfere quality life . The cause olfactory dysfunction ( OD ) vary . Most often OD associate upper respiratory tract infection , disease nose sinus head injury . OD may congenital , age relate associated neurological disorder . Hyposmia occur 85 % case Parkinson 's may first symptom Parkinson 's Alzheimer 's disease several year mental change occur . Knowledge focus OD recently low among physician treatment option often available . Different approach improve OD try variable effect depend cause OD . There study corticosteroid , zinc gluconate vitamin A . In recent year , olfactory training launch promise treatment option . Most study olfactory train do patient OD . A recently publish review describe 10 study olfactory training among 639 patient concludes daily stimulation odorants ( odor concentrate ) limit period time promising treatment . The suggested duration olfactory training vary 3 14 month . Different intensities olfactory training compare patient post-viral OD . Olfaction improve high concentration odorant low concentration . A small number study show olfactory nerve extent train person normal sense smell , need experience structure study able conclude great certainty effect olfactory training population . This study examine whether intensive olfactory training improve sense smell ordinary olfactory training subject normal olfaction ( normosmia ) examine self-evaluation olfactory function .</brief_summary>
