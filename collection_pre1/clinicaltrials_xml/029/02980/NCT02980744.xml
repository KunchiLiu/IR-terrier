	<brief_summary>The traditional approach physical activity promotion people stroke always emphasize activity moderate-to-vigorous intensity ( i.e . move enough breathe fast break sweat ) . For many people stroke often difficulty walk , achieve intensity activity difficult . The result people stroke spend 80 % day sedentary behaviour ( much sitting ) . A grow body research show much sit negative effect health include large waist circumference , unhealthy level blood glucose insulin , heart disease , low level function , premature death . This project test new approach activity promotion focus increase light-intensity activity throughout whole day reduce sit time . The new intervention title `` STand Up Frequently From Stroke ( STUFFS ) '' aim increase self-confidence among people stroke sit less , stand walk around frequent interval day . Studies general population show stand walk around frequently beneficially associate health indicator ( low waist circumference , low blood fat glucose level ) . Encouraging people stroke reduce sit increase light-intensity activity appear feasible sustainable might first step increase daily energy expenditure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Home-based Intervention Reduce Sedentary Behaviour Improve Function After Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Stroke lead cause adult disability among Canadians , 405,000 individual live effect stroke number expect rise 80 % next 20 year [ 1 ] . Guidelines activity promotion people stroke emphasize attainment 150 minute moderate-to-vigorous intensity activity per week [ 2 ] . Moving fast enough 'break sweat ' challenge people stroke often mobility deficit . Stroke survivor spend 80 % day sedentary behaviour ( much sitting ) [ 3-5 ] . Accumulating evidence indicate sedentary behaviour deleterious effect health , regardless exercise level [ 6 ] . Targeting sedentary behaviour might feasible sustainable way change activity behaviour people stroke . Purpose : This research aim test feasibility social cognitive theory-based intervention reduce sedentary behaviour improve light-intensity activity ( stand walk around frequently ) . The focus improve activity behaviour allow systematic stag reduction contact organise hospital care . Methodological approach : Thirty-five person stroke enrol . Outcomes include sedentary behaviour , physical activity function measure baseline ( week 0 ) , post-intervention ( week 9 ) follow-up ( week 16 ) . Activity behaviour ( i.e . time sedentary , stand , step ) record 7 day time point use activPAL activity monitor , validated people stroke [ 7 ] . Impairment stroke assess use Chedoke McMaster Stroke Assessment , valid reliable tool measure impairment stroke [ 8 ] . Cognitive status assess use Montreal Cognitive Assessment scale , validate stroke [ 9 ] . At end intervention , feasibility outcome reach ( number enrol / number eligible ) , retention ( % enrol complete study ) , satisfaction ( exit interview ) program determine . Changes sedentary , physical activity functional outcome across time ( week 0 , 9 16 ) test . Intervention : For intervention , output baseline activity monitoring ( use activPAL activity monitor ) provide data usual activity behaviour . Action plan target area high sedentary behaviour throughout day develop . A wrist-worn activity Misfit monitor - motivational tool track adherence intervention use throughout intervention period ( i.e . 8 week ) . This device provide activity feedback user real time . A checklist use address : 1 ) use walk aid ; 2 ) incidence fall ; 3 ) review progression home exercise program ; 4 ) quality walk . Analysis : Descriptive statistic use summarize baseline data . Feasibility measurement ( reach , retention , satisfaction ) evaluate percentage . Changes activity functional outcome across time ( week 0 , 9 16 ) test use repeat measure analysis variance ( ANOVA ) . All analysis do STATA significance level set P &lt; 0.05 .</detailed_description>
