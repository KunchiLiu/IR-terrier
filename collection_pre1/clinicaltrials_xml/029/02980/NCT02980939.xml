	<brief_summary>During exercise heat , need replenish fluid order avoid dehydration decrease risk heat illness . What drive urge drink thirst mechanism . Following ingestion fluid , inhibition thirst replenish fluid . However , little scientific evidence thirst inhibit , thirst inhibition augment exercise thirst influence exercise performance . Further , rehydration study , difficult successfully blind subject drinking/hydration protocol . Previous study blind subject drinking use various method intravenous fluid administration and/or nasogastric tube . Therefore , purpose research examine mechanistic role thirst inhibition play exercise heat undergo intravenous fluid administration . Specific attention direct cardiovascular thermoregulatory function individual . All blood , cardiovascular , thermoregulatory , perceptual measure show diagram .</brief_summary>
