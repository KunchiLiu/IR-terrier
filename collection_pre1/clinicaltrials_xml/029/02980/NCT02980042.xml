	<brief_title>Tolerability Safety Switching From Rituximab Ocrelizumab Patients With Relapsing Forms Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Studies rituximab , chimeric monoclonal antibody CD20 show B-cell depletion clinical beneﬁt potential treatment relapse form multiple sclerosis ( MS ) .1 Ocrelizumab humanize monoclonal antibody target CD20 selectively deplete CD20 express cell , preserve capacity B cell reconstitution . When compare rituximab , ocrelizumab associate increased antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxic eﬀects , reduce complement-dependent cytotoxic eﬀects vitro.2 By increase antibody-dependent cell mediate cytotoxic eﬀects , ocrelizumab might modulate tissue-dependent mechanism pathogenic response eﬀectively compare rituximab . As humanized molecule , ocrelizumab expect less immunogenic repeat infusion might thus present favorable safety profile compare rituximab.2 Despite rituximab 's current label use treatment MS , currently data available phase 2 trial . The HERMES group conduct phase 2 , double-blind , 48-week trial involve 104 patient relapse form MS ; 69 patient received 1000 mg intravenous rituximab 35 patient receive placebo day 1 15.3 A significantly high number patient rituximab group ( 78.3 % ) versus placebo group ( 40.0 % ) infusion relate reaction ( IRR ) event within 24 hour first infusion . Within 24 hour second infusion , few patient rituximab group ( 20.3 % ) placebo group ( 40 % ) similar event . A majority rituximab group IRR event ( 92.6 % ) classify mild moderate ( grade 1 2 ) severity . Safety data Investigators Brochure OPERA I II phase 3 trial compare ocrelizumab interferon β-1a relapsing MS patient show IRRs common adverse event experience patient treat 600 mg ocrelizumab.4 The percentage patient experience IRRs high ocrelizumab group ( relapse form MS : 34.3 % ; primary progressive form MS 39.9 % ) compare interferon β-1a ( active control ) group receive placebo infusion ( relapse form MS : 9.7 % ; primary progressive form MS : 25.5 % ) . The rate IRRs high first infusion Dose 1 ( 27.5 % Day 1 ; 4.71 % Day 15 Dose 1 ) decrease time ( 13.7 % ; 9.6 % 7.8 % follow Dose 2 , 3 , 4 respectively ) ocrelizumab treat group . Comparatively , interferon β-1a user experience 6.5 % IRRs Day 1 , 2.58 % Day 15 , &lt; 2.00 % dose 2 , 3 4 respectively . The report IRRs primarily mild-to-moderate severity ( Grades 1 2 ) . Serious IRRs occur 0.1 % 1.0 % respectively relapse progressive patient treat ocrelizumab . Clinical data describe efficacy tolerability profile rituximab ocrelizumab utilized population different prior treatment characteristic . In phase 2 HERMES trial , majority ( 78.5 % ) rituximab patient previously treat disease modify therapy last 2 years.3 In contrast , OPERA I II phase 3 clinical trial , majority ocrelizumab patient ( 72.9 % OPERA I 73.8 % OPERA II ) represent treatment naïve population.4 Examining IRRs patient switch rituximab ocrelizumab versus continue rituximab examine magnitude IRRs subsequent tolerability ocrelizumab real world population . Earlier concept MS disease pathology suggest pathogenic T cell sufficient full expression MS . However , evident full autoimmune B cell humoral immune mechanism also play key role . 5 Ocrelizumab humanize monoclonal antibody target CD20 selectively deplete CD-20 express B cell . CD20 B cell surface molecule express pre B cell mature B cell , express earlier development B cell mature plasma cell . In three ocrelizumab study ( relapse progressive population ) , treatment 600 mg ocrelizumab lead rapid complete depletion circulate CD19+ B cell within 14 day post treatment . 4 B cell depletion sustain throughout treatment period . The median time repletion B cell 72 week ( range 27-175 week ) . We hypothesize switch rituximab treat patient ocrelizumab , proportion patient B cell depletion ( &lt; 1 % ) 6 month first third infusion ocrelizumab baseline assessment 6 month last dose rituximab similar finding OPERA I II . Immunogenicity result OPERA I II trial examine number patient treatment induce anti-drug antibody ( ADA ) ocrelizumab . 4 Of 807 patient receive ocrelizumab ADA assay post baseline sample control treatment period , 3 patient ( 0.4 % ) show treatment induce ADA ocrelizumab . Of , 1 patient test positive neutralizing antibody ( NAB ) ocrelizumab . During open label extension phase , prevalence ADA continue remain low post baseline incidence 1.9 % ( 2/103 treatment induce ADA ) . Currently little evidence examine prevalence treatment induce ADAs rituximab ocrelizumab patient switch former latter comparison continue rituximab patient . Therefore , perform assay detect ADAs rituximab ocrelizumab patient switch rituximab ocrelizumab Day 1 , 6 month 12 month ocrelizumab . Finally , IRRs hypothesize reaction autoantibody treatment drug possibly release cytokine CD20 express cell destroy ocrelizumab cause `` cytokine storm '' . Understanding process may lead mechanism may aid ameliorate infusion reaction . If associate ADA , might possible predictively premedicate patient . Alternatively , associate cytokine release , may possible eliminate premedication patient already CD20+cell deplete subsequent infusion . Therefore , assay profile certain cytokine serum 4 hour start ocrelizumab infusion . With ocrelizumab expect enter MS therapeutic market within next year , expect third party payer within outside US require FDA EMA approve version anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody use treatment MS , namely ocrelizumab . Currently , estimate several thousand MS patient US Sweden take rituximab currently . Thus , important demonstrate switch chimeric anti-CD20 fully humanize anti-CD20 lead unexpected infusion reaction increase probability development anti-drug antibody . The Rocky Mountain MS Center ( RMMSC ) University Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus prescribe rituximab infusion 533 MS patient last 12 month , 323 patient receive infusion University Colorado Hospital 's Outpatient Infusion Center September , 2015-March , 2016 . The RMMSC one sit nationwide large number MS patient treat rituximab . With anticipated approval ocrelizumab , current rituximab user counsel MS provider RMMSC consider switch ocrelizumab post approval , particularly US Payers adopt FDA approve version prefer anti-CD20 agent MS .</detailed_description>
