	<brief_summary>PURPOSE The purpose case series clinically , radiographically histologically evaluate treatment dehiscence defect extraction socket use minimally-invasive GBR technique involve application particulate bone allograft non-resorbable PTFE membrane . METHODS Subjects single-rooted teeth indicate extraction interested future implant therapy tooth replacement recruit basis eligibility criterion . A buccal lingual dehiscence defect must strongly suspect confirm upon clinical examination order subject qualify study inclusion . A cone-beam computer tomography ( CBCT ) scan arch contain tooth extract obtained prior tooth extraction . Following minimally invasive tooth extraction debridement , socket evaluate verify presence dehiscence defect affect least 50 % bony plate height . After create soft tissue 'pouch ' use tunnel instrument , non-absorbable dense-PTFE ( dPTFE ) barrier membrane trim size shape would allow complete extension exist defect tuck mucosa alveolar bone . Then , extraction socket graft particulate allograft access socket seal extension membrane external cross mattress suture . Subjects recall 1 , 2 5 week monitor heal assess level discomfort use visual analog scale end visit . At 5-week visit , membrane gently remove exposed area leave heal secondary intention . At 20 week tooth extraction second CBCT obtain radiographically evaluate site implant placement . Bone volumetric reconstruction alveolar ridge baseline 20 week make use CBCT data ass change affect bone housing . If site heal adequately , implant placement plan 24 week tooth extraction . A bone core biopsy obtain time implant placement order histologically analyze characteristic graft substrate . Upon implant placement primary stability heal abutment place suture give achieve primary wound closure , necessary . Subjects return final study visit 2 week follow implant placement evaluate heal prior refer back restorative dentist .</brief_summary>
