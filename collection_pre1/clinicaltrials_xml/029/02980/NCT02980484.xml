	<brief_title>fMRI-neuronavigated rTMS Treatment Major Depression Associated With TBI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>rTMS FDA-approved treatment major depressive disorder , utility yet investigate major depression associate traumatic brain injury . This prospective double-blind randomize sham-controlled crossover study . Patients treatment group receive 20 session high-frequency rTMS leave dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) low-frequency rTMS right DLPFC . The DLPFC identify target use individual subject-level resting state network estimation ( Hacker et al , 2013 ) . Patients control group receive 20 sham treatment design visibly indistinguishable active treatment , subsequently option cross receive active treatment aforementioned protocol . A subgroup patient group receive detail diffusion image ( diffusion tensor diffusion kurtosis image ) rest state fMRI scan treatment order ass change white matter integrity functional connectivity associate treatment .</detailed_description>
