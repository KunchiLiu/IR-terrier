	<brief_summary>Accumulating evidence suggest colorectal cancer ( CRC ) progression solely determine genetic abnormality tumor cell also host response . Indeed , recent study CRC associate improved survival high number tumor-infiltrating ( TIL ) memory cytotoxic T lymphocytes , suggest link tumor progression situ T cell response . Gene expression profile study clearly isolate well-known subgroup CRC characterize microsatellite instability ( MSI ) CRC , associate strong immune response signature involve Th1/cytotoxic immune evasion pathway . Moreover , investigator previously show HLA-E/Î²2m overexpressed tumor cell roughly 20 % CRC associate bad prognosis , likely due NK T effector cell function upon engagement inhibitory NK receptor CD94/NKG2A . However , recent result enlarger cohort patient suggest observation hold true MSS CRC , HLA-E over-expression inversely associate good prognosis MSI CRC . Thus , phenotype function TIL , depend MSI/MSS status CRC precis . The investigator hypothesize MSI CRC , know express high number MSI-H related frameshift peptide represent pool tumor specific antigen , HLA-E could present peptide TCR non conventional CD8+ HLA-E-restricted alpha-betaT cell ( also express CD94 ) , induce strong antitumor cytolytic activity . Therefore , aim project determine exact phenotype , function specificity CD94+ TIL CRC , depend HLA-E MSI/MSS status tumor cell . These result could impact clinical practice anti-NKG2A monoclonal antibody frameshift peptide base immunotherapy could promise new therapeutic option CRC patient .</brief_summary>
