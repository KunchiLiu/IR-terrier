	<brief_summary>Stroke life-threatening medical condition occurs due sudden disruption blood supply brain . Although may affect age group include child , elderly great risk stroke . Indeed , three-quarter stroke see people age 65 . Unfortunately , due short therapeutic window ( 4.5 h stroke onset ) , 2-3 % patient receive currently available single medical therapy rt-PA , clot-busting agent . As recent study show bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cell , type stem cell , may migrate site injury repair damage brain vessel tissue , possible number functional capacity may determine clinical outcome stroke patient i.e . severely disabled , moderately disabled sign . This study ass parameter elderly stroke patient compare age-matched stroke-free counterpart healthy young volunteer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Ischaemic stroke develops interference blood supply brain continue one leading cause morbidity mortality World . Global medical statistic reveal ~75 % stroke patient older 65 year stroke occurrence double every 10 year age 55 men woman . Although various mechanism may alter structure function adult brain age process , endothelial dysfunction regard main pathology render cerebral vessel susceptible atherosclerosis subsequent vascular event . Endothelial dysfunction also constitute main cause vascular abnormality lacunar stroke result occlusion one penetrating artery deep within brain . Cortical stroke represent another common form ischaemic stroke develop embolism heart large artery . As endothelium maintain vascular balance regulation many distinct function like vascular permeability , tone inflammation , crucial importance preserve integrity function time prevent age- stroke-related vascular damage . Recent study show bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cell ( EPCs ) play key role sustain appropriate endothelial function re-endothelialisation blood vessel adult brain ischaemic setting . Like embryonic angioblasts , EPCs equip inherent capacity circulate , proliferate differentiate . Hence , marker endothelial maturity ( KDR ) , immaturity ( CD133 ) stemness ( CD34 ) must simultaneously detect relevant study identify endothelial-committed undifferentiated cell . It likely environmental change , like oxidative stress , inflammatory response nitric oxide availability , evoke ischaemic injury aging may also suppress generation function EPCs . As mobilisation , recruitment home EPCs sit vascular injury mediate various growth factor like SDF-1 ( stromal cell-derived factor-1 ) , VEGF ( vascular endothelial growth factor ) GCSF ( granulocyte-colony stimulating factor ) , likely diminished expression factor may also negatively influence number function EPCs . Interestingly , little data functional numerical alteration EPCs chronic phase stroke , current data regard EPC level acute subacute phase disease inconsistent stable , increase decreased number report compare healthy subjects.The time course EPC release acute cerebral infarction also remain inconclusive . In light , aims current study reveal whether 1- variation circulate EPC level and/or functional aspect may use marker identify ischaemic stroke subtypes predict patient ' outcome ; 2- difference EPC number/function acute , subacute chronic phase stroke correlate severity functional outcome ischaemic stroke ; 3- EPC count function affect age process ; 4- level activity key pathophysiological element like VEGF , inflammatory cytokine nitric oxide , know affect EPC count function , differ patient lacunar cortical stroke stroke patient healthy counterpart . STUDY MANAGEMENT Independent outcome assessment ( mRS , BI , NIHSS ) perform admission day 7 , 30 90 stroke . The laboratory procedure carry post-doctoral research fellow collate analyse data . The Chief Investigator overall responsibility study shall oversee study management . The data custodian Chief Investigator . PARTICIPANT DURATION Each participant stroke followed-up 90 day time recruitment . Elderly young healthy volunteer see . RECRUITMENT Participants recruit Nottingham University Hospitals Stroke Services . The initial approach member patient 's usual care team ( may include investigator ) inform participant nominated representative aspect pertain participation study . It explain potential participant entry study entirely voluntary treatment care affect decision . It also explain withdraw time . PARTICIPANT WITHDRAWAL Participants may withdraw study case disease progression withdrawal consent . The participant make aware affect future care . INFORMED CONSENT No patient recruit study without obtain write informed consent . In case incapacity , consent appropriate personal consultee seek . The Investigator explain detail study provide Participant Information Sheet . Participants offer 24 hour consider participation . However , allow consent early time , prefer . In case stroke patient regain capacity , re-consented ongoing participation study . STATISTICS All result include subject characteristic report meansÂ±SD . Continuous variable , include age circulate EPC level analyse independent t-test among group . Circulating EPC level different time point ( within 48 h day 7 , 30 90 post-stroke ) compare use repeat measure ANOVA . Scheffe 's multiple comparison use analyse intra-individual course parameter time . These compare among patient lacunar cortical stroke . Multiple logistic regression analysis determine independent impact different predictive variable functional outcome neurological deficit . Sample size calculate allow failure patient attendance day 30 90 ( ~15 % time point ) possibility patient illness/death course study ( ~5 % ) . ADVERSE EVENTS As interventional study , adverse event anticipate develop . Adverse event venepuncture deal accord standard practice . DATA PROTECTION The study form collect minimum require information purpose study . Study form hold securely , lock room , lock cupboard cabinet . Access information limit study staff investigator relevant regulatory authority . Computer hold data include study database hold securely password protect . All data store secure dedicate web server . Access restrict user identifier password ( encrypt use one way encryption method ) . Information study participant 's medical record / hospital note treat confidentially way confidential medical information . Electronic data back every 24 hour local remote medium encrypt format . STUDY DATA Monitoring study data shall include confirmation informed consent ; source data verification ; data storage data transfer procedure ; local quality control check procedure , back-up disaster recovery local database validation data manipulation . The Academic Supervisor , require , nominated designee Sponsor , shall carry monitoring study data ongoing activity . Entries study form verify inspection source data . A sample study form ( 10 % per study risk assessment ) check regular basis verification entry make . In addition subsequent capture data study database check . Where correction require carry full audit trail justification . Study data evidence monitoring system audit make available inspection as/when require .</detailed_description>
