	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine shorter-acting spinal anesthetic call mepivacaine advantage longer-acting medication call bupivacaine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mepivacaine vs. Bupivacaine Spinal Anesthetic Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Different medication last different amount time change depend length procedure . A short act spinal generally use procedure last less 90 minute . A longer acting medication would last longer 90 minute . These medication block signal travel along pain nerve , also prevent signal tell patient muscle move . This mean total knee replacement patient may delay ability get start walk early surgery . Walking early recovery show decrease rate pulmonary embolism death . Ambulating early also important prevent loss strength , constipation , pneumonia urinary retention .</detailed_description>
