	<brief_title>Optimal Timing Intercostal Nerve Blocks During Video-Assisted Thoracic Surgeries</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The design study double-blind , prospective , multi-center , randomize , control clinical trial preemptive vs. post-closure intercostal injection ropivacaine control post-video-assisted thoracotomy ( VATS ) pain . In standard intercostal nerve block procedure , content A ( total 10 mL-solution consist 9 mL ropivacaine HCl 0.5 % 1 mL dexamethasone 4mg/mL preparation ) C ( total 25 mL solution consist 24 mL ropivacaine HCl 0.5 % , 1 mL dexamethasone-4mg/mL preparation , 0.125 mL epinephrine-1:1000 preparation ) combine one set injection inject intercostal space T5-6 , T6-7 , T7-8 , T8-9 T9-10 , intercostal space receive 7 mL combine A C solution ( intercostal space receive 2 mL A 5 mL C ) . In study , intercostal nerve block split two set injection : one set injection begin VATS , set right closure . Therefore investigator consider set injection research procedure . Patients randomly assign receive preemptive 2mL-injection A injection B ( contain 10 mL 0.9 % normal saline ) intercostal space previously delineate operating surgeon . Both research team surgical team blind nature injectates surgery . As part standard care procedure , patient monitor non-invasive ASA standard addition invasive arterial blood pressure monitoring . Prior closure , patient receive injection A beginning surgery receive second set injection contain mixture B C ( 5 mL solution C give intercostal space ) intercostal space previously delineate . Patients receive injection B begin surgery receive second set injection contain mixture A C ( 5 mL solution C give intercostal space ) . The investigator group patient assign receive injectate A end surgery control group . Because injectate A injectate C usually give together one set injection anatomical location standard intercostal nerve block procedure , intercostal block receive control group closely resemble procedure perform standard intercostal nerve block . Patients receive injectate A beginning surgery group experimental group . Regardless group assignment , total dosage ropivacaine dexamethasone give patient equal dosage give standard care procedure . Post operative pain , ventilatory profile length hospital stay compare two study arm .</detailed_description>
