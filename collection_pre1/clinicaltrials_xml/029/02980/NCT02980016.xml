	<brief_summary>This study parallel , two part , open label , individually randomize , pragmatic trial among HIV-positive individual . Part A compare single round weekly high dose rifapentine plus isoniazid three month ( 3HP ) six month daily isoniazid ( 6H ) . Part B compare periodic 3HP ( p3HP ) single round 3HP .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Effect 3HP v Periodic 3HP v 6H HIV-Positive Individuals</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Part A : A randomised control trial 3HP v 6H [ enrollment start concurrently Part B ] Justification : The World Health Organization ( WHO ) recommend least six month isoniazid ( 6H ) person live HIV . However , 6H remains poorly implement high burden tuberculosis ( TB ) country . In 2015 guideline , WHO include 3HP latent tuberculosis infection ( LTBI ) treatment option high-income upper middle-income country TB incidence rate &lt; 100/100,000 . One trial compare 3HP 6H high burden country suggest single round 3HP less toxicity , good treatment completion rate , similar efficacy prevent TB . The purpose compare single round 3HP 6H demonstrate feasibility implement 3HP high burden country , explore safety effectiveness , generate evidence guide WHO recommendation use 3HP high burden setting . Sample size : If assume 85 % patient 6H arm complete treatment define , 400 patient 6H arm 3600 patient 3HP arm 82 % power detect increase treatment completion 5 % ( To -90 % ) 3HP arm . If treatment completion 6H arm 75 % , approximately 90 % power detect increase treatment completion 7 % 3HP arm . Analysis : Treatment completion compare study arm use Fishers Exact test , associate risk difference 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) . Part B : A randomised control trial 3HP v p3HP [ enrollment start concurrently Part A ] Justification : A single round 3HP show non-inferior 9 month isoniazid ( 9H ) person high risk develop TB low middle TB burden setting . Similarly , single round 3HP demonstrate similar efficacy prevent active TB compare 6H among HIV-positive , tuberculin skin test ( TST ) -positive adult high burden set South Africa . In high burden setting , 6H 3HP provide protection limit duration probably due high ongoing transmission reinfection . Continuous isoniazid preventive therapy show provide durable protection high burden setting , currently policy outside handful country , actual uptake poor . Giving 3HP periodically may provide durable protection , easy health system implement , may associate good adherence few side effect . Sample size : Assuming cumulative TB incidence 5 % 2 year control ( 3HP ) arm , overall loss follow-up 10 % year 2 , two-sided type I error 5 % , 1:1 randomisation , superiority comparison 1800 participant per arm , 80 % power detect 40 % reduction cumulative TB incidence month 0 24 . Analysis : The analysis compare 3HP p3HP two year follow . Cumulative TB incidence determine combine incident TB case identify 24 month follow AND prevalent TB case identify 12 24 month culture survey . Data report risk difference odds ratio associate 95 % CIs , adjust randomisation stratum . The secondary outcome compare effectiveness p3HP 3HP month 13 24 ( time great effect likely evident ) conduct use analytic method . The result Part B disseminate subsequent result Part A .</detailed_description>
