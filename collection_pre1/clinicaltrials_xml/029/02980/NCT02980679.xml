	<brief_summary>A 99mTc Pertechnetate ( G-PERT ) scan nuclear medicine test create image thyroid gland organ . G-PERT approve Health Canada direct imaging measurement thyroid uptake . Doctors researcher University Alberta develop new method produce 99mTc Pertechnetate ( call CTC ) . It make cyclotron Medical Isotope Cyclotron Facility ( MICF ) University Alberta , Edmonton , Alberta . This new production method provide another source 99mTc Pertechnetate . The aim study confirm CTC safe use interchangeably G-PERT .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Compare Safety Imaging Pattern Cyclotron-produced Technetium ( CTC ) vs. Generator-produced Technetium ( G-PERT ) People With Thyroid Disorders Who Need Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The clinical trial Phase III , prospective , crossover , image interpretation blind , single site study . All subject receive Tc-99m pertechnetate ( one CTC one G-PERT administration separate least 48 hour ) subsequently image thyroid uptake whole body biodistribution . The order scan randomize . The thyroid image interpret uptake / uptake thyroid , whole body biodistribution image interpret uptake / uptake select anatomical site . Interpretation thyroid image result compare clinical finding ( pre-surgical ultrasound , fine needle aspirate , post-surgical pathology result , available ) . All imaging assessment conduct 1 blind Nuclear Medicine physician . A safety evaluation conduct subject receive CTC , consist vital sign , haematology SMA-12 serum biochemistry profile ( pre-injection post-imaging ) , , CTC G-PERT , adverse event assessment ( subject leave Nuclear Medicine department ) administration .</detailed_description>
