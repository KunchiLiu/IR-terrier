	<brief_summary>Hypothesis PRO-157 ( Project-157 ) ophthalmic solution safe effective , demonstrate non-inferiority , compare Moxifloxacin Gatifloxacin treatment conjunctivitis . General objective : ass safety efficacy PRO-157 ophthalmic solution three different dose regimen , versus Moxifloxacin , versus Gatifloxacin patient bacterial conjunctivitis . Specific objective : determine safety PRO-157 ophthalmic solution three different dosage versus Moxifloxacin versus Gatifloxacin patient bacterial conjunctivitis incidence adverse event . evaluate efficacy PRO-157 ophthalmic solution three different dose regimen , versus Moxifloxacin , versus Gatifloxacin patient bacterial conjunctivitis evaluation ocular sign symptom : burning , tear , foreign body sensation , pruritus , photophobia , Conjunctival hyperemia , chemosis , secretion , membrane / pseudomembranes , scale eyelid edema , epitheliopathy . Number participant : 300 eye , 60 per group . Inclusion criterion : Patients bacterial conjunctivitis ( sign / symptom / culture ) Treatment duration : Recruitment : 4 month Treatment : 7 day Follow-up : 15 day Criteria evaluation : Measurements effectiveness : Main efficacy criterion It determine effective reduction number specie bacterial flora compare basal culture final culture among five different patient group . Reduction absence infection clinical evaluation sign symptom burn , tear , foreign body sensation , pruritus , photophobia , conjunctival hyperemia , chemosis , secretion , eyelid edema , membrane pseudomembranes , palpebral scale epitheliopathy Safety Measurements : determine visual acuity adverse event This phase II multicenter , evaluate 5 treatment arm . Patients recruit diagnosed bacterial conjunctivitis treat 7 day three dos PRO-157 , Moxifloxacin , Gatifloxacin . The randomization coordinate member research team previously designate principal investigator ( PI ) mask instruct patient apply drop , emphasize patient mention evaluate physician frequency study medication . For protocol purpose , infect eye ( ) take account time baseline , however study medication procedure apply performed eye protect healthy eye . The study divide follow evaluation period : Visit 1 baseline ( day 1 ) , visit 2 ( day 3 ) , final visit ( day 8 ) . telephone call ( day 23 ) evaluation adverse event 15 day last drug application . In visit PI take photograph eye make visual clinical comparison end study . Subjects allocate follow regimen dosage : - PRO-157 1 drop 2 time daily eye - PRO-157 1 drop 3 time daily eye . - PRO-157 1 drop 4 time daily eye . - Moxifloxacin 1 drop 3 time daily eye . - Gatifloxacin 1 drop 3 time daily eye . All regimen dosage duration 7 day . An artificial tear preservative free ( Lagricel Ofteno® ) also apply 15 minute instillation study drug , study period . Data Analysis The data analyze Intention Treat ( ITT ) per Protocol ( PP ) , variable describe , ITT population constitute subject recruit receive least one dose study , PP population subset ITT compose subject without major deviation protocol bivariate analysis perform group . Continuous quantitative variable express presented measure central tendency dispersion ( mean , standard deviation range ) . Qualitative nominal ordinal variable present mean frequency proportion . The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test perform know normal distribution result obtain study group . The difference between-group determine ANOVA test , quantitative variable . For qualitative variable , Pearson 's chi-square use . Intra-group difference analyze use T-test case quantitative variable . For qualitative variable difference calculate Pearson 's chi-square . The level significance alpha 0.05 less .</brief_summary>
