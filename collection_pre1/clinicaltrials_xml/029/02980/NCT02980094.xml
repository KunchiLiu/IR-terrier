	<brief_summary>The project aim study effect inclusion sunflower oil , vitamin E selenium diet dairy cow milk composition influence modify milk nutrition health elderly . To achieve goal , two experiment conduct , last 12 week . In first one , 24 cow begin lactation allot completely randomized block design 2 x 2 factorial arrangement treatment , follow : 1 ) control diet ; 2 ) control diet plus selenium vitamin E ; 3 ) control diet plus sunflower oil diet ; 4 ) control diet plus sunflower oil , selenium vitamin E. This experiment seek development modify milk nutritional manipulation cow 's diet . Concomitantly , second experiment , 100 elderly people receive four different kind milk produce first experiment completely randomize block ( gender ) design . The selection elderly group shall compose clinical evaluation . Will conduct biochemical test supplementation milk consumption ( serum Î±-tocopherol , selenium , analysis fatty acid profile ) . Assessment nutritional status make body mass index ( BMI ) participant experiment 12 week , include body composition multifrequency bioelectrical impedance analysis ( BIA ) , evaluate strength pressure hand portable dynamometer , demographic food consumption . The study human nutrition health hold form double-blind study . The second experiment aim study nutrition health elderly people , expect milk produce well fatty acid profile , vitamin mineral improve inflammatory profile marker elderly . This project important human population general , particularly elderly people , health worker , human animal nutritionist , especially milk chain , potential develop new dairy product boost milk consumption .</brief_summary>
