	<detailed_description>Background : The cardiovascular manifestation primary hyperparathyroidism ( PHPT ) debate many year . PHPT highly symptomatic disease severe symptom . Today , clinical presentation disease often asymptomatic symptom diagnose . This may reason literature regard area conflicting . Studies observe increased mortality cause cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) moderate severe disease , whereas study focus mild disease observe increase risk mortality . A shift clinical presentation disorder asymptomatic appearance make pivotal investigate CVD risk patient PHPT surgery . Large-arterial stiffness know predictor cardiovascular event all-cause mortality . Measurement carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity ( PWV ) consider gold standard non-invasive measurement arterial stiffness . To date , study investigate relationship PWV PHPT . In three prospective study author report significant increase PWV preoperative PHPT patient compare control . 6-month parathyroidectomy two study observe significant decrease PWV , one study observe non-significant decrease . Another study Ring et al observe slightly , significant increase PWV PHPT patient compare control change surgery 1-year follow-up . However , study Tordjman et al observed difference PWV among PHPT patient compare control . In addition , study explore relationship arterial stiffness PHPT use either augmentation index ( AIx ) carotid intima-media thickness ( IMT ) predictor arterial stiffness . Three study focus AIx report increased AIx PHPT patient , whereas two study observe increased AIx PHPT patient compare control . Using IMT method , two study report significant increased IMT PHPT patient preoperative compare control significant decrease parathyroidectomy . Furthermore , study Walker et al observe increased IMT PHPT patient compare control subsequent follow-up study change IMT surgery . In contrast , one study report difference IMT PTHP patient surgery . Most research far focus different method measurement arterial stiffness make comparison among study difficult . More research focus one method necessary . Another clinical aspect PHPT increase prevalence hypertension compare general population . Previous research finding parathyroidectomy 's effect hypertension inconsistent contradictory . Four study report effect parathyroidectomy preoperative hypertensive patient two study observe increased incidence hypertension surgery . However , four study observe significant postoperative reduction systolic diastolic BP among known hypertensive patient follow-up . Nevertheless , much uncertainty still exist research investigate relationship BP arterial stiffness pre- postoperative require . PWV consider gold standard non-invasive measurement arterial stiffness predictor cardiovascular event all-cause mortality . It therefore best approach ass association PHPT cardiovascular risk combination BP . In addition , study design prospective small population size . Therefore , need perform randomize controlled trial ( RCT ) compare arterial stiffness blood pressure ( BP ) patient mild PHPT pre- post-operative . This study first perform randomize control trial ( RCT ) investigate arterial stiffness BP patient PHPT . Hopefully , study able establish cardiovascular risk patient mild PHPT influence future international guideline management PHPT . Aim : The aim study establish whether patient mild PHPT increase risk cardiovascular disease . The primary outcome determine whether arterial stiffness BP decrease patient mild PHPT 3-month parathyroidectomy ( PTX ) . Arterial stiffness assess PWV BP sitting- 24-hour BP . In addition , study evaluate effect PTX serum cholesterol marker cardiovascular risk . Hypothesis : 1 . Patients PHPT increase cardiovascular risk assess BP , PP ( central pulse pressure ) arterial stiffness . 2 . PWV , PP BP patient PHPT decrease 3-month PTX . Study design : The study perform RCT enrol patient PHPT . Participants assess baseline subsequently randomize one two study group , i.e. , group PTX perform soon possible ( `` early PTX group '' [ EPTX-group ] ) group PTX perform three month study inclusion ( `` late PTX group '' [ LPTX-group ] ) . Follow-up perform 3 month PTX EPTX-group 3 month observation LPTX-group . All enrol participant undergo PWV , PP , BP blood sample baseline 3-month follow-up . Since woman affect disease substantially often men , randomization perform bloc randomization 4 participant bloc . In bloc two participant randomize either EPTX LPTX . With minimum 80 participant ( see statistic section power calculation ) enrol study 20 bloc create . Four bloc allocate men study . The first man include start randomization number 64 follow men give number 80 . If men include study unequal number , bloc mix woman men construct . Because inclusion criterion intention treat analysis ( see ) 80 people include calculate drop out . The principle bloc randomization describe follow create additional bloc four participant . If 16 men include continue receive number 81 . For likelihood demonstrate effect PTX cardiovascular risk PHPT patient , analysis restrict population obtain normal p-calcium PTX . Aarhus University Hospital primary center diagnostic treatment PHPT Region Central Denmark . Hence , refer patient possible PHPT contact hospital visit . Participants fulfil diagnostic criterion PHPT ask participation project . PHPT define elevate p-calcium minimum 3 measurement parathyroid hormone upper one-third reference range . Measurements : Questionnaires : Height weight measure participant . Additional information participant collect interview/questionnaires concern : previous current disease , history fracture , smoke status , consumption alcohol use medication . Medications cover prescribed medication , calcium vitamin-D supplementation natural medicine . Regarding female collect information age menarche , pregnancy , labour , menopause , previous current use hormonal contraceptive . For assessment quality life participant ask fill 36-Item Short Form Survey ( SF-36 ) either write form online baseline 3-month follow-up . Blood pressure : After 5 minute rest sit position BP measure right left upper arm . Recorded BP measure arm low BP three follow measurement perform 2 minute rest . The average last 2 measurement record . Furthermore , 24-hour BP measurement perform participant non-dominant arm . Tonometry : In supine position 10 minute rest PP PWV assess use SphygmoCor system ( AtCor Medical , cuff-based system ) applanation tonometry . The test perform fasting participant morning baseline follow avoid diurnal variation . A cuff place around right thigh measurement perform right carotid arterial . The carotid-femoral PWV estimate distance travel divide transit time . A minimum 2 reading perform 0.5 m/s difference two measurement three one perform . Biochemistry : Blood sample collect morning fasting , venepuncture , baseline 3-month follow-up . The concentration albumin , total ionized calcium , creatinine , hbA1C , total cholesterol , LDL , HDL , triglyceride , P-PTH , P-25 ( OH ) D subsequent determine . Plasma frozen later analysis apolipoprotein ( Apo-A Apo-B ) , high-sensitive CRP , interleukin-6 , TNF-alfa , VCAM-1 , fibrinogen , von Willebrand factor CD40L . Statistic : The difference two group assess use either pair t-test Mann-Whitney U-test depend distribution continuous variable . Pearson 's correlation coefficient use determine relationship variable . Multiple-linear regression analysis PWV , PP BT dependent variable perform adjust age , BP , height , smoke status , BMI , anti-hypertensive medication hyperlipidaemia . With sample size 40 participant group study 84 % power detect significant difference PWV 1 m/s treatment control group . This assumptions healthy person mean PWV 8.4 m/s standard deviation 1.5 m/s . Assuming mean arterial blood pressure 91 ( Â±8 ) mm Hg , sample size 40 participant group allow 80 % statistical power detect group difference 5 mm Hg ( p &lt; 0.05 ) . Since analysis restrict participant EPTX group obtain normal p-calcium , aim recruit 80-100 participant . Ethical aspect : The study perform current guideline develop Helsinki-declaration concern research human . Participants inform orally write project 's aim , execution possible side effect . The project entirely voluntarily participant withdraw consent anytime study , without reason . It affect ongoing future treatment participant decide withdraw . Only participant give full consent orally write enrol study . The wait period PTX operation Aarhus University Hospital normally 2-3 month therefore enrol participant control group maximum wait extra 2-4 week . As PHPT often disease develops several year , postponement treatment surgery week LPTX-group presume carry risk participant .</detailed_description>
