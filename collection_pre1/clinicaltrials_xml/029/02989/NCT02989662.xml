	<brief_title>INIA Stress Chronic Alcohol Interactions : Glucocorticoid Antagonists Heavy Drinkers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cortisol ( CORT ) glucocorticoid hormone , often associate response stress play key role alcohol use problem . First , acute alcohol administration increase CORT , turn amplifies mesolimbic dopamine reward signal . Second , alcohol withdrawal elevate CORT level AUD compare healthy control subject , CORT level early abstinence predict subsequent relapse drinking . Finally , magnitude CORT response external stressor predict motivation work consumption alcohol human laboratory natural environment . Importantly , recent study rodent human demonstrate block CORT activity use glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) antagonist reduces effect CORT alcohol behavior , indicate causal role glucocorticoid relationship . The propose research test effectiveness two glucocorticoid receptor antagonists different receptor bind side-effect profile . In alcohol use disorder ( AUD ) match healthy control ( HC ) men woman , propose research examine MIFE , demonstrate preclinical effect drinking-related behavior , CORT125134 , new medication improve safety profile yet unexamined efficacy AUD , breadth alcohol-related measure . All subject randomize daily MIFE , CORT125134 placebo . Before medication , AUD HC subject undergo fMRI scan measure resting-state functional connectivity alcohol cue-induced brain activation focus brain reward stress pathway . All subject admit Clinical Research Unit ; AUD subject undergo supervise alcohol withdrawal daily measurement alcohol crave symptom severity . Using validated human laboratory procedure AUD subject , study examine effect stress motivation drink alcohol sensitivity/reward function GR antagonism . This work help pave way improved pharmacotherapies target stress reward pathway brain involved initiating maintain drinking .</detailed_description>
