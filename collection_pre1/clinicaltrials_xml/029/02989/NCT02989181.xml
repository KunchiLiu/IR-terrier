	<brief_summary>The aim randomize control study investigate effect continue positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) treatment patient dilate cardiomyopathy ( DCM ) concomitant obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) . The primary endpoint leave ventricular function measure magnetic resonance ( improvement least 4 % ) six month treatment CPAP . The secondary endpoint include diastolic dysfunction , cardiovascular biomarkers quality life .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Continues Positive Airway Pressure Treatment Patients With Dilated Cardiomyopathy Obstructive Sleep Apnea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sleep apnea , either obstructive ( OSA ) central ( CSA ) , occur half patient heart failure ( HF ) , associate poor prognosis individual . Dilated cardiomyopathy ( DCM ) common type cardiomyopathy define presence leave ventricle dilatation leave ventricular systolic dysfunction without concurrent valvular coronary artery disease . Its etiology unclear , genetic component present least 25 % case . In young individual , etiology heterogeneous , rare type cardiomyopathy may occur woman connection pregnancy , s.c. peripartum cardiomyopathy . Other underlying cause include alcohol , drug , pharmaceutical , endocrine disorder , systemic disease general muscle . These factor account approximately half case DCM young half designate idiopathic ( IDCM ) . The relationship cardiomyopathy OSA insufficiently study far . In small population 20 individual DCM , sleep apnea ( OSA CSA ) 16 , ie 80 % patient . The first-line treatment OSA continue positive pressure breathe mask ( CPAP ) sleep patient daytime sleepiness . Effect CPAP therapy patient DCM OSA completely unknown , many report daytime sleepiness . The fact patient heart failure reduce pump function usually symptoms include fatigue , become difficult distinguish fatigue due heart failure relate sleep apnea . Interpretation Epworth Sleepiness Scale ( ESS ) thus difficult possibly unsure patient DCM OSA randomize treatment CPAP .</detailed_description>
