	<brief_summary>Methadone several advantage standard narcotic medication , especially consider use typically painful surgery lumbar fusion . Methadone low cost , long half-life , convenient dosing schedule , excellent oral bioavailability , demonstrate slow onset withdrawal . The literature compare methadone commonly use post-operative narcotic demonstrate manages pain well , sustain consistent plasma concentration , decrease overall narcotic requirement , result additional adverse event , safe , even child , across several study . Since standard care non-methadone narcotic usage manage significant pain complex spinal surgery case , understandable methadone could desirable alternative promote sustain pain control early ambulation patient . The goal study compare effect single dose methadone administer intraoperatively enrol spinal fusion patient historical control give fentanyl morphine , determine sustain pain control first day surgery provide well subjective experience patient less pain , allow ambulate leave hospital sooner patient give standard regimen .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Methadone synthetic opioid analgesic agonist property µ-opioid receptor bind site long use alternative morphine hydromorphone patient severe pain . It diffuse bioavailability highly efficacious oral form , yet bioavailability heavily dependent variability cytochrome P450 3A4 activity , quite variable amongst individual . Methadone reach peak plasma concentration 2.5 4 hour oral administration , rapid onset , half-life 20-35 hour ( range 5-130 hour ) , analgesia may report 108 hour single dose . Additionally , methadone 's NMDA receptor site antagonism act inhibit enzyme adenyl cyclase downstream production secondary signal molecule like cyclic AMP . This activity may attenuate opioid tolerance opioid abstinence syndrome NMDA receptor agonism implicate development hyperalgesia , acute chronic tolerance , chronic pain state . IV dose typically range 2.5mg 10mg every 8-12 hour , PO form dose 5-20mg every 6-8 hour . In study surgical patient , 40 % require additional post-operative pain control single 20mg iv methadone dose intra-operatively , 35 % require single additional dose require average 18.4±6.6 hour post-operatively . The remainder receive additional non-narcotic pain medication post-operatively sufficient control pain tolerable level . In series 29 patient undergoing multilevel thoracolumbar spine surgery instrumentation fusion , patient randomize receive either methadone ( 0.2mg/kg ) sufentanil infusion 0.25µg/kg/h load 0.75 µg/kg.Post-operative pain control deliver patient-controlled analgesia patient assess visual analogue scale pain , opioid dose , side effect 1 , 2 , 3 day post-operatively . Patients report less pain methadone group 48 hour post-operatively , well use less cumulative narcotic dose remifentanil control group . Side effect significantly different two group . This study however , evaluate post-operative functional status , ambulation , time discharge . The literature compare methadone commonly use post-operative narcotic demonstrate manages pain well , decrease narcotic requirement , result additional adverse event , safe , even child . Since standard care narcotic usage manage significant pain complex spinal surgery case , understandable methadone could desirable therapy promote sustain pain control early ambulation patient . The current hypothesis methadone use intra-operatively result earlier time ambulate post op well ability participate post-operative physical therapy evaluation , low narcotic usage , early discharge . It also foreseeable since methadone would administer patient sedate intra-operatively , could prevent association analgesia euphoria may result self- nurse-administered narcotic , patient-controlled analgesia ( PCA ) , could promote early tolerance reliance . The study plan enroll first 30 consecutive patient meet inclusion criterion , end goal 20 patient complete study . Patient recruit office time consent surgery principal investigator schedule undergo 1 2 level lumbar decompression fusion surgery . The study outline prospective , positive-control , single-blinded study . On day surgery , patient 's pre-operative pain functional status assess , addition review study protocol . An anesthesiologist assign case administer 0.2 mg/kg single-dose administration methadone incision ( exceed 20 mg , use literature ) ketamine infusion 4 µg/kg/min remifentanil infusion start 0.1 µg/kg/min titrate effect sufentanil infusion start dose 0.3 µg/kg/hr titrate effect . These standard dos well document studied literature overseen approve Board certify anesthesiologist . For lengthy procedure , re-dosing narcotic toward end procedure . The operative procedure alter way purpose study , beyond scope protocol , yet detail request . The patient take recovery room post-operative put standard post-operative morphine PCA rate 1mg per 6 minute lock-out period . Patient 's narcotic usage pain rating record interval list stable cardiovascular standpoint , transition neurosurgery floor . Once able bare weight , patient encourage work physical occupational therapy per standard post-operative protocol . Once patient us PCA rate less hour , manage oral pain medication , PCA remove . The remainder post-operative care accord standard departmental protocol , milestone ambulation , void , pain control met , discharge either home , acute care facility , subacute rehabilitation center . Any adverse events/reactions record manage normally would , naloxone available suspicion narcotic overdose The subject study compare historical control demonstrate effect methadone post-operative pain , medication usage , rehabilitation time . A goal 30 patient plan enrol . Other intra-operative narcotic administration , portion intra-operative post-operative care remain historical patient . The primary outcome study include total narcotic dose post-operative , frequency narcotic use , time first ambulation surgery physical therapy , length stay , disposition ( i.e . level rehabilitative care ) . Secondary outcome include well subjective pain control , need post-operative course dexamethasone post-operative/post-fusion radiculopathy neurapraxia/neuropathy , fusion 3-6 month .</detailed_description>
