	<brief_summary>The aim perform randomise feasibility trial precede large prospective randomise control trial ( RCT ) compare three surgical method - trabeculectomy Mitomycin C ( MMC ) , primary Baerveldt tube MMC Baerveldt tube without MMC - black African/African Caribbean patient Primary Open Angle Glaucoma ( POAG ) live London . The UK Office National Statistics estimate among population England 2007 , approximately 4.3 % African/African-Caribbean background , large city London Birmingham 20 % population African/African-Caribbean origin . For eye unit city , manage glaucoma population challenge need identify well alternative current standard surgical treatment . There evidence one RCT show good overall outcome tube surgery comparison trabeculectomy glaucoma . However , study address black population specifically address potential role MMC tube surgery . This feasibility study enable u design fully power RCT aim determine best optimise surgical treatment POAG black population , compare outcome three type glaucoma surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>An audit perform St Thomas 's Hospital 2008 show 52 trabeculectomy 50 Baerveldt tube procedure do one year , 60 % patient 'black ' ethnicity . This audit provide basis teh recruitment target . Assuming majority trabeculectomies perform POAG 'black ' patient would eligible trial . Primary Tube versus Trabeculectomy Study ( PTVT ) St Thomas ' Hospital lead recruit centre multinational study . The investigator recruit 50 patient last 2 year despite lack dedicate research team . The trial retention rate also good less 5 % loss follow-up rate . Patient Feedback Involvement The propose research review feedback session 2012 5 black African-Caribbean/African patient glaucoma attend St Thomas ' Hospital . All positive potential trial understood 'unique ' problem glaucoma surgery group patient . Suggestions trial include emphasis importance treatment glaucoma , disseminate information trial community centre , possibility expert patient act patient advocate help recruitment glaucoma clinic present study local community centre . Feasibility study This protocol randomise feasibility trial compare standard treatment ( trabeculectomy MMC ) primary Baerveldt tube surgery without MMC black African/African-Caribbean patient POAG live London . The study look feasibility recruitment propose large scale RCT also help investigator refine methodology propose trial term outcome measure analysis . It also help investigator recruit patient user group input conduct monitoring main trial . Information study provide The investigator conduct feasibility study order get estimate likely recruitment rate main study collect information help investigator refine outcome measure main study allow valid calculation sample size need definitive study answer primary research question . The investigator use questionnaires gather data patient ' quality life health economic analysis also hope questionnaire give investigator information perspectives patient , include preference . This feasibility study help investigator explore gather useful information patient perspective . The feasibility study also inform plan main trial data management help develop community engagement recruitment strategy , include theri strategy publicise trial enhance recruitment . In addition , investigator intend use feasibility study recruit patient representative group input conduct monitor propose main study . Risks benefit The potential risk benefit patient participate feasibility study similar standard clinical care . All participant identify need glaucoma drainage surgery . Both trabeculectomy ( currently first line treatment ) Baerveldt tube surgery ( currently second line treatment ) routine use treatment POAG . Evidence beneficial effect MMC equivocal . First line treatment Baerveldt tube surgery may associate less failure complication first line treatment trabeculectomy yet definitive evidence question specific population include study .</detailed_description>

In recent audit , almost 90 % case note data patient ' selfreported ethnicity . Age 18 85 year , inclusive . Inclusion criterion study eye All criterion list must present study eye order patient eligible enrolment study : • Glaucoma uncontrolled tolerated medical therapy IOP ≥18 mmHg ≤40 mmHg study eye . • No previous incisional ocular surgery study eye except : ) Clear corneal phacoemulsification surgery . ii ) Previous conjunctival spar minimally invasive glaucoma surgery ( MIGS ) 6 month ago . This may include procedure involve conjunctiva Hydrus Microstent , iStent endoscopic cyclophotocoagulation ( ECP ) laser . The author think likely pseudophakia influence outcome randomisation stratify lens status ensure balance treatment arm . General Exclusion Criteria Patients ineligible participate study follow criterion apply : Any inclusion criterion meet . Pregnant nursing woman ( plan pregnancy ) . Unwilling unable give inform consent , unwilling accept randomisation , unable return schedule protocol visit . Ongoing participation interventional clinical trial . Exclusion criterion study eye The patient may enter study follow exclusion criterion present study eye : No light perception vision . Active diabetic retinopathy . Secondary glaucoma . Unwilling discontinue contact lens use surgery . Conjunctival scar prior ocular trauma cicatrize disease ( e.g . Stevens Johnson syndrome , ocular pemphigoid ) preclude superior trabeculectomy . Functionally significant cataract likely require surgery within 6 month glaucoma surgery . Previous complicate cataract surgery study eye . Need glaucoma surgery combine ocular procedure ( i.e . cataract surgery , penetrate keratoplasty , retinal surgery ) anticipate need additional ocular surgery . Iris neovascularization proliferative retinopathy . Iridocorneal endothelial syndrome . Epithelial fibrous downgrowth . Chronic recurrent uveitis . Steroidinduced glaucoma .
