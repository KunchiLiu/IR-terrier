	<brief_summary>Background : Hyperthyroidism common disease . It common woman . It usually treat Radioiodine ( I-131 ) . Some people think might cause cancer , even many year later . Past study people hyperthyroidism clear cancer risk I-131 . Researchers want look group people disease get I-131 many year ago . They want look health month year later . Objective : To learn disease risk relation radiation I-131 treatment hyperthyroidism . Eligibility : People part previous study . These people diagnose hyperthyroidism U.S. U.K. hospital 1946 1964 . About 95 % participant already die . Design : Researchers examine data already collect past study . This include data participant later cancer health outcomes I-131 treatment . Researchers compare data National Death Index search . This already do data 2003 . This study cover 2004 2014 . Researchers touch study participant next kin ... .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hyperthyroidism ( thyrotoxicosis ) relatively common disease , especially among woman , radioiodine ( I-131 ) administration treatment choice adult patient . There concern possible carcinogenic effect I-131 therapy , previous study hyperthyroid patient present clear result regard cancer risk follow I-131 treatment . There also public concern regard late health consequence I-131 exposure radioiodine one primary release product nuclear power generation principal component fallout nuclear power plant accident . The Thyrotoxicosis Therapy Follow-up Study ( TTFUS ) cohort , assembled 1961 , comprise 35,000 subject treat hyperthyroidism 20 medical center US one Great Britain 1946 1964 . This among large group hyperthyroid patient follow subsequent cancer health outcome . The propose mortality follow-up study enable u assess nearly lifetime risk cancer diseases unique cohort . Mortality follow-up data extend observation 2015 , add 15 year , via linkage National Death Index search . Recently estimate I-131 radiation dose various body organ allow refine dose response analysis , provide definitive assessment nature magnitude risk cancer disease associate I-131 exposure well end-results I-131 treatment hyperthyroidism .</detailed_description>
