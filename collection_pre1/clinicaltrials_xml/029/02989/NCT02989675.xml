	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate impact dextrose administration severely sick child admit hospital low-glycaemia . The problem : Mortality child remain high sub-Saharan African hospital . While antimalarial drug , antibiotic definitive treatment well understood , role emergency care supportive therapy maintain normal glucose electrolyte balance , give limited attention . Hypoglycaemia common child admit hospital low-income setting . The current definition hypoglycaemia blood glucose level less 2.5mmol/l . Outcomes child poor , mortality rate 42 % . An increased mortality also report among acutely ill child low-glycaemia , define blood glucose level 2.5-5.0mmol/l . The reason increase mortality rate fully understood . Study objective : To determine impact mortality raise treatment cut-off level paediatric hypoglycaemia , 2.5mmol/l 5.0mmol/l . Methodology : Severely ill child admit Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital Blantyre , Malawi low-glycaemia ( 2.5-5.0mmol/l ) randomise intervention control group .
