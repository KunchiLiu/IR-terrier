	<detailed_description>TAVI recently provide therapeutic alternative patient symptomatic aortic stenosis inoperable high-risk surgical valve replacement . It document MRI study &gt; 70 % patient undergoing TAVI develop new cerebral infarct lesion . Of , ~3 % ~ 6 % represent clinical significant event ( transient ischemic attack , disable non-disabling stroke ) . With expected expansion TAVI low risk patient young age even silent cerebral lesion major importance [ 7 ] , thus way overcome decrease rapid wide penetration . Clinically apparent `` silent '' stroke TAVI may attribute range different mechanism . The source cerebral ischemia TAVI multifactorial . One proposed mechanism increase risk thrombus formation aortic atherosclerotic plaque bioprosthetic valve frame tissue due inadequate platelet inhibition TAVI . Furthermore , high residual platelet reactivity presence incomplete endothelial coverage valve follow TAVI may promote formation fibrin/platelet thrombus . Other mechanisms involve embolization variety origins i.e . atheroembolism ascend aorta aortic arch , calcific embolus aortic valve , thromboembolism catheter . Platelets main target preventative therapy cerebral ischemic event , owe observation , addition promote arterial thrombosis , platelet key role various nonthrombotic , inflammatory pathway plaque progression The clinical apparent `` silent '' embolic event may recognize TCD perform TAVI document publish clinical study . TCD accept surveillance technique neurological intervention ( TAVI , atrial septal defects/patent form ovale closure , carotid endarterectomy ) . Moreover , study utilize TCD TAVI evaluation potential embolization available . TCD observe HITS may quantify potentially correlated neurological event . However , note approach able discriminate exact source composition embolus The use embolic protection device ( e.g . Embrella Embolic Deflector system ) TAVI surprisingly show increase number cerebral ischemic lesion postprocedural brain imaging compare dual antiplatelet therapy . The first day post TAVI carry high risk thromboembolic event , thus special therapeutic diagnostic approach take consideration regard procedure . Similarly , surgical bioprosthetic valve implantation show high risk thromboembolic event within 3 month procedure . The administration monotherapy ASA biological aortic valve replacement fail show improvement incidence thromboembolic event . Dual antiplatelet therapy traditionally start prior TAVI continue 6 month . Nevertheless , fragile elderly patient dual antiplatelet therapy increase risk haemorrhage . In addition protection achieve agent questionable resistance aspirin Clopidogrel observe high percentage . Platelet Function Testing proven characterize patient high risk adverse outcome percutaneous coronary intervention . However , pharmacological intervention overcome increase risk establish . The use Ticagrelor proven reduce cerebral ischemic event acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) without significantly increase major bleeding complication , despite potent antithrombotic effect . Moreover , total mortality substantially decrease use Ticagrelor , risk intracranial hemorrhage fatal stroke low . In DISPERSE-2 Trial , slightly high rate minor bleed observe Ticagrelor compare Clopidogrel ; however major bleed event low Ticagrelor . Overall , total bleeding event similar Ticagrelor Clopidogrel group , well patient additional antithrombotic agent undergo invasive procedure . However , administration Ticagrelor allow great flexibility safety need discontinuation antiplatelet agent arise , half life 12 hour [ 16 ] . More importantly , Ticagrelor reversible platelet inhibitor , contrast Clopidogrel ASA bind irreversibly platelet cell membrane receptor cyclooxygenase enzyme respectively , whose effect persist duration platelet life span . Therefore , case bleed event antiplatelet therapy need deescalated , monotherapy Ticagrelor could prove safe option . Ticagrelor document demonstrate faster onset potent inhibition platelet aggregation Clopidogrel . These property Ticagrelor may contribute low rate thrombotic outcome compare Clopidogrel . However , bleed event concern potent antiplatelet agent Ticagrelor Prasugrel . This risk bleed correlate concomitant dosage ASA , therefore low effective dose 80mg ASA chosen background therapy study . Compared Prasugrel , another thienopyridine drug , Ticagrelor show provide potent effect microcirculation patient undergo percutaneous coronary intervention . Moreover , use current antiplatelet regimens post TAVI well establish clinical data . Currently , guideline regard antiplatelet pre- treatment TAVI . The European Society Cardiology practice guideline ( 2012 ) suggest real-life double antiplatelet regimen prescribe early post-TAVI period , without issue specific recommendation . Even wide clinical use dual antiplatelet therapy perioperatively TAVI , case thrombus formation bioprosthetic valve document . The manufacturer attribute event suboptimal operative placement bioprosthesis , therefore caution must take position bioprosthetic valve order reduce formation embolus could potentially cause clinically significant cerebral ischemic event . The use potent dual antiplatelet regimen Ticagrelor could prove efficient aspect . The present study aim evaluate whether platelet inhibition one new antiplatelet agent provide well cerebral protection microembolization cerebral circulation TAVI , currently use Clopidogrel . We hypothesize treatment Ticagrelor plus ASA vs. Clopidogrel plus ASA patient undergo TAVI result few HITS assess TCD middle cerebral artery . This first study directly compare treatment Ticagrelor Acetylsalicylic vs. Clopidogrel Acetylsalicylic regimen subject undergoing TAVI regard cerebral embolic event assess TCD middle cerebral artery . If significant reduction HITS number Ticagrelor group proven , implicate possible way decrease cerebral ischemic lesion TAVI subject . Undoubtedly , TAVI candidate increase number decreasing age , prevention neurological consequence paramount importance .</detailed_description>
