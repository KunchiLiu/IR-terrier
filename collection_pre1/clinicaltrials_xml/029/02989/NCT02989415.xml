	<brief_title>Assessment Ventilatory Management During General Anesthesia Robotic Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research question : 1 . What incidence PPC patient undergo mechanical ventilation general anesthesia robotic surgery ? 2 . Are outcomes patient undergo robotic surgery dependent ventilation practice surgical positioning ? 3 . What incidence patient high risk PPC undergo robotic surgery Methods : In international observational study , consecutive patient undergo mechanical ventilation robotic surgery eligible participation . Patients participate center screen daily basis . Patients undergoing mechanical ventilation robotic surgery include 30-day period . The inclusion period flexible participating center determine later stage together study-coordinator . Time point data collection : 1 . Demographic data baseline data , include severity score ( e.g . ASA ) ARISCAT , collect clinical file day surgery 2 . Ventilation setting , gas exchange variable , position vital parameter collect hourly surgery 3 . Chest radiography data available chest X-rays ( i.e. , extra chest X-rays obtain ) 4 . Predefined complication record medical chart first five postoperative day , discharge hospital death , whatever come first 5 . Length hospital stay , hospital mortality Centres : The investigator aim recruit 20 - 50 center worldwide . Ethics Approval : National coordinator responsible clarify need ethic approval apply appropriate accord local policy . Centres permit record data unless ethic approval equivalent waiver place . The investigator expect , every participate country , patient informed consent require . Monitoring : Due observational nature study , DSMB necessary . Study Population : Adult patient undergoing mechanical ventilation robotic surgery . Data Collection : Data collect inclusion , surgery every day five day , day hospital discharge . Data cod patient identification number ( PIN ) code keep safe local site . The data transcribe local investigator onto internet base electronic CRF . Sample Size Calculation : A formal sample size calculate , see largely descriptive character investigation . Data 500 patient expect collected , sufficient test hypothesis . Statistical Analysis : Patient characteristic compare described appropriate statistic . Student 's t-test Mann-Whitney U-tests use compare continuous variable chi-squared test use categorical variable . Data express mean ( SD ) , median ( interquartile range ) proportion appropriate . Comparisons within group perform use one-way ANOVA post-hoc analysis continuous variable . The primary analysis concern determination incidence postoperative pulmonary complication patient undergo mechanical ventilation robotic surgery . To identify potential factor associate outcome like development postoperative pulmonary complication , death , univariable analysis perform . A multi-level multivariable logistic regression model use identify independent risk factor . A gradual approach use enter new term model , limit p &lt; 0.2 enter term . Time event variable analyze use Cox regression visualize Kaplan-Meier . Organization : The study conduct PROtective VEntilation Network ( PROVENet ) . National co-ordinators lead project within individual nation identify participate hospital , translate study paperwork , distribute study paperwork ensure necessary regulatory approval place . They provide assistance participate clinical site trial management , record keep data management . Local coordinator site supervise data collection ensure adherence Good Clinical Practice trial .</detailed_description>
