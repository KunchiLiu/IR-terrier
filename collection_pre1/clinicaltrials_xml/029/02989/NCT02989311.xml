	<brief_summary>Infants young child sub-Saharan Africa high rate iron deficiency anemia ( IDA ) , adversely affect growth cognitive development . In-home iron fortification complementary food use micronutrient powder ( MNPs ) reduce risk IDA ensure iron need infant young child meet without change traditional diet . In order optimize iron absorption time MNP consumption might well important . This hepcidin , key regulator systemic iron balance , show circadian increase may influence morning versus afternoon iron absorption MNP . Furthermore , single dose iron increase hepcidin level potentially inhibit iron absorption second dose , consume close time first dose . To determine difference ) morning versus afternoon iron absorption ii ) consecutive versus alternate day iron absorption , investigator enrol 20 infant Kwale County age 6-14 month conduct two study . In study 1 , infant consume 2 test meal consist maize porridge contain isotopically label Ferrous Sulphate morning afternoon 2 day . In study 2 , infant consume 3 test meal consist maize porridge contain isotopically label Ferrous Sulphate two consecutive day 1 alternate day . In study , fourteen day last test meal administration , whole blood sample collect venipuncture iron isotopic analysis . Iron inflammation status parameter determine baseline endpoint . Hepcidin concentration measure morning afternoon meal ( study 1 ) second consecutive meal ( study 2 ) . Knowing effect time expect iron absorption inform decision ideal time MNP cover infant 's requirement absorb iron .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>20 infant recruit Msambweni County Referral Hospital southern coastal Kenya participate study . Study 1 : At baseline morning blood sample collect potential study participant determination follow iron inflammation status parameter : hemoglobin ( Hb ) , hepcidin , plasma ferritin ( PF ) , soluble transferrin receptor ( sTfR ) , zinc protoporphyrin ( ZnPP ) , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , alpha-1-acid glycoprotein ( AGP ) . Anthropometrics ( height , weight , mid-upper arm head circumference ) measure , demographic , medical history feed habit assess use questionnaire . Infants consume 1st test meal next day enrolment morning ( day1 ) . On day 2 2nd blood sample ( 1ml ) collect afternoon quantify afternoon concentration hepcidin plasma infant consume 2nd meal 3rd day afternoon . The two isotopically labelled test meal feed infant caregiver supervision research team . The morning test meal A contain 12 mg iron ferrous sulfate give 2 mg 57Fe 10mg 56Fe . The afternoon test meal contain 12 mg iron ferrous sulfate give 2 mg 58Fe 10 mg 56Fe . The test meal consist maize porridge ( 5-10 % dry weight ) mineral water ( 8ml ) randomly administer two alternate day ( AB BA ) . Overnight , breast milk allow infant come morning meal breast milk give least 3 h morning afternoon test meal administration . Infants allow eat drink 2 h test meal . Fourteen day second test meal administration , 3 ml whole blood collect venipuncture iron isotopic analysis iron inflammation status . Anthropometrics health status assess . Study 2 : At baseline blood sample collect potential study participant determination iron inflammation status parameter : hemoglobin ( Hb ) , hepcidin , plasma ferritin ( PF ) , soluble transferrin receptor ( sTfR ) , zinc protoporphyrin ( ZnPP ) , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , alpha-1-acid glycoprotein ( AGP ) . Anthropometrics ( height , weight , mid-upper arm head circumference ) measure , demographic , medical history feed habit assess use questionnaire . Infants randomize consume consecutive day alternate day meal schedule day 1 . 1ml blood collect second consecutive meal determine hepcidin level . Test meal A contain 12 mg iron ferrous sulfate give 2 mg 54Fe 10mg 56Fe . Test meal B contain 12 mg iron ferrous sulfate give 2 mg 57Fe 10mg 56Fe . Test meal C contain 12 mg iron ferrous sulfate give 2 mg 58Fe 10mg 56Fe . All test meal consume morning . The test meal consist maize porridge ( 5-10 % dry weight ) mineral water ( 8ml ) . Overnight , breast milk allow infant breast milk give least 3 h test meal administration . Test meal plus mineral water consume completely presence investigator , infant allow eat drink 2 h test meal . Fourteen day third test meal , 3 ml whole blood collect venipuncture iron inflammation status , iron analysis red blood cell .</detailed_description>
