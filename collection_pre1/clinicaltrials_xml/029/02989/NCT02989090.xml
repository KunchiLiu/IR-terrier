	<brief_summary>Remote monitoring implantable cardioverter-defibrillators ( ICDs ) patient lead efficient , safe , satisfy analysis device cardiac status ; result overall improvement quality care patient . Despite efficacy remote monitoring ICDs satisfaction patient provider process , desire patient access view ability data ICD transmitting . However , method make ICD device data directly available patient currently place . This study aim elicit impact standardized remote monitoring ICD data patient electronic personal health record ( ePHR ) patient engagement , healthcare utilization , patient-provider communication . For study , patient ICD manufacture St. Jude Medical undergoing remote monitor remote management system , Merlin.net™ , receive standardize format electronic remote monitoring ICD data MyChart , ePHR use Parkview Health . The standard format electronic remote monitoring ICD data , deliver patient , term ICD Patient Notification Summary . Additionally , provider attitude perception regard value Patient Notification Summary , impact clinic workflow , patient-provider communication collect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Electronic Patient Notification Remote ICD Data : Impact Patient Engagement Outcomes Merlin.Net™</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently , patient receive letter postal mail physician 's office statement ICD status . The St. Jude Medical ICD data manage Merlin.net™ remote monitoring system maintain database periodic transfer healthcare provider EHR system . This first large study evaluate impact transfer information ICD manufacturer 's remote monitoring system directly patient 's ePHR purpose make select information readily available patient form report , call ICD Patient Notification Summary . The ICD Patient Notification Summary transmit healthcare provider ' EHR system ( Epic ) Merlin.net™ part data flow pathway patient ' ePHR ( MyChart ) . This ensure Arrhythmia Diagnostic Center ( ADC ) clinic healthcare provider able view information patient receive . MATERIALS AND METHODS 1 ) SELECTION AND ENROLLMENT OF PATIENTS . Study Population : The study population comprise adult , ambulatory PPG-Cardiology patient remotely monitor St. Jude Medical ICD Merlin.net™ system . The study include three group ; one intervention group ( Group A ) two control group ( Group B Group C ) . Patients willing active MyChart account randomize one two group ( Group A Group B ) . Those patient initially decline MyChart account enrollment computer and/or Internet access enrol third group ( Group C ) . Each study group comprise approximately 100 patient total N=300 . The research staff identify patient satisfy inclusion/exclusion criterion study . c. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria : Inclusion Criteria 1 . 18 year age old 2 . Physically mentally capable provide informed consent 3 . Patient PPG-Cardiology 4 . Implanted St. Jude Medical ICD 5 . Undergoing remote monitoring Merlin.net™ system 6 . Ability read , write understand English 7 . Have access computer and/or Internet ( Group A B ) 8 . Patient schedule ICD download within study period time enrollment . Exclusion Criteria 1 . Does meet inclusion criterion 2 . Unable physically cognitively carry task necessary activate and/or utilizing ePHR ; blindness , loss function arm , cognitive impairment ( per chart review ) would interfere learn new task 3 . Designated part vulnerable subject population investigator designee identifies compromise autonomy relate potential study participation 4 . Currently participate another Parkview study involve ePHR use . Intervention Component i. Feasibility : The investigator assess intervention feasibility monitor successful delivery remote monitoring ICD data via ePHRs intervention group patient . ii . Data Collection : 1 . Group A- Intervention Group : Data include number ICD report Merlin.net™ ( per standard care ) study period number report process ADC . The number transmission ICD Patient Notification Summaries ePHR well number patient view ( electronic access ) provide Epic . Additional data may obtain MyChart regard patient ePHR usage include : 1 . Number successful ePHR logins 2 . Number unsuccessful ePHR logins 2 . Group B- Control Group : Data include number ICD report Merlin.net™ ( per standard care ) study period number report process ADC . Data also include number ICD Patient Notification Summaries mail participant research staff . Additional data may obtain MyChart regard patient ePHR usage include : 1 . Number successful ePHR logins 2 . Number unsuccessful ePHR logins 3 . Group C- Control Group : Data include number ICD report Merlin.net™ ( per standard care ) study period number report process ADC . The number ICD report provide ADC PPG-Cardiology . No data obtain MyChart patient either decline computer and/or Internet access active MyChart account . Quantitative Component . Patient Interaction : Baseline : Patients intervention group control group answer baseline survey . The baseline survey ass socio-demographic characteristic , patient engagement , patient satisfaction current standard care well patient perception receive remote monitoring ICD data ePHR . The survey administer either paper-based online , use secure online survey program , Survey Monkey . Patient engagement assess use short form Patient Activation Measure ( PAM ) survey copyright Insignia Health . The Patient Activation Measure ( PAM ) validate survey tool develop Judith Hibbard , PhD , MPH University Oregon , assess degree patient act active agent health care . PAM associate improved health outcomes6 . Follow-up : Patients respond two follow survey approximately 3 month 6 month baseline survey . The follow survey assess patient engagement , patient satisfaction perception ICD Patient Notification Summary current standard care well technology acceptance , depend group randomization . Technology acceptance assess use Technology Acceptance Model framework explore patient attitude regard ease use , usefulness intention use ePHR ICD Patient Notification Summary . The Technology Acceptance Model commonly use model , originally develop Fred Davis Richard Bagozzi , predict technology acceptance base user 's perceived usefulness perceive ease use technology specific purpose 7,8 . Data Collection : Chart review perform collect past current data regard patient 's socio-demographic characteristic , comorbidities , laboratory intervention , healthcare utilization . These data point help provide background descriptive information supplement component study . ICD-related data event well measurement classification clinic call assessed start six month prior study period continue throughout study period . The amount type healthcare utilization relation cardiac care collect . Data related use MyChart also collect . 2 ) SELECTION AND ENROLLMENT OF PROVIDERS 1 . Study Population : The study population comprise PPG-Cardiology provider involve care PPG-Cardiology patient undergoing remote monitoring St. Jude Medical ICD Merlin.net™ system . 2 . Sample Size : A convenience sample approximately 90-120 provider , include physician , nurse ADC technologist component study . 3 . Inclusion Criteria : Inclusion Criteria : 1 . 18 year age old 2 . Physically mentally capable provide informed consent 3 . Currently employee PPG-Cardiology 4 . Currently involve care patient ICDs undergoing remote monitoring 5 . Ability read , write understand English 3 ) PROVIDER STUDY DESIGN The provider survey administer via Survey Monkey evaluate provider ' attitude perception ICD Patient Notification Summary , include follow : - value ICD Patient Notification Summary patient - impact ICD Patient Notification Summary clinic workflow - effect ICD Patient Notification Summary patient-provider communication .</detailed_description>
