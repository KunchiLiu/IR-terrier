	<brief_title>MAGE-A10ᶜ⁷⁹⁶T Urothelial Cancer , Melanoma Head Neck Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 1 study design cell dose escalation trial evaluate safety MAGE A10ᶜ⁷⁹⁶T cell therapy subject inoperable metastatic urothelial cancer , melanoma head neck cancer . Anti-tumor activity exploratory objective assess . Subjects enter Screening Protocol ( ADP-0000-001 ) positive HLA-A2*02:01 and/or HLA-A*02:06 , negative HLA-A*02:05 , HLA-B*15:01 HLA-B*46:0 tumor express MAGE-A10 . The study enroll subject use modify 3+3 cell dose escalation design evaluate dose limit toxicity determine target cell dose range . Following dose escalation phase additional subject enrol 10 subject treat target cell dose range characterize safety , tolerability anti-tumor activity . Leukapheresis perform obtain cell manufacture autologous MAGE A10ᶜ⁷⁹⁶T cell . Leukapheresis perform soon possible subject determine eligible study participation . When manufactured MAGE A10ᶜ⁷⁹⁶T cell available , subject undergo lymphodepleting chemotherapy cyclophosphamide fludarabine follow infusion MAGE A10ᶜ⁷⁹⁶T Day 1 . Safety tolerability well anti-tumor activity biomarker assessment conduct multiple visit outline Schedule Procedures . Anti-tumor activity assess use RECIST v1.1 criterion week 6 , 12 , 18 24 month every 3 month year 2 every 6 month year 2-5 . In accordance FDA requirement gene therapy clinical trial , long term monitoring subject gene therapy relate delayed adverse event ( Long term follow-up , LTFU ) continue 15 year T cell infusion . Subjects study enroll long term follow study safety assessment . All subject continue follow overall survival LTFU phase .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>A subject must meet follow inclusion criterion eligible participation study : 1 . Subject ( legally authorize representative ) voluntarily agree participate give write informed consent ( assent applicable ) accordance ICH GCP guideline applicable local regulation . 2 . Subject agree abide protocol require procedure include study related assessment , management treat institution duration study long term followup . 3 . Subject ≥ 18 year age time sign study inform consent . 4 . Subject histologically confirm diagnosis one follow cancer : ( A ) urothelial cancer ( transitional cell cancer bladder , ureter renal pelvis ) , ( B ) melanoma , ( C ) squamous cell carcinoma head neck . 5 . Subject measurable disease accord RECIST 1.1 criterion study entry . 6 . Subject follow disease specific requirement tumor type : Inoperable metastatic ( advanced ) urothelial cancer Has receive platinum contain regimen adjuvant metastatic setting ineligible , refuse platinum part prior chemotherapy regimen ; may receive prior immunotherapy . Inoperable metastatic ( advanced ) melanoma Has receive PD1 inhibitor and/or CTLA4 inhibitor . Has receive BRAF inhibitor combination BRAF MEK inhibitor BRAFv600 mutant melanoma . Inoperable metastatic ( advanced ) squamous cell head neck cancer May receive platinum contain chemotherapy treatment primary tumor adjuvant metastatic setting refuse treatment . May receive prior immunotherapy . 7 . Subject HLAA*02:01 and/or HLAA*02:06 positive . ( This determination make screen protocol ADP0000001 ) . 8 . Subject 's tumor ( either archival specimen fresh biopsy ) show positive MAGEA10 expression . The threshold requirement MAGEA10 expression IHC define Study Procedures Manual . All sample must pathologically review Adaptimmune designated central laboratory confirm expression . ( This determination make screen protocol ADP0000001 ) . 9 . Subject anticipated life expectancy &gt; 3 month 10 . Subject ECOG Performance Status 01 . 11 . Subject leave ventricular ejection fraction ≥50 % . 12 . Subject fit leukapheresis adequate venous access cell collection . 13 . Female subject childbearing potential ( FCBP ) must negative urine serum pregnancy test . NOTE : FCBP define premenopausal surgically sterilize . FCBP must agree use maximally effective birth control abstain heterosexual activity throughout study , start first dose chemotherapy 12 month receive investigational product , 4 month evidence persistence/gene modify cell subject 's blood , whichever longer . Adequate contraceptive method female include : intrauterine device , injectable hormonal contraception , oral contraception , 2 adequate barrier method ( e.g . diaphragm spermicide , cervical cap spermicide , female condom spermicide spermicides alone adequate method contraception ) . Or Male subject must surgically sterile agree use double barrier contraception method abstain heterosexual activity female childbearing potential start first dose chemotherapy 4 month thereafter . Subject must adequate organ function indicate laboratory value table : Absolute Neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.0 x10⁹/L ( without GCSF support ) Platelets ≥ 75 x10⁹/L Hemoglobin &gt; 80 g/L ( without transfusion support within 7 day prior leukapheresis ) Prothrombin Time INR ≤ 1.5x upper limit normal ( ULN ) unless receive therapeutic anticoagulation . Partial Thromboplastin Time ( PTT ) ≤ 1.5x upper limit normal ( ULN ) unless receive therapeutic anticoagulation . Calculated measured creatinine clearance ≥ 40 mL/min Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN ( unless subject document Gilbert 's Syndrome ) Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) /Serum Glutamic Pyruvic Transaminase ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5x ULN A subject meeting follow criterion eligible participation study : 1 . Subject HLAA*02:05 , HLAB*15:01 and/or HLAB*46:01 positive . 2 . Subject receive plan receive exclude therapy/treatment prior leukapheresis lymphodepleting chemotherapy ( see protocol ) 3 . Subject toxicity previous anticancer therapy must recover ≤ Grade 1 prior enrollment ( except nonclinically significant toxicity , e.g. , alopecia , vitiligo ) . Subjects Grade 2 toxicity deem stable irreversible e.g . peripheral neuropathy ) enrol . 4 . Subject history allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition fludarabine , cyclophosphamide agent use study . 5 . Subject history chronic recurrent ( within last year prior screen ) severe autoimmune immune mediate disease require steroid immunosuppressive treatment . 6 . Subject major surgery within 4 week prior lymphodepletion ; subject fully recover surgical related toxicity . 7 . Subject know active brain leptomeningeal metastasis . Subjects prior history brain metastasis undergone local therapy ( i.e. , metastatectomy and/or radiation ) show evidence local recurrence progression past 3 month prior Screening eligible . 8 . Subject active malignancy besides tumor study within 3 year prior Screening . Exceptions : adequately treat malignancy likely require therapy ( e.g. , completely resect nonmelanomatous skin carcinoma successfully treat situ carcinoma ) .
