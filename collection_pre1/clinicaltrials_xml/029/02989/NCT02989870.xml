	<brief_summary>This study involve course radiation 5 tumor participant 's liver follow systemic therapy . ( Treatment use substance travel bloodstream , reach affect cell body . ) The type radiation call stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) . The purpose study compare effect , good and/or bad , different dos SBRT give along systemic therapy , sorafenib bavituximab . The researcher want see dose radiation work best stimulate immune response provide local control participant 's liver . The usual treatment hepatocellular carcinoma unresectable transarterial therapy , sorafenib alone and/or clinical trial .</brief_summary>
