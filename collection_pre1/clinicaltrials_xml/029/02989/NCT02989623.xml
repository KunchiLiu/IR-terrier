	<brief_summary>This pilot phase I trial study well copper Cu 64 TP3805 positron emission tomography ( PET ) work detect prostate cancer patient persistently elevate prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) . The copper Cu 64 TP3805 PET scan us copper Cu 64 TP3805 , compound make radioactive agent attach molecule look like hormone bind cancer cell detect prostate cancer PET scan . Copper Cu 64 TP3805 PET may able see tumor earlier stage standard care .</brief_summary>
