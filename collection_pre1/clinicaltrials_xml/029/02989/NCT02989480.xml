	<brief_summary>Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy ( ARVC ) rare condition heart muscle cell especially main pump chamber ( 'ventricle ' ) replace fat scar tissue . Sarcoidosis condition affect many organ affect heart patch inflammation result scarring , especially ventricle . Both condition cause dangerous heart rhythms sudden death . Sarcoidosis treat inflammation suppress treatment ( steroid ) , well pacemaker implantable defibrillator shock heart back normal rhythm . ARVC usually treat implantable defibrillator . The diagnosis either condition difficult indeed distinguish two extremely challenge . Increasingly nuclear scan ( PET ) use identify inflammation heart patient suspect cardiac sarcoid . It know whether patient ARVC abnormal PET scan .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy ( ARVC ) rare inherit condition characterise pathologically fibro-fatty replacement myocytes usually ( exclusively ) within right ventricle . The clinical consequence process usually re-entrant ventricular arrhythmia may fatal ARVC consequently third common cause sudden cardiac death young . Diagnosis involve image , electrocardiography , myocardial biopsy genetic testing . Task Force criterion diagnosis establish . Nevertheless condition difficult diagnose ( exclude ) , especially less advanced disease , common scenario individual family member suffer condition . To complicate situation , others publish recent report suggest infiltrative condition within heart especially sarcoidosis , may fulfil Task Force criterion , lead false positive diagnosis . This particular concern since natural history treatment option condition different . Sarcoidosis granulomatous disorder unknown cause , predominantly affect lung , reticuloendothelial system skin . Cardiac involvement autopsy find 25 % affected individual although clinical manifestation present approximately 5 % . Isolated cardiac sarcoidosis , without manifestation system rare . The non-caseating granuloma frequently infiltrate leave ventricular &amp; septal myocardium although right ventricular involvement also occur . Granulomas result scar formation cause conduction disturbance , cardiac failure ventricular arrhythmia . Sudden death uncommon . Myocardial biopsy confirm diagnosis patchy nature granulomatous process , test positive 50 % affected individual . Other investigation use help make support diagnosis include echocardiography , MRI , electrocardiography , PET , corroborate evidence high resolution CT chest skin biopsy . However , image finding may lack specificity precise aetiology . Cardiac MRI identifies area myocardial scar fibrosis , final step disease process . Although patterns fibrosis well describe ARVC cardiac sarcoidosis , significant overlap exist two disease regard exact location fibrosis : example ARVC affect either ventricle . Typically , although affect predominantly RV , advance stage also well described pattern mid-wall patchy fibrosis basal infero-lateral wall leave ventricle sometimes inter-ventricular septum . Conversely , sarcoidosis typically affect LV , fibrosis find , location septal infero-lateral territory . In sarcoid , RV enlargement occur either due granulomatous involvement within RV myocardium , secondary pulmonary hypertension associate lung involvement . Cases sarcoidosis RV involve may difficult diagnose : The RV enlargement reduction function overlap significantly Task Force Criteria CMR diagnosis ARVC , furthermore , pattern late gadolinium enhancement sufficiently specific guide diagnosis either ARVC Cardiac Sarcoid RV involvement .</detailed_description>
