	<brief_title>Melancholic Symptoms Bipolar Depression Responsiveness Lamotrigine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients suffer depression melancholic symptom ( i.e. , anhedonia , flat affect , diurnal mood variation , terminal insomnia , psychomotor disturbance , decrease weight/appetite , excessive guilt ) respond well certain antidepressant . Melancholic symptom also occur bipolar depression , although receive less research . Lamotrigine show alter biological process know occur melancholic depression . The purpose study determine patient melancholic bipolar II depression responsive lamotrigine patient non-melancholic bipolar II depression . This study re-analyze data previous 8-week , randomize , placebo-controlled trial evaluate lamotrigine treatment bipolar II depression ( GSK-SCA100223 ; NCT00274677 ) . The original study data make available GlaxoSmithKline part initiative make clinical trial data available research use . Access apply via http : //www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com . The analysis strategy comparable original study , although investigator first classify participant suffer either melancholic non-melancholic depression . The diagnosis melancholic depression establish accord baseline response Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HAMD-17 ) Montgomery-Ã…sberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) , accord DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criterion . HAMD-17 MADRS change score compare treatment placebo group use Analysis Covariance ( ANCOVA ) . Both ANCOVA model include test interaction treatment group ( lamotrigine vs. placebo ) melancholic depression ( melancholic depression vs. non-melancholic depression ) . To handle miss data , ANCOVA model compute complete-case data first subsequently use inverse probability weight account probability drop . Inverse probability weight create base covariates predict miss response . HAMD-17 MADRS response rate treatment placebo group evaluate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis . There two separate analysis , one include participant melancholic depression , one include participant non-melancholic depression . Statistical model also adjust baseline depression severity , participant melancholic depression find severe depressive symptom baseline . Given delay antidepressant initiation response , trial-and-error prescribing inevitably lengthy process . The investigator hope result study enable timely effective treatment patient bipolar depression .</detailed_description>
