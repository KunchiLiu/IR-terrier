	<brief_summary>Rationale : Fluid overload common complication child admit pediatric intensive care mechanical ventilation . Acute lung infection frequent cause admission PICU form uniform group single organ failure . In critically ill child , fluid overload associate adverse outcome . Restricting volume fluid already early stage ICU admission may prevent fluid overload mechanical ventilation thus improve clinical outcome . However , time fluid restriction may interfere appropriate energy macronutrient intake need recovery . Objective : The main goal pilot study evaluate feasibility restrictive fluid management protocol investigate effect occurrence fluid overload mechanically ventilated child acute infectious lung disease . Study design : Single-center prospective randomize feasibility pilot study preparation multi-center randomize control trial ( RCT ) . Study population : Mechanically ventilated child ( suspicion ) acute infectious lung disease admit pediatric intensive care unit ( PICU ) Emma Children 's Hospital , Academic Medical Center , Amsterdam . Intervention : Patients receive either liberal ( control group ) restrictive ( experimental group ) fluid treatment , ensure appropriate caloric intake . Main study parameters/endpoints : Primary outcome cumulative fluid balance body weight first week mechanical ventilation . Secondary outcome ( preparation large multi-center RCT ) include : mortality , duration mechanical ventilation oxygenation index . To determine feasibility , in- exclusion rate , adherence treatment arm , need fluid bolus , need diuretic hemodynamic index well energy protein intake study . Both fluid management protocol reflect variant current clinical practice , hence provide extra burden risk patient include study . Patients randomize either fluid protocol arm admission PICU ( start mechanical ventilation ) . Patients include restrictive fluid treatment arm might direct benefit study indeed fluid overload less common group .</brief_summary>
