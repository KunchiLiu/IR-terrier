	<brief_summary>Sickle cell disease ( SCD ) one common genetic disease world . In North America , estimate 2600 baby bear SCD year1 , approximately 70,000 100,000 individual age affect United States2 . The clinical manifestation SCD include acute event , recurrent debilitate painful crisis , well life-threatening pulmonary , cardiovascular , renal , neurologic complication . The established curative treatment SCD patient allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( HSCT ) . Unfortunately , access intervention limit availability suitable matched donor , HSCT associate significant morbidity mortality . For patient undergo HSCT , treatment SCD limit one FDA-approved medication , hydroxyurea , supportive symptomatic care . After decade novel therapeutic option SCD patient , autologous cell-based genetic therapy , include lentiviral-based gene therapy well gene editing , offer possibility innovative curative approach patient lack match donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . Gene therapy sickle cell disease increasingly promising , currently open clinical trial several center employ gene addition strategy . Options autologous HSC collection include bone marrow harvest peripheral blood HSC mobilization . Bone marrow ( BM ) harvest invasive procedure require anesthesia , associate sickle cell-related morbidity , may achieve goal CD34+ cell dose , necessitate repeat procedure schedule multiple month . In gene therapy trial , HSCs obtain peripheral collection mobilization granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) follow peripheral blood ( PB ) apheresis . However , approach contraindicate SCD G-CSF report cause severe adverse effect sickle cell patient . Even dose sometimes small standard , G-CSF show result vaso-occlusive crisis , severe acute chest syndrome , one report , massive splenomegaly death . Alternative option mobilization need . Plerixafor compare G-CSF sickle cell mouse model , result show effective mobilization HSC subset , without neutrophil endothelial activation , low total WBC neutrophil count compare G-CSF-treated mouse . Plerixafor use yet document sickle cell patient . One trial currently open test plerixafor SCD patient ( NCT02193191 ) result yet report . Based pre-clinical data , mechanism action plerixafor , well strategy investigator employ mitigate risk , investigator anticipate well-tolerated SCD patient population .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Feasibility Trial Plerixafor Hematopoietic Stem Cell ( HSC ) Mobilization Patients With Sickle Cell Disease Pilot Feasibility Trial Plerixafor Hematopoietic Stem Cell ( HSC ) Mobilization Patients With Sickle Cell Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This non-randomized pilot safety feasibility single-center study treat subject SCD plerixafor , follow collection peripheral HSPCs apheresis . Accrual sample 6 patient , least three patient treat plerixafor dose 180 mcg/kg , potential escalation dose 240 mcg/kg accord safety tolerability low dose . Three patient treat low dose 180 mcg/kg . If none patient experience dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) , next three patient treat high dose 240 mcg/kg . If one patient treat 240 mcg/kg DLT , 180 mcg/kg select safe dose level . If patient 240 mcg/kg DLT , 240 mcg/kg select safe dose level . Within 30 day prior plerixafor administration , subject undergo laboratory testing , history , physical exam . In order retain possibility subject use his/her autologous cell future therapeutic indication , infectious disease test suitability autologous transplant assess per autologous transplant routine procedure . If subject take hydroxyurea , medication stop 14 day prior plan apheresis . Between Days -7 -2 prior apheresis , subject undergo exchange transfusion . This transfusion time accordance patient 's exist chronic transfusion regimen . An exchange transfusion perform post-transfusion hemoglobin electrophoresis confirm % HbS &lt; /= 30 % . After exchange transfusion bone marrow aspirate perform local anesthesia conscious sedation . The reason perform pre-plerixafor bone marrow addition primary objective assess safety feasibility plerixafor SCD patient , investigator also aim increase knowledge HSPCs bone marrow niche SCD patient - relevant well understanding basic disease pathophysiology , also possible future use BM HSPCs ( obtain basal condition plerixafor administration ) gene therapy gene edit therapy . It important compare phenotypic feature BM-derived cell versus plerixafor-derived cell . Additionally however , order also understand whether HSPCs SCD patient differ substantially healthy donor , pre-plerixafor baseline sample HSPCs SCD subject provide important biological information well . On Day -1 , subject admit Hematology service Boston Children 's Hospital . Confirmation available , compatible unit pack red blood cell confirm prior administration plerixafor ( use case unexpected acute clinical need transfusion ) . Labs drawn , include CBC , differential , hemoglobin electrophoresis , type screen , peripheral CD34+ cell count . The subject receive single dose subcutaneous plerixafor . On Day 0 , prior apheresis , labs drawn , include CBC , differential , peripheral CD34+ count . Starting 6 hour plerixafor dose , apheresis perform collect 3-5x blood volume . If subject already central venous access , access apheresis obtain peripherally use 2 large bore 16g needle , blood process cell separator . Blood within instrument receive acid citrate dextrose formula A ( ACD-A ) ( 3 % ) rate 1 mL/min/L total blood volume , standard apheresis dose . 2 gram calcium gluconate infuse course procedure prevent hypocalcemia associate citrate administration . A CBC drawn end procedure . Vital sign monitor every 15 minute instrument . A second bone marrow aspirate perform apheresis . The subject remain admitted Hematology service overnight . If excess cellular material collect , portion collect apheresis product ( minimum 1 x 106 maximum 3 x 106 unmanipulated CD34+ cells/kg ) store clinically compliant condition possible future use patient . On Day + 1 apheresis , labs drawn include CBC , differential , peripheral CD34+ count . The subject discharge Hematology service unless subject meet standard clinical discharge criterion . On Day + 2 apheresis , study team communicate subject via phone inquire symptom experience . On Days +3 , +7 , +14 , subject return outpatient visit lab .</detailed_description>
