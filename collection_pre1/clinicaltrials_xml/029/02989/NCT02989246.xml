	<brief_summary>This pilot study test feasibility use computerized ventilator management protocol seek encourage lung protective ventilation acute phase ventilation , esophageal manometry base titration ventilator setting wean phase ventilation , child acute respiratory failure . The investigator hypothesize approach reduce time mechanical ventilation , largely preserve diaphragm muscle function .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives : This pilot study help refine computer base ventilator management protocol use acute weaning phase ventilation child acute respiratory failure . The acute phase protocol adaptation Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Network protocol pediatrics , wean phase involve esophageal manometry guide wean protocol base effort breathe . The investigator seek test safety feasibility protocol recommendation software system , help determine potential effect size intervention determine feasibility randomize control trial . They also seek determine feasibility reproducibility serial diaphragm ultrasound measurement mechanically ventilated child . Study Population : All child intubate mechanically ventilated Children 's Hospital Los Angeles Pediatric ICU anticipate length intubation &gt; 48 hour eligible , exclusion criterion base ability perform measurement . Study methodology : After consent , esophageal catheter place . A software management tool ventilator management place bedside enrolled patient , recommendation regard change ventilator support provide clinician every several hour acute wean phase . When ventilator support threshold , recommendation make perform spontaneous breathe trial . The clinician ultimately decide whether accept reject recommendation , evaluate patient potential change ventilator . The acceptance rejection recommendation track , use refine intervention . Daily diaphragm ultrasound measurement also obtain monitor diaphragm thickness contractile activity . Follow : Clinical outcome follow ICU include re-intubation , medication administer , ICU length stay . No follow ICU discharge plan . Analysis plan : Data use refine intervention , test acceptability protocol recommendation bedside provider , determine sample size estimate follow randomize controlled trial . These analysis descriptive . A pilot 40 patient anticipate .</detailed_description>
