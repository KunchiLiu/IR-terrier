	<brief_summary>This single arm , multi-site phase Ib/II clinical trial standard dose High Dose Interleukin-2 ( HD IL2 ) ( 600,000 IU/kg/dose intravenously two 5-day cycle 9 day apart ) IL-2 eligible clear cell metastatic RCC ( Renal Cell Carcinoma ) subject combination Nivolumab . Investigators hypothesize concurrent PD-1 inhibition synergistically enhance anti-tumor immune response HD IL-2 metastatic clear cell RCC . Investigators postulate combination two therapy would result increase overall response rate , complete response rate , improve survival outcome compare either individual therapy .</brief_summary>
