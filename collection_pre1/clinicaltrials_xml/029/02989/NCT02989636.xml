	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect nivolumab without stereotactic radiosurgery treat patient chordoma come back spread start place body . Monoclonal antibody , nivolumab , may interfere ability tumor cell grow spread . Stereotactic radiosurgery specialize radiation therapy delivers single , high dose radiation directly tumor may cause less damage normal tissue . It yet know whether give nivolumab without stereotactic radiosurgery may work well treat patient chordoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nivolumab With Without Stereotactic Radiosurgery Treating Patients With Recurrent , Advanced , Metastatic Chordoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety profile nivolumab alone nivolumab combination stereotactic radiosurgery treat patient recurrent advanced chordoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate toxicity tolerability nivolumab alone nivolumab combination stereotactic radiosurgery . II . To estimate growth modulation index target lesion . III . To estimate clinical response ( partial response [ PR ] + complete response [ CR ] within 6 month + stable disease [ SD ] beyond 6 month ) . IV . To assess progression-free survival progression-free survival ( PFS ) rate 6 month . V. To assess overall survival rate 1 year , 3 year 5 year . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To explore peripheral blood immune response treatment . OUTLINE : Patients assign 1 2 arm . ARM I : Patients receive nivolumab intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 14 day 2 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive nivolumab Arm I . Patients undergo stereotactic radiosurgery ( SRS ) per standard care day 8 course 1 . After completion study treatment , patient follow 100 day every 10 week thereafter .</detailed_description>
