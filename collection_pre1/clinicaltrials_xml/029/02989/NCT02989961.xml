	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Resticutis Compared Platelet-Rich Plasma Treating Diabetic Foot Ulcers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Grade II III ( According Wagner 's classification system Ulcer severity ) consider common complication associate Diabetes , mostly hard heal use conventional treatment method consequence severely affect quality lifestyle diabetes patient . It 's think application Autologous activate platelet `` Resticutis '' secrete huge amount growth factor capable give good result : stimulation heal process include contraction , granulation , tissue formation epithelialization diabetic foot ulcer . Resticutis obtain autologous 20 mL peripheral blood withdrawn tube contain 3.8 % Sodium Citrate . Blood centrifuge obtain Platelet-Rich Plasma -PRP- per establish method . PRP activate closed system physical method obtain final product 5 mL Resticutis inject intra-lesional ulcer margin per session therapy . It 's hypothesize total six injection throughout period treatment enough achieve full closure DFU . The injection give day : 0,14,28,42,56 , 70 treatment period . The total number consent patient study calculated use standard statistical design patient randomize 3 group : One group give Resticutis , second one Platelet-Rich Plasma PRP , third Platelet-Poor Plasma PPP . If patient PRP PPP group n't achieve full healing six injection , 're give two week rest give Resticutis instead . AutoCAD Program use measure ulcer area scale data analyze use Statistical Packages Social Sciences ( SPSS ) .</detailed_description>
