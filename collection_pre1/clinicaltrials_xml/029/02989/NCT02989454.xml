	<brief_summary>Acute stress induce ( Tako-tsubo ) cardiomyopathy ( TTC ) break heart syndrome , condition typically occur acute stress death rate similar heart attack frequently associate long-term symptom ( fatigue exercise limitation ) . There effective therapy . The investigator recently show profound shortage energy heart Tako Tsubo Cardiomyopathy patient day acute presentation partial recovery four month . The investigator would like establish whether recovers least one year , persists , also investigate mechanism responsible exercise limitation recovery acute phase .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Persistent Symptoms Early Incomplete Recovery After Acute Stress-induced Cardiomyopathy : Is There Ongoing Heart Distress ? The HEROIC Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tako Tsubo Cardiomyopathy present sudden onset chest pain mimic myocardial infarction ( MI ) precipitate major emotional/physical stress . Classically , coronary artery normal yet , leave ventricular ( LV ) angiogram show characteristic , extensive severe wall motion abnormality , develop cardiogenic shock , cardiac rupture embolic stroke . In week follow onset , wall motion abnormality gradually recover : lead assumption Tako Tsubo Cardiomyopathy self-limiting , reinforce absence myocardial damage cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging . However , investigator others show Tako Tsubo Cardiomyopathy recovery rapid , characterise severe global oedema , persist 3-4 month presentation . The investigator show profound decrease cardiac energetics acute Tako Tsubo Cardiomyopathy phase compare healthy control . This improved significantly follow remain reduced compare healthy control . These objective finding incompletely resolve myocardial oedema energetic impairment contrast rapid apparent recovery Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction keep persistence symptom previously report literature investigator ' clinical observation Tako Tsubo Cardiomyopathy follow-up clinic institution . The persistence symptom ( fatigue , recurrent chest pain , decrease exercise capacity ) could due either : 1 . Subclinical degree impairment cardiac energetics/function ( reflect either even prolong status incomplete recovery pre-existent cardiomyopathy ) despite normalise almost normalised ejection fraction rest result cardiac limitation exercise , 2 . Physical deconditioning acute , severe illness .</detailed_description>
