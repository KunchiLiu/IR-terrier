	<brief_summary>Patients kidney , renal , failure require life-saving treatment regular dialysis . Dialysis form treatment simulate kidney function ; remove harmful waste product extra water blood . Almost one-third people kidney failure also diabetes , diabetes one leading cause kidney disease United Kingdom , usually due poor blood sugar control long period time . Malnutrition common patient needing dialysis due kidney failure cause fatigue , taste change build waste product , reduce appetite . Treatment malnutrition involve increase energy protein intake food drink , milk-drink style specialist nutrition drink often give dialysis patient due specific dietary need . These nutrition drink increase blood sugar level optimal control diabetes may difficult . This research study aim measure blood sugar response `` slow-release '' sugar nutrition drink specifically design dialysis patient , may result low blood sugar level , compare standard nutrition drink , consume dialysis session . 28 patient diabetes regular dialysis treatment enrol study . Patients ask drink 1 3 different nutrition drink , week 3 week regular dialysis treatment . Blood sugar level measure blood sample take patient 's circulation directly enter dialysis machine 3 hour maximum blood sugar read total blood sugar response measure . Differences 3 drink test statistically . The result help advise patient diabetes kidney failure suitable type nutrition drink consume dialysis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Glycaemic Response Oral Nutrition Support During Haemodialysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients end stage kidney disease require dialysis high risk cardiovascular disease , many dialysis population also diabetes . Malnutrition common patient undergoing dialysis cause multifactorial . Oral nutrition support first line treatment malnutrition , often include use liquid nutrition supplement , especially dialysis patient due already restrict diet require maintain electrolyte balance . Oral nutrition supplement ( ONS ) raise serum blood glucose level optimal control diabetes may difficult ONS require . This study aim evaluate post-prandial response newly re-formulated slow release carbohydrate renal specific oral nutrition supplement , compare standard macro-nutrient match ONS product , haemodialysis , use randomise cross-over trial design . 28 patient diabetes end stage kidney disease undergoing haemodialysis recruit study , include 8 pilot phase 20 study . Patients randomise crossover design 3 study treatment 3 week - slow release CHO ONS , macronutrient match ONS , standard ONS . Central blood glucose level measure 3 hour peak mean incremental area curve ( iAUC ) post prandial blood glucose response calculate study treatment . Differences treatment determine repeated measure analysis co-variance ( ANCOVA ) . The acute effect different nutritional supplement blood glucose discuss context maintain optimal blood glucose control dialysis .</detailed_description>
