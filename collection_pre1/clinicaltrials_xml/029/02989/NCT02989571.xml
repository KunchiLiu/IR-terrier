	<brief_title>The Effects Increased IV Hydration Nulliparous Women Undergoing Induction Labor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Exercise physiology show increased fluid intake replacement improve skeletal muscle performance prolong exercise . Labor physically demand process essentially `` exercise '' uterus , uterine contraction vary strength dilation lead thin dilation cervix eventual delivery infant . It logically theorize , exercise , improve hydration delivery carbohydrates uterine smooth muscle help optimize contraction need labor . Conversely , dehydration believe result decrease uterine perfusion ( due decrease intravascular volume ) , also reduce delivery nutrient elimination waste product contract myometrium . Inadequate maternal hydration postulate contribute factor prolong dysfunctional labor , uterine contraction sufficiently strong inappropriately coordinate cause adequate cervical dilation effacement . Even patient completely dilate , sufficient voluntary involuntary muscle effort require second stage labor achieve vaginal delivery . Prolonged labor lead increase hospitalization cost , also increase risk cesarean delivery indication `` failure progress , '' chorioamnionitis ( intrauterine infection ) , postpartum hemorrhage . Establishing technique optimize length duration labor therefore area particular research interest . To date , several randomize , control study demonstrate higher intravenous ( IV ) fluid rate , decreased frequency prolong labor possibly decrease need oxytocin patient present active labor . One study perform Long Beach Memorial Garite et al IRB approval supervision . Importantly , systematic review study Cochrane Collaboration 2013 demonstrate increase intravenous fluid rate ( 250mL/hr vs 125mL/hr ) appear shorten time delivery cesarean delivery rate patient present active labor . The rate induction labor increase dramatically recent year , 9.5 % 1990 22.1 % 2004 . Women undergo induction labor ( whether elective medically indicate ) represent distinct population present active labor , regard baseline characteristic , also regard labor course maternal neonatal outcome . There study thus far investigate use increase intravenous hydration patient undergoing induction labor , previous study focus patient present active labor . The objective study therefore determine effect increase intravenous hydration nulliparous patient undergo induction labor length labor , mode delivery , maternal neonatal outcome .</detailed_description>
