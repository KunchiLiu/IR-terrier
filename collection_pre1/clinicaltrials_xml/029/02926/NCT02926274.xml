	<brief_summary>Massive hemorrhage major cause potentially preventable death follow trauma . A common consequence hemorrhagic shock uncontrollable bleeding coagulopathy , lead death exsanguination . Even bleed control , patient increase risk complication mortality . Reconstituted whole blood , component therapy pack red blood cell ( PRBCs ) , plasma , platelet introduce military recent conflict Iraq Afghanistan remarkable result adopt civilian trauma center . Despite improve coagulopathy , apparent transfusion blood component equivalent whole blood transfusion . Transfusion high plasma volume may associate increase risk allergic reaction , transfusion associate acute lung injury ( TRALI ) , hypervolemic cardiac failure , acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) . Military service recently reintroduce fresh whole blood ( FWB ) standard resuscitation massive hemorrhage , find FWB offer survival advantage component therapy , risk transfusion reaction similar FWB PRBCs . On civilian side , whole blood FDA-licensed product use pediatric open heart surgery autologous blood donation longer commonly available indication . However , military result renew interest whole blood trauma resuscitation . The use low-antibody titer whole blood leukoreduced platelet-sparing filter recently approve University California Los Angeles Blood Blood Derivatives Committee two trauma center male trauma patient . This study test feasibility provide FWB resuscitation patient hemorrhagic shock determine effect FWB clinical outcome well effect coagulation , fibrinolysis , inflammation , compare standard blood component therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Most current massive transfusion protocol attempt treat early coagulopathic state induce severe injury hemorrhagic shock transfusion red blood cell , plasma , platelets 1:1:1 ratio replicate whole blood . Civilian trauma center begin initiate resuscitation adult male patient store whole blood standard care , however . The main hypothesis behind change practice transfusion fresh whole blood ( FWB ) rather attempted reconstitution bank component safer , efficient effective treatment hemorrhagic shock follow injury result le frequent development clinical coagulopathy subsequent mortality . Whole blood offer advantage precisely approximate shed blood ; decrease volume additive per unit ; exposure decrease number donor patient undergoing massive transfusion . It remain see whether translate difference coagulopathy , inflammation , mortality . The purpose study investigate feasibility develop system collect , store , deliver whole blood trauma resuscitation civilian trauma center . The universal donor blood type patient unknown blood type type O positive blood male O negative female . Because O negative blood rare study initiate change practice adult male patient later extend female patient feasible . The study determine effect FWB transfusion adult male patient compare transfusion PRBCS , plasma , platelets 1:1:1 ratio non adult male patient marker coagulation , fibrinolysis , inflammation , well development complication hospital mortality follow severe injury . Specific aim : 1 . Determine appropriate shelf life FWB leukoreduced platelet spar filter measure change level coagulation factor global clot potential bank unit time . To accomplish investigator measure variable know reflect potential actual clotting capacity include platelet function overall clotting ability thromboelastography ( TEG ) thrombin generation analysis whole blood 35 day . 2 . Prospectively determine effectiveness trauma resuscitation use FWB compare component therapy effect variable know reflect potential actual clotting capacity include marker coagulation , fibrinolysis , inflammation , platelet function global hemostatic potential post transfusion , well hospital outcome include development coagulopathy , infection , venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) , multiple organ failure ( MOF ) , total transfusion requirement , mortality . 3 . Test feasibility implementation system provide FWB resuscitation trauma patient hemorrhagic shock civilian trauma center . This accomplish monitoring cost , storage need , frequency blood collection , number donor , inventory , utilization wastage unused unit .</detailed_description>
