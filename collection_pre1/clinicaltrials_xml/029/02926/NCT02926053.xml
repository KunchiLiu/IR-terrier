	<detailed_description>Adoptive T cell therapy ( ACT ) tumor infiltrate lymphocyte ( TIL ) achieve impressive clinical result durable complete response patient metastatic melanoma . The TILs isolate patient tumor tissue follow vitro expansion activation around 4-6 week . Before TIL infusion patient receive 1 week precondition chemotherapy cyclophosphamide fludarabine . After TIL infusion Interleukin-2 administer support T cell activation proliferation vivo . Objectives : To evaluate safety feasibility treat patient metastatic renal cell carcinoma ACT TILs . To evaluate treatment relate immune response . To evaluate clinical efficacy . Design : Patients screen physical exam , medical history , blood sample , pulmonary function test , Cr-EDTA clearance , MUGA scan ECG . Patients undergo surgery harvest tumor material TIL production . Patients admit day -8 order undergo lymphodepleting chemotherapy cyclophosphamide fludara start day -7 . On day 0 patient receive TIL infusion shortly start IL-2 administration high-dose bolus IL-2 every eight hour 5 day ( maximum 15 dos ) . The patient follow progression 5 year .</detailed_description>
