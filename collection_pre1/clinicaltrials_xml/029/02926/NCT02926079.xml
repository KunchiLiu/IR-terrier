	<detailed_description>This translational research study obtain paired measure metabolic flexibility ( postprandial RQ minus basal RQ ) response standardize meal indirect calorimetry mother : infant dyads diabetic non-diabetic pregnancy . The downstream effect intrauterine exposure diabetes gestational lipotoxicity test infant : 1 ) birth study adipogenic pathway mitochondrial function umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell culture myogenic condition [ 13 ] , 2 ) study metabolic flexibility infant whole body infant calorimeter response standardize meal . Mothers enrol ( 33-35 week gestation ) infant enrol 10-30 day life follow aim . Aim 1 . Characterize metabolic flexibility lipotoxicity diabetic non-diabetic pregnancy . Hypothesis 1A : In response standardized meal late pregnancy , diabetic pregnancy metabolically inflexible ( blunted switch RQ fast state postprandial state ) compare non-diabetic pregnancy match maternal age pregravid BMI . Hypothesis 1B : Placenta diabetic pregnancy higher lipid content , reduce mitochondrial content low rate mitochondrial oxygen consumption compare placenta non-diabetic pregnancy . Aim 2 . Test whether intrauterine exposure maternal diabetes infers disorder substrate oxidation offspring birth ( myocytes culture umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell ) early postnatal life ( metabolic flexibility response standardize meal ) . Hypothesis 2A : Umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell culture myogenic condition diabetic pregnancy great lipid content , reduce mitochondrial content , low rate mitochondrial electron transport oxygen consumption fatty acid oxidation . Hypothesis 2B : In response standardized meal , offspring diabetic pregnancy metabolically inflexible ( blunted switch RQ pre- postprandial state ) compare offspring non-diabetic pregnancy .</detailed_description>
