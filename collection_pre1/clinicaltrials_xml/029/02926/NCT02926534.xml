	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess prevalence COPD among individual age 35 - 59 year base result spirometry bronchodilator , presence structural change lung ( emphysema , inflammatory change thicken wall large small airway ) detect computer tomography well symptoms COPD . The study three study group : smoker conventional cigarette ; quit smoke 1 - 5 year ago , n't smoke cigarette .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cross-Sectional Study COPD Prevalence Among Smokers , Ex-smokers Never-Smokers Almaty , Kazakhstan</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) fourth lead cause death worldwide . An estimated 0.5 million individual Kazakhstan may affect COPD , number affected individual death COPD expect increase population age . A good understanding epidemiology , cause , social determinant disease need order develop effective treatment prevention strategy . Although COPD traditionally define airflow obstruction spirometry test , smoking-associated effect lung related COPD also include emphysema , gas trapping , chronic bronchitis . Symptoms productive cough , dyspnea , exercise intolerance may dismiss normal age , especially old former smoker . Information sparse effect smoke individual diagnose COPD ( base spirometry ) , data high-resolution computed tomography ( CT ) scan individual limit . COPD strongly associate smoking , smoker develop COPD . Cigarette smoking continue common addiction Kazakhstan despite effort reduce prevalence . The study objectives assess true prevalence COPD base pulmonary function assessment structural change ( emphysema large small airway inflammation thicken ) identify high-resolution computer tomography ( CT-scan ) addition standard spirometric criterion symptom dyspnea , exercise limitation , chronic bronchitis . Such comprehensive approach allow objective comparison ( 1 ) current smoker conventional cigarette - 500 participant , ( 2 ) subject quit smoke within past 1 - 5 year - 200 participant , ( 3 ) subject never smoke cigarette - 200 participant . Using high resolution CT addition spirometry type lung function assessment help determine COPD prevalence among non-smokers , smoker conventional cigarette quit smoking . COPD prevalence define base abnormal respiratory function assess standard spirometric test use COPD assessment test ( CAT ) questionnaire , 6-minute walk test high-resolution compute tomographic ( HRCT ) scan chest patient preserve pulmonary function clinical symptom . The cross-sectional study retrospective sense , allow collect historical data smoking , smoke cessation , address socio-demographic differential smoke . The investigator also address relationship liver disease COPD . This determine base presence hepatitis B C test ( antigens antibody ) , liver enzyme level concentration alpha-1-antitripsine , relate development COPD . Current former smoker concomitant diagnosis asthma exclude cross-sectional study . Instead , historical data whether participant diagnose asthma collect . The cross-sectional study several study group base exposure ( smoke behavior ) status . Combinations pair association follow : smoker vs. never-smokers ; smoker vs. ex-smokers ; never-smokers vs. ex-smokers . Therefore , bear feature retrospective cohort study , specifically ; provide opportunity make comparison group . While calculate required sample size , investigator consider opportunity important one . In addition calculate prevalence ratio COPD exposure status , cross-sectional study allow assessment prevalence condition characteristics different study group . Data collect - Spirometry ( FEV / FVC ) , bronchodilation test - COPD assessment test ( CAT ) questionnaire , - 6-minute walk test - Electrocardiography - High-resolution computed tomographic ( HRCT ) scan chest - Blood pressure - Body mass index ( BMI ) - Smoking status history - Passive smoking status - Occupational exposure - Exposure indoor biofuel pollution - Patient-reported comorbidities - Laboratory testing : blood cholesterol level , HDL ( high-density lipoprotein ) , LDL ( low-density lipoprotein ) , triglyceride , C-reactive protein , fibrinogen , glucose , Hepatitis B C IgM IgG antigens antibody , liver enzymes ( ALT AST ) , alpha-1-antitrypsine . The investigator plan recruit subject use follow mechanism , namely , social medium , network medical referral site ( polyclinics ambulatory center ) , large corporation , i.e . 500 employee . Information current smoking behavior detail historic information smoking behavior use adjustment data analysis phase .</detailed_description>
