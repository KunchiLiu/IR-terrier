	<brief_title>Effect Vascepa Improving Coronary Atherosclerosis People With High Triglycerides Taking Statin Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Residual cardiovascular ( CV ) risk remain dyslipidemic patient despite intensive statin therapy , underscore need additional intervention . Eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) , omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid , incorporate membrane phospholipid atherosclerotic plaque exert beneficial effect pathophysiologic cascade onset plaque formation rupture . EPA also improve atherogenic dyslipidemia characterize reduction triglyceride without raise low-density lipoprotein cholesterol . All data support biologic plausibility EPA anti-atherosclerotic agent . The goal study evaluate whether treatment Vascepa ( 4 gram ) result great change baseline low attenuation plaque placebo subject elevate triglyceride ( 200-499 mg/dl ) .</detailed_description>
