	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II/III compare rilotumumab give together erlotinib hydrochloride erlotinib hydrochloride alone treat patient stage IV squamous cell lung cancer come back previous treatment . This sub-study include screened patient positive meet proto-oncogene ( MET ) /hepatocyte growth factor ( HGF ) biomarker . HGF interact MET cause tumor cell grow quickly . Rilotumumab may decrease activity HGF may able shrink tumor . Erlotinib hydrochloride may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . It yet know whether give rilotumumab erlotinib hydrochloride work well erlotinib hydrochloride alone ( standard treatment ) treat squamous cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate sufficient evidence continue phase III component sub-study compare investigator-assessed progression-free survival ( IA-PFS ) rilotumumab plus erlotinib versus erlotinib patient register S1400E . ( Phase II ) II . To determine statistically clinically-meaningful difference IA-PFS patient randomize receive rilotumumab plus erlotinib versus erlotinib . ( Phase III ) III . To compare overall survival ( OS ) patient randomize rilotumumab plus erlotinib versus erlotinib . ( Phase III ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare response rate ( confirm unconfirmed , complete partial response ) among patient measurable disease randomize receive rilotumumab plus erlotinib versus erlotinib . ( Phase II ) II . To evaluate frequency severity toxicity associate rilotumumab plus erlotinib versus erlotinib . ( Phase II ) III . To compare response rate ( confirm unconfirmed , complete partial ) among patient measureable disease randomize receive rilotumumab plus erlotinib versus erlotinib . ( Phase III ) IV . To evaluate frequency severity toxicity associate rilotumumab plus erlotinib versus erlotinib . ( Phase III ) TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate treatment arm randomization acceptance rate within treatment arm sub-study define percentage patient randomize treatment arm receive protocol treatment . II . To identify additional predictive tumor/blood biomarkers beyond choose biomarker . III . To identify potential resistance biomarkers disease progression . IV . To establish tissue/blood repository patient refractory squamous cell cancer . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive rilotumumab intravenously ( IV ) day 1 erlotinib hydrochloride orally ( PO ) daily day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive erlotinib hydrochloride PO daily day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow death 3 year sub-study registration , whichever occur first .</detailed_description>
