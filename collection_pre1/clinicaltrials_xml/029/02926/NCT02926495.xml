	<brief_summary>Hypertension serious public health issue , affect approximately 30 % adult . Hypertension greatly contribute risk heart disease stroke , among top three lead cause death Americas , Europe , Asia . While treated individual hypertension control medication , diet exercise , estimate 12 % resistant conventional medical intervention . Alternative effective treatment still need hypertensive patient population mitigate risk incidence mortality morbidity . This original Investigational Device Application study intend confirm safety efficacy bilateral subcutaneous median nerve stimulation use eCoin system treat resistant hypertension . The eCoin device delivers electrical stimulation pulse median nerve small coin size device place skin distal anterior forearm . The implant delivers weekly 30 minute treatment base previous study show long lasting cumulative effect . The safety efficacy eCoin therapy previously demonstrate multinational , randomize , double-blind , sham-controlled study New Zealand , Taiwan Canada . This trial multi-center , prospective , double-blind , 1:1 randomize sham-controlled study safety effectiveness eCoin median nerve neuromodulation subject drug-treatment resistant hypertension . The eCoin neuromodulation device implant subcutaneously right left forearm patient uncontrolled hypertension despite treatment 3 antihypertensive agent . After 4 week implant healing period , subject 1:1 randomized either treatment control group . One half subject device activate ( treatment ) half undergo sham activation ( control ) maintain participant blinding treatment allocation . During six month post-randomization , eCoin ON treatment group OFF control group .</brief_summary>
