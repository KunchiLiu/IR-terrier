	<detailed_description>The investigator aim compare individual team performance resident teach personal optimization skill ( positive reinforcement , personalize psycho-physiological relaxation , mental rehearsal ) n't . The investigator go compare group anesthesiology resident go scenario simulate critical event high fidelity simulation session . Scenarios record analyzed 2 reviewer independently . A specific checklist appropriate treatment non technical skill checklist use cote team performance ( OTTAWA TEAM scale ) . Stress participant assess visual analogic scale participant anxiety stress . The two group compare see improvement team performance associate intervention .</detailed_description>
