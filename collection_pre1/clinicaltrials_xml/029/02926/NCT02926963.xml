	<brief_summary>Chronic granulomatous disease ( CGD ) rare genetic disease innate immune due malfunction phagocytic cell unable destroy pathogen infection . The four gene implicate CYBB , CYBA , NCFA NCF2 respectively encode Nox2 , p22phox , p47phox p67phox . Nox2 analog recently discover cell phagocyte . So question arises physiopathological impact absence thesis proteins phagocyte also cell type fibroblast neuron . The principal objective thus study impact protein deficit Nox2 p22phox , pathophysiology neuron inducible pluripotent bone marrow cell ( iPSC ) . For purpose , collection build fibroblast keratinocytes patient different form CGD get iPSC similar embryonic marrow cell differentiable several cell type ( neuron , phagocyte ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Non randomise pilot descriptive multicentric study . Since recently show Nox2p22phox protein express phagocytic cell also non-phagocytic cell fibroblast , epithelial cell , vascular cell , neuron . If pathological consequence deficiency Nox2 p22phox , essential production bactericidal toxic derivative level phagocytic cell , well document , impact absence type non-phagocytic cell know . A good understanding impact absence protein tissue could improve management CGD patient provide specific monitor condition . Similarly formation different cell model genetic form CGD exist present great use study physiopathology disease tool future study . The study require inclusion minor subject CGD usually diagnose early childhood ( &lt; 2 year ) , rare ( frequency 1/200 000 ) life expectancy reduce . To elaborate cell collection , hair skin biopsy necessary . They perform local anesthesia adult , plan general anesthesia minor . Fibroblasts keratinocytes culture obtain conventional control method absence expression p22phox Nox2 check . Measurement kinetics neuronal development apoptosis iPSC perform differentiation system 2 dimension stromal cell MS5 . For , marker neuronal differentiation step measure . Measurement Reactive Oxygen Species ( ROS ) phagocytes p22phox deficient Nox2 differentiation iPSC ( chemiluminescence , flow cytometry ) perform . Measurement effectiveness phagocytosis ( phagocytic function ) phagocytes deficient p22phox Nox2 differentiation iPSC ( flow cytometry ) perform . The absence protein p22phox Nox2 phagocytes p22phox deficient Nox2 differentiation iPSC ( western blot , flow cytometry ) verify . Kinetic transformation fibroblast derive CGD patient deficiency p22phox Nox2 myofibroblasts measure . To answer principal objective study recruitment 10 patient necessary .</detailed_description>
