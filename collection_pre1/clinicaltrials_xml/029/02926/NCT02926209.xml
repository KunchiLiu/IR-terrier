	<brief_summary>This prospective multi-center , multi-national comparative non-blinded clinical investigation . Each subject undergo back-to-back tandem colonoscopy Aer-O-Scope Colonoscope System conventional colonoscope since tandem colonoscopy study , subject serve control . The 1st procedure randomize , half Aer-O-Scope Colonoscope System half conventional colonoscope . The investigator perform procedure subject . All pathology find either remove tattooed . Unmarked pathology find second pas represent miss 1st pas , thus make subject control one . Tattooed pathology remove endoscopically remove additional colonoscopy . This may occur large polyp remove reason Aer-O-Scope , remove conventional colonoscopy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subjects randomize block twenty ( 20 ) either Aer-O-Scope conventional colonoscopy first procedure . Physicians notified procedural order immediately prior first colonoscopy . Up first ten ( 10 ) case physician ( system operation training case ) begin Aer-O-Scope colonoscopy first procedure . The primary endpoint AMR chosen measure appear related performance colonoscopy reduction colorectal cancer incidence . During course last decade , several major visualization study perform become common practice use `` second-pass '' method measure colonoscopy visualization method , iii , iv . In `` second-pass '' method , course first colonoscopy , visualized lesion remove ( tattooed event remove reason. ) . Any unmarked abnormality discover second pas colonoscopy consider missed pathology first pass colonoscopy . All endpoint relate timing measure use stopwatch overall time stamp Aer-O-Scope conventional colonoscope . Time perform therapeutic intervention Aer-O-Scope well description say intervention also record . The instrument use measure procedure calibrate dictated manufacturer . All equipment use course clinical investigation undergo calibration test per manufacturing instruction . The Aer-O-Scope Colonoscope System automate calibration system diagnostic test run daily . Conventional colonoscope maintain per hospital/manufacturer protocol . Recruited subject withdraw result poor bowel prep medical determination lead inability undergo colonoscopy and/or tandem colonoscopy replace . A poor prep define score score 0 1 Boston Bowel Preparation Scale ( BBPS ) . The BBPS score follow : 0 = Unprepared colon segment mucosa see due solid stool clear . 1 . = Portion mucosa colon segment see , area colon segment well see due staining , residual stool and/or opaque liquid . 2 . = Minor amount residual staining , small fragment stool and/or opaque liquid , mucosa colon segment see well . 3 . = Entire mucosa colon segment see well residual staining , small fragment stool opaque liquid . Any subject withdrawn result physician discretion due concomitant medical issue withdraw prior actual colonoscopic procedure . Patients large polyp ( &gt; 20mm ) remove first pas conventional colonoscope withdrawn . Patients receive treatment first pas clip ( option available ) withdrawn . Coagulation therapy perform either Argon Plasma Coagulation ( APC ) another cautery tool contact thermal device per clinical protocol . For purpose clinical investigation , clip use unless alternative . Patients treat clip prior final pas colonoscopy , withdrawn investigation . Physicians may also withdraw patient due medical cause deem appropriate , include patient undergone least one ( 1 ) procedure .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1 . Subject indicate screening , diagnostic ( minor complaint rectal bleed minor abdominal pain ) surveillance colonoscopy 2 . Subject willing undergo tandem colonoscopy AerOScope Colonoscope conventional colonoscope ( include single colon preparation bowel cleanse ) 3 . Subject age 45 75 ( patient age 45 50 must family history first degree relative onset colon cancer age 60 ) . 4 . Subject able understand willing sign inform consent form 1 . Personal history colorectal neoplasia include familial adenomatous polyposis hereditary nonpolyposis , colon cancer ( HNPCC ) . 2 . Diagnosis active ( flare ) inflammatory bowel disease ( active ulcerative colitis Crohn 's colitis ) , bowel obstruction , acute diverticulitis , know severe diverticulosis , fecal incontinence know largebowel disease would require predetermined therapeutic colonoscopy ( nonscreening , nondiagnostic nonsurveillance case ) 3 . Severe gastrointestinal tractrelated symptom , complaint , suggest performance predetermine therapeutic colonoscopy ( nonscreening , nondiagnostic nonsurveillance case ) 4 . History colonic resection 5 . Clinically significant cardiovascular pulmonary disease . 6 . Cancer life threaten disease significant chronic condition put subject risk . 7 . Bloodclotting disorder and/or current anticoagulant therapy ( Subjects take 100mg aspirin prophylactic treatment acceptable study ) 8 . Pregnancy 9 . Previous radiation therapy abdomen 10 .
