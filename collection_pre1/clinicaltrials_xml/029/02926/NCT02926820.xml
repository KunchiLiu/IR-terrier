This study target work memory ( WM ) , ability actively hold information mind order perform complex mental task , give report WM dysfunction patient HD . The investigator examine feasibility conduct 5-week WM training program ( Cogmed ) . Patient adherence treatment tolerance assess . In addition , preliminary evidence efficacy train program target cognitive ability examine . Nine patient pre-manifest early stage HD underwent training . Patients assess intervention one week completion .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Huntington disease ( HD ) associate variety cognitive deficit , prominent difficulty work memory ( WM ) . WM deficits notably compromise early-onset prodromal HD patient . This study aim determine feasibility computer-ized WM training program ( Cogmed QM ) , novel HD population . Nine patient , age 26-62 , early stage HD underwent 25-session ( 5 days/week 5 week ) WM train program ( Cogmed QM ) . Training exercise involve manipulation storage verbal visuospatial information , difficulty adapt function individual performance . Neuropsychological test conducted training , performance criterion WM measure ( Digit Span Spatial Span ) near-transfer WM measure ( Symbol Span Auditory WM ) evaluate . Post-training inter-views patient experience thematically analyze use NVivo software . Seven nine patient demonstrated adherence training complete session within recommend timeframe 5 week . All adherent patient report found training helpful ( n=7 ) , almost felt memory improve ( n=6 ) . Compared baseline score , patient show significant improvement neuropsychological measure verbal WM , include Digit Span ( p = .047 ) Auditory WM ( p = .041 ) . This pilot study provide support feasibility computerize WM train early-stage patient HD . Results suggest HD patient improve WM intensive training , though full-scale intervention project need understand reliability change time .</detailed_description>
