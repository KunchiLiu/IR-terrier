	<brief_title>A Clinical Trial Treatment Aromatic L-amino Acid Decarboxylase ( AADC ) Deficiency Using AAV2-hAADC - An Expansion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methods : AAV2-hAADC viral vector produce GMP facility . Single dose toxicity test AAV2-hAADC rat compete GLP facility reveal acute toxicity . Viral vector inject directly bilateral putamen stereotactic surgery . The safety surgery monitor compute tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . Efficacy treatment monitor positron emission tomography ( PET ) , cerebral spinal fluid ( CSF ) neurotransmitter level , motor mental developmental scales.Expected achievement : Since motor dysfunction cause major morbidity patient AADC deficiency , restore AADC activity putamen relieve motor symptom , demonstrate compassionate treatment . This study chance treatment patient AADC deficiency . The investigator expect high chance complete trial proceed drug approval Phase III pivotal trial . The conduction clinical trial human gene therapy also trigger advance biotechnology Taiwan .</detailed_description>
