	<brief_summary>Recently , emerge interest manipulate gut microbiota ( composed microorganism live digestive system ) influence learning , memory cognition . This influence think primarily occur via gut endocrine immune system , vagus nerve , influence brain function modulate intestinal microorganism . One way manipulate microbiota ingest dietary compound , prebiotics . Prebiotics non-digestible dietary fibre enhance growth `` healthy '' bacteria intestine give adequate amount . Prebiotics relatively stable , stored room temperature easily add food drink . They degrade enzyme acid digestive tract ; therefore reach colon relatively unchanged , metabolise specific bacteria , thus promote beneficial effect . Prebiotics find small proportion vegetable fruit leek , onion , tomato , garlic , etc. , naturally occur quantity generally insufficient promote significant growth beneficial bacteria . Therefore , large quantity purify prebiotics available powder supplement sell package appropriate dose . Pre-clinical study animal show prebiotics modulates brain expression key molecule involve cognition brain health rat . These finding therefore highlight potential influencing cognition manipulation gut microbiota ( case , via ingestion prebiotic ) . Building evidence , aim study investigate manipulate gut microbiota influence reading , learn behaviour group child whose reading score suggest room improvement .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study randomise , double-blind , between-subjects , placebo-controlled design , whereby participant receive 12-week treatment Bimuno match placebo . Children whose Key Stage 1 score indicate within low quintile literacy , whose teacher judge significant learning difficulty , invite screen study . The teacher also need confirm read still cause concern ; , child longer consider inclusion study . Teachers ask add name additional child whose reading show room improvement . These child assess ensure meet inclusion/exclusion criterion . If child pass initial school screening stage , conditional parental consent , he/she assess use read test British Ability Scale ( BAS ) . Only whose read fall bottom 20th centile BAS word reading measure invite take part full study . The study include three session total ( take place school ) : ( 1 ) screening session , ( 2 ) baseline session ( 3 ) post-intervention test session . Children also ask wear actigraphy device 5 consecutive night treatment . In addition , child ask give saliva sample occasion ( home - pre- post-intervention - , well baseline test session visit ) . Parents teacher ask complete standardised questionnaire also treatment end .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Children Children academic year group 3 , 4 5 ( generally age 7 9 year ) , male female , underperform literacy skill accord nationally standardise assessment scholastic achievement age 7 ( Key Stage 1 ) . To eligible , child must confirm score ≤ 20th centile reading , judge teacher significant learning difficulty ; Children willing able give inform assent participation study comply study requirement ; Fluent English speaker , measure validate child . Parents Parents child select study ( screen read test ) , willing able give inform consent comply study requirement ; Fluent English speaker , measure validate adult . Teachers • Primary school teacher child select study , willing able give inform consent comply study requirement . Children Major learn disability medical disorder ( include disease affect human gastrointestinal tract ) ; Participants currently take ( intend take ) medication may affect outcome , include medication affect brain processing , sedation , gut health motility ( example include antidepressant , anxiolytic , cholinergic agonist , among others ) ; Participants know intolerance lactose ; Participants take food supplement , opinion Investigators , may affect result ; Antibiotic , probiotic and/or prebiotic treatment least 2 previous month ; Any significant change diet , discretion Investigators , may affect result ; Participants recently participate another research trial , discretion Investigators , may affect result ; Any firm plan child family move school intervention period ; Any significant finding arise screening/selection process , opinion Investigators , may influence participant 's ability take part study study result . Parents • Lack availability comply study procedure . Teachers • Lack availability comply study procedure .</criteria>
