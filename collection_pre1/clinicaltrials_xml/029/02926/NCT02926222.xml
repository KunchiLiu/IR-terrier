	<brief_title>Regorafenib Relapsed Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary aim study evaluate overall survival ( OS ) intention treat ( ITT ) population . Secondary aim evaluate progression free survival ( PFS ) , safety , objective response rate ( ORR ) , disease control rate ( DCR ) ITT population , evaluation quality life ( QoL ) . Additional exploratory objective include analysis antiangiogenic metabolic biomarkers tissue first second surgery ( perform ) evaluation certain metabolic feature tumor could involve tumor response antiangiogenic drug .</detailed_description>
