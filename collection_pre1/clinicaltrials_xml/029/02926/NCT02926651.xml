	<brief_summary>As tranexamic acid ( TXA ) become prevalent , patient receive dose regardless pre-operative risk transfusion . Therefore aim study determine whether repeat dose oral TXA reduce post-operative reduction hemoglobin , hematocrit , number transfusion , post-operative blood loss follow primary TKA THA surgeries patient low pre-operative hematocrit high risk transfusion . The investigator hypothesize multi-dose TXA regimen significantly minimize post-operative blood loss transfusion requirement compare use single dose regime .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Single Versus Multi-Dose Oral Tranexamic Acid Patients High Risk Blood Transfusion After Total Joint Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Total joint arthroplasty associate risk moderate significant blood loss . Because TXA show significantly reduce need blood product total joint replacement , standard care many institution . Oral intravenous TXA equivalent , oral TXA cheaper allow ease repeat dose . Although low preoperative hemoglobin risk factor transfusion , study compare standard TXA dosing risk stratify dose TXA . The investigator hypothesize multi-dose TXA regimen significantly minimize post-operative blood loss transfusion requirement compare use single dose regimen . At pre-operative clinic appointment day surgery , study staff ass potential subject 's eligibility . Once eligibility establish , potential subject approach regard participation clinical trial . The investigator provide 48 hour date surgery allot question consideration Informed Consent document . Once patient question answer , patient willing study sign Informed Consent . Patients randomize , via standard randomization table provide 1:1 distribution subject two group block randomization , later morning surgery either two treatment group : Conventional Oral TXA Group Multi-Dose Oral TXA Group .</detailed_description>
