	<brief_title>Assessing Current Peripheral Nerve Block Catheter Fixation Dressing Strategies : An Equivalence Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Generally speak , goal affix dress peripheral nerve block ( PNB ) catheter include preservation position integrity catheter , integrity skin , avoidance infection . In order accomplish , nerve block catheter Boston Children 's Hospital ( BCH ) affix patient 's skin dress number way , usually base provider preference . Just care provider routinely employ several combination tape , occlusive dressing skin preparation secure protect intravenous catheter ( think standard-of-care base frequency use ) , member regional service dress PNB catheter various combination catheter anchor , Dermabond , Mastisol , Tegaderms . The exact combination base physician preference and/or habit , though dress scheme generally employ minimum standard catheter anchor ( provide catheter manufacturer ) Tegaderm , frequently addition either Mastisol Dermabond combination . The four possible combination current use : 1 . Catheter anchor Tegaderm ; 2. catheter anchor , Mastisol Tegaderm ; 3. catheter anchor , Dermabond Tegaderm ; 4. catheter anchor , Mastisol , Dermabond Tegaderm As formal record keep dress type and/or component , accurate way quantify frequency dress type employ much less whether certain dress strategy historically effective others maintain integrity catheter surround skin . These variation routine practice suggest agreement benefit add either Mastisol Dermabond ( ) dress scheme , especially give potential liability include skin irritation ( Mastisol , anecdotal BCH ) , expense ( Dermabond , approximately $ 20/use ) time ( couple minute dry time added element ) . Mastisol waterproof , clear liquid adhesive largely replaced tincture benzoin part occlusive dressing ( nerve block catheter , IVs , arterial central line ) report significantly low risk skin irritation ( 1 ) . As , Mastisol essentially become standard care skin fixation dress numerous catheter type . Papers adult pediatric regional anesthesia literature cite use Mastisol routine component catheter fixation dress well ( 2-4 ) . However , little data literature evaluate efficaciousness Mastisol insofar reduce catheter leakage dislodgement hence justify continue use part catheter dressing . One study healthy adult demonstrate differential force require dislodge tap IV catheter without Mastisol ( 64 ± 1 vs. 46 ± 2 Newtons ) however data catheter dislodgement rate time clinical setting ( 5 ) . One case report pediatric literature propose theoretical benefit Mastisol use insofar prevent regional anesthesia catheter dislodgement , provide clinical data ( 6 ) . Dermabond cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive form strong bond across appose wound edge , allow normal heal occur serve barrier bacterial infiltration wound . It market replace suture 5-0 small diameter incisional laceration repair . This adhesive show save time wound repair , provide flexible water-resistant protective coating eliminate need suture removal . Like Mastisol , Dermabond become commonplace addition PNB catheter dressing securement puncture/insertion site closure BCH nationally . And , like Mastisol , little available data regard whether Dermabond use part dress scheme make difference insofar catheter dislodgment prevention infection . A case series three patient report recently 2003 describe inclusion Dermabond technique offer simple , alternative method secure catheter prolong period time yet offer qualitative quantitative outcome data ( 7 ) . Other , invasive , method fasten catheter advocate well , suture , retrograde subcutaneous tunneling ( 8 ) , cutaneous suture ( 9 ) . Providers BCH elsewhere much disagree correct dress nerve block catheter might simply relevant data guide decision-making . The physician BCH institution use method believe best incorporate personal experience well clinician . All agree primary goal , benefit , good dressing system would effective catheter stabilization , prevention catheter occlusion leakage , keep site clean dry , avoidance infection . To-date , however , nerve block catheter dressing study rigorous way might evaluate various technique outcomes . There scant literature available topic generally , despite dress 's presumed importance maintain appropriate position nerve block catheter tip maximal efficacy . The literature , call , largely comprised numerous YouTube video describe dress secure methodology nerve catheter ( 10 ) ; however none report evaluated rigorous prospective retrospective analysis . ( Reference general category YouTube video make essentially source , reflect , standard care indicate relative lack rigorous evaluation catheter secure technique currently available ) . Therefore investigator wish study whether addition Mastisol , Dermabond PNB catheter dressing BCH influence outcome catheter dislodgment function , skin integrity , avoidance infection . As , investigator propose prospective , randomize study equivalence dress type hypothesis 10 % difference rate catheter dislodgement ( primary endpoint ) 4 commonly use dress scheme PNB catheter BCH .</detailed_description>
