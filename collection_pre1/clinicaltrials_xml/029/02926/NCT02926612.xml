	<brief_title>Pathogen Identification Pediatric Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Patients With Suspected Lower Respiratory Tract Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study multicenter cross-sectional observational analysis unused low respiratory tract secretion collect child history HCT undergoing evaluation pulmonary complication . Patients screen enrolled study coordinator site , collect submit biospecimens well patient characteristic clinical outcome . Metagenomic NGS perform biospecimens attempt identify microbial pathogen marker host response infection , include immune activation , inflammation , cell damage . This study correlate result patient characteristic , clinical microbiology test result , clinical outcome order evaluate utility metagenomics NGS improve diagnosis LRTI pediatric HCT population .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients â‰¤21 year age history HCT type point past , plan undergo clinicallyindicated collection lower respiratory specimen , include limited bronchoalveolar lavage ( either via plugged telescope catheter CombiCath , fiberoptic bronchoscopy ) tracheal aspirate . For purpose study , induce spontaneous sputum consider low respiratory tract specimen . Patients may underlie indication clinical test low respiratory secretion , include limited suspected infection , noninfectious inflammation , obstructive restrictive lung disease , pulmonary edema , pleural effusion , alveolar hemorrhage , aspiration , pulmonary vascular disease . Patients undergone HCT plan undergo HCT future , hereafter refer preHCT patient , may also enrol . PreHCT patient must intention undergo stem cell transplantation future include limited patient primary immunodeficiency , patient malignancy undergoing induction consolidation chemotherapy , HCT patient select cell source undergo pretransplant conditioning yet receive cellular infusion . Patients &gt; 21 year age . Patients clinical indication obtain low respiratory secretion test part direct patient care exclude . Patients sufficient respiratory secretion remain collection aliquoting indicated clinical test order treat clinician also exclude . Patients undergo low respiratory test solely evaluate relapsed malignancy exclude .</criteria>
