	<brief_title>A Comparative Study Evaluate Bone Height Gain Following Transcrestal Sinus Floor Elevation Using Specially Designed Drills Versus Conventional Osteotome Technique .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Short implant ( &lt; 10 mm ) one option use overcome low vertical bone height maxilla . However , short implant face many challenge small implant surface ; therefore less bone-to-implant contact osseointegration force distribution reduce surface loading . This lead crestal bone resorption thread exposure decrease long term implant success Another treatment option place implant specific anatomical area , pterygoid region zygoma .Many complication report postoperative sinusitis , temporary paresthesia , epistaxis , facial , periorbital hematoma , orbital penetration prosthetic difficulty due implant palatal emergence . Vertical augmentation bone graft another treatment option . However , many drawback unpredictable graft resorption , low bone implant contact , high possibility wound dehiscence , well compromise implant position lead undesirable prosthetic restoration . To overcome problem previously mention procedure , elevation sinus membrane technique propose , perform either lateral window , via crestal access depend remain bone height ( RBH ) . If RBH around 6-9 mm , crestal approach indicate . If RBH le 5 mm , lateral approach perform . For crestal approach , could perform conventional osteotome technique . However , visually restrictive technique may lead sinus perforation well cause complication headache paroxysmal positional vertigo ( Saker e Ogle , 2005 ; Pe√±arrocha-Diago et al. , 2008 ) . To overcome disadvantage conventional osteotome technique , various kit develop transcrestal sinus floor elevation use specially design drill .</detailed_description>
