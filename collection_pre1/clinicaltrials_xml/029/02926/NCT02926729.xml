	<brief_summary>This research study new investigative imaging instrument call nonlinear microscope ( NLM ) . A nonlinear microscope produce image similar ordinary pathologist 's microscope , without first processing tissue make slide . This study determine NLM use evaluate tissue lumpectomy surgery breast cancer order reduce probability standard pathologic examination specimen end operation find close positive margin , thus possibly require patient additional breast surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose research study improve treatment breast cancer reduce number patient require repeat surgical procedure completely remove breast malignancy . In standard procedure , pathologist evaluate tissue sample microscope surgery . The new investigative imaging instrument advance type microscope enable evaluation surgery . The microscope use directly participant operating room , instead use image tissue immediately excision prior conclusion surgery . If pathologic examination use NLM concludes invasive cancer ductal carcinoma situ ( DCIS ) close margin specimen , surgeon notify may decide additional surgical shaving patient leaf operate room , order improve likelihood achieve clean margin reduce probability patient advise another operation achieve clean margin . For patient experimental arm ( NLM ) control arm ( without NLM ) , standard pathologic evaluation specimen do day lumpectomy complete . That pathologic evaluation decide whether recommend patient additional surgery order achieve clean margin . The primary outcome measure percentage patient group advise additional surgery reason .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient schedule undergo lumpectomy breast cancer BIDMC . Core needle biopsy reveal invasive breast cancer DCIS . Female . Minimum age 21 year . Eligible breast conserving surgery , lumpectomy radiation . Estrogen receptor positive ( ER+ ) core needle biopsy , estrogen receptor negative ( ER ) , evaluable estrogen receptor status positive internal control core biopsy . Progesterone receptor positive ( PR+ ) core needle biopsy biopsy indicate invasive cancer , progesterone receptor negative ( PR ) biopsy indicate invasive cancer , evaluable progesterone receptor status positive internal control core biopsy . Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) status review know positive know negative core biopsy , biopsy indicate invasive cancer . Oncotype DX DNA test perform core biopsy indicate . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Contraindicated radiation therapy . Pregnancy . ( Pregnant woman exclude study radiation therapy contraindicate pregnancy . ) Previous surgery DCIS invasive cancer . Any systemic neoadjuvant ( preoperative ) therapy core biopsy lumpectomy . Involvement another therapeutic trial breast cancer Dana Farber elsewhere . Risk poor cosmetic outcome initial lumpectomy possible additional excision . Recommendation mastectomy base radiology . Patients large area DCIS indicate radiology , would require excise large tissue volume . No equivocal ER , PR HER2 test perform prior surgery biopsy indicate invasive cancer . No equivocal ER testing perform prior surgery biopsy indicate ductal carcinoma situ .</criteria>
