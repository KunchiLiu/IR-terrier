	<brief_summary>A. Pancreatic cancer background In 2012 , 1,172 new pancreatic cancer patient diagnose Switzerland . Only 20 % patient newly diagnose pancreatic cancer candidate surgical resection , potential treatment cure . Over 30 % patient initially present locally advanced disease . Patients locally advanced disease evidence metastatic spread liver , lung , peritoneum present local involvement vital structure prohibits reasonable tumor resection . Currently , patient evaluate palliative chemotherapy +/- radiation therapy . However , even best conventional medical therapy , median survival patient locally advanced disease mostly 1 year . Over last year , loco-regional therapy gain increased attention include radiofrequency- , cryo- , microwave ablation well electrochemotherapy . However , entity criticize complication rate lead morbidity mortality , limited area application give complex anatomical structure around pancreas , ill-defined improvement overall survival . B. Irreversible electroporation ( IRE ) : Irreversible electroporation emerge ablative modality gain enormous interest last five year . For locally advanced pancreatic cancer , introduce 2009 . IRE mainly non-thermal primarily work apoptosis . Its well study safety profile allow ablation also within context locally advanced pancreatic cancer give mainly spar vessel destruction . Increasing evidence show IRE locally advance , unresectable pancreatic cancer effective compare historic control significant prolongation local progression free survival , distant progression free survival overall survival . The improvement overall survival double amount see best new chemotherapy chemoradiation regimen use present time . Those result even impressive give discourage improvement among palliative systemic option . The NanoKnife IRE device ( Angiodynamics , Queensbury , NY ) commonly use perform IRE procedures pancreatic cancer patient commercially available since 2009 get Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) 510K clearance soft tissue ablation October 2011 United States . C. Quality life nutritional status/long term outcome Given overall poor long-term outcome patient pancreatic cancer , health-related quality life ( HRQoL ) measure utmost importance treatment recommendation discuss patient . This especially true patient advance staged disease definitive surgical resection curative intent possible . However , HRQoL report patient locally advanced pancreatic cancer undergo IRE limit . To best investigator ' knowledge , specific investigation exist assessed HRQoL measure patient undergo IRE locally advance pancreatic cancer , specific assessment exist focus nutritional status patient group . In addition , impact local distant recurrence well cancer-specific overall survival still ill-defined information need .</brief_summary>
