In case discordance preoperative corebiopsy surgical sample , receptor assessment perform surgical sample consider inclusion criterion evaluation . Availability formalinfixed , paraffinembedded block contain tumor tissue least 7 unstained tumor slide . Patients must complete treatment curative intent include : surgery , adjuvant chemotherapy ( clinically indicate per local policy ) radiotherapy . Adequately excised : patient must undergo either breastconserving surgery mastectomy/nipple skinsparing mastectomy . The margin resect specimen free invasive tumor ductal carcinoma situ ( ink tumor ) . In case breastconserving surgery patient margin positive lobular carcinoma situ ( LCIS ) eligible without additional resection . For patient undergo mastectomy , patient microscopic positive deep margin eligible , provide receive radiotherapy chest wall .
