	<detailed_description>Globally , mortality child five year ( U5MR ) stand 45.6/1000 live birth estimate 6.3 million child five ( U5 ) die year . Despite seemingly impressive global decline U5MR , Sub-Saharan Africa region register increase under-five mortality several country . Most death cause pneumonia ( 15 % ) , diarrhea ( 9 % ) , malaria ( 7 % ) ; diseases symptom overlap , make differential diagnosis difficult . In response , many country sub-Saharan Africa scale integrate community case management ( iCCM ) target malaria , pneumonia diarrhea child U5 . The program typically train community health worker ( CHWs ) ass , classify treat uncomplicated case pneumonia , diarrhea malaria refer child danger sign malnutrition . While mortality impact iCCM difficult demonstrate , clear evidence increase treatment rate among sick child . In Ethiopia , U5MR stand 68/1000 live birth estimate 205,000 child age five die year . iCCM implementation start February 2011 part Ethiopia 's Health Extension Program ( HEP ) , 38,000 female CHWs - locally refer Health Extension Workers ( HEWs ) - train deployed community throughout country provide preventive curative health service . There typically two HEWs assign sub-district population approximately 5,000 . The HEWs supervise health center oversee 5 health post ( 2 HEWs ) . As 2014 , 29,900 HEWs train iCCM use WHO guideline . As per WHO ICCM guideline , child treat illness unclassified fever without danger sign ( treatment withheld ) , counsel follow-up visit three day assess treatment compliance illness resolution . This either do return visit health post home visit CHW systematic follow-up visit . However , febrile illness common childhood , often due virus self-resolving illness . In large proportion case fever resolve rapidly , generally within 48 hour , almost always within 96 hour . It suggest number study safe withhold medical treatment child unclassified fever . In Ethiopia , HEWs follow integrate management neonatal childhood illness ( IMNCI ) manual stipulate caregiver child see HEWs return child fails respond treatment , way conditional follow-up health post , instead WHO recommend iCCM guideline . There limited evidence two recommendation safer child unclear whether caregiver HEWs would comply good systematic follow-up advice compare conditional follow-up advice , whether systematic follow-up visit even necessary . The purpose research therefore assess non-inferiority HEW-advised systematic follow-up day 3 compare conditional follow-up non-severe febrile illness child age 2 59 month , cause fever identify danger sign absent . Methodology Study site : The research study ( TRAction ) conduct three Woredas ( district ) ; Halaba special Woreda Boloso Sore Damot Gale ( Wolayita zone ) Southern Nations , Nationalities People 's Regional State ( SNNPR ) Southwest Ethiopia . The three Woredas select base ) strength iCCM program ( i.e . consistency HEW supervision supply ) , b ) HEW use rate among caregiver , c ) concurrent community mobilization activity grant . The SNNPR estimate total population 18.4 million , make third populous region Ethiopia . The estimated population density 141 people/km2 great variation across region . The health indicator Region among low country accord Ethiopia Demographic Health survey ( EDHS ) 2011 , neonatal , infant U5MR 38 , 78 116 per 1,000 live birth , respectively . The iCCM program functioning district SNNPR , It therefore ideal environment implement research , iCCM service stable program implement Regional Health Bureau provide technical advice project . There 18 Health Centers 102 Health Posts 204 HEWs three select Woredas . According late Malaria Indicator Surveys , awareness risk associate febrile illness child benefit early care seek low , 46.3 % child U5 fever take early treatment . However , care seek health post level show upward trend , presumably result increase awareness availability proximity child health service . Study design : The study conduct randomize , two-arm trial either conditional ( control ) systematic ( intervention ) follow-up advice non-severe febrile child assessment HEWs , classify malaria , pneumonia , diarrhea , symptom require referral . In brief , caregiver child meet inclusion criterion counsel follow one two pathway ( base randomization health facility level ) . The control arm consist conditional follow-up visit , i.e . caregiver counsel return child HEW re-assessment case child deteriorate fever persists 2 day . In contrast , caregiver intervention arm advise systematic follow-up visit , i.e . caregiver child counsel return three day , regardless symptom resolution . All enrolled child Day 7 study visit home independent evaluator assess clinical outcome . Management illness subsequent visit ( return HEW day , return HEW `` intervention '' Day 3 visit , Day 7 assessment ) manage follow establish iCCM guideline . The detail study procedure describe research work plan . Sample Size : The primary outcome sample size base proportion child persistent fever , persistent illness , decline ( hospital , danger sign develop , death ) Day 7 . We assume baseline rate fever/illness persistence low ( ~5 % , base rate ~3 % 10 % previous study ) aim demonstrate significant increase risk . The table show sample size ( total eligible patient ) need non-inferiority margin 0.03 - 0.05 , assume power 80 % alpha 0.05 . A design effect 3 use account cluster CHW health facility level . The shaded row indicate plausible well logistically feasible sample size estimation . Enrollment occur one-year period account seasonality various cause febrile illness . A minimum 4284 child 2-59 month fever malaria , pneumonia diarrhea require study . Based assumption 30 % child fever would eligible study ( malaria , diarrhea , pneumonia referral sign ) , total 16,333 child 2-59 month need screen HEWs . With 12 month data collection , mean average 1,361 child need screen month . Each health post see average 16 child 2-59 month month ; hence 85 health post ( 2 HEWs ) need include study . The unit randomization ( cluster ) health center oversee 5 health post ( 10 HEWs ) . Therefore , total 18 health center ( cluster ) need include study , half randomly allocate intervention arm half control , use restrict randomization minimize difference intervention control cluster . Restricted randomization base key indicator average cluster distance near zonal referral hospital number unclassified fever child 5 see HEWs . Data collection management : The study conduct randomize , two-arm trial either conditional ( control ) systematic ( intervention ) follow-up assessment visit non-severe febrile child assessment HEWs , classify malaria , pneumonia , diarrhea , symptom require referral . Caregivers child meet inclusion criterion counsel follow one two pathway ( base randomization health facility level ) . The intervention arm consist systematic follow-up visit Day 3 —caregivers counsel return child systematically Day 3 HEW follow-up assessment . In contrast , control arm ( current practice ) consist conditional follow-up visit—caregivers counsel return point HEW symptom persist worsen . All enrolled child Day 7 study visit home independent evaluator assess clinical outcome . Children fail treatment day 7 re-assessed day 14 , still fail treatment day 14 follow re-assessment Day 28 . In addition , child enrol followed-up via phone call vital status Day 28 . Management illness subsequent visit ( return HEW day `` control '' visit , return HEW `` intervention '' Day 3 visit , Day 7 assessment ) manage follow establish iCCM guideline child still febrile refer health facility .</detailed_description>
