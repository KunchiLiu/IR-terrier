	<brief_summary>The shoulder mobile joint body still responsibility ensure strong stability upper limbs daily activity . The shoulder joint therefore require significant level neuromuscular control time . The shoulder heavily rely 4 key stabilize muscle , know rotator cuff complex ( RC ) . A tendinopathy RC may cause pain , significant muscle weakness , decrease motor control shoulder functional activity well work task . Individuals RC tendinopathy often neuromuscular proprioceptive deficit . The objective study evaluate effectiveness brand new strength motor control exercise program upper extremity compare effectiveness program usual physiotherapy care ( manual therapy , motion exercise , strengthen , manual technique ) reduce shoulder pain improve overall function . A total 44 participant suffer RC tendinopathy recruit ; 22 assign exercise group ( EXP ) 22 participant receive usual physiotherapy care ( CTL ) . Participants EXP group partake new exercise program 3 time / week 6 week whereas participant CTL group receive usual physiotherapy treatment twice / week home exercise 6 week . The result study provide clinician cost-effective innovative treatment approach treat shoulder pain . This study provide active rehabilitation guideline reduce shoulder pain incidence recurrence .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The importance shoulder everyday movement activity often fully appreciate , limited injury pain . The shoulder complex allow u interact surroundings act functional link stable trunk free move upper limb . This easy task highly mobile joint shoulder . A shoulder injury functionally devastate individual , potentially place unnecessary financial stress health care system . Shoulder pain currently among common reason visit general practitioner physiotherapist today . Shoulder pain third prevalence , back neck pain , nearly two-thirds adult suffer shoulder pain point life . Despite important focus rehabilitative care , yet confidently establish efficient potentially cost effective method treat shoulder pathology pain . Among shoulder disorder , rotator cuff ( RC ) muscle lead source shoulder pain . Due vast mobility shoulder complex , rely greatly stability control provide supportive tissue , notably rotator cuff muscle ; often render highly susceptible injury . It note individual affect rotator cuff tendinopathies ( RCt ) often exhibit motor control shoulder proprioception deficit . As noted Cools colleague , rehabilitative training program focus motor control greatly need rehabilitation well prevent re-injury . Accordingly , rehabilitation intervention focus motor ( ) learning , target well muscle coordination reduce motor control impairment , optimize movement control , improve muscle strength . Motor control rehabilitation : To address motor control deficits among individual affect RCt , develop novel , structure , supervise group exercise-based program focusing neuromuscular reeducation . It well document scientific literature motor control proprioception exercise crucial healing among population . However , effectiveness group delivery method remain unknown . It presently unclear group exercise program compare one-on-one physiotherapy care shoulder dysfunction . The developed group program allow patient individually progress exercise base symptom , guide correct supervise physiotherapist . This model allow several patient access physiotherapy service simultaneously , remain cost resource effective clinic . To appreciate goal propose exercise program , important understand physiological biomechanical factor directly relate shoulder stability . Underlying mechanisms shoulder stability : For joint stability , glenohumeral ( GH ) joint heavily depend muscle strength , adequate synergistic activity neuromuscular structure , well strong joint position sense ( subcategory proprioception ) . Our ability detect limbs space help u interact surroundings contribute neuromuscular stability joint . A RCt often associate subacromial impingement syndrome , structure acromion become pinched arm elevation . Such compression arm movement include abnormal shoulder kinematics , well RC scapular muscle performance deficit . This inadequate scapulothoracic muscle control believe contribute reduction amplitude posterior tilt lateral rotation scapula , cause acromion remain low anterolateral position result dynamic narrowing subacromial space . Also , abnormal muscle control associate superior migration humeral head respect glenoid fossa , lead dynamic narrowing subacromial space . These deficit contribute impingement subacromial structure often lead symptom associate RCt . What make investigate approach unique address RC disorder resource-effective exercise rehabilitation model investigator propose ; motor control strengthen approach well support scientific literature package conveniently resource-friendly protocol . This approach maximize patient autonomy match suitable level physiotherapist supervision . The investigator believe Upper Extremity Neuromuscular Training Program ( UpEx-NTP ) provide realistic financially beneficial solution costly health care problem . Research Question : How 6-week UpEx-NTP improve shoulder function , pain , joint position sense ( JPS ) individual affect rotator cuff ( RC ) tendinopathy compare usual physiotherapy care ? The primary objective randomize control trial ( RTC ) compare , term symptoms functional limitation , group receive supervise rehabilitation program ( UpEx-NTP ) center strength motor control train group receive usual one-on-one physiotherapy clinical care individual affect RC tendinopathy shoulder . A secondary objective explore effect intervention joint position sense ( JPS ) . It hypothesize UpEx-NTP ( Exp ) usual physiotherapy care ( Ctl ) group equally demonstrate statistically ( p-value &lt; 0.05 ) clinically ( noted change MCID : DASH questionnaire = 11 point , WORC index = 12 point Numeric Rating Scale pain = 2 point ) significant change shoulder function pain 6-week period individual RC tendinopathy maintain time , notably 3 6 month intervention . We hypothesize Exp ( UpEx-NTP ) group demonstrate statistically significant improvement ( p-value &lt; 0.05 ) JPS Shoulder Proprioceptive Reaching Test ( SPRET ) compare Clt group , due concentrate motor control proprioceptive exercise UpEx-NTP . The Minimal Detectable Change ( MDC ) yet establish SPRET evaluation tool .</detailed_description>
