	<brief_summary>This study look risk benefit active surveillance ( AS ) compare guideline concordant care ( GCC ) set pragmatic prospective randomize trial low risk DCIS . Our overarch hypothesis management low-risk Ductal Carcinoma Situ ( DCIS ) use AS approach yield inferior cancer quality life outcome compare GCC .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Overdiagnosis overtreatment result mammographic screening estimate high 1 4 patient diagnose breast cancer although absence standard definition measure overdiagnosis lead much uncertainty around estimate . The national health care expenditure result false positive mammogram breast cancer overdiagnosis estimate approach $ 4 billion annually . There general consensus much burden derive treatment DCIS ; estimate 40,000 woman per year whose DCIS may never progress even without treatment , medical intervention harm . In woman undergo surgical management DCIS , risk develop persistent pain surgical site , estimate range 25-68 % . Importantly , persistent pain lumpectomy may prevalent total mastectomy . Persistent postsurgical pain rat patient trouble symptom , lead disability psychological distress , often resistant management . Although prospective population-based data demonstrate significant patient surgical focus pain remarkably high level chronic pain 4 9 month breast surgery , much data collect woman invasive cancer , little data directly relevant patient DCIS . The overarch hypothesis study management low-risk DCIS use active surveillance ( AS ) approach yield inferior cancer quality life outcome compare guideline concordant care ( GCC ) .</detailed_description>
