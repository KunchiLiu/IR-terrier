	<brief_summary>Long-term anticoagulation widely use secondary thromboprophylaxis antiphospholipid syndrome ( APS ) due high risk recurrent event . Currently anticoagulation vitamin K antagonist ( VKAs ) standard care unpredictable pharmacodynamic property requiere monitor dose adjustment . Rivaroxaban , orally active direct factor Xa inhibitor , show effective safe compare warfarin treatment venous thromboembolism non valvular atrial fibrillation major RCTs . No study publish APS.The aim study investigate efficacy safety rivaroxaban prevent recurrent thrombosis patient APS compare acenocumarol</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This phase 3 randomize , multicenter , non-inferiority open-label RCT . 190 eligible APS patient arterial venous thrombotic history receive acenocumarol stratify accord presence SLE venous/arterial thrombotic history randomize ( 1:1 ) either continue vitamin K antagonist ( standard care , normalize ratio ( INR ) 2-3 2.5 3.5 recurrent thrombotic episode ) switch rivaroxaban ( 20 mg/day ) . The primary efficacy outcome development thrombotic event study period . Secondary efficacy outcome include time thrombosis , type thrombosis ( arterial venous ) , overall cause death , evaluation prognostic biomarker panel recurrent thrombosis . The primary safety outcome major bleeding . Secondary safety outcome include adverse event minor bleeding .</detailed_description>
