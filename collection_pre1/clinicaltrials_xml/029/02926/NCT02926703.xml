	<brief_title>Lactate Compared Creatine Kinase Diagnostic Marker Generalized Epileptic Seizure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The patient prospective study select sample patient admitted emergency room University Hospital RWTH Aachen unclear impairment consciousness . Only patient later diagnose experienced GTCS syncope whose serum lactate concentration measure within 2 hour event enrol study . The investigator compare specificity sensitivity serum lactate concentration admission CK concentration admission CK follow-up take 10 48 hour event . The value admission compare patient blood sample collect within 60 minute event , blood sample collect within 61-120 minute event . The comparison initial lactate concentration admission CK level 10 - 48 hour later could perform part patient collective patient already discharge time-point could therefore include . The initial blood sample take patient arrival emergency room . The follow perform inpatient stay . Serum lactate CK concentration patient group statistically compare Mann-Whitney-U test . We define cut-off value sensitivity specificity Receiver Operating Characteristic ( ROC ) analysis .</detailed_description>
