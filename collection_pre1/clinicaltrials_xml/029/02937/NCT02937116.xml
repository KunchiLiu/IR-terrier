	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine safety , tolerability efficacy IBI308 monotherapy combination chemotherapy patient certain type advance solid tumor . Another purpose determine pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamics immunogenicity IBI308</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>First Human Study IBI308 Chinese Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study consist phase 1a study ( dose escalation stage ) phase 1b study ( expansion stage ) . Phase 1a study adopt classical 3+3 dose escalation design , explore safety tolerance 4 dose cohort ( 1mg/kg , 3mg/kg , 200mg 10mg/kg ) determine recommend dose phase 1b study . Phase 1b expand 4 participant population evaluate safety clinical activity IBI308 monotherapy combination chemotherapy : Cohort A ( monotherapy participant advance melanoma ) , Cohort B ( monotherapy participant advance malignancy digestive system failure least 1 line standard therapy ) , Cohort C ( monotherapy participant advance non small cell lung cancer failure intolerance 1st line therapy ) Cohort D ( combination cisplatin pemetrexed treatment naive participant inoperable locally advanced advance non-squamous non small cell lung cancer ) . Phase 1a 1b consist Screening Period ( 28 day enrollment ) , Treatment Period Follow Period ( every 3 month death end study ) . In phase 1a , dose limit toxicity record 28 day 1st dose IBI308 . Efficacy primarily evaluate RECIST v1.1 . Participants ' safety monitor throughout study . Further exploration pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics immunogenicity information assess throughout trial .</detailed_description>
