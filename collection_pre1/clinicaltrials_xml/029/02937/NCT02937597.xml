	<brief_summary>Objective : To determine effectiveness proficiency base inter-professional communication training online environment medical student 's use ISBAR ( Identify , Situation , Background , Assessment , Recommendation ) communication escalation protocol deteriorate patient Setting : The study conduct University College Cork , Ireland . Participants : Fifth year medical student , schedule undertake ISBAR training part National Early Warning Score ( NEWS ) programme . Intervention : Participants prospectively randomize one three group train undertaking performance assessment ISBAR communication relevant deteriorate patient low fidelity simulation environment : HSE group ( national e-learning programme ) ; S group ( national e- learning plus access online scenario facilitator request ) PBP group ( national e-learning plus access online scenario train course in-built proficiency-based progression , facilitator request ) . Main outcome measure : A proficiency benchmark performance ISBAR communication context acutely deteriorate patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>E-learning Proficiency Based Progression Training Programme Clinical Communication ISBAR Performance ( eISBAR )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The first successful simulation validation study use proficiency-based progression methodology . Since approach successfully deploy produce superior technical skill yet validate non-technical ( communication ) skills . It also yet validate medium virtual learning . The ISBAR ( Identify , Situation , Background , Assessment Recommendation ) select standardised tool clinical communication relation acutely deteriorate patient many healthcare organisation worldwide , include Ireland . The aim study explore whether proficiency-based progression ( PBP ) could apply e-learning training course ISBAR performance produce superior skill set . The study compare performance outcomes student receive national e-learning programme receive combination either standard e-learning course scenario proficiency-based progression ( PBP ) e-learning course scenario . Participants prospectively randomize one three training group . Following pre-test observation low-fidelity simulation , undergo respective training course undertake post-test performance assessment ISBAR communication relevant deteriorate patient low fidelity simulation environment : 1 . Online learning ( HSE ) -the national e-learning programme 2 . Scenarios ( S ) -national online learn plus online scenario course train 3 . Proficiency base progression ( PBP ) -national online learn plus proficiency-based progression online scenario course training . Main outcome measure : A proficiency benchmark performance ISBAR communication context acutely deteriorate patient . All participant require supply baseline demographic information undertake training . Performance metric previously identify , operationally define agree upon modify Delphi panel meeting consist medical expert series paper-based simulation case standardise high fidelity simulation case use assessment case . This case use study low fidelity environment . The proficiency benchmark case set base performance experience medical personnel case series step , error critical error . Outcome assessment score review auditory recording ISBAR performance participant standardise case low fidelity simulate environment .</detailed_description>
