	<brief_title>A Phase II , Study Determine Preliminary Efficacy Novel Combinations Treatment Patients With Platinum Refractory Extensive-Stage Small-Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study modular design , allow evaluation preliminary efficacy , safety , tolerability , immunogenicity novel combination immunotherapy and/or deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) damage repair inhibitor patient platinum refractory resistant extensive-stage-disease SCLC . Patient progressive disease ( PD ) first-line platinum-based chemotherapy ( platinum refractory ) PD within 90 day complete first-line platinum-based chemotherapy ( platinum resistant ) enrol study . The primary objective study assess preliminary efficacy treatment arm base objective response rate ( ORR ) . This study consist number arm ( sub-studies ) , evaluate efficacy , safety , tolerability specific agent combination . This study open 2 arm ( Arms A B ) , additional arm may open , provide compel rationale combination safe tolerable dos schedule determine ongoing Phase I study . There 2 pre-defined arm : A. Durvalumab + tremelimumab follow durvalumab monotherapy B. AZD1775 + carboplatin ( CBDP )</detailed_description>
