	<detailed_description>Hemiplegia shoulder complex upper limb common secondary impairment result cerebrovascular event . Although stroke survivor regain independent ambulation , many fail regain functional use impair upper limb . Actually pathogenesis post-stroke shoulder pain seem multifactorial ; differential diagnosis often difficult . Changes shoulder complex make glenohumeral joint vulnerable subluxation , may cause pain . Traction capsule soft tissue relate subluxation shoulder may take place early stage ; limit range motion due spasticity may develop late stage stroke . These biomechanical problem may possible reason pain . Rotator cuff tear rotator cuff deltoid tendinopathies also possible symptom relate hemiplegic shoulder observe magnetic resonance imaging finding . These problem shoulder disturb kinetic chain system connect segment work sequentially proximal distal achieve target movement . When biomechanical impairment happen shoulder segment body , loss energy produce body transfer upper extremity occur . This loss adversely affect quality movement . Regaining functional use upper limb stroke challenge task patient , significant impact individual 's physical , psychological , emotional well-being . Lack functional ability upper extremity stroke restricts use cause asymmetric posture contracture daily life , thus exacerbate functional limitation upper limb . Also , low upper limb motor function relate risk soft tissue injury rehabilitation . A patient experience stroke may feel pain due subluxation . However , different muscle group may vulnerable overstretch , increased contraction , premature fatigue . This decrease coordination muscular activity inhibit functional use upper extremity . The posterior fiber deltoid , supraspinatus , infraspinatus important muscle prevent subluxation glenohumeral joint .</detailed_description>
