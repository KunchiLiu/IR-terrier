	<brief_summary>Intervention : All patient presentation would assess underlying cause manage removal precipitant ( careful review medication , diuretic , nephrotoxic drug , vasodilator non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ) . The second step would consider plasma volume expansion patient hypovolemia ( choice fluid could either crystalloid albumin even blood indicate ) along identification early treatment bacterial infection . Along patient differential diagnosis HRS-AKI would give terlipressin ( noradrenaline/octreotide midodrine case contraindication terlipressin ) . Patients clinical diagnosis ATN would randomize on-demand versus protocol-guided dialysis group . Further , patient urine output less 0.5ml/kg/hour 4-6 hour despite adequate fluid resuscitation vasoconstrictor would also subject randomization . 1 . In on-demand group patient would get dialysis patient fulfills absolute criterion require dialysis metabolic acidosis ph &lt; 7.2 , hyperkalemia , refractory fluid overload ( non-responsive diuretic ) oliguria urine output less 0.5ml/kg 24-48 hour time randomization 2 . In protocol guide group patient patient would consider dialysis within 6 hour randomization After randomization patient would receive dialysis three session per week least 4 h blood flow &gt; 200 mL/min dialysate flow &gt; 500 mL/min intermittent group 20-25 mL/kg/h effluent , filtration and/or diffusion continuous form recovery renal function</brief_summary>
