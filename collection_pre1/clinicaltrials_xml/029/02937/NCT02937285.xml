	<brief_summary>The relative effectiveness current treatment different mechanism action yield consider multiple sclerosis ( MS ) therapeutic approach must use multiple molecule , combine sequential . In sense , one assume combination two molecule different complementary mechanism action , delay progression disease . Mitoxantrone powerful action , immediate total , whereas interferon selective action , immunomodulatory delay .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>National Multicenter , Controlled , Single-blind Study With Two Parallel Groups Evaluating Safety Efficacy Sequential Treatment With Mitoxantrone Interferon Versus Interferon Alone Patients With Strong Risk Progression Initial Phase Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study base hypothesis synergistic effect increase dose interferon also use mitoxantrone , allow reduce conversion rate MS. Because mitoxantrone decrease rate relapse 2 time interferon beta , ( least ) 2 time high benefit disease activity expect interferon mitoxantrone combination interferon alone .</detailed_description>
