	<brief_title>Efficacy Partial Covered Double Bare Metal Stent Compared Uncovered Double Bare Metal Stent Malignant Biliary Obstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Malignant obstructive jaundice common complication advance stage cholangiocarcinoma , GB cancer , pancreatic cancer . In biliary stricture malignancy , biliary drainage placement self-expanding metal stent ( SEMS ) palliation therapy choice patient . When compare plastic stent , SEMS present significantly decrease risk recurrent biliary obstruction . SEMS also cost-effective plastic stent patient life expectancy longer 4 month . However , despite numerous benefit , SEMS become occluded 50 % patient first 6-8 month . In order minimize occurrence issue , cover stent develop . Previous study indicate covered stent less likely become occlude comparison bare stent . While probability occlusion cause tumor in-growth less covered stent , likely spontaneously migrate position distal original deployment site . However , new cover stent improved design , partially cover double bare metallic stent use study , include feature mitigate migration issue . The purpose study confirm whether difference patency rate regular cover stent bare stent , already well establish exist study , also reproducible double covered stent compare double bare stent .</detailed_description>
