	<brief_title>To Evaluate Efficacy Experimental Dissolvable Strip Rapidly Relieving Dentinal Hypersensitivity ( DH )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-centre , randomized-controlled , examiner-blind , two treatment group ( test treatment ) , parallel design , stratify ( maximum baseline Schiff sensitivity score two selected test teeth ) study , healthy participant least two sensitive teeth meet criterion screen baseline pre-treatment visit . DH assess baseline ( pre-treatment ) , 10mins , 2 &amp; 4 hour post-treatment .</detailed_description>
