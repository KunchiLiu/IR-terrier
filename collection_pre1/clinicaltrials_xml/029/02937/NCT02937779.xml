	<brief_summary>The World Health Organization recommend high endemic country HBV infection base mother child transmission prevention strategy vaccination child administration immunoglobulin ( HBIG ) infant bear infected mother first 24 hour birth . Lack access antenatal screen HBIG significantly result failure strategy many country . Moreover , despite sero-vaccination , 10 15 % infant mother positive HBsAg HBeAg still infect , high level HBV replication occur third quarter pregnancy act major risk factor . The objective study ass effectiveness operational strategy prevent HBV mother-to-child transmission ( MTCT ) Cambodia base use rapid test HBs Ag HBe Ag screen HBV infection treatment TDF patient positive HBeAg test `` test treat '' strategy see Antenatal Care ( ANC ) 24 week amenorrhea . In case , vaccination newborn carry accord national protocol Cambodia i.e . 4 injection 24 hour , 6 , 10 14 week age . A phase IV multicenter observational interventional non randomize prospective study conduct 4 maternity Cambodia . The primary outcome proportion active HBV infection new-born 6 month life estimate HBs Ag positivity . The study aim document acceptability operational implementation study use rapid test usable health center drug available country thanks HIV national program .

	<detailed_description>Principal objective : Assess effectiveness strategy prevent HBV mother-to-child transmission ( MTCT ) Cambodia base use rapid test HBs Ag HBe Ag screen HBV infection treatment TDF patient positive HBeAg test `` test treat '' strategy see Antenatal Care ( ANC ) 24 week amenorrhea . Secondary objective Assess feasibility acceptability patient health care provider rapid test screen strategy Assess acceptability test treat strategy patient see 24 week amenorrhea Describe HBV viral load ( VL ) decrease cause TDF Estimate rate HBV transmission newborn accord time spend TDF well initial viral load level delivery viral load level Estimate rate HBV transmission newborn HBe Ag negative woman Describe correlation HBV viral load level HBe Ag status Describe subgroups mother new-borns strategy seem effective Assess TDF safety mother Analyse cost-effectiveness strategy compare international guideline ( WHO , APASL ) Each woman inform objective total duration study well benefit risk participate . An information sheet Khmer give woman . The study compose two phase information 's consent . The first one do HBs Ag screen use rapid test ; screen propose pregnant woman attend ANC one affiliate centre . The second phase do inclusion visit concern HBs Ag positive woman . The study concern HBs Ag positive woman 1 ) follow HBsAg positive woman inclusion 6 month postpartum 2 ) For HBeAg positive woman , initiation treatment fumarate de tenofovir disoproxil ( VireadÂ® ) , daily administration one 300mg pill . Women treat 24 week amenorrhea 6 week post-partum . For woman first ANC 24 week amenorrhea , treatment begin day inclusion . Treatment give 4 week adherence estimate . In case , vaccination newborn carry accord national protocol Cambodia i.e . 4 injection 24 hour , 6 , 10 14 week age . A total 933 positive HBs Ag pregnant woman enrol include 280 HBe Ag positive woman 653 HBe negative woman .</detailed_description>
