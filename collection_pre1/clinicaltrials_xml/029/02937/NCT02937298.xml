	<brief_summary>Weight gain occur imbalance energy balance favour energy intake . Whilst 50 % person 's energy requirement go towards maintenance physiological function , around 40 % used physical activity . In addition , around 10-15 % energy spent term Diet Induced Thermogenesis ( DIT ) . Diet Induced Thermogenesis increase energy expenditure follow meal , represent energy utilised digestion metabolism food . Some nutrient protein require energy digest therefore produce great DIT others . In addition , food component able independently stimulate calorie burn . For example caffeine , chilli , ginger green tea show induce calorie burn DIT . Therefore inclusion food diet could increase energy expenditure thereby help weight control . The objective study determine DIT effect plant food native Scotland ( blackberry , blueberry , red raspberry , wild garlic sea buckthorn ) . These food show contain compound stimulate DIT . If find effective , food could use develop dietary strategy weight control Scotland .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Obesity prevalence increase around world United Kingdom exception . Latest statistic show approximately 25 % UK population obese predict rise 70 % 2020 present trend continue . Obesity particularly widespread Scotland approximately 62 % population BMI 25kg/m2 . Curtailing obesity rate public health priority excess weight also great predictor co-morbidities cardiovascular disease , cancer diabetes , hence collectively exert significant toll health economic burden country . Weight gain occur primarily due imbalance energy balance status energy intake outweighs expenditure . Energy expenditure ( EE ) adult consist three component : basal metabolism ( 50-70 % EE ) , physical activity ( 30-40 % EE ) diet induced thermogenesis ( DIT ) . The latter described thermic effect food increase EE Basal Metabolic Rate meal , usually range 3-10 % total EE ( depend composition meal ) . Whilst cornerstone approach weight control focused strategy reduce energy intake increase physical activity , still escalate obesity level show approach ineffective long term possibly due poor long-term compliance dietary regime adequate physical activity . Thus increasingly recognise sustainable long-term strategy reduce obesity make small diet lifestyle change would positively influence energy regulatory mechanism target prevent positive energy balance . It also recognise genetic predisposition slow mechanism characterise slow metabolic rate capacity fat oxidation also determine individual 's propensity weight gain . Furthermore , study show weight loss reduce food intake result attenuation EE possibly due loss lean mass improve metabolic efficiency . The regular consumption high DIT food could increase EE fat oxidation whilst circumvent energy spar mechanism may significant potential long-term weight control . Indeed study demonstrate pronounced obesity mouse whose DIT mechanism inactivate indicate important role thermogenesis play weight control Food component chilli ( capsaicin ) , ginger , mustard , pepper , caffeine , green tea ( flavanols ) medium-chain triglyceride demonstrate increase DIT . The thermogenic effect compound show mainly via sympathetic nervous system . Pharmacological agent ephedrine salicylate well food constituent methylxanthines ( theophylline caffeine ) caffeine show possess sympathomimetic property induce fat oxidation thermogenesis effector cell stimulate release noradrenalin . Flavanoids green tea catechin also show stimulate pathway . Sympathetically release noradrenalin show activate Beta3adrenoceptors thereby induce thermogenesis fat oxidation peripheral tissue well activate uncouple protein ( UCP1 ) mediate thermogenesis brown adipose tissue ( BAT ) . Plant phenolic also show demonstrate thermogenic effect , particularly Oleuropein , green tea catechin , Kaempferol , flavanol glycoside , stilbenes quercetin . The objective present pilot study ass thermogenic effect plant food native Scotland contain phytochemical . Specifically , study investigate thermogenic effect berry ( blackberry [ Rubus sp . ] , blueberry [ Vaccinium corymbosum ] red raspberry [ Rubus idaeus L ] ) , wild garlic ( Allium ursinum ) sea buckthorn ( Hippophae rhamnoides ) . Blackberries , blueberry raspberry show rich flavonoid phenolic include catechin raspberry ketone suggest thermogenic . These berry also rich anthocyanins cyanidin-3-glucoside show potentially promote thermogenesis upregulating UCP1 . Furthermore , blueberry show good source stilbenes resveratrol pterostilbene demonstrate thermic effect elsewhere . Similarly , sea buckthorn report contain catechin , epicatechins flavonols isorhamnetin , quercetin kaempferol . Sea buckthorn also rich carotenoid , especially provitamin A activity show upregulate expression UCP1 thereby influence thermogenesis . Wild garlic contains Sulphur contain compound alliin Allicin derivative ( diallyldisulphide ) study use garlic show thermogenic activity enhance noradrenalin secretion stimulate brown adipose tissue . Indeed total thiosulfinate content wild garlic show comparable garlic . The presence thermogenic compound plant product logically suggest may thermic effect human form rationale present study . No study investigate thermic effect food human therapeutic potential weight control thermogenesis perspective . The propose pilot study provide preliminary data thermic effect Scottish food provide basis future research .</detailed_description>
