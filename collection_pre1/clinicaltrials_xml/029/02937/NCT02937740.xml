	<brief_title>Open-Label Study , Evaluating Patient Satisfaction Symptom Improvement When Treating Male Hypogonadism With Natesto™</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective study measure patient satisfaction testosterone replacement therapy ( non-naïve patient ) , treatment NATESTO . The secondary objective study evaluate following : - Improvement hypogonadism symptom ; - Patient treatment preference versus prior testosterone replacement therapy ; - Frequency daily dose NATESTO ; - Safety monitoring . The population study adult men 18-65 year age inclusive , primary secondary hypogonadism , historical document total serum testosterone concentration ≤300 ng/dL ability provide inform consent . Eligible subject include treatment-naïve , hypogonadal patient document confirmation hypogonadism , well patient previously treat alternate topical testosterone replacement therapy ( TRT ) least three month prior selection . Participants currently receive topical testosterone replacement therapy require discontinue current testosterone treatment initiate treatment NATESTO . The approximate total duration study participation participant complete study 150 day ( ~21 week ) . This Phase 4 , multicenter study consist two study period follow : - A 90-day Treatment Period , extend 120-days subject require dose increase , participant receive 122.5 mg NATESTO ( 5.5mg testosterone ) per nostril twice daily ( BID ) 90 day . At Day 90 , treat physician ass patient 's hypogonadism symptom , review patient 's complete questionnaire base Canadian Men 's Health Foundation Multidisciplinary Guidelines endorse Canadian Urological Association Canadian Society Endocrinology Metabolism1 , decide continuation high dose frequency three-times daily ( TID ) require efficacy . For TID patient , 30-day Treatment Extension participant whose symptom adequately treat BID dose , receive 122.5 mg NATESTO TID ( 5.5mg testosterone ) per nostril . At Day 120 , TID patient return site examination , discussion symptom physician questionnaire completion . All patient blood testosterone level assess Day 90 TID patient Day 120 . - Post-study follow-up : All study patient request follow Day 150 confirm whether continued therapy NATESTO . Patient selection come result doctor 's visit routine control , prescription renewal pre-selection physician among hypogonadal patient currently receive topical testosterone replacement therapy willing participate clinical trial NATESTO , result initial consultation naïve patient . At Visit 1 , patient agree participate study come site . They provide write informed consent undergo complete physical examination , include nasal examination , medical history collection . Blood pressure , heart rate , weight , height measurement ( body mass index [ BMI ] determine ) also perform . Blood drawn local lab safety assessment . However , value already document patient file precede 6 month , value enter eCRF . Previous treatment hypogonadism ( drug nondrug ; daily dose ) record , well concomitant treatment drug nondrug therapy . Study questionnaires Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire Medication ( TSQM ) quantitative Androgen Deficiency Aging Male ( qADAM ) review subject give instruction proper completion instrument . Patients complete Part A Patient Preference Use Questionnaire . Patients also provide prescription 90-day supply study medication , NATESTO , Study Drug Access Card use payment purpose patient 's preferred pharmacy . Non-naïve participant instruct stop current topical treatment least one day 7 day prior initiation treatment NATESTO . Patients take medication simultaneously . The open-label Treatment Period consist maximum 5 study visit : 2 visit do via telephone Study Coordinator ( Visit 2 , Day 30 Visit 3 , Day 60 ) one clinic visit ( Visit 4 , Day 90 ) , last clinic visit patient place TID dose ( Visit 5 , Day 120 ) . At Visit 2 ( Day 30 ) Visit 3 ( Day 60 ) , participant require complete questionnaire ( TSQM qADAM ) telephone Study Coordinator , also ask concurrent medication AEs . At Visit 4 ( Day 90 ) , patient return site . Any unreported adverse event record . Patients undergo basic physical examination include nasal examination . Blood pressure , heart rate , weight , height measurement ( body mass index [ BMI ] determine ) record . Hypogonadism symptom assess Investigator make reference qADAM questionnaire result , patient complete TSQM . At Visit 4 ( Day 90 ) , physician 's judgment patient adequately treat twice daily ( BID ) NATESTO , physician decide whether patient . ) return previous therapy ; b . ) remain NATESTO ; c. ) consider new treatment option . The physician provide patient prescription treatment chosen . The BID patient blood draw take local laboratory safety assessment ass testosterone level . This constitute END OF TREATMENT BID subject . These adequately controlled patient complete Part B ( Non-naïve ) Part C ( Naïve ) Patient Preference Use Questionnaire . At Visit 4 ( Day 90 ) , physician 's judgement twice daily ( BID ) dose NATESTO adequate treat patient 's symptoms believe patient benefit high dose , prescription give patient three time daily ( TID ) NATESTO . The Study Drug Access Card use payment purpose patient 's preferred pharmacy . These patient move TID blood draw take local laboratory ass safety well testosterone level . The patient schedule Visit 5 ( Day 120 ) time . At Visit 5 ( Day 120 TID patient ) , unreported adverse event record . Patients undergo basic physical examination include nasal examination . Blood pressure , heart rate , weight , height measurement ( body mass index [ BMI ] determine ) record . The patient blood draw take local laboratory safety assessment ass testosterone level . In addition TSQM qADAM questionnaire , subject also complete Part B ( Non-naïve ) Part C ( Naïve ) Patient Preference Use Questionnaire . The physician decide whether patient . ) return previous therapy ; b . ) remain NATESTO ; c. ) consider new treatment option . The physician provide patient prescription treatment chosen . At Visit 6 ( Day 150 ) , study patient ask telephone whether still take NATESTO ( ) .</detailed_description>
