	<brief_summary>The majority people stroke demonstrate mobility limitation , may reduce physical activity level . Task-specific train show effective intervention improve mobility individual stroke , however , little known impact intervention level physical activity . The main objective investigate efficacy task-specific training , focus upper low limb , improve physical activity level mobility individual stroke . The secondary objective investigate effect training , improve muscle strength , exercise capacity , quality life . A randomized control trial blind assessment assign eligible participant either : 1 ) experimental group 2 ) control group . Participants receive intervention three time per week 12 week . The experimental group undertake task-specific training , control group undertake global stretch memory exercise , health education session . Primary outcome include measure physical activity level mobility , whereas secondary outcome muscle strength , exercise capacity , quality life . The outcome measure baseline , 12 week post-intervention , four 12 week follow-up . The finding trial potential provide important insight regard effect task-specific training , focus upper low limb , prevent secondary post-stroke complication improve participant ' general health change physical activity level .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The sample size calculate consider result Timed Up Go test report Yang et al. , involve task-specific training program individual chronic phase stroke . The Timed Up Go test score control experimental group baseline 14.3±7s 14.6±7.4s , 14.4±6.7s 12.9±6.5s , respectively . Significant within between-group difference observe difference within experimental group -1.7±1.1s . Based upon value , sample size 16 subject per group , i.e . total 32 participant , would require , consider significance level ( α ) 5 % power 0.80 . Based assumption 15 % participant may drop course study , target 38 participant total set , 19 per group . Data analysis perform SPSS Windows® ( release 17.0 , SPSS Inc. , Chicago , IL , USA ) . Descriptive statistic carried-out outcome variable . Differences group baseline investigate independent Student 's t-tests variable related demographic clinical characteristic . If difference group baseline exist , analysis covariance use eliminate influence extraneous factor . The effect intervention analyse two way , namely data collect intention-to-treat analysis , last available value drop-outs carry forward represent miss data . Analyses variance repeat measure ( 2x4 ) employ investigate mean interaction effect group ( intervention x control ) time ( pre- , post-interventions , follow ups ) primary physical activity level mobility outcomes follow secondary outcome : muscular strength , exercise capacity , SSQOL score . Group description present mean SD , effect size 95 % confidence interval report . The effect size calculate determine magnitude difference group . The difference two mean value express unit SD , express Cohen 's , mean result experimental group minus mean result control group , divide SD control group . Effect size 0.2 0.5 consider small ; 0.5 0.8 , medium ; 0.8 , large .</detailed_description>
