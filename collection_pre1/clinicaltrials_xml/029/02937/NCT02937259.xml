	<brief_title>Self-admission : A New Treatment Approach Patients With Severe Eating Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There approximately 100 000 individual Sweden suffer eat disorder anorexia nervosa bulimia nervosa . The course disorder often prolonged lead endure disability many year . Some patient require lengthy period inpatient care , relapse discharge common . Unfortunately , still little evidence concern optimal model inpatient care patient suffer severe endure eat disorder ( SE-ED ) unlike psychiatry general , hospitalization rate SE-ED patient markedly reduce past decade . In Norway , novel treatment concept psychiatric patient place ten year : self-admission . In self-admission , patient well-known service high previous utilization health care offer possibility self-admission inpatient ward seven day without motive admission question . Patients free admit deteriorate mental health , acute stress , lack structure everyday life , loneliness , boredom , reason . The patient decide want admit discharge time . The purpose behind self-admission model increase availability inpatient care severely ill patient , avoid stressful possibly destructive visit emergency service , decrease total inpatient care utilization . Patients offer contract self-admission usually history repeat prolonged hospitalization . By encourage monitor mental health status allow seek help swiftly feel poorly , delay first sign deterioration admission minimize full-blown relapse avoid , ultimately reduce total time spend hospital . The Norwegian result promise . Self-admission lead increased patient participation compliance , strengthen patient ' ability handle symptom everyday life , clearly reduce total time spend inpatient care . The total time spend non-voluntary inpatient care number violent threaten episode ward also reduce . Until , project self-admission mainly targeted patient long-standing psychotic disorder , schizophrenia , bipolar disorder . Starting August 2014 , three-year clinical project Stockholm Centre Eating Disorders ( SCÄ ) begin offer self-admission patient SE-ED ( mainly anorexia nervosa , common diagnosis SCÄ inpatient ward ) . The overall goal self-admission project SCÄ create high-quality treatment approach also cost-effective . The relatively brief nature self-admissions course allow full-scale weight restoration achievement long-term treatment goal . Instead , admission concept probably best use booster opportunity provide short respite stressful life situation risk relapse elevate . In way , offer brief inpatient treatment preemptory tool make use rather `` necessary evil '' severe mental breakdown already occur increase patient participation , agency , self-awareness , autonomy . Furthermore , bypass traditional clinician-led decision-making evaluate whether inpatient treatment occur could also foster reflection subjective motif barrier ask help . Here , self-admission promotes partnership patient clinician instead distrust . The approach could enhance self-knowledge motivation , extension , foster skill strategy influence course prognosis disorder . It show patient suffer anorexia nervosa request inpatient treatment initial period reinforcement inherent disorder pass part personal process increase awareness . As gradually become aware loss control eat disorder symptom ambivalence towards change , also become less reluctant ask assistance regain control . For patient long-standing illness process may take several year . It hypothesize process could solidify hastened offering patient concrete tool form self-admission , also required practice self-monitoring develop agency . The current program first kind offer self-admission patient eat disorder . If model prove successful , hopefully establish standard tool treatment patient SE-ED . However , health economics analysis critical determine whether model merit broad implementation . The potential health economic benefit evident : low health care cost specific patient group , increase availability much seek hospital bed `` regular '' patient queue ward , improve patient ' chance maintain everyday activity function family life work , lower rate sick leave , etc . For preliminary duration three year , two ten bed inpatient ward SCÄ reserve self-admission ; i.e . occupy regularly admit patient available patient self-admission contract , may admit maximum seven day time . Participants also free discharge . Upon arrival ward , see nurse brief discussion current status treatment goal assess medical doctor point ( unless ward nurse deem necessary due acute medical impairment , suicidal communication etc. ) . There restriction total number admission episode regard necessary patient contract also admit long period time regular admission . The aim include total 20-40 patient program . Inclusion criterion simple : offer contract , patient must well-known clinic , must receive inpatient treatment ward least previous three year , must willing able follow basic treatment structure ward . Exclusion criterion active suicidal self-injurious behavior active substance use disorder ; however , body mass index ( BMI ) criterion apply . In effect , mean patient consider inclusion suffer SE-ED many hospitalize several previous occasion . Most patient program probably present clinical picture treatment-refractory anorexia nervosa rule patient severe bulimia nervosa may able make use concept well . In order evaluate clinical self-admission project thoroughly , broad number method employ . The following data collect : At inclusion : - RAND-36 ( RAND Corporation version SF-36 ( Short Form Health Survey ) ) ; quality life questionnaire . - EQ-5D ( EuroQol Health Questionnaire ) ; health experience questionnaire . - Two question inpatient care experience expectation project participation . At six month : • Semi-structured record patient interview concern subjective experience self-admission . The interview manual , design specifically study , consist set open-ended question several area interest regard participant experience . The interview conduct `` open '' discussion topic interviewer continuously check area cover . The recorded interview transcribe computer software NVivo use conduct qualitative content analysis , group interview material similar node theme . At one year : - RAND-36 . - EQ-5D . - Number day spend inpatient care ( SCÄ well clinic ) . - Number day spend involuntary inpatient care ( SCÄ well clinic ) . - Number outpatient visit ( SCÄ well clinic ) . - Diagnoses give rise inpatient care/outpatient visit . - Current medication prescription . - Number day social security benefit ( sick leave work/school , disability pension similar model ) . At three year : - Same data collect one year . - Semi-structured recorded patient interview concern subjective experience self-admission . Data health care consumption ( SCÄ ) , diagnose , medication , social security benefit collect National Board Health Welfare Statistics Sweden , respectively . In addition , participant assess follow psychiatric scales/questionnaires inclusion one- three-year follow-up : - SCID-5-CV ( Structured Clinical Interview DSM-5 Disorders - Clinician Version ) ; assessment psychiatric co-morbidity . - SEDI ( Structured Eating Disorder Interview ) ; assessment occurrence clinical eating disorder . - GAF ( Global Assessment Functioning ) ; assessment global function , previous axis V DSM-IV . - PSRS ( Psychiatric Status Rating Scale Eating Disorders ) ; assessment eat disorder severity . - EDE-Q ( Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire ) ; self-assessment central diagnostic component eat disorder . - CIA ( Clinical Impairment Assessment ) ; assessment secondary disability due eat disorder . - CPRS ( Comprehensive Psychiatric Rating Scale ) ; self-assessment psychiatric symptom . - SASB ( Structural Analysis Social Behavior ) ; self-assessment self-image . There randomization ; instead , every single patient function control , individual data health care consumption etc . study period compare retrospective data amount time ( thus , three year ) proceed inclusion self-admission project . Since patient study well know clinic , retrospective data ready available patient file . Regarding health economics evaluation , cost-benefit analysis perform base collect data quality life , disease progression , health care consumption , medication , social security benefit , etc . Changes availability hospital bed inpatient ward SCÄ `` regular '' patient without self-admission contract also analyze . Hypothetically , reserve two bed self-admission thus reduce number regular bed , overall availability may also negatively affect . On hand , establish `` fast lane '' high consumer inpatient care thereby remove general admission queue , wait list may ultimately reduce . An estimation statistical power , assume standard deviation base effect size find previous review Norwegian data ( multiplied factor 3 order achieve conservative estimate ) , suggest power well 80 % ( approx . 98 % ) . As customary , separate power estimation make health economics evaluation point largely base clinical effect data . The time plan clinical self-admission project follow : - Autumn 2014 : The clinical pilot project start first patient include . - 2015 : Patient interview six month . One-year follow-up first patient project . - 2016 : Half-time evaluation end year . - 2018 : The clinical pilot project end temporary clinical evaluation perform . Project participant , however , include successively entire period thus , research part project ( data collection analysis ) proceed additional three year , i.e . 2020 : - 2017 : Analysis combine 12-month quantitative data . Qualitative content analysis 6-month interview . - 2018 : Cost-benefit analysis 12-month data . - 2019-2020 : Analysis combine quantitative 36-month data . Qualitative content analysis 36-month interview . Cost-benefit analysis 36-month data . This study produce four separate sub-studies : 1 . Qualitative interview study patient experience self-admission program 6 month 2 . Analysis change health care consumption pattern , eat disorder severity quality life 12 month 3 . Health economics analysis 12 month 4 . Analysis change health care consumption pattern , eat disorder severity quality life , include health economics analysis , 36 month</detailed_description>
