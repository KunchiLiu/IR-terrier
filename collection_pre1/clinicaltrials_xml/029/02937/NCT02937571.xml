	<criteria>Newly diagnose patient histologically confirm MM base follow criterion : Clonal plasma cell bone marrow Measurable disease within past 4 week define one following : Serum monoclonal protein ≥ 1.0 g/dL Urine monoclonal protein &gt; 200 mg/24 hour Involved serum immunoglobulin free light chain &gt; 10 mg/dL AND abnormal kappa/lambda ratio Evidence underlying end organ damage and/or myeloma define event attribute underlying plasma cell proliferative disorder meeting least one following : Hypercalcemia : serum calcium &gt; 0.25 mmol/L ( &gt; 1 mg/dL ) upper limit normal ≥ 2.75 mmol/L ( 11 mg/dL ) Anemia : hemoglobin value &lt; 10 g/dL &gt; 2 g/dL low limit normal Bone disease : ≥ 1 lytic lesion skeletal Xray , CT , PETCT . For patient 1 lytic lesion , bone marrow demonstrate ≥10 % clonal plasma cell Clonal bone marrow plasma cell percentage ≥60 % Involved/uninvolved serum free light chain ratio ≥100 involve free light chain &gt; 100 mg/L . 1 focal lesion magnetic resonance imaging study ( lesion must &gt; 5 mm ) size Creatinine Clearance ≥ 60 ml/min . CrCl measure estimate use CockcroftGault method Age ≥ 18 year time signing informed consent documentation Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 02 Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.0 K/uL , hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL , platelet count ≥ 75 K/uL , unless cytopenia deem due disease discretion clinical investigator . Transfusions growth factor permissible . Adequate hepatic function , bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN , AST ALT &lt; 3.0 x ULN . All study participant must able tolerate one follow thromboprophylactic strategy : aspirin , low molecular weight heparin warfarin ( coumadin ) alternative anticoagulant . All study participant must register mandatory eREMS® program , willing able comply requirement REMS® . Females childbearing potential ( FCBP ) † must negative serum urine pregnancy test within 10 14 day within 24 hour prior prescribe lenalidomide Cycle 1 ( prescription must fill within 7 day ) must either commit continued abstinence heterosexual intercourse begin TWO acceptable method birth control , one highly effective method one additional effective method AT THE SAME TIME , least 28 day start take lenalidomide . FCBP must also agree ongoing pregnancy test . Men must agree use latex condom sexual contact FCBP even successful vasectomy . A female childbearing potential sexually mature female : 1 ) undergone hysterectomy bilateral oophorectomy ; 2 ) naturally postmenopausal least 24 consecutive month ( i.e. , menses time precede 24 consecutive month ) . Patients receive &gt; 1 cycle prior treatment concurrent systemic treatment multiple myeloma . Treatment hypercalcemia spinal cord compression aggressively progress myeloma current prior corticosteroid permit Bisphosphonates permit Concurrent prior treatment corticosteroid indication multiple myeloma permit Prior treatment radiotherapy permit Prior treatment smolder myeloma permit washout period 4 week last dose . Smoldering patient previously treat carfilzomib exclude . Patients measurable disease receive one cycle therapy within 60 day washout period 4 week last dose ( trial outside trial ) eligible Plasma cell leukemia POEMS syndrome Amyloidosis Pregnant lactate female . Because potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother carfilzomib combination lenalidomide . These potential risk may also apply agent use study . Uncontrolled hypertension diabetes Active hepatitis B C infection Known suspect HIV serologically positive Has significant cardiovascular disease NYHA Class III IV symptom , EF &lt; 40 % hypertrophic cardiomyopathy , restrictive cardiomyopathy , myocardial infarction within 6 month prior enrollment , unstable angina , unstable arrhythmia determine history physical examination . Echocardiogram perform screen evaluation . Moderate severe pulmonary hypertension define PASP &gt; 50mm Hg Has refractory GI disease refractory nausea/vomiting , inflammatory bowel disease , bowel resection would prevent absorption oral agent Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include limited active infection psychiatric illness/social situation would compromise compliance study requirement Significant neuropathy ≥Grade 3 Grade 2 neuropathy pain baseline Contraindication concomitant medication , include antiviral anticoagulation Major surgery within 3 week prior first dose</criteria>
