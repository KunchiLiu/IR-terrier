	<detailed_description>The development cervical dysplasia ( precursor cervical cancer ) cervical cancer require infection one several cancer cause subtypes human papilloma virus ( HPV ) . There 100 subtypes HPV , cancer causing . In past , North American data show 70 % early cervical cancer associate HPV subtypes 16 and/or 18 . The first HPV vaccine approve protected common subtypes HPV 16 18 . The traditional HPV vaccination consist 3-doses administer 6 month period . Since 8 year introduction vaccine , study analyze HPV subtype change . It important determine prevalence HPV subtypes associate precancerous and/or early cervical cancer change , preventative outcome arise HPV vaccination . This implication regard importance anticipated effect immunization nanovalent vaccine include oncogenic subtypes . This study look tissue sample see frequency HPV 16/18 subtypes change female population today , introduction HPV vaccine . It compare woman expose HPV vaccine .</detailed_description>
