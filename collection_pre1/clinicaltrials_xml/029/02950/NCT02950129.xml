	<brief_summary>The subject undergo specific physical exam test report diagnostic sacroiliac joint ( SIJ ) pain prior receiving routine injection SIJ perform part normal medical care . Routine care involve use number test , n't routinely include assessment 6 test patient 's treatment . The subject fill Visual Analog Scale pain pain draw prior injection . The test repeat injection . The investigator propose investigate cluster test propose Laslett well compare result ASLR Gillet Test SIJ injection determine validity test low back patient present injection think sacroiliac joint . The secondary purpose would development clinical predictor rule determine examination characteristic patient may benefit intraarticular injection SIJ .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>IRB-HSR # 14073 Investigation Pelvic Girdle Dysfunction Low Back Pain Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Low back pain subject extensive research past 10 year . Some effort focus effectiveness diagnostic test determine etiology low back pain . One component low back pain clinically sacroiliac joint ( SIJ ) dysfunction . The prevalence sacroiliac pain low back pain population report approximately 10 30 % . The diagnosis sacroiliac pain area controversy literature poor inter-tester intra-rater reliability describe motion test . More recently , cluster provocation test describe predictive diagnosis sacroiliac dysfunction . Laslett et al suggest SI pain provocation test use examination include cluster six test . When three six test two four select test positive , show best predictive power diagnose SIJ pain . The `` gold standard '' diagnose SIJ pain study pain relief intra-articular local anesthetic block injection . When six provocation test provoke patient 's typical pain , SIJ rule source current low back pain . Pelvic girdle pain include SIJ dysfunction investigate post partum population . The Active Straight Leg Raise ( ASLR ) show reliable post partum pelvic pain . This test think help assess hypermobility SIJ . This test positive likelihood ratio ( +LR ) = 14.5 negative likelihood ratio ( -LR ) = .14 indicates good test rule rule pelvic girdle pain pregnancy . This test think help assess dysfunction SIJ . The Gillet test recently report indicate abnormal biomechanics stance side Hungerford et al . Increased hamstring activation stance leg identify indicative abnormal SI motion . These two test ( ASLR Gillet ) think reflective SIJ instability abnormal movement , respectively , pregnancy low back patient .</detailed_description>
