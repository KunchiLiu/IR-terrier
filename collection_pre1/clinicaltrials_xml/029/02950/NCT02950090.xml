	<brief_title>MobilWise : Mobile Phone Remote Coaching After Worksite Joint ADventure Exposure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Because US population age obesity rise dramatically , epidemic arthritis-associated disability associate cost significantly worsen , largely due consequence knee osteoarthritis ( OA ) . Knee OA already major cause work disability work absenteeism/presenteeism , especially among obese overweight employee . In addition , total knee replacement surgery increase 161.5 % among Medicare participant past 20 year expect quadruple next 20 year . Increased physical activity relieve pain activity limitation individual knee OA , healthy lifestyle behavior embrace substantial proportion employ population . The overarching goal program develop disseminate affordable , efficient , efficacious physical activity intervention assist large group employee risk knee OA attain maintain healthy physical activity behavior . MobilWise 12-week RCT pilot use data transmit affordable accelerometer-based personal monitor ( Fitbit Flex ) via customize remote- coach interface 1 ) allow remote coach view collect physical activity data generate personal monitor , 2 ) use data formulate provide tailor behavioral support via mobile phone , ba sed supportive accountability model use motivational interviewing . The MobilWise intervention use medium communication mode prefer participant ( text , voice call , video chat ) attain sustain healthy physical activity behavior Blue Cross Blue Shield Illinois employee knee symptom previous completion in-person , intensive intervention ( Joint ADventure ) . Six month follow-up measure plan . Specific aim : 1 ) ass feasibility conduct randomize controlled trial Mobil Wise intervention worksite , 2 ) estimate effectiveness intervention increase objectively-measured physical activity , 3 ) develop/refine customize remote coach-interface , dashboard , coach protocol , 4 ) examine accuracy affordable personal monitor ( Fitbit Flex ) compare output data state-of-the-art GT3X+ accelerometer . This study leverage combine clinical technologic expertise Northwestern 's Arthritis Center Accelerometer Unit Center Behavioral Intervention Technologies , cooperation Fitbit technology team Blue Cross Blue Shield Illinois Corporation . If successful , multi-site randomize control trial/R01 proposal follow demonstrate effectiveness/cost-effectiveness Mobil Wise intervention large worksite population . Given influence BCBS shape future health practice scalability/generalizability propose intervention , research could tremendous impact improve symptom quality life early knee OA well prevent work absenteeism/presenteeism , work disability , increase healthcare cost associate knee OA .</detailed_description>
