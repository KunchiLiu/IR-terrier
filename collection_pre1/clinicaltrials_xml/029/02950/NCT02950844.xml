	<brief_summary>Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) common sustain heart rhythm abnormality . Its incidence increase partly due age population refer grow epidemic . AF result irregular contraction heart cause unpleasant symptom palpitation increase risk stroke , heart failure death . Percutaneous catheter ablation safe treatment option symptomatic patient AF . The success rate procedure improve time due well understand AF , development new technique technology , great physician experience . However , success rate procedure still remain around 70 % . This contribute limited ability find area drive AF . STAR map novel map system develop view well identifying site drive AF , take account mechanism AF already demonstrate . Data study use refine identification driver fibrillation leave atrium enormous potential simplify ablation improve success rate thereby reduce need procedure . To well validate mapping system investigator also aim use participant atrial tachycardia ( AT ) , heart rhythm abnormality mechanism readily identify exist map system use clinical practice . The investigator demonstrate STAR map algorithm effectively map AT . To gain understanding change occur leave upper chamber heart context AF half participant AF undergo cardiac magnetic resonance image assess presence scar . This enhance understand atrial remodelling promotes AF , may point way modify process prevent AF .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>AF catheter ablation success rate still limit around 70 % large proportion patient require procedure remain normal heart rhythm . The current strategy use catheter ablation AF involve target pulmonary vein enter left side upper chamber heart . The supportive evidence target area beyond pulmonary vein remain mixed . Thereby exist map system sit potentially drive AF effectively identify . Further , also suggest site intermittent mobile nature make difficult effectively map . With mind investigator develop STAR mapping , novel mapping system take factor account . The purpose study use map system prospectively effectively map ablate driver AF identify termination and/or slow AF catheter ablation . Participants document AF present time le 24 month i.e . early persistent AF refer catheter ablation AF Electrophysiologist recruit study . Participants undergo consent procedure involvement research study . The procedure conduct either local anaesthetic/sedation general anaesthetic depend clinical need patient . During procedure tube pass left upper chamber heart groin . Through tubes catheter use create geometry heart chamber . Following , half participant basket catheter 64 electrode position upper chamber whilst conventional catheter use half participant . This demonstrate mapping system effectively use variety map catheter . The signal collect use novel map system identify sit potential driver AF . These site target response ablation record particularly look slow and/or termination AF , support site identify driver . As part validation phase study participant schedule catheter ablation AT Electrophysiologist enrol study . The STAR map generate case compare map generate conventional system . This enable validation STAR mapping system . The mapping system use study CARTOFINDER ( CARTO , Biosense Webster , Inc , CA ) . Analyses use map system allow sub-study identifying mechanism AT driver AF use CARTOFINDER system .</detailed_description>
