	<brief_summary>This research study evaluate new type Kidney Cancer vaccine call `` Personalized NeoAntigen Cancer Vaccine '' possible treatment Kidney Cancer . The following intervention involve study : - Personalized Neoantigen Vaccine - Poly-ICLC ( Hiltonol ) - Ipilimumab</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Combining NeoVax , Personalized NeoAntigen Cancer Vaccine , With Ipilimumab Treat High-risk Renal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study Phase I clinical trial , test safety investigational kidney cancer vaccine also try define appropriate dose investigational kidney cancer vaccine use study . `` Investigational '' mean kidney cancer vaccine , case Personalized Neoantigen Cancer Vaccine , study . It also mean FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve Personalized Cancer Vaccine use patient , include people kidney cancer . Poly-ICLC ( also call Hiltonol ) experimental `` viral mimic '' activator immunity . Poly-ICLC investigational drug , mean FDA approve treatment disease . Personalized NeoAntigen Cancer Vaccine : The purpose study determine possible make administer safely vaccine kidney cancer use information gain specific characteristic participant 's kidney cancer . It known kidney cancer mutation ( change genetic material ) specific individual patient tumor . These mutation cause tumor cell produce protein appear different body 's cell . It possible protein use vaccine may induce strong immune response , may help participant 's body fight tumor cell could cause kidney cancer come back future . The study examine safety vaccine give several different time point examine participant 's blood cell sign vaccine induce immune response . Ipilimumab ( Yervoy™ ) antibody approve United States Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment melanoma . In research study , investigator look safety tolerability Personalized NeoAntigen Cancer Vaccine combine Ipilimumab well body 's immune response vaccine . Ipilimumab deliver injection give underneath skin rather inject vein proximity vaccination site order 1 ) direct anti-CTLA4 activity vaccine-draining lymph node 2 ) limit potential toxic effect .</detailed_description>
