	<brief_summary>Lactated Ringer 's ( LR ) solution bolus commonly administer emergency department set seriously ill patient . It also common obtain blood sample determine serum lactate level aid assessment patient 's degree illness . This study endeavor determine serum lactate level affect LR fluid administration healthy adult individual compare receive Normal Saline ( NS ) . Healthy adult volunteer use subject illness hospital patient confound result .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Does Intravenous Lactated Ringer Solution Raise Measured Serum Lactate ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methods : Approximately 30 subject randomize either Lactated Ringer 's group Placebo group . The study power detect difference 0.3mmol/L pre- post-treatment lactate level . All subject healthy volunteer 18 year old . Healthy volunteer define subject acute symptom meet exclusionary criterion : - Pregnancy currently breast-feeding - Prisoner status - Those history clinical condition associate fluid overload : congestive heart failure , renal , hepatic failure - Baseline serum lactate level &gt; 2.2mmol - Baseline creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg/dL All volunteer sign write consent , approve Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) . The consent form discus risk benefit study . The benefit study identify possible confounder current interpretation serum lactate . By clarify whether Lactated Ringer 's fluid contribute measure serum lactate level hope improve care septic patient patient abnormal vital sign elevate serum lactate level diagnosis sepsis consider . The risk study include possible development fluid overload state pulmonary edema . We believe sequelae would unlikely occur since exclude anyone history clinical condition associate fluid overload . The intended pool volunteer subject resident , attending , hospital staff , medical student hospital . Only healthy volunteer ( describe previously ) allow participate . Volunteer subject hospital instructed participate work shifts day work interfere job duty . The consent form clearly specify participation study impact academic status employment . The subject also fill short data collection form age , gender , know medical problem , medication , allergy . The subject designate weight consent form . All subject receive 18-gauge IV one antecubital fossa . A second IV place contralateral arm draw serum study . The subject randomize Lactated Ringer 's arm receive 30ml/kg Lactated Ringer 's solution run wide open . Those randomized Placebo group receive 30ml/kg normal saline wide open . The precise fluid bolus quantity determine use measure patient 's weight kilogram multiply 30 , round final figure near 100ml simplicity . ( E.g . 2077 ml would round 2100ml . ) The pharmacist study randomly assign subject treatment group ensure equal number subject Lactated Ringer 's arm Placebo arm . The pharmacist obscure fluid bag content investigator maintain blinding . Only pharmacist know treatment subject receive . The person administer medication analysis data know study number patient , blind pharmacist 's randomization . We choose bolus 30ml/kg Lactated Ringer 's solution one hour regimen two reason primarily . The first clinical scenario sepsis septic shock 30ml/kg bolus typical . [ 2 ] Therefore protocol simulate actually happen care septic patient . A second reason selection substantial quantity LR give short time interval ensure detection change serum lactate concentration secondary fluid bolus , one found . A small quantity LR short time span may result false negative result . A serum lactate level drawn prior initiate treatment . Any subject find abnormally high baseline serum lactate level ( &gt; 2.2 mmol/L ) treatment exclude study . The lactate measure five minute conclusion intravenous fluid treatment . 5ml blood waste clear line prior blood draw . Lactate measure point-of-care meter ( iSTAT-1 analyzer ) . The before-treatment after-treatment lactate level compare see Lactated Ringer 's cause significant rise ( &gt; 0.3 mmol/L ) lactate level point data collection period . The study design describe previously lend brief investigation important clinical phenomenon fluid resuscitation investigate secondary outcome study . One consideration use Lactated Ringer 's solution clinically incidence hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis use normal saline fluid resuscitation . [ 8 ] Using point-of-care meter ( iSTAT 1 analyzer ) measure serum lactate also complete metabolic panel prior subsequent delivery 30 ml/kg fluid administration . We subsequently analyze change serum sodium , chloride , potassium , bicarbonate treatment group , assess degree derangement occur electrolyte , specifically evaluate trend toward hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis normal saline group . While patient process receive IV fluid , keep continuous cardiac oxygenation monitoring . We believe highly unlikely subject need medical care study . However , let noted attend and/or resident physician present time patient receive treatment . Should subject develop adverse effect result study , physician ass patient offer register emergency department . Any Serious Adverse Event ( SAE ) report IRB within 5 day . In order protect privacy research subject maintain confidentiality data , data handle research assistant investigator store secure cabinet password protect computer file lock research office . All research assistants investigator HIPAA-trained credentialed UMC IRB . We choose goal sample size 30 base follow calculation . A sample size 25 achieve 80 % power detect mean pair difference 0.3 know standard deviation difference 0.5 significance level ( alpha ) 0.05 use one-sided paired t-test . To allow patient drop equipment failure , aim enroll 30 patient .</detailed_description>
