	<detailed_description>B . BACKGROUND : Nearly five million Americans experience heart failure ( HF ) great 250,000 die annually . 1 The prevalence continue increase age US population HF lead cause hospitalization among adult &gt; 65 United state . Despite remarkable improvement medical therapy , prognosis patient myocardial failure remain poor , almost 20 % patient die within 1 year initial diagnosis &gt; 80 % 8-year mortality . 2 In addition patient admit hospital heart failure 50 % readmission rate within six month discharge . 3,4 These patient require routine clinical care often require diagnostic therapeutic procedure . This project seek ass use hemodynamic ( HD ) monitoring technology ( ClearSight/Nexfin ) currently use intraoperative critical care setting provide additional patient benefit use longitudinally patient ' `` routine '' medical care . This project design assess impact non-invasive hemodynamic monitoring technology improve care heart failure patient . Currently , patient assess outpatient set routine ability ass hemodynamics related contractility ( dp/dt , stroke volume , cardiac output ) vascular resistance . Rather , health care provider relies patient history , physical exam , static vital sign ( heart rate blood pressure ) make patient care decision . This despite large body evidence suggest poor marker determine cardiac function volume status . The investigator seek `` assist '' management high-risk patient provide `` routine '' parameter contractility vascular resistance ( via ClearSight/Nexfin ) system health care provider patient ' clinic visit . Nexfin system This device provide continuous blood pressure monitor parameter heart function ( stroke volume , cardiac output , stroke volume variation , systemic vascular resistance dp/dt ) via finger cuff contain photo-plethysmograph sensor monitor arterial volume pressure . The sensor small , 6 3 cm cuff , place middle finger ( see picture ) . The parameter device validate traditional non-invasive blood pressure measurements 5 traditional cardiac output assessment device 6 . The device inflate pressure allow assessment pulsatility artery digit . It important note device significantly reduce perfusion digit FDA approve two hour continuous use ( www . http : //www.edwards.com/eu/products/mininvasive/pages/clearsightsystem.aspx ) . For study device place patient 5 minute . Figure 1 : ClearSight / Nexfin System C. STUDY HYPOTHESIS &amp; AIMS This study seek assess utility `` routine '' flow guide HD monitoring via Nexfin system patient known heart failure . Patients enrol study include classified New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Functional Classification three great Objective Assessment Classification B great . Once consent , patient device place 5 minute clinic visit . The care team data display evaluate device . It important note study observational survey study evaluate heart failure specialist find device useful . The data show team use guide treatment captured chart . Rather clinician survey evaluate clinical utility device ( see primary outcome marker ) . It hope investigator heart failure specialist report find device useful base result study . If investigator submit research study ( new IRB submission ) evaluate clinical impact implement device set . Outcome data collect use electronic medical record . The primary marker heart failure clinician ' evaluation survey hemodynamic device . Secondary marker include : patient comfort survey result , heart failure classification , renal function , blood pressure , cardiac function test , pulmonary function test . Patients ' medical record review six month consent secondary ensure relevant cardiac pulmonary function test capture correlate data Nexfin system . Figure 2 : New York Heart Association Heart Failure Classification D : RESEARCH METHODOLOGY/STUDY PROCEDURES Study Protocol : Phase 1 : The initial phase study involve 2-month trial period ClearSight/Nexfin device use consented patient . This period allow provider become familiar device determine logistics outpatient set best suit two study device available week . In addition , health care provider fill survey ( included submission ) consent patient , evaluate utility device . As technology limit resource ( 2 device available ) , survey allow research team determine provider clinical setting maximize utility carry describe study protocol . E. INVESTIGATIONAL DEVICE : The investigational device test study . The ClearSight/Nexfin System FDA approve device widely use perioperative setting . To restate , study similar assess utility outpatient heart failure clinic . All device use study clear biomedical engineering prior use per hospital equipment protocol . 9 . DATA COLLECTION How patient data collect store ? Data collect include clinical document ( Both paper electronic ) , electronic patient medical record , patient comfort survey , physician survey . Who responsible collection study data ? The department research coordinator research manager control access study data . The team research assistant collect store research data ( paper electronic ) secure lock area . All patient electronic research data store research Intranet monitor protected university .</detailed_description>
