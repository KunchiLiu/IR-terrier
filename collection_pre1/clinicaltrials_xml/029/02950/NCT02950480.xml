	<brief_title>Breast Capsular Contracture Following Post-Mastectomy Reconstruction Women Treated With Leukotriene Inhibitor Zafirlukast : A Phase II Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A 2 arm , 90 patient ( 45 per cohort ) trial patient breast cancer undergo mastectomy immediate tissue-expander reconstruction determine whether treatment zafirlukast ( 20mg PO BID ) reduce prevent development capsular contracture . Patients block randomize 1:1 two cohort : treatment zafirlukast standard care , standard care alone . Patients begin treatment zafirlukast post-operative day one follow placement tissue expander ( ) determine safe surgical recovery standpoint . They continue standard dosing ( 20mg PO twice per day ) zafirlukast expander fill ( 6-12 week , 18 week woman receive radiation ) . Treatment stop 48 hour prior expander-implant exchange , equivalent 5 half-lives drug . Patients see every 1-2 week expander fill , assess clinically base Baker classification system capsular contracture every appointment . The day surgery expander-implant exchange , Baker classification also note . During expander-implant exchange , three representative section expander capsule collect : medial , lateral anterior capsule specimen . These specimen bisect ; half send pathology half collect Munster lab . Gross microscopic determination capsule thickness perform pathology department . The Munster lab fix stain tissue look presence collagen , level fibrosis number myofibroblasts . Fibrosis level collagen presence determine perform immunohistochemistry Trichrome stain tissue , well Western blot analysis Collagen-1 . Myofibroblasts detect use immunohistochemistry commercially available antibody .</detailed_description>
