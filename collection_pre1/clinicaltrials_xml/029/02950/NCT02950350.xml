	<brief_summary>Cervical cancer common reproductive malignancy develop country . Due local invasion , radical hysterectomy perform advanced cervical cancer ( FIGO IIB - IVA ) , radiation combine chemoradiation ( RCTX ) traditional treatment nowadays . Lack precise treatment strategy , recurrent ratesand metastasisis high , 5-year survival rate le 50 % . Therefore , need explore new strategy improve prognosis advance cervical cancer . The prognosis cervical cancer closely related stage , current FIGO clinical stage subjective , example different gynecologic oncologist may give different diagnosis patient . MRI , CT , PET/CT image examination commonly use referrence clinical staging , sensitivity specificity satisfy . In addition , lymph node metastasis significantly impact prognosis cervical cancer . However , lymph node invasion current staging criterion . Precision treatment surgical staging recommend NCCN recently .Surgical stag patient advancedcervical cancer safe delay primary RCTX randomize study.Whether overall survival benefit long-term clinical follow-up surgical stag unknown.Blocking bilateral uterine artery effectively reduce tumor size increase operability , conform locally advanced cervical cancer . Furthermore , ovarian dysfunction cause RCTX could avoid ovarian transposition via surgical staging . Based , suggesta new surgical stagingfor patient advanced cervical cancer , includinglaparoscopic pelvic para-aortic lymphadenectomy , uterine blood vessel block ovarian transportation , order perform individualize postoperative RCTX , reduce tumor load , preserve ovarian function improve life quality .</brief_summary>
