	<brief_summary>This phase I/Ib trial study side effect best dose ibrutinib give together pembrolizumab see well work treat patient non-Hodgkin lymphoma come back respond treatment . Monoclonal antibody , pembrolizumab , may interfere ability cancer cell grow spread . Ibrutinib may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Given pembrolizumab ibrutinib may work well treat patient non-Hodgkin lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab Ibrutinib Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety tolerability combination ibrutinib pembrolizumab patient relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ) . II . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) recommend phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) combination ibrutinib pembrolizumab patient relapsed/refractory NHL . III . To evaluate efficacy combination ibrutinib pembrolizumab patient relapsed/refractory NHL . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine overall response rate ( ORR ) , duration response , progression-free survival overall survival combination ibrutinib pembrolizumab patient relapsed/refractory NHL . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To explore relationship prognostic parameter include ki-67 staining , PD-1 stain cell origin ( activate B-cell ABC versus germinal center B-cell GCB ) ORR combination ibrutinib pembrolizumab patient relapsed/refractory NHL . II . To determine relationship gene mutation resistance therapy combination ibrutinib pembrolizumab patient relapsed/refractory NHL ( BTK , PLC gamma 2 , PD-1 ) . III . To evaluate monitor effect B- , T- , natural killer ( NK ) -cell function combination ibrutinib pembrolizumab patient relapsed/refractory NHL . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study ibrutinib follow phase Ib study . Patients receive ibrutinib orally ( PO ) daily day 1-21 pembrolizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 17 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day , every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
