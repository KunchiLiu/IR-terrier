	<brief_summary>It common clinical practice leave small amount astigmatism uncorrected contact lens wearer . Therefore , driver astigmatism wear contact lens may experience blur driving . The purpose study determine correct small amount astigmatism contact lenses improve drive safety .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating Improving Functional Driving Vision Patients With Astigmatism : Phase 3</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose randomize control trial compare visual performance simulate drive performance adult astigmatism wear 1*DAY ACUVUE® MOIST ASTIGMATISM ( toric ) , 1*DAY ACUVUE® MOIST ( spherical control ) , 1*DAY ACUVUE® MOIST ( placebo ) contact lenses . Adult subject nearsightedness astigmatism wear three type soft contact lens ( placebo , spherical toric randomize order ) . Each subject read letter standard eye chart complete vision driving test drive simulator . Subjects repeat test lens type . Analyses include ANOVA look main effect lens condition , separate contrast compare toric vs. spherical , toric vs. placebo , spherical vs. placebo lens . Investigating lens simulate drive condition , involve eye movement demand , lend insight potential advantage toric spherical contact lenses drive safety .</detailed_description>
