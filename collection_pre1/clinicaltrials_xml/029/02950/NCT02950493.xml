	<brief_summary>Use Reactivated DEFINITY® Patients Undergoing Stress Echo Purpose study : Each patient undergo stress echocardiogram us full vial DEFINITY® contrast agent . During infusion , often condense back liquid phase due manual pressure apply syringe . At point , optimal use current ultrasound setting stress echocardiography . This research project test whether condensed DEFINITY® reactivate ultrasound use transducer use image patient . Eligibility : Same criterion require stress echo procedure . Interventions Evaluations : Inject condense DEFINITY® end stress test Follow Up : The patient would observe echo lab staff half hour follow completion stress test . There would longitudinal follow .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients undergo previously schedule stress echocardiography primary investigator supervise physician identify consent . The standard stress echocardiography procedure perform . Definity® remove refrigeration agitate 45 second vaporize gaseous phase . One mL Definity® dilute 29 mL isotonic , sterile saline . Patients undergo baseline echocardiography follow stress either dobutamine exercise . Standard Definity® inject intravenously subject via peripheral intravenous access obtain prior study register nurse end stress portion procedure coincide image acquisition . Contrast enhance echocardiography standard acoustic acquisition perform follow stress indicate diagnostic purpose test . By end exam , gaseous Definity® undergone manual compression via manual pressure condense back liquid phase . At point , compress Definity® give intravenously repeat transthoracic echocardiography . During second round image acquisition , real time ( RT ) imaging ( 35 Hertz ) 1:1 trigger ( Tr ) end systolic image various mechanical index ( MI 's ) 1.2 perform standard transthoracic echocardiography window . Acoustic Intensity ( AI ) within leave ventricular ( LV ) cavity , anterior myocardium ( AM ) inferolateral myocardium ( ILM ) end systole obtain MI set real time trigger image . Differences AI Tr RT image within AM ILM MI use quantify bubble activation/destruction . Following image acquisition , patient observe 30 minute echo lab staff nearby resuscitative equipment per current protocol . If adverse event note , patient dismiss .</detailed_description>
