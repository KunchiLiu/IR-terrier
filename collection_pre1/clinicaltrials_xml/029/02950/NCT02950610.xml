	<brief_summary>The purpose analyse human exhale breath mean device call electronic nose ( eNose ) patient non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) way non-invasive assessment liver disease.This device medically adapt clinically validated patient lung condition .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Breath Analysis Using Electronic Nose Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Human exhale breath contains 3000 volatile organic compound ( VOCs ) vary relative concentration health disease . Metabolic disorder affect liver , NAFLD , produce disproportionate organic compound produce by-product metabolism thus expire exhaled breath , excrete urine detectable blood . NAFLD prevalence increase reach epidemic proportion affect 90 % obese adult 22 % -53 % obese children.Liver biopsy gold standard diagnose NAFLD , unpleasant lead complication . There unmet need develop non-invasive method assess liver disease . Comon Invent ( Delft , Netherlands ) together respiratory department Amsterdam Medical Centre ( AMC ) , University Amsterdam , adapt electronic nose know SpiroNose prototype device clinical use . Sensitive electronic sensor detect molecule breath generate signal . Complex algorithms analytical technics allow pattern recognition breath sample different subject . Well charaterised patient select clinical category non-alcoholic fatty liver disease without cirrhosis compare healthy individual . Edinburgh site conduct study . In addition exhale breath analysis , blood urine collect study end product metabolism.Furthermore , stool urine collect subject analyse understand role gut bacteria fermentation , metabolic product result cause VOC production .</detailed_description>
