	<brief_summary>This study ask whether person lupus use uptake information service web-based lupus interactive navigator ( LIN ) regular basis whether uptake associate well self-management , improved coping , high sense control life , overall improve health . Systemic lupus erythematosus incurable chronic multi-organ inflammatory disease affect preferentially young woman . Unmet need include 15 % excess mortality , high morbidity poor work outcomes . Despite prevalence 1:2000 , lupus mostly unknown public access specialize care remain limited . Therefore , person lupus caregiver difficulty find high quality information relevant `` lupus journey '' . The LIN research team consist lupus clinical expert researcher , clinical psychologist behavioral researcher , health information specialist . This team , fund Canadian Institutes Health Research ( CIHR ) , responsible development LIN , web-based navigator design promote self-care . The LIN complete team work several stakeholder dissemination : Lupus Canada , Canadian Network Improved Outcomes Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ( CaNIOS ) , Arthritis Alliance Canada , lupus patient adviser . CaNIOS centre randomize immediate access LIN ( LIN_NOW group ) usual care crossover 3 month ( LIN_WAIT group ) . At baseline , patient meet entry criterion contact , ask complete online questionnaire . At three month , second online assessment perform cross centre randomize usual care order provide access LIN . A final assessment perform six month . Comparisons baseline versus LIN exposure three month perform patient end study ; comparison LIN use versus usual care do three month ; retention use six month LIN exposure document first group randomize LIN . The main outcome Patient Activation Measure , valid tool measure level patient engagement . Secondary outcome include variable describe access use LIN capture LIN server , cop , self-efficacy , global health status .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Self-management intervention essential meet challenge improve care person lupus must build sound person-centered approach aim self-empowerment . As , patient need equip technology provide relevant information support tool . The Lupus Interactive Navigator ( LIN ) develop target need person lupus . The LIN web-based program design provide relevant information support engagement self-management lupus . The LIN test 43 patient lupus yield high rating relevancy , credibility , usefulness information provide ready dissemination . An unblinded randomize cross-over study impact LIN perform . The study population restrict patient enrol lupus clinic affiliate Canadian Network Improved Outcomes Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ( CaNIOS ) . Centres randomized give access LIN baseline ( LIN_NOW ) allocate usual care crossover LIN 3 month wait period ( LIN_WAIT ) group . Following randomization , participate CaNIOS centre send recruitment letter adult ( 18 year old ) lupus patient . The letter explain nature national research project aim measure usefulness different support intervention lupus . Baseline : Patients willing participate give instruction access survey website provide consent questionnaire complete . follow completion baseline questionnaire , patient LIN_NOW group give access LIN . Patients LIN_WAIT group continue usual care three month . Three month : Email reminder send participant prior due date three month questionnaire . All email reminder include website link , instruction access user . The LIN-NOW group continue access LIN upon completion questionnaire . The LIN_WAIT group continue usual care three month cross LIN upon completion questionnaire . Six month : Email reminder send participant complete third set questionnaire prior due date . Both NOW WAIT group continue access LIN upon completion questionnaire . Measures : Questionnaires include assessment socio-demographic variable , patient activation , disease-related variable include self-reported disease activity damage , cop , self-efficacy , mood general health status . Four four main outcome measure relevant study , follow : The Patient Activation Measure PAM ) : The PAM 13-item measure level patient engagement health care . This tool design measure individual 's level confidence , belief , knowledge , skills manage one 's health . Respondents answer vary level agreement disagreement 4-point Likert-type scale . This scale show strong psychometric property . The PAM use observational intervention study patient-centered measure monitor change patient 's experience time , high score relate great self-management , healthy behavior , medication adherence , good clinical outcome high level satisfaction service . The Processes Care Survey - Short Form ( IPC-SF ) assess three domain patient interpersonal center care : communication , decision making , interpersonal style . The following scale IPC-SF use : communication scale ( lack clarity , elicit concerns/responded , explain result ) , patient-centered decision make scale , one interpersonal style scale ( compassionate/respectful ) . Higher score indicate report experience specific dimension , explanation instance decide together . The Lupus Self-efficacy Scale ( LSES ) measure patient ' confidence relate lupus-specific domain . This 11-items version ass level confidence manage decrease lupus-related symptom ( i.e . fatigue , mood ) . The construct concurrent validity scale demonstrate . Self-efficacy find important determinant understanding adoption self-management approach among patient arthritis . The Morisky Adherence Scale 4-item generic scale may apply medication disease measure particular time frame . Analysis . Descriptive statistic perform include description use LIN ( number visit , number page visit , number minute spend , etc ) . The first set analysis determine impact LIN PAM , primary outcome , entire population comparing score group follow 3 month exposure LIN ( difference score 3 month versus baseline LIN_NOW group pool score 6 month versus 3 month LIN-WAIT group ) . Secondary analysis use predictor variable , LIN , determine impact IPC-SF , LSES , Morisky scale , replace PAM outcome variable analysis . For outcome variable , analysis compare mean difference score PAM 3 month versus baseline . Multivariate analysis control demographic clinical variable age , sex , education , access internet , type device use , disease duration , lupus activity , lupus damage , physical mental health status , cop social support . The second set analysis question whether difference exposure LIN usual care compare patient centre randomize use LIN first three month versus centre randomize usual care period time . The third set analyse examine whether impact may observe three month group randomize LIN sustain six month compare outcome measure three six month LIN_NOW group .</detailed_description>
