	<brief_title>A Study Evaluating Safety Efficacy Rituximab Patients With Myasthenia Gravis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Myasthenia gravis ( MG ) autoimmune disease neuromuscular junction cause auto-antibodies . MG characterize weakness skeletal muscle occur age , mostly among young adult woman people sex age 60 year . The disease wide variation severity , milder case symptom-relieving choline esterase blocker may sufficient . In many case , however , immunomodulatory drug require . Traditionally MG treat high dos corticosteroid long time period , cause significant risk side effect . Therefore , since several decade , oral immunosuppressive drug use order reduce need steroid . This group include azathioprine , cyclosporine mycophenolate . However , none drug approve use MG effect usually delay . There thus great need develop new treatment algorithm MG , example include effective biological drug . Several small observational study show rituximab , anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody eliminate B cell , good effect treatment refractory MG . The aim present study study effect rituximab compare placebo treatment new onset MG moderate severe symptomatology .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients oculobulbar , bulbar generalize MG ≥ 18 year age onset generalize symptom neurophysiological detection generalize disease 12 month ago . 2 . The diagnosis MG determine follow : Clinical neurological status motor symptom consistent MG least two follow : positive serologic test antiacetylcholine receptor antibody ( AChR ) and/or b. typical MG finding neurophysiological test neuromuscular transmission single fiber electromyography ( SFEMG ) / repetitive nerve stimulation ( RNS ) , / c. Positive anticholine esterasetest , e.g . edrophoniumchloride improvement MG symptoms oral cholinesterase inhibitor judge treat physician . 3 . MGFA Class II IV screen . 4 . Quantitative MG score ≥ 6 screen 5 . Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test . 6 . Patients must provide write informed consent . 7 . Patients must able willing comply study procedure . 1 . Weakness affect ocular periocular muscle ( MGFA Class I ) . 2 . MG crisis screening ( MGFA Class V ) 3 . Thymectomy already carry . In order avoid difficulty evaluate effect study drug , thymectomy , indicate , schedule followup period , ie first 24 week . 4 . Strong suspicion thymoma , thymectomy judge treat physician do within 24 week . 5 . Active malignancy , adequately treat 6 . Pregnancy breastfeed . 7 . Ongoing acute chronic viral systemic bacterial infection include HIV , latent hepatitis B , clinically significant , accord study doctor 's opinion treat appropriate antibiotic / antiviral drug . 8 . Severe heart failure ( New York Heart Association Class IV ) severe , uncontrolled cardiac disease 9 . Previous use immunosuppressive drug , include rituximab , except prednisolone dose 40mg daily less 3 month . This apply treatment immunosuppressive drug / corticosteroid ( except rituximab ) indication MG , provide least 12 month pass since treatment terminate . 10 . Suspected hypersensitivity study drug 11 . Participation another trial study drug within 30 day prior screen . 12 . Any medical condition , accord study physician 's opinion , may interfere patient 's participation study , pose additional risk patient , complicate assessment patient . 13 . Vaccination within 4 week inclusion .</criteria>
