	<detailed_description>The overall goal improve outcome among patient atrial fibrillation ( AF ) prevent stroke . The investigator propose implement automate algorithm use electronic medical record ( EMR ) data alert physician large primary care practice network Massachusetts General Hospital ( MGH ) patient AF elevate stroke risk take anticoagulant stroke prevention . Using medical record algorithm , estimate 2,000 3,000 patient primary care practice MGH . The investigator hypothesize intervention notify physician individual may prompt reassessment need anticoagulation , thereby increase guideline-indicated anticoagulation rate . The investigator define follow three Specific Aims address primary study hypothesis : Specific Aim 1 : Implement automate alert system within EMR notify primary care physician ( PCPs ) patient AF elevate stroke risk treat anticoagulant . To maximize efficiency effort , alert require concurrent clinic visit , rather occur exist data aggregate medical record independent clinical encounter . Specific Aim 2 : Test whether alert system increase rate anticoagulation 3 month implementation . Specific Aim 3 : Characterize reason pursue anticoagulation AF patient elevate risk stroke . Specific Aim 4 : Assess PCPs want alert anticoagulation status future type support find helpful</detailed_description>
