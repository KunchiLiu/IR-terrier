	<brief_title>Study Ibrutinib Followed Ibrutinib Combination With Nivolumab Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : Each study cycle 28 day . If find eligible take part study , Cycle 1 , take ibrutinib alone . Ibrutinib take mouth 1 time day glass water . You take study drug time every day . You may take dose ibrutinib without food . If miss dose , take soon possible day return normal schedule follow day . You take extra dos follow day make forgotten dos . Beginning Cycle 2 , receive nivolumab vein 60 minute Days 1 15 every cycle . You continue take ibrutinib Cycle 1 . You give pill diary complete . You record diary dose medication take take . You bring diary study visit . Study Visits : On Day 1 ( +/- 7 day ) cycle : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . Between Days 21 28 Cycle 1 : - You tumor biopsy biomarker test check immune system 's response study drug . - Blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) draw cytokine/chemokine testing . On Day 28 Cycle 1 , CT neck chest check status disease . On Day 28 ( +/- 7 day ) Cycle 1 every 8 week : - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn check thyroid function . - You CT MRI scan check status disease . If become pregnant , may blood ( 1 teaspoon ) urine pregnancy test time doctor think need . Length Study : You may receive ibrutinib 2 year . You may receive nivolumab long study doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug ( ) disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study follow-up visit . Follow : Within 30 day last dose study drug : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn routine test . - If become pregnant , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) urine collect pregnancy test . Long-term follow : Every 6 month 2 year first dose study drug : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . This investigational study . Ibrutinib FDA approve commercially available treatment chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) mantle cell lymphoma ( MCL ) . It consider investigational use drug treat NSCLC . Nivolumab FDA approve commercially available treatment advance NSCLC . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 25 participant enrol study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
