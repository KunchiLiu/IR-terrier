	<detailed_description>I.8 Provide short summary purpose procedure study propose IRB application . - DO NOT include information study propose application . ( If source support proposal describe multiple aim , refer information button example complete question . ) - Use LAY terminology . This must easily understandable IRB community member nonscientists . - DO NOT cut paste technical abstract source support application may understand general audience . There accepted standard frequency monitor endotracheal tube cuff pressure ( ETCP ) . We plan compare two strategy monitor ETCP mechanically ventilate patient . The two strategy currently employ practice protocol outline Respiratory Therapy Protocol Barnes-Jewish Hospital ( BJH ) require ETCP assess immediately endotracheal tube place manipulation endotracheal tube include repositioning , manipulation cuff volume , presence audible leak . We compare current practice intensive monitoring ETCP employ hospital include element note current practice plus monitoring ETCP every work shift ( every 8 hour three time per day ) . The ETCP assess use standard manometer . The two practice compare patient assign odd even bed medical ICU ( 8400 ICU ) odd numbered patient current ETCP practice even room addition ETCP assessment every shift . It important note respiratory therapist carry ETCP assessment simply perform job therapist normal manner include assessment ETCPs . The respiratory therapists come work ICU carry job accord current protocol unit . ETCP assessment routine part job . They simply carry job accord protocol base room number patient . Assessing ETCPs take less 1-2 minute carry . The respiratory therapists work medical ICU carry job normal way . Respiratory therapy practice protocols frequently change course time . The therapist continue carry job routine manner medical ICU . I.9 Specify research question ( ) , study aim hypothesis ( indicate `` see protocol '' ) Our hypothesis increase monitoring frequency ETCP result reduction duration mechanical ventilation patient admit medical intensive care unit ( ICU ) BJH reduction ventilator-associated event . I.10 Background significance and/or Preliminary study relate project . ( indicate `` see protocol '' ) Currently accept gold standard frequency monitoring ETCP ( 1 ) . There widely different strategy report monitoring ETCP include continuous monitoring . The goal ETCP monitoring maintain ETCP 20-30 cmH2O order minimize cuff leak pressure injury tracheal mucosa . It know 20 30 % time ETCP may deviate threshold . However , impact deviation clinical outcome well described medical literature ( 2 ) . The two common method assess ETCP use manometer perform minimal leak , former accept method ( 3 ) . However , optimal frequency conduct manometric monitoring ETCP unknown . One recent study suggest act measure ETCP frequently order achieve desire pressure level result removal air cuff result inflation cuff ( 4 ) . However , recent animal study suggest material use manufacture endotracheal tube cuff may play important role determine presence absence mucosal injury , polyurethane well polyvinylchloride ( 5 ) . The main problem study failure assess clinical outcome bedside use various strategy maintain appropriate endotracheal tube cuff seal . A recent survey intensivists Queensland Australia accompany systematic literature review make follow conclusion regard ETCP monitor `` Twenty-eight twenty-nine respondent report routinely monitor tracheal cuff function , primarily employ cuff pressure measurement ( 26/28 ) . Target cuff pressure vary , 3/26 respondent aim 10 20 cmH2O , 10/26 21 25 cmH2O , 13/26 26 30 cmH2O . Fifteen twenty-nine report current guideline protocol tracheal cuff management 16/29 indicate dedicated area clinical record reporting cuff intervention . Our result indicate many ICUs across Queensland routinely measure tracheal cuff function , utilising pressure monitoring device . Consistent exist literature , optimum cuff pressure remain uncertain . Most , however , consider routine part ICU care '' ( 6 ) . Thus , available literature ETCP relationship clinical outcome lack .</detailed_description>
