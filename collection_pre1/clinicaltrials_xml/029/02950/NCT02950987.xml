	<brief_title>Screening With Whole Body MRI For Detection Of Primary Tumors In Children And Adults With Li-Fraumeni Syndrome ( LFS ) And Other Cancer Predisposition Syndromes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Individuals carry TP53 mutation high risk develop different type cancer lifetimes . This gene associate Li Fraumeni syndrome family , family cancer history consistent Li Fraumeni syndrome mutation . Currently , standard method monitoring LFS carrier , family member , others individual cancer predisposition syndrome detect cancer early stage , may easily treat . The main aim study test relatively new medical technology call Whole Body Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) , patient syndrome , see cancer detect early stage may , turn , allow effective treatment . The investigator choose Whole Body MRI scan scan allows doctor look entire body one examination . By use technology , participant expose radiation , particular importance individual higher cancer risk due diagnosis LFS .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adults Individuals great equal 18 year age . Individuals `` Li Fraumeni Syndrome '' define one following : Carriers germline p53 mutation Members family meet classic LFS criterion family history without identifiable p53 mutation Obligate carrier pedigree ( individual offer test still eligible defer ) . The following example describe `` obligate carrier pedigree . '' A child parent know p53 mutation diagnose cancer An individual sibling child p53 positive OR Individuals inherit cancer predisposition syndrome define one following : Hereditary Retinoblastoma germline Rb mutation Diagnosis Hereditary Paraganglioma/Pheochromocytoma Syndrome germline SDH mutation Diagnosis Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia , Type 1 2 , germline MEN mutation New diagnosis opsoclonusmyoclonus negative cancer workup upon presentation symptom Familial Neuroblastoma germline ALK mutation Rapidonset Obesity Hypothalamic dysfunction , Hypoventilation Autonomic Dysregulation ( ROHHAD syndrome ) Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome ( CCHS ) without germline PHOX 2B mutation Von HippelLindau VHL mutation Women abnormal cellfree DNA test ( i.e . noninvasive prenatal test ( NIPT ) detect chromosomal abnormality ) cancer diagnosis Other rare cancer predisposition syndromes discretion treat physician study physician NOTE : Individuals abovelisted cancer predisposition syndrome ( apart Li Fraumeni syndrome ) likewise eligible absence know mutation obligate carrier pedigree . Individuals prior history cancer ; individual must stable remission least 6 month completion surgery/radiation\ therapy/chemotherapy . Individual case review institutional principal investigator .
