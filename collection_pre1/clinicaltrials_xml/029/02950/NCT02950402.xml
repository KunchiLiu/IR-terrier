	<brief_title>Dried Plums Chronic Disease Markers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The age U.S. population present number challenge , many address nutritional approach . Postmenopausal woman particularly at-risk number disease osteoporosis ( By 2020 estimate 50 percent woman 50 year old either suffer at-risk bone loss ) , cardiovascular disease , number one killer postmenopausal woman . Polyphenolic compound fruit nut focus extensive research regard potential reduce risk number chronic disease . All fruit create equally , determine dry plum ( Prunus domestica L. ) certain phytochemical amount promote health consume realistic amount important . This demonstration likely impact market demand dry plum . Indeed , favorable research California specialty crop ( walnut , almond , strawberry , grape ) key strategy help grower increase sale . While hundred plum cultivar exist , vary amount phenolic compound , process dry result high amount hydroxycinnamic acid , family compound show , animal model , protective bone health reduce bone loss improve bone growth . Hydroxycinnamic acid also propose improve vascular function protect smooth endothelial lining blood vessel animal model . Whether encourage observation also occur human unknown . Therefore , overall objective project conduct first human study explore effect California dry plum marker bone health vascular function . Favorable result project increase awareness unique benefit dry plum bone health vascular health , two topic great interest age baby boomer health-conscious consumer , U.S. internationally .</detailed_description>
