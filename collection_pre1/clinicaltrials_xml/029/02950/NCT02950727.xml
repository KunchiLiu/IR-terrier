	<brief_summary>In current study comparison 3 positional screw versus adjustable plat system conjunction 2 positional screw . The patient select retrognathic mandible require advancement . Hypothetically advantage adjustable plating system compare three positional screw . In theory , investigator use inherent advantage intraoperative flexibility adjustable plating system verify position proximal segment ( condylar segment ) , hence eliminate immediate postoperative relapse report use three positional screw . This evaluate clinically cephalometrically .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Trauner Obwegeser 1957 , report first correction jaw deformity sagittal split technique . Dal Pont 1961 , student Obwegeser , make modification latter technique , enhance precision accuracy movement proximal distal segment technique become widely publicize . He change low horizontal cut vertical cut buccal cortex first second molar , obtain broad bony contact . Hunsuck 1968 , modify technique , decrease soft tissue dissection ; advocate short horizontal medial cut . Epker 1977 , modify technique several way decrease swelling , manipulation neurovascular bundle hemorrhage , modification include minimal strip masseter muscle medial dissection . BSSRO common procedure use advance mandible bilateral sagittal split osteotomy . There many different method mandibular fixation use intra osseous wiring combine inter maxillary fixation ( IMF ) show significant amount relapse patient dissatisfaction , call nonrigid fixation . Another type mandibular fixation three point fixation use position screw call rigid fixation . Rigid internal fixation introduce 1976 Spiessel promote healing , restore early function , decrease relapse . The introduction internal rigid fixation method , instead 5-6 week intermaxillary fixation , add benefit shorter period hospital stay patient convenience . ' Minimal immobilization jaw allow patient function sooner , resume daily activity , return work earlier . In relatively short period time , use rigid fixation bony segment orthognathic surgery become standard care . A major concern surgical correction anteroposterior mandibular deficient patient potential postsurgical relapse . Clinical study show wide array successful technique use fix segment . Three bicortical screw place inverted-L fashion become gold standard stabilize bilateral sagittal split advancement . Various problem emerge , however , show stability necessary stabilization osteotomy site directly compare fracture . Other problem encounter difficulty position fragment new site , result malposition condyle . This led term 'immediate postoperative relapse ' . In addition , pain dysfunction temporomandibular joint ( TMJ ) complicate treatment make target long-term stability difficult achieve . In current study comparison 3 positional screw comparison adjustable plate conjunction 2 positional screw use group patient suffer retrognathia treat BSSRO , thus investigator use advantage inherent adjustability plate intraoperatively good fixation stability inherent bicortical screw short term stability . This evaluate clinically cephalometrically .</detailed_description>
