	<brief_summary>The primary aim study therefore investigate effect pain disability emphasize exercise program target deep neck extensor semispinalis cervicis general exercise program neck extensor muscle patient chronic neck pain . As secondary aim , effect exercise program activation pattern two neck extensor muscle investigate electromyography ( EMG ) . The investigator hypothesize exercise program would similar effect pain alleviation pain related disability , emphasized exercise program deep semispinalis cervicis would improve activation compare general exercise program . The result study relevant design effective rehabilitation/training program patient chronic neck pain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Therapeutic Exercise Activation Neck Extensors People With Chronic Neck Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An independent group , repeated-measures study design adopt investigate immediate effect two different kind intervention : Emphasized exercise target deep cervical extensor general exercise target neck extensor . Subjects randomize two exercise group : emphasize exercise group patient perform muscle contraction resistance directly neck general exercise group resistance apply head . Sealed opaque envelope use conceal allocation . Exercise regimes 6-weeks duration start within one week initial assessment . All subject receive personal instruction supervision one experienced physiotherapist , week , duration whole program . Subjects receive exercise diary request practice respective regime twice per day six-week duration trial , without provoke neck pain attention correct performance exercise . Exercises home occur period longer 15 20 minute twice per day . Subjects ask seek intervention neck pain duration study , although usual medication withheld . All patient perform two static exercise one dynamic exercise . The difference group location resistance , low cervical spine approximately level C4 emphasize exercise group occiput general exercise group . 1 . Patients emphasized exercise group perform exercise emphasize deep cervical extensor muscle apply resistance level vertebral arch C4 either therapeutically therapist 's finger home exercise aid towel belt . These exercise perform sit stand front table prop forearm . In latter position , dynamic exercise add move head maximal flexion maximal extension keep gaze fix object lie elbow hop activate extensor low cervical spine . 2 . Patients general exercise group perform exercise target cervical extensor muscle include superficial one apply resistance head push wall therapist 's hand home exercise aid towel . As group , exercise perform sit stand front table prop forearm . In latter position , dynamic exercise add group difference gaze fix object lie hand hop activate cervical extensor . The dosage exercise regime require maximal muscle activation patient show dosage emphasize exercise result muscle activation 20 % 25 % MVC ( Maximum Voluntary Contraction ) general exercise 50 % MVC ( Schomacher et al. , 2015 ) . Patients ask therefore perform exercise individual maximal force short time without provoke pain neither exercise . That , submaximal effort without evoke pain exercise use . All exercise repeat 3 set break 1-2 minute set . The two static exercise consist 6 repetition 6 second hold position 6 second rest contraction . The dynamic exercise perform 6 repetition whole range motion 2-3 second repetition without rest repetition . A break repetition add necessary avoid pain ( Table 1 ) . Patients repeat exercise session one time per week supervision physiotherapist , 6 week . In addition , patient perform exercise session twice per day seven day per week home . Each exercise session last 20 - 25 minute .</detailed_description>
