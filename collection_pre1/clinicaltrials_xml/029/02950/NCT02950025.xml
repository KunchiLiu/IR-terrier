	<brief_summary>In light new technology preliminary finding low toxicity online , adaptive , magnetic resonance ( M ) -guided stereotactic radiation single arm prospective study , investigator propose compare technique online MR-guided stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) without adaptation . Online plan adaptation increase treatment time patient comprises increase burden technical clinical staff . Although preliminary trial result encouraging , remain unclear dosimetric benefit online-adaptive planning study translate measurable improvement clinical outcome merit routine use . In preliminary study , plan adaptation often required tumor adjacent gastrointestinal tract ( esophagus sigmoid colon ) , structure commonly dose-limiting structure note change location day-to-day basis . For reason , abdominal disease sit historically highlight limitation SBRT . Specifically , investigator enroll patient oligometastatic unresectable primary disease non-liver abdomen randomize , prospective trial . Patients randomize one two treatment arm , receive either online-adaptive , MRI-guided SBRT non-adaptive MRI-guided SBRT . Both patient group undergo MRI simulation MRI treatment localization online MR monitoring and/or gate . All patient treat five fraction one two week . By adhere strict normal tissue constraint , investigator expect toxicity within current standard care non-adaptive arm , reduction toxicity arm patient undergo adaptation base daily anatomic change .</brief_summary>
