	<brief_summary>Current dose escalation regimen without chemotherapy fail achieve improve local control overall survival standard care therapy date . Difficulties dose escalation largely due dose limit toxicity surround normal organ , particular normal lung parenchyma , esophagus . Real time , online adaptive planning use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) could achieve significant volume reduction primary lung disease course therapy , thereby reduce dose normal structure , provide mechanism dose escalate safely , effectively accurate target delineation . The investigator hypothesize MRI base adaptive planning provide novel method dose escalate safely acceptable organ risk dos . In addition , improvement radiotherapy target accuracy , normal tissue avoidance , conformality target-tissue coverage achieve use 4D real-time track derive deformably register daily MR planning MR ( MRsim ) Computed Tomography Simulator ( CTsim ) advance non-rigid image-registration tool .</brief_summary>
