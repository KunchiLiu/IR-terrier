	<brief_summary>The aim study evaluate standard chemoimmunotherapy ( FCR , BR ) frontline treatment physically fit CLL patient without del17p TP 53 mutation replace combination target drug ( Venetoclax , Ibrutinib ) anti-CD20-antibodies ( Rituximab , Obinutuzumab ) , may induce extremely long lasting remission .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Standard Chemoimmunotherapy ( FCR/BR ) Versus Rituximab + Venetoclax ( RVe ) Versus Obinutuzumab ( GA101 ) + Venetoclax ( GVe ) Versus Obinutuzumab + Ibrutinib + Venetoclax ( GIVe ) Fit Patients With Previously Untreated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( CLL ) Without Del ( 17p ) TP53 Mutation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chemoimmunotherapy standard care first-line treatment CLL patient without del17p TP 53 mutation ; physically fit patient treated fludarabine , cyclophosphamide rituximab ( FCR ) 1 . Due high risk severe neutropenias infection FCR , bendamustine rituximab ( BR ) must consider patient age &gt; 65 year . However , conventional chemoimmunotherapies associate side effect cause rather unspecific mode action chemotherapy . Therefore , urgent need alternative , especially chemotherapy-free regimen . In first line treatment elderly patient CLL coexist condition , anti-CD20-antibody obinutuzumab new standard therapy . In CLL11 trial combination obinutuzumab chlorambucil prove safe lead markedly improve response rate well PFS time comparison chlorambucil alone combine rituximab . The BCL2 antagonist venetoclax ( GDC-0199/ABT-199 ) show striking activity tumor lysis syndrome dose limit toxicity patient relapse refractory CLL . 400 mg venetoclax determine safe efficacious dose . Several patient treat combination venetoclax rituximab relapse refractory CLL even achieve MRD negativity . The FDA approve Venetoclax treatment relapse CLL 17p/TP53 12th April 2016 . Therefore , venetoclax plus CD20-antibody base combination potential induce high rate MRD negativity frontline therapy CLL concomitantly induce low rate toxicity chemotherapy might replace . Furthermore , venetoclax obinutuzumab demonstrate synergistic activity preclinical study murine Non-Hodgkin lymphoma xenograft model , additive activity CLL lymph node model . The combination appear tolerable firstline treatment CLL patient coexist condition whilst toxicity profile drug compare favorably chemotherapy currently use treatment CLL . Consequently , test rituximab replace obinutuzumab combination venetoclax trial . Ibrutinib , selective , irreversible small molecular inhibitor Bruton´s Tyrosine Kinase ( BTK ) , show excellent response safe toxicity profile9,10 , even combination BR . Ibrutinib approve treatment relapse CLL well frontline therapy CLL FDA EMA ( April 29th 2016 ) . The combination ibrutinib venetoclax show synergy primary CLL cell . Consequently , aim current trial evaluate chemoimmunotherapy frontline treatment physically fit patient CLL replace combination target drug anti-CD20-antibodies .</detailed_description>
