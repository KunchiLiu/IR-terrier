	<detailed_description>Several observational study show cystic fibrosis ( CF ) patient less equal 6 year age clinically silent airway damage . There grow interest early initiation therapy prevent delay progression lung disease CF . In SHIP-CT , investigator evaluate treatment effect HS relative IS measure structural lung disease obtain chest CT use novel score system sensitive early lung change , Perth-Rotterdam Annotated Grid Morphometric Analysis method CF ( PRAGMA-CF ) , quantify volume percentage diseased airway ( % Dis ) , bronchiectasis ( % Bx ) , trap air ( % TA ) . As secondary evaluation structural airway damage , investigator use image analysis system measure airway dimension relative adjacent artery ( AA-system ) . Longitudinal change CT measure also compare change lung function measure lung clearance index ( LCI ) obtain N2 Multiple Breath Washout ( MBW ) clinical outcome . The primary hypothesis HS reduce structural lung disease assess PRAGMA-CF compute tomography score relative IS 48-week treatment period among preschool child CF . SHIP-CT parallel study SHIP001 ( ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT02378467 ) . The primary hypothesis SHIP001 , run North America , compare IS , HS improve LCI , measure ventilation heterogeneity , 48-week treatment period among preschool child CF . The SHIP-CT study ( SHIP002 ) use nearly identical study design SHIP001 study , similar eligibility criterion treatment arm , determine whether HS reduce structural lung disease measure chest compute tomography ( CT ) , addition stabilize improve functional outcome measure LCI . This multicenter , randomize , double-blind , control , parallel group trial assess structural lung disease child CF age 3 5 enrollment . Participants randomize 1:1 receive 7 % hypertonic saline ( treatment arm ) vs. 0.9 % isotonic saline ( control arm ) administer twice daily via jet nebulizer 48 week . Study visit occur screen , enrollment , Weeks 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 . Parents legal guardian contact Weeks 1 , 4 8 document change health status , adverse event , concomitant medications/treatments , encourage study treatment compliance . Parents legal guardian also contact approximately every 6 week visit 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 address individual issue concern related study treatment study participation , document change health status , medication treatment . Total duration participant participation 53 week . As enrollment occur approximately 18 month , total duration study expect 30 month ( 18 month enrollment plus 12 month last participant complete study participation ) .</detailed_description>

Age ≥ 36 month ≤72 month screen visit 4 . Ability comply medication use , study visit study procedure judge site investigator 5 . Ability cooperate chest CT enrollment visit determine lung function technician 1 . Chest CT within 8 month prior Screening visit 2 . Acute intercurrent respiratory infection , define increase cough , wheeze , respiratory rate onset within 3 week precede screen enrollment visit 3 . Acute wheeze screen enrollment visit 4 . Oxygen saturation &lt; 95 % ( &lt; 90 % center locate 4000 foot elevation ) screen enrollment visit 5 . Other major organ dysfunction , exclude pancreatic dysfunction 6 . Physical finding would compromise safety participant quality study data determine site investigator 7 . Investigational drug use within 30 day prior screen enrollment visit 8 . Treatment inhale HS concentration within 30 day prior screen enrollment visit 9 . Initiation ( i.e . new prescription ) inhale hydrate agent mannitol mucolytic agent dornase alpha within 30 day prior screen enrollment visit 10 . Chronic lung disease relate CF 11 . Inability tolerate first dose study treatment enrollment visit</criteria>
