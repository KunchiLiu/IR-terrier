	<brief_summary>Lung cancer lead cause cancer death men woman United States . In 2014 , estimate 224,210 men woman diagnose carcinoma lung bronchus , result 159,260 death . Per current National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( NCCN ) guideline , standard care early-stage non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) lobectomy lymph node dissection . Historically , medically inoperable early-stage NSCLC patient offer definitive external beam radiotherapy ( EBRT ) primary management , overall , study consistently show poor patient outcome . Stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) technique delivers high dos radiation per fraction one five fraction precisely define volume steep dose gradient . SBRT commonly utilize treatment biopsy-proven early stage NSCLC medically inoperable patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy Un-biopsied Early- Stage Non Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This purpose study learn good bad effect treat early stage lung cancer without biopsy tumor . Participants research receive type radiation treatment call Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy ( SBRT ) . This type radiation target directly tumor damage surround normal tissue avoid . SBRT often use treat patient biopsy proven early stage lung cancer surgery medical reason . In study , SBRT consider experimental tumor biopsied . SBRT early-stage NSCLC consistently proven provide excellent local control improve overall survival medically inoperable patient . The constancy find variety dose schedule confirm robustness SBRT . This study utilize 54 Gy 3 fraction deliver twice weekly peripheral lesion . In order respect increase risk adverse event dose centrally locate lesion reduce 50 Gy 5 fraction deliver twice weekly chest wall rib adjacent lesion 60 Gy 5 fraction . These dos consistent Radiation Therapy Oncology Group ( RTOG ) 0236 peripheral lesion RTOG 0813 central lesion ≥100 Gy Biological Effective Dose ( BED ) previously discuss . The investigator study routinely prescribe 60 Gy 5 fraction rib adjacent lesion . The primary objective ass acute chronic toxicity associate SBRT unbiopsied early-stage NSCLC . Secondary objective include : To evaluate disease specific outcomes local control , lobar failure-free survival , regional/nodal failure-free survival , distant metastasis-free survival , disease-free survival , cause-specific survival , overall survival associate SBRT unbiopsied early-stage NSCLC patient . To evaluate Pulmonary Function Test ( PFT ) change time follow SBRT unbiopsied early-stage NSCLC patient . To evaluate patient 's overall quality life treatment SBRT unbiopsied early-stage NSCLC patient .</detailed_description>
