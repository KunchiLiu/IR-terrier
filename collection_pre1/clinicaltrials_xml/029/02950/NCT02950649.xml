	<brief_title>Evaluation Clinical Impact Non-Invasive Hemodynamic Monitoring Optimize Perioperative Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study seek evaluate impact use non-invasive technology ass flow guide parameter ( SV , SVR , dp/dt , CO , etc . ) patient care decision preoperative setting . Patients see preoperative clinic undergo moderate high-risk procedure less 4 metabolic equivalent ( METs ) approach participate study . Once consent , device place preoperative clinic visit data present care team . Surveys complete health care provider consent patient determine data device positively impact patient care decision . Specifically , survey evaluate provide information patient 's cardiovascular function ( via device use study ) facilitate health care provider identify patient reduce cardiovascular function . For primary outcome , study evaluate device assistant identification patient reduce cardiovascular function provide flow guide parameter list . Secondary marker include evaluation perioperative complication rate ( composite outcome ) non-invasive HD data display preoperative team vs. . Additional secondary maker include : frequency intraoperative hemodynamic optimization goal direct fluid therapy administration , health care provider survey result , patient survey level discomfort wear cuff study . length hospital stay , length intensive care stay , readmission hospital within 30 day hospital discharge , 30-day postoperative mortality . Outcome data collect use electronic medical record database available investigator institution . It hope investigator study demonstrate simply apply preoperative use non-invasive hemodynamic technology one : 1. appropriately identify patient would benefit intraoperative hemodynamic monitoring strategy 2. increase satisfaction preoperative assessment health care provider 3. validate importance care patient knowledge volume status , contractility , vascular resistance patient care setting .</detailed_description>
