	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate whether tDCS enhances effect cognitive remediation therapy cognition functional outcome patient epilepsy . There evidence work memory performance enhance healthy subject . Acute tDCS study find improvement work memory performance subject neurological disease . To date , publish study examine whether enhance learn multi-session cognitive remediation 2 week subject epilepsy . This study could potential application non-invasive clinical intervention interictal dysfunction epilepsy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Epilepsy chronic neurological disorder affect 50 million people worldwide . Patients suffer recur seizure , also cognitive deficit despite adequate treatment control . Cognitive remediation therapy ( CRT ) therapeutic intervention recently show promise improve cognitive impairment many neuropsychological disorder . Transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) non-invasive method modulate cortical excitability . It work apply weak electrical current scalp induce acute modification neuronal membrane potential , produce long-lasting change bioelectric activity underlie brain tissue . It postulate tDCS enhances benefit gain cognitive remediation therapy . These intervention yet combine treatment interictal dysfunction patient epilepsy . The goal study investigate whether introduction tDCS addition CRT effective treatment cognitive impairment patient suffer epilepsy .</detailed_description>
