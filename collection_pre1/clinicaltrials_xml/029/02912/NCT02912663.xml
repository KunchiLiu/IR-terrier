	<brief_summary>This phase 1 , blinded-outcome , randomize , placebo control study investigate safety feasibility super-selective intra-arterial administration verapamil magnesium sulfate immediately follow successful endovascular thrombectomy potential neuroprotective synergistic therapeutic strategy emergent large vessel occlusion stroke . This trial represent first time magnesium sulfate evaluate human subject superselectively administer neuroprotective agent administer acute time frame adjunct intra-arterial thrombectomy . Furthermore , represent first trial evaluate combinational therapy acute stroke neuroprotection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants recruit patient evaluate University Kentucky Chandler Hospital acute ischemic stroke . Participants impaired capacity may include , pathology study ( stroke ) may impair capacity . Initial contact make sub-investigators approve obtain consent ; sub-investigators practitioner would make contact potential participant clinical manner standard clinical procedure . All sub-investigators access stroke patient ' medical information normal circumstance . No special outreach necessary recruit particular population . Enrollment goal 15 patient group . Participants compensate provided incentive study participation . The following describes study procedure evaluation do part study . Visit 1-Baseline ( Day 0 ) : - Obtain consent . - Medical history take medical record , participant family determine eligibility base inclusion/exclusion criterion ( Standard Care ) - Medication history ( Standard Care ) - Physical examination include vital sign ( Standard Care ) - Pregnancy Testing ( Standard Care ) - NIH Stroke Scale ( Standard Care ) - Verify inclusion/exclusion criterion - Randomization - Cerebral angiogram Endovascular Thrombectomy ( Standard Care ) - Study Drug administration - Adverse event ( AE ) collection Immediately follow thrombectomy study procedure participant transfer Neuro-Intenstive care Unit ( ICU ) similar ICU least 24 hour monitor care . Vital sign neurological assessment assess every hour . Evaluations groin access site perform every every 15 minute first hour , 30 minute second hour , finally every hour next 4 hour . Thereafter , groin site perform every shift . Visit 2 - Within 48 hour admission â€¢ Non-contrast Postoperative MRI CT ( Standard Care ) The choice one determine clinical criterion ; CT MRI may preferable different reason depend upon patient 's clinical scenario . Visit 3 - ( By Discharge ) - NIH Stroke Scale ( Standard Care ) - Discharge Destination ( Standard Care ) - Cognitive Assessment ( Standard Care ) - Radiographic assessment primary secondary radiologic endpoint Visit 4 - End Study ( 90 Days ) ( +/- 30 day ) - UBACC assessment use assess consent capacity follow-up . - Montreal Cognitive Assessment ( MoCA ) - Modified Rankin Score ( mRS ; Standard Care ) The visit may conduct phone participant legally authorize representative . Unscheduled Visits . It unexpected Unscheduled Visits common , especially follow-up within 90 day procedure . However , subject readmitted hospital reason track determine AE occur . Prohibited Medications , Treatments Procedures : Participants therapeutic anticoagulation exclude study . If medically necessary underlying condition , therapeutic anticoagulation may start 72 hour study drug administration . Participants use disopyramide within 48 hour 24 hour verapamil intravenous beta-block . Following successful completion baseline visit , participant randomize study . The randomization number assign PI/neurointerventionalist . Participants randomize receive 10mg verapamil 10 cc normal saline 1000mg magnesium sulfate 20cc normal saline match placebo .</detailed_description>
