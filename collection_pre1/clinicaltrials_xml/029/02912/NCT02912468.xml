	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : To evaluate efficacy dupilumab compare placebo background mometasone furoate nasal spray ( MFNS ) reduce nasal congestion/obstruction ( NC ) severity endoscopic nasal polyp score ( NPS ) patient bilateral nasal polyposis ( NP ) . In addition Japan , reduction compute tomography ( CT ) scan opacification sinus also co-primary objective . Secondary Objectives : - To evaluate efficacy dupilumab improve total symptom score ( TSS ) . - To evaluate efficacy dupilumab improve sense smell . - To evaluate efficacy dupilumab reduce CT scan opacification sinus ( Primary objective Japan ) . - To evaluate ability dupilumab reduce proportion patient require treatment oral corticosteroid NP surgery . - To evaluate effect dupilumab patient report outcome health relate quality life outcome sinonasal outcome test-22 ( SNOT-22 ) . - To evaluate effect dupilumab subgroup patient prior surgery co-morbid asthma ( include non-steroid antiinflammatory drug [ NSAID ] exacerbate respiratory disease [ NERD ] ) . - To evaluate residual effect follow . - To evaluate safety dupilumab patient bilateral NP . - To evaluate functional dupilumab concentration ( systemic exposure ) incidence treatment-emergent anti-drug antibody ( ADA ) .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion : Patients bilateral sinonasal polyposis despite prior treatment systemic corticosteroid ( SCS ) anytime within past 2 year ; and/or medical contraindication / intolerance SCS , and/or prior surgery NP screen visit , : An endoscopic bilateral NPS least 5 maximum score 8 ( minimum score 2 nasal cavity ) . Ongoing symptom ( least 8 week prior V1 ) nasal congestion/blockage/obstruction moderate severe symptom severity ( score 2 3 ) V1 weekly average severity great 1 time randomization ( V2 ) , another symptom loss smell , rhinorrhea ( anterior/posterior ) . Signed write informed consent . Exclusion criterion : Patients &lt; 18 year age . Patient previously treat dupilumab study . Patient take : Biologic therapy/systemic immunosuppressant treat inflammatory disease autoimmune disease ( eg , rheumatoid arthritis , inflammatory bowel disease , primary biliary cirrhosis , systemic lupus erythematosus , multiple sclerosis , etc . ) within 2 month V1 5 halflives , whichever longer . Any experimental monoclonal antibody ( mAB ) within 5 halflives within 6 month V1 halflife unknown . Antiimmunoglobulin E ( IgE ) therapy ( omalizumab ) within 130 day prior V1 . Leukotriene antagonists/modifiers unless patient continuous treatment least 30 day prior V1 . Initiation allergen immunotherapy within 3 month prior V1 plan begin therapy change dose runin period randomize treatment period . Patients undergone intranasal and/or sinus surgery ( include polypectomy ) within 6 month prior V1 . Patients sinonasal sinus surgery change lateral wall structure nose make impossible evaluation NPS . Patients conditions/concomitant disease make nonevaluable V1 primary efficacy endpoint : Antrochoanal polyp . Nasal septal deviation would occlude least one nostril . Acute sinusitis , nasal infection upper respiratory infection . Ongoing rhinitis medicamentosa .
