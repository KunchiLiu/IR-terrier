	<brief_title>Pocket Warming Epidural Medication</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Studies show warmed epidural medication result mean analgesic onset 9.2 minute compare mean onset 16 minute medication room temperature . Onset time pain medication labor important great many participant , thus technique shorten analgesic onset relevant daily clinical practice . Combined-spinal epidural ( CSE ) technique use improve onset reliability labor analgesia compare epidural technique ; however , CSEs risk associated usage . Firstly , always possible administer spinal dose despite successful loss-of resistance CSE technique , provide less satisfactory labor analgesia , secondly , CSE technique associate great incidence non-reassuring fetal heart tone ( FHT ) , uterine hyperactivity , maternal pruritis , great incidence neurologic sequela compare epidural analgesia . Further , CSE labor analgesia likely result prolong FHT deceleration FHT abnormality prior neuraxial procedure . Given potential limitation CSE technique labor analgesia , epidural medication warming may represent effective alternative safe satisfactory labor analgesia . Previous study obstetric non-obstetric patient undergo surgery demonstrate rapid onset sensory blockade patient receive body temperature ( 37 °C ) epidural medication compare room temperature medication , though report find significant difference onset sensory blockade compare body temperature room temperature epidural medication . To knowledge investigator , study examine effect warm epidural medication patient receive epidural labor analgesia . In experience investigator ' colleague , close proximity body warm effect epidural medication ultimately lead quicker onset pain relief administer . Pocket warm warm medication extent incubator , certainly less expensive readily available every obstetric anesthesia practice . The investigator previously measure temperature five 10mL syrinx normal saline room temperature baseline average 21.7 °C ( range 21.5-21.9 °C ) , increased average 29.7 °C ( range 29.1 - 30.2 °C ) 1.5 hour pocket warm . It study unknown degree warm would effective enhance onset labor analgesia , information valuable give approximate 30 °C temperature may accomplish simple pocket warm within manufacturer recommend storage temperature 15-30 °C . The investigator also assess potential epidural medication cool measure temperature one investigator 's 10mL saline syrinx twenty minute removal warm pocket environment . The initial temperature 30.0 °C cool 27.0 °C five minute , 24.7 °C ten minute , 22.9 °C fifteen minute , return baseline room temperature twenty minute . The time medication removal dose important consider give significant cooling may occur negate potential benefit warm medication . This cool effect make use centralized warmer less promising , could take 10-20 minute position patient complete placement epidural catheter prior dose medication . The use bedside incubator pocket warm technique would useful regard , medication could administer immediately removal warm environment . The investigator hypothesize pocket warm front , upper pocket would beneficial enhance onset labor analgesia relative room temperature medication .</detailed_description>
