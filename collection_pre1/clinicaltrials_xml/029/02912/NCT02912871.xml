	<brief_title>Subthalamotomy ExAblate Transcranial System Treat Motor Features Parkinson 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This ExAblate Transcranial system build atop ExAblate Body system technology , receive EMA CE approval treatment uterine fibroid bone metastasis palliation , currently evaluate various EMA Investigational Device Exemptions `` IDE '' . It note ExAblate Transcranial/Neuro receive CE approval ( Dec-2012 ) . There many potential advantage apply ExAblate Transcranial subthalamotomy treatment idiopathic PD : - The procedure transcranial , require incision , burr hole , electrode . The risk hemorrhagic complication reduce , procedure eliminate risk infectious complication . - Unlike stereotactic radiosurgery , ExAblate Transcranial system use ionize radiation carry risk radiation-induced tumorigenesis . The effect immediate latent radiosurgery . - Unlike radiofrequency ablation , ExAblate Transcranial system thermal lesioning perform without open surgery . - The ExAblate treatment monitor real-time MRI MR-thermal feedback permit immediate confirmation target process . Additionally , treatment monitor clinical testing . - Unlike DBS treatment , implant hardware , concern interference external source electromagnetic noise , need extensive follow-up programming , need periodic battery replacement . ExAblate Transcranial treatment may represent simpler treatment algorithm patient suffer complicated disease process like PD . Hours clinic time save DBS device management replacement health care cost may greatly reduce . - Rational ExAblate Transcranial System subthalamotomy Treatment PD Conceptually , lesioning subthalamus seem logical since preclinical study confirm role subthalamic nucleus development parkinsonism fact experimental Parkinsonian state MPTP relieve exocytotic thermolytic lesion STN . Furthermore , clinical study deep brain stimulation target subthalamic nucleus proven nucleus effective treatment advance Parkinson 's disease . From clinical perspective , unilateral subthalamotomy medication-refractory Parkinson 's disease certainly proven beneficial alleviation contralateral off-medication motor symptoms several series . The large best report experience come CIREN ( La Habana , Cuba ) project initiate direct Prof. Jose Obeso 10 year period lead large accumulated experience . This describe 89 patient follow 36 month . In report , significant improvement note UPDRS rating bradykinesia , rigidity tremor . Improvements remain two year pronounce tremor . With regard `` '' state , contralateral dyskinesia reduce two-year study mean dose Levodopa decrease 34-47 % total time without dyskinesia increase fourfold . In study significant reduction part three off-medication UPDRS note 12 ( 50 % ) , 24 ( 30 % ) , 36 month ( 18 % ) follow unilateral subthalamotomy . In `` '' state , contralateral dyskinesia improve throughout 3-year study period although ipsilateral dyskinesia progressively worsen time . In limited number patient bilateral stag ( N-7 ) simultaneous ( N-11 ) subthalamotomy carry without major adverse effect highly significant motor improvement . Cognitive change specifically ascertain prospectively without evidence deterioration . More recently , impact unilateral subthalamotomy inhibitory mechanism also report study group . Unexpectedly , speed stop initiate action improve STN lesion . Subthalamotomy never widely accept concern hemiballismus primarily due observation human stroke region subthalamus ( Purdon Martin 1927 ) confirmation 1940 's Whittier Mettler able experimentally reproduce subthalamic lesion primate . Arguments dogma amply discussed year ago lead understand parkinsonian state modifies threshold hemiballism STN lesion . The ExAblate modality permit precise focused lesion create without disruption motor pathway nuclei . In order test feasibility use ExAblate Neuro system ablation subthalamic nucleus two patient ( University Virginia ) active-sham treat use sublethal dose energy ( 50-54⁰C ) . The subject observe 30 day without develop adverse effect like worsen involuntary movement . Since adverse effect worsen involuntary movement , actual second stage treatment perform . Again , adverse effect worsen involuntary movement observe . The safety profile remain favorable . Interestingly , rationale choose target temperature 50-54⁰C ' subtherapeutic/test ' lesion base experience acquire feasibility study Essential Tremor IDE # G10016969 preclinical lesioning swine model . In 15 patient ET , typical onset neurologic phenomenon ( ie sensory symptom ) tremor suppression observe peak voxel temperature MR thermography reach low 50 's ⁰C . It observe tremor effect first occurs titrate lesioning process transient suppression postural rest tremor . Later high temperature 55-65⁰C , tremor effect become last . Also T2 signal change MRI typically visible acutely human thalamus peak voxel temperature approach 55-65⁰C range . These high temperature result thalamotomy volume comparable traditional radiofrequency lesion diameter become maximal 1 week ( mean=171 mm3 ) measure 6.8mm diameter . Soon one three month , HIFU thalamotomy volume subside 55 14 mm3 , respectively . Thus , small lesion reversible clinical effect would occurre confine first , subtherapeutic/test lesion 50-54⁰C . The therapeutic treatment goal must perform final , peak voxel temperature 55-65⁰C result substantial target ablation analogous volume achieve contemporary RF lesioning . The rationale unilateral subthalamotomy advance PD summarize follow : 1 . A well-placed stereotactic lesion similarly efficacious DBS . 2 . Stereotactic radiofrequency subthalamotomy show ameliorate motor feature PD . 3 . The risk involuntary movement like hemichorea-ballism follow subthalamotomy human 15 % 9 % patient second procedure ( pallidotomy ) need treat dyskinesia . 4 . Studies DBS PD consistently show equivalent result stereotactic target : STN GPi . 5 . The subthalamus amenable image-guided ablation small easily visualized contemporary MRI . 6 . DBS , effective advance PD , complexities patient , caregiver , doctor potentially carry high risk ExAblate mediate lesion . Summary Based publish animal human study , ExAblate Transcranial subthalamotomy safe effective surgical treatment within currently accept standard care include RF lesioning DBS . A unilateral lesion subthalamic nucleus show reduction contralateral motor symptom PD . Using ExAblate Transcranial MRgHIFU create subthalamotomy several potential advantage current therapy include fact transcranial lesioning perform precise manner simultaneous well continuous clinical radiographic monitoring . If potential ExAblate Transcranial subthalamotomy realize , could supplant radiofrequency radiosurgery technique provide viable alternative procedure subject consider DBS . This study include ten Parkinson 's disease patient treat unilateral subthalamotomy perform MRIgHIFU follow open-label fashion 6 month demonstrate safety sustain benefit .</detailed_description>
