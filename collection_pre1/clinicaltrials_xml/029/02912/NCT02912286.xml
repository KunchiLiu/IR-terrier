	<brief_title>Postoperative Pain Following Irrigation With Endodontic Needle , Sonic Passive Ultrasonic Techniques</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Different irrigation delivery system introduce market aim improve root canal disinfection . The conventional endodontic needle commonly use ease use good control needle depth irrigant volume . However carry high risk extrude solution periapically positive pressure use solution delivery . Passive ultrasonic irrigation noncutting irrigation technique do ultrasonically activated file continuous intermittent flow irrigant . It show effective removing remnant pulp tissue , dentin debris planktonic bacteria . The vibringe ( Cavex Holland BV , Haarlem , Netherlands ) irrigation device combine manual delivery sonic activation irrigant . The aim study compare postoperative pain root canal treatment follow irrigation endodontic needle , sonic passive ultrasonic irrigation technique .</detailed_description>
