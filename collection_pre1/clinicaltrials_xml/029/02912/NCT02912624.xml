	<brief_summary>Circulatory shock condition generalize inadequate blood flow body , leading insufficient tissue perfusion inadequate delivery oxygen nutrient , extent tissue damage . Four basic mechanism circulatory failure distinguish , cause scale underlying illness : distributive , hypovolemic , obstructive cardiogenic shock . The last three type characterize low cardiac output hypovolemia . Distributive shock characterize peripheral circulation failure , low systemic vascular resistance , disturb microcirculation high cardiac output . Frequently , form overlap . Shock common problem intensive care unit ( ICU ) affect one third patient . Septic shock appear common type , follow cardiogenic hypovolemic shock . The diagnosis shock base clinical examination use well-known circulatory parameter blood pressure heart rate ; biochemical parameter lactate direct ( semi- ) invasive measurement cardiac output variable . Since cardiac output important determinant oxygen delivery , many different method measure cardiac output suggest . These method range non-invasive invasive measurement central lining . The invasive method , pulmonary artery catheter ( PAC ) long consider optimal form monitoring cardiac output use thermodilution . However , technique associate adverse event , bleeding , clear evidence improve outcome . Therefore , numerous technique propose , range system use dilution technique require central venous peripheral artery line ; less invasive tool estimate cardiac output base arterial pressure waveform ; non-invasive echocardiography . Despite technical advance , much remain unknown value conventionally use hemodynamic parameter estimate cardiac output . A distinction macro- microcirculatory parameter make . Commonly use macro-circulatory parameter heart rate , systolic diastolic blood pressure , mean arterial pressure central venous pressure . Lactate use proxy microcirculatory status . Over year several measurement suggest improve insight hemodynamics certain patient group patient . Skin temperature , capillary refill , mottle score urinary output use hemodynamic assessment peripheral circulation tissue perfusion . Most parameter evaluate large prospective study especially combination parameter directly correlate cardiac output . More knowledge predictive value hemodynamic parameter estimate cardiac output could assist physician early detection impair hemodynamics without need invasive advanced method . In study investigator aim evaluate hemodynamic parameter large unselected population critically ill patient correlate cardiac output . Purpose : The purpose study create infrastructure registry flexible incorporate temporarily add specific research question outcome critically ill patient .</brief_summary>

Other variable ( i.e . lab value ) obtain electronic patient chart later moment . The rationale specific detail measure variable describe extensively . Systemic circulatory variable : - Cardiac output ( CO ) : measure transthoracic echocardiography , perform different trained researcher . Both cardiac output cardiac index ( i.e . cardiac output correct body surface area ) calculate . - Stroke volume ( SV ) : automatically calculate divide cardiac output heart rate , measure transthoracic echocardiography . - Heart rate ( HR ) : record bedside electrocardiographic monitor . In case irregular rhythm ( i.e . atrial fibrillation ) investigator use mean heart rate minute . Apart heart rate presence atrial fibrillation record . - Systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) , diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) : obtain intravascular measurement use arterial line , part usual care . To allow comparison , variable also measure use sphygmomanometer . In latter case , mean arterial pressure calculate use follow formula : MAP = ( SBP + 2*DBP ) /3 - Central venous pressure ( CVP ) : record case central venous line present internal jugular subclavian vene . Micro- peripheral circulatory variable : - Capillary refill time ( CRT ) : measure 15 second exert firm pressure preferably distal phalanx index finger central part knee . The original upper limit normal CRT consider 2 second Champions ' Trauma score . However Schriger Baraff examine CRT healthy population discover age temperature dependent , upper limit healthy old adult 4.5 second . In recent study Ait-Oufella et al find index CRT upper limit 2.4 second predictive 14 day mortality septic shock patient . The investigator therefore use cut-off value 4,5 second continuous measure CRT . - Skin temperature ( Tskin ) : measure subjectively objectively . The subjective measure conduct palpate patient 's extremity . A distinction either 'warm ' 'cold ' make use dorsal surface hand examiner . Patients consider 'cold ' skin extremity examine extremity consider cool , low extremity cool despite warm upper extremity . To objectify skin temperature , use central-to-peripheral peripheral-to-ambient temperature difference ( respectively dTc-p dTp-a ) forearm-to-finger skin-temperature gradient ( Tskin-diff ) propose literature . The investigator make use central-to-peripheral measurement : - Central-to-peripheral temperature difference ( dTc-p ) : measure difference investigator compare bladder temperature , measure bladder thermistor catheter , foot temperature , measure skin probe ( DeRoyal Skin Temperature Sensor product nr 81-010400EU ) either leave right big toe . The investigator use bladder temperature surrogate central temperature , toe temperature peripheral measure . In literature temperature difference either 5°C 7 °C generally use upper limit . The investigator therefore regard value higher 7°C abnormal . - The mottle score : score describe Ait-Oufella et al 2011 . Mottling patchy discoloration skin cause microcirculatory dysfunction . It usually involve area around knee . The Mottling score range 0 -5 , depend extensiveness mottle area . A score 0-1 regard mild , 2-3 moderate 4-5 severe . - Urine output ( ml/kg/h ) : also measure part regular care . The investigator use urine output hour examination mean urine output per hour , calculate use six hour prior physical examination . If data unavailable , mean urine output previous hour ( ) calculate depend available data . In patient pre-existing renal failure urinary output use . Other variable : - Respiratory rate : record bedside electrocardiographic monitor . If patient mechanical ventilation , see . - AVPU scale : use obtain quick impression patient state consciousness consist option : 'Alert ' , 'responsive Voice ' , 'responsive Pain ' 'Unresponsive . ' It often apply emergency room general ward part 'MEWS ' ( Modified Early Warning Score ) . The investigator score AVPU scale separate item . - Cardiac murmur : investigator auscultate heart presence murmur . The potential cause cardiac murmur range completely innocent advance valvular disease , distinctive characteristic . For study purpose , investigator score item : present absent . - Crepitations : investigator auscultate lung crepitation , crackle . In general distinction in- expiratory fine coarse crepitation make . Crepitations symptom several disease , range pneumonia pulmonary edema interstitial lung fibrosis . For study purpose , investigator make distinction : present absent . - Serum lactate , creatinine hemoglobin : determined part regular care . For study purpose investigator use value close examination . - Mechanical ventilation : data presence type mechanical ventilation gather , well basic information respiratory condition ( i.e . PEEP respiratory rate ) . Note : case mechanical ventilation value 'respiratory rate ' fill twice CRF . If value , assume patient breathes machine-set respiratory rate . If differ , spontaneous breathing assume . - Inotrope- vasopressor use : inotrope vasopressin requirement , type , dose speed record . - Estimations pump function peripheral circulation : estimation make , either member treat team , researcher . After physical examination perform , information follow general characteristic extract patient file : demographic data , diagnosis severity illness evaluate APACHE II IV score , Simplified Acute Physiology Score II ( SAPS ) Sequential Organ Failure Assessment ( SOFA ) . Furthermore investigator collect EMV score , lab value ( detail describe ) , urine output ( detail describe ) , routine admission ECG 's routine admission thorax photo 's . After 90 day investigator assess patient file gather information total ICU stay day 7- , 28- 90-day mortality . Data management : Data record use OpenClinica transfer analysis . After transfer OpenClinica , data manage database create use Stata version 14.1 ( StataCorp , College Station , TX ) All study subject receive study subject ID , compile study name inclusion number . This study subject ID use OpenClinica Stata . Only researcher 'study director ' account property OpenClinica able link study subject ID patient number . Images save anonymously cod systematic fashion , use study subject ID , session number , image content . Sample size assessment : There previous study data include combination available hemodynamic variable one model estimate cardiac output mortality . This make difficult calculate sample size . The investigator therefore make estimation base number ICU admission per year . Each year 3000 patient admit one four ICU unit . Approximately 1500 admission unplanned emergency admission . The investigator estimate half unplanned admission fulfill inclusion criterion . This leave 750 patient eligible inclusion . However , investigator assume able include eligible patient logistic practical reason . Therefore investigator aim include 400 patient per year . With emergency admission critical care mortality approach 25 % enable u include least ten variable final model predict mortality ( acknowledge least 10 event necessary variable include final model ) . Plan miss data : Primary analysis perform imputation miss data use multiple imputation . Robustness conclusion check secondary sensitivity analyse include available data . Statistical analysis plan : The investigator use general characteristic create baseline table . Statistical analysis perform use Stata ( StataCorp , College Station , TX ) . Data present mean standard deviation normally distribute median range case skew data . Univariate analysis conduct variable p &lt; 0.1 include multivariate model . Multivariate analysis conduct use stepwise model . Cardiac output model use linear regression mortality model use logistic regression . All analysis adjust age gender ; general characteristic add model standardly . All analysis test two-sided p-values less 0.05 consider statistical significant . If sample size permit , investigator conduct analysis different subpopulation . Examples subpopulation may eligible analysis different type shock ( distributive , obstructive , hypovolemic , cardiogenic ) , CVVH , heart failure cause , myocardial infarction , atrial fibrillation surgery versus no-surgery patient group .</detailed_description>
