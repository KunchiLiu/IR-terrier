	<brief_title>Investigation Differences Skin Sodium Content Between Normal Subjects ICU-patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>According current paradigm ICU-acquired hypernatremia mainly iatrogenic problem , cause sodium overload water deficit . In spite several intervention reduce sodium intake optimize fluid balance , critically ill patient still develop hypernatremia . These patient also seem inability excrete sodium , hence develop positive sodium balance . In animal sodium storage third compartment find . Our hypothesis sodium storage third compartment different critically ill patient difference could play role development ICU-acquired hypernatremia .</detailed_description>
