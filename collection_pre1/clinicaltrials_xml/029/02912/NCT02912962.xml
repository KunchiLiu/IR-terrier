	<brief_summary>Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder ( FASD ) describe collection physical , mental , behavioral disability result prenatal alcohol exposure ( PAE ) . Individuals FASD often struggle self-regulation , ability control thought , emotion action , lead many long-term problematic life circumstance . This study aim improve self-regulation ability adolescent , age 11-17 , FASD use target intervention . Researchers adapt Alert Program® , develop intervention target self-regulation child , appropriate adolescent FASD population . Participants split two group : FASD intervention group , FASD waitlist group . These group compare variety measure . These measure include cognitive measure ( executive functioning , response conflict , inhibitory control , etc ) , behavioural measure ( self-regulation , adaptive behaviour , etc ) , physiological measure ( cortisol sleep ) . The FASD intervention group test baseline intervention , lastly approximately 12-week wait follow intervention . The FASD waitlist group test baseline , three month wait period , receive intervention . The investigator expect Alert program® lead significant improvement participant 's self-regulation ability evidence cognitive , behavioural , physiological change . Improving self-regulation adolescent FASD reduce high level adverse outcomes experienced adolescent FASD , help successful transition adulthood .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Self-Regulation Adolescents With FASD : The Efficacy Targeted Intervention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives : The goal propose research determine adolescent Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder ( FASD ) improvements ability self-regulate implementation target intervention . The project part large NeuroDevNet renewal grant . The goal propose project study adolescent FASD examine : 1 ) association measure Executive Function ( EF ) self-regulation life adversity adverse outcomes 2 ) cortisol regulation FASD association life adversity difficulty EF , self-regulation , sleep , adverse outcomes 3 ) whether EF , self-regulation , sleep , cortisol regulation improve intervention target self-regulation . Research question : Can self-regulation among adolescent FASD improve target intervention ? The investigator hypothesize participant FASD modify Alert Program ® intervention great improvement cognitive , behavioral , physiological measure self-regulation compare wait-list control group . 1 . How self-regulation impacted adolescent FASD ? The investigator hypothesize adolescent FASD significantly low score ( baseline ) variety measure self-regulation include cognitive , behavioral , physiological measure ( cortisol regulation sleep behavior ) compare normative sample . This information important informing profile self-regulation impairment FASD . 2 . Do improvement self-regulation lead improvement functional outcome adolescent FASD ? The investigator hypothesize follow intervention , participant FASD show improvement report functional outcome measure adaptive functioning . Background : Individuals FASD display significant executive functioning ( EF ) impairment ( e.g. , inhibition , decision making , think flexibly ) well difficulty regulate behavior . They risk early life adversity ( e.g. , unstable home environment ) adverse outcome include mental health issue , delinquency , substance abuse . Adverse outcomes FASD may result EF self-regulation impairment potential mitigate targeted intervention . Altered hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA ) activity , indexed plasma cortisol level , physiological marker self-regulation . Importantly , PAE know affect HPA activity regulation . Sleep behavior also disrupt FASD , another physiological marker self-regulation . Recognizing profile self-regulation deficit FASD , functional outcome impairment equip investigator examine impact intervention effort self-regulation . Research efficacy intervention improve various index self-regulation FASD critical , may prevent later adverse outcome . The Alert Program® evidence-based intervention program focus self-regulation . It widely-used program demonstrate efficacy child FASD improvement parental report EF , behavioural emotional regulation , test social cognition , inhibitory control emotional problem-solving . The investigator anticipate intervention , study adolescent FASD , lead improvement across range self-regulatory function include cognitive , behavioral , physiological indicator . Method : Participants . FASD Group : Recruitment data collection Alberta occur Dr. Rasmussen 's Pei 's research lab Glenrose Rehabilitation Hospital ( GRH ) Dr. Oberlander Child Family Research Institute University British Columbia ( separate University British Columbia ethic application ) . The GRH facility consist test room , office , workstation . Participants participate previous research study Drs . Pei Rasmussen inform study research assistant provide information letter . Parents opportunity discus study set appointment research assistant may contact lab later time choose participate . Eligible participant currently involve investigator ' study receive information letter FASD Clinic GRH describe study eligible participant ( mail see clinic ) , blind researcher . Interested caregiver contact researcher want participate , project coordinator book test session . For cognitive assessment , train Research Assistant administer assessment measure participant caregiver complete questionnaire rating scale . For interested participant recently involve another study , cognitive test result share study minimize baseline testing time participant , reduce practice effect measure re-administered within short time frame . Caregivers also complete 45-minute training module worksheet ( ~15 minute ) baseline test . This training module provide overview program well discuss five category ( mouth , move , touch , look listen ) form base intervention strategy teen . An RA train intervention access Occupational Therapy consult conduct intervention . Procedure : Study Design : All participant FASD test assessment battery Baseline ( Time 0 ) provide important information profile self-regulation impairment FASD , well baseline data efficacy intervention evaluate . The FASD group divide target intervention group ( Group A ) waitlist control group ( Group B ) group test battery test intervention . The waitlist group test wait period , receive intervention . This mixed design allow investigator control change due development , practice effect , regression mean , familiarity procedure . Rolling recruitment require intervention run time , ensure sufficient staff resource administer intervention . The investigator feel important provide intervention participant use waitlist design timely manner ethical clinical reason . The Alert Program® administer individually participant train RA occupational therapist ( e.g . post-doctoral fellow graduate student Psychology Occupational Therapy ) investigator ' lab space . A different RA conduct post intervention test . Baseline test conduct interventionist RA order establish rapport gain clinical knowledge plan individualize session meet participant need . The intervention base teen adaptation Alert Program develop Therapy Works Inc modify research team meet need adolescent FASD . The intervention consist 12 one hour session take place course 9-15 week . Over course 12 session participant work move 3 stage ( stage 1 - identifying engine speed , stage 2- learning strategy change engine level , stage 3 - regulating engine speed ) . Measures : The investigator use number different measure pre post analysis behavioural , cognitive , physiological change . The behavioural measure : background questionnaire , Behavioural Rating Inventory Executive Function ( BRIEF ) - 2 , Monetary Choice Questionnaire , Dot-Probe Test Attention Bias Threat , Adolescent Self-Regulatory Inventory ( ASRI ) , Adaptive Behaviour Rating System ( ABAS ) -2 , Child Behavior Checklist ( CBCL ) ( youth self-report , caregiver report ) , The Stressful Urban Life Events Scale . The cognitive measure : Wide Range Intelligence Test ( WRIT ) , Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System ( D-KEFS ) , Iowa Gambling Test ( IGT ) , Whack-A-Mole Test , Rey Complex Figure Test . The physiological measure include salivary cortisol fingernail cortisol sample , Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire ( PSQ ) .</detailed_description>
