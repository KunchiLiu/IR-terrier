	<detailed_description>Shorter radiation , deliver 3 4 week , standard treatment woman receive radiation breast . Clinical research study 10 year follow show shorter radiation , deliver 3 4 week , provide similar cancer control long radiation , deliver 5 6 week , woman receive radiation therapy breast . Additionally woman receive short radiation less likely develop radiation side effect . Shorter radiation well studied woman receive radiation therapy deliver lymph node near breast lymph . However , short radiation may also reduce side effect radiation lymph node near breast . If agree take part study , complete questionnaires general health , arm function , breast chest currently look feel . This take 15 minute complete . The size volume arm measure perometer . The arm insert vertical horizontal frame size volume arm measure use light beam . You also physical exam medical history record . Study Groups : You randomly assign ( flip coin ) 1 2 group . You equal chance assign group . Group 1 receive short radiation . Group 2 receive standard radiation . If Group 1 , receive 3 week radiation ( 15 treatment ) entire breast chest wall lymph node area . If Group 2 , receive 5 week radiation ( 25 treatment ) entire breast chest wall lymph node area . Participants group also 5-8 additional treatment radiation `` boost '' . The boost deliver part breast disease first start lumpectomy deliver chest wall mastectomy . You receive separate consent form radiation therapy . Study Visits : You blood draw ( 1 teaspoon ) routine test within 3 month prior receive radiation within first week start radiation treatment . While receive radiation , routine visit , ask side effect may week . Follow-up Visits : You return clinic follow-up visit 6 18 month radiation . You visit every year 10 ½ year completion radiation . At Months 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 66 , 126 month radiation therapy , complete questionnaires general health arm function arm volume measure . Length Study : Your participation study 126 month ( 10 ½ year ) visit . This investigational study . Both standard short radiation course deliver use FDA-approved commercially available method . The goal study compare 2 treatment . Up 290 participant enrol study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Radiation oncologist recommend radiation treatment supraclavicular infraclavicular fossa ( i.e . RNI ) . 2 . Pathologicallyconfirmed invasive breast cancer . If patient undergo upfront surgery , pathologic stage must T0T3 , N0N2a . If patient receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior surgery , clinical stage must T0T3 N0N2a . 3 . Treatment mastectomy segmental mastectomy axillary evaluation ( sentinel node evaluation axillary lymph node dissection ) . If patient T0 disease , breast surgery require . 4 . Age 18 year old . 5 . Documentation arm volume measurement perometer prior axillary surgery . 6 . If patient history prior nonbreast cancer , treatment cancer must complete prior study registration , patient must evidence disease prior nonbreast cancer . 7 . Patients must enrol trial within 12 week later two date : final breast cancer surgical procedure administration last cycle cytotoxic chemotherapy . 1 . Pathologic clinical evidence stage T4 breast cancer . 2 . Pathologic clinical evidence stage N2b N3 breast cancer ( supraclavicular , internal mammary lymph node involvement ) . 3 . Clinical pathologic evidence distant metastasis . 4 . Any prior diagnosis invasive ductal carcinoma situ breast cancer either breast . 5 . Current diagnosis bilateral breast cancer . 6 . History therapeutic irradiation breast , low neck , mediastinum area could potentially overlap affected breast . 7 . Patient pregnant .</criteria>
