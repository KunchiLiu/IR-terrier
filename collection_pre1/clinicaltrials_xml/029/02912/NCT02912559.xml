	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study combination chemotherapy atezolizumab see well work compare combination chemotherapy alone treat patient stage III colon cancer deficient deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) mismatch repair microsatellite instability . Drugs use combination chemotherapy , oxaliplatin , leucovorin calcium , fluorouracil , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Monoclonal antibody , atezolizumab , may interfere ability tumor cell grow spread . Giving combination chemotherapy atezolizumab may work good combination chemotherapy alone treat patient colon cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy With Without Atezolizumab Treating Patients With Stage III Colon Cancer Deficient DNA Mismatch Repair Microsatellite Instability</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether atezolizumab combine oxaliplatin , leucovorin calcium , fluorouracil ( FOLFOX ) continuation monotherapy significantly improve disease-free survival ( DFS ) compare FOLFOX alone patient stage III colon cancer high-frequency microsatellite instability ( MSI-H ) deficient DNA mismatch repair ( dMMR ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether atezolizumab combine FOLFOX continuation monotherapy significantly improve overall survival compare FOLFOX alone patient stage III colon cancer MSI-H dMMR . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine impact addition atezolizumab FOLFOX patient health-related quality life ( QOL ) , functional domain health-related QOL , disease- treatment-related symptom . II . To determine `` immunoscore '' predict efficacy atezolizumab disease-free survival among patient stage III colon cancer . III . To assess whether circulate immune cell population predict efficacy atezolizumab adjuvant therapy stage III colon cancer . IV . To explore association genomic alteration identify cell-free ( cf ) DNA DFS patient treat FOLFOX without atezolizumab . V. To assess whether soluble marker systemic inflammation blood predict efficacy atezolizumab adjuvant therapy stage III colon cancer . VI . To assess relationship baseline plasma 25 ( OH ) D level , change 25 ( OH ) D level , DFS overall survival ( OS ) patient stage III colon cancer receive FOLFOX +/- atezolizumab . VII . To determine ability use fecal microbiota metabolic product predict survival benefit anti-PD-L1 antibody therapy dMMR/MSI-H colon cancer patient . VIII . To determine hypermutation hyper-indel status associate response atezolizumab . IX . To determine unique messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA ) expression signature predictive disease-free survival among patient receive adjuvant chemotherapy stage III colon cancer . X . To determine efficacy atezolizumab differs among dMMR/MSI cancer due germline MMR mutation ( MLH1 , MSH2 , MSH6 , PMS2 ) versus MLH1 hypermethylation CIMP patient stage III colon cancer . XI . To identify overall mutational burden number putative tumor neoantigens colon carcinoma specimen . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 arm . ARM I : Patients receive oxaliplatin intravenously ( IV ) 2 hour leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour day 1 , fluorouracil IV bolus day 1 , continuously 46 hour day 1-3 . Treatment repeat every 14 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients also receive atezolizumab IV 30-60 minute start day 1 course 1 2 . Treatment repeat every 14 day 25 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive oxaliplatin IV 2 hour leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour day 1 , fluorouracil IV bolus day 1 , continuously 46 hour day 1-3 . Treatment repeat every 14 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 month every 6 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
