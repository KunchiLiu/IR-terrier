	<detailed_description>Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) psoriatic arthritis ( PsA ) chronic , systemic inflammatory disorder affect 1-2 % US population . Ongoing chronic inflammation lack exercise due arthritis associate pain , fatigue , depression , muscle loss , obesity , development chronic disease cardiovascular disease diabetes , impact physical functioning quality life . Increases physical activity significantly impact one outcomes likely positively impact patient experience disease . This study examine benefit monitored physical activity program . This study use wearable activity device ( e.g . fitbit ) monitor step count incentivize one group achieve high step count control group . The primary goal pilot study determine whether one incentive ( loss aversion ) well incentive increase step count maintain increase level physical activity . Additional outcomes interest patient report disease activity ( use RAPID3 patient report outcome ) physician measure disease activity , quality life assessment weight loss .</detailed_description>
