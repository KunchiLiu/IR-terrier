	<brief_summary>Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia ( ALL ) frequent cancer child . The survival rate improve significantly last decade , treatment still fail cure 15 % patient . Within Nordic/Baltic country , child treat accord protocol , i.e . NOPHO ALL-2008 protocol . The long treatment phase maintenance therapy , compose 6-Mercaptopurine ( 6MP ) Methotrexate ( MTX ) . The cytotoxic property 6MP relies upon conversion 6MP thioguanine nucleotide ( TGN ) , incorporate DNA instead guanine adenine . This incorporation cause nuclotide mismathing cause cell death second repetitive activation mismatch repair system . At Rigshospitalet investigator develop pharmacological method able measure incorporation TGN DNA ( DNA-TGN ) . In Nordic/Baltic study investigator demonstrate high level DNA-TGN maintenance therapy participant develop relapse . Preliminary study indicate best approach obtain DNA-TGN within target range could combination 6MP , MTX 6-thioguanine ( 6TG ) , 6TG readily convert TGN . This study aim explore individual dose titration 6TG add 6MP/MTX therapy achieve DNA-TGN level set target 500 fmol/µg DNA , thus integrated future ALL treatment strategy reduce relapse rate ALL . The investigator plan include 30 patient , A ) give incremental dos 6TG DNA-TGN 500 fmol/µg DNA obtain ; B ) analyze change DNA-TGN well cytosol level TGN , methylated 6MP metabolite , MTX polyglutamates ( latter two metabolite inhibit purine de novo synthesis thus enhance DNA-TGN incorporation ) , C ) occurrence bone-marrow liver toxicity 6TG/6MP/MTX therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia ( ALL ) frequent cancer child . Each year approximately 220 child diagnose ALL within Nordic Baltic country . The survival rate improve significantly last decade , treatment still fail cure approximately 15 % patient . A significant proportion relapse likely reflect adverse drug disposition rather resistence antileukemic agent . This emphazises importance develop new dose strategy reduction relapse rate . Most ALL relapse occur maintenance therapy , recent study indicate almost 50 % relapse cause insuffient exposure DNA cytotoxic metabolites 6MP . The cytotoxic property 6MP relies upon conversion 6MP thioguanine nucleotide ( TGN ) . TGN substrate DNA polymerase , incorporate DNA instead guanosine adenine ( DNA-TGN ) . Incorporated TGN hereafter occasionally mismatch thymidine , cause cell death second activation mismatch repair system . During thiopurine-based therapy patient vary widely DNA-TGN level patient low DNA-TGN level may increase risk relapse . The investigator explore 1 . If individualize addition 6TG maintenance therapy increase DNA-TGN target 500 fmol/µg DNA ; 2 . The toxicity encounter 6TG/6MP/MTX therapy . The investigator hypothesize 6TG/6MP/MTX combination therapy achieve significantly high DNA-TGN level , describe toxicity thiopurine metabolite level MTX/6MP/6TG combination therapy . The TEAM Study design prospective , multicentre , non-controlled ( except historical control ) , non-randomised , phase 1-2 clinical trial . This trial `` proof principle '' feasibility study plan modify crossover design , participant serve ( historical ) control . Pharmacological target : The investigator include 30 participant . Two week prior first addition 6TG , 6MP dose reduce 2/3rd give 6MP dose reduce level methylated metabolite , thus degree inhibition purine de novo synthesis . The investigator A ) give incremental dos 6TG ( step 2.5 mg/meter square , max 12.5 mg/meter square ) DNA-TGN least 500 fmol/µg DNA obtain ; B ) analyze change DNA-TGN well Ery-TGN/MeMP/MTXpg . The dose increment 6TG step 2.5 mg/square metre space interval least two week , DNA-TGN measurement measure weekly 6TG dose increment . 6TG dose increment continue DNA-TGN &gt; 500 fmol/µg maximum dose 6TG 12.5 mg/square metre reach . If tolerate , participant continue 6TG dose end ALL therapy . Participants time point drop TEAM decision treat physician . 6TG provide liquid formulation ease precise dose titration .</detailed_description>
