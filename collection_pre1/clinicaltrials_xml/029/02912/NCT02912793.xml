	<brief_summary>This research study conduct find whether Trappsol® Cyclo™ , experimental treatment people Niemann-Pick disease Type C1 ( NPC-1 ) safe 3 different dose level effect people condition . NPC-1 cause defect protein important transport fatty substance like cholesterol cell . Without protein , fat build cell ultimately lead organ damage . The way experimental treatment work fully understood laboratory experiment show potentially remove cholesterol build cell people NPC-1 . Approximately 12 patient ask take part research study 56 week total . recruitment expect take 9 months.Patients take part receive treatment intravenous infusion every two week . The study look body drug well drug body take examine blood urine sample . Samples Cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) also take lumbar puncture follow first treatment dose . Patients also hear test , ask question doctor well complete questionnaire help assess change condition treatment . Optional assessment patient choose take part include liver biopsy , additional lumbar puncture CSF.examinations see drug affect . This study sponsor funded CTD holding INC . It plan run UK , Italy , Sweden .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The plan study design Phase I/II , double-blind , randomise , multi-centre , parallel group study base information data available administration Trappsol Cyclo via compassionate/named patient use patient NPC-1 , data cyclodextrin product scientific literature . The study comprise two stage . The primary objective Stage 1 compare plasma pharmacokinetics three different dos IV Trappsol Cyclo prevention /delay NPC-1 progression.Secondary objective include investigation Hydroxypropyl Beta Cyclodextrin ( HP-β-CD ) effect three different dos IV Trappsol Cyclo upon serum lymphocytic marker cholesterol metabolism ( Stages 1 2 ) evaluation concentration cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) follow intravenous ( IV ) administration ( Stage 1 ) , evaluation impact treatment upon measure neurological function include ataxia , aphasia saccadic eye movement , impact treatment upon behavioural aspect NPC-1 ( Stage 2 ) . It plan recruit total 12 patient study . Patients randomise 1:1:1 one three dose level ( 1500 mg/kg , 2000 mg/kg 2500 mg/kg ; four patient per dose level ) . Treatment administer every two week slow IV infusion concentration 250 mg/mL 8 hour . Patients complete Stage 1 study continue Stage 2 receive treatment 48 week . Patients withdraw prior completion initial pharmacokinetic ( PK ) pharmacodynamics ( PD ) assessment replace . The design propose study thus enable early assessment biochemical marker response allow sufficient dose duration enable effectiveness Trappsol NPC-1 assess . As miglustat approve treatment NPC-1 EU , establish efficacy safety profile , would unethical exclude patient receive miglustat therapy study , give study also conduct site Europe . However , plan balance randomisation across treatment group use . The maximum dose propose study maximum dose long term clinical data available 2 patient ( 2800 mg/kg weekly 3-5 year ) . Although individual clinician always utilise escalate rate infusion , report infusion relate reaction three patient suggest appropriate clinical strategy mitigate risk event consistent dose administration therapeutic agent . In proposed study , treatment administer less frequently undertaken compassionate use . This longer dose interval support nonclinical data compare metabolism cholesterol non-human specie man ; although weekly dose interval initially study man base data mouse , HP-β-CD cholesterol metabolism/turnover mouse 13-fold high man , NPC-1 , likely translate 13-fold slow accumulation cholesterol human cell compare mouse.Therefore , theorise , give slow cholesterol metabolism human , dose interval could much less frequent man mouse ; however , base know cholesterol metabolism human pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic effect HP-β-CD mouse , dose interval 2 week man likely well within therapeutic dosing interval also minimise amount infusion require administer .</detailed_description>
