	<brief_title>Study Avelumab Patients With MSS , MSI-H POLE-mutated Recurrent Persistent Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study Phase II clinical trial . Phase II clinical trial test effectiveness investigational drug learn whether drug work treat specific cancer . `` Investigational '' mean drug still study research doctor try find it-such safest dose use , side effect may cause , drug effective treat different type cancer . It also mean FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) yet approve drug use patient , include people Metastatic Endometrial Cancer . Avelumab drug may stop cancer cell grow enable activation immune system . Avelumab block immune inhibit signal impair ability immune system attack cancer . In research study , investigator look see whether Avelumab effective treating recurrent Metastatic Endometrial Cancer . Additionally , investigator look see participant whose tumor contain particular genetic make-up well response Avelumab .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must classify one two cohort recurrent persistent endometrial cancer histology : The first cohort ( MSI/POLE cohort ) include endometrial cancer : MSIH determine immunohistochemical complete loss expression ( absence nuclear immunoreactivity ) least one mismatch repair gene MSH2 , MSH6 , MLH1 PMS2 . This test do routinely every newly diagnose endometrial cancer patient center US . And/OR : POLEmutated , i.e . endometrial cancer know harbor mutation exonuclease domain ( amino acid residue 268471 ) polymerase e ( POLE ) determine target sequence next generation sequence assay . Any Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments ( CLIA ) approve genomic test document mutation exonuclease domain POLE gene ( amino acid residue 268471 ) tumor accept proof presence POLE mutation lead classification patient cohort . The second cohort ( MSS cohort ) include : Endometrial cancer MSS determine normal immunohistochemical nuclear expression mismatch repair gene MSH2 , MSH6 , MLH1 PMS2 . Tumors sequence POLE mutation ( i.e . POLE mutation status unknown ) MSS , include cohort . All patient must measurable disease define RECIST 1.1 . Measurable disease define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) . Each lesion must &gt; = 10 mm measure CT , MRI caliper measurement clinical exam ; &gt; = 20 mm measure chest xray . Lymph node must &gt; 15 mm short axis measure CT MRI . Prior Therapy : There upper limit prior therapy patient must one prior chemotherapeutic regimen management endometrial carcinoma . Initial treatment may include chemotherapy , chemotherapy radiation therapy , and/or consolidation/maintenance therapy . Any platinum base chemotherapy ( single agent platinum platinum doublet ) administer conjunction primary radiation radiosensitizer WILL count systemic chemotherapy regimen . Furthermore , patient receive chemotherapy adjuvant set eligible study . Prior hormonal therapy allow . Patients must NOT receive class drug target PD1/PDL1 pathway . Age 18 great year . Because insufficient dose adverse event data currently available use Avelumab participant &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study . Endometrial cancer rare pediatric population . ECOG performance status 0 1 ( reference Appendix A ECOG performance status criterion ) . Availability formalin fix paraffin embed ( FFPE ) block cancer tissue original surgery biopsy biopsy recurrent disease . Participants must normal organ marrow function define : absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/mcL platelet &gt; 100,000/mcL hemoglobin ≥ 9g/dL total bilirubin within normal institutional limit AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤2.5 × institutional upper limit normal creatinine within normal institutional limit OR creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 participant creatinine level institutional normal . Participant must pregnant breastfeed give avelumab agent unknown effect pregnancy breastfeed potential teratogenesis . Females childbearing potential define surgically sterile ( i.e. , bilateral tubal ligation , bilateral oophorectomy , complete hysterectomy ) postmenopausal ( define ≥ 12 month menses without alternative medical cause ) . Serum pregnancy test ( female childbearing potential ) negative screening . The effect avelumab develop human fetus unknown . For reason immunomodulatory agent know teratogenic , woman childbearing potential must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Toxicities prior therapy ( except alopecia sensory neuropathy ) resolve &lt; grade 2 per revise NCI Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version 4 . All appropriate treatment area access copy CTCAE version 4 . A copy CTCAE version 4 download CTEP website : http : //ctep.cancer.gov . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Participants chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Participants receive investigational agent . Participants know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . History allergic reaction attribute avelumab component formulation , compound similar chemical biologic composition avelumab . Known severe hypersensitivity reaction monoclonal antibody ( Grade ≥ 3 NCI CTCAE v 4.03 ) , history anaphylaxis , uncontrolled asthma ( , 3 feature partially control asthma ) Participants history treatment antiPD1 , antiPDL1 , antiCTLA4 investigational agent target immune checkpoint inhibitor . Known human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) acquire immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) relate illness , may compromise efficacy immunostimulatory therapy . Positive test HBV surface antigen / confirmatory HCV RNA ( antiHCV antibody test positive ) Subjects require hormone replacement corticosteroid eligible steroid administer purpose hormonal replacement dos ≤ 10 mg 10 mg equivalent prednisone per day Active infection require systemic therapy . Current prior use immunosuppressive medication within 7 day prior enrollment follow exception exclusion criterion : Intranasal , inhale , topical steroid , local steroid injection ( eg , intraarticular injection ) ; Systemic corticosteroid physiologic dos exceed 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent ; Steroids premedication hypersensitivity reaction ( eg , CT scan premedication ) . Active autoimmune disease might deteriorate receive immunostimulatory agent . Patients diabetes type I , vitiligo , psoriasis , hypo hyperthyroid disease require immunosuppressive treatment eligible . Prior organ transplantation include allogeneic stemcell transplantation . Persisting Grade &gt; =2 toxicity relate prior therapy ; however , Grade 2 sensory neuropathy acceptable . Severe gastrointestinal condition clinical radiological evidence bowel obstruction within 4 week prior study entry , uncontrolled diarrhea last 4 week prior enrollment , history inflammatory bowel disease . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Clinically significant ( i.e. , active ) cardiovascular disease : cerebral vascular accident/stroke ( &lt; 6 month prior enrollment ) , myocardial infarction ( &lt; 6 month prior enrollment ) , unstable angina , congestive heart failure ( ≥ New York Heart Association Classification Class II ) , serious cardiac arrhythmia require medication . Known alcohol drug abuse . Individuals history different malignancy ineligible except follow circumstance : Individuals history malignancy eligible diseasefree least 5 year deem investigator low risk recurrence malignancy . Individuals follow cancer eligible diagnose treat within past 5 year : breast cancer situ , cervical cancer situ , basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin . All significant disease ( example , inflammatory bowel disease , uncontrolled asthma ) , , opinion Investigator , might impair subject 's tolerance trial treatment . Any psychiatric condition would prohibit understanding rendering informed consent Vaccination within 4 week first dose avelumab trial prohibit except administration inactivate vaccinespremed</criteria>
