	<brief_title>Perioperative Chemotherapy VS Postoperative Chemotherapy Treatment Colon Cancer With Resectable Liver Metastasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Colon cancer ( colorectal cancer CRC ) one common malignant tumor digestive tract , become global incidence third malignant tumor , include colorectal cancer proportion increase year year . With way life resident country , adjustment diet age progress , incidence colorectal cancer rise trend , patient find advanced disease . Tumor metastasis important factor affect prognosis colon cancer , liver metastasis , especially , include simultaneous liver metastasis delay liver metastasis colon cancer , 20 % 34 % appear time liver metastasis , 40-50 % CRC patient die liver metastasis present , multi disciplinary team treatment surgical treatment absolute dominance attention , benefit , optimum sequence chemotherapy surgery , still unclear . The preoperative chemotherapy Potential advantage include : early treatment micrometastasis ; assessment tumor response chemotherapy ( prognostic value , contribute development postoperative treatment plan ) ; patient early progression avoid local treatment . Preoperative treatment potential disadvantage include : miss surgery opportunity window period `` , probably early stage tumor progress , may also chemotherapy achieve complete remission determine extent resection surgery become extremely difficult.2015 second edition NNCN guideline resectable metastatic disease initial resectable patient may liver resection , adjuvant chemotherapy postoperative ; another alternative treatment mode around perioperative chemotherapy ( perioperative chemotherapy postoperative chemotherapy ) . Therefore , gap determination timing chemotherapy still guide , worth explore . I center carry laparoscopic resection colon cancer ten year , accumulate number case 1000 case , rich experience colon cancer . Comprehensive treatment include surgery , oncology , Radiology , pathology , Department radiotherapy , number department , Department endoscopy MDT team , outstanding team Chinese Medical Doctor Association 2016 MDT honor . This study use prospective randomized method , evaluation colon cancer simultaneous resectable liver metastatic lesion peri chemotherapy surgery neoadjuvant chemotherapy two therapeutic scheme short-term long-term effect , expect summarize prospective data support operation chemotherapy</detailed_description>
