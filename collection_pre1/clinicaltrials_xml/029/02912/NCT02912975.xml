	<brief_title>A Clinical Trial Mirror Treatment Phantom Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study conduct two phase : Firstly , effect mirror treatment ( M ) versus tactile treatment ( T ) compare open , randomize , semi-cross-over case-control design study . The second phase include responder initial treatment ( M T ) , duration initial treatment effect observe , effect second round similar treatment register . Phase one : The study patient randomize M T treatment . The main outcome variable gather initial randomization initial treatment period three week . Non-responders ( NR ) allocate immediate second three-weeks treatment period combine treatment ( M+T ) ; responder ( R ) M , T M+T enter second phase study . The M+T non-responders discontinue study . Phase two : The responder observe period maximum three month . When symptom phantom limb pain and/or CRPS resume , patient undergo second treatment period treatment phase one . The duration second treatment period maximum three week , patient may decide interrupt treatment earlier stage find effect satisfactory . The main outcome indicator gather start end second treatment period . The study close end second treatment period . For study phase treatment effect compare stratum also inside stratum , use patient control .</detailed_description>
