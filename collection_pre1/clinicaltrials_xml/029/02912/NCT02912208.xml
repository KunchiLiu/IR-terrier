	<brief_summary>Myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) prevail old age characterize ineffective erythropoiesis peripheral cytopenia . Supportive therapy main therapeutic option patient . Quality Life ( QoL ) mainly deteriorate anemia limitation associate thrombocytopenia , neutropenia transfusion dependence . The available treatment severe thrombocytopenia , presence bleeding , platelet transfusion . Eltrombopag orally bioavailable agonist thrombopoietin receptor . In adult patient chronic immune thrombocytopenia ( ITP ) , Eltrombopag rapidly increase platelet count significantly reduce bleed episode treatment . Eltrombopag well tolerate . In 2007 , Eltrombopag receive Orphan Drug Designation treatment ITP ( EMEA/OD/031/07 ) , 2008 Food Drug Association approve Eltrombopag treatment ITP refractory resistant . It show patient affect MDS acute myeloid leukemia , Eltrombopag neither increase proliferation , clonogenic growth capacity bone marrow blast . Furthermore , Eltrombopag induce increase megakaryocytic differentiation formation normal megakaryocytic colony . These result provide rationale pursue research Eltrombopag treatment thrombocytopenia case MDS . The study open adult patient myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) thrombocytopenia low- intermediate-1 IPSS risk ( Index Prognostic Score System ) . Severe thrombocytopenia associate MDS may lead death hemorrhage , even low prognostic risk patient . The benefit platelet transfusion short-termed . Patients become refractory long term . The availability treatment induces increase platelet count extremely important , either term quality life , overall survival .</brief_summary>
