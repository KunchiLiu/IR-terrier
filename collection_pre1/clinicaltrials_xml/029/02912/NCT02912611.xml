Each site comprise cluster ( include 3-4 health center - 1 district hospital - 1 regional referral hospital ) service population around site area . Patients present health care clinic hospital emergency department sign symptom associate high moderate risk develop AKI undergo point care ( POC ) test measure serum creatinine , saliva urea nitrogen dipstick ( exclusively Malawi ) , urine dipstick test color , protein , glucose , blood specific gravity . Patients meet study inclusion criterion approach consent . Patients enrol study follow throughout health care evaluation track course location i.e . health care center , hospital , home . Outcomes record 6 month follow health care evaluation . The protocol initial observation phase , relevant healthcare staff research team train identify patient moderate high risk AKI use point care ( POC ) test serum creatinine , saliva urea nitrogen dipstick ( exclusively Malawi ) , urine dipstick test . During phase patient track throughout health care evaluation , however teleconsultation implement specific guidance manage patient provide . During subsequent intervention phase , research team interact local healthcare provider teleconsultation physician , provide guidance management patient base standardize protocol .
