	<brief_title>A Therapeutic Trial Human Amniotic Epithelial Cells Transplantation Primary Ovarian Insufficiency Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary ovarian insufficiency（POI ) defect characterize premature depletion ovarian follicle . Patients POF suffer amenorrhea , infertility , low level estrogen , high gonadotropin concentration age 40 . The early failure ovarian function lead lose fertility increase risk osteoporosis cardiovascular disease , serious impact patient 's physical , mental health family stability . The etiology POI complex , far effective treatment . Recent study show human amniotic epithelial cell ( hAECs ) , also know birth waste , newly discover adult stem cell . The hAECs ability repair nerve damage , myocardial injury , well liver damage . hAECs low immunogenicity ethical restriction . Therefore , hAECs expect become new seed cell regenerative medicine . Our previous study first show human amniotic epithelial cell ability restore folliculogenesis mouse model chemotherapy-induced premature ovarian failure . Our study demonstrate hAECs either directly transdifferentiated granulosa cell , inhibited tumor necrosis factor-alpha-mediated granulosa cell apoptosis reduce inflammatory reaction ovary induce chemotherapeutics , regulate VEGFA receptor induce follicular growth related paracrine activity . Therefore , necessary start clinical study human amniotic epithelial cell transplantation POI disease may offer novel therapeutic strategy improve quality life POI patient .</detailed_description>
