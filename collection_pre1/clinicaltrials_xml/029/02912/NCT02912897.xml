	<brief_summary>The etiologic mechanism involve multiple sclerosis ( MS ) yet fully understood . Indeed MS multifactorial disease involve genetic environmental factor Epstein-Barr-Virus ( EBV ) could one factor . However link EBV infection immunological mechanism underlie MS clear . Robust sero-epidemiological evidence support association EBV infection MS , immunological data suggest altered/deficient immune response virus . In healthy individual EBV produce persistent infection tightly control immune system . In patient MS , cellular humoral immune study demonstrate alter response virus T-cell abnormal reactivity EBV-infected autologous B-cells , elevate humoral immune response Epstein Barr Nuclear Antigen-1 , case child , increase EBV shed , demonstrate frequent EBV reactivations . Thus , propose , patient MS present partially inefficient control EBV infection . Some experimental data support hypothesis suggest presence autoreactive EBV-B cell meninges patient , probably due insufficient clearance cell immune system , lead infiltration autoreactive T cell . Another hypothesis also suggest deficient control virus , case inactive phase disease . Together , data hypothesis lead notion immune intervention capable restore host-EBV balance could beneficial MS patient In project , assess feasibility safety autologous transfer several amount CD8 T cell direct autologous EBV transform B cell line , order finally restore efficient control EBV MS patient . The main objective project test feasibility safety process , efficacy parameter also assess secondary objective .</brief_summary>
