	<brief_summary>Postural change commonly use therapeutic maneuver enhance reduce cerebral perfusion . For instance , acute stroke , patient position head tilt position increase perfusion cerebral tissue perfusion . In During stroke hypertensive patient stroke , vary degree various loss cerebral autoregulation loss usually observe . The aim study assess cerebral perfusion ASL perfusion human subject different condition : healthy , hypertensive stroke .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cerebral Perfusion Associated With Postural Changes : ASL MR Perfusion Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Material method : Eighteen stroke patient , eighteen hypertensive patient eighteen healthy subject ( men woman ) enrol . The investigator use 1.5 Tesla MRI device large magnet bore ( 70 cm ) allow position change . Two measure perform , one supine position head position ( -20Â° ) . A 3D FSE ASL sequence acquire Cerebral Blood Flow ( CBF ) map reconstruct . Volume interest ( VOI ) place cortical grey matter ( frontal posterior gyrus ) , subcortical deep grey matter ( caudate nucleus , thalamus ) subcortical white matter ( semi oval center ) . Differences CBF value ( mL/100g/min ) analyze use SAS 9.3 software Windows ( SAS Institute , Cary North Carolina , USA ) . Expected result hypothesis : CBF expect significantly vary supine head position . It expect least increase head position , stroke patient . For healthy subject hypertensive patient , cerebral autoregulation may limit CBF increase although increase trend CBF expect .</detailed_description>
