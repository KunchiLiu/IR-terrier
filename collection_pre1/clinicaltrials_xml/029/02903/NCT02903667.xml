	<brief_title>Biomaterial Counteract Ridge Reduction Following Removal Multiple Adjacent Teeth .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The removal least 2 adjacent teeth would cause advanced hard tissue loss heal occur removal single tooth adjacent teeth present . In order maintain dimension ridge follow tooth removal , bone graft bone substitute also place extraction socket . So far data report effect removal multiple adjacent teeth bone loss various aspect edentulous site . Furthermore , potential effect ridge contraction implant placement multiple fresh extraction site document . Therefore , objective study evaluate possibility counteract un favourable ridge model multiple tooth extraction place mineral bovine bone extraction socket cover wound native collagen membrane . In addition , possibility place implant graft site evaluate six month healing . For purpose 40 subject 2 fresh adjacent extraction site need two implant replace teeth enrol . Ridge dimensional change measure 6 month heal ; marginal bone loss measure 3-years follow-up baseline ( prosthetic delivery ) .</detailed_description>
