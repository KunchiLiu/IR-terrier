	<detailed_description>According O.M.S . Classification , grade 2 glioma pre-cancerous lesion , slowly progressive , infiltrating central nervous system , mainly affect young adult . Surgical excision tumor appropriate care , without chemotherapy radiotherapy . This surgery nevertheless conduct awake condition achieve two conflict goal : get maximum brain tissue infiltrate tumor preserve integrity functional structure . So awake opening skull , patient undergoes series preoperative test ( motor , sensory / language ) , administer speech therapist present operating room . This procedure allow neurosurgeon establish individual functional brain map real time , observation SLP patient 's answer direct electrical stimulation apply cortical sub-cortical . This support base extraordinary plasticity demonstrate brain presence slowly progressive lesion . To ensure patient high achievable load increase understand brain function , include neural base language , glioma grade 2 predominantly localize functional area language . Many study apply highlight cortical organization language , study subcortical beam involve function , especially semantic language processing , far receive less attention . The use electric direct intraoperative stimulation help highlight cortico-subcortical network involve language processing . The new imaging technique allow u good understand functional brain anatomy : Diffusion Tensor view white matter bundle base diffusion water molecule , functional MRI visualize area cortical functional .</detailed_description>
