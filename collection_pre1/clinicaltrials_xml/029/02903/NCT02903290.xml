	<brief_summary>Genetic cerebellar ataxia involve progressive degeneration cerebellum . Their overall prevalence estimate 2-4 case per 100 000 people . These disease manifest static kinetic cerebellar syndrome characterize impaired balance , coordination , ataxic gait . To date , therapy available patient physical therapy essential recommend . The evolution pathology cause degradation walking , increase instability risk fall . In one year , 74 % 93 % patient report fall least . Falls prevention understand mechanism affect stability major issue management patient physiotherapy . The analysis literature , assume exist trio `` fatigue - instability - energy expenditure '' three parameter would influence . To date , data characterize interrelationship evolution time . STUDY OBJECTIVES : The main objective study relationship change energy expenditure change instability walk one year patient cerebellar ataxia gene . The secondary objective study , one year development , relationship fatigue , instability , energy consumption , number fall , severity ataxia quality life . CONDUCT OF THE STUDY : This pilot , multicenter , interventional . The projected duration patient recruitment 12 month total number patient include 15 . The duration participation study 12 month patient . The anticipated duration study 30 month . Development study : Patients include perform two set ( S1 S2 ) test year apart include evaluation ataxia accord Scale assessment rating ataxia ( SARA ) ; measure quality life SF36 ( The Short Form ( 36 ) ) Questionnaire ; quantify severity fatigue perceive FSS questionnaire quantify severity physical tiredness VAS physical activity ; quantify analysis walk walk track GAITRite® ( score calculation FAP GVI ) physical activity ; physical activity like walk treadmill ( measurement maximal voluntary quadriceps manual dynamometer physical activity ensure induction fatigue ) . Patients provide portable device analyze gas exchange FitMateMED® ( COSMED , Rome , Italy ) walk analyzes GAITRite® .</brief_summary>
