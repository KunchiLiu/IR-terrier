	<brief_summary>This study first experience GSK2982772 , receptor-interacting protein-1 ( RIP1 ) kinase inhibitor , subject active ulcerative colitis ( UC ) . The primary objective investigate safety tolerability repeat oral dos GSK2982772 60 mg placebo twice daily 42 day ( Part A ) follow open label GSK298772 60 mg twice daily 42 day ( Part B ) . In addition pharmacokinetics ( PK ) , number experimental clinical endpoint employ obtain information pharmacodynamics ( PD ) , preliminary efficacy subject active UC . Although formal hypothesis test , endpoint enable broad understand mechanism action potential clinical efficacy GSK2982772 UC . Within 30 Days screen visit , subject randomize receive either GSK2982772 60 mg placebo orally twice daily 42 Days ( 6 week ) 2:1 ratio Part A study . Subjects complete Part A study move open label Part B study receive GSK2982772 60 mg twice daily additional 42 Days ( 6 week ) . After open label ( Part B ) treatment period , subject enter Follow-up period last 28 Days ( +/- 3 Days ) post last administration study medication . The total duration participation study approximately 20 Weeks screening last study visit .</brief_summary>
