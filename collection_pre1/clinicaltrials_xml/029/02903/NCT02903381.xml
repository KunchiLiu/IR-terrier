	<brief_summary>This research study evaluate new drug call `` nivolumab '' possible treatment smolder multiple myeloma order prevent postpone development active multiple myeloma . - Patients smolder multiple myeloma symptom risk progress active multiple myeloma . Multiple myeloma cancer plasma cell , important part immune system . Patients active multiple myeloma generally require treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II Trial If Nivolumab , Lenalidomide Dexamethasone High Risk Smoldering Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- This research study Phase II clinical trial , test effectiveness investigational drug ( ) . The investigational drug use research study ; - nivolumab - lenalidomide - dexamethasone . - Preliminary experience suggest combination lenalidomide dexamethasone may prevent postpone smolder multiple myeloma ( SMM ) become active multiple myeloma . The purpose research study determine addition nivolumab may improve rate prevention combination lenalidomide dexamethasone . - `` Investigational '' mean FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve combination nivolumab , lenalidomide dexamethasone treatment regimen . - Lenalidomide immunomodulatory drug derive thalidomide . Lenalidomide work stop blood flow cancer cell signal cancer cell die . The FDA approve lenalidomide treatment many type cancer include multiple myeloma , myelodysplastic syndrome . - Dexamethasone , also FDA approve , type steroid usually combine chemotherapy treatment blood cancer , myeloma leukemia . - Nivolumab approve FDA lung cancer , skin cancer , kidney cancer , Hodgkin lymphoma . It currently evaluate use treatment several type cancer . Nivolumab may kill stop cancer cell grow block signal cell allow immune system fight cancer . This drug human monoclonal antibody , molecule make laboratory design act identically cell immune system .</detailed_description>
