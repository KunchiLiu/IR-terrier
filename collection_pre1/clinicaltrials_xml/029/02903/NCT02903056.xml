	<brief_summary>Introduction : Rett Syndrome neurodevelopmental disease primarily affect girl . Clinically , patient normal six month one half year old , develop progressive severe problem communication , learn , co-ordination neurodevelopment , loss motor skill around age two . At time , stereotype hand movement typically appear . However , improve ability speech eye gaze , repetitive hand movement may decrease year . Background / hypothesisï¼šPreliminary evidence suggest many difference brain structure Rett syndrome normal people include cerebral volume reduction white matter gray matter , cerebral blood flow frontal area , density receptor basal ganglion . In MR image study , decrease parietal lobe gray matter find , several reduction cortical white matter observe DTI . However , visual relate pathway- posterior corona radiata Rett syndrome girl normal increase FA value . The similar result also discover superior longitudinal fasciculus , associate speech , equal control subject patient preserve speech ( phrase sentence ) .Despite , study mention comparison brain microstructure different stage , especially adult patient . Therefore , prospective study plan figure specific change pattern brain structure different stage Rett syndrome . And trajectory microstructure brain go accordance functional improvement . The investigator suppose ( 1 ) different microstructural change patient with/without preserved mobility , verbal ability communication skill ; ( 2 ) specific brain microstructures change visual pathway ; ( 3 ) specific change pattern brain microstructure different age Rett syndrome . To acquire specific result , investigator aim apply conventional MRI , diffusion-spectrum imaging , clinical assessment tool like Rett syndrome -related questionnaire , SSI , PDMS-2 six-minute walk test investigate correlation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In study propose use conventional MR imaging , diffusion spectrum imaging ( DSI ) , susceptibility weight imaging ( SWI ) , acquire information brain structure neural tissue volume blood vessel . Conventional MR image 3T MR unit consist sagittal T1-weighted , axial T2 fast spin-echo , thickness transverse section 2.5 mm obtain parallel anterior posterior commissure line . Diffusion spectrum imaging ( DSI ) , specific method detects fiber cross white matter , quantify GFA value investigate tract-specific abnormality growth trajectory correlation clinical feature patient RTT.DSI scan acquire use Siemens Tim Trio 3T scanner NTUH . Diffusion spectrum image data obtain 32 channel head coil follow parameter : TE = 2.98 m , TR = 2000 m , slice per slab=208 , slice thickness = 1.0mm , FoV read = 256mm , voxel size=2.5x2.5x2.5mm . Susceptibility weight image ( SWI ) , facilitate sensitivity deposit hemosiderin , improve recognition cerebral micro bleeds ( CMB ) . Therefore , plan use advance technique gain information multiple cortico-subcortical blood vessel patient . Study subject recruit OPD NTU hospital , age range 2 30 year , 45 diagnose rett patient 45 control . All scan complete NTU hospital . Before enter scanning room , parent patient finish questionnaire physical development Rett syndrome , include gross motor , fine motor skill speech ability . After , DSI data acquire 3T MR unit analysis white matter data DSI studio ( http : //dsi-studio.labsolver.org ) perform whole brain tract detail TBAA reconstruct NTU-DSI-122 template . We process analyze gray matter use FreeSurfer ( http : //freesurfer.net ) volume cerebral micro bleeds SWI data find difference Rett patient control group . In order obtain result reliability validity , Peabody developmental motor scale ( PDMS-2 ) , motor development program apply assess gross motor fine motor skill objectively . PDMS-2 consist 6 subject : reflex , stationary , locomotion , object manipulation , grasp , visual-motor integration use clinical assessment training . Finally , brain structure data compare functional change Rett syndrome patient .</detailed_description>
