	<brief_summary>Controlled exercise training valuable therapeutic addition pharmacological treatment patient chronic heart failure , reduce long-term mortality , prevent cardiac remodel improve functional capacity . Despite mechanism underlie benefit might multifactorial , sustain improvement autonomic balance usually attribute major effect . Nevertheless , eligible subject show response exercise , probably due several difference subpopulation enrol . The investigator hypothesize Heart Rate Variability index could valid tool optimize selection follow-up chronic heart failure patient train</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Value Heart Rate Variability Indexes Predict Outcomes After Exercise Training Chronic Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Forty subject follow University Heart Failure Management Program prospectively include . All patient evaluate randomization 24 week enrollment . The investigator perform detailed anamnesis complete physical examination , Doppler echocardiography , Stress Testing , 6-minute walk test , heart rate variability analysis , quality life test . Patients randomize either train group : performing supervise training program , control group receive usual care . All patient receive optimal pharmacologic treatment include diuretic , angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor angiotensin receptor blocker beta-adrenergic block agent . All patient include train group attend supervised program 3-days/week 24 week ( 68-74 session ) . Physical aerobic training appear impart beneficial change autonomic control patient chronic heart failure parasympathetic sympathetic control hear rate . These effect produce change several Heart Rate Variability indices HF rMSSD relate parasympathetic tone .</detailed_description>
