	<brief_summary>The goal pilot study determine whether significant therapeutic advantage place ITB catheter within cervical , thoracic lumbar region spine . It also goal pilot study determine whether origin spasticity influence effect Lioresal Intrathecal ( baclofen injection ) ITB catheter locate cervical , thoracic lumbar region spine . The investigator propose study impact catheter location reduction spasticity within group patient schedule ITB trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intrathecal Baclofen ( ITB ) Delivery Location Its Effect Spasticity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While ITB therapy commonly recommend treatment severe spasticity due variety disease , location optimal drug ( baclofen ) delivery define control study . Furthermore , cost pharmacological management patient significant , optimal location drug delivery implantable drug pump may significant impact cost burden maintenance refill . It goal pilot study determine whether significant therapeutic advantage place ITB catheter within cervical , thoracic lumbar region spine . It also goal pilot study determine whether origin spasticity influence effect Lioresal Intrathecal ( baclofen injection ) ITB catheter locate cervical , thoracic lumbar region spine . The investigator propose study impact catheter location reduction spasticity within group patient schedule ITB trial . In study impact catheter location among patient spinal versus cerebral origin spasticity , disease origin may also significant impact baclofen dose relative placement catheter . In addition , pharmacokinetic half-life variability intrathecal baclofen poorly understood data limit . In order provide initial data regard CSF baclofen washout , sample spinal fluid obtain prior to- follow IT baclofen administration obtain delayed analysis . The result pharmacological analysis may refine understand quickly baclofen distribute give catheter location , whether affected catheter location disease origin . Since multiple catheter location study within give patient , also afford opportunity sample small amount CSF key anatomical site along spinal axis secondary objective .</detailed_description>
