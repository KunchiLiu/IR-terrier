	<brief_summary>Changes GI microbiota and/or metabolomics link evolve transformation immune system function infection rate experimental SCI animal model . A recent study involve chronic survivor SCI show distinct GI microbiome change comparison healthy control . GI microbial metabolism dietary component causally link various health condition , cardiovascular disease , infection , ongoing concern chronic SCI survivor . It probable alteration GI microbiota establish acutely SCI could subsequently alter medical care impact health outcome people live SCI . This project pilot study describe change GI urinary tract microbiota appear first year SCI . When available , data factor , SCI , may impact change gut microbiome SCI also note , include : - level severity SCI , - time since SCI , - person 's immune profile , - antibiotic regimen individual time since antibiotic administration , - incidence type infection SCI - person 's diet activity SCI</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study 1 - Acute first year SCI : The investigator wish recruit 4 type SCI participant ( ~8 tetraplegic motor complete SCI participant , ~8 tetraplegic motor incomplete SCI , ~8 paraplegic motor complete SCI ~8 paraplegic motor incomplete SCI ) . This total 32 participant . The investigator non-invasively collect small ( &lt; 1 gram ) stool urine ( &lt; 1 ml ) sample people suffer acute SCI admit hospital care treatment injury . The investigator track change microbiota , microbiome metabolome within gastrointestinal ( GI ) tract people acute spinal cord injury ( SCI ) non-invasive collection small stool sample normal bowel routine baseline ( within first week SCI ) . Subsequent sample would obtain non-invasive nature approximately 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 month SCI , part daily ( in-patient home , outpatient ) bowel routine . The stool sample process genomic analysis identify GI bacterial specie change individual 's GI microbiota and/or dysbiosis first year SCI . As SCI increase incidence prevalence urinary tract infection ( UTIs ) , investigator track alteration within microbiota urinary tract ascertain whether link bacterial taxon GI system urinary tract . Study 2 - Chronic : This study attempt recruit ~ 20 chronic SCI participant without recurrent infection ( e.g . UTI , skin systemic ) ascertain whether correlation dysbiotic microbiota presentation recurrent infection . A small stool urine sample obtain home participant subsequently collect genomic analysis person 's routine outpatient clinic visit . All replicate data ( 3 sample per individual 3 different time point - 1 , 6 12 month post baseline visit ) chronic participant would match much possible age , gender , diet , type SCI , time since SCI , activity , differ term recurrent infection antibiotic prescription . The goal would characterize gut microbiota difference two disparate group . The data may guide development future study investigate treatment option . During chronic SCI , many recurrent infection UTIs ; thus , investigator also monitor difference two group microbiota metabolomics urinary tract .</detailed_description>
