	<brief_summary>Cholesteatoma destructive expand pathologic condition consist keratin pearl arise squamous epithelium middle ear and/or mastoid process . Evolution consist destruction ossicle well possible spread base skull brain . Surgical treatment require prevent infectious functional complication . A recurrence surgery occur approximately 10 % patient rarely affect initial site . Surgical treatment care option recurrent cholesteatoma . Various location surgical approach cavity , mastoid , hypotympanum see . Temporal bone CT perform prior surgery added information bone erosion especially ossicules , tegmen tympani , facial nerve canal internal ear . Due high anatomical resolution complex anatomy , temporal bone CT usually display Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) operating room help surgical guidance . Imaging especially use MRI cornerstone diagnosis asymptomatic patient . Since 2006 , non echo planar imaging ( EPI ) Diffusion weight imaging ( DWI ) Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) ( sequence show high accuracy depict recurrent cholesteatoma . If EPI sequence high rate diffeomorphic atefacts whereas non EPI sequence use either HAlf-Fourier acquisition Single-shot Turbo spin-Echo ( HASTE ) Fast-spin-echo demonstrate less magnetic susceptibility artifact . Multimodality fusion NonEPI-DWI-MRI computerized tomography ( CT ) rational promising tool rise performance cholesteatomas delineation . The performance NonEPI-DWI-MRI assess lesion spread volume still unknown need investigation . The aim study ass DWI-MRI/CT fusion feasibility , reproducibility accuracy prior surgery propectively compare surgical finding .</brief_summary>
