	<brief_summary>The median age onset chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) chronic phase PC 60 year . However CML affect age group include 18-25 year old , call adult-young adolescent ( AJA ) . In France , record CML especially particular population , European Register CML child 18 year set coordination Professor `` Frederic Millot '' , pediatrics , CHU Poitiers . Malignancies diagnose population usually characteristic , evolution , therapeutic strategy tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKIs ) real therapeutic revolution overall survival significantly augment present minority patient may one day consider final judgment treatment . AJA expose patient complication , socio-economic repercussion , professional personal long-term treatment . But little data literature concern population . Two study show diagnosis CML present poor prognostic factor ( high skoal ) , observed response poorer compare old patient accompany difference survival case decline 70 mois . However , study focus solely patient include study receive optimize treatment standard treatment time . It clearly demonstrate inclusion study bring benefit patient . However , majority AJA include study . The investigator therefore want describe AYA population CML France compare evolution patient include protocol . The investigator also want investigate specific issue age patient reproductive desire . Indeed , seem risk teratogenicity men treat ITK , risk clearly establish woman require specific support . Another important point quality life . The state physical mental health feeling , physical activity limitation well-being assessed SF-3612 questionnaire . The result analysis compare already obtain general population ( representative Italian adult cancer sample ) adjust sex , age , geographic region , marital status education level . There seem young people woman express feel pejorative . This cover frequency side effect also physical activity well-being . affected population note particularly involve social , professional development personal life . The impact treatment quality life must consider penalty see difficulty compliance . But several study demonstrate negative impact poor adherence response treatment .</brief_summary>
