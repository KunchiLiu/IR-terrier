	<brief_summary>Bone erosion common manifestation feature structural damage severe/chronic tophaceous gout . Management destructive often debilitate gout complication focus exclusively urate-lowering therapy ( ULT ) reduce frequency gout attack , little attention give prevention reversal gout relate bone erosion structural damage bone cause gout . Since know effective treatment attenuate improve structural damage cause gout , propose pilot , control , proof-of-concept study denosumab , FDA approve medication treatment bone loss , add standard ULT 20 patient erosive gout .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A recently publish clinical trial zoledronic acid fail show effect improve bone erosion among individual chronic tophaceous gout , despite improvement bone mineral density ( BMD ) bone turnover marker . However , know increased number osteoclast ( cell absorb bone tissue growth heal ) patient tophaceous gout likely result enhance osteoclast activity patient also higher circulate level protein receptor activator nuclear factor kappa-B ligand ( RANKL ) . RANKL identify affect immune system control bone regeneration remodel . Furthermore , peripheral blood cell synovial fluid cell take patient erosive gout preferentially form osteoclast-like cell presence RANKL . The number osteoclasts form significantly correlate number tophus gout patient . Denosumab ( Prolia® ) fully human monoclonal antibody high affinity RANKL bind neutralize activity human RANKL . Given relevance RANKL mechanism gouty erosion , central hypothesis pilot study denosumab likely precisely target RANKL mechanism gouty erosion zoledronic acid .</detailed_description>
