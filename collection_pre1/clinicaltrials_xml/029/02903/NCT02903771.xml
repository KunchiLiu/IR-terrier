	<brief_title>Phase I Study Cantrixil Patients With Ovarian Cancer , Fallopian Tube Cancer Primary Peritoneal Cancer .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study progressive design 3 discrete Parts ( Part A : Dose escalation , Part B : Dose expansion , Part C : Intensive administration dose tolerance ) . Cycle 1/Part A dose-finding assessment ( dose escalation ) establish MTD Cantrixil administer single dose week 3 week . Cycle2/Part A continue 3 additional weekly dos Cantrixil monotherapy assessment disease response . In Cycles 3 8/Part A , patient administer weekly dose Cantrixil tolerate Cycles 1 2 ( tolerance define dose limit toxicity [ DLTs ] unacceptable treatment-related adverse event [ AEs ] ) combination limited range standard chemotherapy agent ( ) , order ass safety tolerability Cantrixil combination therapy . Standard chemotherapy drug administer standard efficacious dos maintain optimum benefit know drug combination patient . Once MTD determine Part A , additional 12 patient recruited expansion cohort Part B . These patient receive 2 cycle Cantrixil monotherapy MTD , follow 6 cycle combination therapy . Once Part B complete , Part C initiate . Part C examine tolerability twice weekly dos Cantrixil MTD 1 dose level monotherapy combination standard chemotherapy . Patients enrol respective part study may receive treatment different part protocol . To accommodate intraperitoneal administration Cantrixil , in-dwelling , close catheter port insert patient already one . For intraperitoneal port , minimum period port placement first administration Cantrixil must shorter 7 day . Patients begin protocol treatment within maximum 28 day enrolment ( i.e. , sign consent form ) . Patients start Dose Level 0 calculate human equivalent 10 % STD10 dose rat ( dose 1/10 severely toxic dose 10 % rat test ) . Dose level -1 -2 activate 2 DLTs Dose Level 0 -1 , respectively . Single patient cohort treat increase dos Cantrixil AE observe meet definition Dose Limiting Toxicity ( DLT ) , opinion Data Safety Monitoring Committee ( DSMC ) Investigator , causally relate study treatment warrant observe additional patient dose level ; point study revert 3+3 rule base dose escalation study . Once study enters 3+3 rules-based design , study revert back single patient cohort . If unacceptable treatment-related AE DLT observe cycle , patient may dose reduce next low dose level Cantrixil subsequent dos therapy . If second unacceptable treatment-related AE DLT observe cycle within patient , treatment patient Cantrixil discontinue . Investigators may continue standard chemotherapy discretion consider safe patient 's best interest . If follow unacceptable treatment-related AEs DLTs observe unless clearly unrelated study treatment ( e.g. , disease progression ) , treatment allocate Cantrixil dose discontinue dose escalation may consider : - Hematologic toxicity - Grade 4 neutropenia , last least 5 day , - Grade 3 Grade 4 neutropenia associate fever &gt; 38.5°C , - Grade 4 thrombocytopenia last least 5 day , - Grade 3 thrombocytopenia associate severe bleed opinion Investigator , - Dose delay ≥3 week due failure recover count . - Any Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCCTCAE ) version 4.03 Grade 3 Grade 4 non haematological toxicity except : - Alopecia - Grade 3 abdominal pain deem related port catheter determine treat physician - Grade 3 anorexia - Grade 3 fatigue - Grade 3 nausea and/or vomiting , diarrhoea , last ≤48 hour without maximal medical management . - Grade 3 dehydration result nausea vomit - Grade 3 constipation - Grade 3 metabolic abnormality [ hypokalaemia , hypomagnesemia , hypocalcaemia , hypophosphatemia ] ) recovers Grade 1 less within 48 hour without medical management o• Other serious adverse event ( SAEs ) , opinion treat Investigator , related investigational product necessitate temporary permanent cessation administration o• Treatment delay ≥3 week due treatment-related non-haematological toxicity constitute DLT All patient discontinue study ( i.e . Off Therapy/ End Therapy ) treatment progress follow-up unless patient withdraws consent . The initiation new cycle Cantrixil discretion Investigator depend potential measurable benefit patient assume continued tolerability adequate organ function . Cantrixil treatment stop due RECIST version 1.1 defined disease progression observe least 4 cycle therapy , recurrence unacceptable toxicity 1 Cantrixil dose reduction patient consent withdrawal . Note patient progressive disease end 2 cycle Cantrixil monotherapy take therapy Cantrixil well tolerate . Pre-clinical data would suggest maximum benefit Cantrixil realise combination therapy , hence patient opportunity continue receive Cantrixil combination therapy . Additionally , patient receive combination therapy observe progressive disease identify RECIST version 1.1 criterion , opinion Investigator , continue derive clinical benefit may continue Cantrixil treatment . Patients may also discontinue study treatment Investigator consider continue therapy patient 's best interest . All patient discontinue study treatment progress follow-up unless patient withdraws consent . Tumour assessment via radiological imaging conduct screen every 6 week start therapy , i.e . end monotherapy every 2 cycle combination therapy . Either contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) contrast-enhanced compute tomography ( CT ) may use , modality use baseline must use consistently patient throughout participation study . Other image mandatory , may perform clinically indicate . Adverse event monitor duration study time inform consent . Blood sample collect weekly standard safety testing , frequently clinically relevant , study . Additional volume blood collect administration Cantrixil PK analysis ( 4 mL per time point per propose PK schedule exploratory study ( baseline , end Cycle 2 end treatment , 15 20 mL time-point ) .</detailed_description>
