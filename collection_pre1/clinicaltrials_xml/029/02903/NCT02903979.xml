	<brief_summary>In front lack evidence determine best treatment deep cavitated carious lesion , search effective restorative technique , result least possible discomfort patient , reduce time need restorative treatment , become relevant . The objective randomized clinical trial evaluate efficacy high viscosity glass ionomer cement restoration ( HVGIC ) compare indirect pulp cap calcium hydroxide cement associate high viscosity glass ionomer cement ( HVGIC ) treatment deep lesion primary molar , well impact treatment quality life , cost procedure , perception parent / carers , patient operator , satisfaction technique evaluate . Children 4 8 year select randomly Clinic Children University Ibirapuera Dentistry . 166 teeth randomize two group : ( 1 ) indirect pulp capping perform calcium hydroxide cement , follow restoration HVGIC ( 2 ) HVGIC restoration . The restoration evaluate 6 , 12 24 month two trained examiner blind treatment . The efficacy treatment measure four main outcome , : ( 1 ) criterion related effectiveness restorative treatment HVGIC compare indirect pulp cap calcium hydroxide cement , ( 2 ) criterion focus patient , ( 3 ) cost-effectiveness , ( 4 ) perception parent operator treatment . For comparison two group use Kaplan-Meier survival long-rank test . Cox regression perform assessment influence variable result . For analyzes , significance level set 5 % .</brief_summary>
