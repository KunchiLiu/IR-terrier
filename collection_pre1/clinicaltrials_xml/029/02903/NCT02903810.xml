	<brief_summary>Clinical study CD19 CAR-T treatment blood lymphatic system tumor achieve breakthrough . The main solution clinical research use CD19 CAR-T infusion alone . Because heterogeneity tumor , patient often carry tumor cell CD19 deficient positive target antigen ( CD22 ) . Specifically removal CD19 positive tumor cell CAR-T treatment , CD19 negative tumor cell tumor cell carry target antigen would amplify extra free space release time , result relapse tumor heterogeneity . In order effectively control recurrence , CAR-T treatment scheme specific several target antigen present verified . However treatment sequential infusion different target specific CAR-T cell , window period two time infusion may opportunity tumor recurrence heterogeneity ; bispecific CAR-T also report one CAR fully function . In order avoid problem , topic put forward first time international treatment scheme equal amount infusion CD19-41BB CD22-41BB two Car-T treatment refractory hematologic malignancy . We expect treatment effective eliminate tumor burden , also inhibit recurrence tumor heterogeneity time .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To determine : Primary Outcome Measure : - Safety ( incidence adverse event define dose-limited toxicity ) Secondary Outcome Measures : - Survival CAR T cell circulation measure flow cytometry qPCR - Overall complete remission rate - Tissue infiltration transfer CAR-T cell - In vitro kill potential infiltrated CAR-T cell - Phenotype infuse CAR-T cell</detailed_description>
