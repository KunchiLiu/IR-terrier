	<brief_summary>To test efficacy melatonin compare placebo prevent post-operative delirium reduction intensity duration delirium individual 65 year age old undergo orthopedic surgery low energy lower extremity fracture ( LELEF ) . Biomarkers may play important role detection , prediction management delirium especially frail elderly individual . Predictive biomarkers may help characterize individual 's susceptibility delirium thereby help specialized treatment , care management individual hospitalization . They may also help predict treatment response specific modality help selection modality . Recent study perform UK publish 2011 measure plasma cholinesterase activity determine level low patient develop delirium compare remain subject . Other study indicate CRP may also role delirium prediction find CRP measure admission ICU predictable change occur within 24 hour turn predictor delirium . One aim study compare predictive treatment response value group biomarkers hypothesize predictive value .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Melatonin Prevention Post- Operative Delirium Pilot Study Protocol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Surgery cause oxidative stress brain9 lead inflammation . Post-operative delirium link inflammation brain . Delirium hypothesized central nervous system response systemic inflammation state blood-brain barrier ( BBB ) compromise . Studies show rise inflammatory cytokine fall anti-inflammatory cytokine . Vice-versa , external cytokine administration show lead delirium . Melatonin know strong anti-oxidant anti-inflammatory property , account preventive property post-operative delirium . It also hypothesize post-operative delirium elderly cause circadian rhythm disturbance secondary relative lack melatonin . Keeping mind two possible pathophysiology delirium , investigator expect melatonin supplementation able reduce incidence post-operative delirium particularly elderly population .</detailed_description>
