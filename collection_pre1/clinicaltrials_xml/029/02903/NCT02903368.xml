	<brief_summary>This research study study combination drug call abiraterone acetate ARN-509 possible treatment new diagnosed Prostate Cancer . The following intervention use study : - Abiraterone Acetate - Prednisone - ARN-509 - Leuprolide Acetate</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant And Adjuvant Abiraterone Acetate + Apalutamide Prostate Cancer Undergoing Prostatectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study Phase II clinical trial . Phase II clinical trial test safety effectiveness investigational intervention learn whether intervention work treat specific disease . `` Investigational '' mean intervention study . The FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve Abiraterone acetate prednisone treatment option prostate cancer spread part body ( metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer ) .However , study investigate treatment localized prostate cancer prior surgical removal prostate ( prostatectomy ) . Abiraterone acetate work decrease production androgen ( male sex hormone ) , promote prostate cancer growth . Some steroid produce adrenal gland turn testosterone , prostate cancer cell fee testosterone . Testosterone suppressed FDA approve drug call leuprolide Lupron . The FDA approve ARN-509 treatment disease . In study , ARN-509 investigate treatment prostate cancer . ARN-509 also work block effect male sex hormone . In research study , investigator study effectiveness one combination drug ( abiraterone acetate + prednisone + leuprolide ) compare another combination drug ( abiraterone acetate + prednisone + leuprolide + ARN-509 ) surgery see improve surgical outcome reduce eliminate Prostate Cancer .</detailed_description>
