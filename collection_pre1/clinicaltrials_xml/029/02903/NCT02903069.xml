	<brief_title>Study Marizomib With Temozolomide Radiotherapy Patients With Newly Diagnosed Brain Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gliomas account ~80 % primary malignant tumor Central Nervous System ( CNS ) , WHO Grade IV malignant glioma ( G4 MG ; include glioblastoma gliosarcoma ) constitute majority glioma , essentially incurable . Currently surgical resection radiotherapy ( RT ) concomitant adjuvant temozolomide ( TMZ ) standard-of-care treatment strategy newly diagnose G4 MG . However , resistance chemotherapy RT result high recurrence rate , median survival ~15-16 month . Since survival advantage demonstrate addition bevacizumab ( BEV ) TMZ RT ( Chinot 2014 ) newly diagnose G4 MG , alternative promising investigational agent need test . Targeting proteasome well-validated target treatment multiple myeloma ( MM ) , preclinical evidence suggest target proteasome glioma cell show significant anti-tumor activity . Proteasome activity elevate patient-derived glioblastoma ( GBM ) tissue comparison normal human brain . Importantly , preclinical evidence demonstrate proteasome inhibition sensitize GBM cell line irradiation TMZ . Further , combination bortezomib ( BTZ , one three proteasome inhibitor [ PI ] currently approve treatment MM ) TMZ result synergistic glioblastoma cell death vitro , BTZ reduce glioma cell survival vitro cell line sensitive resistant TMZ . Despite activity GBM cell vitro , BTZ cross blood brain barrier , thus proven ineffective animal model clinic . In contrast , marizomib ( MRZ ) - potent irreversible 20S PI currently evaluate combination pomalidomide ( POM ) dexamethasone ( DEX ) relapse refractory myeloma - posse unique attribute among PIs cross blood brain barrier . These data prompt examination combination MRZ BEV ongoing clinical trial patient recurrent G4 MG . In dose-escalation portion ongoing study ( MRZ-108 ) , 12 patient dosed MRZ weekly 3 week ( 0.55 , 0.7 , 0.8 mg/m2 infuse intravenously ( IV ) 10 minute ) BEV week 1 3 ( 10 mg/kg IV ) 28-day cycle . As April 2016 , 12 patient , 7 study 4 month - 5 partial response ( include 2 patient radiologic evidence tumor 2 consecutive MRI scan ) 2 patient whose best response stable disease . Four 12 patient treat 6 month , 3 remain study . The recommended Phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) MRZ determine 0.8 mg/m2 . Currently , expansion cohort 24 patient enrol Phase 2 portion study . The next phase involve treatment MRZ alone ( BEV ) patient recurrent G4 MG , begin enrol patient second quarter 2016 . Together , demonstrate activity PIs preclinical glioma model , synergistic activity PIs TMZ glioblastoma cell , along ability MRZ access CNS , provide compelling rationale ass therapeutic benefit combination MRZ TMZ patient G4 MG , brain-penetrant option proteasome inhibition currently available .</detailed_description>
