	<brief_title>The Effect Phrenic Nerve Block Postoperative Shoulder Pain Patients Liver Resection .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Patients undergo laparoscopic open hepatic surgery often experience shoulder pain postoperative period , mostly right side . The mechanism behind referral pain surgical site ipsilateral ( side ) shoulder fully understood . It state , share cervical sensory root , lead brain interpretation pain originate ipsilateral shoulder , phrenic nerve stimulate . The phrenic nerve provide sensory motor nerve diaphragm , sensory fiber part pleura peritoneum . Furthermore , one anatomical study indicate , phrenic nerve right side supply liver capsule thin sensory nerve . This could also , part , explain shoulder pain liver surgery . Studies assess effect phrenic block shoulder pain surgically apply intrathoracic block phrenic nerve , find pain reduction , without significant side effect . There available study effect phrenic nerve block hepatic surgery . Blocking nerve intraoperatively , describe thoracic surgery , possible operation . Pilot study incidence : A recent survey Rigshospitalet , Denmark , reveal , 19 60 patient undergo various type hepatic surgery , experience moderate severe right side shoulder pain post operative care unit . The semi-effective treatment , opioids ( morphine ) , often leading significant side effect ( nausea , vomit , dizziness ) potential increase postoperative morbidity . Furthermore , refer shoulder pain affect respiratory capacity postoperatively . The investigator develop method apply ultrasound-guided block lateral side neck , directly phrenic nerve cross scaleni anterior muscle . The block do low volume local anesthetic ( 3 ml close nerve ) aim avoid affection brachial plexus . The phrenic nerve block perform right side shoulder pain postoperative care unit mark effect within minute ( small nerve little perineural insulation ) . Trial endpoint : The idea study perform precise , low volume , ultrasound guide nerve block patient experience severe right side shoulder pain ( NRS &gt; 5 0-10 scale ) liver surgery evaluate effect active substance vs. placebo Furthermore investigator wish stablish evaluation duration phrenic nerve block come pain intensity , incidence refer shoulder pain liver surgery , need opioid evaluate effect block lung function . The study result describe primary publication regard primary outcome , secondary publication regard incidence acute respiratory ventilatory affection observe PACU patient undergo open liver resection .</detailed_description>
