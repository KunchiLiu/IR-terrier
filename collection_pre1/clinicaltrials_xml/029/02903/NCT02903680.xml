	<brief_summary>Background : Headaches one common complaint child ED treatment pediatric migraine largely base extrapolation data adult study , limited pediatric trial , clinical experience expert consensus . Despite fact dexamethasone already proven effective reduce recurrence currently use treat adult migraine , study look use treatment childhood migraine relapse rate 50 % describe 48h follow successful treatment ED . Objective : To examine effectiveness parenteral dexamethasone prevent migraine recurrence child study risk factor migraine relapse discharge ED . Methods : This randomise , double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical trial among child 8 17 year age presumptive diagnosis acute migraine treat standardized protocol ED CHU Ste-Justine , tertiary care pediatric hospital . After parenteral administration prochlorperazine metoclopramide diphenhydramine , patient randomise receive either dexamethasone placebo . They exclude intervention know allergy absolute contraindication receive parenteral corticosteroid , already corticosteroid regimen respond initial abortive migraine therapy . All include patient discharge 48-hour course naproxen headache diary fill return . The primary outcome incidence relapse 24-48h follow discharge ED . The secondary outcome evaluate mean level pain , use rescue medication ED discharge , return rate ED visit health care professional within 7 day include hospitalisation . The associated symptom , adverse event parenteral corticosteroid risk factor migraine relapse also evaluate . A telephone follow-up make ensure headache diary complete return .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study design This randomise , double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical trial among child presumptive diagnosis acute migraine ED . The study approve institutional IRB write informed assent consent obtain patient parent respectively , prior enrolment . Study set All patient treat ED CHU Ste-Justine , tertiary care pediatric hospital approximately 70 000 visit annually . For 10 year , member ED use standardize protocol treatment migraine . ( 7 ) This protocol suggest administration prochlorperazine diphenhydramine , decrease rate akathisia , patient 8 year age present severe migraine ( unable perform normal activity ) status migrainosus ( migraine last 72 hour ) follow day-course naproxen . Unfortunately , shortage prochlorperazine moment study , decision make use metoclopramide instead , another dopamine ( D2 ) receptor antagonist know effective treatment migraine adult . ( 15 ) To minimize impact research clinical management patient , decide migraine would treat accord standardized local protocol depend availability prochlorperazine . This mean treat physician use prochlorperazine protocol possible metoclopramide . This accounted randomization insure balance distribution group . While use dual intervention decrease homogeneity participant , improve drastically external validity . Participants Inclusion criterion Patients eligible 8 17 year age present diagnosis acute migraine require treatment intravenous rescue therapy ( either metoclopramide prochlorperazine ) severity migraine accord treat physician . In prior study , group pediatric emergency physician migraine diagnosis confirm pediatric neurologist 64 68 patient . ( 16 ) Exclusion criterion Patients exclude know allergy study drug component absolute contraindication receive corticosteroid : active untreated infection , systemic fungal infection , cerebral malaria , respiratory tuberculosis , hypertension , heart failure , renal hepatic impairment , GI diseases , myasthenia gravis , diabetes , cataract , glaucoma , seizure disorder , thyroid dysfunction , thromboembolic tendency . Also , patient already corticosteroid eligible . Finally , patient initially recruit respond abortive migraine therapy ( modification pain level ) randomize receive intervention placebo . Information patient keep included primary analysis . Intervention/procedure As mention , participant receive standardized treatment consist metoclopramide ( 0.5 mg/kg IV , maximum 10 mg , q 1h prn , maximum 3 dos ) prochlorperazine ( 0.15 mg/kg IV 2-3 minute , maximum 10 mg ) diphenhydramine ( 0.5 mg/kg IV , maximum 25 mg ) . The intervention interest administration dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg IV ( max 24 mg ) departure ED . The control group receive similar look placebo ( NaCl 0,9 % IV ) volume . All patient receive perfusion D5 % NaCl 0.9 % basal requirement stay ED discharge 48-hour course naproxen ( NaprosynÂ® 5 mg/kg/dose BID , max 500 mg ) provide pharmacy . Primary Outcome The primary outcome incidence relapse follow discharge ED 48 hour metoclopramide prochlorperazine initial administration . Relapse define either occurrence headache pain , regardless severity , pain free status , increase pain intensity participant leave ED residual pain . Secondary outcome The secondary outcome mean level pain use VAS 24 48 hour follow initial administration metoclopramide prochlorperazine , use rescue medication ED discharge , return rate ED , visit health care professional within 7 day include hospitalization . Also , associate symptom ( i.e . nausea , vomit , photophobia sonophobia ) , adverse event parenteral corticosteroid ( heartburn , constipation , personality change irritability , sleep problem ) follow risk factor migraine relapse evaluate : headache duration , past history headache , presence familial history migraine , age , sex , rescue medication home prior ED visit , prophylaxis home prior ED visit , past history neurology consultation , past history CT scan , maximal pain intensity , pain intensity arrival ED discharge , duration sleep ED , quality sleep ED , treatment ED , treatment discharge , compliance medication discharge , time return school , time return normal activity , number hour sleep discharge ED , quality sleep home ED discharge . Study protocol All eligible child treat physician prescribe migraine protocol study set invite participate study administration first medication ( either metoclopramide prochlorperazine ) . Baseline demographic data , vital sign , characteristic duration headache record standard data form . Patients ask complete standardized questionnaire ED stay help parent need . At time 0 , prior treatment , patient rat headache severity 100 mm visual analogue scale ( VAS ) , 0 10 verbal numeric scale ( VNS ) 4-point verbal numeric scale ( VNS ) 0=no headache , 1=mild headache , 2=moderate headache 3=severe headache . The participant also ask rate headache 4-point functional disability scale 0=no disability ( i.e . able function normally ) ; 1=mild disability ( i.e . able perform activity daily live difficulty ) ; 2= moderate disability ( i.e . unable perform certain activity daily live ) ; 3= severe disability ( i.e . unable perform activity daily live , require bed rest ) . The participant receive standard abortive migraine therapy previously detail . Patients rat headache severity three scale previously mention 2 hour abortive medication give soon woke ( fell asleep ) ask report associate symptom ( i.e . nausea , vomit , photophobia sonophobia ) adverse effect ( severity , seriousness , time onset resolution ) . The assessment repeat discharge . Patients discharge accord clinical decision ED physician . In uncommon situation participant hospitalize respond adequately abortive intervention , patient exclude study offer intervention . The rationale behind procedure dexamethasone give decrease migraine recurrence could effective migraine regress . Just discharge removal intravenous access , research nurse take next available study package accord status patient ( absence presence residual pain discharge abortive medication use ) administer intervention , either study drug placebo . All patient discharge 48-hour course naproxen provide pharmacy facilitate compliance dosage 5 mg/kg twice day 48 hour . The participant also give headache diary fill stamp envelop standardized questionnaire use research assistant follow case phone interview would happen . The participant instruct answer question diary day first 48 hour discharge day 4 7 return diary stamp envelop . To facilitate compliance headache diary , patient contact telephone 24-48 hour one week later remind complete return diary also ask question research assistant phone . Randomization blind The hospital pharmacist create randomization table use computer generate sequence use block randomization variable size . Stratification perform accord absence presence pain discharge also depend abortive medication use ( prochlorperazine metochlopramide ) . The pharmacist cod study medication advance . Either dexamethasone ( 10 mg/mL ) normal saline ( placebo ) place respective syringe label code number . Once consent study enrolment obtain , next consecutive study package use . Blinding assure dexamethasone placebo appearance administer volume . Compliance quality control Because intervention limit single dose intravenous medication , compliance almost perfect . However , ensure dose effectively give participant accord chart . Several precaution take order minimize potential bias . A screen log maintain record number patient screen , exclude , miss , randomize reason . The diagnosis reason exclusion ( ineligible refuse patient ) record order help u detect selection bias . We also implement number study manoeuvre aim minimize measurement bias , include ( ) designation research pharmacist ( team member ) prepare medication accord randomization list , ( b ) documenting use major co-intervention , use analgesia . Statistical analysis All data enter Excel database ( Microsoft Inc. , Richmond , WA ) analyze SPSS v17 software ( SPSS Inc. , Chicago , Illinois ) . To assess balance across arm , baseline demographic ( i.e . gender , age ) clinical data patient compare arm . In unlikely event substantial imbalance find , additional analysis , addition one propose , carry assess potential confounding effect imbalance . The primary analysis perform among study participant receive study medication use intention-to-treat principle . This comparison proportion relapse 48 hour follow intervention 2 group use chi-square analysis . A secondary analysis compare relapse proportion one week . Another secondary analysis use student t-test compare mean VAS pain 24 hour , 48 hour 7 day follow intervention . Finally , use rescue medication , unplanned visit healthcare set side effect compare use chi-square statistic . Sample size requirement A previous study do pediatric emergency department report approximately 50 % child successfully treat migraine study set relapse follow 48 hour . ( 7 ) Based , minimal clinically significant difference define a-priori group pediatric emergency physician decrease relapse rate 25 % . Assuming number , total 58 patient require group power 0.80 alpha 0.05 .</detailed_description>
