	<brief_title>Prostate Cancer Intensive , Non-Cross Reactive Therapy ( PRINT ) Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer ( CRPC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase II clinical trial explore efficacy rapidly cycle non-cross reactive treatment therapy treatment patient newly diagnose mCRPC . The primary hypothesis best chance eliminate control disease cancer treatment naïve , yet develop therapeutic resistance . By find optimal drug deployment strategy already approve available treatment mCRPC , researcher believe provider effectively treat intrinsically heterogeneous disease , delay/prevent drug resistance , well minimize treatment toxicity . All treatment agent select well-defined individual toxicity profile large phase III trial , limited clinical data toxicity profile drug combination . While agent generally well tolerate , toxicity remain significant concern give old age typical mCRPC patient , comorbid condition common patient population , well borne previous chronic androgen deprivation therapy . Each drug propose treatment regimen use FDA-approved dose indication , exception cabazitaxel , use prior disease demonstration docetaxel failure , combination carboplatin . The propose sequencing rationally design , base drug 's distinct mechanism action well toxicity profile . The rapidly-cycling treatment regimen contain three , separate , consecutive treatment module , last 3 month : 1 . Abiraterone + Radium-223 ; 2 . Cabazitaxel + Carboplatin ; 3 . Enzalutamide + Radium-223 . Therapeutic agent deliver non-cross reactive combination , order achieve optimal therapeutic dosing cycle decrease possibility significant adverse effect . To researcher knowledge , study evaluate use rapidly cycle , non-cross reactive therapy treatment mCRPC . The hypothesis identification optimal combination sequence rapidly cycle non-cross reactive therapy help prevent delay development therapeutic drug resistance , safely tolerate . Primary objective evaluate time disease progression completion modules rapidly-cycling , non-cross reactive regimen patient mCRPC . Secondary objective evaluate overall survival , prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) response rate treatment module , change alkaline phosphatase level , assess safety rapidly-cycling , non-cross reactive regimen . Additional exploratory objective evaluate correlation peripheral whole-blood RNA signature clinical outcome measure treatment , evaluate change AR-V7 expression CTCs different treatment modality clinical outcome .</detailed_description>
