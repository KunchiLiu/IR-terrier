	<brief_title>PREgnancy-associated Pelvic Floor Health Knowledge And REDuction Symptoms : The PREPARED Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose : The purpose study determine single class pelvic floor health administer pregnancy increase primiparous woman 's knowledge pelvic floor health , decrease pelvic floor symptom postpartum , increase practice pelvic floor muscle exercise , increase satisfaction delivery experience , change preference thought surround various mode delivery . There currently workshops provided St. Paul 's Hospital Vancouver BC . Hypothesis Aim : A single 2 hour workshop pelvic floor health administer pregnancy improve primiparous woman 's knowledge pelvic floor health 6 week postpartum compare control group participate workshop . Justification Study ( Background ) : The pelvic floor compose muscle connective tissue act provide support pelvic organ . Weakness injury pelvic floor result pelvic floor dysfunction . This include condition pelvic organ prolapse , urinary incontinence , irritative bladder symptom , fecal incontinence , pelvic pain sexual dysfunction . Maintenance pelvic floor health important disease pelvic floor bothersome , disfigure significantly affect quality life woman . Though prevalence pelvic floor problem increase age , also affect woman childbearing age , especially pregnancy . According Brown et al. , prevalence urinary incontinence 12 month pregnancy 10.8 % increase 55.9 % third trimester . At three month postpartum , 30 % woman continue urinary incontinence . Parity strongly associate pelvic floor dysfunction later life . According Rortveit et al , risk pelvic organ prolapse significantly increase woman 1 ( OR 2.8 , 95 % CI 1.1-7.2 ) , 2 ( OR 4.1 , 95 % CI 1.8-9.5 ) 3 ( OR 5.3 , 95 % CI 2.3-12.3 ) vaginal delivery compare nulliparous woman . Also , forceps delivery associate increase pelvic floor symptom 5-10 year delivery , especially overactive bladder ( OR 2.92 , 95 % CI 1.44-5.93 ) prolapse ( OR 1.95 , 95 % CI 1.03-3.70 ) . Research pelvic floor health education principal investigator show improvement pelvic floor health knowledge , also improvement pelvic floor symptom quality life 3 month single workshop . However , introduction pelvic floor health workshop would ideal pregnant population , captive audience . This time employ intervention improve health , smoke cessation , vitamin supplementation , healthy eat etc . Also , woman childbearing age millennial generation . They interest health place great value quality life compare previous generation . Thus group motivate individual would implement change improve future quality life give appropriate information encourage change . Despite current evidence demonstrate single important risk factor disruption pelvic floor health childbirth , pregnant woman ill-informed pelvic floor health . A survey health professional Swansea , UK , reveal pelvic floor muscle exercise pelvic floor health receive low priority comparison antenatal topic discuss obstetric care provider patient . What perhaps even astound find 15 % respondent , include obstetrician , midwife family physician , unable describe pelvic floor exercise , health professional survey felt received adequate training pelvic floor health . Canada currently recommendations patient education regard pelvic floor health pregnancy . As demonstrated audit perform Ismail et al. , even region guideline exist , education pregnant woman subject poor . Our current standard practice leave pelvic floor education hand obstetric care provider . A survey health professional UK reveal pelvic floor health receive low priority comparison topic discuss antenatal period . Furthermore , obstetric care provider felt train pelvic floor health inadequate . The investigator research project propose close gap patient knowledge scientific knowledge . There clear evidence childbirth single important risk factor future pelvic floor condition . There also evidence support pelvic floor muscle exercise antepartum postpartum period prevent improve pelvic floor symptom . The investigator workshop empower woman knowledge allow make informed decision surround childbirth . It provide tool improve pelvic floor health . A pelvic floor health workshop antenatal period innovative concept could lead well patient care . It may first step prevention future pelvic floor condition . The target population primiparous woman , 20 year old first pregnancy singleton gestation 100 woman recruit . Sampling method : All participant randomize two group , random allocation list generate statistician unassociated study use SAS programming language . The allocation load onto computer access study coordinator interact web-based ORACLE screen . Interactions coordinator system log , include time date , patient identifier ( patient letter code ) treatment allocation .</detailed_description>
