	<brief_summary>Acute pancreatitis common fear complication ERCP , occur 1 % 30 % procedure . Since 2012 , multicenter RCT publish NEJM , indomethacin use high risk patient consider `` standard '' method prevent PEP . However , risk factor PEP fully clear . Additionally , complication NSAID use lead serious physical problem bleeding . Therefore , exclusive criterion limit NSAID use include allergy， gastrointestinal haemorrhage ，presence coagulopathy receive anticoagulation therapy . Previous study show another natural compound , resveratrol , own similar biological effect NSAID . Firstly , could inhibit inflammatory response vivo model inhibition COX IL-6 etc . Secondly , could influence level platelet coagulation , mean safe NSAID . Thirdly , numerous study show resveratrol could effectively progression severe acute pancreatitis . According data , design project . The purpose study determine whether oral resveratrol pre-ERCP effective control Post-ERCP pancreatitis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oral Resveratrol Prevent Post-ERCP Pancreatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- This prospective , randomise control trial do 8 tertiary referral hospital China . Patients ( age 18-90 year ) native papilla plan diagnostic therapeutic ERCP eligible enrolment study . Exclusion criterion include contraindication ERCP , know pancreatic head mass , previous biliary sphincterotomy without plan contrast injection pancreatic duct , acute pancreatitis within 3 day , ERCP biliary stent removal exchange without anticipated pancreatogram , know active cardiovascular cerebrovascular disease , unwilling inability provide consent , pregnant breastfeed woman . Indications contra- indication ERCP determine endoscopists anaesthesiologists ERCP ; include risk patient health life judge outweigh potential benefit ERCP , know suspect perforated viscus , haemodynamic instability . The risk stratification patient define base criterion use study Elmunzer colleages . Patients consider high risk post-ERCP pancreatitis meet least one major criterion two minor criterion . The risk status patient determine immediately procedure one investigator site mask group allocation . - Randomisation mask - The study coordinator block randomisation ( ten block ) . The randomisation list computer generate , stratify accord individual centre . Patients assign randomly 1:1 ratio , receive ERCP , either universal pre- procedural group risk-stratified post-procedural group . Oral resveratrol Indometacin administer procedure room ERCP one investigator site participate data collection analysis . Endoscopists assistance participate ERCP procedure mask group allocation . Investigators collect demographic procedure-related data participate assessment post-ERCP compli- cation also mask group allocation . Patients mask treatment allocation . - Before start study , post-procedural selective indometacin high-risk patient demonstrate effective prevention post-ERCP pancreatitis . - Outcomes The primary outcome study frequency post-ERCP pancreatitis . The diagnosis post-ERCP pancreatitis establish new onset upper abdominal pain associate elevate serum amylase least three time upper limit normal range 24 h procedure , admission hospital least 2 night . The secondary outcome frequency moderate severe post-ERCP pancreatitis . We define severity pancreatitis accord criterion report Cotton colleague . Other post-ERCP complication ( include bleeding , biliary infection , perforation , adverse outcome require hospital admission prolong hospital stay management ) monitor describe previously.24 Moderate severe bleed define clinically significant bleed decrease haemoglobin concentration least 3 g/L need transfusion , angiographic intervention , surgery . 23 Patients contact 30 day assess late complication ( include delay bleed cardiovascular renal adverse event ) ; final follow-up . An investigator familiar ERCP site mask treatment allocation record procedure-related parameter include cannulation method , number cannulation attempt , inadvertent pancreatic duct cannulation , pancrea- tography , prophylactic placement pancreatic duct stent . The investigator also record patient demographic , post-ERCP adverse event potentially cause procedure study drug , follow-up data . All data subsequently enter web- base database manage independent investigator . We define severity post-ERCP complication accord Cotton criteria:23 mild ( pancreatitis procedure require admission prolongation plan admission 2-3 day ) ; moderate ( pancreatitis procedure require hospitalisation 4-10 day ) ; severe ( pancreatitis procedure require hospitalisation 10 day , haemorrhagic pancreatitis , phlegmon pseudocyst , intervention ) . Detailed definition adverse event provide appendix .</detailed_description>
