	<brief_summary>The investigator conduct study around best way monitor infant hospitalize bronchiolitis , common lung infection lead reason hospitalization infant . Infants bronchiolitis breathe difficulty provide supplemental oxygen oxygen level low . However , uncertainty regard best monitor oxygen level . A probe place hand foot use monitor oxygen level time ( continuous oxygen monitoring ) every 4-6 hour ( intermittent oxygen monitoring ) . Research suggest place infant bronchiolitis continuous monitoring result unnecessary use oxygen infant stay long hospital . However , due lack high quality research , unclear strategy best practice varies . The objective study conduct high quality research across hospital determine whether intermittent compare continuous oxygen monitoring reduce length hospital stay infant hospitalize bronchiolitis . The investigator also compare safety cost . The result study inform bronchiolitis practice standard best use health care resource .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND This research protocol focus bronchiolitis , lead cause infant hospitalization cumulative expense health care system . Supportive management , oxygen supplementation monitoring , major focus care , active medical treatment effective . Oxygen saturation monitoring may perform intermittent ( e.g . every 4-6hrs ) continuous basis stable infant hospitalize bronchiolitis . Observational study find use continuous monitoring associate overuse supplemental oxygen longer hospital stay . Based low quality evidence , practice guideline state clinician may choose use continuous monitoring practice variation exists due lack RCTs . SPECIFIC AIMS Primary : To determine intermittent v continuous oxygen saturation monitoring reduce length hospital stay infant bronchiolitis . Secondary : To determine difference outcomes - effectiveness , safety , acceptability , cost . METHODOLOGY Design : multi-centre , pragmatic , parallel group , 1:1 , two arm superiority RCT . Population : Previously healthy infant ( 4 weeks-2 year ) hospitalize bronchiolitis clinically stable , recruit child 's community hospital Ontario , Canada . Interventions : Randomization intermittent ( every 4hrs ) continuous oxygen saturation monitoring . In keep local national clinical practice guideline , acceptable oxygen saturation target â‰¥ 90 % use group .</detailed_description>
