	<brief_summary>When develop new medication lung disease like Cystic Fibrosis ( CF ) , scientist perform lab experiment use cell airway , physiology study lungs change drug give , clinical study determine drug affect overall health . The investigator study seek develop computer model predict patient respond drug lab study cell sample nose . Such model would allow medication develop rapidly patient allow treatment personalize well . In order develop computer model series test perform patient CF . Tests include sample cell nose measure lung physiology use combination different imaging , breathing , study perform participant take therapy . Similar test perform people CF , parent CF participant carry single CF gene provide information specific gene might affect CF lung disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multilevel Models Therapeutic Response Lungs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal research develop series interconnect model therapeutic response diseased lung , focus primarily Cystic Fibrosis ( CF ) , ultimately provide mean predict vivo response base patient-specific vitro testing , allow optimization personalization therapy . Investigators use human bronchial epithelial ( HBE ) recently human nasal epithelial ( HNE ) cell culture study CF pathophysiology . The investigator perform study also develop functional imaging biomarkers lung provide organ level quantification CF lung physiology ( mucociliary clearance airway liquid absorption ) , , recently , silico system model lung physiology cell organ level . The silico model provide framework differential equation describe basic physiological process interact contribute experimental outcome . Their use allow mechanism specifically differentiate . Here investigator propose link vitro vivo response sample culture HNE cell culture non-CF CF subject also perform series physiological assessment , include functional imaging scan . The silico model facilitate link therapeutic study cell therapeutic outcome patient . 1 . CF PATIENTS perform 2 study day . Study day 1 include : 1. nasal potential difference measurement 2. pulmonary function test 3. inert gas washout test 4. urine pregnancy test 5. nasal cell sample 6. nuclear MCC/ABS scan ( include inhalation isotonic hypertonic saline - randomize order ) 7. blood draw CFTR genotyping already available . Study day 2 include 1. pulmonary function test 2. urine pregnancy test 3. nuclear MCC/ABS scan ( include inhalation isotonic hypertonic saline - randomize order ) 2 . PARENTS OF ENROLLED CF patient choose participate perform 1 study day include : 1. nasal potential difference measurement 2. pulmonary function test 3. inert gas washout test 4. urine pregnancy test 5. nasal cell sample 6. nuclear MCC/ABS scan ( include inhalation isotonic saline ) 7. single blood sample drawn CFTR genotyping . 3 . HEALTHY CONTROLS perform 1 screen 1 study day include : 1. pulmonary function test 2. inert gas washout test 3. urine pregnancy test 4. nasal cell sample 5. nuclear MCC/ABS scan ( include inhalation isotonic saline ) 6. single blood sample drawn CFTR genotyping ( screen ) .</detailed_description>
