	<brief_summary>Concurrent chemoradiotherapy standard treatment locally advance non-small cell lung carcinoma ( NSCLC ) . Different chemotherapy radiation regimen advocate general , cisplatin-doublets deem standard care . Decreasing overall treatment time irradiation hypofractionation think increase efficacy . Extensive experience available combination daily-dose cisplatin combination hypofractionated radiotherapy . However , data available safety cisplatin doublet hypofractionated radiotherapy</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients present locally advanced NSCLC consent participate phase 2 trial evaluates concurrent treatment cisplatin ( Day 1 : 75mg/m2 ) pemetrexed ( Day 1 : 500mg/m2 non-squamous cell lung cancer ) etoposide ( Day1-3 100mg/m2 squamous cell lung cancer ) , 3-weekly regimen , together radiotherapy ( 24 daily fraction 2.42 Gy mediastinal lymph node integrate boost 2.75 Gy primary tumour ) . An interim analysis plan follow first cohort 25 patient assess safety .</detailed_description>
