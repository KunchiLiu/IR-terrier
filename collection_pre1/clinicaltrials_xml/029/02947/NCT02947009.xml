	<brief_summary>Exercise-induced paradoxical vocal fold motion disorder ( E-PVFMD ) - severely impact live 1 million adolescent U.S. annually - under- mis-diagnosed many 80 % case , lead ineffective , protract period management . Additionally , make condition different risk condition ( e.g. , play sports/engaging athletic activity within competitive athletic environment ) unclear . The goal propose study address diagnostic challenge ( 1 ) pursue previously publish preliminary taxonomic algorithm clinical identification classification EPVFMD , ( 2 ) elucidate potential underlying mechanism drive clinical presentation . Study outcomes improve sensitivity specificity diagnosis protocol PVFMD , thereby reduce prevalence misdiagnosis improve clinical management individual disorder future . Outcomes also use create preventative care measure adolescent risk condition .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The experimental protocol consist five stage total ( Stages IV ) : ( 1 ) Screening , ( 2 ) Pre-Baseline , ( 3 ) Baseline Laryngoscopy Condition , ( 4 ) Exercise Laryngoscopy Condition , ( 5 ) Recovery . The following section describe procedure conduct within five stage Stage I : Screening To determine eligibility , consent participant ( 1 ) undergo spirometric screening rule indication pulmonary pathology , ( 2 ) report partake athletic activity within competitive environment ( self-perceived/reported ) , ( 3 ) complete Dyspnea Index ( DI ) . Participants less 80 % predict FEV1 spirometry exclude study refer pediatric pulmonary clinic Massachusetts General Hospital ( MGH ) . Anyone report feel sports-related activity competitive exclude . Participants E-PVFMD group score less 10 40 DI exclude study , whereas participant at-risk group score 6 40 DI exclude study . Stage II : PreBaseline All participant pass screen rate bad severity perceive shortness breath experience screening period , well symptom relate PVFMD ( i.e. , cough , globus , dysphonia , laryngeal pain/tension ) , 0100mm visual analog scale ( VAS ) . These value later serve anchor subsequent symptom rating . Rating severity symptom prior laryngoscopy also prime participant symptom severity rating subsequent condition , describe shortly detail . Next , blood pressure ( SBP ) heart rate ( HR ) reading obtain three time ( x3 ) 30-second interval great 5minute period , use blood heart rate monitor . The three reading average used anchor SBP HR read take subsequent study phase . Two self-reported questionnaire administer enrolled participant : Early Adolescent Temperament Questionnaire - Revised-short form ( EATQ-R-SF ) Paffenbarger Physical Activity Questionnaire ( PPAQ ) . Participants read complete two questionnaire , although PI parent/guardian may clarify question help participant read instruction , especially young participant . Last , respiratory transducer band place ribs 5-8 measure respiratory rate ( RR ) tidal volume ( TV ) . These parameter may use stratify/bin data , posthoc . Stage III : Baseline Laryngoscopy Condition Participants position upright examination chair give decongestant ( e.g. , Afrin® ) one nasal passage . The laryngeal vestibule visualize flexible nasoendoscopy ( laryngoscopy ) use halogen light . Subjects structural dynamic abnormality occlude third airway rule ( exclude , need ) normal laryngeal movement ( i.e. , abduction inspiration slight adduction exhalation ) confirm rest clinician ENT physician . The laryngeal examination record glottic supraglottic laryngeal configuration analyze later offline . The PI watch participant 's thoracic abdominal cavity movement call begin inspiratory ( `` I '' ) expiratory ( `` E '' ) phase participant breathes . The call record laryngeal examination video use identify optimal period within specific phase respiratory cycle extract digital still image larynx . Participants ask remain relaxed possible , instruction relate breathe bring attention respiratory pattern . Three SBP HR reading record second time blood pressure cuff every 30 second 5min period average across three trial . Once endoscope remove , participant ask rate perception bad severity shortness breath experience baseline laryngoscopy condition 0-100mm VAS second time . Stage IV : Exercise Laryngoscopy Condition Participants undergo grade exercise test ( GXT ) cycle ergometer simultaneous flexible laryngoscopy . The exercise challenge parallel procedures previously describe 1minute progressive incremental cycle ergometer protocol , start 50 watt ( 300 kgm/min ) , increments 50 watt every minute . Simultaneous laryngoscopic procedure , well SBP HR recording , generally parallel baseline laryngoscopic protocol Stage III . To minimize risk injury overexertion , explicit instruction exercise protocol give participant prior start protocol . Once participant communicate understanding , sit ergometer seat properly adjust slight bend knee joint ball foot pedal , pedal low position ( ~10-15° angle knee flexion leg extend ) . Once seated position , participant instruct relax grip handlebar prevent peripheral constriction , could confound cardiovascular function . The blood pressure cuff adjust accordingly standard fashion pulse oximeter fit participant 's middle finger dominant hand monitor oxyhemoglobin saturation exercise challenge . Participants train rating perceive level exertion point Borg Perceived Exertion Scale mount board . The Borg scale go 6 20 , 6 represent feeling exertion score 19 represent anaerobic activity sustain minute . Borg severity rating use identify optimal level exertion measure extract video image exercise condition . During task , participant encourage vocalize ask rely solely board communicate perceive level exertion incremental exercise load impose . The goal endeavor avoid movement vocal fold vocalization , may confound respiratory ( non-phonatory ) laryngeal configuration parameter . A head mount place participant 's head head flexible endoscope insert head mount , flexible camera dangle head mount head endoscope . Next , participant remind Borg Scale rating , re-instructed need . For participant potential E-PVFMD , instruction also provide indicate induction PVFMD attack `` thumb '' signal provocation challenge . All participant inform encouraged continue pedal throughout protocol vigorous exercise level reach . Participants also remind protocol voluntary terminate trial time . Once participant communicate understanding willingness continue , flexible camera lens insert nostril , manner baseline laryngoscopy examination . Once laryngeal vestibule identify laryngoscope , flexible camera lens secure ipsilateral nare surgical tape prevent movement scope nose . The graded exercise test ( GXT ) begin 50 watt ( 300 kgm/min ) target increase 300 kgm/min every minute , per standard GXT protocol . Participants ask maintain 50-70 RPM pedal rate ( display ergometer ) incremental increase load . For participant E-PVFMD group , incremental load continue one two event transpires : ( 1 ) E-PVFMD attack occurs ( i.e. , participant experience symptom representative previously experience paroxysmal PVFMD episode , indicate induction episode `` thumbs '' sign ) . Once episode begin , videoendoscopy recording obtain additional 30 second exercise laryngoscopy challenge terminate , point video record also stop . ( 2 ) No signs/symptoms `` attack '' occur 3-minute mark maximum exertion ( 19-20 Borg score ) , challenge terminate . Results latter case bin future analysis beyond scope propose study . However , sans-PVFMD-attack cohort PVFMD group exclude analysis final n=25 present study replace targeted sample size ( n = 25 ) reach . For at-risk group , score 19 Borg scale report , 30 additional second videoendoscopy record task terminate . To terminate protocol group , bike ergometer first reduce 0 watt load laryngoscope remove nasopharynx . During exertion task , SBP HR record one minute mark , right additional incremental increase load , 1-2 time maximum exertion ( Borg scale 19-20 ) within 30-second maximum exercise challenge ( subsequent videoendoscopic record time frame ) . Participants bike maximum 10 minute . Stage V : Recovery The cycle ergometer task stop SBP HR record , time 1-minute , 2-minute , 3-minute post-max exertion time point , determine stopwatch . Participants ask rate bad perceive symptom experience exercise laryngoscopy task third ( final time ) time use 0-100 VAS . HR reading use calculate heart rate recovery ( HRR ) offline data analysis . Participants cycle additional 1-2 min proper cool ensure cardiovascular parameter back baseline help bike .</detailed_description>
