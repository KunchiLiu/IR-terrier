	<brief_summary>Broad Goal : To demonstrate focused vascular ultrasound ( FOVUS ) accurately risk stratify patient chest pain emergency department ( ED ) . Background Rationale : Traditional risk assessment focus characteristic pain , know Coronary Artery Disease ( CAD ) , risk factor , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , blood test identify active ischemia . Identifying clinically significant CAD remain one challenging task ED . Current clinical decision rule err side investigation admission . To address limitation , Investigators develop point-of-care carotid ultrasound test predictive CAD . The Investigators show carotid plaque strongly associate significant angiographic CAD population refer angiogram . Research Aims : Primary - To determine association carotid plaque measure dedicated sonographer 30-day major adverse cardiac event ( MACE ) , include MI , reperfusion , death patient present ED suspect cardiac ischemia . Secondary - To determine agreement sonographer emergency physician FOVUS result . Methodology : The Investigators propose prospective cohort study ass prognostic value novel point-of-care carotid ultrasound plaque quantification protocol ED Kingston General Hospital . We enroll 500 consecutive patient present chief complaint chest pain prompt least one 12-lead ECG troponin measurement . Patients undergo carotid scan dedicate sonographer emergency physician . Patients follow MACE 30 day . Those perform scan blind clinician 's impression care plan clinician blind FOVUS finding . The primary analysis involve determination sensitivity , sensitivity , positive predictive value , negative predictive value likelihood ratio associate FOVUS 30-day MACE . Expected Outcomes : The study provide evidence determine whether FOVUS may useful prognostic tool emergency physician assess patient suspect ischemic chest pain . The secondary analysis provide evidence determine whether emergency physician trained measure carotid plaque height accurately compare gold standard ultrasonographer measurement . Significance : If FOVUS reliably identify low risk patient , implementation novel tool could reduce ED length stay , monitoring , overcrowd .</brief_summary>
