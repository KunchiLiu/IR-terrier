	<brief_title>Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy With Retro-infundibular Approach</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study prospective cohort study , conduct Minia university hospital Minia insurance hospital period July 2013 January 2016 , 597 patient gallstone admit laparoscopic cholecystectomy do surgeon . Based preoperative scoring system predict degree difficulty laparoscopic cholecystectomy , patient score &gt; 6 fit laparoscopic surgery include study . Only 125 meet criterion agree share study give inform consent . 60 patient operate SLC ( Group 1 ) .This include classic dissection Calot 's triangle achieve CVS , separate clipping division cystic duct artery . While , 65 patient operate laparoscopic cholecystectomy use RI approach ( Group 2 ) . This included separation lower third GB bed pedicle ( artery duct ) mass ligation . Operative procedure RI approach : The site trocars standard cholecystectomy . After dissection adhesion mask GB , present , reach Hartmann pouch , point Calot 's triangle usually scar frozen , surgeon never try dissect instead surgeon continue follow : 1 . De-shouldering GB : incising serosal cover either side infundibulum lower part body . 2 . This follow dissection separation lower third GB body bed , use suction-irrigation probe hook dissector . Dissection continue downward till GB pedicle ( duct artery ) . 3 . Mass ligation cystic artery duct , use intracorporeal note vicryl number 1 suture . 4 . Then surgeon cut ligature use diathermy scissor ultrasound seal device . During step cut end GB grasp forceps try prevent spillage content , happen , stone collect bag extract . 5 . Then GB dissect bed usual extract bag . In case GB hugely distend , aspirate firstly facilitate grasping . Also case Mirizzi syndrome GB open direct stone remove , facilitate grasp GB continue describe</detailed_description>
