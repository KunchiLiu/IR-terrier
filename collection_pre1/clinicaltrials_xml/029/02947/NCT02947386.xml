	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) identify maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) nimotuzumab combine nivolumab therapy advance non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) order establish recommend phase II dose ( RP2D ) . ( Phase I ) II . To evaluate efficacy nimotuzumab combination nivolumab patient advanced NSCLC , assess Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) version 1.1 guideline compare historical outcome nivolumab alone . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Characterize safety profile nivolumab combination nimotuzumab NCSLC . ( Phase I ) II . To evaluate safety tolerability nimotuzumab combination nivolumab use Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program ( CTEP ) National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE version 4.0 ) . ( Phase I ) III . Determine immune analysis profile nivolumab combination nimotuzumab . ( Phase I ) IV . Determine preliminary efficacy study combination utilize RECIST 1.1 guideline . ( Phase I ) V. Overall response rate ( ORR ) per immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( irRC ) irRECIST . ( Phase I ) VI . Progression-free survival ( PFS ) rate 1 year . ( Phase I ) VII . Progression-free survival ( PFS ) . ( Phase I ) VIII . Overall survival ( OS ) . ( Phase I ) IX . Disease control rate ( DCR ) stable disease ( SD ) . ( Phase I ) X . To evaluate efficacy nimotuzumab combination nivolumab patient advanced NSCLC compare historic outcome nivolumab alone , determine secondary measure efficacy , include : overall response rate ( ORR ) per immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( irRC ) irRECIST . ( Phase II ) XI . To evaluate efficacy nimotuzumab combination nivolumab patient advanced NSCLC compare historic outcome nivolumab alone , determine secondary measure efficacy , include : progression-free survival ( PFS ) rate 1 year . ( Phase II ) XII . To evaluate efficacy nimotuzumab combination nivolumab patient advanced NSCLC compare historic outcome nivolumab alone , determine secondary measure efficacy , include : progression-free survival ( PFS ) . ( Phase II ) XIII . To evaluate efficacy nimotuzumab combination nivolumab patient advanced NSCLC compare historic outcome nivolumab alone , determine secondary measure efficacy , include : overall survival ( OS ) . ( Phase II ) XIV . To evaluate efficacy nimotuzumab combination nivolumab patient advanced NSCLC compare historic outcome nivolumab alone , determine secondary measure efficacy , include : disease control rate ( DCR ) stable disease ( SD ) . ( Phase II ) TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Examine relationship EGFR expression tissue PFS , OS , ORR adverse event ( AE ) . ( Phase I ) II . Examine relationship infiltrate CD4+ CD8+ T cell immune genetic marker , associate PD-1 , CD45RA CD45RO level ; PD-L1 expression within neoplastic non-neoplastic stromal element tumor microenvironment PFS , OS , ORR AE . ( Phase I ) III . Comparison response assessment criterion prospective analysis ; irRECIST response assessment ; irRC . ( Phase I ) IV . Examine relationship EGFR expression tissue PFS , OS , ORR AE . ( Phase II ) V. Examine relationship infiltrate CD4+ CD8+ T cell immune genetic marker , associate PD-1 , CD45RA CD45RO level . ( Phase II ) VI . Examine relationship PD-L1 expression within neoplastic non-neoplastic stromal element tumor microenvironment PFS , OS , ORR AE . ( Phase II ) VII . Comparison response assessment criterion prospective analysis ; irRECIST response assessment ; irRC . ( Phase II ) OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study nimotuzumab follow phase II study . Patients receive nivolumab intravenously ( IV ) 60 minute nimotuzumab IV 60 minute day 1 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day every 12 week .</detailed_description>
