	<brief_summary>There several way perform liver biopsy , include percutaneous route ( historical gold standard ) via endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS ) guidance . The primary aim study prospectively compare patient undergo EUS-guided liver biopsy patient undergo percutaneous biopsy . The investigator hypothesize ( 1 ) patient randomize undergo EUS-guided liver biopsy rate less pain 48 hour follow procedure , ( 2 ) comparable histologic yield 2:1 match cohort patient undergo percutaneous liver biopsy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison EUS-Guided Liver Biopsy With Percutaneous Liver Biopsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently , liver biopsy gold standard determine index liver fibrosis patient chronic liver disease , whether patient progress cirrhosis . These biopsy predominantly perform percutaneously . However , several complication relate liver biopsy , common pain bleeding . There significant movement past several year assess utility alternative technique approach evaluation liver disease . Endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS ) well-established technique diagnostic therapeutic evaluation gastrointestinal pancreaticobiliary disorder . EUS-guided liver biopsy ( EUS-LB ) show technically simple , safe , provide adequate diagnostic yield evaluation liver disease child adult . There several advantage EUS-LB . First , would theoretically less painful percutaneous approach , require skin puncture also offer comfort sedation analgesia . It also eliminate need breath hold . Furthermore , image-guided approach allow visualization avoidance blood vessel even 1 mm size . Additionally , provide access area much wider segment liver parenchyma entire leave lobe , majority right lobe evaluate possible needle puncture sit stomach duodenal bulb , respectively . In addition obtain tissue , EUS-LB also offer benefit evaluate biliary tree , gallbladder , pancreas , lymph node , vascular anatomy comprehensive evaluation setting . Finally , patient ultimately find biopsy-proven cirrhosis , simultaneously provide necessary variceal screen would otherwise require additional procedure . The aim study prospectively perform EUS-guided liver biopsy patient otherwise candidate percutaneous biopsy . We hypothesize ( 1 ) patient randomize undergo EUS-guided liver biopsy rate less pain 48 hour follow procedure ( 2 ) comparable histologic yield 2:1 match cohort patient undergo percutaneous transjugular liver biopsy .</detailed_description>
