	<brief_summary>Femoroacetabular impingement pathologic process within hip joint result mechanical discord femoral head neck acetabulum result chronic hip pain , hip labral tear early progression osteoarthritis hip.1 , 2 Historically open surgical hip dislocation perform treat patient condition , however recent advance arthroscopy , patient commonly undergo arthroscopic hip surgery . From pain management standpoint , previous attempt provide peri-operative analgesia include intraarticular portal analgesic injection . More recently , regional anesthesia technique employ provide reliable long last post-operative pain control.3 , 4 Currently , several local anesthetic available regional anesthesia . However , provide average 12-18 hour post-operative pain control follow single injection.5 Bupivacaine local anesthetic use many year multiple route control post-operative pain . A new formulation medication prolongs release active ingredient single injection show result 72 hour post-operative analgesia.6 , 7 To investigator 's knowledge , study literature compare historical control local anesthetic new formulation liposomal bupivacaine via fascial iliaca regional soft tissue infiltration blockade provide post operative pain control follow hip arthroscopy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hip Arthroscopy Pain Control Randomized Control Trial ( RCT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study double-blinded prospective randomize control trial . Patients randomize 1:1 ratio either liposomal bupivacaine group versus bupivacaine alone . Randomization assignment determine use computer program base random number generation , equal number treatment block 2 , 4 , 6 patient . The order block randomize well . Treatment assignment conceal sequentially numbered opaque seal envelope ( SNOSE ) . The anesthesia provider administer medication investigator study allow know medication administer ensure safety regard potential medication interaction study medication may medication anesthesia provide operation . This study double blind associate investigator ( anesthesia resident/fellow ) conduct post-operative pain score , Defense Veterans Pain Rating Scale ( DVPRS ) evaluation , un-aware medication patient receive fascial iliac regional soft tissue infiltration blockade . The anesthesia resident/fellow remain blinded medication patient receive access patient electronic medical record , participate procedure , access database create orthopaedics resident information enter . The treating surgeon also blind medication administer present randomization process make aware medication patient receive final two-week postoperative pain assessment oral pain medication pill count , patient study participation conclude . The success blinding evaluate ask patient , anesthesia resident/fellow treat surgeon guess treatment assignment day surgery , pain score collection process final two-week routine follow appointment .</detailed_description>
