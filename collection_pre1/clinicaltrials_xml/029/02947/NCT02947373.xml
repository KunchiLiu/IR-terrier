	<detailed_description>This open label trial ass safety tolerability adult tolerate dose Hyperpolarized Pyruvate ( HP ) metabolic image child brain tumor require sedation MR imaging . Nine patient receive single MR image examination include acquisition hyperpolarized 13C metabolic data combination anatomic , diffusion , perfusion lactate edit 1H spectroscopic image data . The data process use custom design software estimate change level lactate/pyruvate relate abnormality observe data MR modality . The result study provide safety data require move type metabolic image therapeutic trial assess utility HP 13C lactate/pyruvate new surrogate marker drug tumor penetration early response therapy child brain tumor .</detailed_description>
