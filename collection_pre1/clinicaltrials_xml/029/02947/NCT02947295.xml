	<brief_title>Global Genomic Proteomic Profiling African Children With Typhoid Fever</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Typhoid fever cause Salmonella enteric serovar Typhi ( S. typhi ) , human specific pathogen . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) recognize typhoid fever global health problem , estimate 21 million case 200,000-600,000 death annually . In Africa South Asia , young child represent subgroup high disease burden . The onset illness insidious clinical diagnosis often unreliable . Definitive diagnosis blood bone-marrow culture labor-intensive , expensive , invasive , sensitivity 40 70 % . WHO recommend routine typhoid fever vaccination currently license vaccine provide 55-75 % protection disease . Therefore , urgent need develop rapid , sensitive , inexpensive diagnostic method , well efficacious vaccine country typhoid fever remain major public health burden . Our long term goal 1 ) develop innovative molecular diagnostic assay rapid inexpensive detection typhoid fever , 2 ) good understand molecular mechanism host response facilitate development next-generation typhoid fever vaccine . Our immediate objective obtain global gene expression proteomic profile S. Typhi infect African child , identify validate classifier gene proteins potential diagnostic biomarkers vaccine target . We already establish bacteremia surveillance system central Nigeria since 2008 . A pilot study initiate small cohort Nigerian child typhoid fever . Our preliminary data show unique gene expression profile host response peripheral blood child typhoid fever compare bacteremic infection , well patient acute vs. convalescent phase . Here , hypothesize distinct classifier gene protein base host response peripheral blood serum obtain discriminate typhoid fever bacteremic infection healthy control . Our specific aim : 1 . Define typhoid fever-specific host response classifier gene use gene expression ( GE ) micro-arrays , 2 . Discover specific serum anti-typhoid fever protein use newly establish S. Typhi proteome micro-arrays develop prototype serologic assay acute typhoid ( ELISA ) 3 . Validate classifier gene field-test prototype ELISAs use new , independent cohort . To accomplish objective , assemble multidisciplinary team expertise infectious disease , immunology , molecular genomics/proteomics , micro-arrays , bioinformatics ensure success project . These study identify distinct classifier gene protein typhoid fever infection base immunological response . Classifiers discriminate S. Typhi bacteremia possible develop offer rapid , inexpensive , non-invasive , sensitive molecular diagnostic assay specific typhoid fever . Classifier protein obtain new , custom whole-proteome typhoid fever micro-arrays provide new insight target protein antibody next-generation vaccine development .</detailed_description>
