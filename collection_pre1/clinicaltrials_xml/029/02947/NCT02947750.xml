	<brief_summary>The purpose study find patient chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) poor exercise capacity explore cause increase blood pressure exercise ( i.e . increase adrenaline level , decrease ability blood vessel dilate ) . This study also test whether regular exercise bicycle and/or treatment 6R-BH4 ( Kuvan ) pills improves measure exercise . 6R-BH4 currently FDA-approved use patient certain form disease call phenylketonuria , currently FDA approve blood pressure exercise capacity people CKD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The major problem address study understand mechanism underlie poor exercise capacity patient chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) . Prior research find CKD patient exaggerated increase blood pressure certain form exercise could contribute exercise dysfunction well cardiovascular disease . This study test mechanism underlie exaggerated blood pressure response , well potential benefit simple measure exercise train stationary bicycle , treatment 6R-BH4 , drug currently FDA-approved treatment phenylketonuria , show beneficial effect vascular health patient kidney disease . Prior intervention portion study , researcher measure much vein constrict response adrenaline CKD patient versus control . The study also measure muscle pH , muscle oxygenation exercise CKD patient control . The intervention portion study test whether aerobic exercise training without 6R-BH4 might help muscle pH adrenaline level , vascular reactivity , muscle oxygenation , exaggerate blood pressure response exercise CKD patient . Participants randomize use 2x2 factorial design exercise training ( ET ) 6R-BH4 , ET placebo , stretch ( control condition exercise ) 6R-BH4 , stretch placebo . Participants undergo exercise training stationary bicycle , stretch exercise , 3 time per week 6-14 week ( depend availability participant ) .</detailed_description>
