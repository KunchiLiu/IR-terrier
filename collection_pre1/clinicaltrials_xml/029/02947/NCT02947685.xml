	<brief_summary>The primary objective study demonstrate combination palbociclib anti-HER2 therapy plus endocrine therapy superior anti-HER2-based therapy plus endocrine therapy alone improve outcome subject hormone receptor-positive , HER2+ metastatic breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized , Open Label , Clinical Study Targeted Therapy , Palbociclib , Treat Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects randomize one two treatment arm follow minimum 4 maximum 8 cycle induction treatment anti-HER2 therapy . Arm A subject receive experimental therapy , palbociclib , addition current anti-HER2 therapy endocrine therapy . Arm B subject continue receive anti-HER2 therapy . It expect addition palbociclib first-line treatment HER2 disease delay onset therapeutic resistance ultimately prolong survival patient metastatic breast cancer . The study design treat subset patient HER2+ disease also hormone receptor positive ( HR+ ) . It also expect palbociclib modulate endocrine resistance HER2+/HR+ disease potentiate benefit anti-HER2 therapy . Lastly , current study include comprehensive molecular characterization disease study entrance allow u investigate benefit palbociclib subset HER2+/HR+ disease PIK3CA mutant .</detailed_description>
