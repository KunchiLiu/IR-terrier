Peer befrienders complete outcome measure train complete visit two participant . In addition , RCT include qualitative study feasibility economic evaluation . The qualitative study use semi-structured interview purposively sample participant ( n=20 ) significant others ( n=10 ) arm trial , peer befrienders . The feasibility economic evaluation utilise EQ-5D stroke-adapted version CSRI . Outcomes : RCT : feasibility recruitment participant definitive trial ( include proportion screen meet criterion ; proportion consent ; rate consent ) ; number missing/incomplete data outcome measure ; attrition rate follow-up ; potential value conduct main trial use value information analysis ( economic evaluation ) ; description usual care ; treatment fidelity peer befriend .
