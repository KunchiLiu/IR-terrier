	<brief_summary>The purpose research compare effect single-injection sciatic PNB continuous sciatic PNB 1 ) postoperative pain control measure self-reported pain score , pain medication use , unplanned hospital admission due poor pain control , 2 ) active knee flexion , 3 ) patient satisfaction pain control follow ACL reconstruction hamstring autograft . The result research potential positively impact pain control adolescent population undergo surgical procedure foster responsible utilization limited resource .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sciatic Technique Comparison Nerve Blockade Pain Control Following Hamstring Autograft Harvest Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SPECIFIC AIM 1 . The first aim study explore impact sciatic PNB technique hamstring donor site pain control postoperatively . H1.a . The extended duration analgesia offer continuous sciatic PNB decrease pain score initial 72 hour follow hamstring autograft harvest compare single-injection sciatic PNB . H1.b . The extended duration analgesia offer continuous sciatic PNB decrease oral pain medication use initial 72 hour follow hamstring autograft harvest compare single-injection sciatic PNB . H1.c . The extended duration analgesia offer continuous sciatic PNB decrease incidence unplanned admission due poor pain control initial 72 hour follow hamstring autograft harvest compare single-injection sciatic PNB . SPECIFIC AIM 2 . The second aim study explore impact sciatic PNB technique active knee flexion postoperatively . H2 . The extended duration analgesia offer continuous sciatic PNB delay active knee flexion initial 72 hour follow hamstring autograft harvest compare single-injection sciatic PNB . SPECIFIC AIM 3 . The third aim study explore impact sciatic PNB technique patient satisfaction postoperative pain control . H3.1 . The extended duration analgesia offer continuous sciatic PNB improve patient satisfaction initial 72 hour follow hamstring autograft harvest compare single-injection sciatic PNB .</detailed_description>
