Planned sample size : 165 eligible participant distribute 1:1:1 three group . Group 1 ( control ) - treatment usual ( TAU ) . Group 2 - Self-monitoring ( Se-MO ) . Group 3 - Self-monitoring self-management ( Se-Man ) . Primary outcome : Number reach target Ambulatory BP level follow-up change mean Ambulatory BP level baseline follow-up 6 month . Secondary outcome : Number change anti-hypertensive treatment study Side-effects profile adverse event BP variability Pulse Wave Velocity ( PWV ) change All cause cause-specific mortality outcome six month Recurrent TIA stroke Incident CVD- stroke , TIA myocardial infarction Costs Health relate quality life assess Quality Adjusted Life Years ( EQ-5D base ) Patient satisfaction experience process ( qualitative data )</detailed_description>
