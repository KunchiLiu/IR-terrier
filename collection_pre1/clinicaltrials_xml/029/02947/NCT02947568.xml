	<brief_title>Genetical Background Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease ( NAFLD ) Diabetes Mellitus Chronic Kidney Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) multisystemic disease , also affect extrahepatic organ ( 1,2,6 ) . According former data , prevalence chronic hepatic disease , chronic cardiovascular disease , also prevalence chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) high NAFLD ( 4,7 ) . A strong association show diabetes mellitus ( DM ) NAFLD well ( 3,5,10 ) . Many genetical factor study background NAFLD . Many study prove effect patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3 gene ( PNPLA3 ) ( 8,9 ) . Effect numerous genetical polymorphism suggest behind oxidative stress responsible NAFLD ( 8 ) .</detailed_description>
