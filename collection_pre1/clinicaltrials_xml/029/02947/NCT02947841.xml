	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate hypothesis alternate DBS parameter weekly basis prevent tolerance stimulation thus wan benefit , compare non-alternating stimulation . The primary endpoint preserve tremor control alternate group compare standard treatment use Tremor Research Group Essential Tremor Rating Assessment Scale ( TETRAS ) . Key secondary endpoint preserved activity daily live measure well preserve tremor control quantify motion sensor data . This study one primary aim : To determine alternate DBS stimulation parameter weekly basis superior preserve tremor control compare usual stimulation ( non-alternating stimulation ) ET patient VIM DBS .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Patients clinically diagnose ET placement VIM DBS willing undergo baseline program visit 12week followup assessment 2 . At least initial benefit VIM DBS judge patient report clinician exam 3 . VIM DBS placement less three month entry study 4 . Patients must demonstrate ability use patient programmer switch group setting weekly basis 5 . Ability wear wrist monitor 2 week interval , twice study 6 . Patients follow IPG type : Activa PC , SC RC 1 . Atypical tremor disorder include limited tremor due multiple sclerosis , medicationinduced tremor , Parkinson 's disease parkinsonian syndrome 2 . DBS placement complicate infection , hemorrhage stroke 3 . Previous thalamotomy ( either stereotactic , gamma knife focus ultrasound ) previous DBS surgery result explantation reimplantation 4 . Known incorrect poor lead placement 5 . Inability change group setting weekly basis least 75 % time 6 . Inability tolerate 12week period without additional programming change , include voltage stimulation adjustment 7 . Inability tolerate 12week period without adjustment antitremor medication , include primidone , betablockers , gabapentin , topiramate and/or benzodiazepine 8 . Battery voltage &lt; equal 2.70V 9 . Patient follow IPG type : Soletra , Kinetra Itrel 10 . Inability tolerate two group setting due side effect lack efficacy</criteria>
