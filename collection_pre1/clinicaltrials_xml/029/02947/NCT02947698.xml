	<brief_title>Effect Weekend Admission Mortality Associated With Severe Acute Kidney Injury England : Propensity Score Matched , Population-based Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several study report unwanted adverse effect weekend admission mortality certain acute medical condition . Though reason variation could illness severity , study hypothesize could due variation care provide weekend service minimum . The increased mortality weekend certain condition National Health Service ( NHS ) England lead intense debate reconfiguring health service . Little known impact weekend effect severe acute kidney require dialysis ( AKI-D ) England , incidence increase 12-foldover past 15 year . Most nephrology department England provide continuous consultant cover weekend capacity perform emergency dialysis need weekend suggest weekend effect less likely occur . Patients admit weekend may present three way - severe AKI require dialysis weekend , AKI require dialysis subsequent weekday AKI , develop AKI-D in-patient stay next day . Some study report patient start dialysis Sunday diagnosis severe AKI weekend , affect mortality , others report increased mortality AKI size hospital weekend . One explanation observation necessary dialysis therapy may initiate weekend result limitation physician nurse staff device availability . However , bias create single center study well recognize epidemiology AKI-D show considerable regional variation may true day week . It also speculate patient admitted weekend may receive optimal care result development new AKI progression AKI AKI-D result excess mortality . With background , investigator want investigate whether weekend effect mortality exist AKI-D patient England . The investigator hypothesize patient admitted weekend would increase mortality irrespective demographic feature clinical characteristic . They also hypothesize effect mortality would pronounce center on-site nephrology service .</detailed_description>
