	<brief_summary>Children burn injury experience severe pain intensity medical procedure despite increase dos analgesic . Current guideline pediatric procedural pain management recommend combination non-pharmacological pharmacological intervention enhance pain management decrease numerous side effect analgesic . Virtual reality ( VR ) gain grow consideration non-pharmacological method engage multiple sens allow interaction virtual world . Oculus Rift ® new technology VR provide immersiveness , relatively low cost , could probably improve management pain anxiety burn care . It also potential , appropriate custom software design burn pediatric patient , reduce cybersickness symptom ( nausea , dizziness ) associate VR . To knowledge investigator , none pediatric hospital across Canada test VR method pain anxiety management child burn injury . Overall hypothesis : VR distraction via Oculus Rift ® could effective method relieve pain , anxiety , well less traumatizing hospital experience , promote humanistic care environment combine new technology ( VR via Oculus Rift ® ) standard analgesic intervention administer child . The expected result direct effect physical ( pain ) psychological ( anxiety , pain memory ) health child . In addition , clinical implication may include indicator quality care economic benefit wider range motion burn limbs reduction dosage opioids anxiolytic drug administer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Decreasing REcurrent Pain Anxiety Medical Procedures With Pediatric Population : Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . BACKGROUND : Burn injury lead cause morbidity mortality child . They associate lot pain difficult treat impede recovery , cause high level anxiety alter future pain behavior , result time chronic pain , paresthesia , depression . Pain also decrease participation treatment physiotherapy result poor health outcome . Beyond immediate pain experience , child may develop memory accurate , positively negatively estimate ( i.e. , remember less pain , respectively , compare initial pain report ) . The way child 's memory frame important future pain cop distress subsequent painful experience . Moreover , show pharmacological non-pharmacological pain management strategy may buffer child develop bias pain memory . Procedural pain still largely manage pharmacologically mostly use opioids , benzodiazepine pharmacological agent cause lot side effect always provide sufficient pain reduction . In recent year , effectiveness multimodal approach combine medication non-pharmacological intervention procedural pain relief highlight . Distraction technique engage multiple sens may grab child ` attention technique engage one sense ( e.g , music ) , hence , increase interest immersive interactive method distraction VR . VR active distraction method allow user interact immersive environment generate computer stimulate different sens . A review study VR , mostly conduct adult burn patient , show 35 50 % reduction procedural pain use VR . However , despite promising result , use VR healthcare setting limit , mainly due high cost . Reviews highlight need research mostly development portable , less expensive developed VR system would promote pain reduction burn procedure especially child burn injury consider one challenge burn population . However , breakthrough technology since 2014 big scale company start invest VR development commercial gaming . Facebook purchase Oculus Rift® mass production allow access late technology VR relatively low cost . Oculus Rift® VR tool provide wide field view , high resolution display , integrate 3D audio motion detection . In addition , highly immersive property could help achieve analgesia compare VR technique review show sense presence influence effectiveness VR-based analgesia . The sense presence subjective psychological state consciousness virtual world whereas immersiveness refers physical environment could quantify measure field view peripheral vision VR goggles . The availability inexpensive yet highly immersive VR google Oculus Rift® could increase use VR pain management burn setting significantly improve cost effectiveness . A single case study assess feasibility VR intervention via Oculus Rift® one child 11 year old burn injuries occupational therapy . The study show reduction pain intensity pain unpleasantness experienced patient , without side effect . To knowledge investigator , study test distraction via Oculus Rift® procedural pain management child burn injury undergo painful physiotherapy treatment . 2 . AIM : The aim study assess effect distraction VR via Oculus Rift® relief procedural pain , anxiety decrease memory pain child burn injury . Primary Research Question : In child age 7 18 year , suffer burn injury , VR distraction via Oculus Rift® combine analgesic provide good pain relief painful procedure include dress change physiotherapy standard pharmacological treatment alone ? Secondary Research Questions : ) In child age 7 18 year , suffer burn injury , VR distraction via Oculus Rift® combine analgesic provide good anxiety relief dress change physiotherapy standard pharmacological treatment alone ? b ) Does use VR distraction lead less distressing memory pain standard pharmacological treatment alone ? c ) Does use VR distraction reduce dose side effect analgesic use burn wound dress change physiotherapy child ? 3 . HYPOTHESES 1 . VR distraction via Oculus Rift® combine analgesic effective standard treatment ( analgesic alone ) manage procedural pain child burn injury . 2 . VR distraction via Oculus Rift® combine analgesic effective standard treatment ( analgesic alone ) procedural anxiety child burn injury . 3 . VR distraction via Oculus Rift® combine analgesic lead less distressing memory pain standard treatment ( analgesic alone ) child burn injury 4 . METHODS 4.1 Design . One-group within subject/crossover study design . Given difficulty ensure single double-blind condition , order limit interpersonal variability participant , child serve control receive standard experimental treatment treatment session randomize order . 4.2 Sample Setting . Participants recruit convenience sample upon admission surgical-trauma burn unit CHU Ste-Justine , Montreal ( Qc ) , Canada . For statistical power 80 % , alpha 0.05 , significant difference two point 0 10 NRS pain scale , size total desire sample 40 participant serve control . The setting study main referral center pediatric burn Quebec . It receive nearly 60 admission time year high incidence burn ( April October ) close 100 admission per year . One third total admission age 7 year old . Given possible census 33 admission per year , appear feasible recruit around 40 patient period two year . This also reason behind choice design would feasible give total population available recruitment . .3 Interventions . A ) Standard pharmacological treatment B ) Standard treatment addition Virtual Reality distraction via Oculus Rift 4.4 . Measures . Pain , anxiety comfort measure take treatment ( physiotherapy dress change ) session ( T1 ) ( expectancy baseline state ) , first sequence session ( T2 ) second sequence session ( T3 ) . Healthcare professional ask fill anonymous satisfaction questionnaire 30 minute end session ( T4 ) . Memories pain/anxiety assess least 24 hour procedure ( T5 ) . 4.5 Study proceeding . Physiotherapy dress change session typically last 10 20 minute . The duration divide two sequence duration ( 5 10 minute ) participant receives treatment ( range-of-motion exercise physiotherapy wound cleaning gauze application dress change ) healthcare professional ( physiotherapist nurse ) . For one sequence , standard pharmacological treatment administer sequence , patient receive standard pharmacological treatment addition virtual reality distraction via OR . The order sequence randomize . 4.6 Data analysis plan . Multivariate Analyses quantitative comparison conduct within subject dependent variable repeat measure . The mean difference pain score patient time-period compare use paired t-test . Since use rescue medication potential indication treatment failure , primary analysis supplement analysis compare proportion patient receive rescue medication anytime procedure . Interpretation primary analysis make reference data regard rescue medication use . Data collect dichotomous variable analyze use chi-square test post-hoc analysis result statistically significant .</detailed_description>
