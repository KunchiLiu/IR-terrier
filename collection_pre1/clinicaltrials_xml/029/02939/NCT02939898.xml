	<brief_summary>The goal project identify autocrine , paracrine endocrine factor associate intercycle variation cyclical follicle recruitment . Patients monitor natural cycle , stimulate cycle follow . In stimulated cycle patient randomize co-treatment aromatase inhibitor placebo ovarian stimulation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary aim project explore putative cyclic recruitment 'gatekeeping ' function gonadotropin , sex steroid , anti-muellarian hormone pregnancy associate plasma protein A normal ovulatory cycle , impact ovarian stimulation cyclic follicle recruitment follow cycle . It propose supra-physiological level estradiol progesterone arise ovarian stimulation may modulate size secondarily recruit follicle cohort next cycle . In order explore relative contribution sex steroid determinant size next cycle 'wave ' recruitment , second aim study investigate whether limit rise sex steroid level ovarian stimulation , co-treatment aromatase inhibitor impact cyclic recruitment .</detailed_description>
