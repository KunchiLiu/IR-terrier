	<brief_summary>When patient bowel surgery sometimes leave stoma , small bowel exit onto wall abdomen , colon . Certain food show increase amount water lose stoma . This lead dehydration . Such patient encourage avoid food know one avoid relies partly trial error . In survey 1 3 patient say rhubarb increase stoma output . Rhubarb known contain chemical stimulate bowel . 1 6 patient also report effect lettuce previously show effect . Latex find lettuce leaf may stimulate bowel produce fluid , explain effect . In Nottingham investigator develop technique use Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) measure water small bowel . They want use technique explore whether eat lettuce increase small bowel water content . They compare lettuce rhubarb bread , know reduce small bowel water . They see detect relationship water bowel feeling bloating .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessing Effect Lettuce Intestinal Water Content Through Magnetic Resonance Imaging Small Bowel</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : In recent year fermentable oligo- , di- , mono-saccharides polyols , propose exacerbate symptom irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) abdominal discomfort bloating . This phenomenon also observe patient ileostomy , certain food associate increase fluid output stoma . This accordance past work survey ileostomy patient food alter stoma function . However , may factor drive fluid output stoma . Rhubarb , food list 1 3 patient exacerbate watery diarrhoea , also contain anthraquinones laxative effect , senna . A food less commonly associate laxative effect lettuce 1 6 patient report eat lettuce lead increase watery stoma output . Certain lettuce variety exude milk-like latex material cut , give rise latin name Lactuca sativa . While methylcellulose insoluble would expect hold water lumen small bowel , latex could expect stimulate intestinal secretion . This may contribute post-prandial sensation bloat different mechanism osmotic effect colonic fermentation see poorly absorb fermentable carbohydrates.. The Nottingham GI MRI group forefront elucidate effect poorly digest carbohydrate gastrointestinal physiology . investigator publish technique measure free water small bowel assessment viscosity colon use MR relaxometry . This include demonstration fructose ingestion lead increase free water small bowel compare co-ingestion glucose - see panel . The investigator wish apply technique compare effect different food : white bread , lettuce rhubarb . The investigator previously show bread lead reduction small bowel water active negative control . Rhubarb serve positive control . Aims : The purpose study gather pilot data effect different food intestinal physiology .</detailed_description>
