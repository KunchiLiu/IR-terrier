	<brief_summary>One reason people gain weight eat calorie food need energy 24 hour . Metabolism amount energy person use 24 hour . Researchers want study relationship change metabolism much person eats . Objectives : To see much food person eat body temperature cool . To study change metabolism may alter amount food person eats . Eligibility : Healthy people age 18-55 . Design : Participants stay NIH 20 day . During first 4 day , participant : - Medical exam - Electrocardiogram - Blood urine test . One blood test include drinking sugar solution . - DXA body composition scan - Questions food like , physical activity , personal behavior - Exercise test stationary bicycle Participants spend 24-hour period metabolic chamber . The chamber normal room temperature cooler . Some time , participant eat diet match daily need . Other time , eat much wish vending machine . Participants blood urine collect . Participants swallow ingestible wireless sensor wear small data recorder device . On second last day , participant stay metabolic chamber consume water non-caffeinated sugar-free beverage . Participants come back 1-day visit six month one year first admission . They blood urine test , DXA scan . They answer question physical activity food habit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>More 30 % adult consider overweight . In general , lifestyle change ( diet exercise ) current weight loss drug lead 5 10 % weight loss . This may person energy expenditure , aka number calorie body us , lead hunger may increase amount food person eats . Cold exposure know increase metabolism may lead weight loss appetite desire food also increase . The primary goal study evaluate whether change energy expenditure cool temperature exposure result change food intake . This study involve stay clinical research unit determine energy requirement ( 24 degree C ) 68 healthy , adult volunteer without evidence diabetes . Exposure cool temperature ( 16 degree C ) use increase number calorie person body use day . Participants spend 24 hour room measure energy expenditure temperature room turn , fix diet buffet food choice . After fixed diet , volunteer self-select much food wish eat one day vend machine . Volunteers also spend one day fast follow day self-selecting food vend machine . Findings study provide knowledge possible causal link energy expenditure eat behavior . This information may shed light many weight loss intervention increase energy expenditure work well expect , may eventually lead new weight loss approach therapy .</detailed_description>
