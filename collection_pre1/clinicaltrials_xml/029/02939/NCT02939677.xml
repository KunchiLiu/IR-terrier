	<brief_summary>Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction ( ACLR ) high volume surgery , carry 2800 patient annually Denmark per year . ACLR patient ( use hamstring auto-graft ) persistent hamstring strength deficiency evaluate 1-2 year ACL-reconstruction . The investigator design randomize control trial ( RCT ) main purpose investigate effect target muscle strength exercise intervention neuromuscular rehabilitation ACLR-patients compare 'care-as- usual ' . The study design prospective , superiority , parallel-group balance randomization ( 1:1 ) RCT ( Level evidence : II ) blind allocation , outcome assessment accord CONSORT statement ( Consolidated Standards Reporting Trials ) . 50 patient ACL reconstruction persistent hamstring muscle deficiency , recruit outpatient clinic 1-year follow-up , allocate one two 12 week ' intervention , either ) supervise progressive strength neuromuscular exercise group ( SNG ) supervise training twice weekly . Or b ) control group ( CON ) receive patient education base home-based exercise regime low intensity , define 'care usual ' . Outcome measure include , maximal isometric knee flexor muscle strength ( primary outcome ) , knee extensor strength , Knee injury Osteoarthritis Outcome Score ( KOOS ) ( secondary outcome ) . In addition , follow explorative outcome investigate ; hamstring quadriceps strength ratio , International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form ( IKDC ) , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) evaluate tendon regeneration hamstring finally kinetic/kinematic biomechanical outcome knee related functional task . To investigator knowledge , first RCT investigate efficacy combine progressive resistance training neuromuscular exercise late rehabilitation phase patient demonstrate persistent limb-to-limb knee muscle asymmetry follow ACLR . Reduced hamstring strength represent potential risk factor secondary ligament rupture accelerate progression osteoarthritis ( OA ) . If deem effective , intervention paradigm introduce study may help improve current treatment strategy .</brief_summary>
