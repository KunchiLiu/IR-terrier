	<criteria>General : 1 . Clinically significant symptomatic leg ischemia , require treatment SFA and/or popliteal artery ; 2 . Able willing provide inform consent prior study procedure ; 3 . Able willing comply followup requirement ; 4 . Rutherford Clinical Category 24 ; 5 . Resting ABI &lt; 0.9 abnormal exercise ABI ; 6 . ≥18 year old ; 7 . Life expectancy &gt; 2 year ; Angiographic Criteria : 8 . Cumulative lesion length ≥4 ≤15 cm within target vessel ; Cumulative lesion consist either single de novo lesion multiple lesion within 415 cm segment ; multiple lesion require meet following ; Separated gap ≤ 3 cm ; Able treat single lesion ; Total combine lesion length include 3cm gap meet requirement ; 9 . Lesion location start ≥2 cm distal common femoral bifurcation terminates ≥2 cm proximal origin tibioperoneal trunk ; 10 . Clinically hemodynamically significant de novo stenosis ( &gt; 70 % stenosis visual estimate ) occlusion ; 11 . Target vessel diameter ≥4 ≤6 mm able treat available device size matrix ; 12 . Successful , uncomplicated ( without use cross device ) antegrade wire cross lesion ; 13 . A patent inflow artery free significant lesion ( ≥50 % stenosis ) confirm angiography ( treatment target lesion acceptable successful treatment ipsilateral iliac lesion ) ; NOTE : Successful ipsilateral iliac artery treatment define attainment residual diameter stenosis ≤30 % without death major vascular complication . 14 . At least one patent native outflow artery ankle , free significant ( ≥50 % ) stenosis confirm angiography previously revascularized ; 1 . Pregnant lactating female ; 2 . Coexisting clinically significant aneurismal disease abdominal aorta , iliac popliteal artery ; 3 . Significant gastrointestinal bleeding coagulopathy would contraindicate use antiplatelet therapy ; 4 . Known intolerance study medication , paclitaxel contrast agent ; 5 . Patient participate another investigational device drug study reach primary endpoint ; 6 . History hemorrhagic stroke within 2 month ; 7 . Previous plan surgical interventional procedure within 30 day study procedure ; 8 . Diagnosed liver failure , renal failure , chronic kidney disease , unstable angina pectoris , myocardial infarction within 30 day procedure ; 9 . Presence significant stenosis occlusion inflow tract successfully treat prior study consideration . Successful define &lt; 30 % residual stenosis ipsilateral iliac artery major complication ; 10 . Acute thrombus target vessel ; 11 . At site target lesion , use adjunctive therapy ( i.e . laser , atherectomy , cryoplasty , scoring/cutting balloon , brachytherapy ) ; 12 . Outflow artery ( distal popliteal , anterior posterior tibial peroneal artery ) significant lesion ( ≥50 % stenosis ) may treated procedure ; 13 . Has instent restenosis target lesion ; 14 . Previous treatment drug coat PTA balloon catheter drug elute stent target vessel within 12 month index procedure ; 15 . Previous peripheral bypass affect target limb ; 16 . Has injury target vessel , major flowlimiting dissection ( &gt; NHLBI Grade C ) perforation , require stenting prior enrollment ; 17 . Obvious subintimal recanalization intentional subintimal recanalization occlusive lesion ; 18 . Presence severe calcification target lesion precludes endovascular treatment . Severe calcification define circumferential calcification involve ≥ 50 % vessel diameter .</criteria>
