	<detailed_description>The role immune response Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) controversial . Recent study show neuron present MHC-I ( major histocompatibility complex - class 1 ) molecule therefore may susceptible attack immune cell . The investigator anticipate result study improve understand mechanism immune mediate neuronal degeneration PD . Initial result suggest antigens present neuronal MHC-I PD , could lead T-cell mediated neuronal death . The obvious antigen could differentially express PD patient control would alpha-synuclein ( -syn ) : -syn oligomers appear Lewy body Lewy neurites hallmark PD change brain . This study offer opportunity characterize immune mediate component PD , continue elucidate biology underlies antigen presentation T-cell cytolytic activity .</detailed_description>
