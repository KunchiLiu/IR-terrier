	<brief_title>Does Rescue Course Betamethasone Pregnant Women With PPROM Decrease Neonatal Morbidity ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While fetal benefit repeat course antenatal corticosteroid demonstrate several randomized control study , investigator ' knowledge adequately demonstrate woman PPROM . Given potential benefit repeat course antenatal corticosteroid woman PPROM decrease neonatal morbidity reassure data various cohort safety , investigator seek propose randomize control trial ( RCT ) hypothesis repeat course antenatal corticosteroid woman PPROM decrease neonatal morbidity . Objectives 1 . To evaluate impact maternal treatment second course betamethasone infant length stay NICU . 2 . To evaluate impact maternal treatment second course betamethasone duration neonatal need oxygen supplementation . 3 . To evaluate impact maternal treatment second course betamethasone neonatal morbidity overall . Hypotheses The investigator hypothesize treatment woman PPROM 24 34 week gestation repeat course antenatal corticosteroid decrease infant length stay NICU neonatal morbidity . Aim To describe compare neonatal outcome PPROM infant expose repeat course antenatal corticosteroid compare infant antenatal condition expose one betamethasone course . Subject Safety Data Monitoring This study place subject risk safety . This medication well study know safe pregnancy . Data monitoring perform view study personnel . The data de-identified study number assign patient . The patient 's identity secure UTMB encrypt laptop device hard copy store lock file cabinet lock office principal investigator . Procedures Maintain Confidentiality : Data view study personnel . The data de-identified study number assign patient . The patient 's identity secure UTMB encrypt laptop device hard copy store lock file cabinet lock office principal investigator . Potential Benefits The potential benefit subject participate study include possible decreased neonatal morbidity length stay NICU . Biostatistics Using data University Texas Medical Branch ( UTMB ) woman PPROM 24 34 week , fit inclusion criterion , receive standard one course betamethasone , average length stay NICU 59.3 ± 36.3 day . The gestational age delivery cohort 26.5 ± 3.2 week . Assuming second course betamethasone reduce length stay need NICU 35 % , power 80 % alpha 0.05 , anticipate enrollment 49 woman group need , 98 woman total . At UTMB , approximately 400 woman per year hospitalize PPROM . Assuming 50 % eligible woman consent , investigator estimate finish recruitment study 1-2 year . Sample Size Assumptions 1 . Frequency primary outcome control group ( single course betamethasone ) : 59.3 day . The investigator assume 35 % reduction length NICU stay use two course betamethasone . 2. α = 0.05 , two side 3. β = 0.2 4 . Effect size : 35 % reduction primary outcome</detailed_description>
