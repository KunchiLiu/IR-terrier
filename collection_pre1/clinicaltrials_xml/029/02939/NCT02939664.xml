	<brief_summary>This study try identify difference length operation , weight loss complication , two different bariatric surgical technique , laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass laparoscopic Roux-en-Y band gastric bypass . The study conduct Spanish public health system hospital . The patient trial preoperative study , hospital treatment admission , postoperative treatment follow patient include hospital bariatric surgery program . The study case place around gastric pouch band polypropylene mesh , randomly choose participant . Patients randomize 5/3 ( study/control ) ratio .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Laparoscopic Gastric Bypass Versus Laparoscopic Banded Gastric Bypass Randomized Prospective Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One group patient study do simplified laparoscopic gastric bypass , vertical gastric pouch 20 ml , 150 cm Roux-en-Y limb construct antegastric antecolic fashion , biliary limb 100 cm . Anastomosis do endoscopic surgical linear stapler , close aperture continuous absorbable running suture . The Petersen space mesenteric defect close non-absorbable suture . The group patient perform laparoscopic Roux-en-Y band gastric bypass . This technique identical one perform group , differs polypropylene mesh ( 10x65 mm ) place 15 mm proximal anastomosis around gastric pouch , gastric pouch 15 mm longer . The investigator randomly assign 50 patient study group ( Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y band gastric bypass ) 30 control group ( Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass ) , n=80 , also blind surgeon surgery . One method basically , placement polypropylene mesh around gastric pouch anastomosis , patient series Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y band gastric bypass show long term well weight loss series band gastric bypass , thus expect difference long term weight loss group . Fisher Test use statistical analysis , assume risk 0.05 statistical power 90 % . Sample size calculate consider bibliographic long term weight loss group , 82 % band group versus 63 % band group . Thus sample size ( n ) : 67 , adjust loss sample size : 79 ( 10 % expect loss ratio ) , necessary 1 : 1 ratio case control require 25 control , A sample size 50 case 30 control , total n = 80 , use . The method randomization conceal envelope .</detailed_description>
