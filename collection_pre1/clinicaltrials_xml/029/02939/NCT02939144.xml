	<brief_summary>Aldosterone , major mineralocorticoid hormone cortisol , major glucocorticoid hormone produce adrenal gland . Aldosterone bind intracellular mineralocorticoid receptor ( MR ) kidney promote urinary reabsorption sodium water excretion potassium hydrogen ion . Unregulated mineralocorticoid excess may , therefore , lead high blood pressure due sodium water retention hypokalaemic alkalosis . Blood concentration cortisol equal affinity MR 1000fold great aldosterone . Therefore order overwhelm MR , cortisol need inactivated bind MR . This achieve enzyme 11-betahydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 ( 11ßHSD-2 ) kidney rapidly inactivate cortisol cortisone ( process allow aldosterone bind MR ) . Reduced activity 11ßHSD-2 lead accumulation cortisol bind MR hence effect aldosterone . Reduced activity 11ßHSD-2 may see inherited condition 'Apparent mineralocorticoid excess ( AME ) ' excessive liquorice ingestion . The diagnosis AME liquorice toxicity difficult due unavailability diagnostic urine analysis general laboratory . Cortisol salivary gland , similarly kidney , metabolise 11β-HSD2 cortisone . It propose increase salivary cortisol/cortisone ratio could offer simple convenient diagnostic test AME liquorice toxicity use surrogate marker urinary cortisol/cortisone ratio . The advantage salivary cortisol/cortisone include non-invasiveness make stress free patient , risk needle stick injury ease collection allow potential home test post sample .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Twelve healthy normotensive individual , 20-65 year old , without high blood pressure recruit study . Study individual recruit among hospital staff voluntary basis . The study period consist three phase prior potential volunteer identify : - Phase 1 : Run-in week definition baseline value . - Phase 2 : Six day period daily intake 550 mg Glycyrrhizin 5 day form liquorice confectionary . - Phase 3 : Two week washout period . Phase 1 : The run-in week : - Potential volunteer identify give study information ( participant information sheet ) allow time consider take part . Most volunteer recruit among hospital staff . - Written consent obtain volunteer study investigator . - Volunteers blood pressure , weight height checked assess inclusion exclusion criterion . - The office blood pressure measure 5 min rest . Blood pressure measure two different day run-in period , twice time , mean four measurement use baseline value . - Baseline sample ( take day within run-in week; day -6 , -5 , -4 , -3 , -2 , -1 , 0 ) : - Saliva sample two consecutive day 08.30h 09.30h . - One blood sample 08.30h 09.30h . - One 24h urine sample . Phase 2 : A six day study period ( day 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ) : - Twelve volunteer ingest confectionary liquorice contain 550 mg Glycyrrhizin divide amount day five day . The liquorice , form sugar-free candy , ingest three time per day least 30 minute prior meal morning , afternoon evening . - Volunteers request refrain eating grapefruit drinking grapefruit juice study period . - The liquorice candy weigh give correct dose glycyrrhizin . - Subjects clinically monitor daily liquorice consumption potential side effect , include headache , swell , dyspepsia , dizziness , joint pain , muscle ache , palpitation . - Office blood pressure , heart rate weight measure daily liquorice consumption . - Volunteers collect salivary sample daily 08.30h 09.30h six day . - A blood sample collect day 6 8.30h 09.30h . - A 24h urine sample collect start 8.30h 09.30h complete 8.30h 09.30h day 7 . Phase 3 : At end two week washout period ( Day 19 ) : - Salivary blood sample collect 08.30h 09.30h - A 24h urine sample collect start 8.30h 09.30h day 19 complete 8.30h 09.30h day 20 . - Office blood pressure , pulse rate weight record . In total 40 ml saliva , 30 ml blood three 24h urine sample collect . Labelling saliva , blood urine sample anonymized . Saliva blood sample centrifuge . The separated serum/plasma extract saliva keep frozen -80oC analyse one batch ( minimise analytical variation ) . 24h urine sample volume measure aliquot keep frozen -80oC analyse one batch .</detailed_description>
