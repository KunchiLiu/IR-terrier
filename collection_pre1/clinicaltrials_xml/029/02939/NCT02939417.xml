	<brief_title>One Year Clinical Evaluation E.Max Laminate Veneers With Without Using Grape Seed Extract Natural Collagen Cross-linking Agent Before Bonding</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Justification undertake trial : Ceramic veneer become popular dental procedure since introduction provide excellent esthetics.1 Achieving good esthetic result especially ceramic veneer probably challenge task encounter dental practitioner ceramist today . Ceramic veneer indicate teeth moderate discoloration , restoration traumatize , fracture , worn dentition abnormal tooth anatomy.2 Many factor affect long term success ceramic laminate veneer . The repeated failure pattern associate ceramic laminate veneer fracture , microleakage , colour change detachment restoration.3 The main reason failure large marginal defect fractures.4 The clinical performance ceramic veneer show estimate survival rate teeth prepare butt joint design high teeth prepare palatal chamfer design.5 The bonding technique , time-consuming technique sensitive procedure , key long-term success type restoration . The strength durability bond porcelain , luting cement enamel/dentin interface play important role outcome ceramic veneer , particularly dentin involve . 6 Expected benefit patient 1 . Achieving predictable esthetic restoration conservative . 2 . Increasing long term prognosis restoration . Expected benefit clinician 1 . Enriching professional skill dentist new material improve clinical performance restoration . 2 . Improving confidence patient-dentist relationship . Explanation Choice Comparators Resin cement generally use bond ceramic restoration since provide adequate aesthetic , low solubility oral environment , high bond strength tooth structure , superior mechanical property support ceramic.7 Since retention relies solely adhesion , durable adhesion resin luting cement enamel/dentin cementation surface ceramic crucial . Luting cement use conjunction phosphoric acid etch follow adhesive application enamel show reliable adhesion.8 By study effect incorporation natural cross-linkers primer self-etching adhesive resin-dentine bond strength , positive influence immediate μTBS ( micro tensile bond strength ) mechanical property bond interface.9 Statement problem : Ceramic veneer become popular dental procedure since introduction provide excellent esthetic conservative . However , high failure rate PLVs attribute exposure dentin surface preparation greatly decrease bond strength dentin-cement interface . Natural synthetic cross-linking agent introduce restore dentin function , enhance bonding strength well positively affect remineralization process artificial root . They ability enhance mechanical property stability dentin matrix use PA-rich collagen cross-linkers likely due formation PA-collagen complex.10 Research hypothesis The null hypothesis study wo n't difference clinical performance &amp; adhesion laminate veneer application grape seed extract bonding .</detailed_description>
