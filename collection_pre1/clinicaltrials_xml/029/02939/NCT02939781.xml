	<brief_summary>Fever part body 's immune response , often trigger infection . Fever commonly treat medicine paracetamol , mainly people feel unwell fever . However fever role fight infection : enables rest immune system function efficiently , may directly stop bacteria virus multiply . In case however treat fever matter rest immune system cope well enough fight infection ( without additional treatment , like antibiotic ) . In critically ill patient however advantage fight infection may crucial . In large observational study adult patient intensive care unit , patient develop early fever temperature 38.5-39.5 degree C fare relatively good patient colder . So possible critical illness fever may beneficial . However critical illness body limit energy resource . In order raise body temperature energy require . However investigator know much energy require generate fever critically ill child . This study aim try measure energy require generate fever critically ill child . The investigator measure energy expenditure directly child admit intensive care unit measuring level oxygen carbon dioxide breathe ( method call indirect calorimetry ) . This enable investigator judge whether benefit fever justify energy cost energy deplete state critical illness .</brief_summary>
