	<brief_summary>Patients partially block blood vessel ( ) heart may need medical procedure call `` Percutaneous Coronary Intervention ( PCI ) '' open narrow blood vessel ( ) . The purpose study simultaneously address four potential advance ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction ( STEMI ) care patient least 65 year old . The investigator look see advance improve outcome patient . 1 . Opening artery Medtronic stent 2 . Radial access ( wrist ) success Medtronic stent 3 . Checking percent blockage diseased artery/arteries use Volcano guide wire . 4 . Reduced bleed vascular complication radial arterial access primary PCI STEMI .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Access Site Enhancing PCI STEMI Seniors ( SAFE STEMI Seniors )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multi-center , randomize , open-label , unblinded , active historical-controlled trial approximately 1100 senior undergo urgent PCI least 70 center enrol . All consented subject undergo attempt radial arterial access . For Drug Eluting Stent ( DES ) eligible patient , stable Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction risk score ( TIMI ) -3 flow establish Infarct Related Artery ( IRA ) , patient without randomization exclusion criterion multi-vessel disease randomize 1:1 IRA-only revascularization iFR-guided complete revascularization . After stent implantation , subject contact follow-up 30 day , 1 year , 18 month . Primary endpoint result report subject complete 12 month clinical follow-up . STEMI patient eligible radial access : - DES Eligible single vessel Coronary Artery Disease ( CAD ) receive DES IRA - DES Eligible Multi-vessel CAD randomize 1:1 IRA-only revascularization Instantaneous Wave Free Radio ( iFR ) -guided complete revascularization . - Enrolled subsequently determine DES ineligible follow parallel Base Metal Stent ( BMS ) Registry ( 100 subject )</detailed_description>
