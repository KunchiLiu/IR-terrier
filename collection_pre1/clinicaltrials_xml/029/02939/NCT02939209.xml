	<brief_summary>Arthroscopic shoulder rotator cuff repair associate severe postoperative pain . The interscalene block ( ISB ) commonly use type surgery , provide analgesia anesthetize nerve supply shoulder . Although nerve block provide extremely effective analgesia first 6-8 hour , patient experience severe pain effect regress . This study ass whether single dose oral hydromorphone control release ( CR ) , give overlap wan ISB , improve postoperative pain control reduce incidence rebound pain . Seventy patient undergoing rotator cuff repair receive standardize ISB general anesthesia surgery . Six hour ISB , patient randomly receive either single oral dose 2 mg Hydromorphone ( immediate release formulation ) placebo . The patient discharge home prescription multimodal analgesia , standard care . Patients give diary record pain score track use analgesic medication 24 hour . Twenty-four hour ISB , patient receive phone call nurse per standard care . During phone call , question ask pain control . If single dose pre-emptive hydromorphone demonstrate safe effective , lead change practice manage pain rotator cuff repair . Furthermore , find study may apply similar surgical procedure ( elbow , knee ankle repair ) associate rebound pain nerve block wear .</brief_summary>
