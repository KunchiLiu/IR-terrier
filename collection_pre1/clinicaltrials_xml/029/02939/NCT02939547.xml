	<brief_summary>This research study conduct find whether Trappsol® Cyclo™ , experimental treatment people Niemann Pick disease Type C ( NPC-1 ) safe 2 different dose level effect people condition . NPC-1 cause defect protein important transport fatty substance like cholesterol cell . Without protein , fat build cell ultimately lead organ damage . The way experimental treatment work fully understood laboratory experiment show potentially remove cholesterol build cell people NPC-1 . Approximately 12 patient ask take part research study 20 week ( w ) total ( include screen . treatment follow-up ) . Recruitment expected take 6- 9 months.Patients take part receive treatment intravenous infusion every two week . The study look body drug well drug body take examine blood urine sample . Samples cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) take lumbar puncture follow first subsequent treatment dos . Liver skin biopsy specimen take assess filipin staining . Cholesterol metabolism investigate liver sample splenic hepatic elasticity assess ultrasound..Patients also hear test , ask question doctor well complete questionnaire help assess change condition treatment.This study sponsor funded CTD holding Inc . It plan run USA , .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The plan study design Phase I , double-blind , randomise , single-centre , parallel group study base information data available administration Trappsol Cyclo via compassionate/named patient use patient NPC-1 , data cyclodextrin product scientific literature . The study comprise screen phase 4w treatment phase 12w 4w follow-up The primary objective compare plasma pharmacokinetics single multiple dos two different level IV Trappsol Cyclo .Secondary objective include investigation HP-β-CD effect different dos IV Trappsol Cyclo upon serum lymphocytic marker cholesterol metabolism evaluation Trappsol concentration cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) follow IV administration , evaluation impact treatment upon measure neurological function include ataxia , aphasia saccadic eye movement , impact treatment upon behavioral aspect NPC-1 . It plan recruit total 12 patient study . Patients randomise 1:1 one two dose level ( 1500 mg/kg 2500 mg/kg ; six patient per dose level ) . Treatment administer every two week slow IV infusion 8 hour different concentration achieve proscribe dose level . Patients receive treatment total 12 week . Patients withdraw prior completion initial pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic assessment replace . The design propose study thus enable early assessment potential biochemical marker response allow sufficient dose duration enable short-term effectiveness Trappsol NPC assess . The maximum dose propose study maximum dose long term clinical data available 2 patient ( 2800 mg/kg weekly 3-5 year ) . Although individual clinician always utilized escalate rate infusion , report infusion relate reaction three patient suggest appropriate clinical strategy mitigate risk event consistent dose administration therapeutic agent . In proposed study , treatment administer less frequently undertaken compassionate use . This longer dose interval support nonclinical data compare metabolism cholesterol non-human specie man ; although weekly dose interval initially study man base data mouse , HP-β-CD cholesterol metabolism/turnover mouse 13-fold high man , NPC , likely translate 13-fold slow accumulation cholesterol human cell compare mouse.Therefore , theorize , give slow cholesterol metabolism human , dose interval could much less frequent man mouse ; however , base know cholesterol metabolism human pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic effect HP-β-CD mouse , dose interval 2 week man likely well within therapeutic dosing interval also minimize amount infusion require administer .</detailed_description>
