	<brief_summary>The goal investigation determine , heavy alcohol user , single session transcranial magnetic brain stimulation ( TMS ) brain region involve craving ( medial prefrontal cortex ) brain region involve cogntive control ( dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ) low individual 's crave brain response alcohol cue . This study involve screen visit , follow three visit involve brain imaging ( use functional MRI ) brain stimulation ( use TMS ) . There also additional Magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) exploratory Aim measure concentration glutamate prefrontal cortex session TMS .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Alcohol Use Disorders ( AUDs ) prevalent , devastate , difficult treat . High relapse rate likely due factor affect limbic executive circuit brain , include vulnerability salient cue loss cognitive control . Limbic drive executive control regulate two cortical-subcortical neural circuit -the limbic loop include projection medial prefrontal cortex ( mPFC ) ventral striatum , executive control loop include projection dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( dlPFC ) dorsal striatum . Optogenetic manipulation animal demonstrate causal relationship activity frontal-striatal circuit drink behavior . Consequently , innovative potentially fruitful new strategy treatment AUDs human would selectively attenuate limbic circuitry ( reduce reward salience ) , and/or amplify executive circuitry , target brain stimulation . Previous study demonstrate single session 10 Hz transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) dlPFC lead decrease crave alcohol , nicotine , cocaine . Our laboratory demonstrate single session continuous theta burst ( cTBS ) TMS mPFC also decrease craving , well brain response drug cue cocaine user ( Hanlon et al , review ) alcohol user ( see Significance ) . The overarch goal proposal determine two TMS strategy - amplify dlPFC activity inhibit mPFC activity - efficacious decrease alcohol crave brain response cue . This provide evidence-based foundation cortical target selection future TMS clinical trial - innovative treatment strategy AUD patient . As recent FDA-approved treatment depression , grow interest investigate TMS treatment drug alcohol use disorder . By change frequency pattern stimulation , possible induce long-term potentiation ( LTP ) long-term depression ( LTD ) activity cortical area stimulate well monosynaptic target . To date , nearly publish report brain stimulation tool decrease crave focused apply LTP-like stimulation ( typically 10 Hz ) dlPFC , thereby strengthen executive control circuitry . An alternative approach apply LTD-like TMS ( cTBS ) mPFC , thereby weaken limbic drive circuitry ( engage craving ) . A sham TMS-controlled crossover study 12 heavy alcohol user lab indicate single dose mPFC cTBS decrease self-reported crave BOLD response alcohol cue mPFC striatum ( limbic region involve crave ) . Using MR spectroscopy , demonstrate cTBS-reduced glutamine concentration mPFC , may relate decrease BOLD signal functional connectivity region . Before move forward large expensive multisite clinical trial , important determine cortical target ( mPFC v dlPFC ) likely great effect brain response alcohol cue ( Aim 1 ) , great effect self-reported craving ( Aim 2 ) -a major factor contribute relapse sustain heavy drinking among individual AUDs . In three-visit crossover design , cohort non-treatment seek AUD individual receive sham , mPFC , dlPFC TMS visit follow alcohol-cue induced BOLD imaging MR Spectroscopy . We determine whether LTD-like mPFC TMS effective LTP-like dlPFC TMS : Aim 1 : Reducing alcohol cue-elicited brain activity limbic circuitry . Participants expose well-established fMRI alcohol cue paradigm . We measure percent BOLD signal change within network limbic region typically activate alcohol cue ( e.g . mPFC , ACC , striatum ) ( Schacht et al. , 2014 ) , well functional connectivity region ( use psychophysiologic interaction ) . We test hypothesis 1 ) LTD-like stimulation mPFC ( via cTBS ) LTP-like stimulation dlPFC ( via 10Hz TMS ) significantly decrease alcohol cue-induced activation limbic circuitry compare sham stimulation 2 ) attenuate effect robust stimulation target mPFC directly cTBS stimulation ( rather indirectly via 10 Hz dlPFC stimulation ) . Aim 2 : Reducing self-reported alcohol craving . Using intermittent self-reported assessment desire drink alcohol throughout experimental session ( , , several time point TMS treatment ) , test hypothesis LTD-like stimulation mPFC ( via cTBS ) decrease self-reported alcohol crave LTP-like stimulation dlPFC ( via 10Hz TMS ) . Finally , develop comprehensive evidence-based foundation future clinical trial , also explore effect innovative brain stimulation treatment strategy neurochemistry : Exploratory Aim 3 : Regional neurochemistry . Through MR Spectroscopy , test hypothesis effect TMS outcomes Aim 1 &amp; 2 mediate change mPFC excitatory/inhibitory neurochemical balance ( i.e. , change glutamate , glutamine , GABA concentration ) .</detailed_description>
