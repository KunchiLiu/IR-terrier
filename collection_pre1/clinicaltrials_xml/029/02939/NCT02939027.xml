	<detailed_description>- Rationale : Electronic brachytherapy ( EBT ) offer isotope-free radiation therapy modality treatment specific skin lesion , especially non-melanoma skin cancer ( NMSC ) . Within treatment NMSC , surgical removal lesion currently treatment choice majority case . However estimate 10-15 % NMSC patient , surgery might best treatment option . Location tumour cosmetically sensitive area , patient comorbidities , old age , use anti-coagulation etc . might reason select radiotherapy first choice treatment . - Objective : To determine histologically confirm clinical efficacy , safety , usability Electronic Brachytherapy , innovative treatment Basal Cell Carcinoma ( BCC ) . - Study design : Prospective , out-patient base , single centre , single treatment modality - Study population : 40 patient , &gt; 18 year old , least 1 BCC . Intervention : BCC treat EBT , use low-energy X-rays . Area lesion evaluate tumour presence size , 2 week , 6 week 3 month treatment . If patient one BCC , treat Electronic Brachytherapy large one analyse study . - Main study parameters/endpoints : Local control BCC . - Secondary parameter : Acute skin toxicity , skin cosmesis , care giver satisfaction , patient satisfaction . - Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : Patients expose low-energy X-rays . Required site-visits : 1 pretreatment visit ( intake/informed consent biopsy ) , 6 treatment visit course 2-3 week , 6 control-visits 2 week , 6 week , 3 month , 6 month , 12 month 24 month treatment . - Patients also ask complete short questionnaire evaluate quality life .</detailed_description>
