	<brief_title>Physiotherapy Prehabilitation Patients Undergoing Cardiac Thoracic Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preoperative rehabilitation `` Prehabilitation '' define `` process enhance functional capacity individual enable withstand stressful event '' . Prehabilitation relatively new concept emerge evidence demonstrate reduction length hospital stay disability , improve functional capacity quality life well few peri-operative complication compare usual care . Patients await Cardiothoracic surgery often fearful physically active , however extend period physical inactivity lead loss muscle mass , physical deconditioning pulmonary complication turn lead decrease quality life , high level morbidity , increase hospital length stay even fatality . Based literature support positive effect physical activity , physiotherapy prehabilitation aim enhance functional exercise capacity patient undergo Cardiothoracic surgery hence minimise risk postoperative morbidity enhance postsurgical recovery . Although evidence prehabilitation cardiothoracic specialty mainly within heart failure patient therefore comparable patient undergo CABG lobectomy surgery . The aim study determine whether home base preoperative prehabilitation programme improve patient ' functional capacity , measure 6 minute walk test ( 6MWT ) prior surgery improve post surgical recovery recovery functional capacity earlier . This study compare functional capacity level baseline ( time accept surgery ) day admission surgery . Secondary aim determine functional capacity prior discharge hospital 6-8 week follow appointment . Increasing maximal tidal volume preoperatively would turn decrease chance atelectasis postoperatively thereby decrease pulmonary complication . Time achieve discharge criterion physiotherapy total post-operative hospital length stay assess . Patient health related satisfaction assess use EQ-5D . The endpoint study patient return routine 6-8 week follow appointment complete final 6MWT , tidal volume ( TV ) measurement EQ-5D .</detailed_description>
