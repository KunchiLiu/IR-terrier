	<brief_summary>Since invention electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , ECG important part clinical practice . A primary reason popularity ECG non-invasive perform patient place electrodes skin . The present method ECG record focus detect electrical signal heart . investigator propose high frequency sample high pas filtering , investigator also record SNA skin . The soma subcutaneous sympathetic nerve skin locate ipsilateral cervical stellate ganglion . Because left stellate ganglion nerve activity ( SGNA ) know trigger cardiac arrhythmia , include AF , VF VF , It possible skin SNA also use arrhythmia prediction . investigator test hypothesis preclinical study ( support R01 HL71140 ) use canine model . The result show subcutaneous nerve activity ( SCNA ) record implanted electrode use estimate stellate ganglion nerve activity ( SGNA ) normal dog canine model ventricular arrhythmia sudden death . investigator also show SCNA accurate heart rate variability estimate cardiac sympathetic tone ambulatory dog myocardial infarction.Therefore , SKNA SCNA may useful estimate cardiac sympathetic tone . In addition study autonomic mechanism cardiac arrhythmia , new method may broad application study cardiac non-cardiac disease . For example , sympathetic tone important pathogenesis heart failure , atherosclerosis , peripheral neuropathy , epilepsy , vasovagal syncope , renal failure , hypertension many others disease . Direct SKNA SCNA recording may provide new approach study mechanisms common disease . SKNA recording may also immediate clinical application assist diagnosis treatment hyperhidrosis ( sweaty palm ) , paralysis , stroke , diabetes , neuromuscular disease . It may use assist biofeedback monitoring performed neurologist control neuropsychiatric disorder . Because potential clinical commercial application , investigator propose research project significant . b . Innovation - Using conventional electrode skin record SNA . The neuECG utilizes conventional skin electrode widely use health care facility . Skin SNA record use microneurography technique , estimate use cutaneous blood flow ( vasodilator response ) skin temperature , skin conductance sweat release . However , microneurography use ambulatory patient . The method direct measurement SNA . neuECG first method directly non-invasively measure SNA skin . - Automated real-time signal processing . investigator develop signal processing software automatically eliminate noise , generate muscle contraction , electrical appliance , body motion , respiration , radiofrequency signal . The remain signal process separately display real time provide health care provider new method instantly estimate sympathetic tone . The ECG signal use automate arrhythmia detection SNA signal available risk stratification . This approach allow u improve broaden clinical application Einthoven 's original invention simultaneous detect ECG SNA skin . - SKNA pattern new biomarkers . investigator identify unique SKNA pattern precede onset human AF . If proven correct Specific Aim 3 , new biomarker help physician estimate arrhythmia risk predict efficacy catheter ablation AF .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Cardiac sympathetic innervation come paravertebral cervical thoracic ganglion . Among , stellate ( cervicothoracic ) ganglion major source sympathetic innervation . It constantly connect phrenic nerve almost often vagal nerves.37 The paravertebral ganglion also directly connect spinal nerve , connect intercostal nerve . These intercostal nerve split ramus cutaneous lateralis deep branch musculus rectus abdominis . Histological study human skin biopsy confirm presence abundant sympathetic nerve arteriovenous anastomosis arrector pilorum muscle , arteriole . Using horseradish peroxidase tracer , Baron et al Taniguchi et al find skin sensory sympathetic neuron locate ipsilaterally . The sympathetic soma locate middle cervical stellate ganglion well thoracic ganglion . Because direct extensive connection among various nerve structure , possible sympathetic nerve various structure activate simultaneously . Therefore , investigator hypothesize SKNA record upper thorax use estimate cardiac sympathetic tone . Utilize differential frequency content ECG SNA record neuECG To preserve signal eliminate noise , American Heart Association ( AHA ) standard recommendation low pas filter ECG 150 Hz adolescent adult , 250 Hz child . Higher frequency signal , although know clinically important , routinely eliminate low pas filtering . Because need record high frequency signal , conventional ECG Holter monitoring device wide bandwidth high sample rate . neuECG record take different approach . investigator use equipment wide bandwidth ( 2K Hz ) high sample rate ( 4K/s-10K/s ) record signal skin . The signal band pass 0.5 Hz 150 Hz display ECG signal . The signal high pass &gt; 150 Hz reveal nerve activity . Figure 1 illustrate concept . It show Fast Fourier Transform ( FFT ) analyse signal record skin . High pas filter 150 Hz eliminate ECG signal . The remain high frequency signal may contain muscle nerve activity . McAuley et al report electromyography ( EMG ) usually frequency &lt; 100 Hz . At , small amount muscle activity could reach 400 Hz . By high pas filter 500 Hz , EMG eliminate signal frequency &lt; 500 Hz . The standard high pas set microneurography study 700 Hz . High pas filter 500 700 Hz increase specificity reduce sensitivity SKNA recording . The signal noise ratio reduce . However , basic pattern nerve discharge remain .</detailed_description>
