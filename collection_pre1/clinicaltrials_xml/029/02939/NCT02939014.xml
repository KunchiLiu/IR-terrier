	<brief_title>Brentuximab Vedotin Chinese Participants With Relapsed/Refractory CD30-Positive Hodgkin Lymphoma ( HL ) Systemic Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma ( sALCL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug test study call brentuximab vedotin . This study look efficacy , safety PK brentuximab vedotin Chinese participant relapsed/refractory CD30+ HL sALCL . The study enroll approximately 30 patient . Participants receive : • Brentuximab vedotin 1.8 mg/kg All participant administer IV infusion Day 1 3-week cycle sooner disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , completion 16 cycle . This multi-center trial conduct China . The overall time participate study 3.5 year . Participants make multiple visit clinic , follow overall survival ( OS ) every 12 week death , withdrawal consent , 18 month end treatment ( EOT ) study closure , whichever occur first .</detailed_description>
