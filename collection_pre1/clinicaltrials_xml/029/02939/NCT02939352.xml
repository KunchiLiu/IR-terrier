	<brief_summary>High relapse rate among substance dependent individual likely due combination factor involve limbic circuit brain involve craving , include vulnerability salient cue . Emerging data suggest non-invasive , targeted brain stimulation may able modulate activity circuit decrease craving . The primary goal pilot study determine extent single session continuous theta burst stimulation ( TBS ) medial prefrontal cortex attenuate limbic circuitry involve craving among cocaine user alcohol user . This test double-blind , sham-controlled brain stimulation brain imaging study cohort polysubstance abuser alcohol user .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects Theta Burst Stimulation Brain Response Drug Alcohol Cues</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This parent protocol contain two component - one target cocaine user , target heavy alcohol user ( also serve appropriate control group cocaine user - typically comorbid alcohol use disorder ) . All participant receive one session real one session sham continuous theta burst stimulation ( TBS ) . TBS form non-invasive transcranial magnetic stimulation . sham TMS another visit ( randomize ) . Continuous TBS design low cortical excitability , require short stimulation period typical low frequency transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) . The investigator test hypothesis stimulation medial prefrontal cortex attenuate activity medial prefrontal cortex ( Aim 1 ) , use single pulse TMS magnetic resonance imaging scanner . Through innovative technique possible apply single pulse TMS medial prefrontal cortex model hemodynamic response stimulation site well monosynaptic target region , include striatum . The investigator also investigate effect TBS neural response drug cue ( Aim 2 ) . The result aim correlate self-reported assessment crave throughout experimental visit . These data preliminary data subsequent R01 focus sustained effect multiple session TBS efficacy lower crave extend period time treatment-seekers .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion : nontreatment seek cocaine user ( without comorbid alcohol use disorder ) individual alcohol use disorder , 2555 year old . For cocaine sub study : Cocaine user exclude current use prescription illicit psychoactive drug cocaine marijuana , current past substance dependence criterion cocaine , marijuana , alcohol , smoke &gt; 1 pack cigarette per day , current breath alcohol concentration &gt; 0.002 , lifetime history head injury , history seizure migraine headache ( transcranial magnetic stimulation may exacerbate condition ) , violation magnetic resonance image safety measure . For cocaine sub study alcohol sub study : Drug Screens : A multidrug urine panel give participant screen visit scanning/stimulation visit . In order minimize potential risk session theta burst stimulation , participant must negative urine drug screen stimulant ( include cocaine , amphetamine , methamphetamine ) Scanning/Stimulation visit sign alcohol withdrawal . Based sensitivity test , require participant abstain cocaine use 48 hour prior intervention . While report adverse event transcranial magnetic stimulation cocaine user precaution take psychostimulants know reduce seizure threshold . Participants inform Screening visit . If attend Scanning/Stimulation visit positive urine drug screen , give opportunity reschedule .</criteria>
