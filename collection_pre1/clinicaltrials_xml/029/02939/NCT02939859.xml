	<brief_summary>Purpose study determine safety efficacy use autologous Adipose-Derived cellular Stromal Vascular Fraction ( AD-cSVF ) suspend Normal Saline deliver via intravascular system quality life alteration document Muscular Sclerosis ( MS ) relate neurodegenerative patient . It believe heterogeneous cell population include multipotent stem/stromal cell capable immune modulation/inflammatory modulation property . Exam disease progression quality life change evaluate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) demyelination disease feature damage insulate cover nerve cell brain spinal cord . This damage degenerative change disrupt ability part nervous system communicate , result range sign symptom include physical mental change . Symptoms variable often include visual change , sensory irregularity , motor coordination . MS several form result new symptom either isolated attack ( relapse form ) gradual increase symptom ( progressive form ) . While cause clear , mechanisms suggest association loss immune system failure produce myelin-producing cell . Some suggest genetic predisposition environmental factor , exact causation case elucidate . Medications develop , remain modestly effective possess major side effect poorly tolerate . Alternative treatment , include physical therapy stem/stromal therapy become common . Three main characteristic MS : 1 ) . Lesion formation central nervous system ( call Plaques ) ; 2 ) . Inflammation ; 3 ) . Destruction myelin sheaths neuron . This demyelination think stimulate inflammatory process due action lymphocyte group know T-cell seem recognize patient 's myelin foreign proceeds attack ( know `` autoreactive lymphocyte '' ) . Traditionally , exacerbation 's often treat high dose intravenous steroid may short term reduction symptom , address underlying causation . Current medication available treatment expensive fraught major side effect , make use difficult produce limited measure value . With advent convenient adipose harvest process closed system , ability easily safely acquire significant stem/stromal cell , study underway utilize autologous stem/stromal cell . This study aim evaluation safety profile ( adverse reaction &amp; severe adverse reaction ) close syringe , microcannula harvest subdermal fat deposit . This autologous cell group obtain isolation concentration cell within stromal vascular fraction ( SVF ) via enzymatic digestion , deploy via intravascular route . As cell small , belief able pas cerebral fluid defect blood brain barrier ( BBB ) small enough pas fluid CNS ( central nervous system ) .</detailed_description>
