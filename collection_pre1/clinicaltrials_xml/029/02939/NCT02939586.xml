	<brief_summary>Sleep disturbance significant issue people undergoing dialysis . More 80 % haemodialysis patient complain difficulty sleeping . Inadequate sleep cause poor daytime function increase risk motor vehicle incident . One common reason sleep disturbance dialysis patient sleep apnoea . Sleep apnoea involve pause breathe occur sleep . Each pause last second minute . Severe sleep apnoea reduces oxygen supply increase risk heart attack stroke , leading cause death dialysis patient . In project , investigator examine change dialysis treatment might improve sleep . This project first identify patient risk sleep disturbance use survey subsequent sleep study . The investigator test different dialysis model see effect dialysis treatment sleep apnoea . The aim find dialysis model work well patient sleep apnoea .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sleep Problem Dialysis Patients Sleep apnoea significant issue patient end stage kidney disease . Evidence suggest 80 % dialysis patient sleep apnoea [ 1 ] , yet standard haemodialysis treatment improve symptom sleep disturbance patient [ 2 ] . Sleep disturbance specifically associate poor quality life ( QoL ) [ 4 ] ; decrease mental physical function , adversely impact survival [ 5-7 ] . Recent data also suggest low oxygen state result sleep apnoea exaggerate deterioration kidney function increase risk high blood pressure , cardiovascular abnormality overall death rate [ 8 ] . Despite significance sleep apnoea , acknowledge insufficient evidence clinician manage common symptom burden dialysis population [ 9 ] ; patient receive maintenance dialysis today still experience poor QoL bad survival rate compare common cancer sufferer [ 10 ] . Knowledge Gap It believe mechanism sleep apnoea dialysis patient related overactive chemoreceptor , cause destabilisation respiratory drive periodic breathe night [ 13 ] . Since chemoreceptor trigger inflammatory blood toxin , accumulate kidney failure [ 14 ] , propose good clearance molecule improve symptom outcomes sleep apnoea . These molecule poorly remove standard haemodialysis [ 15 ] thought cause symptomatic effect poor kidney function inflammation , associate poor sleep quality [ 16 ] . Better dialysis treatment may play important role management sleep apnoea . Previous study suggest sleep apnoea may improve nocturnal dialysis ; intensive treatment patient undergo home , sleep , 8-10 hour every night . It provide well blood purification , compare standard haemodialysis treatment . However , nocturnal dialysis home therapy viable majority haemodialysis patient require care clinical setting . There clearly need explore effectiveness dialysis treatment sleep apnoea use different dialysis model . Modern dialysis technology , Haemodiafiltration ( HDF ) , allow well removal toxic molecule beta 2 microglobulin ( B2M ) C-Reactive protein ( CRP ) , standard haemodialysis treatment , may offer benefit nocturnal dialysis dialysis patient . No one examine effect HDF sleep apnoea haemodialysis patient , investigator answer question study . Research Aims 1 . To determine prevalence sleep apnoea local dialysis population use validated questionnaire sleep study . Although sleep apnoea recognise common dialysis population , need reproduce data context local dialysis service accurately identify affected patient 2 . To examine effect HDF compare conventional haemodialysis health status sleep quality patient sleep apnoea , use randomise cross-over trial ( RCT ) 3 . To determine clearance middle-sized uraemic toxin improve symptom sleep apnoea . The middle-sized molecule assess study include C-Reactive protein ( CRP ) , beta 2-microglobulin ( β2M ) , tumour necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-α ) , interleukin 6 ( IL-6 ) , interleukin 8 ( IL-8 ) , serum inflammatory marker commonly find patient obstructive sleep apnoea .</detailed_description>
