	<brief_summary>This research study study combination two drug possible treatment Leptomeningeal Metastases Melanoma . The name study intervention involve study : - Ipilimumab - Nivolumab</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ipilimumab Nivolumab Leptomeningeal Metastases From Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study Phase II clinical trial . Researchers hope study effect combination Nivolumab Ipilimumab . Many cancer use specific pathway ( PD-1/PD-L1 CTLA-4 ) evade body 's immune system . Nivolumab ipilimumab work block PD-1/PD-L1 CTLA-4 pathway thus release brake immune system stop slow cancer . The FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve Nivolumab Ipilimumab treatment option melanoma , approve use cancer cell spread cerebrospinal fluid</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must histologically cytologically confirm disease melanoma Age ≥18 year . ECOG performance status ≤2 ( Karnofsky ≥60 % , see Appendix A ) Life expectancy great 3 week Participants must normal organ marrow function define Table 1 , screen lab perform within 10 day treatment initiation . Adequate Organ Function Laboratory Values System Laboratory Value Hematological Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥1500 /mcL Platelets ≥100,000 / mcL Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL ≥5.6 mmol/L without transfusion EPO dependency ( within 7 day assessment ) Renal Serum creatinine OR Measured calculate creatinine clearance ( GFR also use place creatinine CrCl ) ≤ Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN creatinine clearance ( CrCl ) ≥ 40 mL/min ( use CockcroftGault formula ) : Female CrCl = ( 140 age year ) x weight kg x 0.85 72 x serum creatinine mg/dL Male CrCl = ( 140 age year ) x weight kg x 1.00 72 x serum creatinine mg/dL Hepatic Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X ULN OR Direct bilirubin ≤ ULN subject total bilirubin level &gt; 1.5 ULN AST ( SGOT ) ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 3 ULN OR ≤ 5 X ULN subject liver metastasis Albumin ≥ 2.5 mg/dL Coagulation International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) Prothrombin Time ( PT ) ≤1.5 X ULN unless subject receive anticoagulant therapy long PT PTT within therapeutic range intend use anticoagulant Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time ( aPTT ) ≤1.5 X ULN unless subject receive anticoagulant therapy long PT PTT within therapeutic range intend use anticoagulant Creatinine clearance calculate per institutional standard . Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must use appropriate method ( ) contraception . WOCBP use adequate method avoid pregnancy 23 week ( 30 day plus time require Nivolumab undergo five halflives ) last dose investigational drug . Women childbearing potential must negative serum urine pregnancy test ( minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L equivalent unit HCG ) within 24 hour prior start Nivolumab Women must breastfeed Men sexually active WOCBP must use contraceptive method failure rate le 1 % per year . Men receive nivolumab sexually active WOCBP instruct adhere contraception period 31 week last dose investigational product . Women childbearing potential , ie , postmenopausal surgically sterile well azoospermic men require contraception Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Stable dose dexamethasone 2 mg less 7 day prior initiation treatment Carcinomatous meningitis , define positive cytology Participants chemotherapy , target small molecule therapy study therapy within 14 day protocol treatment , recover ( i.e. , ≤ Grade 1 baseline ) adverse event due agent administer 2 week earlier . Subjects ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy exception criterion may qualify study . If subject receive major surgery , must recover adequately toxicity and/or complication intervention prior start therapy . Participants receive investigational agent . Patients exclude active , know suspected autoimmune disease . Subjects permit enroll vitiligo , type I diabetes mellitus , residual hypothyroidism due autoimmune condition require hormone replacement , psoriasis require systemic treatment , condition expect recur absence external trigger Patients exclude condition require systemic treatment either corticosteroid ( &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent ) immunosuppressive medication within 14 day study drug administration . Inhaled topical steroid adrenal replacement dos &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent permit absence active autoimmune disease . Subjects permit use topical , ocular , intraarticular , intranasal , inhalational corticosteroid ( minimal systemic absorption ) . Physiologic replacement dos systemic corticosteroid permit , even &gt; 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent . A brief course corticosteroid prophylaxis ( eg , contrast dye allergy ) treatment nonautoimmune condition ( eg , delayedtype hypersensitivity reaction cause contact allergen ) permit . As potential hepatic toxicity nivolumab nivolumab/ipilimumab combination , drug predisposition hepatoxicity use caution patient treat nivolumabcontaining regimen . Patients exclude prior systemic treatment antiCTLA4 antibody Has know history active TB ( Bacillus Tuberculosis ) Patients exclude positive test hepatitis B virus surface antigen ( HBV sAg ) hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid ( HCV antibody ) indicate acute chronic infection Patients exclude known history test positive human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) know acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . These participant increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Appropriate study undertake participant receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Has know psychiatric substance abuse disorder would interfere cooperation requirement trial . Is pregnant breastfeeding , expect conceive father child within project duration trial , start prescreening screen visit 120 day last dose trial treatment . Has know additional malignancy progress require active treatment . Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma skin squamous cell carcinoma skin undergone potentially curative therapy situ cervical cancer . Has know history , evidence active , noninfectious pneumonitis . Has active infection require systemic therapy . Has receive live vaccine within 30 day plan start study therapy . Note : Seasonal influenza vaccine injection generally inactivate flu vaccine allow ; however intranasal influenza vaccine ( e.g. , FluMist® ) live attenuate vaccine , allow .
