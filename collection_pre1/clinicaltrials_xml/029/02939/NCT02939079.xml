	<brief_title>Evaluating Effect Fingolimod With Fish Oil Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) chronic autoimmune disease characterize inflammatory demyelinative lesion central nervous system . Relapsing-Remitting MS common form disease observe 85 % patient . This form present acute sub-acute onset neurological symptom patient may fully partially recover relapse may occur time time . Regarding MS pathogenesis , finding suggest role environmental factor trigger innate immune system activate T cell onset chronic inflammatory response myelin antigens central nervous system people genetically prone disease . Among immune cell , T helper 17 ( Th17 ) play important role autoimmune response show involved clinical course Relapsing-Remitting MS. Th17 cell differentiation control several cytokine , include interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) , interleukin-1b ( IL-1b ) interleukin-10 ( IL-10 ) . Also , IL 6 inhibitory effect Th17 cell differentiation increase production interferon-gamma ( IFN-gamma ) IL 10 . Currently , immunomodulatory drug consider first line treatment MS. Fingolimod first oral immunomodulatory medication use Relapsing-Remitting MS . It phosphorylated cross blood-brain barrier convert active metabolite , Fingolimod-P . This metabolite act Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor ( S1PR1 ) oligodendrocytes , microglia , astrocyte , neuron inhibits entry lymphocytes central nervous system . Therefore , reduces demyelination may also lead remyelination . Nutrition known possible environmental factor pathogenesis MS . Positive clinical biological effect dietary supplement contain polyunsaturated fatty acid omega -3 ( PUFA ) course autoimmune disease MS study . High level PUFA find fish oil also know antioxidant , anti-inflammatory immunomodulatory agent . Several study evaluate effect fish oil dietary supplement treatment MS however , conflict finding report . In study , investigator aim evaluate effect Fingolimod Fish oil compare Fingolimod placebo TNF-Î± , IL1b , IL6 , IFN-gamma patient Relapsing-Remitting Multiple sclerosis .</detailed_description>
