	<brief_summary>The goal proposal investigate whether standard rTMS protocol depression , include multiple session apply left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) result reduction depressive symptom adult patient ASD MDD ( Aim 1 ) . The secondary goal investigate whether beneficial reduction core symptom autism ( Aim 2 ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TMS Adults With Autism Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aim 1 . Determine safety therapeutic efficacy left-sided DLPFC high frequency rTMS MDD symptoms patient ASD : The investigator hypothesize patient receive rTMS tolerate treatment course without difficulty clinically significant reduction depressive symptom receive 25 session , compare symptom burden prior initiate TMS . Depression symptom data collect pre- post-TMS score Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HAM-D ) . Depression score also monitor periodically course TMS Patient Health Questionnaires ( PHQ-9 ) . Exploratory sub-aim - Monitoring durability response : The investigator hypothesize subject receive rTMS demonstrate durability response depression symptom reduction , measure HAM-D score 1 month 3 month post-TMS . Aim 2 . Determine effect leave DLPFC rTMS core symptom ASD : The investigator hypothesize subject experience reduction core symptom ASD complete 25 session , compare symptom burden prior initiate treatment . For social communication deficit , informant and/or self-report evaluation make pre- post-TMS Social Responsiveness Scale ( SRS ) , Ritvo Autism Aspergers Diagnostic Scale-Revised ( RAADS-R ) Aberrant Behavior Checklist ( ABC ) . Repetitive restrict behavior evaluate use Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised ( RBS-R ) , ABC , RAADS . Exploratory sub-aim : Determine change functional brain connectivity face object process task via functional MRI imaging patient Autism receive rTMS : The study investigator hypothesize altered brain connectivity evident patient ' baseline fMRI cognitive processing task prior TMS reflect hyper- hypo-connectivity , level normalization pattern fMRI completion TMS series , particularly prefrontal cortex . Exploratory sub-aim - Monitoring durability response : The study investigator hypothesize subject receive rTMS exhibit durability response ASD symptom reduction , measure ABC , SRS , RAADS , AND RBR score 1 month 3 month post-TMS .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis Autism Spectrum Disorder active depressive symptom . List specific contraindicationsUncontrolled and/or untreated seizure disorder define incidence seizure within past 6 month . Patients diagnose epilepsy , prior seizure , allow study take anticonvulsant medication , seizure past year medication . Moderate severe intellectual disability ( ID ) define IQ &lt; 60 , determine prior IQ test Wechsler Abbreviated Scale Intelligence ( WASCII ) prior test result available Other psychiatric neurodevelopmental illness primary area clinical focus ( include limit primary psychotic disorder , substance abuse disorder , ASD ID secondary genetic syndrome ) Active suicidal ideation suicide attempt 90 day prior initial assessment Presence metal implant device head neck ( e.g . metal plat screw ) No participant pregnant plan become pregnant Exclusion criterion fMRI scanning : metal pin , plat clip body orthodontics surgical implant pacemaker cochlear implant permanent makeup tattoo near face head metal fragment body ( weld , shrapnel , BB gun ) suspect fragment claustrophobic pregnant ever suffer closed head injury concussion currently influence alcohol recreational drug smoker currently enrol course PI coI 's instructor understand task instruction lay still mock scanner period 6 minute Inability unwillingness participant legal guardian/representative give inform consent There discrimination exclusion base race , gender , sexual orientation , socioeconomic factor . Of note , male female participant actively equally recruit use method . The natural distribution autism population skew towards significant towards male gender , male prevalence 45 time female prevalence . Our study therefore likely male participant female due trend prevalence . Children ( age &lt; 18 ) exclude study several reason . While autism pediatric neurodevelopmental disorder symptom onset young one year age , also one chronic throughout adulthood . Both child autism neurotypical child undergo period rapid change brain size , structure , organization age , interaction full rTMS series brain still involve period active development may also different point along developmental timeline may skew alter data collect . Additionally , due brain growth increase skull thickness , child different age may significantly different `` scalp cortex '' distance , result different pattern cortical stimulation despite uniform coil positioning . This add , unnecessary variable would compromise attempt perform standardize protocol . Finally , high frequency rTMS FDA approve treatment depression adult , yet FDA approve child adolescent .</criteria>
