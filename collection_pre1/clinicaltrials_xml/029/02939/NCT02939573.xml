	<brief_title>A Randomized Multicenter Study Isolated Skin Vasculitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eligible patient initially randomize ( 1:1:1 ) receive one 3 medication investigation ( colchicine 0.6 mg x 2/day ; dapsone 150 mg/day ; azathioprine 2 mg/kg/day ) 6 month . Endpoint response treatment month 6 ( stage 1 ) . If patient discontinue study drug within 6 month study period subsequent follow-up period ( month 12 ) lack response ( failure ) , flare side effect , he/she randomize receive one remain two study drug ( stage 2 , 1:1 randomization ratio ) 6 month . Endpoint second stage response treatment 6 month .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients primary skin vasculitis , associate significant extracutaneous involvement would require specific immunosuppressive therapy . Eligible patient diagnosis either : Isolated cutaneous small vessel ( SV ) mediumsized vessel ( MV ) vasculitis cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa ( PAN ) IgA vasculitis ( IgA , formerly HenochSchönlein purpura ) , without active and/or progress renal involvement ( stable glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) &gt; 60 ml/min ; absence , mildandstable microscopic hematuria without red blood cell cast ; absence , mildandstable proteinuria ( &lt; 1g/24 hour ) ; require systemic immunosuppressive therapy ) . These condition , skinlimited , currently treat similar manner practice . Mild arthralgia , myalgia , peripheral limb edema , fatigue , weight loss ≤6 lbs 3 kg within past 3 month , lowgrade fever , mild anemia ( Hb ≥ 10 g/dL ) allow . 2 . The diagnosis vasculitis must confirm skin biopsy prior enrollment ( earlier , diagnosis , and/or prior enrollment ) include immunofluorescence study ( case small vessel vasculitis ) . 3 . Patients must active cutaneous vasculitis last least 1 month continuously and/or 2 flare six month precede enrollment ( postinflammatory lesion hyperpigmentation heal ulceration ( ) consider active vasculitis ) . 4 . Patients must active / ongoing cutaneous vasculitis lesion time enrollment ( postinflammatory lesion hyperpigmentation heal ulceration ( ) consider active vasculitis ) . 5 . Patients may contraindication one study drug treat prior enrollment one study medication fail respond ( accord study definition failure drug target dose high 3 month longer ) stop adverse event . Such patient enrol directly second stage study randomize receive one two study drug . The number patient enrol directly stage 2 cap 10 ( 10 % total recruitment target ) . 6 . Patients may receive systemic glucocorticoid cutaneous vasculitis enrollment . For patient prednisone time enrollment , prednisone stop within maximum 6 week enrollment initiation study drug , follow predefined taper schedule . Patients longterm , low stable dose glucocorticoid ( ≤5 mg/day prednisoneequivalent ) condition ( e.g. , asthma adrenal insufficiency ) enrol likelihood require dose increase condition low 6 month study period ( patient remain low stable dose study period , option receive one short course prednisone high dos skin vasculitis flare first 3 month study period , like patient enrol ) . 7 . Participant age 18 year great . 1 . Presence significant extracutaneous manifestation suggestive systemic vasculitis diffuse condition . The presence mild arthralgia , myalgia , peripheral limb edema , fatigue , weight loss ≤6 lbs 3 kg within past 3 month , lowgrade fever , mild anemia [ Hb ≥ 10 g/dL ] exclusion criterion . Mild stable microscopic hematuria without RBC cast and/or mild stable proteinuria ( &lt; 1g/24 hour ) exclusion criterion . These latter patient must require systemic immunosuppressive therapy possible renal involvement GFR must &gt; 60 ml/min . 2 . Known systemic and/or nonskinisolated vasculitis , granulomatosis polyangiitis , eosinophilic granulomatosis polyangiitis , cryoglobulinemic vasculitis , systemic polyarteritis nodosa , central nervous system vasculitis patient detectable antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody ( ANCA ) immunofluorescence ELISA . 3 . Hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis , cryoglobulinemic vasculitis , know secondary skin vasculitides secondary systemic lupus erythematosus , Sjögren syndrome , another autoimmune condition , cancer , hematological disorder , ongoing active infection , ongoing medication . Investigators consider underlie diagnosis perform interpret appropriate laboratory workup indicate base clinical presentation . 4 . History significant intolerance , allergy serious adverse event study medication : patient enrol directly second stage study randomize receive one two study drug . The number patient enrol directly stage 2 study cap 10 ( 10 % ) . 5 . Patients contraindication two three study drug ( azathioprine , colchicine , dapsone ) , treat prior enrollment two three study drug fail respond , stop two three adverse event . 6 . Deficit glucose6phosphate dehydrogenase ( G6PD ) history hemolytic anemia ( patient must test G6PD screen visit assess eligibility ) : patient enrol directly second stage study randomize receive one two study drug ( azathioprine colchicine ) . The number patient enrol directly stage 2 study cap 10 ( 10 % ) . 7 . Low absent thiopurine methyltransferase ( TPMT ) activity ( know , requirement study entry ) : Patients know low absent TPMT enrol directly second stage study randomize receive one two study drug ( dapsone colchicine ) . 8 . Evidence significant hepatic insufficiency liver function test &gt; 2 time upper limit normal . 9 . Evidence significant renal insufficiency creatinine clearance &lt; 60 mL/min . 10 . Evidence significant symptomatic anemia Hb &lt; 10 g/dL . 11 . Comorbid condition moderate high likelihood require intermittent course prednisone within study period , accord investigator ( e.g . chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , unstable severe asthma ) . 12 . Active cancer history malignancy within previous 5 year ( patient remission cancer &gt; 5 year , nonmetastatic prostate cancer treat basal squamous cell carcinoma skin enrol ) . 13 . Active uncontrolled serious infection may compromise contraindicate use study medication . 14 . Patient unable consent . 15 . Pregnant lactating woman .</criteria>
