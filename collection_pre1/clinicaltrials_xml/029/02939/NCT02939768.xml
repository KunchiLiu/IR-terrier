	<brief_summary>Background : Type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM ) characterize destruction β cell consequent loss insulin secretion due autoimmune process , associate increase cardiovascular risk , oxidative stress inflammation . Considering people T1DM reach recommend level physical activity due concern rapid drop blood sugar excuse `` lack time '' , short session exercise provide several benefit encourage . Thus , work aim compare effect high-intensity interval training ( HIIT ) , strength training ( ST ) intervention several blood marker functional parameter T1DM patient . Study hypothesis : ( 1 ) ST+HIIT beneficial HIIT , turn beneficial ST , modification blood level pro anti-inflammatory , pro antioxidant , lipid , renal glucose metabolism parameter ( 2 ) ST+HIIT beneficial HIIT , turn beneficial ST , modification functional parameter , body composition maximal oxygen uptake .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM ) , represent 5-10 % total case diabetes mellitus , characterize destruction β cell consequent loss insulin secretion due autoimmune process . In diabetic patient , micro ( nephropathy , neuropathy retinopathy ) macrovascular ( coronary arterial disease , peripheral artery disease , stroke ) complication major cause morbidity mortality . It recommend diabetic perform least 150 minute ( min ) per week moderate aerobic exercise divide least three day per week , addition perform strength training ( ST ) two day week . Considering people T1DM reach recommend level physical activity due fear hypoglycemia `` lack time '' , short session exercise provide several benefit encourage . Conversely , review study demonstrate session compose ST exercise high-intensity interval exercise ( HIIE ) reduce risk hypoglycemia physical effort , compare continuous aerobic exercise T1DM patient , probably via increase hepatic glucose production transitory inhibition peripheral glucose uptake . The high-intensity interval training ( HIIT ) know improve glycemic control muscular adaptation lipid metabolism type 2 diabetes mellitus patient , although study use model train T1DM individual . Methods : Twenty-seven sedentary T1DM patient ( 18-40 yo ) recruit randomized clinical trial . Volunteers sign informed write consent enrollment study , approve Ethics Committee Federal University Rio Grande Sul . Initially , individual participate control period last four week , ask maintain habitual level physical activity usual eating pattern . After , participant randomize three group : HIIT , ST ST+HIIT , last ten week , train session perform three times/week cycle ergometer and/or weight machine . HIIT protocol consist 10 x 1 min cycling bout perform ~90 % maximal heart rate intersperse 1 min active recovery . ST consist three set perform subject ' 10 repetition maximum load seven exercise . Participants ST+HIIT perform training protocol session . Before control period intervention , submaximal strength test , cardiorespiratory fitness test , 3-day diet record blood draw assessed/performed . Body composition evaluate training period . At 4th week intervention , submaximal strength test cardiorespiratory fitness test assess adjust load . According normality data , pair Student 's test Wilcoxon sign rank test utilized determine difference control period . The homogeneity variance confirm Mauchly 's test , Greenhouse-Geisser correction apply degree freedom sphericity assumption violate . Blood outcomes , maximal oxygen uptake strength value analyze use two-way ANOVA ( 3 condition vs 2 time ) repeated-measures subsequent Bonferroni post hoc analysis require . Statistical Package Social Sciences ( SPSS 19.0 Inc , Chicago , USA ) utilize statistical significance set P &lt; 0.05 .</detailed_description>
