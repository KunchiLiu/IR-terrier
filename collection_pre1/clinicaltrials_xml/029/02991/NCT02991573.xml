	<brief_summary>Damage teeth decay previous old silver filling repair tooth-coloured filling material stick tooth . These material around year become sophisticated ; great ease placement dentist well durability patient . The filling design used combination specific glue ( adhesive ) design stick different part tooth provide good seal , out enamel inner dentine . This study examine performance state-of-the-art modern tooth colour filling material ( Ceram X ) combination exist adhesive ( control adhesive ) new adhesive ( Prime &amp; Bond Universal ) use two different technique ; know work one easy apply . This result three treatment group . At start study , test material Prime &amp; Bond Universal CE-marked , medical device use . Thus , study conduct meet regulatory requirement . The rationale study extension knowledge primarily concern clinical performance Prime &amp; Bond Universal molar . Two investigator ( confirm ) place minimum 25 restoration per group ( 75 restoration total ) ass performance material comparative design . The study restoration monitor period 18 month ( option extend evaluation period 48 month ) . After placement restoration control clinical condition , primary objective study determination post-operative sensitivity pulp vitality , marginal adaptation stain margin restoration . In addition , fracture material retention , recurrent caries , occlusal contour wear , approximal anatomical form determine well failure rate define ADA .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion patient selection : Patients either gender least 18 year old start study ( enrollment ) , seek treatment dental clinic involve , invite participate study need least one eligible Class II posterior restoration permanent molar . Tooth inclusion criterion : Per patient , maximum three Class II restoration include . If three restoration indicate eligible , one material include . Vital , nonsymptomatic permanent teeth Class II lesion suitable inclusion study follow criterion meet : location : first second molar ( ADA guideline [ 1 ] ) ; restoration size : moderate : cusp replacement ; cavity size : occlusal width â‰¥ 1/3 intercuspal distance ( ADA guideline [ 1 ] ) ; cavity outline : preparation include proximal box without occlusal step ; box : cervical outline enamel ; occlusion : least one oppose contact point enamel . Enrollment patient continue specify minimum number restoration per group ( N=25 ) and/or minimum number patient ( N=50 ) reach . Exclusion criteria patient selection : The exclusion criterion ( i.e . contraindication ) describe Instructions Use test , control restorative material apply : Use patient history severe allergic reaction methacrylate resins component ; direct application dental pulp ( direct pulp cap ) . Patients unable give inform consent vulnerable population define ISO 14155 [ 4 ] enrol . Tooth exclusion criterion : As rule , material use situation specify Instructions Use Section Contraindications . direct indirect pulpcapping Furthermore , teeth class II lesion exclude involved inflammation pulpitis ( pain ) , periodontitis probe depth &gt; 6 mm , extraction tooth expect within next 12 month , sign strong parafunctions erosion ( expose dentin occlusal surface and/or wear facet &gt; 6 mm2 )</criteria>
