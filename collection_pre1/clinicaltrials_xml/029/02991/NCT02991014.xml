	<brief_summary>This study aim compare impact listen frequency-modulated music vs. non-modulated music ( researcher-selected ) , test whether differential effect pain stress perception . Further , two condition compare third condition , participant expose self-selected non-modulated music . It hypothesize researcher-selected frequency-modulated music self-selected non-modulated music result strong decrease stress pain compare researcher-selected non-modulated music , expect difference researcher-selected frequency-modulated music self-selected non-modulated music . The intervention consist ten session music listen course three consecutive week .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study aim compare impact three different music listening intervention stress pain parameter . Participants assign randomly one condition . In order avoid expectancy-related effect , participant researcher- self-selected condition tell allocate randomly frequency-modulated non-modulated music . Therefore , subject fully blind regard frequency-modulation . The study design follow : - Baseline measurement : assessment rest state biological parameter questionnaire , CPT - Music listening session : ten session three consecutive week include : 1 . 60 minute music listen 2 . CPT follow music listening ( session 1 , 3 , 6 , 10 ) 3 . Assessments : biological subjective pain stress parameter ; music mood related parameter - Post measurement : assessment rest state biological parameter questionnaire , CPT - Follow-up measurement : 4 week intervention , assessment rest state biological parameter questionnaire , CPT Participants respond health-related question ( chronic stress , stress reactivity , sleep quality , fatigue , menstrual cycle phase ) well mood music-related question baseline , post-intervention , follow-up assess potential outcome , moderator , and/or control variable . In addition , pain stress parameter ( biological subjective ) assess baseline , post-intervention follow-up well course ten music listening session . Furthermore , participant respond specific music mood related item follow music listen session ( e.g . perceive valence , arousal , familiarity , liking , induced emotion , etc. ) . It hypothesize listen researcher-selected frequency-modulated music self-selected non-modulated music result strong increase pain tolerance strong decrease pain intensity baseline post compare listen researcher-selected non-modulated music . Furthermore , strong increase HRV baseline post expect researcher-selected frequency-modulated music self-selected non-modulated music researcher-selected non-modulated music listen condition . Moreover , expect difference researcher-selected frequency-modulated music self-selected non-modulated music regard pain stress parameter . Additionally , test whether change pain parameter moderate change heart rate variability index . Finally , process analysis course music listen session session conduct biological subjective pain stress index well music mood related parameter .</detailed_description>
