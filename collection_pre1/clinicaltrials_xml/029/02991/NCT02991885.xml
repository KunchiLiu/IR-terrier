	<brief_title>HAL-MPE1 Safety Tolerability Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently , effective treatment peanut allergy avoidance peanut allergen . There high unmet medical need disease modify treatment peanut allergy , especially peanut allergic child , since age group high risk peanut-related anaphylaxis require hospitalization . A chemically modify , aluminum hydroxide adsorb peanut extract ( HAL-MPE1 ) subcutaneous administration develop . The safety tolerability HAL-MPE1 establish First-in-human ( FIH ) study adult .</detailed_description>
