	<brief_summary>This study test whether pelvis perturbation training pair transcutaneous spinal direct current stimulation ( tsDCS ) effective improve dynamic balance locomotor function human SCI . One group receive pelvis perturbation training pair tsDCS , one group receive pelvis perturbation training pair sham , one group receive treadmill training .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Improve Dynamic Lateral Balance Humans With SCI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A major goal patient spinal cord injury ( SCI ) regain walk ability , limitation mobility affect activity daily live . In addition , patient SCI may experience high incidence fall due impaired balance gait . Dynamic balance control play crucial role locomotion human SCI . Thus , improved dynamic balance may facilitate locomotion population . Current balance training paradigms effective improve balance standing , less effective improve dynamic balance locomotion human SCI . Thus , need develop new paradigm improve dynamic balance locomotor function patient SCI . The goal study test whether pelvis perturbation training pair transcutaneous spinal direct current stimulation ( tsDCS ) effective improve dynamic balance locomotor function human SCI . We postulate provide perturbation force pelvis treadmill train increase activation muscle use maintain lateral balance walking . Further , repeat activation particular sensorimotor pathway may reinforce circuit synapsis use lateral balance control use-dependent neural plasticity mechanism . However , excitability spinal cord neural circuitry may depress due reduce descend drive signal upper level control center SCI , may reduce efficacy neuralplastic change achieve follow rehabilitation . The excitability neural pathway crucial neural reorganization achieve follow rehabilitation . Recently study indicate tsDCS may modulate excitability neural circuitry spinal cord patient SCI . Thus , postulate control pelvis perturbation training pair tsDCS effective pair sham improve dynamic balance locomotor function human SCI . Results obtain study lead innovative clinical therapy aim improve balance walk function human SCI . Improvements balance walk function may allow increased participation community-based ambulation activity , significantly improve quality life human SCI .</detailed_description>
