	<brief_summary>In July 2016 , demand yellow fever vaccine response large urban outbreak occur concurrently risk spread African continent even Asia , large available supply . In situation , World Health Organization ( WHO ) develop recommendation use fractional-dose yellow fever vaccine dose-sparing strategy . These recommendation base limited number clinical trial additional study assess applicability fractional dose WHO-prequalified vaccine , persistence neutralizing antibody performance fractional dose young child population Africa include HIV . This study aim respond research question would allow broaden recommendation use fractional dos yellow fever vaccine emergency situation . The study conduct Uganda Kenya main objective ass non-inferiority seroconversion 28 day vaccination fractional dose compare full dose WHO-prequalified manufacturer . As secondary objective study assess seroprotection 10 day 1 year vaccination , assess rapidity persistence protective antibody level ; describe geometric mean titre change neutralize antibody Day 28 day vaccination fractional full dos ; assess occurrence adverse event serious adverse event ( SAE ) 28 day administration fractional full dos . The study consist randomize non-inferiority trial . The study aim start April 2017 two site aim recruit 960 adult . Results main outcome review study Data Safety Monitoring Board one vaccine select study child HIV positive adult .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immunogenicity Safety Fractional Doses Yellow Fever Vaccines ( YEFE )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Yellow fever ( YF ) mosquito-borne viral disease endemic 34 country African region 14 South America . YF virus infection asymptomatic cause wide spectrum disease , mild symptom severe , potentially lethal illness jaundice , renal failure haemorrhage . The vast majority report case death occur sub-Saharan Africa yellow fever major health problem occur epidemic pattern . There specific treatment yellow fever infection . However , YF vaccine show effective outbreak control well prevention outbreak . YF vaccination confers protection vaccinate individual consider life-long . In 2016 , YF outbreaks occur Africa ( Angola , Democratic Republic Congo ( DRC ) Uganda ) well South America ( Brazil , Colombia Peru ) . Factors increase urbanization poor area without proper water sanitation system population movement , potential contribute increase incidence yellow fever large epidemic . In July 2016 , demand yellow fever vaccine response large urban outbreak occur concurrently risk spread African continent even Asia , large available supply . In situation , World Health Organization ( WHO ) develop recommendation use fractional-dose yellow fever vaccine dose-sparing strategy . This strategy consist deliver 1/5th conventional dose use vaccinate 7 million people Kinshasa , capital city DRC . The evidence recommend use fractional dosing base limited number clinical study . However consider sufficient provide emergency recommendation . In order broaden also possibly simplify WHO recommendations fractional dose use case need emergency campaign , additional data need respond important data gap . These include applicability fractional dose WHO-prequalified vaccine , persistence neutralizing antibody performance fractional dose young child population Africa include HIV . Following data gap , WHO call research conduct . This study aim respond research question would allow broaden recommendation use fractional dos yellow fever vaccine emergency situation . The study conduct Uganda Kenya main objective ass non-inferiority seroconversion 28 day vaccination fractional dose compare full dose manufacturer . As secondary objective study assess seroprotection 10 day 1 year vaccination , assess rapidity persistence protective antibody level ; describe geometric mean titre change neutralize antibody Day 28 vaccination fractional full dos ; assess occurrence adverse event serious adverse event ( SAE ) 28 day administration fractional full dos . The study aim recruit 960 adult ( 480 Mbarara , Uganda , 480 Kilifi , Kenya ) . Results main outcome review study Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) result consider satisfactory , study continue recruitment child HIV infect adult , assess non-inferiority one WHO prequalified vaccine .</detailed_description>
