	<brief_title>Expansion COPD At-risk Module 4 States BRFSS Telephone Health Surveys</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives : The primary objective study determine prevalence health-related characteristic adult high risk COPD , never diagnose . The second objective study determine frequency type respiratory symptom general adult population among 4 state . The third objective describe respiratory symptom adult population relationship chronic disease COPD , asthma , obesity others . The fourth objective engage state add Module BRFSS early 2017 aid effort decrease burden COPD . Procedures : The COPD At-risk Module incorporate 4 state 's 2015 BRFSS telephone health survey ( SC , TX , FL , KY ) . The COPD At-Risk Module derive previously publish COPD case-finding population screen questionnaire . The 4 question contain Module : 1 ) How many year smoke tobacco product ? ( ask say smoke &gt; 100 cigarettes/lifetime , part core survey ) , 2 ) In last 30 day , often short breath ? 3 ) How often cough mucus phlegm ? 4 ) In last 12 month , extent would say physical activity limit shortness breath ? One additional question , age year , already contain BRFSS , combine 4 question , allow estimation survey participant 's risk COPD . The COPD risk category : 1 ) diagnose COPD ( self-report provider diagnosis COPD ) , 2 ) high risk COPD ( self-report frequent respiratory symptom base participant response plus least 10 year tobacco product use ) , 3 ) low risk ( neither diagnose COPD high-risk group ) . Each state 's BRFSS group ( state government epidemiology department ) undertake BRFSS telephone survey begin January 2015 part normal annual state-based health surveillance . The core BRFSS survey develop CDC minor change core survey may occur year . Individual state often additional state-specific question request outside organization individual , do study . The study investigator request receive approval add `` COPD at-risk Module '' consist 4 question add 70-plus sociodemographic health characteristic question already include BRFSS . Per CDC guideline , potential survey respondent may refuse participate answer question survey . Using scripted BRFSS , train interviewer collect data use independent probÂ¬ability sample household landline cellular telephone non-institutionalized person . Based past BRFSS survey , participant response rate decline ~ 60 % ~ 50 % due inclusion cell phone along landline begin 2011 . According CDC , inclusion cell phone landline phone well represent general adult population , especially young adult . A detailed description survey 's design random sample procedure available BRFSS Policies , Procedures , Protocol Document , 2013 . The BRFSS approve exempt research CDC 's institutional review board . Study Population It project ~ 45,000 non-institutionalized adult ( &gt; 18 year ) complete 2015 BRFSS telephone health survey among 4 participate state - KY , SC , TX , FL . These 4 state represent significant segment COPD population US base upon prior COPD prevalence estimate COPD-related hospitalization among Medicare recipient . Of note , Kentucky high prevalence COPD US . For state , cell phone landline phone randomly select base pre-determined goal geographics socio-demographics per state CDC procedure . Hispanics also participate telephone survey interpreter . Only one adult household contact complete survey . Of potential survey respondent , one-half provide complete data telephone survey . Data Collection Confidentiality Collection survey data participant start January 2 , 2015 complete end 2015 . Prior state analyze release survey data 2016 , CDC undertake internal review state 's survey data May 2016 . Data file state CDC share outside investigator contain PHI . After state review analyze survey data , available release public upon request , include investigator study .</detailed_description>
