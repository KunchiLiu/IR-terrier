	<brief_summary>This study prospective multi-center trial design determine safety profile efficacy modest ( 33ºC ) intravascular hypothermia follow acute cervical ( C1 C8 ) Spinal Cord Injury ( SCI ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Systemic Hypothermia Acute Cervical Spinal Cord Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose propose clinical trial demonstrate safety efficacy intravascular hypothermia part early hospital management treatment acute cervical SCI . Each year US , 11,000 new case para- quadriplegia 100,000 new case partial permanent neurological loss due acute SCI . Thus potential clinical hypothermia follow SCI improve neurological outcome significant value . Many patient suffer SCI become permanently dependent caretaker become financial liability family society . Hypothermia potential improve outcome patient suffer SCI regain independent motor sensory function remain economically productive member society . The use modest hypothermia intravascular cooling may ultimately lead good care patient acute SCI may also widespread us patient present stroke cardiac arrest . In long-term , research may lend support use hypothermia could turn save money patient , hospital , government society whole .</detailed_description>
