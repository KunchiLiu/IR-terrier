	<brief_summary>Cancer remain major cause morbidity mortality post solid organ transplantation . While mortality lead cause death post-transplantation ( e.g . cardiovascular disease infection ) decline , mortality cancer post-transplantation increase . This due general transplant-specific risk factor combine increase risk cancer compare general population . However , shortage research explore cancer epidemiology post solid organ transplantation UK . This essential guide clinician counsel patient regard expectation outcomes develop cancer post-transplantation . This especially important aetiology , pathophysiology outcome cancer post-transplantation may differ general population . Available data registry UK separately contain valuable cancer transplant-specific data combine explore cancer epidemiology post-transplantation comprehensively , directly translate patient benefit utilizing transplant-specific data ( rather translate general population non-UK patient demographic ) . The purpose project combine exist data resource link complete patient journey solid organ transplant recipient focus entire spectrum cancer incidence mortality .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Epidemiology Cancer After Solid Organ Transplantation - EPCOT Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Solid organ transplantation associate increased incidence cancer versus general population , broadly par comparable immune deficiency state HIV/AIDS . The aetiology cancer post-transplantation primarily due burden immunosuppression compulsory transplant patient prevent allograft rejection . Skewed standardise incidence ratio observe cancer post-transplantation compare general population , preponderance cancer strong viral component . The literature cancer-related mortality transplantation scarce , disparate mortality risk document compare solid organ transplant recipient general population . There shortage UK-specific data guide transplant clinicians best deal cancer . This important country differ regard ethnic demographic post-transplant immunosuppression protocol , important confounders translate data transplant cohort . Collett colleague previously publish registry data cancer incidence British transplant recipient ( link UK Transplant Registry various national cancer registry ) cohort transplant 1980 2007 . They find similarity also important difference cancer incidence British solid organ recipient cohort versus registry data Sweden , Finland , Canada United States . Importantly , relevance data contemporary solid organ transplant cohort unclear , immunosuppression protocol evolve since 2007 predominantly tacrolimus-based regimen since publication SYMPHONY study 2007 . No subsequent analysis do determine impact tacrolimus introduction cancer occurrence post-transplantation UK . Previous work analyse cancer-related mortality UK , provide data site cancer-related mortality stratify analysis along demographic factor age , gender and/or ethnicity relevant British population . This analysis link two different national data resource study Collett colleague - Hospital Episode Statistics Office National Statistics . It demonstrate crude cancer-related mortality rate England ( 2001 2012 ) 361 cancer-related death per 100,000 person year ( compare 424 416 cardiovascular- infection-related death respectively ) . Of note , cancer-related mortality within first year post kidney transplantation ( 7.4 % ) show rise incidence increase time post-transplantation ( 22.0 % beyond first year post kidney transplantation second lead cause death ) . This previous work identify strengths limitation utilise data resource . One major limitation registry data absence important relevant information confound data , overcome link data registry . For example , previous analysis identify kidney cancer account half cancer-related mortality kidney transplant recipient history pre-transplant cancer . However , limitation data inability probe association number important issue ; 1 ) location kidney cancer ( whether native transplant kidney ) , 2 ) whether pre-transplant cancer kidney-related , 3 ) time dialysis pre-transplant ( strong risk factor acquire cystic renal disease malignant transformation ) . While information unavailable isolate data set , information contain within national data resource could combine data linkage create broad comprehensive epidemiological resource . Data record linkage define `` process pairing record two file try select pair belong entity . '' Cancer data routinely collate transplant center robust mechanism explore cancer epidemiology data post solid organ transplantation UK Transplant Registry . However , link information exist data registry resource facilitate analysis . This under-researched area within transplant cancer community , increasingly important due increase incidence prevalence cancer post solid organ transplantation .</detailed_description>
