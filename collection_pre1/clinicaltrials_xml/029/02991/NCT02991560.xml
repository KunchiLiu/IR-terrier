	<brief_title>Effects Various Taping Techniques Lateral Epicondylitis Functional Ultrasonographic Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lateral epicondylitis ( LE ) , also know tennis elbow , overuse injury cause elbow pain , difficult treat . It characterize frequent pain sensitivity lateral section elbow , mostly extensor tendon ( extensor carpus radialis brevis [ ECRB ] ) origin extensor digitorum communis [ EDC ] muscle . It estimate annually occur 1 % -3 % adult individual worldwide . There consensus regard etiology ; however , associate repetitive movement , smoking , factor increase physical load , obesity . In recent study , workplace use non-naturally position elbow wrist associate elbow pain . In addition , repetitive microtraumas know trigger injury . Pain primary complaint LE patient . Pain increase activity , become acute injury trauma . LE associate decreased extensor muscle strength variation biomechanics ; however , matter debate whether variation cause result LE . In pathophysiology , three interact component , namely local tendon pathology , change pain system , loss motor function report . Recent study highlight , rather inflammatory condition , tendinosis ( chronic symptomatic degeneration tendon ) occur forearm common extensor muscle tendon adhere lateral epicondyle humerus . Ultrasound evaluation indicate various tendon pathology , tendon thickening , focus hypoechogenic zone , tendon laceration , calcification . LE may heal usually respond conservative treatment . In case conservative treatment inconclusive , surgical method may opt . Several conservative method among treatment option LE , rest , nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) , injection treatment , exercise , physiotherapy program involve manual therapy technique , massage , brace , deep friction message , extracorporeal shockwave , low level laser therapy , low frequency electrical stimulation , electrophysiological agent . The use non-elastic tap technique approach utilized conservative treatment LE exist report examine instantaneous effect muscle strength , grip strength , pain ; however , indicated study warrant show effectiveness tap . Kinesio Taping速 , involve elastic tape , rather recent technique use orthopedic injury addition physiotherapy , gain popularity . Even though report indicate effect adhesive tape muscle grip strength LE patient , effectiveness could compare treatment modality several reason , instantaneous effect lack control group . The literature review show , due structural difference athletic tape Kinesio Tape速 , athletic tap application rather adopt control movement joint pain , support non-contractile structure , ligament capsule , stability . Studies utilize non-elastic tape treatment LE inadequate examine effect acute period lack comparison . On hand , observe Kinesio Tape速 mostly use functional support , muscular facilitation , myofascial relaxation , study focus management lateral epicondylitis scarce . The aim present study , LE patient , compare short-term effect two different tap technique addition intense physiotherapy program severity pain , grip strength , functional status , joint limitation , structural change tendon indicate diagnostic USG</detailed_description>
