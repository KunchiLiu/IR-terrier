	<brief_title>A Prospective Observational Study Evaluating CGVHD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease represent first cause transplant-related mortality reduce quality life transplant ( HSCT ) . The epidemiology Chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease largely unknown ; moreover , diagnosis Chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease easily miss onset often late post-transplant period , require specific follow , general practitioner usually familiar entity . Successful treatment Chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease represent unmet clinical need field allogeneic transplantation . Steroids standard treatment , 60 % patient require second-line treatment standard second-line treatment Chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease steroid refractory . To help standardise management Chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease , NIH Consortium propose consensus definition diagnosis , score response criterion 2006 revise 2015 offer share framework study rare disease . These criterion yet validate thus suitable clinical trial . This study prospective , observational , multicentre , spontaneous , non-interventional study evaluate consecutive patient develop chronic graft-versus-host disease , report Italian GITMO center accord standardized Web platform real-time , on-site data collection . The platform data collection base software prototype develop Ancona Transplant Center management patient Chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease . This software integrate algorithms automatically determine : severity Chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease overall response 2015 NIH consensus criterion . Historical control compare Chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease incidence , toxicity , response rate hard outcome use . The aim project evaluate prospectively long-term effectiveness different therapy hard outcome `` failure free survival '' commonly consider reliable one . The failure free survival result number factor influence treatment failure show reliable predictor long-term survival . Main cause failure change immunosuppressive treatment although recurrent disease , treatment toxicity mortality Chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease ( infectious complication ) also contribute failure free survival . Second , aim evaluate prognostic ability late NIH response criterion predict main hard survival outcome assess suitability tool decision-making ultimately lead treatment change . Finally , aim evaluate feasibility use electronic tool data collection daily clinical practice .</detailed_description>
