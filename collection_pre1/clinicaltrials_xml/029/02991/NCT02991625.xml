	<brief_summary>Drugs use manage chronic pain proven effective chronic pain continue cost Canadians $ 60 billion year without truly help suffer . The study propose investigate factor related person enhance reduce effectiveness pain treatment people suffer chronic pain . Treatment response pain killer person may relate brain , genetics , social , psychological makeup . The investigator aim study factor identify develop feasible robust indicator base person 's biological makeup ( also call biomarkers ) . These biomarkers allow doctor researcher predict accurately treatment prevention strategy particular disease work group people . These measure offer new opportunity improve treatment tailor treatment meet specific need patient base his/her biological psychological makeup . Towards specific aim , data first collect several experimental domain study treatment expectation ( cognitive , psychosocial , brain-related , genetic ) . These 'experimental ' data compare chronic back pain ( CBP ) healthy participant yield new understanding factor govern treatment response . At end experimental data collection , investigator collect data 'clinical ' domain . Hence , end experimental session , subset CBP participant receive mock drug ( placebo disguise approve pain treatment ) another subset provide pain rating hence serve wait list control placebo trial . Data study step understand factor mediate treatment outcome finally investigator use advanced computational tool use big data analysis aim identify factor use biomarkers precision medicine tool .</brief_summary>
