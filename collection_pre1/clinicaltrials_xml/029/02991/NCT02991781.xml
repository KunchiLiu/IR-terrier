	<brief_title>Combined Bio- Neuro- Feedback vs. Varenicline Use Smoking Cessation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study develop experimentally test efficiency neurofeedback ( NF ) training protocol smoke cessation . As non-pharmacological , non-invasive painless brainwave technique , NF contribute teach individual take control mind operant conditioning . NF regulate brain function natural way . Studies report 80 % rate reduce eliminate need traditional medication14 . Therefore , nicotine substitute ( varenicline ) may carry toxicity risk factor may become redundant . The protocol include 5 bio- 25 Neuro-feedback session , last approximately 36 month . The electrophysiological evaluation efficacy intervention include EEG rest state multifeature Mismatch Negativity ( MMN ) evoke response measurement participation human volunteer . These data analyze term cortical activation pattern cortical connectivity . Questionnaires use collect behavioral psychometric data regard smoking related behavior . Additionally , clinical evaluation include spirometry , exhale carbon monoxide , total antioxidant capacity , vitamine E , cotinine conduct . The data collect prior , , completion study one-year follow . The Neurofeedback intervention compare different group participant follow intervention base varenicline use approximately 3 month . The electrophysiological evaluation efficacy intervention include EEG rest state sleep polysomnography measurement . Questionnaires clinical evaluation include measurement neurofeedback intervention 3 time point : prior , , completion study .</detailed_description>
