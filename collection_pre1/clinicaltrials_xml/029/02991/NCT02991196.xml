	<brief_summary>This trial perform two part : Dose Escalation Dose Expansion . The primary objective Dose Escalation part determine safety tolerability different dose DS-8273a administered combination nivolumab identify dose combination Dose Expansion cohort subject mismatch repair ( MMR ) -proficient advance colorectal cancer . The primary objective Dose Expansion part : - To evaluate safety tolerability DS-8273a administer select dose combination nivolumab subject MMR-proficient advanced colorectal cancer - To evaluate preliminary anti-tumor activity DS-8273a plus nivolumab administer select dose subject MMR-proficient advance colorectal cancer</brief_summary>
