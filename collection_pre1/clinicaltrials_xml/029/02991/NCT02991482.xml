	<brief_title>PembROlizuMab Immunotherapy Versus Standard Chemotherapy Advanced prE-treated Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mesothelioma aggressive malignancy usually affect surface body coelomic cavity . It commonly originate pleura propensity lower parietal pleura costo-diaphragmatic recess , almost always cause asbestos exposure , usual lag time 30 year exposure presentation . Outcomes patient invariably fatal , median survival presentation around 9-12 month series due difficulty achieve complete microscopic surgical resection tumour relative chemo-refractoriness . Whilst initially consider rare , due demand asbestos variety associate industrialization follow Second World War , background incidence mesothelioma 1/million risen 40/million country . In UK , substantial asbestos exposure continue 1970s , death rate high world current epidemic new case , predict continue another 5-10 year . Two main histological subtypes mesothelioma identify . The epitheliod subtype commonest , account around 40 % case , whilst sarcomatoid subtype observe 20 % case ; latter typically aggressive chemorefractory . Around 35 % case feature epitheliod sarcomatoid subtypes term biphasic subtype . For patient pleural mesothelioma , surgery consider appropriate , systemic chemotherapy ( platinum combine pemetrexed ) remain international standard care . Cisplatin/pemetrexed associated response rate 41 % confers OS advantage 3 month cisplatin alone , license systemic therapy mesothelioma Europe . Despite , median survival 9-12 month series unresectable case . At relapse , platinum-based chemotherapy , anti-cancer systemic therapy license . Whilst several small phase II study retrospective series suggest potential efficacy chemotherapy agent include carboplatin/gemcitabine , vinorelbine , none thus far demonstrated efficacy benefit randomise study , median PFS rate report 3 month gemcitabine vinorelbine . There therefore huge unmet need effective therapy patient relapse pleural mesothelioma . The large trial ever perform systemic therapy relapse pleural mesothelioma 661 patient documented natural outcome group relapse mesothelioma patient , report median OS 27.1 week ( 6 month ) median PFS 6.1 week ( 1.5 month ) placebo . Programmed cell death-1 ( PD-1 ) co-inhibitory molecule immunological synapse act major regulator adaptive immunity , exploit tumour cell result adaptive immune resistance ( tolerance ) . This occur PD-1 bind ligands PD-L1 ( B7H1 ) PD-L2 , express many tumour type . High PD-L1 expression tumour associate poor outcome . Mesothelioma show express PD-L1 , small study identify PDL1 expression 40 % mesothelioma . Moreover , immunologically-mediated inflammation know key driver mesothelioma development via Nalp3 imflammasome . Pembrolizumab ( MK-3475 ) potent highly selective humanize monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) IgG4/kappa isotype design directly block interaction PD-1 ligands , PD-L1 PD-L2 . There need identify new way systemic therapy malignant mesothelioma immune checkpoint inhibition promise way forward . Results propose trial contribute overcome tumour-specific immune suppression immune checkpoint inhibition .</detailed_description>
