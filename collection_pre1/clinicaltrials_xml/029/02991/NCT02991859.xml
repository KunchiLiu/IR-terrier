	<brief_summary>This randomize , placebo-controlled , 2-period crossover , escalate repeat dose study , aim investigate whether high potency different inhale corticosteroid confers improvement topical efficacy systemic activity ratio asthmatic subject . It compare dose response topical efficacy via airway responsiveness ( adenosine-5'-monophosphate [ AMP ] challenge ) , dose response systemic activity via 24 hour plasma cortisol suppression , thereby compare relative therapeutic index , follow inhaled corticosteroid : fluticasone furoate ( FF ) , fluticasone propionate ( FP ) budesonide ( BUD ) . There screen visit 7-28 day first dose study treatment , minimum 4-day run-in period first dose study treatment . Subjects randomize one 12 treatment sequence , two treatment period , comprise 5 consecutive 7-day phase escalate dos either FF , FP , BUD placebo . There 25- 42-day washout period treatment period . The study duration subject approximately 22 week include follow-up period .</brief_summary>
