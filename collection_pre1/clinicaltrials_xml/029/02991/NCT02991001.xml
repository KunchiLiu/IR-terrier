	<brief_summary>Carpal tunnel syndrome ( CTS ) common peripheral entrapment neuropathy involve compression median nerve carpal tunnel . Rather progressive disease , CTS characterize remission recurrence . The hydrodissection could decrease entrapment nerve restore blood supply . Despite hydrodissection pervasively use clinical practice , current research contain small participant without control group randomize lead foreseeable selection bias . The investigator design randomize , double-blind , control trail ass effect ultrasound-guided hydrodissection patient CTS .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>After obtain write informed consent , patient bilateral CTS randomize intervention control group . Participants intervention group receive one-dose ultrasound-guided hydrodissection control side receive one-dose ultrasound-guided injection subcutaneous layer beyond carpal tunnel . No additional treatment injection study period . The primary outcome visual analog scale ( VAS ) secondary outcome include Boston Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Questionnaire ( BCTQ ) , cross-sectional area ( CSA ) median nerve , sensory nerve conduction velocity median nerve , finger pinch strength . The evaluation perform pretreatment well 2nd week , 1st , 2nd 3rd month treatment .</detailed_description>
