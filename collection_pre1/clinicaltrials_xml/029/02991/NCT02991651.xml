	<brief_summary>Patient selection : ) Pathological confirmation non-small cell lung cancer without activate EGFR mutation ; b ) Advanced stage disease ( IV IIIB malignant effusion ) least two prior chemotherapy regimen ; c ) No available curative therapy ; ) Pregnant woman exclude ; e ) Informed consent . Pretreatment evaluation : ) Medical history physical examination ; b ) Hepatic renal function ( bilirubin , aspartate aminotransaminase , creatinine ) ; c ) Preoperative stag evaluation include CT-chest PET/CT scan ; Treatment plan : Three dose level IRX4204 erlotinib study use intra-patient dose escalation dose level 1 2 . These study agent administer orally progression disease , unacceptable toxicity , activation phase II study combination , exhaustion IRX4204 drug supply . Evaluation study : Adverse event grade scale 0 5 , use Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) v. 4.0 .

	<brief_title>Study IRX4204 With Erlotinib Previously Treated Advanced NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Numerous study pre-clinical model human clinical trial clearly establish potential use rexinoids treatment prevention cancer . IRX4204 , second generation rexinoid , highly potent specific activator RXRs . Because IRX4204 significantly potent selective RXRs relative RARs first generation approve RXR agonist drug , bexarotene , potentially associate few adverse event great activity clinical use . Preclinical study combination IRX4204 plus erlotinib , previous clinical study combination bexarotene plus erlotinib indicate least additive beneficial effect treatment NSCLC . This study seek investigate safety activity IRX4204 combination erlotinib patient previously treat advanced NSCLC .</detailed_description>
