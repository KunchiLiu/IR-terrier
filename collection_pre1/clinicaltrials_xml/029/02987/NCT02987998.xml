	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine feasibility evaluate safety deliver chemoradiotherapy , usual approach non-small cell lung cancer , combination pembrolizumab ( MK-3745 ) , follow consolidation pembrolizumab surgical resection . Consolidation therapy treatment give follow initial treatment . Pembrolizumab investigational drug ( also know Keytruda ) , approve FDA use certain type skin cancer ( melanoma ) , use certain type head neck cancer . However , approve use cancer non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . Pembrolizumab monoclonal antibody bind surface cell immune system activate cancer cell . It chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant Chemoradiation Plus Pembrolizumab Followed By Consolidation Pembrolizumab NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary hypothesis addition pembrolizumab neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiation , follow consolidation pembrolizumab , safe feasible deliver patient resectable stage 3A Non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . This study also plan observe efficacy combination overall biomarker-positive population . Primary Objective Primary objective phase 1 study determine safety feasibility MK3475 standard care therapy chemotherapy radiation newly diagnose stage 3 lung carcinoma . • To define Safety , tolerability feasibility MK3475 combination chemotherapy cisplatin etoposide along 45 Gy radiation newly diagnose stage 3 non-small cell lung carcinoma . Secondary Objective ( ) - Progression Free Survival - Objective response rate , - Complete pathologic response rate , - Nodal downstaging surgery , - Overall survival , - Safety tolerability Correlative Objective ( ) Exploratory objective : Overall response rate , progression free survival , overall survival Programmed death-ligand ( PDL-1 ) positive versus negative subgroup Study Design This open-label , single arm phase I trial neoadjuvant chemotherapy + pembrolizumab concurrent radiation follow surgical resection consolidation pembrolizumab resectable stage 3A ( N2+ ) NSCLC . Eligible patient biopsy-confirmed T1-3N2M0 ( stage IIIA ) non-small cell lung cancer ( adenocarcinoma , squamous cell carcinoma , large cell/NSCLC otherwise specify ) , performance status 0-1 , adequate lung function deem medically resectable thoracic surgeon , adequate organ function chemotherapy , contraindication pembrolizumab ( i.e . autoimmune disorder underlie pulmonary fibrosis ) . Because pembrolizumab safely add multiple platinum doublet chemotherapy regimens lung cancer yet test set concurrent radiation , plan evaluate safety feasibility combination therapy . 10 patient enrol full start dose 3 agent . If 3 ( &gt; 30 % ) grade 3 high pulmonary toxicity grade 4 nonhematologic toxicity , study stop . If 2 few &gt; grade 3 pulmonary toxicity &gt; grade 4 nonhematologic toxicity , additional 10 enrol . If 5 few ( &lt; 25 % ) 20 patient &gt; grade 3 pulmonary toxicity &gt; grade 4 nonhematologic toxicity , regimen deem safe feasible study .</detailed_description>
