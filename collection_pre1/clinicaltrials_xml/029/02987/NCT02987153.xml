The primary objective evaluate response rate pain control combine kyphoplasty , minimally invasive procedure , single dose intraoperative radio- therapy ( IORT ) treatment spinal cord metastasis . Secondary objective ( . ) determine feasibility unstable potential unstable spine metastasis ; ( ii . ) determine tolerability/side effect IORT within 90 day post-procedure ; ( iii . ) determine clinical factor prognostic vertebral compression fracture</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Kypho-Intra Operative Radiation Therapy ( IORT ) Localized Spine Metastasis , Phase I/II Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 20 % patient spine metastasis present unstable lesion , represent common therapeutic dilemma patient advanced stage cancer limit survival time . Management necessitate spinal stabilization surgery laminectomy , vertebroplasty , kyphoplasty mechanical back pain control irradiation underlie malignant process . Because limited survival time patient metastatic cancer , novel , convenient treatment concept shorten overall treatment time hospitalization desirable . We develop novel approach combine kyphoplasty , minimally invasive procedure , single dose intraoperative radio- therapy ( IORT ) treatment spinal cord metastasis . Patients treat Kypho-IORT receive prescribe dose 8 Gy 1 fraction The Intrabeam® Photon Radiosurgery System source . The target volume include tumor . The technique operation delivery radiotherapy describe publish previously . TARGiT Academy train requisite test case complete prior enrol subject study . The balloon kyphoplasty , advancement vertebroplasty , treatment option fracture vertebral body utilize bone cement provide need support . Outcome measure include complete partial pain relief stable response index site require increase narcotic pain medication . Therefore , patient complete partial pain relief consider responder . Patients complete partial pain relief index site progressive response secondary site ( ) consider non-responders . Quality Life Measurements . It hypothesize quality life ( QOL ) improve Kypho-IORT due rapid durable pain control spine treatment . In current study , measure QOL [ EORTC QLQ-C30 ( version 3 ) ] , Brief Pain Inventory ( BPI ) , ambulation , steroid narcotic use pre- post-procedure 1-week , 3-month , 6-month , 9-month , 1-year , 2-year interval . The involved spine image 3-month interval one year , 2 year post-procedure . All evidence date support description Intrabeam deliver accurate reliable dose . Physicists site responsible verifying miniature x-ray source operational prior use set parameter within control console software treatment delivery . During procedure , control console monitor system safe accurate dose delivery .</detailed_description>
