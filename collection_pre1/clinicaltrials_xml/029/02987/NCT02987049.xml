	<brief_title>Intensive Cardiac Rehabilitation ( ICR ) : Tolerability Effectiveness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Conventional Cardiac Rehabilitation ( CR ) involve 36-session supervise monitored exercise treatment program cardiac rehabilitation facility patient approve cardiac diagnosis , chronic angina , recent myocardial infarction ( heart attack ) , cardiac surgery , recent percutaneous coronary intervention . The exercise session generally one hour treatment period typically 12 week . Intensive Cardiac Rehabilitation ( ICR ) include 36-session exercise intervention plus 36 one-hour educational session Pritikin program . These education session include one-on-one dietary consultation register dietitian , nutrition workshop cook class lead registered dietitian , series Pritikin video , notebook Pritikin handouts various topic , include read nutrition label , prepare heart-healthy meal , mindfulness , smoke cessation , process atherosclerosis . Nathan Pritikin start Pritikin program 1970s aim decrease recurrent cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) event human . The three pillar Pritikin lifestyle program healthy diet , exercise , mindfulness . The Pritikin diet emphasize unprocessed food high fiber , low calorie density , low sodium , saturate fat , cholesterol . Mindfulness include behavior modification therapy smoke cessation stress management . Since 1970s , 100 publication scientific , peer-reviewed journal demonstrate efficacy program improve many traditional cardiac risk factor biomarkers cardiac health , well prevent treat CVD . In addition , low-fat , high fiber diet combine exercise show improve marker nitric oxide bioavailability fast insulin concentration . Most result , however , derived study patient domicile Pritikin wellness center . Relatively recently , Pritikin program approve form ICR outpatient set . The BJC/Washington University School Medicine Cardiac Rehab program Heart Care Institute first Cardiac Rehab program world offer outpatient Pritikin ICR program . Currently , Medicare ( ) third-party insurance company pay ICR . Thus , many patient age 65 year afford potential benefit ICR . SPECIFIC AIM : The purpose study fill gap knowledge tolerability effectiveness outpatient , Pritikin-based ICR program traditional cardiovascular risk factor , exercise performance , patient well-being ( assessed questionnaire ) , well monitor subsequent clinical event outpatient population . HYPOTHESIS : The hypothesis patient Intensive Cardiac Rehabilitation ( ICR ) group great improvement several cardiovascular risk factor patient conventional Cardiac Rehab ( CR ) group end 24 session . FUTURE DIRECTIONS : If result study favorable , several implication clinical practice . 1 ) Evidence effectiveness tolerability outpatient ICR encourage expand coverage ICR cardiac patient may benefit treatment future . 2 ) Demonstration trend improvement outcome would support need multi-center trial define degree ICR help patient decrease health care-related cost . These question would explore future R34 grant Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute ( PCORI ) grant . STUDY OVERVIEW : This 2-year , non-randomized study Intensive Cardiac Rehab ( ICR ) conventional Cardiac Rehab ( CR ) treatment program already conduct part routine clinical care cardiac rehabilitation facility . Many assessment conduct outcome measure study obtain part exist cardiac rehab program . Assignment ICR CR group accord refer physician 's recommendation insurance coverage occur study enrollment . The research portion obtain permission include participant ' phenotypic outcome data research study database analyze information systematic manner answer study question regard tolerability effectiveness ICR program . Participants also ask complete additional assessment questionnaires research purpose .</detailed_description>
