	<brief_summary>Total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) one painful orthopedic procedure . After TKA surgery , postoperative pain relief may achieve use variety technique . Integral recovery improve outcomes early ambulation mobilization . Achieving adequate postoperative pain control ensure ability ambulate early quite challenge . Currently , country call address prescription opioid use abuse due nationwide opioid epidemic . In light , improve multimodal analgesic protocol serve decrease reliance opioid medication pain control . Multimodal analgesia effective decrease total opioid consumption postoperatively . Dextromethorphan low-affinity noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor antagonist . It long history clinical use establish safety record . Studies show positive effect analgesic . In order see dextromethorphan decrease opioid use , study look two patient group undergo total knee arthroplasty preoperative , intraoperative , postoperative anesthetic plan exception addition dextromethorphan one group multimodal analgesic regimen . This study design double-blinded , randomize , prospective cohort trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dextromethorphan Use Multimodal Analgesia Regimens Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Each subject receive part standard care spinal sedation intraoperative anesthesia . Subjects randomly assign use computer generate allotment . The group designation place sealed envelope . The group list determine whether receive dextromethorphan part preoperative preincisional analgesic regimen . Only pharmacist dispense medication unblinded . The drug placebo conceal pharmacist deliver patient ingest preoperative area . Group A : standard preop med Group B : standard preop med + dextromethorphan The standard preoperative analgesic regimen include placement adductor canal catheter nerve block , acetaminophen 1000mg PO , oxycodone extend release 10mg PO , celecoxib 400mg PO ( hold elevate creatinine ) , pantoprazole 40mg PO All block perform resident trainee supervision anesthesia regional acute pain attending . The continuous adductor canal nerve block place use B-Braun `` Contiplex Continuous Peripheral Nerve Block Tray '' , use 20g catheter . Intraoperative anesthesia perform spinal injection use local anesthestic . No opioid give intrathecally . Intraoperative sedation include standard sedation propofol infusion . Postoperative nausea vomit prophylaxis include ondansetron , propofol infusion , dexamethasone 0.1mg/kg contraindicate . The postoperative recovery room pain protocol include follow : start adductor canal catheter infusion `` On-Q '' pump dispense ropivicaine 0.1 % 4ml/hr , oxycodone 5 10mg po moderate severe pain , dilaudid 0.2mg IV q5min 2 mg , ketorolac 30mg intravenous ( IV ) , acetaminophen 1000mg intravenous great 6 hour elapse since initial preoperative dose . Assessments pain use VAS pain score perform postanesthesia care unit ( PACU ) time spinal block cessation blind observer ( recovery room nurse ) , subsequently every 4 hour register nurse document electronic medical record . Initial evaluation resolution spinal blockade perform 1 hour timepoint PACU . Assessments opioid administration , include medication give document electronic medical record . The various time point analyze include intraoperative , PACU , daily postoperative morphine equivalent administer patient . Postoperative followup do research personnel blind group distribution . Visual Analog Scale Pain ( VAS Pain ) perform every 4 hour discharge . On postoperative day ( POD ) # 1 , patient give Quality Recovery ( QoR ) Questionnaire . This recovery specific , patient rat questionnaire contain 40 item measure 5 dimension . The QoR 40 specifically design measure patient 's health status surgery anesthesia , completion time generally range 3 10 min . The five dimension measure include : physical comfort ( 12 item ) , emotional state ( nine item ) , physical independence ( five item ) , psychological support ( seven item ) pain ( seven item ) . The total score subscales QoR 40 measure use five point Likert scale ( positive item : 1 = none time , 5 = time ; negative item , score reverse ) individual score add together , minimum score 40 point maximum score 200 point . In addition , study require home follow phone call assess occurrence possible side effect complication , pain , postoperative opioid use . These phone call occur POD # 3 discharge , POD # 7 , POD # 14 , POD # 28 . Each phone assessment require 5 minute time . Authorized research personnel study project make phone call .</detailed_description>
