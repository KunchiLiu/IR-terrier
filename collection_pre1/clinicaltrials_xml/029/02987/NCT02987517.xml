	<detailed_description>SUBJECT ENROLLMENT When potential participant contact ( contact investigator ) , screen phone email ensure meet study inclusion exclusion criterion . If , detail study procedure explain give opportunity ask question take much time require decide would like participate . In addition , consent obtain , subject undergo initial screening treadmill run ensure foot strike cadence inclusion criterion meet . Before study begin , participant provide write consent form give opportunity ask question . Prior initiation initial screening , data collection , treatment , participant must sign consent form . Participants randomly assign via computer one two treatment condition : 1 ) increase cadence run gait 2 ) forefoot strike run gait . STUDY PROCEDURES Subjects 13 visit Spaulding National Running Center screening , intervention , biomechanical analysis . Each visit outline : Visit 1 ( 2.5 hour ) determine subject us habitual heel strike cadence less equal 170 , color vision test measure subject 's weight , height , leg length , arch height Baseline biomechanical analysis instrument treadmill Physical therapist-researcher instruct strengthen exercise foot legs Subjects tell perform exercise daily keep journal 4 week Visit 2 ( 30 minute ) One week exercise instruction , subject meet physical-therapist researcher review perform strengthen exercise voice question concern Visits 3-10 ( 1 hour ) Gait retrain treadmill use auditory feedback ( metronome cadence Noraxon system forefoot strike ) verbal instruction physical therapist . These visit distribute 2-3 week time period . Subjects may run 2 day row , never 3 day row . Visit 11 ( 1 week final gait retrain ) ( 2 hour ) Measure subject 's rest heart rate , weight , height , leg length , arch height Biomechanical analysis run gait instrument treadmill Biomechanical analysis run gait instrument treadmill either 85-90 percent age predict heart rate reach Borg Rating Perceived Exertion score great equal 17 reach . Subjects instruct use REDCap secure web application journal run frequency distance ( mile ) , discomfort injury occur run next 6 month . Visit 12 ( 1 month final gait retrain ) ( 2 hour ) Measure subject 's weight , height , leg length , arch height Biomechanical analysis instrument treadmill Remind subject continue keep journal Reminder via email phone call Physical therapist-researcher contact subject 1 time per month next 5 month remind continue keep journal running frequency distance ( mile ) , discomfort injury occur . Visit 13 ( 6 month final gait retrain ) ( 2 hour ) Measure subject 's weight , height , leg length , arch height Biomechanical analysis instrument treadmill The outcome measure may include combination follow : Structural measure : Height , weight , leg length , arch height . Video analysis : Digital video record waist . Motion analysis : recording 3 dimensional movement use computerized system reflective marker attach body high-speed camera . Ground reaction force : gather force sense platform embed treadmill Impact : accelerometer attach body record impact experience body footstrike . Devices use The data collect use 3D motion capture ( Vicon Motion Systems ) conjunction 2 force plate ( AMTI ) , embed treadmill . Other device use foot caliper arch height , digital metronome , accelerometer auditory feedback ( Noraxon ) . These minimally invasive procedure involve attach sensor marker skin record output sensor . ) Procedures/interventions All study procedure take place Spaulding National Running Center Instrumented Treadmill Lab clinic . Biomechanical Analysis All biomechanical analysis run gait take place Treadmill Lab use instrument treadmill ( AMTI ) 3D motion analysis system . Four biomechanical analysis conduct duration investigation . These occur baseline , 1 week final gait retrain session , 1 month follow gait retrain , 6 month follow gait retrain . Procedures analysis follow : Subjects run 3 minute warm allow adjust speed preference . An investigator control treadmill speed , participant investigator stop treadmill anytime via emergency stop button . After warm , data collection occur 4000 frame ( 15-20 step ) . To minimize prevent laboratory performance effect , subject distract data record . The distraction technique base Stroop Color Word Test , involve subject read aloud word screen directly front treadmill . The correctness test interest ; rather , serve distraction technique . Fatigue run One week final gait retrain session , subject ask run feel fatigue . Fatigue define either follow two criterion : subject reach 85-90 percent age predict heart rate max report score great equal 17 Borg Rating Perceived Exertion scale . Once fatigue reach , data collect 4000 frame ( 15-20 step ) . Strengthening exercise During first visit , physical-therapist investigator instruct subject strengthen exercise foot leg . These activity prepare musculoskeletal tissue adapt new force experience gait retrain . Subjects instruct perform exercise daily 4 week , give journal record exercise performance . One week exercise instruction , subject meet physical therapist-investigator review strengthen exercise report question concern . Gait Retraining There 8 gait-retraining session 2-3 week time period . Subjects randomly assign either increase cadence gait forefoot strike gait . The gait retrain protocol conduct treadmill ( Woodway ) clinic Spaulding National Running Center follow manner : Increased cadence ( CAD ) Protocol : After 3-minute warm , subject ' preferred step rate determine self-selected moderate intensity run additional 3 minute use visual count footstrikes . Subjects ask increase normal cadence 7.5 percent maintain speed . This accomplished subject match footstrikes beat audible digital metronome . Forefoot strike ( FFS ) Protocol : Subjects wear accelerometer right anterior distal tibial . After 3-minute warm run , subject continue run additional 3 minute baseline rearfoot strike accelerometer value record . Next , subject instruct land gently ball foot low heel ground . They guide verbal cue visual inspection physical therapist . A forefoot strike accelerometer value record . If value exceed , device provide audible feedback heel strike detect signal runner land FFS pattern . For group , run time gradually increase 10-30 minute 8 session . The auditory feedback provide constantly first 4 session gradually decrease systematic manner last four session . This feedback schedule produce successful outcome number gait retrain studies.4,5,6 The feedback schedule group detail follow : Session 1 - 10 minute treadmill run metronome auditory feedback 100 percent time Sessions 2,3,4 - Time run gradually increased session 2,3,4 12 , 15 , 18 minute respectively . Auditory feedback 100 percent time . Sessions 5,6,7,8 - Time run gradually increased session 5,6,7,8 21,24,27 , 30 minute respectively . Auditory feedback gradually reduce give beginning , middle , end run . This 4 minute session 5 ; 3 minute session 6 ; 2 minute session 7 ; 1 minute session 8 . Participants instruct run time outside gait-retraining period . After completion gait retraining , subject encourage continue new gait pattern run independently community . They instruct increase run distance great 10 percent per week reach desire run duration distance . Subjects ask keep journal run activity gait retrain return final gait analysis . This do via REDCap ( Research Electronic Data Capture ) secure web application . Data collect data collect : Biomechanical outcome describe collected 5 biomechanical analysis participant attend Spaulding National Running Center . Every effort make accommodate participant ' schedule session . Data collection occur first visit ( baseline ) , 1 week follow gait retrain ( approximately 7 8 week baseline ) , 1 month gait retrain ( approximately 11 week baseline ) , 6 month gait retrain ( approximately 35 week baseline ) . Journals daily strengthen exercise performance collect Visit 3 ( 4 week baseline ) . Journals run frequency distance discomfort injury collect throughout 6 month follow period use REDCap secure web application ( 9 35 week baseline ) .</detailed_description>
