	<brief_title>Leiden Trial In Prevention Post-Operative ThromboEmbolic Events</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It clear thrombo-embolic prophylaxis mandatory neurosurgical intervention . The current prophylactic strategy use preoperatively start low molecular-weight heparine ( LMWH ) allow still considerable number thrombo-embolic complication , particular patient subject prolonged neurosurgical intervention . Guidelines advise mechanical prophylaxis . However , guideline base literature low grade evidence . To achieve high grade evidence randomize subsequent patient intermittent compression stocking preoperative LMWH prophylaxis , LMWH stand alone prophylaxis . The last , current state practice neurosurgical patient ward , include high thrombosis risk group . All patient receive preoperatively start LMWH . There high degree diversity attribute risk thrombosis neurosurgical patient cohort . Due diversity , insufficient power perform study lack careful phenotyping description risk factor previous study deep venous thrombosis ( DVT ) prophylaxis , yet optimal DVT prophylaxis neurosurgery remain unclear . A prospective randomized study adequate power detail information patient relate factor ( malignancy , subarachnoid haemorrhage , prevail coagulopathies ) , type surgery , duration surgery , postoperative immobilisation allow u identify optimal treatment strategy high risk neurosurgical patient . In current study patient fulfil inclusion criterion subject post-operative systematic evaluation venous thromboembolic event ( VTE ) echo-duplex investigation . • 2 . Goal study The primary goal current study investigate whether combination perioperative intermittent pneumatic compression LMWH low incidence postoperative thrombo-embolic complication within week high risk neurosurgical intervention comparison patient receive merely LMWH prophylaxis . Secondary research question : - Is difference number patient clinical symptom thromboembolus patient receive combination peroperative intermittent pneumatic compression lower limbs LMWH comparison patient receive merely LMWH prophylaxis high risk neurosurgical patient , score two month surgery ; - What prevalence VTE high risk neurosurgical patient Leiden University Medical Centre ( LUMC ) receive LMWH prophylaxis ; - What risk factor prevalence VTE high risk neurosurgical patient LUMC ; - What incidence bleed complication high risk neurosurgical patient LUMC receive LMWH prophylaxis ; - Is difference length hospital stay patient receive combination peroperative intermittent pneumatic compression lower limbs LMWH comparison patient receive merely LMWH prophylaxis high risk neurosurgical patient ; - Is difference patient perceive recovery discharge 2 month follow patient receive combination perioperative intermittent pneumatic compression LMWH comparison patient receive merely LMWH prophylaxis high risk neurosurgical patient ; - Is difference Quality life discharge 2 month follow patient receive combination perioperative intermittent pneumatic compression leg LMWH comparison patient receive merely LMWH prophylaxis high-risk neurosurgical patient ; - Is relevant consider cost-effectiveness use perioperative intermittent pneumatic compression leg , cost-effectiveness ? - 3 . Randomized controlled trial This randomize controlled trial high-risk neurosurgical patient University hospital ( see inclusion exclusion criterion ) consecutive patient meet inclusion criterion invite participate trial . Clinical demographic data gather , well surgical detail prevail complication . Postoperative bleed require secondary surgery lengthening hospital stay document clinically relevant bleed complication . All patient receive Fraxiparine 2850 IU ( international unit ) daily , start preoperatively compatible current practice . At admission patient randomize subjected perioperative ( 48 hr ) intermittent pneumatic compression standard care . Following current guideline LUMC Fraxiparine dose double 5600 IU patient weight 100 kg . All randomized patient receive postoperative doppler examination major vein low limb order identify possible VTE . A post-operative thrombo-embolic complication define follows7 : 1 . Asymptomatic VTE confirm echo Doppler ; 2 . Symptomatic VTE confirm echo Doppler ; 3 . Symptomatic pulmonary embolism ( PE ) confirm CT scan 4 . Fatal pulmonary embolism confirm autopsy - 3.1 Population The neurosurgical patient increase risk thrombo-embolic complication subject intervention general take long time cause patient immobilized long period ( directly surgery ) . Moreover , pathology frequently carcinomatous , increased risk thrombo-embolic event nature . The in- exclusion criterion aim property patient . All consecutive patient fulfil criterion invite participate study . In order include patient sign inform consent . Based power analysis 140 patient randomization arm include ( base VTE incidence 15 % decrease 5 % treatment intermittent pneumatic leg pump surgery ; alpha 0.05 , power 80 % ) able obtain significant effect .</detailed_description>
