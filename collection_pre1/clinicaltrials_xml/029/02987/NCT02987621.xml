	<brief_summary>In project investigator use non-invasive brain stimulation people multiple sclerosis ( PwMS ) improve leg muscle function . Two group participant recruit . One group perform strength test without brain stimulation . After complete strength test participant walk six minute see increase strength translate improve mobility . The second group participant perform fatigue task , pull wire low level force , without brain stimulation . This type brain stimulation show transiently improve strength fatigue measure population , e.g . age , Parkinson 's , improve cognitive ability people multiple sclerosis . It investigator 's hope increase performance see patient group also occur people multiple sclerosis . Future investigation look apply non-invasive brain stimulation technique physical rehabilitation improve short long term outcomes related physical function .</brief_summary>
