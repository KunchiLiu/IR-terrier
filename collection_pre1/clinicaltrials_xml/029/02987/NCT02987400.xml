	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate clinical activity tolerability combination obinutuzumab plus venetoclax patient relapse refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Obinutuzumab Venetoclax Relapsed Refractory DLBCL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study 6 patient run-in phase determine safety adjust treatment . Once sixth patient complete 21 day treatment , withdrawn due toxicity , die , formal review undertaken sponsor ( AGMT ) . Enrolment halt review complete . If one ( 1 ) treatment relate death report three ( 3 ) patient experience CTC grade 4 event neutropenia , anemia , thrombocytopenia , study stop recruitment . If stop criterion meet , enrollment continue . A futility analysis conduct first 10 patient evaluate response : If least 2 patient objective response ( CR PR ) , study continue . The combination treatment repeat 3 cycle . The first response assessment ( include PET-CT ) perform first cycle obinutuzumab-venetoclax patient least stable disease ( SD ) good give another 2 cycle therapy assessment total 3 cycle . Patients complete partial remission ( CR , PR ) 3 cycle therapy either go transplant receive 9 cycle combination therapy ( transplant ineligible ) . Patients progressive disease time-point stable disease 3 cycle take study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diffuse large Bcell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) histologically confirm relapse within 12 month achieve PR CR initial Ranthracycline containing therapy , refractoriness initial Ranthracycline containing therapy ( achieve least partial response ) Bcl2 protein expression detect immunohistochemistry . Adequate organ function , At least one bidimensionally measurable lesion CT scan define &gt; 1.5 cm long dimension . Confirmed availability archival freshly biopsied tumor tissue meeting protocoldefinedspecifications prior study enrolment . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance Status 0 , 1 , 2 . Adequate hematologic function ( unless cause underlying disease , establish extensive bone marrow involvement result hypersplenism secondary involvement spleen lymphoma per investigator ) Patient receive investigational treatment within 28 day study entry . Known hypersensitivity recombinant protein , murine protein , excipient contain drug formulation obinutuzumab venetoclax . DLBCL transform malignancy CD20 negative DLBCL . Radiation , chemotherapy , immunotherapy anticancer therapy ≤ 4 week prior Cycle 1 Day 1 . Ongoing corticosteroid use &gt; 30 mg/day prednisone equivalent . Patients receive corticosteroid treatment ≤ 30 mg/day prednisone equivalent must document stable dose least 4 week duration prior randomization ( Cycle 1 Day 1 ) . Patients may receive brief ( &lt; 7 day ) course systemic steroid ( ≤ 100 mg prednisone equivalent ) prior initiation study therapy control lymphomarelated symptom . ECOG performance status ≥ 3 . Female patient pregnant breastfeeding . Acute uncontrolled chronic infection . Known diagnosis HIV Known cerebral meningeal disease ( HL etiology ) , include sign symptom PML . Symptomatic neurologic disease compromise normal activity daily live require medication . Any sensory motor peripheral neuropathy great equal Grade 2 . Known history follow cardiovascular condition : myocardial infarction within 2 year study entry , New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class III IV heart failure , evidence current uncontrolled cardiovascular condition , include cardiac arrhythmia , congestive heart failure ( CHF ) , angina , electrocardiographic evidence acute ischemia active conduction system abnormality , recent evidence ( within 6 month first dose study drug ) leftventricular ejection fraction &lt; 50 % . Diagnosed treat another malignancy within 3 year first dose previously diagnose another malignancy evidence residual disease . Patients transform lymphoma . Primary CNS lymphoma . Vaccination live vaccine within 28 day prior treatment . History malignancy could affect compliance protocol interpretation result ( Patients history curatively treat basal squamous cell carcinoma Stage 1 melanoma skin situ carcinoma cervix eligible ) . Patients malignancy treat surgery alone curative intent also exclude , unless malignancy document remission without treatment ≥ 3 year prior enrollment . Evidence significant , uncontrolled concomitant disease could affect compliance protocol interpretation result could increase risk patient . Significant pulmonary disease ( include obstructive pulmonary disease history bronchospasm ) . Known active bacterial , viral , fungal , mycobacterial , parasitic , infection ( exclude fungal infection nail bed ) study enrollment , major episode infection require treatment IV antibiotic hospitalization ( relate completion course antibiotic ) within 4 week prior Cycle 1 Day 1 . Requires use warfarin ( potential drugdrug interaction may potentially increase exposure warfarin ) . Received follow agent within 7 day prior first dose venetoclax : CYP3A inhibitor fluconazole , ketoconazole , clarithromycin Strong CYP3A inducer rifampin , carbamazepine Consumed grapefruit , grapefruit product , Seville orange ( include marmalade contain Seville orange ) star fruit within 3 day prior first dose venetoclax . Clinically significant history liver disease , include viral hepatitis , current alcohol abuse , cirrhosis . Presence positive test result Hepatitis B , Hepatitis C CMV .
