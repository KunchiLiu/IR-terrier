	<brief_summary>Premature birth major risk factor perinatal brain damage cerebral palsy ( CP ) 47 % CP case occur infant birth weight less 2500 g. CP life-long neurological consequence affect quality life patient . In last 2 decade , improvement neonatal intensive care improve survival VLBW infant significantly . This increase survival VLBW infant pose new challenge towards develop novel treatment intervention decrease neurodevelopmental impairment CP . While common extremely preterm infant survive 23 week gestation , neurologic consequence range learn difficulty cognitive defect severe disability cerebral palsy . Currently prenatal neuroprotective agent corticosteroid utilize whenever preterm birth anticipate . However , proven postnatal intervention prevent brain damage cerebral palsy VLBW infant . Many recent study show delay umbilical cord clamping ( DCC ) may improve hemodynamic stability decrease intraventricular hemorrhage ( IVH ) preterm infant . A decrease incidence IVH conceivable prospective benefit decrease brain injury improve long-term outcome . Based finding , American College Obstetricians Gynecologist American Academy Pediatrics endorse DCC may benefit preterm infant . However , recommendation adopt obstetrician USA . The main concern regard practice DCC care delay initiate resuscitation provide need care vulnerable population . Therefore , alternative DCC , method cord milking ( CM ) develop provide cord blood transfusion premature infant . CM offer practical alternative delay cord clamping may provide benefit without need delay resuscitation . However , study CM VLBW infant evidence demonstrate long-term neurological outcome CP CM . The investigator hypothesize cord milking VLBW infant result improve cerebral oxygenation , function result improve long-term neurodevelopmental outcome 2 year post-menstrual age . Premature infant bear less equal 32 week gestation age receive cord milk cut versus standard care immediate cord clamping .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary Aims To Measure : 1 . Cerebral oxygenation function ( aEEG abnormality ) first 24 hour life 2 . Neurodevelopmental outcomes 18 - 24 month PMA Secondary Aims 1 . Assessment Improved transition : Delivery room resuscitation , Apgar score , acidosis cord gas first hour blood gas 2 . Neurological injury assessment : IVH/PVIH/PVL head ultrasound day # 3-5 day # 7-14 , 36 wk PMA , MRI 36 wk CGA 3 . CVS response : Blood pressure ionotropic support first 3-5 day 4 . Hematological assessment : Hemoglobin , Hematocrit admission , first 72 hour life , need phototherapy high bilirubin level first 7 day , blood transfusion need till 36 wk PMA 5 . Gastrointestinal protection : Necrotizing enterocolitis till 36 wk PMA In pilot study , plan enroll 15 VLBW infant group ( n=30 ) Mattel Children 's Hospital Santa Monica Hospital labor delivery . Data pertain primary secondary aim obtain EMR . Follow utilize Bayley 's score infant development ( BSID III ) schedule 18-22 month PMA</detailed_description>
