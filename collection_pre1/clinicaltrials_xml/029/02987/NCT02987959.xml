	<brief_summary>This open-label phase II study TAK-228 patient ≥ 18 year age complex genomic sarcoma exhibit Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase ( PI3K ) pathway dysregulation . Patients must surgically unresectable metastatic disease refractory least one prior line therapy ( include neoadjuvant adjuvant therapy curative setting ) . Patients disease must also evidence progression prior enrollment . The purpose study determine antitumor activity group patient . Patients must meet eligibility criterion detailed section 10 . A total 33 patient include study . Patients undergo screen evaluation determine eligibility within 28 day first dose . All patient require submit baseline tumor sample analysis . Patients tumor test commercially PI3K/ AKT/mechanistic Target Rapamycin ( mTOR ) alteration assess case case basis eligibility determination whether additional tissue require . TAK-228 administer orally 3 mg daily 21 day cycle . Clinical laboratory assessment make day 1 cycle . Disease assess compare unidimensional tumor measurement pre peritreatment imaging ( CT MRI ) week 6 , 12 , 18 every 12 week thereafter . Response assess accord RECIST 1.1 . Therapy continue disease progression unacceptable toxicity withdrawal consent .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>This trial two step inclusion criterion . Step 1 Inclusion Criteria 1 . Male female patient 18 year old . 2 . Patients must diagnosis locally advanced metastatic sarcoma progressing . The following subtypes ( consider genomically complex ) eligible : leiomyosarcoma ( well differentiate poorly differentiate ) , undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma , myxofibrosarcoma , pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma , pleomorphic liposarcoma , malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor , angiosarcoma extraskeletal osteosarcoma . Other potentially genomically complex Soft Tissue Sarcomas ( STS ) subtypes may include casebycase basis discussion principal investigator . 3 . Measurable disease RECIST 1.1 criterion ( least one target lesion outside previous radiation field progress within previous radiation field ) , describe detail section 15 . 4 . Progression disease radiographic imaging ( 10 % increase size RECIST v1.1 within 6 month registration ) presence new lesion . 5 . Must receive least 1 prior systemic therapy advance disease ( include adjuvant/neoadjuvant therapy curative setting ) . 6 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 02 . 7 . Adequate contraception follow : For woman : Postmenopausal least 1 year screen visit , OR Surgically sterile , OR If childbearing potential , agree practice 1 effective method contraception , 1 additional ( barrier ) method , time , time signing inform consent 90 day ( long , mandate local labeling [ eg . United Surgical Partners Internationals ( USPI ) , Summary Product Characteristics ( SmPC ) , etc ; ] ) last dose study drug OR agree practice true abstinence , line prefer usual lifestyle patient ( Periodic abstinence [ e.g , calendar , ovulation , symptothermal , postovulation method ] withdrawal , spermicide , lactational amenorrhea acceptable method contraception . Female male condom use together . ) Highly effective method : Intrauterine device ( IUD ) Hormonal ( birth control pills/oral contraceptive , injectable contraceptive , contraceptive patch , contraceptive implant ) Other effective Methods : Latex Condoms Diaphragm spermicide ; Cervical cap ; Sponge For men , even surgically sterilize ( ie , status postvasectomy ) , must : Agree practice highly effective barrier contraception entire study treatment period 120 day last dose study drug , OR agree practice true abstinence , line prefer usual lifestyle patient ( Periodic abstinence [ e.g , calendar , ovulation , symptothermal , postovulation method female partner ] withdrawal , spermicide , lactational amenorrhea acceptable method contraception . Female male condom use together . ) Agree donate sperm course study 120 day receive last dose study drug 8 . Screening clinical laboratory value specify : ) Bone marrow reserve consistent : i. absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.5 x 10 ( 9 ) /L ; ii . platelet count ≥ 100 x 10 ( 9 ) /L ; iii . hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL without transfusion within 1 week precede study drug administration b ) Hepatic : i. total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) , ii . transaminase ( Aspartate aminotransferase/Serum Glutamic Oxaloacetic Transaminase ( AST/SGOT ) Alanine aminotransferase/Serum Glutamic Pyruvic Transaminase ( ALT/SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 x ULN ( ≤ 5 x ULN liver metastasis present ) ; c ) Renal : creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min base either CockcroftGault estimate base urine collection ( 12 24 hour ) ; ) Metabolic : i. Glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) ≤ 7.0 % , ii . fast serum glucose ≤ 130 mg/dL iii . fast triglyceride ≤ 300 mg/dL 9 . Ability swallow oral medication . 10 . Voluntary write consent must give performance study relate procedure part standard medical care , understand consent may withdraw patient time without prejudice future medical care . 11 . Patients history brain metastasis eligible study provide follow criterion meet : 1 . Brain metastasis treat 2 . No evidence disease progression ≥ 3 month hemorrhage treatment 3 . Offtreatment dexamethasone 4 week administration first dose TAK228 4 . No ongoing requirement dexamethasone antiepileptic drug Step 2 Must meet meet step1inclusion exclusion criterion . 1 . Tumor must dysregulation PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway . For purpose study , patient must either PTEN protein genomic loss , phosphatidylinositol4,5bisphosphate 3kinase , catalytic subunit alpha ( PIK3CA ) / Phosphatase tensin homolog ( PTEN ) mutation . Patients must willing provide sufficient archival tissue . If available fresh tumor biopsy require . In event patient tumor analyze PTEN/PIK3CA status commercial mean , eligibility need additional tissue determine case case basis principle investigator . Step 1 Exclusion Criteria 1 . Any clinically significant comorbidities , uncontrolled pulmonary disease , active central nervous system disease , active infection , condition could compromise patient 's participation study . 2 .
