	<brief_summary>Cohort A - neoadjuvant administration IDH305 550 mg BID 6 week follow surgical resection 6 week . If evidence progressive disease 6 week ( clinical , radiographic histopathologic exam ) , patient continue IDH305 550 mg BID post-operatively maximum 11 additional 28 day cycle . Subsequent assessment disease occur every 2 month start Cycle 2 . Cohort B - patient inoperable tumor measurable 2HG pre-treatment treat IDH305 550 mg BID x 6 week . If adequate sustain knockdown 2HG MRS disease stable improve , patient continue treatment maximum 11 additional 28 day cycle .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 2 Study IDH305 Low Grade Gliomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>IDH1 mutation think among early mutation occur transformation glial cell gliomas dependence IDH-2HG pathway survival growth may relevant indolent phase low grade tumor growth . However , preclinical workup IDH inhibitor technically unable ass low grade glioma cell grow vitro culture , cell low proliferation rate grow mouse vivo model . Despite , Dr. Maher colleague study low grade metabolism low grade glioma vivo , patient undergo surgical resection infuse 13C-glucose 13C-acetate . 13C-labeled tumor study 13C-nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) ex vivo . 13C-NMR data IDH-mutated low grade glioma demonstrate tumor highly metabolically active , capable oxidize glucose acetate substrate also contribute carbon actively make 2HG ( manuscript preparation ) . These data strongly suggest low grade tumor may dependent IDH pathway maintain alter metabolic state cell alter epigenome necessary tumor growth . Treating low grade glioma period indolent growth pose challenge term evaluate molecular target therapy response survival . Standard MRI assessment low grade glioma base T2/FLAIR signal difficult quantitate reflect additional non-specific change tumor microenvironment include edema reactive gliosis . This exacerbated natural history tumor may change tumor size year . Added uncertainty drug able penetrate blood brain barrier , enter tumor inhibit target . To date , non-invasive way determine target inhibition , leave patient drug may inhibit target investigator unsure data obtain reflect true activity . The current clinical trial address challenge neoadjuvant clinical trial combine non-invasive evaluation 2HG MRS ass target inhibition within 1 week study entry direct tumor tissue analysis 6 week study surgical cohort . The comprehensive plan tissue analysis design assess impact IDH305 metabolic pathway , epigenome transcriptome , addition standard assessment cellular proliferation cell kill . A second cohort patient , non-surgical cohort , include patient presumptive diagnosis IDH-mutated glioma base elevate 2HG screen 2HG MRS without surgical resection plan perceive high risk procedure . It anticipate ~ 93 % patient IDH1 mutation thus treatment IDH1 selective inhibitor knockdown 2HG . For patient IDH2 mutation ( ~7-8 % ) , anticipate change 2HG . These patient come study , spar potential toxicity without potential benefit .</detailed_description>
