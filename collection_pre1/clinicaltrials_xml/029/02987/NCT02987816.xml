	<brief_summary>Recent change medical training environment restrictive work-hour regulation greatly impacted trainee , limit number opportunity gain proficiency procedural skill . Reports suggest medical resident lack confidence ability perform certain medical procedure , program director often believe resident operate independently major procedure . Simulator base task training ( SBTT ) provide safe ethically appropriate method skill acquisition training opportunity remain limited . Methods enhance motor learn train opportunity describe . Transcranial direct-current stimulation ( tDCS ) emerge form non-invasive brain stimulation show improve motor learning . tDCS show enhance increasingly complex skill acquisition . The investigator propose examine tDCS improve acquisition retention neurosurgical skill . The investigator propose double blind , sham-controlled randomize trial apply tDCS evidence-based SBTT medical student , determine brain stimulation enhance training skill acquisition retention . Even modest enhancement carry potential transform medicosurgical skill training .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Rationale : Recent change medical training environment result many trainee lack sufficient opportunity acquire specific skill necessary specialty . New method enhance acquisition retention medical surgical skill require ensure quality future physician workforce . Transcranial direct-current stimulation ( tDCS ) emerge method non-invasive brain stimulation show safely enhance motor learn adult child . Even modest enhancement acquisition retention medical-surgical skill tDCS carry potential accelerate skill train health care provider , thereby contribute great training efficiency improve patient outcomes . Objectives : The objective study ass whether tDCS enhance acquisition retention neurosurgical ability . Ethics : This study approval University Calgary Research Ethics Board Design : Randomized , double blind , sham-controlled trial evaluate ability tDCS enhance learn retention neurosurgical skill . Transcranial Direct-Current Stimulation : The tDCS method use base best-available evidence practice , apply standardized fashion experience investigator . Anodal tDCS deliver saline-soaked sponge electrode use NeuroConn Direct-Current Stimulator ( NeuroConn , Ilmenau , Germany ) . The anode center left primary motor cortex ( localize use 10-20 EEG System ) , cathode contralateral supraorbital area . Both anodal sham tDCS group current ramped-up 1milliamp 30 second . In anodal tDCS group , current hold 20 minute . In sham tDCS condition , current hold 60 second ( change cortical excitability ) follow 30 second ramp-down . Participants : Medical student ( year 1-3 ) Cumming School Medicine ( University Calgary ) recruit . To ensure comparable baseline skill , trainee exclude undergone formal neurosurgical training past 3 month . Sample size calculation base performance measure percentage virtual tumor resect , determine pilot study . Based 20 % tumor resect post-training , power 90 % type-1 error 0.05 , investigator estimate sample size minimum 24 participant ( n=12 per stimulation condition ) . Study Design : A short questionnaire complete determine demographic characteristic , include : gender , age , level training , many time participant perform virtual surgical simulator , often participants play video game , often participants play musical instrument . Participants recruit Project NeuroArm Laboratory ( University Calgary ) orient workspace . Participants complete virtual tumor resection NeuroTouch ( National Research Council Canada ) surgical simulator . Participants view standardized training video , create expert neurosurgery , demonstrate virtual tumor resection use simulator . Participant 3 minute resect virtual tumor , avoid resection healthy tissue . Recorded outcome metric include : % tumor resect , volume healthy tissue resect , time excessive force tumor time excessive force healthy tissue . Participants perform one resection baseline , establish baseline skill . Participants randomize receive sham active tDCS blind select code envelope , correspond particular stimulation condition . Participants perform eight training repetition , take approximately 30 minute . Following approximately 30 minute train ( eight train repetition ) tDCS electrode remove , final resection perform . Six week follow training participant return assess retention skill , perform single resection . Emerging evidence suggest significant decay surgical skill present six week follow training . Data Analysis : Independent sample t-test evaluate difference outcome metric post-training stimulation condition . Two-way repeated-measures ANOVA factor `` stimulation type '' `` training block '' explore interaction tDCS train outcome metric . Retention skill assess use pair t-test stimulation group .</detailed_description>
