	<brief_summary>This retrospective cohort study base Clinical Practice Research Datalink ( CPRD ) database analysis compare therapy effectiveness , cost exenatide basal insulin patient type 2 diabetes . Type 2 diabetes ( T2DM ) chronic condition characterize elevate blood sugar level ( hyperglycaemia ) result increase risk variety condition include heart disease , stroke , kidney failure , blindness amputation . Whilst initially patient may control blood sugar lifestyle modification ( diet exercise ) , ultimately require therapeutic intervention regimens increase complexity T2DM progress . Exenatide relatively recent anti-diabetic drug know lead weight loss well improve blood glucose control . It also associate reduced heart attack stroke . In study CPRD database use compare outcomes patient prescribed exenatide compare prescribed insulin ; establish treatment T2DM . In particular change baseline blood sugar control weight consider primary outcome . As choice treat exenatide insulin relate patient characteristic may associate outcome study aim match study patient key variable adjust others analysis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives study To compare change HbA1c weight baseline patient initiated exenatide based-therapy regimen initiate insulin-based therapy regimen among type 2 diabetes patient injectable naïve primary care UK . Health care utilization calculate treatment cohort , compare . Data source Patients select Clinical Practice Research Datalink ( CPRD ) , longitudinal , anonymized research database derive nearly 700 primary-care practice UK . These practice consider representative UK whole . The primary-care dataset ( CPRD GOLD ) comprise data demographic , diagnosis , hospital referral , prescription emanate primary care , aspects patient care . Approximately 60 % practice participate linkage scheme , patient record link data source , include Hospital Episode Statistics ( HES ) dataset provide data inpatient outpatient contact occur within National Health Service hospital England , Office National Statistics ( ONS ) mortality dataset . Diagnostic information CPRD primary-care dataset record use Read code classification UK primary-care practice standard . HES inpatient data record use International Classification Disease code , 10th revision ( ICD-10 ) ; ONS mortality data record use ICD-10 ICD-9 classification . Patient identification Method Patients define CPRD acceptable research quality classify type 2 diabetes Read code indicative diabetes least one follow selection criterion applies : 1. one diagnostic record exclusively type 2 diabetes , 2. prescription two different class non-insulin glucose-lowering therapy , 3. diagnostic code indicative type 2 diabetes ( regardless conflict diagnosis type 1 nonspecific diabetes ) plus prescription non-insulin glucose lower therapy . Two group case define patient receive exenatide monotherapy combination one oral glucose-lowering therapy base therapy code record within CPRD . The group : 1. exenatide weekly formulation ( Bydureon ) , 2. exenatide twice daily formulation ( Byetta ) . Patients exclude receive 1. prior injectable diabetes therapy 2. less 90 day continuous exposure exenatide therapy Control patient select pool type 2 diabetes patient prescription basal insulin monotherapy combination one oral glucose-lowering therapy . The exclusion criterion apply case apply , 1. prior injectable diabetes therapy 2. less 90 day continuous exposure basal insulin Matching perform direct matching propensity score match ratio 1:1 base follow criterion : 1. age ( ±5 year ) 2. gender , 3. year index exposure ( ±1 year ) , 4. diabetes duration ( ±2 year ) , 5 . BMI ( ±3 kg/ ) , 6 . HbA1c [ ±1 % ( ±11 mmol/mol ) 7 . Concurrent glucose-lowering medication . Index date initiation study drug January 2009 December 2014 . Primary care secondary contact ascertain CPRD GOLD HES databases respectively . Admissions describe number , length stay cost . Healthcare resource group ( HRGs ) assign patient spell process use HRG 4 grouper software ( National Casemix Office , Winchester , UK ) . The allocated HRG link 2014 National Tariff adjust nature admission ( elective admission versus emergency ) excess length stay . Primary care cost derive Units cost Health Social Care 2014 Baseline characteristic patient initiate either Bydureon/Byetta basal insulin present patient include direct match propensity score match analysis . Differences characteristic test use t-test continuous variable Pearson chi-square test categorical variable . Outcomes All patient receive standard care , intervention give study investigator . The primary outcome HbA1c weight change . Baseline measure define measurement -180 day baseline . Change measure baseline 6 month 12 - 24 month ( ± 90 day ) patient remain index regimen . HbA1c change baseline 6 month 12-24 month calculate difference treatment group compare . The proportion patient HbA1c fall 7.0 % also compare . Weight change baseline 6 month 12-24 month calculate difference treatment group compare . Differences consider absolute relative change baseline . Two composite end point consider base proportion patient : 1. reach target HbA1c &lt; =7.0 % % weight reduction 2. reach target HbA1c &lt; =7.0 % % weight reduction ≥5 % The proportion patient reach endpoint compare chi-square test . Analyses perform patient match directly match propensity score . Secondary outcome - Health service utilisation Rates cost health service contact calculate compare treatment group use Mann-Whitney U-test . Follow define time index date last prescription date + 90 day .</detailed_description>
