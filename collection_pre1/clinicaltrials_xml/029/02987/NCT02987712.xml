	<detailed_description>Background Recently change concept regard hemostatic profile patient liver disease `` auto-anti-coagulation '' `` rebalanced hemostasis '' . The liver synthesize factor inhibitor coagulation system well thrombopoietin . Thus , liver disease influence hemostatic profile effect factor/inhibitor level effect platelet number function . The `` rebalanced hemostasis '' liver disease result decrease level protein involve coagulation ; promotors inhibitor . Two protein elevate state factor VIII von Willebrand factor . Elevated level latter compensate extent thrombocytopenia platelet function defect . This `` rebalanced '' state well reflect conventional coagulation test ( CCT ) , insensitive anticoagulant component hemostasis . In fact , show thrombin generation cirrhotic patient normal . Considering conceptual change together well-known adverse effect blood product administration investigator seek re-evaluate clinical management cirrhotic patient undergo invasive procedure . Thromboelastography ( TEG ) provide graphic representation clot formation lysis . Compared CCTs , TEG good reflect interaction plasma , blood cell PLTs good resembles in-vivo state . Viscoelastic test use many year coagulation monitor hemostatic therapy guidance liver transplantation . Their use hospitalize patient liver disease much limited . Different guideline address issue coagulation test abnormality cirrhotic patient prior various specific invasive procedure . According European Association Study Liver clinical practice guideline , cirrhosis , hemorrhagic complication large volume paracentesis ( LVP ) infrequent data support pre-procedural use fresh frozen plasma ( FFP ) PLTs . The author note often product give case severe coagulopathy and/or thrombocytopenia , caution still exercise patient severe coagulopathy , LVP avoid presence disseminate intravascular coagulation . The American Association Study Liver Diseases practice guideline state bleeding uncommon , routine administration FFP PLTs prior paracentesis recommend . Very randomized , double-blind control clinical trial regard management coagulation issue patient liver disease exist . Some guideline note INR use alone assess bleed risk , PLT count great 50-60x10^9/L achieve prior high-risk procedure , TEG may helpful target transfusion practice . Pertaining esophageal varix , data support notion coagulopathy directly relate bleeding risk , despite existence various specific guideline management esophageal varix , specific recommendation coagulation parameter prophylactic esophageal variceal band ligation ( EVBL ) miss . When prophylactic EVBL deem unsafe due coagulation disorder , recommend avoid . Although uncertain optimal platelet count situation , recommend level exceed 56x10^9/L possibly fibrinogen level 100-150 mg/dL . They note FFP transfusion problematic large volume need `` correct '' INR . Consensus guideline peri-procedural management coagulation status hemostasis risk percutaneous image-guided intervention conclude central venous catheterization ( CVC ) perform safely experienced physician presence abnormal coagulation parameter . According editorial Chest , CVC insertion , even ultrasound guidance , carry significant risk mechanical complication , could life threaten . The editorial state reversal severe thrombocytopenia factor deficiency may decrease risk bleed patient severe coagulopathies , accord publish data , risk-to-benefit ratio favor reversal severe coagulopathies ( e.g. , PLTs 50x10^9/L and/or INR 1.5 , and/or PTT 50 ) . It note two aforementioned article refer coagulopathies whole specifically coagulopathy liver disease . Another study assess safety CVC insertion ultrasound guidance incidence complication patient liver disease coagulopathy . It conclude incidence major vascular non-vascular complication low even absence prophylactic correction coagulopathy incidence minor vascular complication higher acceptable easily manageable . A different study state coagulopathy cirrhotic patient undergo surgery major concern surgeon . Nonetheless , thrombocytopenia severe , automatically consider index increase bleed risk . They state compare CCTs , TEG provide well assessment degree coagulopathy offer information assist manage patient . Additionally , preoperative administration FFP correct INR avoid due ineffectiveness associated complication . There also general guideline cirrhotic patient undergo invasive procedure , among guideline regard hemostatic management patient population . These apply three clinical phase : 1 . Pre-procedural phase - prophylactic correction hemostasis apply , infection treat renal status optimize . 2 . Intra-procedural phase - active bleeding treat use transfusion antifibrinolytics , low central venous pressure ( CVP ) maintain normal body temperature , calcium pH maintain . 3 . Post-procedural phase - CVP restore normal thrombotic bleeding complication seek treat . The University Texas Southwestern Medical Center Dallas recently develop multidisciplinary guideline periprocedural transfusion blood component cirrhotic patient undergo gastrointestinal procedure . For procedure mild moderate-risk recommend transfuse PLTs count &gt; 30x10^9/L . As high-risk procedure , state PLTs may require procedure count &lt; 30x10^9/L . They recommend transfusion FFP INR isâ‰¥2.6 . Notably , randomize control trial perform De Pietry et al . evaluate TEG-guided blood product use invasive procedure cirrhosis severe coagulopathy . It conclude patient significant coagulopathy procedure , TEG guide infusion strategy lead significantly low use blood product compare CCT , without increase bleeding complication . Finally , several publication address coagulopathy management liver transplantation . These publication demonstrate method coagulation monitoring use effect transfusion practice viscoelastic test reduce overall transfusion requirement . Thus , seem ability CCTs predict bleed diathesis cirrhotic patient diminish , whereas TEG might accurate tool . It important bear mind adverse implication liberal use blood product . It seem current literature , although conflicting , lean towards restrictive approach prophylactic correction coagulopathy perform invasive procedure cirrhotic patient . Based literature clinical experience , investigator suspect common practice liberal practice prophylactic correction coagulation laboratory test abnormality common base publish guideline . Objectives - Assert whether use blood product prior invasive procedure cirrhotic coagulopathic patient reduce use TEG evaluate coagulopathy place CCTs . - Evaluate rate complication due blood product use patient . - Check correlation CCT result TEG patient . Methods Materials Study Design This prospective pre/post TEG protocol implementation study . It include two prospective survey 1:1 ratio . A full thorough medical history obtain . Medical condition , past surgery , medication currently use laboratory test result ( include TEG ) note . In addition , type procedure patient undergo record along bleed complication , blood product transfusion record , transfusion related side effect complication , complication attribute procedure avoidance , total hospital stay time procedure hospital release 90-day survival follow procedure . Subjects consecutively enrol , accordance selection criterion two survey : 1 . Survey 1 - perform baseline . Management base CCTs , per common practice . 2 . Survey 2 - management base TEG result . According new TEG protocol , subject reaction time ( r ) &gt; 12 min receive FFP , patient maximum amplitude ( MA ) &lt; 36 mm receive PLTs . All subject manage accord standard care . Regulatory Requirements This study protocol complies declaration Helsinki conduct accord rule guideline good clinical practice ( GCP ) . Informed Consent Informed consent obtain subject authorize research team member . Subject provide sufficient time reach rational , informed decision regard participation study . Subject Confidentiality Access data grant authorized study member . The Case Report Form ( CRF ) contain patient identification number . Any subject ' personal information remove CRF completion form integration database . Sample Size The study include total 120 subject , 60 group , order compensate dropout . Sample size calculate use WINPEPI program . Version 11.24 . Statistical Analysis investigator intend assess influence use TEG relate protocol use blood product cirrhotic patient . They examine relationship factor predict blood product use demographic data use blood product . Quantitative data normal distribution evaluate use t-test independent sample . In case assumption parametric test hold true , quantitative data evaluate use a-parametric Mann-Whitney test . Continuous data present averageÂ±SD . Dichotomous data evaluate use chi-square test . Fisher exact test use 20 % expect observation less 5 expect observation less 2 . Categorical data present number case percent . Multivariate logistic regression analysis use primary outcome exposure ( blood product use prevalence predict demographic factor ) order determine independent risk factor . The data include multivariate logistic regression model significant demographic data data find Pv &lt; 0.1 univariate analysis . A Pv 0.05 consider significant .</detailed_description>
