	<brief_summary>The immune system play important role help kill prevent cancer . Cells immune system , natural killer ( NK ) cell T cell , work well follow surgery . Arginine , amino acid , fundamental metabolic process body . Surgery show cause reduction arginine body . In turn , deficiency cause NK cell suppression . In study , want look effect arginine supplementation surgery NK cell function surgery patient . In study , use nutritional supplement contain arginine placebo drink ( provide Enhanced Medical Nutrition ) take colorectal cancer patient 5 day surgery 5 day surgery . Using patient blood sample , measure NK cell level , arginine level also arginase activity .</brief_summary>
