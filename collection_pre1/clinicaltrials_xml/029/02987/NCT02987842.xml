	<brief_summary>This study protocol propose EEG base neurofeedback ( EEG-NFB ) technique upregulate posterior cingulate cortex ( PCC ) patient suffer mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) early Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . EEG-NFB successfully use clinical tool 40 year . It base electrical activity measure near surface brain use EEG feed back patient within half second . MCI clinical condition consider precursor AD . NFB appear promising approach treat MCI , since show able induce change brain plasticity . This research focus PCC , report implicated MCI , due location ( proximity surface ) accessible mean EEG- NFB . A preliminary research MCI patient , conduct lab show low memory score begin training , good subject manage improve later . The investigator therefore presume patient early Alzheimer 's disease , whose cognitive ability affect compare MCI , may benefit EEG-NFB well , maybe large extent compare MCI .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cognitive impairment precede dementia call mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) . Patients MCI high risk progression Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) , rate 12 % per year . The amnestic form MCI common form , literature topic refers form disorder . Clinical criterion MCI include : 1 . Memory complaint , preferably corroborate informant . 2 . Objective memory impairment age education . 3 . Largely intact general cognitive function . 4 . Essentially preserved activity daily live . 5 . Not demented Currently , know cure MCI mean stop reverse progression . Patients Alzheimer 's disease also include study , consider many researcher continuum cognitive decline patient MCI indeed , carry increase risk develop Alzheimer 's disease . This study rely data preliminary study conduct investigator ' lab patient MCI , meant validate result . In aforementioned study , participant manage improve memory score 10 training session . In addition , negative correlation initial memory score ability improve found . It therefore hypothesize subject AD may benefit much subject MCI perhaps even large extent . Neurofeedback ( NFB ) treatment method base learn operant conditioning , feedback ( reward ) give proportion desire physiological activity order improve cognition and/or behavior . This research focus use electrical activity measure EEG physiological activity influence . EEG-NFB successfully use clinical tool 40 year treat various disorder epilepsy , attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) , stroke PTSD Electroencephalography ( EEG ) equipment use measure electrical activity represent neuronal activity different part brain . During treatment , electrode ( ) place predetermine location . Audio visual reward give activity measure within desired frequency range . Since NFB show able induce change brain plasticity , appear promising approach treat MCI . Few study show improvement cognition normal elderly subjective complains memory decline . To best knowledge , study first address memory decline MCI use EEG-based neurofeedback protocol , enhance individual upper alpha peak alpha frequency . This study include 30 participant randomly assign experimental sham group . The former include train individual upper alpha , latter include feedback static electrical activity disconnect electrode . participant train total 10 session period 5 week ( 2 training session per week ) , last approx . 1 hour . Cognitive evaluation take place baseline , train session end 30 day last session .</detailed_description>
