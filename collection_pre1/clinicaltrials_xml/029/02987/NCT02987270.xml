	<brief_title>Evaluation Community-based Mass Screening Treatment Malaria Western Kenya</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator purposively select ten health facility Siaya County , western Kenya base malaria case load . All village whose midpoint locate within 3 kilometer radius ten health facility include study . Contiguous village merge form two cluster around health facility . Clusters randomly assign control intervention arm one control one intervention cluster around health facility . Approximately 30,000 60,000 people reside intervention control arm , respectively . Once year peak malaria transmission season July , start baseline , investigator select simple random sample compound within study area cross-sectional survey determine risk factor malaria acquisition parasite prevalence . Every person select compound consent cross-sectional survey . Community health volunteer ( CHV ) train perform malaria rapid diagnostic test , collect dry blood spot filter paper , provide treatment referral recommendation participant . Three time year , September , January , April , two year , CHVs visit every household intervention arm test treated every consenting household member positive malaria rapid diagnostic test . Throughout study period , malaria case count individual locate within study cluster record study health facility . During first two cross-sectional survey randomly select 660 individual enter incidence cohort , 330 per arm . Cohort member definitively treat malaria recruitment artemether-lumefantrine , ask visit study health facility month blood draw malaria test . Every month , 18 household randomly select entomological monitoring ; 12 control arm , 6 intervention arm . Pyrethrum spray catch perform household . Live catch perform one week month study . During live collection week , many household visit possible , prokopak aspirator use collect mosquito inner wall house . Prior first round mass screen treatment first round , 36 focus group discussion conduct evaluate community acceptance community-based mass screening treatment .</detailed_description>
