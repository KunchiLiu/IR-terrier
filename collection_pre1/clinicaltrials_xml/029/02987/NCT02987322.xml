	<brief_summary>Background : Honey , natural product produce honey bee , anti-oxidant , anti-microbial , anti-inflammatory immunomodulator property . A report suggest honey might positive effect cardiovascular disease . Methods : This randomize control study , carry 50 child , age 2 12 year , suffer idiopathic dilate cardiomyopathy ( IDC ) . Patients randomly assign two equal group : honey group control group . In honey group , honey provide dose 1.2g/kg/day three month addition traditional treatment IDC . The patient control group receive standard treatment , without honey . The main outcome measure percent change ejection fraction ( EF ) fraction shorten ( FS ) show echocardiography .</brief_summary>
