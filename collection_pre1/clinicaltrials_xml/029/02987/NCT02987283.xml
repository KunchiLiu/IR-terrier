	<brief_title>Evaluating Accuracy Breath Sound Recordings STOP-Bang Screening For Obstructive Sleep Apnea While Awake</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) breathe disorder numerous health effect include great risk peri-operative anesthetic complication . Numerous screening tool exist without limitation . Diagnostic overnight sleep study resource-intensive difficult obtain short time period pre-operative clinic assessment day surgery . This project aim test diagnostic performance new screen technology , Awake-OSA , screen obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) . `` Awake-OSA '' use small external microphone place neck , record analyze tracheal breath sound bedside patient awake . Using polysomnography ( PSG ) gold standard , investigator compare Awake-OSA ( breath sound record ) STOP-Bang screen questionnaire ability accurately identify patient OSA , well classify OSA term severity . Early , point-of-care diagnosis potential provide low-cost , convenient alternative traditional screening questionnaire enable selective use PSG . Our goal improve peri-operative patient safety improve use resource streamline patient care .</detailed_description>
