	<brief_summary>Dapagliflozin unique mechanism action directly affect either insulin resistance insulin secretion , rather improve glycemia reduction glucose re-absorption proximal renal tubule . Dapagliflozin expect reduce mean daily glucose , improve glycemic control reduce overall insulin requirement . Improved glycemic control reduce variability may also lead reduced frequency hypoglycemia . In youth T1D , Dapagliflozin lead significant reduction insulin need achieve target glucose irrespective preexisting HbA1c level . In pilot study data collect investigate effect glucose two dos 10mg ( ) dapagliflozin within range ensue 24 hour DreaMed automate insulin delivery patient type 1 diabetes dose dapagliflozin in-patient setting combine automate sensor base CE mark insulin delivery system data dapagliflozin suitable add-on therapy . This provide optimal monitoring subject safety assessment effect dapagliflozin structure setting . If inpatient study show evidence Dapagliflozin suitable add therapy lead increase time within target glucose range use sensor base insulin pump therapy ( closed-loop ) outpatient study plan conduct .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Explore Efficacy DAPAglifozin add-on Closed-loop Control Patients With Type 1 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose pilot study collect clinical data two dos 10mg ( ) dapagliflozin add-on night day closed-loop control use DreaMed automate insulin delivery time [ % ] within glucose range 70-180 mg/dl ( 3.9-10mmol/l ) ensue 24 hour two oral mixed-meals . The study aim patient different degree inadequate glycemic control despite insulin use . A maximum 45 patient screen 30 Type 1 Diabetes mellitus patient ( 15 adult , 15 adolescent ) complete study . The trial consist six visit : screen visit ( Visit 1 ) , two dose visit ( Visit 2 Visit 4 ) , two phone visit ( Visit 3 Visit 5 ) follow-up visit ( Visit 6 ) . Furthermore , information visit take place prior screen visit order obtain patient 's informed consent . Screening take place 2-21 day prior Visit 2 follow-up visit take place 5-21 day end Visit 4 . The dose visit separate wash-out period ( 5-30 day end Visit 2 begin Visit 4 ) subject resume normal insulin treatment . Each phone visit ( Visit 3 Visit 5 ) take place 3-5 day end dose Visits 2 4 . The planned total duration trial 18-78 day per subject ( rescheduled visit exclude ) . Each subject randomise treatment sequence consist two treatment period subject receive 2 time 10mg dapagliflozin placebo two separate dose visit . Subjects metabolic control achieve use DreaMed system ( closed loop ) . The procedure use order aim maintain blood glucose level 70 180 mg/dl thereby . Two standardized mixed-meals give 12 hour 18 hour dose . Blood glucose measurement perform every 30min 120min mixed-meal . Blood sample determination dapagliflozin concentration serum take 14times 24hours well ß-Hydroxybutyrate every urine sample collect 24 hour first dose determination 24hour urinary glucose creatinine efficacy measurement . In addition full blood gas analysis drawn elevate β-hydroxybutyrate &gt; 1.0 mmol/L detect . 24 hour first dose dapagliflozin/ placebo dose visit subject resume usual insulin treatment leave hospital . After conclusion trial document insulin dos time sum calculation total insulin dose insulin dose per kg body weight per 24 hour .</detailed_description>
