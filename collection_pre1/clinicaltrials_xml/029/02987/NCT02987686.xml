	<brief_summary>Corneal melt complication could affect ill eye lead thin cornea ( clear window cover eye ) . This thin lead severe consequence leakage liquid inside eye ( ocular perforation ) , even blindness . Corneal melt cause certain infection sterile process . This project include patient sterile corneal melt ( without infection ) cause disease rosacea , Sjogren 's syndrome , rheumatoid arthritis , Crohn 's disease , Stevens Johnson syndrome , well toxic epidermal necrolysis mucous membrane pemphigoid . Infliximab antibody tumour necrosis factor alpha use treat prevent corneal melt certain patient inflammatory auto-immune disease . In situation , infliximab use intravenous ( use vein ) order treat whole body . This study 's hypothesis infliximab safely use eye drop treatment sterile corneal melt .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Topical Infliximab Sterile Corneal Melt</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This unmasked , prospective , single-center trial twelve patient sterile corneal melt underlie auto-immune inflammatory disease , rosacea , Sjogren 's syndrome , rheumatoid arthritis , Crohn 's disease , Stevens Johnson syndrome , well toxic epidermal necrolysis mucous membrane pemphigoid . The aim phase I study evaluate safety tolerability topical infliximab 10mg/ml eye drop treatment corneal melt . As , six ( 6 ) subject recruit experimental treatment study six ( 6 ) subject enrol parallel observational study . Indeed , candidate inclusion criterion one exclusion criterion ( contraindication infliximab use ) , recruit observational study , receive standard treatment without infliximab . During treatment period , subject therapeutic study receive topical infliximab 10mg/ml four ( 4 ) time per day four ( 4 ) week . In order determine safety profile , potential side effect well course disease , subject monitor study medication well 8 week follow discontinuation drug . The ophthalmological follow-up identical two group . However , subject enrol experimental treatment study receive additional laboratory test . The total study duration patient 12 week . In term statistical analysis , investigator focus describe outcome measure study . For instance , investigator describe number proportion side effect , number patient quiescent corneal melt 4 week patient require tectonic surgery 12 week post-treatment . The investigator report average standard deviation OSDI score , epithelial deficit surface well minimal corneal thickness . Moreover , investigator perform exploratory statistical analysis order study disease course subject compare addition infliximab standard .</detailed_description>
