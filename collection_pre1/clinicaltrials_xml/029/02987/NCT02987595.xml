	<brief_summary>Diet play important role relation prevention type 2 diabetes , cardiovascular disease certain cancer . Studies show diet high whole-grain content could decrease risk lifestyle relate disease Sweden national dietary guideline recommend whole-grain base instead refine cereal product . It , however , clear whether whole-grain wheat rye share similar protective effect since large difference amount quality dietary fibre associate bioactive compound . The aim study evaluate impact wholegrain diet low- high lignan content different cardiometabolic risk factor primary endpoint blood glucose level 2h oral glucose tolerance test men metabolic syndrome sign thereof .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Lignan-rich Diet Cardiometabolic Risk Factors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study conduct randomize , cross-over design ( 8 wk intervention period ) . The lignan-rich diet base whole-grain rye product whereas control diet base whole-grain wheat product add wheat bran . Both diet provide similar amount whole grain ( g/d ) total dietary fiber content ( dietary fibre quality different ) . Although rye high lignan content , aim increase lignan intake half-way whole grain rye intervention period . This allow u distinguish effect lignans effect whole grain rye well evaluate potential difference effect cardiometabolic risk factor whole grain wheat whole grain rye intake 4-week consumption . The study design also allow u investigate effect putative interaction microbiome x lignan rich diet implication metabolic risk factor . Blood sample collect trained nurse screen , baseline , 4 week 8 week first intervention period , wash-out ( 8 week ) , 4 week 8 week second intervention period . At examination day participant arrive test laboratory blood sample oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) participant give drink 75 g glucose consume within 10 minute . Blood sample take 30 , 60 120 minute . Furthermore , participant instruct complete one 3-day weight food record also collect 24-h urine fecal sample week 0 , 4 , 8 , 16 , 20 24 .</detailed_description>
