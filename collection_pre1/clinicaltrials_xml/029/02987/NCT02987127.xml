	<brief_summary>Gastric low-grade mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma ( MALToma ) associate Helicobacter pylorus ( HP ) infection , around 70 % tumor cure HP eradication therapy ( HPE ) . However , role antibiotic frontline treatment extragastric MALToma remain unclear . In addition anecdotal case report show histologic regression extragastric MALTomas antibiotic , explorative study find frontline HPE ( clarithromycin , amoxicillin , omeprazole ) result complete remission ( CR ) subgroup patient ( 2 salivary gland , 1 lung , 1 colon , 4 ocular adnexal MALToma [ OAML ] ) . Interestingly , two patient OAML respond Chlamydia psittaci ( CP ) eradication use doxycycline achieve CR HPE . These finding suggest bacterial infection , include HP , may involve lymphomagenesis extragastric MALTomas . Our preliminary result also reveal 5 ( 23.8 % ) 21 HP-negative gastric MALToma patient achieve CR HPE , indicate antibiotic may also ability eradicate non-HP bacteria . Based preliminary finding indolent biologic behavior MALToma , reasonable use frontline HPE treatment early-stage low-grade extragastric MALToma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Study Frontline H Pylori Eradication Treatment Early-stage Extragastric MALT Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Through prospective trial frontline HPE treatment early-stage extragastric MALToma , investigator evaluate investigate follow issue : 1 . The CR partial remission ( PR ) rate antibiotic 1st-line therapy stage IE stage IIE extragastric MALToma 2 . The durability CR PR ( relapse-free survival ) antibiotic treatment ( HPE ) early-stage extragastric MALToma 3 . The assessment evidence bacterial infection , HP , extragastric MALToma . 4 . The identification potential biomarkers help u predict whether extragastric MALToma respond frontline HPE .</detailed_description>
