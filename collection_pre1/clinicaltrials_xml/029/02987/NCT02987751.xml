	<brief_summary>This study multicentre , randomize , open label comparison Long-Acting Basal Insulin Analog Glargine plus Glulisine Premixed Insulin Adult Patients Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus 200 patient conduct seven center Tamil Nadu . The primary outcome measure compare change HbA1c baseline week 24 Glargine OD + Glulisine comparison Premixed insulin initiation insulin naïve patient T2DM . The secondary outcome compare follow two arm baseline 24 week Fasting plasma glucose , Postprandial glucose , 7-point self-monitored blood glucose ( SMBG ) profile , Percentage participant HbA1c &lt; 7 % , Insulin dose , Overall adverse event , Symptomatic Hypoglycemia , Severe hypoglycemic , Weight , BMI Blood pressure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Comparison Glargine Plus Glulisine With Premixed Insulin Type 2 Diabetes Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The subject invite study centre local population willing participate trial . Each subject inform orally write study prior inclusion study subject give write informed consent include . The selection subject base inclusion exclusion criterion define protocol . The selected subject give screen number subject screening procedure find eligible candidate enrollment . The screening procedure include obtain subject 's anthropometric data , baseline symptomatology , medical history , vital sign , physical examination , laboratory investigation like blood glucose ( fast &amp; 2hr meal ) , HbA1c , Urea , Creatinine , Liver function test , Lipid profile , Urine albumin/creatinine ratio , urine pregnancy ( applicable ) ECG . This follow 2 week run period eligible patient ensure patient stable dose oral therapy Metformin &lt; 1500 mg/day . Sulfonylurea stop . All eligible patient per inclusion criterion ( HbA1c ≥7.5 % ≤ 10.5 % , fast blood glucose ≥ 150 mg/dl , and/or Postprandial blood glucose ≥ 200 mg/dl ) randomize two arm . Participants arm-1 receive daily insulin Glargine ( 12 unit ) plus daily Glulisine ( 4 unit ) breakfast/dinner , along OHAs stable dose titrate optimally . Participants arm-2 receive daily premix analogue insulin ( 30/70 ) 16 unit breakfast/dinner , along OHAs stable dose titrate per treatment algorithm . During randomization visit , select subject run period give subject number randomize two arm . Anthropometric measurement vital sign take . Concomitant medication adverse event note . Glucose meter , strip , Insulin study diary dispense . Training Glucose meter usage , hypoglycemia , hyperglycemia symptom , Insulin injection technique dose titration technique do . Subjects instruct maintain record dosing detail patient diary . They give Diet Exercise counsel . They ask hand study diary Insulin pen ( empty full ) coordinator visit . First three month insulin dose titration period subject ask visit clinic 12 week . Telephonic visit week 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 11 . At week 4 , 8 investigator unscheduled visit training insulin dispense . During telephonic visit subject ask concomitant medication adverse event . During clinic visit 12 week unscheduled visit week 4 8 anthropometric measurement , vital sign , concomitant medication adverse event record . Glucometer strip , Insulin study diary dispense . The Insulin study diary give previous visit collect . The dose Insulin titrate accord algorithm give appendix 7 point SMBG do subject ±5 day follow week 4 , 8 &amp; 12 also insulin dose titrate finger prick FBS PPBS do week 2 , 6 10 . After 3 month , participant arm-1 may undergo intensification 2 injection Glulisine HbA1c &gt; 7 % and/or 2-h postprandial glucose &gt; 140 mg/dL . After 3 month , participant arm-2 premix OD make BD HbA1c &gt; 7 % and/or 2-h postprandial glucose &gt; 140 mg/dL despite effective titration exist dos . The next three month insulin dose maintenance period subject ask visit clinic 24 week . At week 16 20 telephonic visit unscheduled visit perform . During telephonic visit ask concomitant medication adverse event . During clinic visit 24 week unscheduled visit week 16 20 , anthropometric measurement , vital sign , concomitant medication adverse event record . Glucometer strip , Insulin study diary dispense . The Insulin study diary give previous visit collect . The dose Insulin , need titrate accord algorithm give appendix 7 point SMBG do subject ±5 day follow week 16 , week 20 week 24 . During clinic visit week 12 24 , Medical history , Physical examination , laboratory investigation like blood glucose ( fast &amp; 2hr meal ) , HbA1c , Urea , Creatinine , Liver function test , Lipid profile , Urine albumin/creatinine ratio , urine pregnancy ( applicable ) ECG week 24 do . During end study visit week 24 subject undergo medical examination , anthropometric measurement , vital sign , concomitant medication adverse event record . The Insulin study diary give previous visit collect . Subjects experience hypoglycemia inform coordinator investigator phone make unscheduled visit . In case experience adverse event inform coordinator investigator phone make unscheduled visit per investigator 's discretion .</detailed_description>
