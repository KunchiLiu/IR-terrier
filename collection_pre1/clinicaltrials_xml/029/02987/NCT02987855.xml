They appear dysregulation central nervous system ( CNS ) autonomic system ( sympathetic/parasympathetic ) cause extensive functional loss , impairment , disability . They often associate injury site ( include surgical ) produce constant , often disable pain motor-sensory loss . Treatments often ineffective include medication ( often high dose opiate ) , Physical Therapy ( PT ) , surgical intervention ( sympathectomy , ablation ) insertion stimulators CNS .

	<detailed_description>Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy ( RSD ) , Complex Regional Pain Syndrome ( CRPS ) , Causalgia , Fibromyalgia represent progressive systemic pain condition often worsen time . They appear dysregulation central nervous system ( CNS ) autonomic system ( sympathetic/parasympathetic ) cause extensive functional loss , impairment , disability . They often associate injury site ( include surgical ) produce constant , often disable pain motor-sensory loss . Treatments often ineffective include medication ( often high dose opiate ) , physical therapy ( PT ( , surgical intervention ( sympathectomy , ablation ) insertion stimulators CNS . Clinical Features include neurogenic inflammation , nociceptive sensitization , vasomotor dysfunction maladaptive neuroplasticity . As often seem relate specific injury site ( trauma , surgical , etc . ) follow severe pain sensation stabbing , burning , throb , local muscular spasm hemiparesis . In addition , many report visual change , drop attack ( sudden fall ) , joint soreness , systemic symptom associate potentially organ body . Diagnosis typically recognize 3 distinct `` type '' appear sequential nature . Type 1 characterization severe , burn sensory change near injury site , musculoskeletal joint stiffness . Type 2 demonstrates high pain level , swell , muscular atrophy , joint degeneration , depression , concomitant dysfunction . Type 3 feature irreversible change skin/bone , extreme loss function muscle ( atrophic primarily ) tendon . A significant percentage ( 13-70 ) felt risk neurological injury , hemiplegia , enhance vasomotor issue due enhance sympathetic action neurotransmission issue . This study include microcannula harvest subdermal adipose tissue , incubation , digestion isolation AD-cSVF . This stromal cellular pellet ( without actual extracellular matrix stromal element ) suspend 500 cc sterile Normal Saline ( NS ) deploy via peripheral intravenous route . Evaluations safety issue measure interval ( severe non-severe category ) repeat pulmonary function study .</detailed_description>
