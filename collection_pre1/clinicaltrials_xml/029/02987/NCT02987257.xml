	<brief_summary>Defining true effect adjunctive therapy Stevens-Johnson Syndrome Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis ( SJS/TEN ) time full healing , mortality , long-term outcome represent critical need field dermatology burn surgery . Collaborating 20 site across North America determine cyclosporine etanercept therapy improves SJS/TEN short outcome supportive care alone The scientific premise study case series , cohort , small non-randomized study support use non-pulsed corticosteroid intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIG ) , show promise cyclosporine etanercept reduce time complete re-epithelialization . By indirect comparison , etanercept appear superior small study , however none study evaluate therapy blind randomized trial . Additionally , uncover underlying process SJS/TEN analysis skin sample , blood , blister fluid immune cell study immune system change gene expression without drug therapy . This improve treatment patient future .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aim 1 : Establish effective therapy SJS/TEN . A multi-centered , double-blind randomize control trial include 20 site enrollment 267 patient 4 year undertaken understand supportive care , cyclosporine etanercept cause great reduction time complete re-epithelialization . Assessment primary outcome occur use previously validate method consist two independent assessor digital photograph analysis . Secondary outcome include all-cause mortality , time cessation disease progression , adverse effect relate study medication , secondary chronic mucocutaneous morbidity , hospital length stay . Subgroup analysis perform examine difference treatment gender , SCORTEN , percent body surface area ( % BSA ) drug half-life . Aim 2 : Enhance understanding genetic biomarker predictor SJS/TEN . Genome sequence transcriptome profiling use evaluate change expression time within treatment arm identify involve gene response treatment . Changes course hospitalization follow-up visit test . Additionally , high resolution HLA Mega chip type performed individual clear drug cause accord Algorithm Drug Causality Epidermal Necrolysis ( ALDEN ) Score . These match drug tolerant control . Third , measurement granulysin occur presentation serial time point establish role predictive biomarker disease prognosis response treatment . Aim 3 : To gain insight immunopathogenesis SJS/TEN . We collect blister fluid , skin biopsy peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) acute SJS/TEN reaction treatment , follow completion treatment ( PBMCs ) , follow-up recovery PBMCs . This analyze T-cell change gene expression relate disease treatment . We expect direct therapy future .</detailed_description>

Confirmation interface dermatitis +/ necrotic keratinocytes +/ eosinophils 2 . Negative direct immunofluorescence feature alter diagnosis Patient meeting 1 follow criterion exclude participating : 1 . A serious drug reaction alternate dermatologic diagnosis time initial evaluation keep SJS/TEN . 2 . Patients receive 2 concomitant study medication specifically treat SJS/TEN would remove avoid confound outcome measure response specific therapy . 3 .
