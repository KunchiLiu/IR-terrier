	<brief_summary>In people diagnosed chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) anaemia common problem often treat EPO ( Erythropoietin ) . One form EPO use Darbepoetin ( Aranesp® ) . EPO safe use associate rise blood pressure ( BP ) individual . The reason clear . To try explain , study look EPO affect certain substance blood influence blood vessel contract relax . This conduct infuse small amount Acetylcholine , BQ123 Noradrenaline arm vessel volunteer use establish method call Forearm blood flow ( plethysmography ) . Volunteers recruit study include CKD patient undergo therapy Darbepoetin part normal NHS care well healthy people treatment , act control . This observational pilot study change physiology Darbepoetin . It provide valuable data later study compare Darbepoetin novel agent work via different pathway treat anaemia .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This pilot proposal understand change physiology patient undergo schedule therapy Darbepoetin part normal NHS care . It therefore observational pilot study change physiology Darbepoetin . Conventional erythropoiesis stimulate agent ( ESAs ) widely use improve haemoglobin production reduce anaemia subject chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) . However , ESAs associate development hypertension increase cardiovascular morbidity mortality . A number potential underlying pathophysiological mechanism postulate , mostly concern around alter sensitivity , circulating level , endogenous vasoactive mediator . However , exist data inconsistent . Hand et al . find short-term therapy recombinant erythropoietin associate rise blood pressure , increase vasoconstrictor responsiveness infuse noradrenaline , endothelin-1 . Serum endothelin-1 level elevate compare control baseline , change erythropoietin therapy . Other group report ESA administration increase plasma level endothelin-1 , strongly correlated increase mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) . Human endothelial cell incubate ESAs show decreased eNOS expression endothelial nitric oxide ( NO ) production . Ex-vivo study resistance vessel subject CKD find impaired endothelial function , assess acetylcholine mediate vasodilatation , partially reverse blockade endothelin receptor ( ET-A ) . In vivo acute chronic ESA administration also impair endothelial function , often consider surrogate nitric oxide bioavailability . Recently , new agent postulate novel alternative ESAs treat renal anaemia . However , cardiovascular effect incompletely characterise . Studies elucidate mechanisms ESA induce vasoconstriction possible effect promote cardiovascular disease necessary would imperative study whether use novel agent avoids effect , potentially make well alternative ESAs . This pilot study aim determine putative mechanism may involve BP response ESA use patient anaemia associate CKD EPO naïve within last 12 month . Information gain study inform large clinical trial plan . Healthy volunteer recruit provide baseline normal response compare .</detailed_description>
