	<brief_summary>This multi-center , first-in-human , open-label , Phase 1/2A dose-escalation study eligible patient metastatic castration-resistant prostate carcinoma ( mCRPC ) receive oral dos TRC253 .

	<brief_title>A Phase 1/2A Study TRC253 , Androgen Receptor Antagonist , Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The patient population consist men ≥18 year age adenocarcinoma prostate metastatic disease . Patients undergone orchiectomy must serum testosterone level &lt; 50 ng/dL determine within 4 week prior start study drug , , applicable , must discontinue treatment first second generation anti-androgens specify inclusion criterion . During Part 1 study , patient assign sequentially increase TRC253 dos . The start dose TRC253 40 mg daily , orally . TRC253 dose escalate subsequent cohort patient enrol give cohort complete 28-day dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) evaluation period . Dose escalation Part 1 follow single-patient dose escalation design drug-related toxicity occurs . When initial drug-related toxicity occur DLT single patient cohort expand accord 3+3 design rule . Subsequent dose level enroll patient base 3+3 design . At maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) minimum efficacious dose ( MED ) , twelve patient may enrol . Part 2 consist two cohort initially 30 patient ( Cohort 1 ) 30 patient ( Cohort 2 ) receive TRC253 recommend Phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) . The objective Part 2 gather additional information safety , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) pharmacodynamic ( PD ) characteristic , clinical efficacy TRC253 pre-defined population patient metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer ( mCRPC ) . Patients enrol Part 2 receive prior treatment enzalutamide apalutamide show characteristic acquire resistance base change PSA serum level . Patients centrally screen presence AR F876L ( androgen receptor F876L ) mutation plasma sample enrol Cohort 1 ( AR F876L positive ) Cohort 2 ( AR F876L negative ) . Cohort 2 may expand specific molecular mechanism sensitize mCRPC TRC253 therapy identify retrospectively . Additional patient may prospectively select specific molecular resistance mechanism add Cohort 2 upon recommendation medical monitor Principal Investigators .</detailed_description>

Ongoing androgen depletion therapy gonadotropinreleasing hormone ( GnRH ) analog inhibitor , orchiectomy ( i.e. , surgical medical castration ) . Note : patient undergone orchiectomy must continue GnRH analog therapy duration protocol . 10 . For patient previously treat first generation antiandrogens ( i.e. , flutamide , nilutamide , bicalutamide ) , discontinuation flutamide nilutamide therapy must occur &gt; 4 week ( &gt; 6 week bicalutamide ) prior start study drug evidence antiandrogen withdrawal response ( i.e. , decline serum PSA ) . 11 . For patient previously treat chemotherapy , target therapy , immunotherapy , treatment investigational anticancer agent , discontinuation must occur ≥2 week , least 4 halflives , whichever longer , prior study drug administration . For enzalutamide apalutamide , washout period least 3 week prior start study drug evidence antiandrogen withdrawal response ( i.e. , decline serum PSA ) . 12 . For patient previously treat agent approve treatment prostate cancer ( 5α reductase inhibitor , estrogen , others ) , discontinuation therapy must occur ≥4 week prior start study drug . 13 . Palliative radiotherapy ( bone soft tissue lesion ) must complete &gt; 2 week prior start study drug . 14 . For patient receive boneloss prevention treatment ( e.g. , bisphosphonates denosumab ) , patient must stable dose ≥4 week prior start study drug . 15 .
