	<detailed_description>Percutaneous nephrolithotomy renal lithiasis endoscopic treatment . It usually two stag : begin lithotomy position ureteral catheter placement retrograde pyelography , subsequently , optimal renal access obtain prone position . The PNL usually two stag . It begin lithotomy position cystoscopic placement ureteral catheter retrograde pyelography , subsequently , patient place mainly prone position percutaneous access stone removal . This position offer option puncture . In center , PNL do GA , associate risk complication due put intubated , muscle-relaxed , unconscious patient prone position . Other complication , include blood transfusion , nausea vomit fever , often observed general regional anesthesia ; cost general anesthesia also higher . The regional anesthesia perform independently PNL include spinal , epidural combine spinal-epidural block . A segmental epidural block well spinal anesthesia term hemodynamic stability , postoperative analgesia , patient 's satisfaction reduce incidence postoperative nausea vomit . For epidural anesthesia take long act spinal one allow avoid motor block patient change position lithotomy prone little assistance . The position patient change rapidly right spinal anesthesia perform , due risk high anesthesia level hemodynamic complication . The aim study evaluate epidural anesthesia perform PNL last decade Medical University Warsaw Urology Department .</detailed_description>
