	<detailed_description>This randomized phase 2 study oncolytic polio/rhinovirus recombinant ( PVSRIPO ) alone combination chemotherapy drug lomustine adult patient recurrent World Health Organization ( WHO ) grade IV malignant glioma Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Center ( PRTBTC ) Duke . The primary objective study ass survival subject receive PVSRIPO without single dose lomustine relative survival observe historical control group . The secondary objective ass safety PVSRIPO combination lomustine . Subjects randomize receive either PVSRIPO alone , PVSRIPO combination single dose lomustine 8 week PVSRIPO infusion , evaluate impact treatment regimens 24-month survival . PVSRIPO deliver intratumorally convection-enhanced delivery ( CED ) use intracerebral catheter place within enhance portion tumor . Subjects randomize lomustine arm receive single oral dose 110 mg/m2 lomustine 8 week PVSRIPO administration . The target accrual study 62 patient , 31 patient per arm . All patient randomize receive PVSRIPO treatment include efficacy safety analyses..</detailed_description>
