	<brief_summary>Carpal tunnel syndrome ( CTS ) common peripheral entrapment neuropathy involve compression median nerve carpal tunnel . Rather progressive disease , CTS characterize remission recurrence . Although many conservative management CTS , effectiveness method insignificant persist short duration . The platelet rich plasma ( PRP ) new potential treatment patient kinds musculoskeletal disorder recent report show beneficial peripheral neuropathy animal study . Since 2014 , three small clinical trial show positive effect PRP peripheral neuropathy include CTSin pilot research . However , study entirely prove effect PRP peripheral neuropathy study enrol small number patient lack controlled design . The investigator design randomize , double-blind , control trail ass effect ultrasound-guided PRP injection patient CTS .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>After obtain write informed consent , patient bilateral CTS randomize intervention control side . Participants intervention group receive one-dose ultrasound-guided PRP injection control side receive one-dose ultrasound-guided normal saline injection . No additional treatment injection study period . The primary outcome visual analog scale ( VAS ) secondary outcome include Boston Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Questionnaire ( BCTQ ) , cross-sectional area ( CSA ) median nerve , sensory nerve conduction velocity median nerve , finger pinch strength . The evaluation perform pretreatment well 2nd week , 1st , 3rd , 6th month one year treatment .</detailed_description>
