	<brief_title>Comparison Intra-articular Intra-tendinous Injections Treatment Lateral Epicondylitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Lateral epicondylitis , commonly know `` tennis elbow '' common cause elbow pain , occur 1-3 % adults year . It common pathology encounter primary care , well specialty clinic . The typical patient 4th-5th decade . Males female affect equally dominant arm commonly involved . Patients participate sport work related activity involve repetitive forearm rotation elbow extend high risk develop symptom . Symptom onset insidious related repetitive microtrauma , similar chronic overuse tendinopathies . Patients classically present tenderness lateral aspect elbow , distal anterior lateral epicondyle , origins extensor carpus radialis brevis ( ECRB ) extensor digitorum communis ( EDC ) muscle . Pain worsen resisted wrist finger extension . 1,2 Much information investigator regard lateral epicondylitis work Nirschl colleague . The etiology lateral epicondylitis believe result small tear ECRB origin repetitive microtrauma . Gross examination reveals grayish , immature scar tissue appear shiny , edematous friable . Histologic analysis reveals term `` angiofibroblastic hyperplasia '' ECRB tendon origin . There inflammatory cell note histology , put question classification lateral epicondylitis inflammatory condition.3-6 Baker et al note consistent capsular change see arthroscopy develop classification system , hint another source pain may inside joint.7,8 Early author describe mass grayish tissue ECRB origin , intimate joint capsule . It may tissue cause capsular inflammation , lead elbow pain.9 Although lateral epicondylitis common , little consensus exist best way treat . Historic teach 80 % patient get good non-operative treatment , range relative rest , NSAIDs , brace injection . There approximately 4-11 % patient , however , require operative treatment symptom resolution.1 Current mainstay treatment non-operative . Many patient get good rest activity avoidance . Counterforce brace lead quicker recovery , however , allow forceful activity recovery period.10 NSAIDs show add benefit long term either.1,2 There significant interest efficacy injection treatment acute chronic lateral epicondylitis . Steroid injection use standard treatment decade . Anecdotally , patient well injection . Recent large , prospective , randomized study show minor improvement short term , long term benefit compare saline injection.11-15 Protocols study vary greatly , steroid utilized injection technique . Common injection technique include inject point maximal tenderness versus ECRB origin . Additionally , author inject single time , whereas others use pepper technique , one skin entry point multiple entry point muscle . Consistently , however , intra-articular injection report . The investigator suspect elbow joint inflammation may underappreciated source pain lateral epicondylitis . Our hypothesis patient receive intra-articular injection great improvement compare patient receive either injection intra-tendinous injection . Statement Objectives 1 . To directly compare outcome patient lateral epicondylitis receive one three treatment option : 1. physical therapy rest 2. physical therapy intra-tendinous corticosteroid injection 3. physical therapy intra-articular corticosteroid injection . 2 . To blind patient assess physician/nurse research coordinator treatment receive duration study , order reduce effect potential bias . 3 . To collect outcome data , subjectively patient use proven outcome measure , objectively regularly space follow visit blind assessor . 4 . To collect comment data three treatment group regard outcomes related pain score , functional outcome recurrence symptom . Materials &amp; Methods This randomize , double-blind , control trial compare patient receive physical therapy rest , physical therapy intra-tendinous corticosteroid injection physical therapy intra-articular corticosteroid injection treatment lateral epicondylitis . To knowledge level I II study evaluate intra-articular elbow injection literature . All patient treat one hospital system one 2 location Truman Medical Center-Hospital Hill ( TMC-HH ) Truman Medical Center- Lakewood ( TMC-LW ) , principal investigator Our goal enroll patient seek care either primary care sport medicine physician orthopaedic surgeon persistent limit elbow pain . Potential subject meet inclusion criterion approach participate study . Enrollment continue sufficient number reach determine significant difference . Based power analysis total 82 patient enrol study . Lateral epicondylitis clinical diagnosis.1,2 In patient , diagnosis make base thorough history physical examination . Patients lateral epicondylitis typically present 4th 5th decade life vague , lateral elbow pain . The pain insidious onset without singular incite event . Symptoms typically dominant arm occur patient perform activity involve repeat wrist extension resistance . Patients typically mechanical symptom see loose body osteochondral lesion . Neurologic deficit alteration see condition . Systemic inflammatory diagnosis , rheumatoid arthritis systemic lupus erythematosus widespread vague joint pain confound diagnosis lateral elbow pain . Patients condition exclude . On physical examination , patient tenderness lateral elbow , typically origin ECRB tendon distal lateral epicondyle . This pain exacerbate resisted extension wrist , and/or resist extension long finger . In rare case elbow ROM limit . Standard elbow radiograph obtain rule fracture , arthritis , intra-articular loose body , deformity , osteonecrosis , osteochondral lesion , neoplasm subtle instability . Posterolateral rotatory instability ( PLRI ) elbow another source lateral elbow pain , posterolateral drawer test perform patient rule condition . Although cubital tunnel syndrome typically cause medial elbow pain , present non-focal , vague pain . A combination thorough neurologic exam distal extremity along compression cubital tunnel presence absence Tinel 's sign elbow use diagnosis presence condition . Patients concern shoulder wrist pathology cervical spine pathology exclude study .</detailed_description>
