	<brief_summary>This study design examine brain property placebo response chronic back pain patient . The investigator preliminary data indicating , blind clinical trial study neutral instruction regard treatment , chronic back pain ( CBP ) patient subdivide placebo responder non-responders , difference PREDICTABLE priori , brain activity . The result imply CBP placebo may clinical utility property study human brain imaging technique . In Phase I study , investigator seek identify brain image parameter predict propensity placebo response independent CBP cohort . In Phase II , investigator evaluate interaction placebo response medication treatment individual stratify placebo responder versus non-responders . This research design critically assess neurobiology placebo analgesia chronic pain partially-blind clinical trial .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Visit 1 ( week -3 ) : Screening visit ( 90 min ) : Participants evaluate inclusion/exclusion criterion complete informed consent document . A medical/pain history take physical exam complete physician participant ask rate current back pain intensity . Participants complete set 10 questionnaire ask health medical history , past current pain level , personality , emotion . Participants allow take break walk around time participant n't get tired filling questionnaire . Finally , participant blood drawn screening purpose include see kidney liver function ( investigator take 40 mL 8 teaspoon ) . Participants ask return 2 week baseline magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan . Participants ask discontinue current pain medication 14 day prior Visit 2 take rescue medication ( `` rescue '' medication also know acetaminophen/Tylenol Â® ) , give pain time ( see ) - investigator assess baseline amount pain . Participants inform may randomize placebo group and/or no-treatment group ( Visit 3 ) one qualifies continue study . Participants must , therefore , willing able stop take medication pain maximum 12 week study . Participants give acetaminophen ( 500 mg , 4 time per day ) take pain relief ( rescue medication ) , dose continue throughout study . Participants free stop participation point study . Participants randomize treatment arm may receive anti-inflammatory drug naproxen , since know increase risk stomach intestinal side effect , combine naproxen/esomeprazole drug regimen give participant provide protection type side effect . Visit 2 ( week -1 ) : Baseline Scan ( 90 min ) : Participants rate pain intensity , complete questionnaire , undergo brain scanning ( anatomical functional scan ) . Participants receive medication , use pain becomes much handle ( 500 mg four time per day maximum ) . The researcher ask participant often participant use `` rescue '' medication change health may experience since last visit . Visit 3 ( week 0 ) : Start Treatment Period Randomization ( 30-45 min ) : Participants rate pain intensity complete questionnaire . Participants randomize either drug ( placebo naproxen esomeprazole ) treatment group treatment group ; participant assign treatment group ( active placebo ) , neither participant clinical coordinator/assistant know group participant allocate . Enough medication give participant last next visit . The placebo group receive two placebo capsule twice daily active drug group receive one naproxen capsule ( 500mg ) one esomeprazole capsule ( 20mg ) twice daily ( morning night ) treatment period . The medication ( Naproxen Placebo ) need take least one full glass ( 8 oz ) water medication ( Esomeprazole Placebo ) take one hour meal . The researcher provide study medication ; participant randomize treatment group , participant receive rescue medication . The researcher ask participant often participant use `` rescue '' medication side effect participant experience since Visit 2 take place . Additional `` rescue '' medication give . Visit 4 ( week 3 ) : Continuing Assessment ( 30-45 min ) . The procedure describe Visit 3 repeat visit . The researcher ask participant often use `` rescue '' medication side effect experience since Visit 3 take place . As well , researcher ask often participant take study medication ( treatment group ) document total pill ingest . Visit 5 ( week 6 ) : End Treatment/Start Washout Final Scan ( 60-90 min ) : The procedure describe Visit 2 repeat visit . The researcher ask participant often reliably participant take medication ( treatment group ) , well often use `` rescue '' medication side effect experience since Visit 4 take place . Participants receive `` rescue '' medication upcoming 3 week . Visit 6 ( week 9 ) : Final Visit/End Washout ( 30-45 min ) : Participants return complete questionnaire , brain scan do . The researcher ask participant often use `` rescue '' medication side effect experience since Visit 5 take place . If participant one treatment group , participant ask return study medication rescue medication time , treatment stop visit .</detailed_description>
