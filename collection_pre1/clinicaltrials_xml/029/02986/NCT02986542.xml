	<brief_summary>The use USI ease practical application interventional procedure , reduce complication procedure duration . For vascular intervention ultrasound imaging , short- long-section image vascular structure perform . Both technique advantage disadvantage . This study aim compare success rate femoral artery catheterization use image technique .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The research include newborn undergo open heart surgery patient require arterial monitoring neonatal intensive care unit . Eighty patient require femoral artery cannulation randomize closed envelope method separate two group USI in-plane technique ( Group A ) USI out-of-plane technique ( Group B ) . The intervention perform single experienced individual . The preparation duration , puncture duration , number puncture , number unsuccessful arterial puncture , development hematoma complication record group compare . If 3 unsuccessful attempt procedure ended.1 . Patients undergo KVC surgery patient require arterial catheterization neonatal intensive care unit ( case pulmonary disease , electrolyte disorder , metabolic disease , sepsis require frequent blood sample ) EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR STUDY VOLUNTEERS 1 . Local infection 2 . Coagulopathy CLINICAL END-POINTS ( MEASURED VARIABLES ) 1 . Distance femoral artery skin , distance femoral artery inguinal ligament , femoral artery diameter , femoral artery vein location property 2 . Preparation duration , number puncture , complication develop procedure</detailed_description>
