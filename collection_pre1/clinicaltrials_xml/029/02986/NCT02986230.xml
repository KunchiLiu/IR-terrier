	<detailed_description>The objective project implement evaluate effectiveness sophisticated Web-based , electronic health record ( EHR ) -linked clinical decision support ( CDS ) system design improve primary secondary cancer preventive care . To achieve objective , link EHR data evidence-based cancer prevention algorithm secure Web site create : ( ) identify point care eligible patient date cancer prevention intervention ; ( b ) present patient primary care provider ( PCP ) and/or key member primary care team , certify medical assistant ( CMA ) , appropriate evidence-based primary cancer prevention intervention cancer screen option point care . The Cancer Prevention-CDS focus breast cancer screen woman age 50-74 , colorectal cancer screen sex age 50-75 , cervical cancer screen woman age 21-65 , human papilloma virus ( HPV ) vaccination sex age 11-26 , referral weight management smoking cessation adult age 18 old . Effectiveness assess cluster-randomizing 30 primary care clinic roughly 285 PCPs 153,000 study-eligible patient one three experimental condition : Group 1 : PCP-focused CDS intervention PCP trigger use CDS system engage patient appropriate cancer prevention strategy . Group 2 : SDMT-focused CDS intervention CMA trigger use CDS system along additional share decision making tool interact patient engage appropriate cancer prevention strategy see PCP , approve discus plan patient . Group 3 : clinic provide usual care intervention-related activity relate cancer prevention . With 10 clinic , 95 PCPs , 51,000 potentially eligible patient per study arm , study formally test hypothesis Groups 1 2 superior Group 3 18-month follow-up period respect : ( ) significantly high rate appropriate screen breast , cervix , colorectal cancer , define United States Preventive Services Task Force ; ( b ) significantly high rate human papillomavirus ( HPV ) vaccination male female age 11-26 year . The investigator posit Groups 1 2 high short-term health care cost well long-term cost-effectiveness Group 3 . The Consolidated Framework Implementation Research ( CFIR ) RE-AIM conceptual framework use guide implementation planning , organization , conduct , impact evaluation intervention large rural healthcare system . This project engage rural population substantial healthcare disparity gap receipt primary secondary cancer prevention . Results advance dissemination implementation research method reduce health disparity improve healthcare million medically under-served area .</detailed_description>
