	<brief_title>The Effect Structured Feedback Live Surgical Performance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The American Association Gynecologic Laparoscopists ( AAGL ) Accreditation Council Graduate Medical Education ( ACGME ) endeavor implement structure standardization fellowship minimally invasive gynecologic surgical program ( FMIGS ) obstetric gynecology residency program respectively . Educational objective explicitly delineate . Though fellowship residency educational objective well round , include development skill become leader educator field minimally invasive gynecologic surgery ( MIGS ) general obstetrics gynecology , one main objective fellowship residency train attainment surgical skill . This ensured requirement breadth surgical exposure include vaginal surgery , hysteroscopy , traditional laparoscopy , management surgical complication , minimally invasive hysterectomy , urogynecologic procedure , gastrointestinal surgery , urinary tract surgery , reproductive surgery , surgical management common gynecologic condition endometriosis . Minimum case requirement implement provide guidance FMIGS residency program . In addition , trainee require log surgical case information utilized FMIGS residency program site inspection well feedback surgical competency . Despite standardization effort AAGL ACGME , FMIGS obstetric gynecology residency curriculum still evolution . There likely still great variation surgical exposure program . In addition , though regular feedback requirement training program , process likely unstructured subjective ; base case log , self-assessments , feedback faculty surgeon . There thus critical need develop standardize , objective , timely , actionable feedback methodology facilitate program oversight ensure FMIGS fellows obstetrics gynecology resident achieve surgical competency throughout training . In absence structure feedback model , remain difficult optimize FMIGS fellowship obstetrics gynecology resident training , provide objective measurement impact train surgical performance patient outcomes . . The long-term goal study assist develop method surgical assessment facilitate program oversight , allow fellow , resident , program director identify specific skill set need improvement , monitor progress skill acquisition , clearly objectively document achievement milestone throughout training . The study 's overall objective determine consistent structure feedback use crowd source impact time complete task well surgical performance measure GOALS GEARS score . The central hypothesis fellows resident receive consistent structure feedback sustained period time shorter task time , overall improve performance , great satisfaction fellows resident receive traditional feedback . The rationale work provide focus supportive data large-scale study surgical skill acquisition development . This study seek establish effect regular structure feedback surgical performance use crowd source video assessment GOALS GEARS randomize control trial . The study hypothesize regular structured assessment lead great measurable improvement performance , define change GOALS GEARS score , traditional feedback method well time complete specific procedure .</detailed_description>
