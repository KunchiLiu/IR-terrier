	<brief_summary>Preterm delivery ( PTD ) , together low birthweight ( LBW ) , lead cause infant death illness , affect 500,000 birth annual medical cost $ 26 billion U.S. year . Identifying changeable risk factor reduce PTD consider top research priority . Recent research show genital herpes infection ( HSV ) associate increased risk PTD LBW . More importantly , treat infection , include infection symptom , use readily available antiviral medication effective remove risk due HSV . Thus , early identification treatment HSV pregnant woman could effective way prevent PTD LBW . Currently , many pregnant woman HSV infection , especially symptom , choose treat due ( ) lack demonstrated benefit treatment ( b ) general hesitance use medication pregnancy due safety concern fetus . Thus , emerge evidence increase risk PTD/LBW associate HSV infection , untreated , treatment effectiveness anti-herpes medication significantly change current treatment paradigm among pregnant woman . This evidence also provide new hope effectively treat HSV infection among pregnant woman , especially 3rd trimester , could lead new method reduce PTD LBW reduce racial/ethnic disparity risk due high rate infection minority group . Thus , examine effectiveness treat HSV pregnant woman reduce adverse pregnancy outcome , investigator propose conduct prospective cohort study two-stage design combine large pregnant woman population ( N=90,000 ) Stage I identify Kaiser Permanente Northern California ( KPNC ) electronic medical record ( EMRs ) , Stage II sample collect detail information additional factor might muddle understanding issue . This study address follow : ( 1 ) Does treat HSV infection pregnant woman reduce risk PTD LBW ? ( 2 ) Does time treatment pregnancy influence treatment effectiveness ? ( 3 ) Do factor influence treatment effectiveness ? ( 4 ) Does HSV infection pregnancy , untreated , increase risk PTD LBW , compare infection ? Answers question valuable pregnant woman clinician , directly address concern make treatment decision</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparative Effectiveness Treatment Options Genital Herpes Infection Reduce Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preterm delivery ( PTD ) , along low birthweight ( LBW ) , lead cause perinatal mortality morbidity . In U.S. , 12 % livebirths PTDs , result $ 26 billion medical cost annually . The impact infant health staggering cost make PTD one top research priority PCORI , AHRQ , Institute Medicine ( IOM ) World Health Organization ( WHO ) , due lack effective intervention reduce PTD . Genital herpes infection prevalent , recent WHO estimation 500 million people worldwide infect . Treating pregnant woman genital herpes infection , especially 3rd trimester , show reduce risk PTD LBW , thus effective intervention reduce PTD/LBW . However , effectiveness benefit treat genital herpes reduce PTD LBW need demonstrated order incorporate treatment decision make process . Currently , many pregnant woman choose treat genital herpes due general aversion take medication pregnancy safety fetus , lack demonstrate evidence benefit . Paradoxically , choice treatment genital herpes may adversely impact fetal health , lead PTD LBW . Given pregnant woman frequently prefer treatment , study urgently need establish risk-benefit profile treatment treatment genital herpes infection context improve fetal health , include time treatment ( 3rd trimester ) . This study design provide clear evidence treatment effectiveness real-world clinical practice , risk-benefit profile inform treatment decision pregnant woman clinician . Study Aims : This propose comparative effectiveness study address follow question : 1 . Does treat genital herpes infection pregnant woman reduce risk adverse pregnancy outcome include PTD LBW ? ( treated vs. untreated ) 2 . Does time treatment pregnancy influence treatment effectiveness reduce adverse pregnancy outcome ( PTD LBW ) ? ( head-to-head comparison treatment timing : 3rd trimester vs. 3rd trimester ) . 3 . Do treatment metric , include treatment duration , dosage , compliance , impact treatment effectiveness reduce risk PTD LBW ? 4 . Does treatment effectiveness vary depend type ( severity ) underlie genital herpes infection ? ( e.g. , treat symptomatic genital herpes infection vs. treat latent/asymptomatic genital herpes ) 5 . Does genital herpes infection pregnancy , untreated , increase risk PTD LBW , compare genital herpes infection ? ( untreated vs. control without genital herpes ) In addition , study especially relevant address racial disparity , give minority pregnant woman higher rate genital herpes infection PTD : 3 time infection rate 150 % high PTD rate among African-Americans compare Whites . Thus , demonstrate effectiveness treat genital herpes reduce PTD could lead reduction exist racial disparity PTD rate . Study Description Overall study design : The investigator conduct prospective cohort study two-stage design base 90,000 pregnant KPNC member real-world clinical practice . Due increase fetal risk untreated genital herpes infection , randomize pregnant woman infection treat untreated group present ethical problem , thus feasible . Our innovative two-stage prospective cohort design , leverage large membership comprehensive electronic medical record ( EMR ) data , robust alternative option examine comparative effectiveness treat genital herpes infection pregnant woman reduce PTD LBW . Comparators : Three comparison make : 1 . When assess treatment effectiveness , woman infection choose receive treatment serve comparator ( untreated ) . This comparator frequently prefer treatment option choose pregnant woman due reluctance use medication pregnancy , base predominant concern safety develop fetus well lack evidence treat genital herpes infection beneficial fetus . This comparator also make comparison group comparable control confound indication . 2 . When assess time treatment effectiveness ( vs. start 3rd trimester ) , receive treatment 3rd trimester use comparator . Using comparator allow head-to-head comparison timing treatment . 3 . When assess effect choose treat pregnancy , woman without underlie genital herpes infection receipt treatment serve comparator ( normal control ) . This comparison provide evidence increase risk PTD LBW genital herpes infection treat pregnancy . Our comparators allow u control confound indication ( genital herpes , type severity ) . Our EMR contain extensive question risk factor , include lifestyle factor , 90,000 mother-infant dyad . Through unique two-stage study design , investigator collect additional information , interview , subsample woman allow control additional confounders . Multiple statistical methodology , accordance PCORI 's methodology standard , employ analytic plan ( e.g. , propensity score , , instrumental variable method ) ensure compatibility comparison group .</detailed_description>
