	<brief_summary>We would suggest conduct `` VOLUME-2 '' study , extension ongoing `` VOLUME '' study subject already include . After completion VOLUME study , study directly extend `` open-label design '' . All participant , agree pursue , either `` Placebo '' `` CG428 '' , receive CG428 treatment additional six-month period . VOLUME-2 study would ideal timely enable interruption product use . The Primary Objective observe longer period efficacy CG428 ( 12 month : 6months Volume + 6 month Volume-2 ) order well discriminate later non-responder population . Secondary Objectives : - Evaluate far CG428 improve hair-pattern ( reach plateau constant progression ) - Evaluate motivation adherence subject - Long term safety</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The research team Cancer Education Center Samsung Comprehensive Cancer Center study CIA impact distress psychosocial well-being since 2008 . We find half breast cancer patient experience high distress due CIA , cancer treatment , distress strongly associate negative body image , overall health status , psychosocial well-being . In recent prospective cohort study , assess skin hair change pattern , 6 month chemotherapy 61 volunteer . We find majority patient still experience CIA 6 month completion chemotherapy . Actually , hair diameter 6th month chemotherapy recover baseline level . Permanent chemotherapy-induced alopecia , define absent incomplete hair regrowth ≥6 month post-chemotherapy , report 53 74 % . Like CIA , permanent CIA also lack recognition underserved regardless patient ' need . The first botanical blend Legacy Healthcare develop patented Cellium . Cellium compose 4 botanical ( Allium cepa L. , Citrus limon L. , Theobroma cacao L. , Paullinia cupana ) . The first product derive Cellium topical lotion male female alopecia , CG210 . Based safety efficacy data , EMA ( European Medicines Agency ) consider CG210 eligible European centralize herbal medicine registration . CG428 second product derive Cellium . CG428 contain exact ingredient CG210 , different dosage . Legacy Healthcare conduct pilot study CG428 Japan . The trial include female cancer survivor experience permanent/persistent CIA 12 . Based result , several cancer treatment center Japan start recommend product compassionate basis.We therefore hypothesize investigated topical lotion may mitigate impact protracted permanent CIA cancer survivor restore normalized apoptotic process hair follicular cell reduce acute , well chronic inflammation scalp , two issue may remain unsettled follow anticancer treatment . While consider subject include `` VOLUME '' study , appear majority cancer survivor recover full hair pattern even 3 year cancer treatment . This per se interest data , new significant knowledge reveal persistent chemotherapy induce apopecia ( CIA ) common anticipate . While consider subject include `` VOLUME '' study , appear majority cancer survivor recover full hair pattern even 3 year cancer treatment . This per se interest data , new significant knowledge reveal persistent chemotherapy induce apopecia ( CIA ) common anticipate . The `` VOLUME '' study could fact two major repercussion : addition give information CG428 efficacy , help good define persistent CIA improve thereby scientific knowledge condition . Considering high prevalence poor literature persistent CIA , appear important study condition . To end , would suggest conduct `` VOLUME-2 '' study , extension ongoing `` VOLUME '' study subject already include . This study aim evaluation Longer observation ( 12 month : 6months Volume + 6 month Volume-2 ) permit well discriminate later non-responder population . This open-label , single center , observation study breast cancer survivor VOLUME participant . Hair condition parameter 31 breast cancer survivor previously include VOLUME study ( randomize control trial evaluate effect CG428 topical hair lotion chemotherapy induce alopecia complete December , 2016 ) assess . The participation du extension Volume-2 study propose patient last visit Volume study ( Month 6 ) The `` VOLUME '' study could fact two major repercussion : addition give information CG428 efficacy , help good define persistent CIA improve thereby scientific knowledge condition . Considering high prevalence poor literature persistent CIA , appear important study condition . To end , would suggest conduct `` VOLUME-2 '' study , extension ongoing `` VOLUME '' study subject already include .
