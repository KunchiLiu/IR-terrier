	<detailed_description>Progress area diabetic kidney research lead new therapeutic development limit . Indeed , new medicine indicate treatment chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) approve since ARB 's become standard care nearly 15 year ago . Several factor explain limited progress include limited ; ) animal cell culture model recapitulate human DKD b ) human genetic study far fail identify reproducible genetic variant associate DKD c ) clinical manifestation DKD heterogeneous might even change since original description ) DKD clinical diagnosis clear percentage patient histological disease . Laboratory mouse serve invaluable tool understand human disease development . As mouse genetic tool become readily available , enable u perform time cell type specific gene manipulation animal generate disease model understand contribution specific pathway . Unfortunately , mouse model recapitulate human diabetic kidney disease animal develop early DKD lesion ; mesangial expansion mild albuminuria11 . Most model develop arterial hyalinosis , tubulointerstitial fibrosis decline glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) ; hallmark progressive DKD . There several fundamental difference gene expression pattern physiology human murine kidney . Such difference may explain lack translatability mouse human pharmacological approach aim treat DKD . This seem general trend disease area well ( example Alzheimer 's disease ) , lead recent movement toward translational clinical research increase reliance human sample . Human genetic study make paradigm-shifting observation relatively rare monogenic form kidney disease ( include polycystic kidney disease focal segmental glomerulosclerosis ) . Diabetic CKD hand follow complex polygenic pattern . Currently , powerful method define genetics complex disease DKD genome wide association ( GWAS ) , association polymorphisms disease state test . Prior study indicate complex trait , DKD , genetic polymorphism associate disease state localize non-coding region genome12,13 . Moreover , genetic architecture diabetic kidney disease characterize several large collaboration currently address issue14 . Thus , next challenge define target gene , target cell type mode dysregulation cause non-coding snip ( SNPs15 ) . Such study require large collection human tissue sample disease relevant organ . Diabetic kidney disease ( DKD ) remain clinical diagnosis . Subjects CKD presence diabetes albuminuria consider diabetic nephropathy . Such definition use clinical practice research study include clinical trial . Studies perform 1980 provide basis practice16,17 . Investigators stage DKD progressive disease , begin loss small amount albumin urine ( 30-300mg/day ; know stage microalbuminuria , high albuminuria , occult incipient nephropathy ) , large amount ( &gt; 300mg/day ; know macroalbuminuria , high albuminuria overt nephropathy ) , follow progressive decline kidney function ( eGFR ) , renal impairment ultimately ESRD 17-19 . This paradigm prove useful clinical study , especially type 1 diabetes , identify cohort increase risk adverse health outcome . However , boundary stag DKD artificial relationship urinary albumin excretion adverse health outcome log-linear clinical practice . Indeed , American Diabetes Association recently abandon stag albuminuria ( ACR ) more-straightforward [ ACR &gt; 30 mg/g , ( albuminuria present ) ; ACR &lt; 30 mg/g ( albuminuria absent ) ] criterion . Moreover , many patient , especially type 2 diabetes , follow classical course modern clinical practice . For example , many subject DKD manifest excessive urinary albumin loss20 . Indeed , 28 % UKPDS cohort develop moderate severe renal impairment , half precede albuminuria . In Diabetes Control Complications Trial ( DCCT ) , 11 % patient type 1 diabetes develop eGFR &lt; 60 ml/min/1.73m2 , 40 % never experience overt nephropathy21 . In addition , patient microalbuminuria progressively exhibit increase urinary albumin excretion classical paradigm treatment-induced spontaneous 'remission ' albuminuria widely observed22,23 . Consequently , individual microalbuminuria may better regard increase risk develop progressive renal disease ( well cardiovascular disease diabetic complication ) , rather actually DKD per se . While last 40 year become evident original description DKD need revision , alternative criterion emerge give lack solid data correlation histopathological ( gold standard ) DKD diagnosis clinical manifestation . It also possible , introduction well glycemic control anti-renin ( RAAS ) blockade , disease evolve necessitating new observational cohort understand clinical disease course manifestation . Diabetic kidney disease present variable rate kidney function decline24 . Data large observational cohort indicate GFR decline frequently follow linear course . Several group work model GFR decline pattern patient . Such study contribute emphasize patient term `` rapid progressors '' . There consensus definition rapid progression . Many study define rapid progressors patient great 3 cc/year GFR decrease alternative cut point even 10 cc/year also use . Identification clinical characterization rapid progressors become center several large scale effort patient would likely need intensive clinical management25 . Furthermore recent post-hoc analysis Diabetic Nephropathy ( IDNT RENAAL ) study indicate clinical trial outcome mostly driven small number subject unusually rapidly progressive GFR decline i.e . subject display characteristic rapid progressors . While investigator still await accurate description , biomarker clinical descriptive study yield several interesting observation . Albuminuria remain one strongest risk factor `` FDA-approved '' ( hard ) renal outcome ; double serum creatinine , dialysis death . Indeed late study indicate use 4 6 variable model , include albuminuria , age , sex , serum phosphate , serum calcium serum albumin C-statistics score 0.84-0.91 predict ESRD 26,27 . During last year several new biomarkers identify potentially identify patient increase risk rapid loss kidney function . For example blood urinary level kidney injury molecule ( KIM1 ) show promise identify patient risk kidney function decline . Recently , investigator show circulate level tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 2 level identify patient rapidly decline renal function 28 . While marker generate increased interest ; critical question remain ; patient follow rapid decline kidney function ?</detailed_description>
