	<brief_summary>Medical scientist find people diabetes take drug Metformin less age-related disease take treatment researcher believe may prevent numerous disease condition effect old people . In addition , metformin extend lifespan animal model human disease . The purpose study see take Metformin cause change blood cell consistent improve health longevity people diabetes . In study Metformin compare placebo . A placebo substance , like sugar pill , think effect participant disease condition . In study participant either receive active study medication , Metformin placebo active . Placebos use research study see drug study really effect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The number old adult project increase dramatically 2050 . Aging-related disease condition still seriously compromise quality life among old adult . Several pharmaceutical agent , metformin , test extend lifespan delay aging-related disease dysfunction mice . Metformin , biguanide antidiabetic drug , reduces risk develop type-2 diabetes person risk one-third adverse effect ( e.g. , gastrointestinal irritation ) . Metformin prevents type-2 diabetes primarily decrease hepatic glucose synthesis , well enhance insulin sensitivity increase peripheral glucose uptake . The molecular mechanism remain unclear , although number potential mechanism activation AMP-activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) inhibition mitochondrial glycerophosphate dehydrogenase propose . The fact metformin treatment person type-2 diabetes associate reduced risk aging-related disease condition , include cardiovascular disease , cancer cognitive decline support possibility beneficial effect metformin healthy aging . It imperative capitalize lead extend health span among old adult . To translate animal finding human intervention trial , appropriate age biomarkers need . Methylomic transcriptomic profile relevant cell may reflect molecular feature mediate effect genetic environmental factor aging-related functional decline disease . The role monocyte implicate development many aging-related disease cardiovascular disease , cancer neurodegenerative disease . In cross-sectional association study 1,200 monocyte sample , identify 1,794 age-associated methylation sit 2,704 age-associated transcript , over-represented two network ( autophagy oxidative phosphorylation ) suggestive decline function age . Both autophagy oxidative phosphorylation consider key contributor age process , dysfunction link aging-related disease . Changes aging-related omic biomarkers may early indicator cellular damage disruption eventually lead age-related dysfunction . Assessment age biomarkers response therapeutic intervention may also provide molecular insight personalize treatment . The investigator propose pilot study examine change aging-related omic profile 3 month metformin treatment 30 monocyte sample old adult use randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled crossover study design . Our overarch goal pilot study evaluate utility use aging-related omic biomarkers indicator pharmacologic response anti-aging therapeutic intervention trial follow specific aim . Although pilot study sufficient power definitively test aim , provide essential preliminary data develop full scale research program . - Aim 1A : To test effect metformin treatment transcriptomic profile relate functional change human monocyte , - Aim 1B : To explore effect metformin treatment methylomic profile human monocyte , - Aim 2 : To investigate longitudinal relationship transcriptional functional change human monocytes metformin treatment - Aim 3 : To test effect metformin treatment frailty aging-related physical cognitive measure investigate longitudinal relationship change transcriptional change . A randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled crossover trial 30 participant use metformin match placebo use . In absence treatment sequence interaction effect , design increase study power evaluate treatment effect allow participant his/her control . The period effect may minimum primary outcome , methylation transcriptional measure , relatively stable overtime .</detailed_description>
