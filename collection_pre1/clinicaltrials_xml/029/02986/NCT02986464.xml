	<brief_summary>Procedural pain intense often undertreated pain associate burn injury . The use analgesic always provide optimal relief accompany several side effect . Indeed , child burn injury still experience severe pain intensity procedures despite fact dos analgesic use population almost double last twenty year . Current guideline pediatric procedural pain management recommend combination non-pharmacological pharmacological intervention enhance pain management decrease numerous side effect analgesic . Distraction identify among effective non-pharmacological intervention pain diverts child 's attention attractive element , hinder perception painful stimulus . Virtual reality method active distraction offer child multi-sensory immersive interaction find many application pain management adult patient . However , study test efficacy distraction virtual reality procedural pain anxiety child burn injury . This RCT follow pilot study ( NCT02794103 ) aim assess feasibility virtual reality prototype develop specifically hydrotherapy room child seven year old relief procedural pain child burn injury . The aim RCT evaluate effectiveness virtual reality prototype relieve procedural pain child 6 month 7 year old undergoing hydrotherapy session burn injury .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Virtual Reality Distraction Procedural Pain Management Children With Burn Injuries : Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Preliminary data pilot study show virtual reality prototype instal around tank hydrotherapy room feasible acceptable method distraction n't interfere work healthcare professional could use non-pharmacological method pain management . A clinical trial need ass effectiveness intervention procedural pain relief . The pilot study also informative feasibility study design measurement use . The method section modify adapt consequently upcoming trial . METHODS : Design : Within-subject/crossover study design . Each child serve control receive standard experimental treatment hydrotherapy session randomize order . Sample Setting : Convenience sample surgical-trauma burn unit CHU Ste-Justine , child admit unit day hospital burn injury . The intervention take place hydrotherapy room CHU Ste-Justine . Interventions . A ) Standard pharmacological treatment per unit 's protocol . B ) VR distraction use virtual reality prototype instal around tank hydrotherapy room . The prototype develop collaboration Society Arts Technology ( SAT ) Montreal provide immersive interactive experience burn child hydrotherapy tank . The prototype develop several meeting researcher , designer engineer surgical trauma team CHU Ste-Justine . Meetings follow ergonomic study hydrotherapy room meet unit 's patient ' specification ensure n't interfere healthcare professional work.The video game develop team personalize care content tailor child 's developmental stage maximize feeling immersion minimize cybersickness , approve team healthcare professional pediatric burn care . Study proceeding : Hydrotherapy session typically last 20 40 minute . The duration divide two sequence duration ( 10 20 minute ) participant receives care healthcare professional . For one sequence , standard treatment administer sequence , patient receive standard treatment addition Virtual Reality via screen around tank randomize order . Measures : Pain anxiety measure take treatment session Baseline ( T1 ) , middle first sequence session ( T2 ) middle second sequence session ( T3 ) follow measure healthcare professional ` satisfaction level via questionnaire develop pretested team session ( T4 ) . Data collect average dos analgesic administer session , side effect experience . Data analysis : Quantitative analysis . Mean difference pain score sequence compare use Wilcoxon test .</detailed_description>
