	<brief_summary>An association suggest several disease include cancer IARC classify several pesticide carcinogenic , probably carcinogenic . There need good characterisation environmental pesticide exposure identification suitable biomarkers exposure effect . A good understanding impact pesticide exposure metabolomic , transcriptomic epigenetic change , essential strengthen epidemiological hypothesis association several cancer type . The main objective project validate GIS ( geographic information system ) base method ass environmental pesticide exposure , use environmental ( contamination housedust ) biological ( blood urine sample ) measure . The project aim investigate potential link housedust contamination biological measure healthy non-smoking male resident explore impact environmental pesticide exposure metabolomics , transcriptomic epigenetic parameter .</brief_summary>
