	<brief_title>Study CPI-0610 Patients With Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Optional tumor biopsy obtain prior Day 1 CPI-0610 administration . - CPI-0610 administered 200mg orally daily 14 consecutive day follow 7-day break . The 14 day CPI-0610 dose 7-day break together constitute 1 cycle treatment . The dose adjust body weight body surface area . - Patients instructed take daily dose approximately time day . Each dose take glass water consume short time possible—e.g. , within 5 minute . Patients instruct swallow tablet whole chew cut . - Doses may take either without food . - If vomiting occurs course treatment , re-dosing patient allow next schedule dose . - If patient forgets take his/her daily morning dose , he/she take CPI-0610 within 6 hour miss dose . If 6 hour pass , day 's dose omit , patient resume treatment next schedule dose . - Repeat optional tumor biopsy obtain day 8 CPI-0610 treatment . Toxicities Dosing Delays/Dose Modifications During cycle treatment , CPI-0610 continue administer planned unless CTCAE grade 3-4 toxicity occur . In case CPI-0610-related neutropenia and/or thrombocytopenia , dose plan continue long ANC remain &gt; 0.5x109/L platelet count remain &gt; 25x109/L . Should either ANC platelet count fall values—become CTCAE grade 4—dosing CPI-0610 interrupted . CPI-0610 dosing within plan 14 day treatment resume ANC &gt; 0.75x109/L platelet count &gt; 50x109/L . In addition , dose within cycle treatment resume interruption result omission 2 plan 14 day dose . If possible resume dose within plan 14 day treatment , attempt make make missed dose CPI-0610 . If 2 plan 14 day therapy omit , treatment resume new cycle treatment , ANC &gt; 1x109/L platelet count &gt; 75x109/L . In addition , toxicity consider related CPI-0610 must resolve CTCAE grade 1 baseline . If patient fails meet above-cited criterion retreatment , initiation next cycle treatment delay one week . Following additional week treatment , next cycle may begin patient 's ANC &gt; 1x109/L platelet count &gt; 75x109/L . In addition , toxicity consider related CPI-0610 must resolve CTCAE grade 1 baseline . If 28 day start one cycle start next , patient longer receive CPI-0610 therapy unless patient 's MPNST stable respond therapy . Then consideration may give resume treatment low dose level discuss Sponsor Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) . When reduction dose CPI-0610 required , re-escalation dose permit . Exceptions toxicity delay CTCAE elevation alkaline phosphatase uric acid &lt; 72 hour grade 3 fatigue . When laboratory abnormality form basis treatment decision , confirm repeat test new blood sample procedure . Optimal therapy vomit diarrhea base physician preference consideration prohibit medication list appendix . G-CSF may use treat patient develop dose-limiting neutropenia , per institutional guideline , follow discontinuation CPI-0610 treatment . However , G-CSF may use CPI-0610 administration treatment break . Patients dose reduction CPI-0610 unless grade 3-4 toxicity occur retreatment possible within 28 day period . Then patient withdrawn study unless patient 's MPNST respond stable therapy . Then consideration may give resume treatment low dose level discuss Sponsor IRB . When reduction dose CPI-0610 required , re-escalation dose permit . Patients whose treatment interrupt permanently discontinue toxicity must follow toxicity resolve stabilizes .</detailed_description>
