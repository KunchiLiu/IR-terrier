	<brief_title>Treatment With Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Cocaine Addiction : Clinical Response Functional Connectivity .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) show reduce crave cocaine addict short term . However , study long term clinical cognitive effect sustain rTMS therapy . Moreover , clinical improvement decline could relate long term change brain structure function . The purpose study investigate short long term clinical cognitive effect repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( rTMS ) 5 Hz and/or 10 Hz frequency leave dorsolateral prefrontal cortex cocaine dependent patient examine possible change brain structure functional connectivity associate intervention . For purpose investigator recruit cocaine dependent patient stimulate use rTMS acute intervention ( twice day 2 week ) maintenance intervention ( twice week 12 month ) . The investigator follow patient determine clinical outcome . The investigator also measure clinical , cognitive brain structural functional connectivity ass change relate intervention short long term ( measurement : baseline , 2 week , 3 month , 6 month 12 month ) . Procedure : The project consist : Screening Visit , Part 1 Part 2 . First , screen visit , clinical interview conduct test apply select study participant meet inclusion exclusion criterion . Baseline clinical , cognitive neuroimaging data acquire . The cognitive neuroimaging data exploratory , associate outcome measure . Part 1 study entail determination rTMS target frequency ( 5 10 Hz ) Part 2 ( long term stimulation ) . In Part 1 , participant randomly assign one four treatment leg rTMS ( 10Hz , 10Hz-Sham , 5Hz , 5Hz-Sham ) . Participants receive 20 session rTMS ( intervention sham ) , twice per day 10 consecutive day . Each session last approximately 35 minute . At 2 week , investigator evaluate short term effect treatment measure clinical , cognitive neuroimaging change select frequency stimulation effective term clinical improvement , also term rate secondary effect . Our hypothesis 5 Hz effective 10 Hz without high rate secondary effect ( i.e . seizure ) . In Part 2 study , sham group end invite treatment condition although data consider later phase . Here maintenance phase start ( long term ) , rTMS perform twice week 12 month use target frequency ( 5 10 Hz ) . Clinical , cognitive neuroimaging data acquire 3 , 6 12 month .</detailed_description>
