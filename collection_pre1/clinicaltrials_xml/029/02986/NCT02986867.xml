	<brief_title>SAbR-induced Innate Immunity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Within 2 week plan SAbR , patient core biopsy lesion receive SAbR . Laboratory value obtain prior biopsy . Once laboratory value find within safe margin biopsy , multiple ( approximately 5 ) core biopsy obtain 18-guage 19-gauge needle CT US guidance . Tissue snap frozen liquid nitrogen immediately transfer laboratory Dr. Zhijian `` James '' Chen , PhD , Professor , Department Molecular Biology NA6.120 , University Texas Southwestern Medical Center , 6000 Harry Hines Blvd , Dallas , TX 75390-9148 , 214-648-1145 ( phone ) attention : Beethoven Ramirez Dr. Tuo Li . SAbR administer per guideline UTSW single 24-27Gy three 10-14 Gy/fraction fraction total 33-48Gy . Lesions receive SAbR call `` radiate '' lesion . Prior irradiated lesion exclude . SABR administer within 2 week study initial core biopsy . The SAbR dose fractionation scheme generate deliver potent dose ablate target lesion time maximize immune response . Since multiple study show influx lymphocyte monocyte tumor irradiation ( Lugade , 2005 ; Rubner , 2012 ; Takeshima , 2010 ; Lee , 2009 ) since cell play critical role antigen presentation initiation adaptive immune response , multiple fraction irradiation would kill infiltrate immunocytes , discourage . Therefore single fraction three fraction treatment regimen recommend , single fraction treatment prefer three fraction . Due normal organ toxicity limit dose constraint , sometimes three fraction treatment must undertake case recommend treatment course complete within 7- 10 day -- preferably 5 business day . Radiation dose-immune response study show linear increase immune response increase dose per fraction radiation without demonstration plateau ( Lugade , 2005 ; Lee , 2009 ; Reits , 2006 ; Schaue , 2012 ) . Two study compare 15Gy x 1 vs 5Gy x3 , 20Gy x1 v 5Gy x4 show superior immune response generate single fraction radiation ( Lugade , 2005 ; Lee , 2009 ) . Clinical experience oligometastatic patient treat 1-5 site disease also show increase progression-free survival increase radiation dose per fraction ( Salama , 2012 ) . A dose less 7.5 Gy per fraction demonstrate low induction systemic IFN-γ produce cell ( Schaue , 2012 ) , previous phase II study mRCC patient treat HD IL-2 singe fraction 8Gy irradiation single lesion show overall improvement response rate ( Redman , 1998 ) . Therefore 8Gy per fraction lowest permit dose study use administer three fraction regimen describe prescription dose table . Investigators discretion choose either biologically equivalent dose level use one three fraction , although single fraction prefer three fraction treatment . Treating physician discretion select number location sit treat multiple site disease present . Maximum number lesion treat deem feasible per treat radiation oncologist . However , purpose protocol , single site study must safely amenable repeat core biopsy . Thus , single site study either subcutaneous tissue , node , isolated mass liver . The gross target/tumor volume -- GTV least 2 cm3 size , correspond roughly 1.5 cm diameter tumor . This ensure adequate tumor volume therapy biopsy therefore adequate tumor cell roughly 108 -109 cells/cm3 ( Del Monte , 2009 ) kill antigen presentation . Treating physician choose dose base establish plan guideline center include ability respect normal tissue tolerance . Within 24 + 6 hour first SAbR , second core biopsy `` target '' irradiate lesion perform identically first biopsy .</detailed_description>
