	<brief_summary>At point patient [ 11C ] -Acetate PET study , compare standard clinical MR imaging . Abbreviations : XRT - radiation therapy ; TMZ - temozolomide ( chemotherapy ) Quantitative Image Data Analysis : The [ 11C ] -Acetate uptake tumor site image analyze qualitatively visual assessment , quantitatively use standard uptake value ( SUV ) tumor relative contralateral normal brain , parameter obtain compartmental modeling dynamic data .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . [ 11C ] Acetate Administration [ 11C ] Acetate administer Clinical PET Facility locate 2nd floor Clements Imaging Building UT Southwestern . Upon arrival , patient opportunity question answer regarding procedure . The patient one intravenous line place prior [ 11C ] Acetate administration . The patient receive low-dose CT portion PET/CT scan , [ 11C ] Acetate administer intravenously approximately 1 min dose 0.3 mCi/kg ( maximum 30 mCi ) follow saline flush . The injection image procedure terminate patient exhibit anaphylaxis , significant dyspnea chest pain . The administer physician stay patient least 15 min injection remain Clinical PET Facility duration image procedure . All adverse event occur post [ 11C ] Acetate infusion record within 24-hour period . The adverse event specifically monitor infusion include localize discomfort IV injection site , pain , respiratory difficulty , flushing , dizziness , pruritus/rash , symptom could secondary anaphylactic reaction . The subject instruct report subjective symptom sensory change note . Patients image Siemens Biograph 64 slice PET CT scanner . After place patient scanner secure head head restraint , low dose CT brain acquire . Images 3 mm slice thickness space 1.5 mm interval reconstruct 300 mm field view . The purpose CT image localization attenuation correction consider diagnostic quality CT . Following completion CT , [ 11C ] Acetate administer described Section VI.F.3.b . A dynamic PET image acquire 3D list mode total 30 minute . From list mode data flow image series construct follow : - 12 frame x 10 second ( 2 minute post-injection ) - 6 frame x 30 second - 1 frame x 60 second A second series -reconstructed demonstrate dynamic brain regional metabolism follow : - 12 frame x 10 second ( 2 minute post-injection ) - 8 frame x 30 second ( 2 6 minute ) - 4 frame x 60 second ( 6 10 minute ) - 2 frame 300 second ( 10 20 minute ) - 1 frame 600 second ( 20 30 minute ) Reconstructions perform 128 x 128 image matrix use 3D OSEM ( 4 iteration , 21 subset ) 3 mm Gaussian filter . 3 . Study Procedures Schedule Events : 1 . Initial visit prior [ 11C ] Acetate PET/CT : Patients identify potential candidate study approach explain study obtain write informed consent enrol protocol . The following additional patient data obtain : histologic diagnosis ( surgical procedure carry ) , IDH mutational status , age radiologic diagnosis , weight , full medical neurological history physical exam . Correlative imaging perform use MR brain , without gadolinium , within 14 day prior enrollment . In addition , available , 2-hydroxyglutarate ( 2HG ) MR spectroscopy available review determination 2HG concentration . For patient refer outside UTSW Parkland hospital , patient record image review determine eligibility study obtain baseline comparative imaging scan . 2 . Day baseline follow [ 11C ] Acetate scan : [ 11C ] Acetate PET/CT scan perform baseline time clinical follow ; 3 month grade 2 glioma patient standard follow , 2-3 month treatment patient image pre- post-treatment . The patient position supine PET/CT scanner dynamic scan brain . Patients two intravenous line place , one arm . [ 11C ] Acetate PET/CT perform use standard dose 0.3 mCi/kg maximum 30mCi [ 11C ] Acetate . A single imaging field brain image dynamically 30 min follow start 1-min intravenous infusion [ 11C ] Acetate , describe Section VI.F.2 . 4 . General Concomitant Medication Supportive Care Guidelines Any adverse effect , relate non-related injection [ 11C ] Acetate , treat clinically indicate study-related restriction . 5 . Duration Therapy Follow-up : This observational study patient remain study duration clinical follow , determine treat physician . [ 11C ] Acetate PET scan timing determine base individual clinical course .</detailed_description>
