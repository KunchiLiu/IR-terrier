	<brief_summary>There implant removal device market manufacturer . New feature describe comparison exist removal technique . Overall , RemovAid™ combine feature fixation , incision extraction . This combination function previously combine single device . The investigator wish perform pilot clinical investigation aim demonstrate Investigational Medical Device ( IMD ) , RemovAid ™ , may safely effectively facilitate implant removal . Other aim show IMD potential reduce procedure length variability , reduce procedural complexity reduce need additional procedural equipment relate CI removal procedure , without cause harm subject .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Removal Palpable Subdermal Contraceptive Rod Implants .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Contraceptive Implants ( CIs ) introduce commercial market early 1980s . They advocate safe effective method contraception , include WHO 's Essential Medicines list . CI manufacturer focus intense effort make insertion CIs easy , largely leave CI removal untouched mercy various service provider . Different introducers trocars available use different CI system available internationally , second generation , single-use trocar supply Nexplanon® implant system available Sweden . This second generation trocar reduce number misplace deeply inserted CIs , underlines benefit standardize minor surgical procedure use dedicate medical device . The CI removal procedure recommendation remain essentially unchanged 40 year , rely scalpel , forceps general surgical skill service provider . Currently , standardize technique removal CIs exist , dedicate CI removal device find commercial market . Removal palpable subdermal implant generally simple , minor surgical office procedure . However , procedure implant removal require train skill procedure insertion . There risk slippage scalpel blade sudden movement client cause inadvertent deep penetration , case underlying structure could affect . Mean removal time , time incision removal rod , consistently report less four minute , however range 0.2 - 60 minute . Available research show procedure length current CI removal procedure highly variable reliant individual operator skill .</detailed_description>
