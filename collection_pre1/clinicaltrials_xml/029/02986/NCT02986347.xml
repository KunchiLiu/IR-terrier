	<brief_summary>The anesthetic technique choice surgical treatment CTS vary among surgeon . In last decade study describe performance surgery use local anesthesia adrenaline without necessity sedation use pneumatic garrote , good effectiveness substantial reduction cost . However need study appropriate design methodology evaluate actual effectiveness kind anesthesia surgical treatment CTS . Objective : To evaluate effectiveness cost open surgery CTS randomize trial compare two anesthesia method : intravenous regional anesthesia ( Bier ) local anesthesia adrenaline without limb garroting ( Lalondi ) . Methods : This study develop Group Hand Surgery Upper Limb ; Department Orthopedics Traumatology , Federal University São Paulo , UNIFESP / EPM co-participation Hand Surgery Microsurgery Department Hospital Alvorada . This study Randomized Clinical Trial . The previous calculation sample result 77 patient . The following primary outcome assess : Pain visual analogue scale ( VAS ) . Costs : Costs related anesthetic surgical procedure record . The secondary outcome : Use Analgesics , Anxiety Depression HADS ( Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale ) scale . Quality life Boston Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Questionnaire ( BCTQ ) . Remission paresthesia surgical intervention , complication failure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Surgical treatment CTS often perform hospital condition , use anesthesia . The anesthetic technique choice varies among surgeon . In last decade study describe performance surgery use local anesthesia adrenaline without necessity sedation use pneumatic garrote , good effectiveness substantial reduction cost procedure anesthetic method . However , evaluate level strength evidence study , notice need study appropriate design methodology evaluate actual effectiveness kind anesthesia surgical treatment CTS . Objective : To evaluate effectiveness cost open surgery CTS randomize trial compare two anesthesia method : intravenous regional anesthesia ( Bier ) local anesthesia adrenaline without limb garroting ( Lalondi ) . Methods : This study develop Group Hand Surgery Upper Limb ; Department Orthopedics Traumatology , Federal University São Paulo , UNIFESP / EPM co-participation Hand Surgery Microsurgery Department Medical Residency Service Hand Surgery Hospital Alvorada . This study Randomized Clinical Trial . The previous calculation sample result need total inclusion 35 patient group , total 70 patient , consider loss 10 % follow-up include 77 patient . The following primary outcome assess : Pain visual analogue scale ( VAS ) , , measure pre-operative , transoperatory , immediate postoperative , 2 hour , 4 hour , 6 hour , 8 hour , 12 hour surgery . Costs : Costs related anesthetic surgical procedure record . The secondary outcome : Use Analgesics , Anxiety Depression HADS ( Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale ) scale . Quality life Boston Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Questionnaire ( BCTQ ) . Remission paresthesia surgical intervention , complication failure .</detailed_description>
