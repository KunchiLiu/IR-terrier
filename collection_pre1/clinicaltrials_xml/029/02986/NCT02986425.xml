	<detailed_description>Background : Drug-related morbidity mortality increase problem European healthcare system . Multimorbidity , polypharmacy old age important risk factor drug-related hospital admission ( DRA ) . The reported incidence DRAs elderly may high 30 % acute case , half DRAs likely preventable . They mainly relate prescribe problem non-compliance drug regimen . A significant proportion healthcare cost spent unnecessary intervention inappropriate medication . The Systematic Tool Reduce Inappropriate Prescribing ( STRIP ) structure method perform medication review optimise pharmacotherapy . Design : European multi-centre , cluster randomise , control trial people age 70 year old , multimorbidity polypharmacy , ambulatory visit hospital stay one four participate centre Ireland , Belgium , Switzerland Netherlands . A cluster define around treat physician , i.e . treat physician randomise defines allocation patient . Clusters patient randomise intervention arm receiving STRIP optimise therapy control arm undergo usual clinical care . The patient physician allocate intervention group undergo systematic drug review pharmacotherapy optimisation physician pharmacist use STRIP , include STRIPA software . That provide research team recommendation change patient 's medication . Based STRIPA recommendation agreement change patient ' pharmacotherapy team research physician pharmacist prescribe physician , patient receive structure counsel his/her medication ; general practitioner receive report . Patients follow 1 year follow-up phone call 2 , 6 12 month . For purpose trial , hospitalisation follow-up participant adjudicate ass relationship adverse drug event . Objectives : The primary objective ass effect structure medication review pharmacotherapy optimisation use STRIP drug-related hospitalisation ( DRA ) cause over- , mis- , underuse over- , mis- , underprescribing medication . Secondary objective assess impact pharmacotherapy optimisation fall , quality life , polypharmacy , medication change , activity daily live , mortality . Statistical consideration : 80 cluster cluster size range 12 38 participant include . Therefore , 2000 patient , 1000 patient arm , recruit 18 month . The trial 80 % power sample size . The primary analysis intention-to-treat ( ITT ) analysis , whereby randomised patient include group allocate . The primary outcome drug-related admission analyse use random-effects compete risk proportional hazard model account compete risk death cluster data within centre prescribe physician . Overall survival analyse use random-effects Cox proportional hazard model account cluster data within centre prescribe physician . The analysis fall also take account compete risk death . Continuous outcome analyse random-effects linear regression . All effect measure accompany 95 % confidence interval p-values two-sided .</detailed_description>
