	<brief_summary>Pulmonary embolism ( PE ) remain diagnostic challenge . False negative testing expose patient risk potentially fatal recurrence . False positive testing expose patient potentially fatal unduly side effect anticoagulant . Current diagnostic strategy rely sequential use pretest clinical probability , Ddimer test , chest imaging . Two chest image modality validate PE diagnostic exclusion : Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography ( CTPA ) planar V/Q scan . Main limitation planar V/Q high proportion non-conclusive result , therefore require additional testing complex diagnostic algorithm . Main limitation CTPA high radiation dose contraindication ( renal failure ) . In randomized trial compare strategy base CTPA planar V/Q scan , 30 % increase rate PE diagnose find arm use CTPA , raise hypothesis over-diagnosing over-treating PE use CTPA . V/Q Single Photon Emission CT ( SPECT ) new method scintigraphic acquisition report improve diagnostic performance test , could reduce number non-conclusive test allow simplify diagnostic algorithm . The investigator hypothesize strategy base V/Q SPECT could alternative two usual approach respond rightly two main issue combine advantage CTPA ( simplify diagnostic approach ) planar V/Q ( overdiagnosis , low radiation exposure , contraindication ) . Although recent survey show 70 % nuclear medicine center perform SPECT rather planar image diagnose PE , diagnostic management outcome study , diagnostic decision would make basis standardize algorithm base V/Q SPECT lack . Such study need conduct ensure safety diagnostic exclusion use V/Q SPECT base strategy non-inferior previously validate strategy , verify use V/Q SPECT lead over-diagnosis .</brief_summary>
