	<detailed_description>Visual impairment one ten prevalent disability pose extraordinary challenge individual society , heavily dependent sight . Drug development genetic engineering marginal success possible treatment new hope generate recent advance neuroscience , micro-fabrication technology , biomaterials , neuromorphic engineering information communication technology lead development highly sophisticated neural prosthetic device interact nervous system . Such assistive device already allow thousand deaf patient hear sound acquire language ability hope exist field visual rehabilitation . Several research group worldwide engage attempt restore vision retinal prosthesis . However device viable cause blindness . Thus , communication link eye brain destroyed ( e.g . Glaucoma optic nerve atrophy ) , case 148 million people worldwide , visual cortical prosthesis hold dominant hope visual restoration . Consequently , many compel reason pursue development cortical prosthesis capable restore useful vision profoundly blind patient approach may treatment available end-stage retinitis pigmentosa patient pathology glaucoma optic atrophy , trauma retina and/or optic nerve , diseases central visual pathway due brain injury stroke . The investigator implant CORTIVIS vision neuroprosthetic system , utilizes FDA clear microelectrode array , blind human volunteer obtain descriptive feedback visualize percept . The experiment design learn volunteer learn integrate electrical stimulation brain visual area meaningful percept . It expect cortical device create truly meaningful visual percept translate functional gain recognition , localization grasp object skillful navigation familiar unfamiliar environment result substantial improvement standard live blind visually impaired person . All experiment carry patient 's hospital room ( Hospital IMED Elche ) post-surgical period human psychophysical laboratory ( University Miguel Hern√°ndez ) .</detailed_description>
