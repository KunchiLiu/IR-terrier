	<brief_title>Research Pathophysiology Treatment Depression Using Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor Amyloid Neuroimaging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recently investigator report association childhood trauma refractory depression , related Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor ( BDNF ) . Even though level peripheral BDNF closely related depression treatment , investigator still little idea role BDNF . In research , investigator go find genetic variation affect treatment response process , figure specific role BDNF depressive patient correlate Neuroimaging . Along BDNF , many kind proinflammatory cytokine show increased amount related depressive patient . Leptin , adiponectin , plasma tryptohphan also see relate response depression . Here , investigator try see specific difference neuroimaging show depressive patient relate peripheral marker . The investigator evaluate 36 depressive patient compare 24 normal control . For depressive patient , exclude bipolar spectrum disorder , psychotic disorder , neurocognitive disorder , subject organic brain lesion , test HAM D score 16 , include research . As psychiatric evaluation , investigator MINI International Psychiatric Interview Plus ( MINI Plus ) , Suicidal ideation evaluation , Hamilton Depression Inventory 17 ( HAM D 17 ) , Hamilton Anxiety Inventory ( HAM A ) get information clinical severity . As neuroimaging evaluation , investigator magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) diffusion tensor image amyloid Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) see specific deposition . For peripheral marker inflammation neurotrophic factor , investigator platelet BDNF level , pre-inflammatory factor . The investigator also check genotyping BDNF . For follow evaluation , investigator keep psychiatric evaluation HAM D , HAM A peripheral proteinomic evaluation platelet BDNF level , pro-inflammatory cytokine . This research figure correlation neurotrophic factor BDNF , inflammatory factor see peripheral blood assay treatment response depression . Also investigator try integrate peripheral change along BDNF genotyping specific change see neuroimaging . Replicating research high statistical power would promise find 'reliable peripheral marker prognosis depression ' .</detailed_description>
