	<detailed_description>Many hospital readmission could prevent high risk patient identify effective intervention target towards individual . However , exist claims-based predictive model perform poorly provide timely actionable information . In study , researcher prospectively enroll patient data collection design prediction model integrate claim data ( inpatient , outpatient , pharmacy ) , electronic health record data ( clinical , social , behavioral indicator ) , use wearable device smartphones collect patient-generated data ( physical activity sleep pattern ) . Patients randomize use either smartphone wearable activity track device capture patient-generated health data .</detailed_description>
