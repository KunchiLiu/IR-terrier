	<brief_summary>This trial conduct cocktail-study namely open-label , randomize , two-sequence , two-period crossover , cocktail study combination cocktail-drugs use illustrate whether , degree dicloxacillin affect level activity 5 important CYP enzyme therefore play potentially decisive role serious drug-drug interaction .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dicloxacillin : Clinical Relevance Drug-drug Interactions Induction Drug Metabolism .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Given knowledge explain dicloxacillin drug warfarin potential dangerous drug drug interaction effect warfarin downregulated degree might cause patient thrombotic event . A potential explanation namely dicloxacillin increase activity certain drug metabolise enzyme metabolise warfaring turn decrease concentration drug blood therapeutic effect . Cocktail study golden standard investigate whether change P450 enzymes result drug-drug interaction . The cocktail consist Midazolam , omeprazole , tolbutamide , caffein dextromethorphan well know marker enzyme . These marker safe , specific ( enzyme ) metabolism use several study Serious Adverse reaction report . By measure Concentration drug metabolite plasma / Urine treatment dicloxacillin estimate AUC ( area curve ) test hypothesis/primary end point whether change AUC Tolbutamide ( CYP2C9 )</detailed_description>
