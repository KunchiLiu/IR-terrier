	<brief_title>PET Imaging Study Amish Mennonite Patients With CNTNAP2 Mutations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator focus mGluR5 PET binding surrogate measure level activity mTOR kinase pathway . This study conduct New York State Psychiatric Institute ( NYSPI ) take place Columbia University Medical Center ( CUMC ) New York City research office Strasburg , PA . Subjects ( n=20 ) CNTNAP2 mutation schizophrenia relate condition recruit Amish Mennonite community bring CUMC detailed investigation . Affected individual compare Amish Mennonite control subject draw family harbor CNTNAP2 mutation ( n=20 ) . The primary measure consist mGluR PET binding DLPFC . In addition , secondary analysis assess bind brain region hippocampus visual cortex . Exploratory measure , well relationships PET mGluR5 bind clinical symptomatology , assess .</detailed_description>
