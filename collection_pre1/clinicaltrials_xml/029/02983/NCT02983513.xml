	<brief_title>Early Intervention Preterm Infants : Short Long Term Developmental Outcome After Parental Training Program</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Very preterm birth associate motor , cognitive behavioral problem . Micro-structural brain abnormality , even absence focal lesion , document neuroimaging study preterm infant term correct age later childhood . These alteration brain maturation occur neonatal period may implicate long-term neurobehavioral disorder later experience preterm baby . However , increase evidence also negative environmental factor ( intensive care , excessive sensory stimulation , paucity parental contact etc . ) affect later outcomes . Potential benefit early dyadic interaction preterm baby massage reduce effect NICU stressor environment demonstrate . More recently , study investigate visual function preterm infant focus potential role early visual interaction enhance attention improve later neurodevelopment . The role early intervention strategy improve neurodevelopment recently emphasize . Early intervention program base concept `` individualized care '' prove effective promote brain maturation neurodevelopmental outcome . In context , early intervention Mother Infant Transaction Program ( MITP ) Premie Start , target parenting , great potential sustain effect child development . In addition , recent study show exposure stressful event neonatal period cause epigenetic modification child born preterm ; particular alteration serotonergic tone observe , associate methylation serotonin transporter gene , could implicate etiology behavioral disorder observe child . In animal model epigenetic effect appear influence maternal care epigenetically modulate offspring ' stress response .</detailed_description>
