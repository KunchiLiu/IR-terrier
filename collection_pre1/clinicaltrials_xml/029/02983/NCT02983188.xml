	<brief_summary>One double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled trial design examine whether berberine add current antipsychotic drug could produce significantly great efficacy reduce atypical antipsychotic-induced metabolic syndrome . To achieve objective , 120 patient schizophrenia spectrum disorder ( SSD ) develop metabolic syndrome recruit randomly assign receive additional treatment placebo ( n = 60 ) berberine ( n = 60 , 1.2 g/day , 0.4 g , t.i.d . ) 12 week . The primary outcome weight gain ; outcome include body mass index ( BMI ) , waist circumference , blood pressure , triglyceride ( TG ) , total cholesterol , high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) , low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) , fast glucose , insulin , insulin resistant index .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Schizophrenia severe mental illness affect 1 % worldwide population . Most patient develop chronic course frequent relapse exacerbation symptom require long-term treatment . Although antipsychotic therapy mainstay management schizophrenia , treatment outcome often unsatisfactory , largely due adverse drug reaction . Metabolic syndrome highly prevalent side effect incur antipsychotic therapy , prevalence 35 % patient severe mental illness Hong Kong . No effective therapy available treat antipsychotic-induced metabolic syndrome , although antidiabetic medication may limit benefit control weight gain increase glucose level . Berberine natural plant alkaloid isolate Chinese herb , Coptis chinensis ( Huang-Lian ) , traditionally use diarrhea cause bacterial viral infection clinical practice . Several line evidence suggest berberine body weight-lowering , anti-diabetic , anti-hyperlipidemic effect . One recent study show addition berberine significantly prevent olanzapine ( OLZ ) -Induced weight gain rat modulate expression multiple key gene control energy expenditure . In addition peripheral effect , berberine also broadly modulate brain biogenic amine relate receptor involve pathogenesis antipsychotic-induced metabolic syndrome . This suggest may suitable treatment antipsychotic-induced metabolic disturbance . Over past decade , number study demonstrate comparable efficacy berberine mono- combination therapy reduce metabolic symptom , without serious side effect . The efficacy berberine also well confirm patient gastrointestinal , liver , heart , ovary disease well renal-transplant recipient healthy volunteer . It well tolerate minor digestive reaction observe , mainly nausea , diarrhea , constipation , abdominal distension pain . The result obtain clinical animal study group strongly suggest promise effect berberine OLZ-induced weight gain , without change pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamics profile OLZ peripheral central level . This warrant evaluation large randomize control trial . The work hypothesis propose study berberine adjuvant control weight gain metabolic symptom associate antipsychotic therapy . To test hypothesis , 12-week , double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled trial conduct patient schizophrenia spectrum disorder ( SSD ) determine whether berberine adjunctive treatment could limit weight gain improve anthropometric metabolic measure patient SSD develop metabolic syndrome .</detailed_description>
