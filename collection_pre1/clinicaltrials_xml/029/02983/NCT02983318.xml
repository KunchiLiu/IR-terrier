	<brief_summary>In number neuropsychiatric disorder depression , brain inflammation glutamate mediate excitotoxicity ( cell death over-activated stimulation ) suspect play key role . It difficult , impossible , determine potential destructiveness inflammatory response see disease state study brain 's inflammatory cell ( microglia ) activity isolation . The investigator propose develop mean concurrently study inflammatory response ( i.e. , microglial activity ) potentially devastate consequence ( i.e. , glutamate excitotoxicity ) across entire brain order establish importance inflammation . In study investigator propose phased clinical study whereby early-phase involves development capacity study inflammation-mediated damage brain cell , follow feasibility study patient clinical depression test whether concurrent inflammation glutamate excess could measure key brain region associate depressed mood state .</brief_summary>
