	<detailed_description>PROJECT DESCRIPTION Aim The aim iKT study develop test multifaceted implementation intervention feasibility , acceptability effectiveness.The intervention tailor fit inner context operating department , promote anaesthetic provider use aseptic technique . Theory In design present study , investigator follow four iterative phase identify UK Medical Research Council ( MRC ) framework develop evaluate complex intervention ( 1 ) : *Review theoretical basis innovation context *Conducting pre study design intervention , *The exploratory trial i.e . intervention implementation evaluation . The aim leadership intervention support leader develop participatory effective leadership behaviour promote OR team 's use aseptic technique facilitate inter professional learning . The middle front-line leader study OR participate intervention base iKT model inspire person-centeredness ( 2 ) social construction complexity thinking ( 3 ) . The care professional participate study consider active partner co-creators implementation process activity . This type collaborative approach mean researcher , leader OR team work closely together throughout research process order produce finding relevant user context ( 4 ) . Using innovative approach represent major departure concept 'compliance ' shift towards change result participatory mindful process ( 5 ) . In inter-professional dialogue , follow principle underpin process : - All partner expert various professional experience , - Power differential among partner acknowledge sensitively address , - All partner discuss potential benefit harm innovation , research implementation strategy , - The process capacity-building everyone encompass opportunity mutual learning ( 4 ) . DESIGN This mixed method prospective control implementation study embed process evaluation . Two similar size surgical department include ; one select experimental department , control . In addition standard education HH experimental ward participate iKT intervention Participants 1 . Leaders staff two orthopaedic OR department within two similar size university hospital western region Sweden Sk√•ne invite take part study . Each OR performs approximately 800-900 trauma induce acute hip surgery annually . One select study department one control ; approximately 135 person employ department . Of , 75 % anaesthetic provider ( physician , nurse nurse assistant ) . Both experimental control OR receive hospital 's standard strategy infection control : audit feedback , reminder computerise education hand hygiene lecture Infection Control give expert area . 2 . 1500 patient undergoing fracture surgery hip invite site take part registry study post-operative complication satisfaction care give . THE INTERVENTION Components intervention include : - Two workshop , consist educational session cover state art regard person-centeredness , prevention infection , leadership , implementation . The educational component result pre-studies work framework dialogues front-line leader research group . In dialogues participant give opportunity reflect barrier enablers change ; - The participant support create action plan aim facilitating anaesthesia provider ' change practice `` 1 ) support , visibility communication ; ( 2 ) create positive milieu vision , role modelling change ; ( 3 ) influence organisational structure process resource , policy monitoring '' ( 6 ) . The action plan execute 6 month include 6-8 learning laboratory , lead clinical leader facilitate researcher . OUTCOME Primary outcome : Process evaluation : Assessing , dose , reach fidelity , acceptability , feasibility unforeseen consequence implementation strategy Secondary outcome : ) The application hand hygiene aseptic technique invasive procedure b ) Complications hip surgery DATA COLLECTION Process evaluation : A key element project process evaluation assess acceptability , feasibility unforeseen consequence implementation interview ethnographic fieldwork . Ethnographic fieldwork ( 7 ) particularly suit understanding culture complexity find explanation specific intervention strategy fail succeed . Participant observation ( 8 ) make throughout implementation process . The purpose use method capture talk event relation implementation strategy understand basic assumption regard team-work patient safety strategy OR . Attention pay practice may work barrier , enablers change . In addition , purposively select key staff informal leader professional category ( ensure maximum variation ) ask interview give perspective implementation strategy activity . The interview audio-taped transcribed verbatim . In addition ethnographic method , structure observation use determine `` dose '' intervention component give receive , well fidelity intervention ( 9 ) . The use hand hygiene/aseptic technique : The direct observation hand hygiene regard gold standard use study ( 10 ) . Adherence hand hygiene guideline aseptic technique measure use pre-tested modify version World Health Organisation 's observational tool ( 11 ) . The form modify match OR context ( 12 ) . An opportunity hand hygiene define situation require hand disinfection accordance national local guideline ( 13 ) . A hand hygiene application define use alcohol-based hand rub relation opportunity . The amount product use duration application record . Adherence record relation professional category type indication . Based power estimation 90 % power alpha level 5 % estimate difference intervention 10 % study sit time period , 100 care procedure require HH AT observe time point department Pre-intervention data collect experimental control ward close connection intervention . Post-intervention data collect 6 12 month complete leadership intervention . Postoperative complication : The nurse responsible discharge , informed consent collect information , patient ' medical chart post-operative urinary- respiratory tract infection , bloodstream surgical wound infection , pressure-ulcers confusion . A research assistant perform chard audit every 20th include patient validate data . Six week 12 month discharge patient send regular mail survey patient satisfaction treatment antibiotic wound infection . Data analysis Interviews field note : Inductive content analysis use analysis qualitative data derive interview participant observation . The texts read re-read obtain full understand gain sense whole . Meaning unit extract , condense , label code , aim study keep mind . The code assign reflected meaning unit serve tool view data new way . The code compare group sub-themes . This analysis continue interpret underlie mean relation time context support theoretical framework . Observational registry data : The type statistic use data analysis drive level data distribution . Descriptive statistic use summarize data AT inferential statistic use comparison group time period . Ethics The study conduct approval Regional Ethics Review Board Gothenburg , Sweden . Informed consent obtain ward manager prior observation . The project conduct line four principal requirement Helsinki Declaration ; autonomy , non-malfeasance , beneficence , justice ( 54 ) . Both oral write information give participant write consent sought ( appendix 4:1-3 ) . In case potential participate patient suffer condition impede possibility give informed consent , next kin ask consider give consent participation . All data analyze report group lever . The participant 's confidentiality privacy maintain .</detailed_description>
