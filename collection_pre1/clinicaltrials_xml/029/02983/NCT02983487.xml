	<brief_summary>Due wan infectious well vaccine immunity lack vaccination booster , large number adolescent adults longer immunized Bordetella pertussis , agent whooping cough consequently may contract whoop cough . Furthermore , population represent reservoir infectious agent dissemination non-immune infant possible , cause severe illness , even death , age group . Few study carry whooping cough developing country ( incidence , contaminator 's age , etc . ) , specifically , none assess duration protection induce whole cell pertussis ( wP ) vaccine mainly presently used country . However , data duration vaccine induce protection essential determine ) usefulness vaccine booster ii ) target age group booster . The aims present study : - To evaluate proportion confirm pertussis case infant present whooping cough syndrome ( WP1a ) - To evaluate proportion confirm pertussis case healthy carrier among contact case - To determine origin infant 's contamination ( WP1b ) - To determine duration protection induce wP vaccine use contact case child population age 3 15 yo ( WP1b WP2 ) - To bring new scientific evidence document potential need initiate booster ( WP1b WP2 ) - To allow comparison result obtain use methodology acellular pertussis vaccine and/or context . Potential implication use pertussis vaccine low moderate income country . - To increase local capability transfer material expertise make diagnosis pertussis possible centre reference strengthen pertussis monitoring network implicated country . - To improve child 's health well match vaccination schedule accord reality situation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Vaccination infant young child whole-cell pertussis ( wP ) vaccine dramatically decrease mortality morbidity due B. pertussis . However , twenty-five year `` honeymoon '' period , introduction high vaccination coverage , reappearance whooping cough case industrialized country observe infant contaminated adolescent adult . This modification transmission disease introduction wP vaccine indicate immunity provide vaccine lifelong , like provide natural infection , decreases7-9 year first vaccination first booster . Due secondary effect , wP vaccine use booster . Moreover , wP vaccine show different term efficacy ( vary 30 95 % ) . Acellular pertussis ( aP ) vaccine consist purify inactivated bacterial protein , therefore develop commercialize . These vaccine induce much few side effect may therefore use primary-vaccination well vaccine booster . They expensive reproducible manufacturing . The humoral long-term cell-mediated immunity grant aP vaccine show comparable immunity grant wP vaccine , effective 6-7 year booster vaccine second year life , also induce different cell immunity . Since 2007 , proportion B. pertussis B. parapertussis isolates longer produce vaccine antigen ( ) increase industrialized country use aP vaccine . These isolates may decrease efficacy aP vaccine . Does type isolates circulate Low income country still use wP vaccine ? Does reduce efficacy wP vaccine ? Moreover , wP vaccine use Southern country assess like one use Northern country . In particular , duration protection primary-vaccination vaccine booster know . Rational : For various reason , large difference exit monitor system across world : awareness disease variable depend population ; difference immunization coverage strategy ; diverse composition vaccine use ; overall large difference vaccine term immunity disease , protection infection and/or decrease transmission pathogen . The underestimation pertussis recognize World Health Organisation ( WHO ) ( Global Pertussis Initiative ) highlight problem reliability declare data . This situation result ) limit use biological diagnostics ( problem isolate bacteria laboratory ) ; ii ) diagnostic error due fact diagnosis mainly clinical ; iii ) inadequate monitoring illness ; iv ) lack awareness among physician . Pertussis consider come identify respiratory pathogen : clinician continue consider child illness ignore adult infection . The absence available tool allow reliable diagnostic make make difficult assess real impact pathogen child respiratory syndrome . Several study perform duration protection induce wP aP vaccine Australia , USA Europe . However , study perform wP vaccine use middle low income country none Cambodia , Madagascar Togo . This one objectives study . This allow vaccination strategy region concern adapt need , recommend WHO . Expected Outcomes : Impact vaccination strategy : This study , well analysis data national program surveillance Pertussis , may raise public health authority ' awareness help adapt assessment method national vaccination program include duration protection induce national wP vaccine data vaccine coverage , basis information vaccination booklet , recommend WHO . Impact improvement child 's health : The result study raise public health authority ' awareness vaccine-preventable disease , especially whooping cough . This raise awareness focus surveillance/monitoring diagnosis disease . Moreover , development reliable biological diagnostic tool pertussis help clinician confirm pertussis diagnosis adapt therapeutic approach accordingly , thus improve care infect person stop transmission disease contagious . Impact surveillance disease develop hospital-based surveillance , Training , technology transfer strengthen surveillance network : For first time , detection identification technique specie Bordetella genus ( i.e . B. parapertussis B. holmesii ) transfer laboratory low income country . The diagnosis different Bordetella specie real time polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) measure anti-pertussis toxin Immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) level serological test set laboratory participate study . These laboratory could use national surveillance network thus improve quality data available local health authority WHO . Thus , study allow establishment effective monitoring pertussis country participate study raise population 's awareness , train local doctor clinical screen disease , finally via transfer diagnostic technique within laboratory .</detailed_description>
