	<brief_summary>The relevance study determine efficacy two osteopathic technique - Thrust Technique Muscle Energy Technique ( MET ) - improve neuromuscular component trunk clinical symptom adult worker Chronic Low Back Pain ( CLBP ) . Few study investigate compare physiological response technique quantitatively , publish study compare effect low back pain subject term symptom , postural balance muscle activation . The main outcome compute electromyography measurement ass trunk neuromuscular activation pattern well force platform parameter determine postural control . Clinical symptom pain intensity , perception disability fear avoidance also compute . This first study compare two osteopathic technique use main biological outcome related trunk neuromuscular function .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose study assess efficacy two osteopathic technique ( Thrust MET ) CLBP adult worker treatment . Thirty male participant chronic low back pain , volunteer , active worker age 35 55 year ( age process ) recruit convenience community local . All participant sign inform consent form approve North Parana University Ethics Committee Research Human Subjects . The intervention follow CONSORT recommendation randomize controlled trial . All baseline test evaluation perform blinded evaluator study intervention . The sample randomized two group : Group # 1 ( n=15 ) , receive Thrust technique apply level dysfunction ; Group # 2 ( n=15 ) , receive Muscle Energy Technique , also apply level dysfunction . The allocation print card sequentially number opaque envelope . The treatment ( intervention ) occur 2 phase 3 week one . The participant receive one technique phase , one rest week ( washout ) receive technique ( crossover ) , total 7 week . In study , technique apply lumbar vertebral level present dysfunction diagnose specific evaluation , perform two specialized physiotherapist osteopathy . Before manipulation ( Thrust MET ) participant evaluate 2 task - bipedal without load bipedal load ( 10 % body mass ) - force platform . Parallel task , record measurement EMG surface compute determine pattern trunk neuromuscular activation amplitude RMS signal well muscle fatigue median frequency parameter . Before perform task force platform , maximum voluntary isometric contraction perform back ( paravertebral ) abdominal ( rectus ) muscle order normalize signal EMG determine level muscular activity task ( without load ) . After intervention , immediate final revaluation include use measure initial evaluation , muscle activation trunk ( EMG ) , balance ( force platform ) , clinical symptom pain ( Visual Analogue Scale McGill Short Questionnaire ) , psychosomatic factor ( Fear Avoidance Believe Questionnaire ) disability ( Roland Morris Questionnaire ) . For analysis two-way ANOVA use dependent variable compare two group ( G1 versus G2 ) situation ( pre post-immediate , 15 day ) clinical measurement , postural balance EMG . The size effect also compute determine rate change observe .</detailed_description>
