	<brief_summary>The purpose research study well understand sex hormone therapy use treat woman menopausal symptom , men low testosterone , hormone therapy transgender woman , affect class medication call NRTIs ( nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ) use treat prevent HIV infection . The two commonly use NRTIs tenofovir emtricitabine , component drug Truvada also include combination product Atripla , Complera , Stribild . The medication 's ability work effectively may alter someone also take sex hormone therapy . In order determine effect , sample collect part body HIV make copy . These sample measure level HIV medication , HIV virus sex hormone present . The sample look study include blood , cell vagina , semen , tissue biopsy female genital tract rectum .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Design : This observational study tenofovir/emtricitabine ( TFV/FTC ) concentration genital low gastrointestinal tract . Participants select basis receive TFV/FTC part ongoing HIV care . After participant education , informed consent , screen study eligibility , participant evaluate baseline . All sample collect course outpatient sample visit . Study Sampling : 1 . A blood sample collect measure concentration TFV/FTC blood plasma , concentration TFV/FTC active metabolite concentration ( TFVdp/FTCtp ) PBMCs , concentration sex hormone blood stream . 2 . Vaginal cervical tissue collect ( cisgender woman ) measure concentration TFVdp/FTCtp , HIV RNA , estrogen/progesterone . 3 . Rectal tissue sample collect measure concentration TFVdp/FTCtp , HIV RNA , estrogen/progesterone ( cisgender transgender woman ) , testosterone ( cisgender men ) . 4 . A semen sample collect ( cisgender men ) measure concentration TFV/FTC , HIV RNA testosterone . Pharmacokinetic Analysis : All blood , cervical , vaginal , semen rectal tissue sample analyze Clinical Pharmacology Analytical Chemistry Laboratory ( CPAC ) UNC School Pharmacy . TFV/FTC measure blood seminal plasma TFVdp/FTCtp measure PBMCs , SMCs use validated LC-MS/MS method . HIV RNA measure blood seminal plasma use Abbott Real Time HIV-1 quantitative assay . HIV RNA within cervical seminal cell rectal tissue measure use establish Droplet Digital PCR method . Estradiol progesterone measure serum use validated florescent immunoassay .</detailed_description>
