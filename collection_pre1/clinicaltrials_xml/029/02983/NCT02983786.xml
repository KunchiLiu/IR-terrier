	<brief_summary>The goal project evaluate noninvasive monitor brain metabolism blood flow critically ill human . If validate , reliable noninvasive brain blood flow metabolism monitor , allow physiologic pharmacologic decision base real-time brain physiology , potentially become important tool clinician effort prevent additional brain tissue death patient admit stroke , brain hemorrhage traumatic brain injury .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Detection Cerebral Ischemia With Noninvasive Neurometabolic Optical Monitor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many critically ill patient admit hospital infarcted brain tissue yet , period extremely intense expensive critical care , patient discharge new hospital-acquired dead brain tissue , associate life-long disability brain death . This situation arise critical barrier straightforward bedside method monitor cerebral blood flow ( CBF ) adequacy progression post-insult secondary brain damage . This important expectation decrement CBF dangerous excess decrement cerebral metabolic rate oxygen ( CMRO2 ) , detect early , treat avert brain infarction . Clinical example issue , among many others , include post ischemic stroke edema , post thrombolysis hyperemia occlusion , post SAH vasospasm , hyperemic oligemic intracranial hypertension traumatic brain injury stroke , ICH associate global ischemia , intra post carotid endarterectomy oligemia hyperperfusion . Critical care physician need bedside monitor CBF couple CMRO2 . The CMRO2 data allow delineation adequacy CBF occasionally CBF decrement simply match change CMRO2 . The lack monitoring capability result clinician make often helpful therapeutic decision direct non-neurologic endpoint , e.g. , blood pressure ( 7 ) , PaCO2 ( 108 ) , `` hop '' intervention desire effect brain perfusion metabolism . Diffuse Correlation Spectroscopy ( DCS ) Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy ( DOS ) promise NNOM optical technique development UPenn ( Yodh et.al ; 4 US patent ) provide continuous bedside quantitative CBF , CMRO2 oxygen extraction fraction ( OEF ) information . Determination capability detect anaerobic condition , investigator propose , make feasible notion individualize CBF , CMRO2 , OEF measurement brain-directed therapeutic optimization bedside caregiver . This eventually support significant change way Neurocritical Care practice , titrate therapy neurophysiologic rather cardiovascular/ pulmonary endpoint . UPenn research technique presently provide information relative quantitative change CBF CMRO2 baseline . The investigator propose also develop method measurement absolute CBF CMRO2 validate absolute CBF invasive thermodilution ( ThD ) CBF technique . The investigator ' long range goal overall objective prevent in-hospital brain tissue death development improve bedside CBF/ CMRO2/OEF ( NNOM ) monitoring technique .</detailed_description>
