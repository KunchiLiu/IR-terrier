	<brief_summary>Chronic abdominal pelvic pain common complaint follow peritoneal surgery , affect 20-40 % patient . Adhesions account 60 % chronic postoperative pain case , suggest adhesiolysis play important role management pain . Despite initial promising result regard effect adhesiolysis post-operative pain , implementation procedure challenge . The major problem associate adhesiolysis pain recurrence pain , need invasive diagnosis high rate 'negative ' laparoscopy , inadvertent bowel injury surgery . However , diagnosis treatment adhesion may improve use novel cine-MRI technique , application anti-adhesion barrier follow adhesiolysis . In study investigator evaluate new practice-based approach problem chronic post-operative pain cause adhesion . This practice-based approach include use novel imaging technique adhesion ( cine-MRI ) share decision making . Cine-MRI hold promise diagnose map adhesion . Thus patient adhesion , high risk bowel injury , waive surgical treatment . By use anti-adhesion barrier investigator attempt prevent adhesion reformation improve long-term outcome adhesiolysis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Laparoscopic Adhesiolysis Chronic Abdominal Pain Revisited</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Laparoscopic adhesiolysis chronic abdominal pain revisit . Background Prevalence chronic pain follow abdominal surgery may high 40 % . Postoperative chronic pain cause various reason , adhesion identify likely cause 60 % case . Early study adhesiolysis report high success rate , 80 % , patient cause pain . Nonetheless , adhesiolysis seldom use treatment chronic abdominal pain . Controversy laparoscopic adhesiolysis treatment abdominal pain raise landmark trial Swank et al . In trial 100 patient randomized diagnosis adhesion confirm laparoscopy adhesiolysis diagnostic laparoscopy alone . In adhesiolysis group 57 % patient report long-term pain relief vs. 42 % diagnostic group ; difference statistically significant . The author conclude adhesiolysis effective , thereafter many surgeon discard adhesiolysis treatment chronic abdominal pain . However , important critique trial . First , type II error low sample size exclude . Second , experimental study indicate filmy adhesion , may disrupt pneumoperitoneum control patient group , cause pain . Third , adhesion might reform adhesiolysis , diminish long term effect adhesiolysis group . Adhesion formation reformation effectively reduce application anti-adhesion barrier . Apart critique , evidence effective alternative treatment . Patients chronic postoperative pain frequently refer outpatient clinical surgery department RadboudUMC expert opinion . Since 2012 investigator start 'patient participation care ' project patient group , laparoscopic adhesiolysis reintroduce treatment chronic abdominal select case . Cine- MRI use novel non-invasive tool diagnose adhesion , waive need negative laparoscopy patient cause chronic abdominal pain . Cine- MRI recently develop non-invasive diagnostic tool detect symptomatic adhesion , report sensitivity 85 % - 89 % specificity 93 % -95 % . Decision operative treatment make base individualized assessment benefit risk base cine-MRI result shared-decision approach . Further , patient undergoing adhesiolysis treat anti-adhesion barrier . Purpose &amp; Research question The aim study evaluate result novel shared decision approach use cine-MRI cohort patient refer outpatient clinical department surgery chronic postoperative pain . Comparison make patient undergoing laparoscopic adhesiolysis , patient conservatively treated adhesion cine-MRI , patient adhesion cine-MRI . Patients : Patients chronic postoperative pain ( &gt; 6 month ) cause adhesion proven cine-MRI Intervention : Laparoscopic adhesiolysis adhesion barrier Controls : - control group 1 : Patients chronic postoperative pain cine-MRI proven adhesion conservative treatment - Control group 2 patient alternative diagnosis conservative treatment Outcome : • Change symptom ( measured Patients ' Global Impression Change scale ) , current pain ( measure numeric rate scale ) , Healthcare utilization ( hospital visit , paramedic visit , medication ) Plan investigation We perform analysis cohort approximately 100 patient underwent Cine-MRI work-up chronic abdominal pain . Adhesions identify approximately 80 patient , 40 operate underwent laparoscopic adhesiolysis ( group 1 ) . The 40 patient waived operation various reason receive conservative treatment ( group 2 ) . Patients negative cine-MRI analyze group 3 . In case diagnostic laparoscopy perform case history , physical examination cine-MRI inconclusive . These patient analyze part group 1 . Patients ask participate study telephone letter . If agree , questionnaire send compare pain , improvement pain since treatment , use analgesic healthcare utilization operate non-operated group . Further data operation peri-operative complication gather case record . Primary outcome reduction alleviation pain . Secondary outcome current pain score ( measure VAS ) , analgesic use healthcare utilization . Additional secondary outcome operatively treat group incidence conversion open surgery , peri-operative complication . Patients admit outpatient clinic department surgery chronic postoperative pain underwent cine-MRI screen eligibility . Inclusion criterion : - Age ≥ 18 year - Pain exist least 6 month postoperatively Exclusion criterion : - Cine-MRI perform chronic pain ( e.g . recurrent pain episode bowel obstruction )</detailed_description>
