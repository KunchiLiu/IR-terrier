	<brief_title>AZD9150 With MEDI4736 Patients With Advanced Pancreatic , Non-Small Lung Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : Every study cycle 28 day . If participant find eligible take part study , participant begin study treatment within 28 day screen test perform . Participant receive AZD9150 vein 1 hour 3 time first dose MEDI4736 ( 7 , 5 , 3 day beforehand ) , Days 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 every cycle . Participant receive MEDI4736 vein 1 hour Day 1 every cycle , 30 minute AZD9150 infusion . Length Treatment : Participant may continue receive study drug long doctor think participant 's best interest . Participant longer able receive study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , participant unable follow study direction . Study Visits : On Day 1 Cycle 1 beyond : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 4 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw check participant 's thyroid function . - If participant become pregnant , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) urine collect pregnancy test . On Days 8 22 Cycles 1 beyond : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw routine test ( Cycle 1 ) . On Day 15 Cycles 1 beyond : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - Urine collect routine test ( Cycle 1 ) . Every 2 month , participant PET/CT scan MRI check status disease . End-of-Treatment Visit : About 30 day participant 's last dose study drug : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 4 tablespoon ) urine collect routine test . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw check participant 's thyroid function . - Participant PET/CT scan MRI check status disease . - If participant become pregnant , urine collect pregnancy test . Follow-Up : About 1-3 month participant 's last dose study drug , participant PET/CT scan MRI check status disease . If participant come MD Anderson participant 's follow-up visit , participant may call every 12 week ask participant . These call last 10 minute . Participation study end follow-up period . Treatment Beyond Progression : If disease appear get bad tumor appear get large , participant may still able receive study drug participant participant 's doctor decide participant 's best interest . The study doctor discus option participant . If participant chooses receive study drug disease get bad , participant sign additional informed consent form . This investigational study . AZD9150 MEDI4736 FDA approve commercially available . They currently use research purpose . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 75 participant take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
