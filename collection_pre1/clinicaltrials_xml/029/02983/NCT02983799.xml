	<brief_title>Olaparib Tablets Treatment Ovarian Cancer Subjects With Different HRD Tumor Status</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase II , open-label , non-randomized , multi-center study assess efficacy safety olaparib tablet 300 mg ( two 150 mg tablet ) give orally twice daily ( bid ) subject platinum-sensitive partially platinum-sensitive , relapsed , high-grade epithelial ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer , receive least 2 prior line platinum-based chemotherapy . The study ass effectiveness olaparib tablet measure objective response rate ( ORR ) determine Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) v1.1 , subject germline BRCA mutation ( gBRCAm ) , somatic BRCA mutation ( sBRCAm ) , potential aberration homologous recombination deficiency ( HRD ) determine myChoice® HRD , well subject without identifiable HRD . This study utilize Myriad BRACAnalysis CDx® germline BRCA analysis tumor test ( myChoice® HRD ) tumor BRCA analysis HRD status . Four cohort identify base upon genetic test described : - Cohort 1 : gBRCAm , - Cohort 2 : sBRCAm germline BRCA wild type , - Cohort 3 : myChoice® HRD positive ( genomic instability positive ) BRCA wild type ( BRCAwt ) ( BRCA mutation ) , - Cohort 4 : myChoice® HRD negative ( genomic instability negative ) BRCAwt ( BRCA mutation ) .</detailed_description>
