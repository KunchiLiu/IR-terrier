	<brief_summary>Patient delay seek medical attendance symptom acute ST elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) major obstacle reduce current mortality acute coronary syndrome . The Mini RELF device hand hold self applicable device intend detect individual basis elevation ST segment indicative acute coronary occlusion . The investigator aim evaluate accuracy Mini RELF device self-applied daily basis patient coronary artery disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The increase availability small hand hold medical device novel opportunity develop tool guide patient decision-taking process seek medical attendance symptom suggestive acute myocardial infarction . The cornerstone early diagnosis , risk stratification treatment presence ST segment elevation symptom suggestive STEMI . Therefore , hand hold medical device detect ST segment elevation high sensitivity specificity could breakthrough reduction fatality acute myocardial infarction . A number condition tool must fulfil allow save use low threshold general population . Most important accuracy detect new ST segment elevation relate acute artery occlusion . For 30 year 12-lead ECG gold standard detection ST elevation . However , acute coronary occlusion posterior lateral segment always detect gold standard . Moreover , early phase acute coronary occlusion , accuracy 12 lead ECG inadequate . In previous study `` Diagnostic accuracy novel method detection acute transmural myocardial ischemia base upon self-applicable 3-lead configuration '' investigator develop validated sensitive specific 3-lead ECG method ( RELF method ) . The method include new lead configuration new algorithm analyze ECG recording base intra-individual comparison ST level . In summary , 3-lead record healthy subject patient acute coronary occlusion compare automatically one previous reference recording individual . The individualized ST shift use decision variable detect reject acute coronary artery occlusion . The RELF method accurate simultaneously apply 12-lead ECG low sensitivity specificity . In study recording perform sophisticated ECG recording system . The RELF method design applicable also small hand hold ECG device self-applicable Mini RELF device . In current study investigator aim evaluate accuracy Mini RELF device relative 12 lead ECG device self-applied daily basis patient coronary artery disease . In parallel study ( RELF IIb ) investigator aim evaluate specificity RELF method self-applied healthy subject representative future user device .</detailed_description>
