	<brief_title>A Dose Escalation Cohort Expansion Study CD122-Biased Cytokine ( NKTR-214 ) Combination With Anti-PD-1 Antibody ( Nivolumab ) Patients With Select Advanced Metastatic Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>NKTR-214 cytokine ( investigational agent ) design target CD122 , protein find certain immune cell ( know CD8+ T Cells Natural Killer Cells ) expand cell promote anti-tumor effect . Nivolumab full human monoclonal antibody bind molecule call PD-1 immune cell promote anti-tumor effect . Approximately 40 eligible patient enroll dose escalation portion study ( Phase 1 ) assign one five dose regimen NKTR-214 combination nivolumab ( 0.006 mg/kg NKTR-214 every 21 day 240 mg nivolumab every 14 day , 0.003 mg/kg NKTR-214 every 14 day 240 mg nivolumab every 14 day , 0.006 mg/kg NKTR-214 every 14 day 240 mg nivolumab every 14 day , 0.006 mg/kg NKTR-214 every 21 day 360 mg nivolumab every 21 day , 0.003 mg/kg NKTR-214 every 21 day 360 mg nivolumab every 21 day ) . Based safety , tolerability efficacy observe trial , enrollment additional dose escalation cohort plan . The first phase study test safety efficacy profile combination determine dose study Phase 2 overall study . During Phase 2 , cohort patient specific cancer expand patient receive recommend Phase 2 dose schedule NKTR-214 combination nivolumab . All patient enrol study closely monitor determine response treatment well side effect may occur . The efficacy combination assess use objective response rate ( ORR ) . Exploratory immunological biomarkers plasma tumor sample evaluate immune activation .</detailed_description>
