	<brief_summary>80 patient eligible total hip replacement ( THR ) mainly due primary osteoarthritis recruit wait list . The patient randomize either CFP Corail stem , group receive Delta cup Lima . Randomisation do use envelope . Patients could participate one hip . We evaluate patient different questionnaire , radiograph RSA analysis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Controlled Study Comparing CFP Corail Stem</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The concept femoral neck preserve hip replacement intend young active patient . By preserve proximal bone load , transmission proximal femur suppose improve future revision surgery would facilitate . We speculate conservative resection femoral neck could lead good clinical outcome compare conventional stem . We therefore decide compare clinical outcome fixation short stem stem classic , conventional design . 83 patient include randomize control trial patient either receive Collum Femoris Preserving ( CFP ) stem Corail hip stem . Clinical outcome assess , plain radiographs study early migration measure use radiostereometric analysis . All patient go 1 year follow-up . We wait 2 year data conduct final analysis present result .</detailed_description>
