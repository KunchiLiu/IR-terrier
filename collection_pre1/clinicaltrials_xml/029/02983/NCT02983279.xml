	<brief_title>Caloric Restriction Before Surgery Treating Patients With Endometrial , Prostate , Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : 1 ) Investigate caloric restriction change serum micro ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) 21 ( miR-21 ) expression patient prostate , endometrial breast cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : 1 . Investigate measurable change induce caloric restriction patient ( host ) tumor characteristic caloric restriction . 2. . Vital sign include temperature , blood pressure , heart rate respiratory rate monitor baseline , midway , conclusion diet . 3 . Investigate adherence patient diet . 4 . Weight , vital sign , body composition obtain baseline , midway diet , conclusion diet . 5 . Patients psycho-social evaluation use Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy-Prostate ( FACT-P ) test ( prostate cancer ) , FACT-Breast ( B ) test ( breast cancer ) , FACT-Endometrial Cancer ( En ) test ( endometrial cancer ) Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System ( PROMIS ) cancer fatigue short form baseline , midway diet , conclusion diet . 6 . Patient 's nutritional status ( Mini Nutritional Assessment [ MNA ] form ) assess , caloric need calculate . 7 . Local recurrence , progression free survival , distant metastasis overall survival assess .</detailed_description>
