	<detailed_description>The study design single center , post-market , non-randomized , open-label , observational clinical study retrospective prospective enrollment evaluate 2-year post implantation survivorship PyroTITAN™ HRA device follow implementation new proof test identify eliminate device sub-standard mechanical integrity . The result compare data collect prior study conduct implement new proof test . The PyroTITAN™ HRA Shoulder prosthesis device configuration include humeral resurface CAP without cement . Patients select retrospectively prospectively recruitment study base upon normally accept criterion primary shoulder resurface arthroplasty . 137 subject PyroTITAN™ HRA Shoulder prosthesis arthroplasty implant follow 60 month .</detailed_description>
