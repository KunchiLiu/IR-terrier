	<criteria>1 . Age 4 &lt; 13 year 2 . Amblyopia associate strabismus , anisometropia , ( previously treat untreated ) 1 . Criteria strabismic amblyopia : At least one follow must meet : Presence heterotropia examination distance near fixation ( without optical correction , must 5pd SPCT near fixation ( see # 6 ) Documented history strabismus longer present ( judgment investigator could cause amblyopia ) 2 . Criteria anisometropia : At least one follow criterion must meet : ≥1.00 D difference eye spherical equivalent ≥1.50 D difference astigmatism correspond meridian two eye 3 . Criteria combinedmechanism amblyopia : Both follow criterion must meet : Criteria strabismus meet ( see ) ≥1.00 D difference eye spherical equivalent OR ≥1.50 D difference astigmatism correspond meridian two eye 3 . No amblyopia treatment optical correction past 2 week ( patch , atropine , Bangerter , vision therapy , binocular treatment ) 4 . Requirements require refractive error correction ( base cycloplegic refraction complete within last 7 month ) : Hypermetropia 2.50 D spherical equivalent ( SE ) Myopia amblyopic eye 0.50D SE Astigmatism 1.00D Anisometropia 0.50D SE NOTE : Subjects cycloplegic refractive error fall within requirement spectacle correction may give spectacle investigator discretion must follow studyspecified prescribe guideline , detail . 1 . Spectacle prescribe instruction reference cycloplegic refraction complete within last 7 month : SE must within 0.50D fully correct anisometropia . SE must correct 1.50D SE , reduction plus sphere must symmetric two eye . Cylinder power eye must within 0.50D fully correct astigmatism . Axis must within +/ 10 degree cylinder power ≤1.00D , within +/ 5 degree cylinder power &gt; 1.00D . Myopia must undercorrected 0.25D correct 0.50D SE , change must symmetrical two eye . 2 . Spectacle correction meeting criterion must wear : For least 16 week OR VA stability document ( define &lt; 0.1 logMAR change test method measure 2 consecutive exam least 8 week apart ) . For determine VA stability ( nonimprovement ) : The first two measurement may make 1 ) current spectacle , 2 ) trial frame without cycloplegia 3 ) without correction ( new correction prescribe ) , The second measurement must make without cycloplegia correct spectacle wear least 8 week . Note : since determination prestudy procedure , method measure VA mandate . 5 . VA , measure eye without cycloplegia current spectacle correction ( applicable ) within 7 day prior randomization use ATSHOTV VA protocol child &lt; 7 year EETDRS VA protocol child ≥ 7 year studyapproved device display single surround optotypes , follow : 1 . VA amblyopic eye 20/40 20/200 inclusive ( ATSHOTV ) 33 72 letter ( EETDRS ) 2 . VA fellow eye 20/25 better ( ATSHOTV ) ≥ 78 letter ( EETDRS ) 3 . Interocular difference ≥ 3 logMAR line ( ATSHOTV ) ≥ 15 letter ( EETDRS ) 6 . Heterotropia near deviation ≤ 5∆ ( measure SPCT ) habitual correction ( Angles ocular deviation &gt; 5∆ allow large magnitude deviation would compromise successful playing game . ) 7 . Subject able play Dig Rush game ( least level 3 ) study iPad binocular condition ( redgreen glass ) . Subject must able see red `` digger '' blue `` gold cart '' contrast nonamblyopic eye 20 % . 8 . Investigator willing prescribe computer game play , continue spectacle wear per protocol . 9 . Parent understand protocol willing accept randomization . 10 . Parent phone ( access phone ) willing contact Jaeb Center staff study staff . 11 . Relocation outside area active PEDIG site study within next 8 week anticipate . 1 . Prism spectacle correction time enrollment ( eligible prism discontinue 2 week prior enrollment ) . 2 . Myopia great 6.00D spherical equivalent either eye . 3 . Previous intraocular refractive surgery . 4 . Any treatment amblyopia ( patch , atropine , Bangerter filter , vision therapy previous binocular treatment ) past 2 week . Previous amblyopia therapy allow regardless type , must discontinue least 2 week prior enrollment . 5 . Ocular comorbidity may reduce VA determine ocular examination perform within past 7 month ( Note : nystagmus per se exclude subject VA criterion meet ) . 6 . No Down syndrome cerebral palsy 7 . No severe developmental delay would interfere treatment evaluation ( opinion investigator ) . Subjects mild speech delay read and/or learn disability exclude . 8 . Subject demonstrate previous low compliance binocular treatment and/or spectacle treatment ( assess informally investigator )</criteria>
