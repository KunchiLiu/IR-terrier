	<brief_summary>Patients undergo thoracic surgery require selective ventilation one lung , allow surgery proceed operative lung deflate , longer move . One-lung ventilation ( OLV ) may achieve use double lumen endotracheal tube ( DLT ) placement bronchial blocker ( BB ) via single lumen endotracheal tube , routine clinical use University Health Network . Recently , Endobronchial Blocker ( EZ blocker ) market , fork tip design two balloon , one design fall right leave side , may require less reposition . Initial clinical experience EZ Blocker suggest may less likely blocker become malpositioned surgery . This study compare EZ blocker Fuji blocker , frequently use blocker institution , double-lumen tube , commonly use device provide lung isolation , respect intra-operative malpositioning speed lung separation efficacy lung collapse thoracic surgery . Patients randomly assign , one three study group : EZ Blocker , Fuji , left-sided DLT , immediately prior induction anesthesia . The primary end point time lung isolation number require reposition maneuver .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age &gt; 18 year . Thoracic surgery require onelung ventilation &gt; 30 minute . Able provide first party consent . Known prior difficult intubation . Upper airway exam suggestive difficult intubation . Surgical procedure require right double lumen endotracheal tube ( left pneumonectomy ) . Evidence clinically require radiologic imaging abnormal low airway anatomy , right upper lobe origin bronchus . Prior thoracic surgery pleurodesis operative side ( would delay lung collapse ) . History severe restrictive lung disease ( pulmonary fibrosis emphysema ) may affect inflation/deflation time . Trauma patient require videoassisted thoracoscopic surgery Has condition ( ) contraindicate double lumen endotracheal tube ( DLT ) placement bronchial blocker ( BB ) via single lumen endotracheal tube . Patients communication difficulty .</criteria>
