	<brief_title>Effect Misoprostol Reducing Post Partum Hemorrhage After Labor Induction Oxytocin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our study carry Makassed General Hospital , tertiary-level maternity unit perform 1000 delivery annually . After approval hospital Ethics Research Committee , woman single viable pregnancy , cephalic presentation , full term labor induce Oxytocin eligible inclusion . After informed consent obtain , parturients assign randomly accord computer generate sequence block list 25each time receive either 1000mcg Misoprostol rectally 20 unit Oxytocin intravenously run rate 150ml/hr . The medication give cord clamp delivery placenta . Active management third stage labor carry simultaneously early cord clamping , gentle downward traction placenta hasten delivery , uterine massage addition uterotonic accord assignment patient . Assessment uterine condition do obstetrician assistant , together visually estimate amount blood loss . Once uterine atony estimate blood loss ( EBL ) 500 ml notice , another uterotonics administer accord condition discretion obstetrician . Failure achieve adequate uterine contraction control post partum hemorrhage ( PPH ) routine uterine massage urge use either different uterotonics surgical intervention necessary . Blood transfusion order case whose visual estimation blood loss 1000ml patient hemodynamically unstable . In order compare effect medication alone amount blood loss , exclude patient receive blood transfusion additional uterotonics . A base line hemoglobin hematocrit level withdraw admission another reading 12 hour postpartum .</detailed_description>
