	<brief_summary>Researchers want test procedure call deep brain simulation ( DBS ) treat focal hand dystonia ( FHD ) . A device call neurostimulator place chest . It attach wire place brain area affect movement . Stimulating area help block nerve signal cause abnormal movement . Objectives : To test DBS treatment FHD . To learn brain nerve cell function people dystonia . Eligibility : People age 18 old severe FHD try botulinum toxin treatment least twice Design : Participation last 5 year . Participants screen : Medical history Physical exam Videotape dystonia Blood , urine , heart test Brain MRI scan Chest X-ray Neuropsychological test : answer question , simple action , take memory thinking test . Hand movement test Participants surgery : A frame fixes head operate table . A small hole make skull . Wires inserted record brain activity stimulate brain simple task . The wire remove DBS electrode insert hole . The neurostimulator place skin chest , wire run electrode brain . They CT MRI scan surgery . Participants recover hospital 1 week . The neurostimulator turn 1 4 week discharge . Participants regular visit study end . Visits include : Checking symptom side effect MRI Movement , thinking , memory test If neurostimulator battery run , participant surgery replace .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives To confirm safety efficacy thalamic deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) target ventralis oralis anterior/ventralis oralis posterior ( VOA/VOP ) nuclear complex treatment subject focal hand dystonia ( FHD ) ; study electrophysiologic property neuron VOA/VOP complex . Deep brain stimulation DBS FDA approve Parkinson disease , Essential tremor , Dystonia ( humanitarian exemption ) , Obsessive- Compulsive disorder ( humanitarian exemption ) focal hand dystonia . Study population Five adult focal hand dystonia study . Design This pilot study 5 subject severe intractable FHD whose activity daily live quality life severely impaired . They recruit clinic neurology practice DC metro area University Virginia . The subject undergo unilateral VOA/VOP DBS implantation , follow program optimal parameter . The subject follow monthly interval 3 month , every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 5 year start . The safety procedure primary outcome study . Efficacy assess several secondary outcome , important one change dystonia severity quality life score . The electrophysiologic feature motor ventral thalamic neuron record intraoperatively . Outcome measure Primary -Number severity adverse event 5-year follow-up period . Secondary - Upper extremity disability sub-score Burke-Fahn-Marsden ( BFM ) scale Arm Dystonia Disability Scale ( ADDS ) baseline every follow visit - For subject FHD type musician dystonia : Tubiana Chamagne scale every follow visit - For subject FHD type Writer cramp : Writer Cramp Impairment Scale - Improvement patient report outcomes evaluate SF-12 Health Status Survey baseline every follow visit - Intraoperatory electrophysiologic characteristic motor ventral thalamic neuron - Neuropsychological evaluation baseline , 3 12 month post DBS surgery</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : FHD diagnose neurologist BFM disability subscore 3 ( score range 0 4 ) ADDS scale equal 3 . Patients must score 3 Tubiana Chamagne scale inability perform concert level patient must score rating marked impairment least one item , impact patient employment essential activity Writer Cramp scale symptom function . Symptoms cause significant impairment quality life daily activity patient selfassessment SF12 scale , report subject . The subject severely impair least one follow domain : handwriting , type play instrument . The impairment need affected employment , manifest substantive change , loss , employment career choice . All patient must fail least two trial botulinum toxin injection treatment . Women childbearing age agree use contraception method first 3 post operative month . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects young 22 year old . Subjects abnormal MRI brain Subjects prior brain surgery Pregnant nursing woman Presence widespread neurologic syndrome dystonia part , and/or dystonia cause ongoing etiology , tardive dystonia associate ongoing psychotropic treatment inherit neurodegenerative syndrome associate intractable dystonia Cognitive impairment Full Scale Intelligence Quotient ( FSIQ ) portion Wechsler Adult Intelligence test , would render participant able provide inform consent comply study procedure ( FSIQ less Dementia evidence formal neuropsychological evaluation Mattis Dementia Rating Scale2 ( DRS2 ) score 128 . Depressed subject determine neuropsychology screen , include Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI ) . Subjects score 20 BDI exclude Subjects uncontrolled coexist medical condition : uncontrolled systemic hypertension value 170/100 ; active heart disease need immediate intervention ; active respiratory disease need immediate intervention ; uncorrected coagulation abnormality ; condition would render thepatient unable safely cooperate surgery study test judge screen physician Presence contraindication undergo brain MRI Subjects implant drug pump , pacemaker , defibrillator , neurostimulators , metallic implant head Subjects require diathermy Subjects require postop MRIs full body coil Subjects active systematic infection Subjects immunecompromised Subjects anticoagulation therapy would preclude ability undergo implant procedure Subjects allergic show hypersensitivity material neurostimulation system may come contact body Subjects appoint Durable power attorney ( DPA )</criteria>
