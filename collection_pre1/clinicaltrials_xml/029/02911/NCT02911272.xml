	<brief_summary>Objective : To compare active labour outcome nulliparous woman term supervise partograph action line place either 2 hour 4 hour determine whether 2-hour action line placement good prevention prolong labour . Design : Randomised controlled trial . Setting : A university teach hospital Nigeria . Population : Nulliparous woman labour term . Method : Nulliparous woman labour randomly supervise partograph action line place 2 hour ( n=320 ) 4 hour ( n=320 ) . Oxytocin augmentation , require , use 2-hour ( n=87 ) 4-hour ( n=61 ) action line . Progress monitor group . Main outcome measure : The primary outcome measure prolong labour rate . The secondary outcome measure mode delivery neonatal outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Materials method This prospective , randomise control study conduct April 2008 April 2013 . The labour ward staff good knowledge use partograph , partographs routinely supply labour ward . The department management protocol use partograph labour supervision parturients labour . In addition , audit review labour manage parturients occur every morning workdays assess compliance management protocol , ensure continuous instruction staff partograph use labour supervision . At time admission , study participant nulliparous , 37 42 week gestation , spontaneous active phase labour intact fetal membrane singleton , cephalic-presenting fetus . The exclusion criterion prior antepartum haemorrhage , medical disorder pregnancy poor fetal growth pregnancy . All woman fulfil inclusion criterion antenatal period approximately 34-36 week select , participate informative discussion study sign write consent . The study approve UBTH research ethic committee review study protocol inform consent detail . However , final inclusion study limit previously select woman arrive labour ward term spontaneous active-phase labour intact fetal membrane still exclusion criterion . Upon present labour ward confirm active labour , consent woman randomise either two study arm : labour supervision composite partograph action line location 2 hour 4 hour alert line physician blind participant . Allocation study arm perform use consecutively number , seal , opaque envelope randomise sequence use computer random number generator statistician involve care . A sample size determination 2-hour versus 4-hour oxytocin augmentation labour type 1 error ( alpha ) 10 % type II error ( beta ) 20 % together power 80 % level significance 0.05 perform basis previous study effect different partograph action line birth outcomes . Recruitment arm study calculate require 320 participant . The enrolment woman study continued sample size 320 achieve study group , 2-hour 4-hour action line . There therefore exclusion . Data statistical analysis Collected data check completeness analyse use SPSS version 17 ( SPSS Inc. , 233 South Wackor Drive , Chicago , Illinois 60606-6412 , USA ) . Bivariate analyse perform use chi-square test difference proportion 2-hour 4-hour line categorical variable , odds ratio ( ORs ) respective confidence interval calculate . Continuous variable compare use unpaired t-tests . A p-value &lt; 0.05 consider indicative statistical significance . According departmental protocol spontaneous labour management , active-phase labour define least one progressive contraction every 10-minute interval parturient term cervical o confirm 4cm . The fetal membrane instantly rupture vaginal examination ( VE ) , confirm active-phase labour parturients facilitate cervical o dilatation 1 cm per hour intact fetal membrane cause slow labour progress active-phase labour . Findings admission first VE active labour feto-maternal vital sign record partograph . The feto-maternal vital sign subsequently record hourly partograph . The timing repeat VE depend location action line partograph , parturient randomly allocate . For woman allocate 2-hour action line partograph , repeat VEs occur every 2 hour . Women 4-hour group receive repeat VEs every 4 hour unless cervical o dilatation first VE 7cm , case repeat VE perform earlier 4 hour . The cervical o dilatation first subsequent VE finding plot partograph show graph cervical o dilatation . When cervical o dilatation progress cross alert line , progress regard normal , subsequent care delivery perform midwife junior obstetrics staff resident doctor . When cervical o dilatation progress plot partograph cross alert line , midwife transfer case obstetric team subsequent care delivery . Although parturients admit labour ward first VE conduct midwife record partograph , midwife obstetric resident staff status senior obstetric resident allow perform VE twice within 2 4 hour parturient active-phase labour . The need third VE midwife junior obstetric staff ( senior resident ) consider indication transfer parturient care senior obstetric staff skill manage long-duration active-phase labour . This strategy ensure involvement senior obstetric staff treatment woman remain active-phase labour . Oxytocin augmentation treatment slow labour progress institute 2-hour 4-hour action line cross , quality frequency uterine contraction assess method . The oxytocin base mixture titration regimen study departmental protocol . A parturient oxytocin labour augmentation assign midwife act companion monitor infusion regimen . The maximum duration oxytocin augmentation 8hours absence fetal distress . When augmentation occur 4 hour , senior obstetric resident manage case require inform consultant call duty , also require involved caesarean delivery-related decision parturient labour , especially augmentation labour . According protocol , partograph set use tool deployment labour ward staff management active-phase labour cooperation midwife obstetric staff . By arrangement , parturients whose labour progress cross alert line manage delivered midwife , parturients whose labour progress cross action line pass care senior experienced obstetric staff effective efficient labour care . Prolonged labour , define departmental protocol study , define active-phase labour duration 12 hour . The third stage labour actively manage minimise blood loss . On first day post-delivery , woman vaginal delivery interview use likert scale score model regard satisfaction intervention base partograph action line placement analysis one author blind action line placement . Those delivered c/s interview conduct third day post-delivery .</detailed_description>
