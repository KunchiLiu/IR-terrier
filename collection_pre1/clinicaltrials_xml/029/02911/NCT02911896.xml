	<brief_summary>Impairment physical function significant problem survivor critical illness . There grow urgency develop core set outcome measure , adopt clinical research practice evaluate efficacy response intervention rehabilitation . Phase 1 : Development new outcome measure . This study aim examine development single outcome measure may able utilised across continuum recovery critical illness evaluation physical function . The study involve examination two common physical function measure - Physical Function intensive care test score ( PFIT-s ) De Morton Mobility Index ( DEMMI ) development new measure base rasch principle may able capture physical functioning change individual critical illness . Aims : ( 1 ) To determine clinical utility two physical function measure ( DEMMI PFIT-s ) use isolation across hospital admission ; ( 2 ) To transform ( 15-item ) DEMMI ( 4-item ) PFIT-s single measure evaluate function intensive care survivor use Rasch analytical principle . Phase 2 : Measurement property PACIFIC physical function outcome measure independent validation sample .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Consecutive eligible patient recruit study . Phase 1 : Two outcome measure - PFIT-s DEMMI perform within 24 hour period . Order test randomised minimise test bias . Time-points assessment : awakening , ICU discharge hospital discharge . Weekly measure also perform require ICU and/or ward setting maximum 30 day set . The measurement property individual tool PFIT-s DEMMI examine ( e.g . validity , responsiveness ) . Phase 2 : Based finding Phase 1 new single outcome measure develop . In second phase examination measurement property tool undertaken include ( reliability , validity , responsiveness ) .</detailed_description>
