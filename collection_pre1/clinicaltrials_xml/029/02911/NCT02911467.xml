	<detailed_description>This prospective imaging study evaluate utility baseline metabolic MR image predictive response biomarker androgen signal inhibition patient castration-resistant prostate cancer . Patients target lesion amenable metabolic MR image eligible study participation . Patients undergo baseline metabolic MR image Hyperpolarized Pyruvate C-13 pyruvate follow initiation androgen signal inhibition ( either standard care part clinical trial ; include abiraterone and/or enzalutamide treatment ) . Patient subsequently undergo repeat metabolic MR scan 28 day ( +/- 7 day ) therapy . For without primarily refractory disease , third metabolic MR scan complete time radiographic disease progression The Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 2 ( PCWG2 ) criterion . MR- CT-guided tumor biopsy optional baseline time disease progression .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Biopsyproven prostate cancer . 2 . Progressive , castrationresistant disease accord PCWG2 criterion . 3 . Planned treatment androgen signal inhibitor ( e.g. , abiraterone , enzalutamide , apalutamide ( ARN509 ) ) . Patients must receive androgen signal inhibitor time baseline MR scan . Combination treatment ( e.g. , androgen signal inhibitor conjunction another systemic treatment ) allow . 4 . Presence least one target lesion detect standard staging scan , judgment Study Investigators , would amenable hyperpolarized C13 pyruvate/metabolic MR imaging : Soft tissue/visceral organ target lesion must measure 1.5 cm long axis diameter CT MRI . Target lesions bone must visualize CT MRI ( lesion present bone scan qualify ) . For patient target lesion prostate/prostatic bed : . No contraindication endorectal coil insertion ( e.g. , patient prior abdominoperineal resection rectum latex allergy ) . ii . No prior local treatment select lesion . Patients receive prior radiation ablative therapy prostate require biopsyproven evidence disease recurrence follow completion local therapy . 5 . The subject able willing comply study procedure provide sign date informed consent . 6 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance Status 0 1 . 7 . Adequate organ function , include absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1500 cells/µL , hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 gm/dL , platelet ≥ 75,000 cells/µL , creatinine &lt; 1.5 x ULN estimate creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min ( Cockcroft Gault equation ) , bilirubin &lt; 1.5x ULN ( unless Gilbert 's suspected case total bilirubin &lt; 3 x ULN ) , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) &lt; 1.5x ULN . 8 . For patient undergoing optional tumor biopsy : No history bleed diathesis . Patients anticoagulation must able safely stop treatment purpose tumor biopsy . 9 . For patient partner childbearing potential , willing use adequate contraception one month undergo HP pyruvate infusion . 10 . Patients must prior bilateral orchiectomy continuous luteinizinghormone release hormone ( LHRH ) analogue therapy duration study . 11 . Castrate level serum testosterone ( &lt; 50 ng/dL ) study entry . 1 . Patients age , general medical psychiatric condition , physiologic status give valid inform consent . 2 . Patients unwilling unable undergo MR imaging , include patient contraindication MRI , cardiac pacemaker noncompatible intracranial vascular clip . 3 . Metallic hip implant metallic implant device distorts local magnetic field compromise quality MR imaging . 4 . Poorly control hypertension , define systolic blood pressure study entry great 160 mm Hg diastolic blood pressure great 100 mm Hg . The addition antihypertensives control blood pressure allow . 5 . Congestive heart failure New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) status ≥ 2 . 6 . A history clinically significant EKG abnormality , include QT prolongation ( QTcF &gt; 500 m ) , family history prolong QT interval syndrome , myocardial infarction ( MI ) within 6 month study entry . Patients ratecontrolled atrial fibrillation/flutter allow study . 7 . Any condition , opinion Principal Investigator , would impair patient 's ability comply study procedure .</criteria>
