	<brief_title>IV Tranexamic Acid Prior Hysterectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tranexamic acid ( TXA ) synthetic lysine analog inhibits plasmin fibrinolysis . It may administer orally , intravenously , topically , rapid onset action ( tmax = appx 3 hour ) 11-hour half-life . It 6 10 time potent aminocaproic acid , another commonly use synthetic antifibrinolytic agent . Typical IV dose 10 mg/kg follow infusion 1mg/kg/hour , simply 1g intravenously one dose . The efficacy tranexamic acid control hemorrhage trauma patient report extensively . The CRASH-2 trial collaborator randomize 20,211 adult trauma patient significant bleed risk significant bleeding within 8 hour injury IV tranexamic acid placebo . All-cause mortality significantly reduce tranexamic acid ( RR .91 ; p = .0035 ) . Additionally , risk death due bleed significantly low receive tranexamic acid ( RR .85 ; p = .0077 ) . No difference risk vascular occlusive event note . Further analysis reveal reduce risk death bleed TXA give within 3 hour injury ; treatment administer 3 hour injury increase risk death due bleeding . Administration TXA elective surgery also investigate . A 2011 systematic review 252 randomized trial patient undergo elective surgery across discipline include administration TXA , aminocaproic acid , aprotinin . TXA administration reduce risk transfusion peri-operatively ( RR .61 ) . A 2012 meta-analysis TXA use elective emergency surgery reveal TXA reduce risk transfusion one-third . The effect TXA risk myocardial infarction , deep vein thrombosis , pulmonary embolism statistically significant . The utility TXA appear extend obstetric hemorrhage . Several publish study exist analyze use prevention postpartum hemorrhage , though drug consider standard prevention treatment condition . A pilot randomize open-label trial IV TXA woman postpartum hemorrhage 800cc report low median blood loss group , though effect modest . Additionally , significantly few woman TXA group require transfusion invasive procedure . A recent Cochrane review report twelve trial low risk woman undergo cesarean section spontaneous birth receive uterotonics without addition TXA . TXA effective decreasing estimate blood loss 1 liter woman undergo cesarean section . Mean blood loss significantly low woman receive TXA ( mean difference -77.79mL ) ; effect similar woman undergo cesarean section vaginal birth . Finally , WOMAN trial large , ongoing , placebo-controlled trial examine effect early TXA administration clinically diagnose postpartum hemorrhage . The use TXA management acute abnormal uterine bleeding report , FDA-approved treatment menorrhagia . One randomize study oral TXA treatment ovulatory menorrhagia report 45 % decrease mean menstrual blood loss use TXA compare placebo . Other study echo finding , TXA effective NSAIDs less effective levonorgestrel intrauterine device ( IUD ) decrease menstrual blood loss . More recently , double-blind , placebo-controlled randomized-controlled trial ( RCT ) confirm significant decrease menstrual blood loss ( mean -69cc ) , improvements social/physical limitation cause menorrhagia self-perceived menstrual blood loss . No data exist examine efficacy IV TXA management acute severe uterine bleeding . Few study specifically examine utility prophylactic TXA reduce mean blood loss hysterectomy gynecologic procedure . In one study patient undergo endometrial ablation endoscopic endometrial resection , intraoperative postoperative IV TXA significantly decrease total blood loss . In patient undergo major debulking surgery gynecologic cancer , administration IV TXA show decrease intra-operative blood loss 30 % . One well-designed study woman advanced-stage ovarian cancer randomize patient 15 mg/kg IV TXA volume placebo immediately surgery . Outcomes include significantly low mean estimate blood loss decrease need transfusion TXA group . This study seek determine whether single preoperative dose IV tranexamic acid effectively reduce intraoperative blood loss need transfusion patient undergo laparoscopic , abdominal , vaginal hysterectomy benign indication . Objective : To determine effect 1g IV tranexamic acid give within 1 hour pre-operatively intraoperative blood loss time hysterectomy . Primary endpoint : Estimated blood loss determine anesthesia surgeon time hysterectomy , difference post-operative pre-operative hemoglobin , length hospital stay , length procedure , need blood transfusion post-operative venous thromboembolic event . Treatment Dosage Administration : 1g IV tranexamic acid 100ml 0.9 % sodium chloride solution administer within 1 hour start procedure</detailed_description>
