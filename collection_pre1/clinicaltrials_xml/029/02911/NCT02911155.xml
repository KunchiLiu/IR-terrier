	<brief_summary>Background : The field nuclear medicine change lot past decade . Technology gotten well , patient expose less radiation . But worker procedure often use lead apron less . So may expose radiation . This may put high risk cancer health problem relate radiation . Researchers want collect data technologist learn risk appropriate dos radiation . Objective : To learn risk appropriate dos radiation nuclear medicine technologist . Eligibility : Adults first certify nuclear medicine technology United States 1980 . They must live United States . They must participant USRT study . Design : Participants recruit online . Participants complete online survey . It take half hour . This question work nuclear medicine procedure . There question kind procedure often . Participants give short work history . This include names current past employer . Participants allow researcher get record film badge dose reading . These come dosimetry provider . Dosimetry data share participant . Researchers ensure accurate complete data .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The field nuclear medicine expand rapidly since inception mid-20th century , nuclear medicine technologist potentially experience high level radiation exposure relative medical worker population . Many radiopharmaceutical procedure use previous decade obsolete replace new emerge radioisotope combined-modality molecular imaging procedure . While improvement image technology introduction certain radioisotope generally reduce patient exposure radiation , nuclear medicine technologists become increasingly specialized newer procedure perform nuclear medicine procedure increase frequency . Furthermore , lead apron less effective protect worker nuclear medicine procedure , specifically higher-energy procedure ( e.g. , positron emission tomography ( PET ) ) , compare radiation-related procedure , seldom used technologist perform nuclear medicine . As result , cumulative dos nuclear medicine technologist expect increased . We hypothesize certified nuclear medicine technologist may experience high risk radiation-related cancer adverse health outcome compare medical specialty group . There currently little information radiation-related risk associate performing procedure due , part , limited information occupational dos associate current nuclear medicine practice . To characterize organ-specific dos could later use quantify risk specific radiation-related disease outcome , either directly ( subsequent follow-up ) indirectly ( risk projection method ) , plan collect detailed work history information nuclear medicine procedure associate radiation safety practice , well badge dos , representative sample 1,500 technologist certify nuclear medicine U.S . This information complement similar data collect 2013-2014 independent sample approximately 4,500 general radiologic technologists U.S. Radiologic Technologists Study ( USRT ) report working procedure . However , unlike USRT sample , propose sample expect higher-risk , include worker specialty certification nuclear medicine begin work nuclear medicine procedure much earlier career , age associate great susceptibility radiation-related carcinogenesis .</detailed_description>
