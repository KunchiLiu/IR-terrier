	<brief_title>APAP-CYS Protein Adduct Concentrations Patients With Liver-Directed Therapy Intended Treat Hepatic Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acetaminophen-cysteine protein adduct ( APAP-CYS ) form acetaminophen oxidized CYP 2E-1 . When hepatocytes die , protein release serum detect . APAP-CYS therefore experimental biomarker acetaminophen exposure . It possible massive necrosis hepatocytes contain APAP-CYS therapeutic dos acetaminophen misinterpret acetaminophen overdose cause liver injury . This study aim describe serum APAP-CYS concentration patient take therapeutic dose acetaminophen develop liver injury cause acetaminophen . This study seek enroll subject undergoing hepatic embolization procedure treat secondary liver tumor . This procedure reproducible model non-acetaminophen induced hepatic injury . A small number subject otherwise eligible participate unwilling take acetaminophen offer participation observational arm study . They undergo assessment exception acetaminophen dose . Subjects willing take acetaminophen ask take extra strength acetaminophen ( 4g/day ) 3 day prior embolization procedure . All subject ask keep detailed medication diary three day prior embolization procedure . Blood sample measurement APAP-CYS concentration marker liver function collect prior acetaminophen dosing , prior embolization procedure , several time point procedure .</detailed_description>
