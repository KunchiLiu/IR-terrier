	<brief_summary>Tuberculosis ( TB ) one opportunistic infection often see HIV individual . In 2013 , estimate 31,800 HIV-TB co-infection case 6,100 HIV-related death due TB Americas . Due non-specific nature clinical symptom , TB confuse various disease histoplasmosis , sarcoidosis , lymphoma , pneumonia . In Panama , Histoplasma capsulatum endemic , diagnose TB versus histoplasmosis base clinical symptom difficult . In Panama , approximately 7.65 % HIV patient co-infected histoplasmosis , 30 % mortality rate HIV-histoplasmosis patient Latin America . Due similar clinical feature , misdiagnosis active TB disseminate histoplasmosis endemic region may lead incorrect antibiotic management , turn result unnecessary toxicity , antibiotic resistance , monetary expenditure . The investigator interest lie increase TB diagnostic accuracy use simple urine dipstick test evaluate physician response new diagnostic testing , order reduce misdiagnosis improve health outcome HIV population .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Additive Benefit Urine LAM Test Current TB Diagnostics HIV Positive Adults Panama City , Panama</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The gold standard TB diagnosis , mycobacterial culture , limit slow turnaround time , need skilled technician biosafety level 3 facility . Another diagnostic test , Xpert MTB/RIF , produce same-day result , boast specificity 98 % , limited HIV population sensitivity 67 % ( single sputum sample ) . High cost associate test present major obstacle routine use ( US $ 65,500 16-module instrument , US $ 9.98 US $ 18.00 per cartridge ) . The urine lipoarabinomannan ( LAM ) Ag test specificity 98.6 % sensitivity 66.7 % patient CD4 count 50 . LAM 17.5kD glycolipid virulence factor mycobacteria . The test 's sensitivity improve advanced HIV case higher bacillary burden , frequent disseminate TB , great concentration urine antigen due less antigen-antibody formation , HIV nephropathy . The test strip contain positive negative control quality assurance , utilize fresh urine sample store room temperature 8 hour collection . In right clinical setting , urine LAM Ag test could important additive benefit TB diagnosis HIV individual combine current standard care . This study investigate physician management patient outcome change urine LAM test add current TB diagnostic test ( mycobacterial culture occasional use Xpert MTB/RIF ) . The national referral hospital Panama , Hospital Santo Tomás , ideal study site give dedicated HIV inpatient service high TB histoplasmosis burden . Histoplasmosis diagnosis often base clinical symptom alone , less frequently confirm skin bone marrow biopsy . Due diagnostic uncertainty , 40 % HIV patient fever cough receive dual TB histoplasmosis therapy . Their current standard TB care include sputum AFB microscopy culture . However , rapid result available sputum AFB , sensitivity approximately 30 % . The urine LAM Ag test presently use . When combined urine LAM Ag test , sputum AFB sensitivity 25 % ( CD4 &gt; 200 ) 72 % ( CD4 &lt; 50 ) . Over next year , investigator plan study change physician diagnostic classification management decision introduction urine LAM Ag test . This information would aid TB diagnosis , also investigator understand physician integrate new information . The main objective determine effect urine LAM Ag test result reduce dual TB/histoplasmosis therapy , compare rate duration dual therapy urine LAM group retrospective control group . The investigator second objective investigate barrier incorporate urine LAM Ag test result impact physician ' approach treatment use physician questionnaire . A clinical trial study conduct use HIV positive patient June 2016 June 2017 present pertinent clinical criterion Hospital Santo Tomás . Following urine LAM Ag test administration , result immediately provide treating physician . The control group consist retrospectively select patient Hospital Santo Tomás database fit inclusion exclusion , match age , sex , clinical severity . Patient outcome data collect day hospital admittance time discharge . Following conclusion data collection , consent physician interview benefit barrier incorporate urine LAM Ag test within practice .</detailed_description>
