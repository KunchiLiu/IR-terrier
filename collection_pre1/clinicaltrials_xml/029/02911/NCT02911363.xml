	<brief_title>Comparison Captivator Tissue Cassettes vs. Cassettes Endoscopic Mucosal Resection Esophageal Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As result advance endoscopic procedure , detection early stage esophageal carcinoma increase . Endoscopic mucosal resection ( EMR ) innovative technique removal high grade intraepithelial neoplasia/dysplasia prevent progression invasive carcinoma occur third patient . EMR involve endoscopic therapeutic removal abnormal esophageal area ( ) tissue snare suction , aim include much submucosal layer possible , ( ) submit histopathological examination pathological diagnosis tumor stag . Compared esophageal biopsy , methodology reveals advance tumor stage term grade vertical infiltration 10-20 % patient . Because importance histopathologic diagnosis , specimen pin cork styrofoam board prevent curl maintain orientation , integrity size shape , fix appropriate volume 10 % formalin . Unfortunately , specimen often pin EMR specimen difficult time consume pin thickness , hence specimen integrity ( size shape ) orientation compromise . Therefore main purpose study two-fold ; firstly determine whether use Captivator tissue cassette effect preservation tissue histology ( minimize artifactual curling ) , secondly determine whether use intraprocedural cassette practical . The investigator believe greatly aid elucidate best technique optimize performance EMR esophageal lesion .</detailed_description>
