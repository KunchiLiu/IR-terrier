	<brief_summary>Chlorhexidine gold standard dental plaque prevention , concentration effective know . The aim present study compare plaque gingivitis inhibit effect commercial product contain 0.2 % , 0.12 % 0.06 % chlorhexidine modify experimental gingivitis model . In three group healthy volunteer , experimental gingivitis induce monitor 21days , simultaneously treat commercial solution contain 0.2 % , 0.12 % 0.06 % chlorhexidine . The maxillary right quadrant individual receive mouthwash , whereas maxillary leave quadrant subject rinse mechanical oral hygiene . Compliance side effect monitor day 7 , 14 , 21 . Plaque gingivitis score obtain baseline day 21 . The commercial mouthwash contain 0.2 % chlorhexidine result statistically significantly low plaque score 0.12 0.06 % mouthwash 21 day use , whereas statistically significant difference find effect two latter mouthrinses . A commercial available mouthwash contain 0.2 % chlorhexidine prove statistically significant well effect prevent dental plaque 0.12 % 0.06 % solution .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The present study design parallel , double mask , randomize , placebo-controlled clinical trial . The experimental gingivitis model , modification Preus coworkers use induce gingival inflammation supervise condition throughout study . The study population comprise sixty dental , medical , dental hygienist student volunteered participate project . A meeting arranged volunteer prior start study , participant receive information oral rinsing product general chlorhexidine containing product well information study ahead , particular . The study period 21 day , comprise special academic , religious ethnic event could jeopardize collective behavior study population . All information , administration data collection perform Department Periodontology , Institute Clinical Odontology , Faculty Dentistry , University Oslo , Norway . The test solution commercially available mouthwash product : 0.2 % chlorhexidine ( ethanol ) , 0.12 % chlorhexidine 910 ppm Sodium Fluoride ( NaF ) without ethanol 0.06 % chlorhexidine 250ppm Sodium Fluoride ( NaF ) . The three commercially available chlorhexidine solution fill identical , differently label ( A , B , C ) plastic bottle blind purpose . Randomization carry use computer generate random allocation table , assign participant three study group 20 test subject . They carefully instruct rinse 60 sec . twice day recommend manufacturer . Setting baseline dental plaque score zero do give participant professional tooth clean rubber cup , pumice paste dental floss start study . The participant give test solution subsequently instruct rinse describe . All information give verbally well write . Individual plastic tooth guard produce fit teeth upper right quadrant . Together individual tooth guard , student give identical prophylaxis pack contain medium texture tooth brush , inter-dental floss dentifrice . The participant instruct substitute daily oral hygiene remedy one give , attach tooth guard tooth brush , provide rubber string , use use always remember use brush . The participant instruct insert tooth guard first quadrant every time brush teeth perform mechanical oral hygiene routine twice daily three quadrant . They rinse 30 sec tap water remove tooth guard remove much possible remnant dentifrice . Following procedure , participant rinse , instruct , solution randomly assign , repeat procedure 21 day . Following score day 21 , participant receive professional tooth clean end study . A team five people trained procedure inform participant , receive test person evaluation , questionnaire clinically monitoring . The principal investigator project manager manage contact participant outside score room . In appointment project team keep touch test person text message e-mail . The success service evident zero no-shows clinic , case also previous study design . At interview day 7 , 14 , 21 project manager receive report participant compliance ( adherence protocol ) verbal complaint description subjective side-effects . A special questionnaire prepared interview . Reports ill- side effect carefully register categorize later statistical examination . At day 21 , mention interview follow examination clinical result . Before enter score room project manager advise participant refrain conversation score scientist inside . The recorder instruct likewise . In score room , two researcher obtain clinical data . The Loe Silness plaque - gingival index record mesial , buccal , distal palatal aspect teeth 16 , 15 , 14 , 13 23 , 24 , 25 , 26 . Adverse event like discoloration observe clinical examination ( yes/no ) clinically visible oral mucosal reaction register . In addition , plaque index Quigley Hine , Turesky modification , register . All clinical registration perform experienced periodontist , leave colleague register recording specially design chart . The clinical crew keep blind group allocation participant time , one access code-book statistician participate clinical event . Statistics The present experiment aim compare plaque gingivitis prevent effect 0.12 % - 0.06 % chlorhexidine solution gold standard 0.2 % chlorhexidine group . The total number participant 60 , 20 participant group . The number participant base follow power calculation . The power analysis base variable 'average plaque score participant ' . When compare average plaque score two group , two-sided independent sample t-test use , 5 % significance level . Average standard deviation 3 group 0.40 . It may show order 80 % test power detect mean difference average plaque score least 0.40 two group , least 15 participant must include group . Because drop-outs expect , decide include 60 subject study . Because 80 % test power generally accept sufficiently high clinical study , mean difference mesial plaque score group 1 group 3 0.41 , calculation suggest study acceptable test power . When compare mean plaque score two group , two-sided independent sample t-test use , 5 % significance level . When compare proportion subject particular adverse effect , `` linear linear association chi-square '' test use . The statistical analysis conduct use software Statistical Package Social Sciences ( SPSS ) Windows , Version 16.0 . The distribution outcome variable check , find sufficiently close normal distribution allow use t-test .</detailed_description>
