	<detailed_description>Previous preliminary research study suggest diet devoid milk dairy product might useful people autism spectrum reduce certain type behaviour symptom affect quality life . Aggravation symptoms autism suggest link constituent milk , particular natural breakdown product milk protein call beta-casomorphin 1-7 ( BC 1-7 BCM-7 ) find majority mammalian dairy product . A dairy-free diet ( casein-free diet ) however difficult diet follow may increase risk certain nutrient miss diet . Anecdotal evidence suggest different type milk different breed cattle ( cow ) may carry biological effect autism spectrum . Milk typically find supermarket naturally contain BC1-7 function type cow produce milk protein contain ( A1 variant beta casein protein ) . The investigator aim test whether particular type milk ( A1 beta casein free milk also call a2 Milk™ ) might able replace casein-free diet child autism spectrum also present attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) type symptom . The investigator look potential effect A1 beta casein free milk behaviour various biological process go body . The source A1 beta casein free milk commercially available a2 Milk™ brand milk directly comparable regular supermarket buy milk exception beta casein component already available buy . In double-blind , randomise , placebo-controlled trial , effect milk free A1 beta casein ( brand milk call a2 milk™ ) milk contain A1 beta casein compare sample pre-pubescent child diagnose autism spectrum disorder concurrent feature attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) . Forty child base North East England initially recruit ; possess communicative speech language . A baseline assessment conduct include behavioural , psychometric health-related parameter . Following random allocation , participant assign group A group B give A1 milk a2 Milk™ initially period 4 week . At point , baseline assessment measure repeat . Milk type cross group 4 week . At study endpoint , baseline assessment measure repeat . Data derive study analyse outcomes report peer-review format . During course study , form dairy product consumption ( cheese , yogurt , etc ) exclude diet participant irrespective treatment allocation . Data supervise baseline , midpoint endpoint psychometric behavioural assessment make stored via secure survey website access via tablet supply participant .</detailed_description>
