	<brief_summary>Contrast-enhanced ultrasound ( CEUS ) promise non-invasive image tool may aid early detection kidney transplant complication , delay graft function ( DGF ) acute allograft rejection . The technique use intravenous contrast agent improve organ visualization standard duplex ultrasound equipment . A number FDA-approved agent , include Optison , Definity Lumason widely use improve visualization technically limited echocardiogram , Lumason recently approve contrast-enhanced ultrasound liver . The specific aim study : develop , implement refine contrast-enhanced ultrasound protocol use Lumason safely maximize kidney allograft visualization ; determine association contrast-enhanced ultrasound pattern allograft injury consistent delay graft function ; compare contrast-enhanced ultrasound duplex ultrasound differentiate acute rejection cause dysfunction .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Kidney transplantation prefer treatment end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) give improve quality life , long survival low cost compare chronic dialysis . Despite long-term benefit , first year post-transplant critical period influence health care cost transplantation long-term patient allograft survival . The two common complication first year delay graft function ( DGF ) , affect nearly 25 % deceased-donor transplant , acute allograft rejection , affect nearly 10 % transplant ( decease live donor ) . DGF commonly cause severe ischemia-reperfusion injury transplantation know risk factor acute rejection premature failure . Driven ever-growing transplant wait list limited organ , effort utilize higher-risk kidney increasingly higher-risk recipient may increase complication rate . While treatment exist DGF acute rejection , current diagnostic paradigm obtain duplex ultrasound ( DUS ) allograft , base serial change serum creatinine , proceed biopsy clinical concern rejection . Biopsy gold standard differentiate cause allograft dysfunction , procedure invasive typically take 24 hour long interpretation . Thus , early detection complication use non-invasive diagnostic method ( major transplant research goal ) could reduce reliance biopsy help improve long-term patient allograft survival . Researchers United States safely perform contrast-enhanced ultrasound kidney healthy participant , radiologist use ultrasound contrast agent off-label good visualize organ heart clinically indicate . In term kidney transplant , European data suggest CEUS allograft post-operative day ( POD ) 7 superior DUS predict 12-month allograft function , publish study use CEUS POD 1 diagnose DGF acute rejection . The pathophysiology DGF acute rejection involve interaction microvasculature , parenchymal cell inflammatory cell , though difference time within different zone kidney . A important feature CEUS capacity measure microvascular perfusion , whereas DUS estimate flow within large vessel . This potential innovation assess renal macro- microvasculature may allow early non-invasive detection DGF acute rejection . With additional research , may ultimately show non-invasive CEUS revolutionize early DGF acute rejection diagnosis enable improvement long-term patient allograft survival .</detailed_description>
