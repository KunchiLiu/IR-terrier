	<brief_summary>The use arthroscopy surgery wrist fracture great health economic impact ( prolongs time surgery , require adequately trained personnel , increase time surgical expense risk complication , however , return ameliorate prognosis improve functional recovery ) . There clinical trial show sufficient level evidence compare result surgical treatment fracture volar plate add arthroscopy necessary perform clinical trial appropriate design sufficient sample size elucidate usefulness arthroscopy wrist fracture . Therefore , investigator want perform open control clinical trial adequately analyze role arthroscopy surgical treatment wrist fracture investigator hospital . The main objective study probe arthroscopy effectiveness functionality injure wrist PRWE ( questionnaire assess pain wrist function ) treatment group trial 12 month surgery investigator plan phase IV multicenter clinical trial .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Informed consent Patients able read understand consent . Patients 18 year Broken wrist surgery criterion base follow criterion ( must meet ) : Patients functionally independent , ie , make purchase without help , categorize accord Mackenney patient require assisted support crutch / walker walking . Radiographic unacceptable reduction 1 attempt closed reduction ER , define : 1. dorsal angulation &gt; 0 ° 2. ulnar variance &gt; 3mm postreduction . 3 . Step articular &gt; 1mm ( 20 ) 4. radial inclination &lt; 15 ° Patients unstable fracture . Type III open fracture Gustilo Anderson . Bilateral fracture ( acceptable include one doll per patient analysis variable study , always choose wrist dominant hand ) . Fractures associated ipsilateral upper limb affection ( except distal ulnar fracture ) . Fracture serious injury prior ipsilateral wrist . Medical criterion contraindicate surgery . Patients low functional demand , categorized dependent Mackenney , ie , need help go shop require assist support crutch / walker walking . Patients tumor lesion secondary process ( eg osteosarcoma , prostate cancer , breast cancer , multiple myeloma ) , congenital metabolic ( eg osteogenesis imperfecta ) others involve poor prognosis associate disease . Women suspect pregnancy pregnancy participate clinical trial collection monitoring data expect perform radiographic examination , case pregnancy , would contraindicate .</criteria>
