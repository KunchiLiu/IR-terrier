	<brief_summary>Background : Uveitis inflammation eye cause vision loss . It treat medication sometimes surgery . However , many people , treatment always prevent loss vision . A new medication , ustekinumab , reduces inflammation patient inflammatory disease . Therefore , might helpful treatment uveitis . Objective : To see ustekinumab safe help people uveitis . Eligibility : People age 18 old uveitis Design : Participants screen : Medical eye disease history Physical exam Eye exam : The pupil dilate eye drop . A machine scan back eye . Pictures take inside eye . Blood urine test Tuberculosis test Participants 6 clinic visit 28 week . Visits last 2-3 hour include : Medical eye disease history Physical eye exams Blood urine test Fluorescein angiography : A needle guide thin plastic tube arm vein . A dye inject tube . The dye travel vein blood vessel eye . A camera take picture dye flow blood vessel eye . Ustekinumab injection Weeks 0 , 4 , 8 : The injection skin upper arm , leg , abdomen . Participants uveitis monitor receive standard uveitis care study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : Uveitis refers intraocular inflammatory disease important cause visual loss . Standard systemic immunosuppressive medication uveitis cause significant adverse effect many patient continue experience disease flare-up . Ustekinumab human IL-12 -23 antagonist . The involvement IL-12 IL-23 pathophysiology uveitis autoimmune disease know associated uveitis suggest ustekinumab could potential treatment uveitis . The study objective investigate safety , tolerability potential efficacy subcutaneous injection ustekinumab possible treatment active intermediate uveitis , posterior uveitis panuveitis . Study Population : Five participant active intermediate uveitis , posterior uveitis panuveitis meet inclusion criterion initially enrol . Up seven participant may enrol , two participant may accrue account participant withdraw study prior Week 16 . Design : This prospective , non-randomized , uncontrolled , single-center pilot study evaluate subcutaneous injection ustekinumab possible treatment active intermediate uveitis , posterior uveitis panuveitis . Participants receive 90 mg subcutaneous injection ustekinumab baseline second third injection Week 4 8 total 3 injection . Participants continue study total 28 week able receive standard care first 16 week . Outcome Measures : The primary outcome number participant experience treatment response Week 16 . Secondary outcome include change visual acuity , number participant experience recurrence , number day recurrence , presence extent macular edema , amount retino-vascular leakage , change retinal thickening , length time quiescence ability taper concomitant immunosuppressive medication . Safety outcomes include number severity systemic ocular toxicity adverse event , proportion participant experience vision loss great equal 15 letter measure Electronic Visual Acuity ( EVA ) number participant experience substantial rise elevate intraocular pressure ( IOP ) .</detailed_description>
