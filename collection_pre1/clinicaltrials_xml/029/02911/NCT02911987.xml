	<brief_summary>Low back pain common disorder , occur worldwide male female age group . The prevalence high female incidence peak 30 65 year . It currently frequent musculoskeletal cause functional disability major socio-economic impact today 's society . Although small percentage person low back pain diagnose specific underlying cause , almost 90 % person low back pain present symptom nonspecific origin . A part symptoms short duration , 23 % people develop nonspecific chronic low back pain ( NSCLBP ) . Exercise therapy ( ET ) currently important component treatment NSCLBP . Previous study analyse effect various mode exercise therapy , motor control therapy , core stability training aerobic condition training . However , therapy outcomes low , guideline favour use specific program contradictory . It thus still remain unclear therapy modality best suit . Furthermore , recommendation available optimal training intensity rehabilitation person NSCLBP . Since well aerobic muscular deconditioning apparent person chronic low back pain improvement overall physical fitness affect therapy outcomes population , ET specifically focus physical fitness advocate NSCLBP rehabilitation . High Intensity Training ( HIT ) , promote effective efficient train method improve physical fitness health related parameter healthy person . Also , HIT result successful reconditioning improvement functional disease relate outcomes person chronic disease multiple sclerosis , heart failure , COPD cardiometabolic disease . Although study show promising result effect HIT low back pain high intensity isolate , evidence still scarce study result unclear methodological shortcoming . The aim randomize clinical trial study evaluate effect HIT program disease relate outcomes , physical fitness muscle contractile characteristic compare conventional rehabilitation program person NSCLBP .</brief_summary>
