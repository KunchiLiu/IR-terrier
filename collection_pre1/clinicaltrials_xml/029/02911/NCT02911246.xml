	<brief_summary>Malnutrition define energy supply deficit , protein , macro-molecules micro-nutrients , result imbalance nutrient intake metabolic need body . It concern 40 60 % patient upon entry resuscitation influence prognosis . Studies past decade show nutritional deficiency increase morbidity mortality intensive care . Several clinical biological parameter evaluate marker malnutrition , include ratio urea / urine creatinine . The report would identify patient state malnutrition , optimize nutritional care . This set easy obtain patient simple urine collection unlike clinical biological criterion resuscitation malnutrition assessment . This ratio urea / urien creatinine would optimize energy intake critically ill patient , nutritional management method widely debate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Report Urea / Urine Creatinine Marker Nutritional Status Predictive ICU Care Associated Infections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At present , many clinical study show link malnutrition infectious complication intensive care particularly immune disorder . Many study test different nutritional strategy use main criterion infectious complication . So robust standard , well documented literature reflection malnutrition intensive care , also want use study . In pilot study surgical ICU Hotel-Dieu report urea / creatinine urine biomarker poor outcome nutritional status ICU seem extremely discriminate predict existence nosocomial infection . Furthermore kinetics relationship intake 5th day resuscitation , also appear relevant predict occurrence nosocomial infection . Surgical ICU Hotel-Dieu propose conduct multicenter study confirm relationship ratio urea / creatinine urine , malnutrition marker , nosocomial infection ( NI ) intensive care . Primary objective : To evaluate predictability ratio urea / creatinine urinary J5 occurrence nosocomial infection intensive care .</detailed_description>
