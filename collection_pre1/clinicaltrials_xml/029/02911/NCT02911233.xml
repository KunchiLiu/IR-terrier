	<brief_summary>Hemophilia A rare X chromosome-linked recessive bleeding disorder concern one individual 5000 . In severe form , hemophilia A life-threatening , cripple hemorrhagic disease . The treatment bleed episode hemophilia A patient involve administration exogenous human FVIII restore normal hemostasis . The main complication substitutive treatment hemophilia A development , 15 30 % case , anti-FVIII antibody ( FVIII inhibitor ) neutralize pro-coagulant activity therapeutically administer FVIII . In 2003 , average annual cost care patient hemophilia A evaluate equal 63,000 euro ( 2 ) , , France ( 6000 patient ) , represent annual budget 378 million euro . In order reduce cost treatment bypass complication , different therapeutic strategy ( new product adjunctive therapeutic option ) explore , include platelet infusion , tranexamic acid , amino caproic acid , molecule block tissue factor pathway inhibitor , combination phospholipid -Factor Xa- Factor XIII antibody direct Tissue Factor Inhibitor Pathway ( TFPI ) . Recently , Soluble thrombomodulin ( Solulin ) develop . This molecule may use partially correct premature lysis defect Factor VIII deficient plasma activate TAFI - dependent mechanism . With long half-life ( 15- 30-hour ) effective dose range estimate range sub-nanomolar approximately 40nM , Solulin could potentially administer weekly basis provide basis factor-sparing regime would cut cost make therapy widely available . However , proceed advanced trial , safety concern stem anticoagulant property Solulin must address . The development Solulin mutant lack protein C activation capacity would make concern redundant . At time , mutant molecule likely possess effective dose range . Our project compare behavior recombinant Solulin mutant Solulin lack protein C activation capacity respect ability stabilize fibrin clot whole blood human different coagulation factor deficiency ( hemophilia A , hemophilia B rare blood coagulation deficiency ( factor X , VII , V ) .</brief_summary>
