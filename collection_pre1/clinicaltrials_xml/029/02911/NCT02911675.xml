	<brief_summary>Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) lead cause death follow injury civilian population major cause death disability combat casualty . While primary brain injury reverse , management severe TBI focus mitigation secondary injury mechanism occur part downstream effect primary damage brain . Many secondary injury mechanism manifest clinically elevate intracranial pressure ( ICP ) cerebral perfusion pressure ( CCP ) . This level duration elevate ICP strongly associate poor long term patient outcome . Currently , two invasive technique use facility monitor ICP CPP . The first method require placement intra-parenchymal fiberoptic pressure monitor ( IPM ) , also know camino , brain tissue measure display ICP continuously . The second method require placement extracranial ventricular drain ( EVD ) measure ICP close clamped also allow therapeutic drainage cerebral spinal fluid ( CFS ) reduce pressure within skull open . While clinical practice vary greatly across institution , current clinical practice institution use EVD ICP management allow continuous therapeutic CSF drainage manually close drain ICP assessment hourly basis . However , retrospective study TBI patient institution simultaneous IPM EVD placement , spike ICP note correspond clamp EVD often remain elevated 15-30 minute return baseline . Due strong association poor patient outcome elevate ICP , find alarm . These finding important implication procedure treat elevate ICP , also prevent potentially harmful intermittent elevation ICP . Therefore , study seek prospectively investigate association EVD clamping elevate ICP . Specifically , study 2 main objective : 1 . Evaluate need optimize device simultaneously measure intracranial pressure drain CSF without require potentially harmful clamping . 2 . Provide data support retain modify current clinical practice regard intermittent versus continuous monitoring period therapeutic drainage CSF .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Investigators plan single-center , 36 month prospective observational study 50 patient present moderate severe traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center require intracranial pressure monitoring . This interventional device study utilize EVD/IVC IPM/Camino provide evaluate data optimize treatment control elevate ICP CCP patient severe TBI . Enrolled patient randomize one two study group list follow consent process . Once potential participant consent study , use excel random number generator function ( randbetween ( 0,1 ) ) generate random number 0 1 participant . If 0 generate participant place Group 1 ( Hourly EVD closure ) 1 generate , participant place Group 2 ( EVD closure every 12 hour ) . There placebo control group . Standard Care ( 25 patient ) : Standard EVD management therapeutic drainage appropriate hourly EVD ICP measurement simultaneous IPM/Camino ICP measurement collect . Experimental ( 25 patient ) : Therapeutic CSF drainage appropriate , EVD closure ICP assessment every 12 hour simultaneous IPM/Camino ICP measurement collect . Data collect age , mechanism injury , time interval injury MRI , past medical history , admission hemodynamics , admission component GCS , post-resuscitation component GCS , injury severity score , abbreviated injury score head injury , blunt carotid vertebral artery injury , therapeutic intervention . Continuous vital sign streams collect . In addition , available , video surveillance patient 's stay Neurotrauma Critical Care Unit collect stored patient study data .</detailed_description>
