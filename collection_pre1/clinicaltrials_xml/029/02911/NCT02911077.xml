	<brief_summary>Background : Many bacteria live gut . The gut tube move food mouth stomach intestine . Heavy alcohol use disturbs bacteria . There evidence bacteria gut may affect anxiety depression . Researchers want learn bacteria order well treat disease alcohol dependence . Objective : To identify different bacteria live mouth gut . Also , learn bacteria change person go alcohol detoxification . Eligibility : People age 18 older : - Enrolled screen protocol 14-AA-0181 - Are go detoxification treatment Clinical Center Design : Participants physical exam . Participants answer question : - Anxiety depression - Alcohol use - Sleep - Abdominal oral health - Diet Participants keep regular record diet . Participants breath alcohol analysis 4 time per day . Participants provide stool oral specimen day first week . Then , provide week Clinical Center . - For oral specimen : A small brush rub tongue . They may eat , drink , perform oral care within 2 hour collection . - For stool specimen : They receive container fit toilet . They let nurse know right away sample ready . Participants dental visit . This consist oral exam oral health assessment . The dentist may recommend clean dental X-rays .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Longitudinal Changes Oral Gut Microbiome Individuals With Alcohol Dependence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The microbiome exists complex symbiotic relationship human host , characterization imperative understanding myriad disease . Until recently , much gut microbiome research focus gastrointestinal disorder . Recent research , however , implicate gut microbiome psychological disorder well propose gut-brain axis . Of particular interest characterization microbiome individual severe alcohol use disorder , alcohol know profoundly alter gut microbiome . For many year , scientist theorize connection proinflammatory mediator produce ethanol consumption , liver disease gut microbiome . This study represent first instance naturalistic time course change gut microbiome follow alcoholic detailed history alcohol consumption diet obtain . We hypothesize gut microbiome renormalize spontaneously without specific intervention time frame one two week . Alcoholic patient also suffer serious oral hygiene problem associate alteration oral microbial flora . We hypothesize abnormality oral microbiome detectable admission , also rapidly renormalize abstinence resumption ordinary diet oral hygiene . If , finding study could point need intervention , administration probiotic . Twenty evaluable participant admit Clinical Center alcohol detoxification enrol . All patient admit Unit Clinic Evaluation , Screening , Assessment , Management protocol ( 14-AA-0181 ) , include adult 18 year age old seek treatment severe alcohol use disorder . Oral ( tongue brushing ) gut ( stool ) specimens collected daily first week . And week 28 day . Demographic characteristic , detailed drinking dietary history , measure addiction severity , comorbid mental disorder , metabolic indicator disease collect correlation microbiological result . Dietary record include use probiotic . Exclusion criterion include use antibiotic , corticosteroid immunosuppressive agent within past month . Informed consent obtain consent screen treatment protocol ( 14-AA-0181 ) accordance policy protect participant impaired decision-making . Microbial identification include 16S rRNA analysis validate Next Generation Sequencing analysis pipeline . Statistical comparison patient oral gut microbiome sample evaluate result population also compare publish microbiomes healthy volunteer well exist data alcohol dependent individual . Participants compensate research-related discomfort inconvenience accordance NIH guideline .</detailed_description>
