	<brief_summary>As result sustain operation Afghanistan Iraq , increase number U.S. military Veterans substance use disorder comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) . If leave untreated , individual substance use disorder PTSD increase risk develop mental health problem ( e.g. , depression , anxiety ) , suicidal ideation attempt , medical problem , reduce resiliency military readiness , vocational problem , family/social impairment . This study determine benefit N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) treat alcohol use disorder comorbid post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) among military Veterans .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>NAC Treating Comorbid PTSD AUD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As result sustain operation Afghanistan Iraq , increase number U.S. military Veterans substance use disorder comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) . While mental health service place U.S. service member , substantial gap treatment co-occurring substance use disorder PTSD exist little scientific evidence available guide provision care . Treatment comorbid substance use disorder PTSD , especially pharmacologic treatment , largely ineffective short-lived . While numerous study focus largely dopaminergic mechanism reward , lead development adequate treatment comorbid substance use disorder PTSD . Animal model demonstrate ( ) acute stress chronic use addictive substance reduce capacity glia remove neurotransmitter glutamate , ( b ) impairment well relapse prevent reverse N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) . Further , human study indicate NAC associate reduce crave substance use . Based , investigator conduct Proof Principle ( PoP ) study first examine use NAC treatment PTSD , without comorbid addiction . In randomized , control double-blind pilot study investigator show Veterans substance use disorder ( 81.5 % alcohol use disorder ) PTSD treat 2400mg NAC 8 week demonstrate significant reduction PTSD severity crave . Moreover , reduction PTSD substance-related symptomatology sustain 1-month follow-up . However , extend confirm clinical utility military/Veteran context , important know whether NAC reduce severity alcohol use disorder ( AUD ) , common addiction among Veterans military service member , mechanism underlie therapeutic response . Based promise data PoP project , propose Extend-and-Confirm ( EC ) study determine efficacy NAC reduce AUD comorbid PTSD Veterans ( N=90 ) . Further , new aim include application functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( 1H-MRS ) investigate pathophysiology AUD/PTSD , well prognostic indicator treatment outcome . These aim extend Future Plans propose original PoP study provide opportunity collaboration among clinical preclinical investigator Ralph H. Johnson Veterans Affairs ( VA ) Medical Center Medical University South Carolina ( MUSC ) solve critical health problem military context . In propose EC study , investigator ( 1 ) employ randomize , double-blind , between-groups experimental design consist 8 week treatment NAC ( 2400mg ) placebo medication , follow-up assessment 1- , 3- , 6-months post treatment ; ( 2 ) use standardize , repeat dependent measure rigorously ass AUD severity PTSD symptomatology treatment follow-up ; ( 3 ) collect biologic measure alcohol use ; ( 4 ) measure impairment associate area function ( e.g. , depression , sleep , suicidality , risky sexual behavior , family/social functioning ) ; ( 5 ) employ advance neuroimaging technique treatment among subset enrol subject . This proposal directly responsive mission Institute Translational Neuroscience ( ITN ) , US Army/Department Defense ( DoD ) seek accelerate development new , medication-based treatment mitigate impact AUD comorbid psychological condition , PTSD , military/Veteran context . The finding study provide critically need empirical evidence help inform practice guideline well serve need U.S. service member , Veterans family .</detailed_description>
