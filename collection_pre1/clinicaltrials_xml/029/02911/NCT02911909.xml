	<brief_summary>The aim study determine difference post operative rehabilitation anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL ) reconstruction surgery use moderate blood flow therapy vs. standard physical therapy . All patient undergo ACL reconstruction , age 18-30 , consent take part study , meet eligibility criterion , include study . Patients follow two year determine difference muscle strength , thigh circumference , knee range motion , pain , functional activity level , patient satisfaction , level Human growth hormone HGH ) , Insulin-like Growth Factor ( IGF ) , Creatine Kinase ( CK ) , KT2000 , Lachman physical examination .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Moderated Blood Flow Restriction After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>. The study prospective , randomize , control trial two treatment cohort . A total 50 patient enrol study . Informed consent obtain clinic prior surgical intervention , per IRB protocol . Enrollees receive copy consent HIPAA form . All patient meet inclusion criterion consent participate study randomly assign either control group moderate blood flow therapy group . Randomization occur autogenerated permutated 1:1 block randomization use electronic assignment orthopaedic research team prior initiation post-operative therapy . The control group undergo standard care , post-operative ACL reconstruction rehabilitation . The treatment group also receive standard ACL rehabilitation combine Delfi moderate blood flow restriction therapy . Patients follow standard care clinic visit participate standard care physical therapy protocol ACL reconstruction . Baseline measurement thigh circumference , knee ROM , KT 2000 , Lachman exam , labs HGH , IGF , CK obtain preoperatively . Patients also complete preoperative IKDC , Tegner , PROMIS , VAS pain survey . Measurements thigh circumferenceand knee range motion occur 2 week interval post operatively . Strength test begin 5 month post-operatively . These measurement occur standard therapy session . KT 2000 Lachman exam perform 4 , 6 , 8 , 12 month post operatively . A standard functional return sport evaluation perform 4 , 6 , 8 , 12 month postoperative visit . Labs HGH , IGF , CK draw 2 , 6 , 12 , 24 week . VAS pain score record therapy session . The PROMIS , IKDC , Tegner survey give 4 , 6 , 8 , 12 month interval . The study conclude 12 month follow . All post-operative visit standard care . No additional clinic visit require study . Background patient information collect include age , sex , BMI , co-morbidities .</detailed_description>
