	<brief_summary>Background : Primary effusion lymphoma ( PEL ) rare disease standard treatment . Researchers want see drug call lenalidomide along common chemotherapy drug may effective treat PEL . Objective : To test new treatment PEL . Eligibility : People age 18 old PEL . Design : Participants screen blood test , image study , physical exam , test . Participants test evaluate disease . These may include : Blood test Scans Lumbar puncture . Fluid around spinal cord remove needle . Bone marrow remove needle studied Samples skin lymph node remove Fluid remove around organ Lung eye test Tubes camera take picture airways digestive tract Participants take lenalidomide pill 10 day . They keep pill diary . Participants catheter ( small tube ) place large vein arm chest . Participants get DA-EPOCH-R intravenous infusion catheter several day . This repeat 21-day cycle . Most participant 6 cycle . Participants get drug filgrastim injection skin . They get drug methotrexate inject spinal fluid . During study , participant follow test do least : Medical history Physical exam Blood , urine , stool test Lesions photograph measure Lumbar puncture Participants follow-up visit 5 year . They repeat screen test plus urine stool test . Participants may contact later phone see ... .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lenalidomide Combined With Modified DA-EPOCH Rituximab ( EPOCH-R2 ) Primary Effusion Lymphoma KSHV-associated Large Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background - Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus ( KSHV ) -associated primary effusion lymphoma ( PEL ) aggressive B cell neoplasm clinicopathologic molecular profile distinct AIDS-related lymphoma . - There prospective study rare lymphoma . Clinical experience limit ; however , report prognosis poor , median survival estimate less 6 month use conventional CHOP-like chemotherapy . - Novel treatment urgently need KSHV-associated lymphoma , therapeutic approach must take account concurrent KSHV-associated malignancy commonly see patient population - Lenalidomide , immune-modulatory derivative thalidomide ( IMiD drug ) vitro direct antitumor effect KSHV-lymphomas well immune modulatory antiangiogenic effect may beneficial treat PEL - Rituximab , anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody , recently show active agent management KSHV-MCD . Although PEL CD20-negative tumor , advance understand biology KSHV-infection B-cells , pathobiology IL-6 syndromes KSHV-MCD KSHV-NHL , clinical experience use rituximab treatment KSHV-MCD , support use rituximab treatment PEL , especially patient concurrent KSHV-MCD . - Modified dose-adjusted etoposide , prednisone , vincristine , cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin ( DA ) -EPOCH anthracycline-based regimen allow personalization dose-intensity show inclusion etoposide infusional administration decrease tumor cell resistance . - The use DA-EPOCH combination rituximab treatment HIV associate diffuse large B-cell lymphoma Burkitt lymphoma show safe effective . - Given central role control HIV viremia combination antiretroviral therapy ( cART ) management KSHV-associated malignancy , well likely contribution uncontrolled HIV viremia PEL pathogenesis , cART employ important part treatment regimen . Main Objectives Phase I - Evaluate safety tolerability lenalidomide combination DA-EPOCH-R determine maximum tolerate dose and/or recommend phase II dose regimen . Phase II - Evaluate overall survival treatment-naive patient primary effusion lymphoma treat lenalidomide combination , DA-EPOCH rituximab ( DA-EPOCHR2 ) . Eligibility - Adult patient great equal 18 year pathology confirm primary effusion lymphoma , include extracavitary variant , KSHV-associated large cell lymphoma - Lymphoma measurable assessable - Previously treat patient allowed Phase I previously treat modified DA-EPOCH - Any HIV status - Hematologic biochemical parameter within pre-specified limit screen - Willing use effective birth control , define full protocol - Neither pregnant breast feed - Excluded serious co-morbid condition would prohibit administration plan chemotherapeutic intervention present Design - This phase I/ II study lenalidomide combination rituximab modify DAEPOCH ( EPOCH-R2 ) patient PEL KSHV-associated large cell lymphoma - Phase I study evaluate lenalidomide 25 mg day 1-10 combination modify DA-EPOCH-R determine safety tolerability . Dose de-escalation dos lenalidomide 20 mg 15 mg. - Patients HIV generally prescribe cART . - In phase I , 3 dose level , 6-18 patient accrue ( 3-6 patient per level ) . - In phase II portion study , 15 evaluable patient enrol 48-60 month 12 month follow-up last patient enrol , 1-tailed 0.10 alpha level test would 80 % power determine OS curve would demonstrate 1-year OS consistent 45 % good rule 20 % bad .</detailed_description>
