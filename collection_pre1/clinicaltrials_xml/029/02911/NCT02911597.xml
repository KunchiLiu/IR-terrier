	<brief_title>Ketamine Therapy Plus Minus Naltrexone Treatment-Resistant Depression ( TRD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary goal determine antidepressant effect Ketamine mediate opiate mechanism . Primary Objective : To determine opioid property Ketamine responsible 's antidepressant effect potentially block antidepressant effect opioid antagonist naltrexone . We measure objective look response scale call 6- item Hamilton Rating Scale Depression ( HAM-D-6 ) . Response define statistically significant great decrease overall score scale , post infusion . Secondary Objective : This include compare scale call Clinician Administered Dissociative States Scale ( CADSS ) patient group , one group receive Ketamine plus Naltrexone compare group receive Ketamine plus placebeo , determine naltrexone effect CADSS well determine CADSS associate antidepressant response Another secondary objective ass ketamine crave use Visual Analog Craving Scale Ketamine ( VASK ) , infusion determine change level crave group receive naltrexone . Number Subjects : ) 30 ii ) The subject draw outpatient sample patient MDD , diagnose use Structured Clinical Interview DSM-IV Axis I Disorders ( SCID-I/P ) , currently stable , adequate dose antidepressant therapy , define MGH ATRQ , least 4 week history intolerance least 2 antidepressant treatment .</detailed_description>
