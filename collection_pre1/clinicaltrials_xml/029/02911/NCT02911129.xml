	<brief_summary>Background : After stroke , balance two half brain lose . This may cause people lose ability perceive side space . This call neglect . Having people wear prism glass ( call PA ) reduce neglect symptom . Researchers want find PA , whether restores balance brain . Objective : To learn prism adaption temporarily change vision connection brain . Eligibility : People age 18 75 brain damage right side brain stroke cause , lead neglect . Healthy volunteer age 18 75 . Design : Participants 1 3 visit . Participants screen neurological exam . They may also : Tests think vision Tests see eye hand prefer A pregnancy test All participant : Answer question personality , style thinking , belief . Do simple task paper computer Have magnetic resonance imaging . They lie table slide cylinder strong magnetic field . Participants lie still computer task scanner . Participants may also : Transcranial magnetic stimulation . A brief electrical current pass wire coil scalp . This create magnetic pulse affect brain activity . Participants may ask tense certain muscle perform simple action task . PA . They sit front board point dot wear prism glass shift vision leave right .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives : The ability efficiently select information environment relies balance interaction right leave hemisphere . Hemispatial neglect , frequently follow damage right hemisphere , hypothesize result breakdown interhemispheric balance . There evidence transcranial stimulation study breakdown interhemispheric balance reflect fronto-parietal connectivity . The primary goal study test whether alter balance leave right hemisphere , repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) prism adaptation ( PA ) , affect functional connectivity measure functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) . We also explore relationship change functional connectivity behavioral performance . Study population : Healthy adult volunteer patient neglect right hemisphere damage . Design : The study contain three experiment . Experiment 1 design investigate mechanism change induce PA rest state functional connectivity neglect patient healthy volunteer ( two-arm parallel study ) . Experiment 2 design investigate mechanism change rest state functional connectivity induce lPA , rPA , nPA healthy volunteer right dominant eye lPA healthy volunteer leave dominant eye ( four-arm parallel study ) . Experiment 3 design see inhibitory rTMS right posterior parietal cortex ( PPC ) influence functional connectivity visuospatial bias healthy volunteer ( crossover study ) . Outcome measure : For three experiment primary outcome measure change ( difference ) fronto-parietal rest state connectivity post pre PA rTMS procedure . The secondary outcome measure change visual field representation visuo-motor cognitive behavior accompany manipulation .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Inclusion Criteria participant : All participant must neurological examination NINDS physician within last two year , clinical MRI within last year , able read , write speak English . Experiment 2 require 63 healthy volunteer right dominant eye 21 volunteer leave dominant eye . Therefore healthy volunteer leave dominant eye recruit necessary number reach . We estimate screen 150 healthy volunteer . Inclusion Criteria Healthy volunteer : Experiment 1 Age 1875 ( inclusive ; try match stroke group ) Montreal Cognitive Assessment score great equal 26 Absence neglect time test ( Diller test score less equal 2 ) Experiments 2 3 Righthandedness Age 1835 ( inclusive ) Twelve year education Are able see dot size 0.2 inch distance 22.5 inch without glass contact lens ( Experiment 2 ) Inclusion Criteria Patients : Experiment 1 Age 1875 ( inclusive ) Montreal Cognitive Assessment score great equal 26 A right hemisphere stroke focal , nonprogressive , brain lesion result neglect Minimum 30 day lesion onset test Evidence neglect time test ( Diller test score great equal 5 ) EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Exclusion Criteria Healthy volunteer : Significant illness affect central nervous system History seizure ( Experiment 3 ) Inability give inform consent Concurrent use sedate medication Trained write leave right direction Ferromagnetic metal cranial cavity eye , e.g . aneurysm clip , implanted neural stimulator , cochlear implant , ocular foreign body Implanted cardiac pacemaker autodefibrillator pump Nonremovable body pierce Claustrophobia Inability lie supine 1.5 hour Pregnancy Exclusion Criteria Patients : Significant illness affect central nervous system , right hemisphere lesion cause neglect Inability give inform consent Concurrent use sedate medication Ferromagnetic metal cranial cavity eye , e.g . aneurysm clip , implanted neural stimulator , cochlear implant , ocular foreign body Implanted cardiac pacemaker autodefibrillator pump Insulin pump . Nonremovable body pierce Claustrophobia Inability lie supine 1.5 hour Pregnancy</criteria>
