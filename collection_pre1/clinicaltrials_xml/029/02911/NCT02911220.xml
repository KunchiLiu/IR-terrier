	<brief_summary>The intrinsic asthma ( atopic ) particular phenotype mark early later symptom , increased severity , sensitivity associate nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) , sinonasal polyposis eosinophilia . Unlike allergic asthma , form today demonstrate genetic character . However , existence familial form asthma region Pays de La Loire lead u hypothesize existence genetic variation explain familial form non-atopic asthma . Corresponding gene may relevant understand pathophysiological pathway involve common sporadic form . The investigator propose study combine genetic linkage analysis complete sequence exomes identify one genetic abnormality associate non-atopic asthma . The clinical stage essential mutation identification identify recruit large family member affect non-atopic asthma ensure accurate phenotyping individual recruit several generation . The aim study create cohort family member within non-atopic asthma . A high genetic combine exome sequence throughput analysis family linkage study reveal presence absence genetic variation associate intrinsic asthma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients non-atopic asthma identify consultation pulmonology Laennec Hospital ( CHU Nantes ) consultant population severe asthma . These patient treat index case . The investigator conduct family tree index case identify family number healthy individual non-atopic asthma make relevant family genetic study . Before initiate family screening , necessary notion least two individual carry non-atopic asthma least two generation family . Related agree participate study include .</detailed_description>
