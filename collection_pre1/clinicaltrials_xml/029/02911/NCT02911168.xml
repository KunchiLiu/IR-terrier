	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare proximal intercostal block medial ( classic ) ultrasound-guided paravertebral block . The investigator hypothesize proximal intercostal block allow improve needle visualization , short block time , improve safety profile compare classic paravertebral bock .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison US-Guided Paravertebral Proximal Intercostal Nerve Blocks</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although previous study make advance towards apply ultrasound guidance performance paravertebral block ( PVB ) , technique combine safety technical ease remain elusive . The ideal technique ( 1 ) permit continuous visualization entire needle shaft tip , ( 2 ) avoids aim needle tip injectate directly toward neuraxis lung , ( 3 ) easy perform . Visualization structure ultrasound essential minimize risk vascular puncture , nerve root spinal cord injury , pneumothorax . Failure consistently quickly identify transverse process pleura , occur use old technique , result several needle redirections , cause pain discomfort patient , increase potential risk pneumothorax . The technical difficulty apply previously-described US-guided technique take inordinate amount time clinically less practical within busy surgical practice . In current study , investigator describe novel , modify approach real-time ultrasound-guided single shot paravertebral blockade , proximal intercostal block ( PICB ) , utilizes sagittal paramedian US probe placement identify intercostal space PVS . In method , instead place probe fix traditional distance 2.5 cm spinous process , probe move laterally obtain comprehensive image , clear view rib , internal intercostal membrane , parietal pleura . The investigator propose move probe laterally towards proximal intercostal space allow clearer simultaneous visualization pleura needle advance towards PVS , achieve comparable injectate spread , ultimately , similar well clinical result . Such improved visualization reduce number needle pass , increase confidence user , decrease block placement time , improve overall block success . This technique combine advantage lateral approach ( good visualization structure , particular pleura ) advantage medial approach ( in-plane , close , direct neuraxis ) .</detailed_description>
