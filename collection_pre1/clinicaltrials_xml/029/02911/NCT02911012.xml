	<brief_summary>The aim study overcome current limit score system use predict thrombotic ( VTE ) hemorrhagic ( BLD ) risk patient . The main problem score system due high rigidity relate score assign risk item . The presence item assign full score item , without possibility moderate item 's score . The final class risk , patient , sum score select item . The approach use assessment base presence absence certain item sum . Starting score system currently use VTE ( PADUA , CAPRINI , KHORANA ) also BLD ( IMPROVE ) , integrate common item single score system manage risk management algorithms identify different class risk .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The term venous thromboembolism use define thrombotic event within venous system without pulmonary embolism ( PE ) . Deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) still , together PE , possibly result therefrom , one common serious complication may occur specific risk patient . The current diagnostic system allow verify presence , quickly frequently DVT ; moreover , DVT PE promptly diagnose determine underestimation true incidence negative consequence morbidity mortality . The propose system also particularly incisive monitoring recurrence risk thromboembolic disease , currently entrust exclusively biological predictive diagnostics ( d-dimer , etc . ) diagnostic imaging ( ultrasound , angio-ct etc. ) . These monitor methodology often burden excess false positive , case , present always affordable cost health system . The innovative system propose monitoring risk management tool simple repetition assessment . VTE third lead cause cardiovascular death heart attack stroke Italy estimate 100 new case per year per 100,000 inhabitant . The VTE risk criterion currently share scientific community use thrombotic risk table generally accept validate like PADUA , CAPRINI , KHORANA , etc . The score calculate puts patient band risk ( low / medium / high ) indicate number obtain sum detect risk factor . The identification risk level VTE ( low / medium / high ) involve administration therapy ( antiplatelet / anticoagulant ) accord ACCP ( American College Chest Physicians ' 2016 ) . Over past year several score system propose . These system design stratify risk thrombosis patient characterize significant difference . In particular , score system consider risk factor take account others apply patient population present high risk VTE already know . The risk score assessment patient base measurement binary question ( e.g . true false ) use strict criterion analysis physiological variable ; involve possibility incur error evaluation , especially case patient manifest borderline situation real risk situation relative normality . MOSE propose innovative approach identify multi-risk , VTE BLD , take account series variable , situation , current score system ca n't describe . The propose study want test system support physician like DSS ( Decision Support System ) choose best therapy , prevent VTE event , patient . Also , study want evaluate actual role risk factor determine VTE . The system suitable development study bleed risk patient VTE risk study risk ( VTE v BLD ) function time therapy . The study retrospective provide analysis outpatient population general practitioner total 15208 patient . To eligible , patient present doctor 's office consultation relate health disorder meet follow inclusion criterion : age ≥ 18 year , cooperative attitude , signature inform consent form grant permission use personal health data . The identified population assess VTE risk accord risk score PADUA , CAPRINI , KHORANA , IMPROVE BLD risk . The aim study implement predictive system , base fuzzy logic , capable identify patient risk develop VTE event . In first part study presence absence VTE event hidden researcher . After calculate MOSE risk score , result cross patient actually VTE event , result compare score system use study ( PADUA , CAPRINI , KHORANA ) .</detailed_description>
