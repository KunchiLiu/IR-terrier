	<detailed_description>Objective : The primary objective study evaluate concordance T790M mutation plasma test Cobas test platform : Super-ARMS , digital PCR NGS . And assess efficacy AZD9291 monotherapy assessment PFS adult patient advance metastatic NSCLC , receive prior EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) therapy T790M mutation positive detect one four plasma test platform : Cobas/Super-ARMS/ digital PCR/NGS . Study number patient plan : Approximately 250 patient recruited China . Study Design : This open-label , multi-center , real world test treatment study . Target patient population : 250 locally advanced metastatic EGFR mutation positive NSCLC patient progression previous EGFR-TKI recruit . Investigational product ( IP ) , dosage , mode administration : AZD9291 oral , potent , selective , irreversible inhibitor EGFR-TKI sensitise resistance mutation NSCLC significant selectivity margin wild-type EGFR . AZD9291 administer orally one 80 mg tablet day . Duration IP administration : Patients may continue receive AZD9291 long continue show clinical benefit , judge investigator , absence discontinuation criterion . The study close maximum period 24 month last patient enrol . Contingencies make ensure continued drug supply patient still derive benefit AZD9291 time . Study measure : Data collect include patient demographic , information need determine patient eligibility ( include medical history , past current disease characteristic , tumor EGFR mutational status ) , AZD9291 exposure , investigator-reported efficacy ( include tumor response disease progression ) , overall survival ( OS ) , safety ( include serious adverse event [ SAEs ] , adverse event lead dose modification , adverse event special interest [ interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis-like event , QTc prolongation event ] ) . Statistical method : The concordance T790M resistance mutation test Cobas test platform calculate . The sensitivity , specificity , PPV NPV test platform ( Super-ARMS , digital PCR , NGS ) calculate Cobas test reference . The Kappa coefficient calculate measure agreement T790M mutation test Cobas test platform . Descriptive statistic provide variable , appropriate . Continuous variable summarize number observation , mean , standard deviation , median , interquartile range ( Q1 , Q3 ) , minimum , maximum . Categorical variable summarize frequency count percentages category . The 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) calculate appropriate . PFS OS , respectively , summarize use Kaplan-Meier estimate median time event ( progression death ) quartiles together 95 % confidence intervals.The chi-square test use compare sensitivity , specificity , concordance two platform use Cobas reference test exploratory manner .</detailed_description>
