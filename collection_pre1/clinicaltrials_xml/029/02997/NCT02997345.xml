	<detailed_description>Detailed Description Preterm Premature Rupture Membranes ( pProm ) factor 40 % preterm birth . The early pregnancy pProm occur , great potential latency period . Threats pregnancy include placental abruption , umbilical cord prolapse , infection , insufficient pulmonary development , preterm delivery . Management pProm may include immediate delivery , induction , expectant management . It still unclear consider best practice course treatment pProm pregnancy post- delivery care pProm baby Neonatal Intensive Care Units ( NICU ) , well long term outcome pProm survivor . Unfortunately , recent study available review exist often reflect current treatment innovation take place , especially neonatal care . Many study available focus pProm small sample size , well short follow-up post-delivery , result wide range report outcome , especially regard morbidity mortality associate pProm . The pProm registry first kind provide large cohort data study . The purpose registry well understand pregnancy birth impact pProm . This include pProm manage pregnancy pProm neonate care NICU ; identify trend expectant management , detect short term long term outcomes affect .</detailed_description>
