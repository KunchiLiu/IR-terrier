	<brief_summary>This open-label , multicentric , international , phase II trial test aromatase inhibitor combination durvalumab patient CD8+ T cell infiltration ( &gt; 10 % CD8+ T cell tumor ) . The trial include two sequence : The first part treatment consist 4-6 week treatment immune-attractants ; second part , CD8+ patient receive 6 month durvalumab combine exemestane .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Durvalumab Endocrine Therapy ER+/Her2- Breast Cancer After CD8+ Infiltration Effective Immune-Attractant Exposure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study conduct 2 part : Part 1 : lymphocyte attraction . After screen phase , patient receive immune-attractant combine exemestane six week . As immune-attractants add course study , appear subsequent appendix full protocol . Up 4 cohort may test sequentially design 240 evaluable patient treat . The first cohort patient receive tremelimumab ( 3 mg/kg , single infusion ) combine exemestane ( 25 mg daily ) . In cohort , interim analysis perform 30 patient order potentially stop cohort ( le 25 % patient present &gt; 10 % CD8+ cell tumor 3 week ) . If 4 cohort close target number 56 patient part 2 reach , additional patient recruit treated best perform immune-attractant treatment base part I result . From moment 56 patient include part 2 , patient enter part 1 . After three week ( +/- 3 day ) , tumor biopsy do . Patients present &gt; 10 % CD8+ cell tumor 3 week remain eligible included second part trial ( patient present CD8+ T cell 3-weeks biopsy treat investigator 's choice ) . Part 2 : lymphocyte activation ( anti-PD1 treatment ) Four six week immune-attractant start , patient &gt; 10 % CD8+ cell tumor receive durvalumab 1500 mg Q4W ( equivalent 20 mg/kg Q4W ) IV , combine exemestane ( 25 mg daily ) , six month . Part 2 include two step . In first step , include 23 patient . If 2 pathological complete response observe 23 patient , part 2 move step 2 . 33 additional patient include step 2 .</detailed_description>
