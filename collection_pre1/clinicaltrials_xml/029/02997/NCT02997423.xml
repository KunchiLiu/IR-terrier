	<brief_summary>This multi-institutional , consortium-based , non-interventional prospective blind endpoint clinical study determine whether high activity Cytochrome C Oxidase ( CcO ) tumor specimens subject newly diagnose primary GBM associate shorten OS ( primary outcome ) PFS ( secondary outcome ) time .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cytochrome C Oxidase Activity Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme ( GBM )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Biomarker trial design prospectively evaluate hypothesis overall survival ( OS ) time subject newly diagnose primary GBM tumor , treat standard care ( SOC ) , function CcO enzymatic activity tumor ( OS ; time interval date first diagnosis death cause , irrespective post-SOC therapy , assess 24 month accrual ) . In particular , tumor high CcO activity associate short OS time compare tumor low CcO activity . SOC consist post-surgical radiation therapy concurrent Temozolomide follow 12 cycle adjuvant Temozolomide . Additional outcome study relation CcO activity GBM tumor progression free survival time ( PFS ; time interval date diagnosis document disease progression MRI tumor-related death ) , compare prognostic ability CcO activity frequently use biomarkers , namely methylation status O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase ( MGMT ) , OS PFS . Tumor tissue submit participate center measurement CcO/Citrate Synthase ( CS ) , MGMT promoter methylation . The subject agree receive SOC treatment . The therapeutic option time first recurrence discretion treat physician . PFS OS time compare high vs. low CcO activity MGMT methylation status tumor . At time death 24 month s/p enrollment ( whichever come first ) , site PI complete exit form document detail enrollee ' treatment history date ( ) tumor progression .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria PreSurgery : 1 . Willingness ability provide write informed consent comply study protocol judge Physician interview ( NOTE : This could patient 's Neurosurgeon , NeuroOncologist Study Investigator ) . 2 . Age ≥ 21years 3 . Karnofsky Performance Status ( KPS ) ≥ 60 . 4 . Subjects ' plan upfront treatment SOC Radiotherapy Temozolomide ( i.e . TEMODAR ) histologically confirm GBM initial diagnosis 5 . No history malignancy except adequately treat nonmelanoma skin cancer , curatively treated situ cancer cervix , curatively treat solid tumor evidence disease least 5 year . 6 . No serious active infection ( e.g. , wound infection require parenteral antibiotic ) serious underlie medical condition opinion investigator would compromise standard care treatment . 7 . No condition ( e.g. , psychological geographical ) would preclude study compliance . 8 . An MRI consistent primary malignant glioma PostSurgery : 9 . Histologically confirm newly diagnose Primary GBM treatment use World Health Organization ( WHO ) classification criterion ( A local pathology report constitute adequate documentation histology initial study enrollment , however central pathology review require confirm diagnosis GBM final data analysis ) . 10 . Availability tumor tissue representative GBM &gt; 70 mg , snapfrozen within 30 minute resection , 10 minute less room temperature . 11 . All subject must receive maximal safe resection follow standard radiation therapy concomitant Temozolomide take course radiation therapy . 1 . Inability fulfill requirement protocol 2 . Any severe postoperative infection complication may significantly delay initiation brain tumor therapy , condition , opinion investigator , would compromise subject 's ability participate study . 3 . Secondary GBM glioma . 4 . History sensitivity Temozolomide . 5 . Planned upfront treatment antiangiogenic agent target ( vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) pathway include limited bevacizumab , cediranib , vandetanib , sunitinib , pazopanib , aflibercept , sorafenib immunotherapy regimen . 6 .
