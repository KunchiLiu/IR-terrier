	<brief_title>PFA-100 Responsive Effect Energy Drinks Platelet Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two previous study demonstrate increased platelet aggregation 60 minute drink commercially available sugar-free energy drink . These study utilize traditional platelet function study , light transmission aggregometry ( LTA ) , platelet function examine add vary concentration panel agonist platelet . These study technically difficult , time intensive study require specialized laboratory . They relatively non-physiologic mimic platelet response vessel wall damage . Other test well represent reaction vessel wall damage , include PFA-100 , measure platelet aggregation adhesion condition high shear . Overall , PFA-100 less expensive , require less technical skill , less time consume LTA . It utilize bleed disorder demonstrate promise marker thrombophilia . PFA-100 demonstrated sensitivity drug dietary effect . It also show difference closure time sedentary athletic individual PFA-100 use investigate effect energy drink .</detailed_description>
