	<brief_summary>Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) common condition high degree morbidity mortality ( Hyder et al. , 2007 ) . Current treatment paradigm TBI focus mitigate secondary injury maintain cerebral physiology ( Carney et al. , 2016 ) , however , currently approve drug target underlying condition patient suffer TBI ( Bullock et al. , 1999 ) . It increasingly recognise innate inflammatory response TBI may inflict injury ( Lucas et al. , 2006 ) , one prominent mediator inflammation injured brain Interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) receptor pathway ( Allan et al. , 2005 ) . An endogenous antagonist IL-1 , available recombinant form ( IL-1ra , Kineret ) , know safe TBI ( Helmy et al. , 2014 ) . In order fully understand , potentially optimize , effect Kineret , investigator wish conduct dose-response study give three cohort ( n=20 per group ) either placebo ( isotonic saline ) , 1.5g 3.0g active substance administer intravenously double-blind , randomized setting . The concentration previous study show present side-effects ( Singh et al. , 2014 ) . The drug provide within 12 hour trauma . The goal provide dose-response effect cerebral inflammatory response . As secondary goal , investigator assess brain damage measure protein blood cerebrospinal fluid , functional outcome inflammation brain use positron emission tomography .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aim The hypothesis increase dose anti-inflammatory drug recombinant human Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist ( IL-1ra , Kineret ) modulate inflammatory state traumatically injured brain , attenuate injurious process occur follow TBI . Study Design While different dos Anakinra use trial , knowledge constitutes optimize concentration drug . To address limitation , current study dose-response study double blind randomise clinical fashion , use placebo ( n=20 ) , 1.5 g ( `` intermediate dose '' ) ( n=20 ) 3.0 g ( `` high dose '' ) ( n=20 ) Anakinra provide first 48 hour ( drug/placebo administer initially 500 mg infusion bolus later 1g 2.5g infusion 48 hour ) . Thus , total n=60 patient include . Sample-size analysis indicate number patient sufficient detect difference inflammatory response gauge cytokine measurement use cerebral microdialysis . As surrogate marker outcome patient , several protein biomarkers brain injury protein innate immune response quantify use technique call ELISA multiplex assay technology . The investigator also wish use radiological technique , magnetic resonance imaging study damage white matter tract brain positron emission tomography ass degree microglial activation . All method use assess potential benefit treatment v placebo . By type study design , minimize bias confounders may influence study . Patient Recruitment Patients clinical diagnosis severe moderate TBI identify research team daily departmental neuro-critical care unit meeting . Patients meet inclusion criterion approach consent/assent conscious next kin present . If , consent assume know Anakinra safe likely narrow therapeutic window . With current patient load Addenbrooke 's Hospital , Cambridge , investigator deem possible recruit one patient per week , thus estimate recruit phase take approximately two year complete . Sampling All sampling conduct acute phase patient unconscious neuro-critical care unit . Microdialysis probe sample hourly . To assess inflammatory activity brain , positron emission tomography perform within first week 2-3 week . Magnetic resonance imaging perform first 2-3 week 6 month . To measure patient 's adaptive immune response brain specific protein , specialise auto-immunisation assay perform patient blood day 1-3 follow injury well 2-3 week . During intensive care phase , blood cerebrospinal fluid sample twice per day ( approximately 3mL per sample time per compartment , volume deem harmful patient ) collect together hourly microdialysate fluid sample first 7 day admission . Blood also sample outpatient clinic follow 6 12 month follow injury . Patient sample anonymised store -80degC Division Neurosurgery , Department Clinical Neurosciences , University Cambridge analysis . It possible measure cytokine , drug biomarkers microdialysis sample due volume constraint . Moreover , believe temporal resolution 6 hour probably adequate brain concentration drug 12 hour sufficient serum . APP tau also measure every 6 hour . The parameter hourly analyse microdialysis cytokine chemokines luminex panel . Clinical Follow-up Patients follow clinic visit 6 12 month trauma questionnaire survey use standardised outcome measure neurosurgical patient include golden standard extend Glasgow Outcome Score Short Form 36 .</detailed_description>
