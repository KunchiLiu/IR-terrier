	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study well combination chemotherapy , bevacizumab , and/or atezolizumab work treat patient microsatellite instability-high colorectal cancer spread place body . Drugs use chemotherapy , fluorouracil , oxaliplatin , leucovorin calcium , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab atezolizumab , may interfere ability tumor cell grow spread .

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine efficacy , base progression-free survival ( PFS ) , fluorouracil , oxaliplatin , leucovorin calcium ( mFOLFOX6 ) /bevacizumab plus atezolizumab ( combination ) atezolizumab ( single agent ) compare mFOLFOX6/bevacizumab ( control ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare overall survival ( OS ) . II . To compare objective response rate ( ORR ) per RECIST 1.1 . III . To determine safety profile combination mFOLFOX6/bevacizumab/atezolizumab atezolizumab monotherapy patient microsatellite instability-high metastatic colorectal cancer ( MSI-H mCRC ) . IV . To compare surgical conversion rate . V. To compare disease control rate ( complete response [ CR ] + partial response [ PR ] + stable disease [ SD ] ) 12 month . VI . To determine duration response stable disease . VII . To compare health-related quality life symptom burden . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To bank tissue blood sample future correlative study patient enrol study . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 3 arm . ARM I : Patients receive bevacizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30-90 minute day 1 , oxaliplatin IV 2 hour day 1 course 1-10 , leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour day 1 , fluorouracil IV 46-48 hour day 1 2 . Courses repeat every 2 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive atezolizumab IV 30-60 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 2 week 48 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM III : Patients receive atezolizumab IV 30-60 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 2 week 48 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients also receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 , oxaliplatin IV 2 hour day 1 course 1-10 , leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour day 1 , fluorouracil IV 46-48 hour day 1 . Courses repeat every absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
