	<brief_summary>There many treatment improve long well people live heart failure outside hospital . However , investigator know less effectively treat hospitalized heart failure patient return hospital go home . Part problem investigator n't understand cause worsen heart failure . Previous study researcher suggest white blood cell call monocyte over-active heart failure . Under normal condition monocyte help fight infection body , over-active monocyte release chemical could cause abnormal function heart blood vessel . The investigator ' research group believe over-active monocyte may important reason heart failure worsen hospitalization . In study investigator collect blood sample day patient come hospital , day return home , day come back clinic follow-up appointment . The investigator measure inflammation bloodstream activity monocytes patient ' blood see change measurement heart failure improve . The investigator also call patient several time return home ask question .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>With 5 million Americans heart failure ( HF ) today incidence approach 10 per 1000 population among person age 65 , HF major source morbidity mortality significant public health concern face develop nation . In US , decompensated heart failure common reason hospital admission among person old 65 . Yet despite significant advance treatment chronic heart failure , currently evidence-based strategy treat acutely decompensated heart failure . The incidence heart failure likely continue rise increase prevalence HF risk factor ( advanced age , hypertension , obesity , diabetes , metabolic disease ) . Accordingly , substantial effort underway identify treat population risk understand molecular driver heterogeneous disease . The investigator understand pathophysiology heart failure evolve 'cardiocentric ' view focus mechanical dysfunction global view . Heart failure understood complex blend structural , functional , neurohormonal abnormality manifest locally systemically . More recently , several group demonstrate abnormality inflammatory cascade associate initiation progression heart failure . The innate immune system appear modulate inflammatory component HF several mechanism include production inflammatory cytokine ( tumor necrosis factor-α , TNFα ; interleukin-6 , IL6 ) , reactive oxygen specie , activation complement system , well functional modification endothelial cell myeloid cell trafficking . Monocytes macrophage two key myeloid mediator acute chronic inflammatory response . Myeloid dysregulation implicate pathogenesis diverse diseases include diabetes , tumor metastasis , pulmonary fibrosis , myocardial infarction , atherosclerosis . Accumulating evidence suggest myeloid subset distinct functional property reflect polarization pattern interaction local microenvironment . As framework study role model clinical disease , myeloid population broadly categorize `` inflammatory '' `` anti-inflammatory '' base specific surface marker , cytokine potential , functional property . Although role myeloid population inflammatory disease appreciate , molecular mechanism link cell clinical heart failure syndromes remain largely unknown . The investigator hypothesize distinct myeloid subset drive different phase acute chronic heart failure syndrome , identification subset functional property provide insight pathophysiology clinical heart failure . In order initially characterize role monocyte play across spectrum heart failure , investigator obtain whole-blood sample acutely decompensated patient date hospitalization , date transfer intensive care unit ( ICU ) general-care telemetry floor ( relevant ) , date hospital discharge , first outpatient follow-up visit . Subjects recruit University Michigan inpatient heart failure service , admit approximately 75 patient decompensated heart failure month . Once sample obtain , investigator perform flow cytometry characterize monocyte subset flux response treatment . The investigator also look production reactive oxygen specie monocytes examine cytokine chemokines skew monocyte population subset gene expression profile . The investigator also investigate energetic state flux ( aerobic vs. anaerobic metabolic status ) monocytes .</detailed_description>
