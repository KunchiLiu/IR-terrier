	<detailed_description>Study Design : This open-label , single centre , prospective , cohort study assess effect algorithmic , echocardiography-guided optimisation CRT-D follow implantation leave ventricular quadripolar lead . Introduction background : There considerable evidence cardiac resynchronisation therapy ( CRT ) improve outcomes symptoms patient heart failure . However , around third patient demonstrate haemodynamic functional benefit follow device implantation . Earlier study use cut-off 15 % reduction leave ventricular end-systolic volume define response CRT . Failure respond CRT felt multifactorial . Issues include : - Anatomical limitation term lead placement ( lead must place within branch coronary sinus vein therefore target site maximum contraction delay difficult ) - Presence area scar tissue , resistant pace - Phrenic nerve stimulation pace site . The phrenic nerve run close heart may stimulate pacemaker , effect patient 's diaphragm stimulate experience persistent hiccup . - High pacing threshold , mean increase power pacemaker must use create successful pace stimulus ( capture ) instance , capture may achieve . This due scar poor contact heart tissue . Previous work demonstrate response improved patient optimisation inter- intra-ventricular dyssynchrony atrio-ventricular delay . However , optimisation limit fixed location lead implantation , pace possible lead tip . Multi-site pacing ( MSP ) quadripolar leave ventricular lead introduce increase number conformation available programmer especially useful reduce phrenic nerve capture . Additionally , multiple vector program sequentially simultaneously , allow incorporation great number myocardial segment . Quadripolar leave ventricular lead routinely use many hospital . They offer new opportunity optimise CRT-D ( resynchronisation-defibrillator ) device alter pace vector four different pole lead two defibrillator coil give hundred possible pacing combination . Several recent study publish look effect multi-site pacing effectiveness CRT therapy . Generally employ limited vector combination , already demonstrate beneficial effect haemodynamics echocardiographic measure heart function . The evaluation algorithm examine many vector combination , include combination right ventricular defibrillator coil , perform . The researcher propose investigate method optimisation . A gold standard optimisation CRT yet define . Methods employ predominantly include invasive haemodynamic measurement echocardiography . The ideal method would low inter-observer variability , high ease use rapid sample rate allow adjustment make evaluated quickly . USCOM , continuous-wave Doppler method continually assess cardiac output , successfully use optimisation CRT gain patent , however far used optimise atrio-ventricular delay . This method may prove accurate , rapid convenient way rapidly assess response change pacemaker parameter . The investigator plan evaluate three method assessment correlate cardiovascular outcome . Hypothesis : Use algorithm optimisation cardiac resynchronisation therapy system contain quadripolar leave ventricular lead dual coil right ventricular lead increase response rate therapy . Study structure : Patients recruit consecutively amongst undergoing implantation CRT-D device . At baseline , undergo assessment functional capacity echocardiographic parameter well invasive leave ventricular pressure monitoring . The device implant normal laboratory condition , aim postero-lateral lateral cardiac vein leave ventricular lead position . Algorithmic echocardiography-guided optimisation device conduct time device implantation . Further assessment conduct simultaneously haemodynamic leave ventricular pressure monitor Ultrasound Cardiac Output Monitoring ( USCOM ) device optimisation . The device program standard CRT parameter . Subjects see 12 week echocardiographic functional assessment , follow algorithmic optimisation repeat haemodynamic echocardiographic monitoring concurrently . Further assessment perform 24 week per baseline , follow study end . Study population : 24 men woman , 18 year old , able attend follow-up assessment 12 24 week implantation .</detailed_description>
