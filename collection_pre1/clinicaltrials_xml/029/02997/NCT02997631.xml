	<brief_summary>Intravenous ( IV ) insertion one common procedures child seek medical treatment Emergency Department ( ED ) . This procedure often painful distress child family . This result uncooperative child , need multiple cannulation attempt , needle phobia , dissatisfaction care family healthcare worker . Non-pharmacological treatment emerge newly favour adjunct pharmacotherapy , distraction therapy . Distraction therapy involve engage child cognitive task order divert attention painful stimuli reduce pain distress . Currently , distraction therapy utilized standard care ED . Given child 's enthusiasm technological device , propose use technologically enhanced device may effective distractor may great impact pain reduction outcomes patient importance . The primary objective study compare reduction pain distress use distraction ( via MEDi robot ) versus current standard care child age 6 11 year undergoing IV placement .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Setting Study Period : This study randomize control trial conduct Emergency Department Stollery Children 's Hospital ( SCH ) . The SCH tertiary care hospital Edmonton , Alberta whose annual ED census &gt; 50,000 child . Based team 's previous successful work field,12 month patient recruitment anticipate , project occur February 2017 January 2018 . Study Population : The study include child age 6-11 year attend SCH ED , require IV placement . See Eligibility section detail inclusion/ exclusion criterion . We plan recruit 80 patient , overall . Recruitment : Research Assistants ( RAs ) shift approximately 15:00 23:00 seven day week . This time correspond peak visit require IV placement base data collect previous study conduct SCH ED . RAs identify approach patient age 6-11 year require IV placement . Inclusion/ exclusion criterion assess , child eligible , RA explain study invite parent child participate . After obtain write , informed consent parent ( assent child , applicable ) , RA randomize patient one two study arm begin data collection . The RA ask one parent/ caregiver child participate complete relevant questionnaire . Study Assessments : After consent/ assent obtain , RA collect information parent baseline demographic variable ( ex . age , gender ) , present sign symptom ( ex . chief complaint ) , well previous history ED visit IV placement . Before procedure , RA bring MEDi ( Medicine Engineering Designing intelligence ) robot room child distraction group , set , explain interact . The staff nurse perform routine set IV placement . Pain measure use child 's self-reported score Faces Pain Scale Revised ( FPS-R ) . These score collect immediately IV placement occur . The child 's response behavior pain assessed use Observational Scale Behavioral Distress ( OSBD ) . The procedure child video-taped IV insertion complete OSBD scoring . Parental anxiety measure pre post procedure State Trait Anxiety Inventory - State Scale Revised Version ( STAI-S , Form Y ) . The degree child 's engagement robot measure immediately follow procedure Intrinsic Motivation Inventory ( IMI ) . Additionally , vitals collect pre , post procedure . Data enter real-time secure online database host REDCap ( Research Electronic Data Capture ) . Randomization , Allocation Blinding Study Treatment : Randomization determine use secure online randomization tool , REDCap , host via Clinical Research Informatics Core University Alberta . A trained RA obtain computer-generated randomized assignment child parent consent/assent obtain . Allocation conceal research staff , ED staff , participant consent randomization assign computer . Due nature intervention , possible blind child , parent , RAs , ED staff . The child parent inform study evaluate different form distraction know study hypothesis MEDi robot . The data analyst blind treatment assignment use randomization code identify group analysis complete . Study Intervention Comparison : The intervention use MEDi robot . The robot child 's eye level , program introduce , interact child , make encouraging comment brave he/she . The duration action coincide length procedure ( approximately 5-8 minute ) . The control group receive standard care , generally include use topical anesthetic cream . This comparison base pragmatic preference physicians Stollery Children 's Hospital well precedent literature.Overall , felt new intervention ( e.g. , MEDi robot ) compare currently practice ( i.e. , standard care ) , single distraction therapy consistently routinely employed EDs time .</detailed_description>
