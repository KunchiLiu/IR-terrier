	<brief_title>Impact Different Educational Approaches Post-operative Opiate Utilization After Elective Lower Extremity Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis : The primary hypothesis educational intervention provide prior surgery prior prescription , result great understanding awareness deleterious effect long-term use opioid base medication , turn reduce utilization post-operatively long-term ( 6 month ) . Specific Aim 1 : Evaluate prescription opioid medication use 6-month period surgery subject receive education compare receive usual care education . Specific Aim 2 : Compare change self-reported outcome measure ( pain , disability , sleep ) group 6-month period surgery . Specific Aim 3 : Describe sociodemographic factor healthcare utilization enrol subject 12 month lead surgical procedure . Identify factor could account difference opioid medication utilization , potential interaction effect intervention , opioid use , clinical outcome follow surgery . Study Procedures/Research Interventions : Subjects randomize either receive usual care usual care plus education video . Usual care define typical information surgeon would otherwise provide patient surgery . All patient receive usual care education surgeon . Randomization : Subjects randomize one two arm ( Group I = Educational Video , Group II= Usual Care Only ) . The method group assignment sequentially numbered opaque seal envelope ( SNOSE ) . To minimize risk predict treatment assignment next eligible patient , randomization perform permuted block two four random variation block number . All Subjects : All subject receive usual care education typically give surgeon . That leave discretion surgeon . The screening enrollment take 5-10 minute , fill self-report questionnaire take approximately 5-7 minute . Subjects group randomize education take additional 11 minute view educational content . All patient proceed surgical procedure plan . Each week 1-month period surgery , patient contact ( phone call , email , text message - depend consent ) . At 1-month 6-month time point ask fill additional clinical outcome measure detail . These do person visit clinic telephone . Sample Size Estimation . Collection healthcare utilization occur 100 % subject follow-up require , therefore opportunity collect data follow-up visit lose . A sample 120 subject allow u determine significant difference group , base moderate effect size 0.6 .</detailed_description>
