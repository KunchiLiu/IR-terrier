	<brief_summary>Rupture abdominal aortic aneurysm ( AAA ) cause 12,000 deaths/year UK.1 Elective repair prevent carry perioperative mortality 4.5 % open surgery 1 % endovascular repair . This risk associate poor cardiorespiratory fitness measure use Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing ( CPET ) CPET variable , peak oxygen uptake ( peakVO2 ) &lt; 15ml/kg/min anaerobic threshold ( AT ) &lt; 10.2ml/kg/min identifying patient increase risk early death AAA repair.3 These variable therefore use surrogate marker cardiovascular fitness risk mortality morbidity AAA surgery ; optimise marker improve fitness decrease risk . The optimal duration type exercise training improve peak VO2 AT AAA patient know . AAA patient unique motivate reduce risk impend surgery afford time improve fitness repair may need month even year . The investigator propose pilot randomise control trial explore effectiveness 20-week community ( either home gym-based ) exercise programme achieve sustain improvement peak VO2 AT , measure CPET , AAA patient . Changes QoL , habitual activity level cardiovascular risk also assess . The result inform definitive multicentre clinical trial exercise improve outcome elderly patient cardiovascular disease AAA .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Men AAA ≥ 3.0 &lt; 5.0 cm woman AAA ≥ 3.0 &lt; 4.5 cm 2 . Aged 60 85 year inclusive 3 . Willing able engage gym and/or homebased exercise training undertake CPET 1 . Unable unwilling undertake CPET exercise training Patients unwilling able give inform consent unable would able randomise intervention study group undergo satisfactory test obtain outcome measure . 2 . High level habitual physical activity ( score `` high '' PASE questionnaire ) These patient already high level physical activity therefore may possible improve fitness primary objective study . Exclusion criteria 310 base medical condition would mean either exercise training may unsafe , would require investigation treatment medical condition likely need upcoming intervention medical condition would take priority participation research study . If medical condition discover study , patient withdraw study refer necessary health professional . 3 . Severe liver disease ( INR &gt; 2 , serum albumin &lt; 3.0g/dL , bilirubin &gt; 50µmol/L ) 4 . Unstable angina , angina &lt; 2 month 's duration , occur twice daily , angina increase frequency precipitate less exertion , angina rest 5 . Uncontrolled atrial fibrillation ( AF ) arrhythmia : untreated paroxysmal AF 6 . Moderate severe aortic valve stenosis ( peak systolic pressure gradient &gt; 40mmHg aortic valve area &lt; 1cm2 ) 7 . Class II/III/IV heart failure and/or leave ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 25 % 8 . Pericarditis myocarditis within last six month 9 . Patients &gt; 2mm ST depression exercise ECG eligible take part refer cardiologist assessment . 10 . Diagnosis treatment malignancy previous 12 month</criteria>
