	<brief_title>COEBICS : Comparison Erythema Between Interrupted Continuous Sutures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose : This randomize , control , prospective split-scar study employ computer-assisted image process establish whether simple interrupted run suture cause great degree erythema surgical scar result Moh 's micrographic surgery ( MMS ) , good understand evolution ( include progression subsequent regression ) erythema time scar . Hypothesis : Based literature review clinical experience investigator , hypothesize quantified difference persist erythema cause suture technique minimal statistically significant . Justification : The cosmetic appearance scar important concern patient undergo Moh 's micrographic surgery ( MMS ) , specialize therapeutic procedure use high risk skin cancer face . Many factor influence aesthetic surgical scar ; suture technique among significant . Simple interrupted stitch run ( continuous ) stitch two frequently use suture technique . Anecdotal opinion favor one technique . Some author consider simple interrupted stitch time consume allows precise wound approximation . Other surgeon feel run stitch decrease suture mark . A recent literature search look influence suture technique cosmetic outcome scar could draw conclusion stitch method recommend facial repair lack comparative study . The need prospective randomize trial field require . Multiple scale report literature utilized cosmetic assessment heal surgical scar . Persistent scar erythema/dilated peri-scar telangiectasias relatively common find associated facial surgery include component one aforementioned scar evaluation scale . Furthermore , presence erythema gauge scale , intensity area parameter would challenge objectively assess . To address issue , investigator develop software capable quantify intensity area involve erythema scar . As , study design determine whether simple interrupted running suture would cause great degree erythema extent ( term intensity area ) result facial MMS scar . Objectives : 1 . To determine whether simple interrupted run suture cause great degree persistent erythema scar result MMS facial defect repair . 2 . To determine percentage difference degree persist erythema ( include intensity area ) cause suture technique . 3 . To quantitatively assess evolution erythema time simple interrupted running suture well characterize pattern progression subsequent regression . Research Design : Prospective randomize control split-scar study . Research Methods : Subjects recruit Dermatologic Surgery Centre VGH Skin Care Centre . They offer option participate study prior begin MMS procedure . All patients/accompanying family member adequate time read protocol consent document prior enter surgical area . All surgery perform experienced dermatologic surgeon and/or MMS Fellow . The procedure follow patient . After ensure length scar &gt; 4cm , patient randomize ( use computer generate sealed envelope method ) epidermal suture technique . Depending randomization , either superior/medial inferior/lateral half scar suture run stitch , whereas half close interrupted stitch . All aspect procedure , include post-operative wound care follow-up , similar patient study . The subject see follow 1 week , 8 week , 6 month follow procedure , regularly schedule patient undergo MMS part ongoing oncologic evaluation wound care . No additional follow appointment schedule specifically purpose study . During follow appointment , close-up photograph scar take use preset aperture ( 14 ) , shutter speed ( 1/60 second ) , flash setting ( +1/3 exposure compensation ) Canon EOS Digital Rebel XT , CanonMR-14EX ring flash , Canon EFS 60mmf/2.8 macro lens . All photograph take follow-up room closely match light parameter camera angle . Following final reassessment 6 month , interval photo process use customize software quantify intensity area erythema visit . Statistical analysis : Power calculation perform . To detect difference 10 % degree erythema two study arm , power 80 % , 100 patient recruit . The two study arm pair since patient 's scar split two part . Subsequently , comparative pair t-tests perform software-generated value erythema intensity area simple interrupt run suture interval MMS scar photograph .</detailed_description>
