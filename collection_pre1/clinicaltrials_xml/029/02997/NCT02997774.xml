	<brief_summary>Having hemodialysis affect blood supply various organ body include heart brain . With time , effect build affect way organ function . The investigator previously show liver ( key organ work help clean blood , make protein turn food energy ) also affect . One way help protect organ injury due dialysis cool dialysis . The investigator want examine whether cool dialysis protects blood supply liver . CT image use measure blood supply hemodialysis standard cooler setting .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cooler Dialysis Liver Perfusion Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hemodialysis exert significant hemodynamic effect widespread consequence vulnerable vascular bed . Cardiac injury , include myocardial stunning subclinical myocardial ischemia , appear common associate significantly increase mortality . The liver show preserve blood flow due dual blood supply . Even , liver excretory function decrease endotoxin level blood increase hemodialysis . Extracorporeal cool dialysis associate protective effect brain heart dialysis patient . The effect cooler dialysis liver perfusion , function endotoxemia hemodialysis unknown . The investigator therefore propose use CT perfusion image examine effect cool hemodialysis liver perfusion , relate effect endotoxin translocation myocardial dysfunction . Additionally , intend investigate potential effect hepatic function context , examine relationship liver perfusion endotoxemia , metabolism uremic toxin clinical symptom uremia . This prospective randomize cross-over study involve single center recruit patient prevalent dialysis population London Health Sciences Centre ( LHSC ) Renal Program . Once recruit , patient undergo two study hemodialysis session - one use standard dialysate temperature 36.5 degree Celsius ( HD36.5 ) one use cooler dialysate temperature 35 degree Celsius ( HD35 ) . The order two session randomly allocate . Before , session , participant undergo cardiac hepatic assessment . This include CT scan , 2D echocardiography indocyanine green ( ICG ) clearance measurement . In addition , participant answer number questionnaire uremic symptom blood test also do . The investigator ' aim characterize compare liver function perfusion hemodialysis , standard cooler dialysate temperature .</detailed_description>
