	<brief_title>Study Tocilizumab Patients With Hepatocellular Carcinoma ( HCC ) Undergoing Transarterial Chemoembolization ( TACE )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TACE ( Transarterial Chemo Embolization ) show improve overall survival compare non-treated patient intermediate HCC ( Hepatocellular Carcinoma ) tumor . However , TACE consider curative strategy eventual local recurrence observe nearly ( &gt; 95 % ) case . Therefore , significant clinical equipoise exist large group HCC patient novel therapy test adjuvant manner TACE . Based pre-clinical data HCC increase identification IL-6 signal lead tumor progression local recurrence solid malignancy , significant rationale exists use Tocilizumab , IL-6 receptor inhibitor adjuvant TACE . While Tocilizumab demonstrate safe RA patient FDA approve , limit data exists maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) patient cirrhosis HCC . Therefore , lead phase IB study design plan identify MTD Tocilizumab HCC patient follow expansion phase II component whereupon primary objective median progression free survival ( PFS ) .</detailed_description>
