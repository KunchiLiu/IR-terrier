	<detailed_description>MERLIN adaptive , single arm , multi-centre , phase IIa multi-disease clinical trial . It design : ) Determine dose safety ORBCEL-C ( select Mesenchymal stromal cell derive human umbilical cord ) ii ) Evaluate treatment activity assessment biomarkers This trial two main stage : - Stage 1 determine maximum tolerate dose administer observe occurrence dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) . - Stage 2 use maximum tolerate dose find stage 1 determine safety activity outcomes ORBCEL-C . Upon completion trial hope able justify conduct separate , large scale trial use ORBCEL-C . OBJECTIVES For Both PSC AIH patient The primary objective Stage 1 : • To determine maximum tolerated single intravenous infusion dose ORBCEL-C 14-day reporting period take forward Stage 2 clinical trial ( study ) . All patient recruit complete 14-day reporting period stage 1 continue evaluate outcome per Stage 2 . The primary objective Stage 2 investigate whether single intravenous infusion ORBCEL-C patient PSC AIH : • Is safe tolerated period trial follow ( 56 day ) For PSC patient • Reduces serum alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) patient PSC . This non-invasive biochemical surrogate clinical outcome PSC For AIH patient • Reduces serum alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) patient AIH . This non-invasive biochemical surrogate marker hepatic inflammatory activity outcomes AIH . The secondary objective Stage 2 investigate whether single intravenous infusion ORBCEL-C elicit change duration study treatment patient PSC AIH : - Liver biochemistry function , immunoglobulin G concentration ( AIH patient ) composite risk score - Non-invasive clinical marker fibrosis - Patient quality life ( QoL ) - Severity co-existent IBD patient PSC . Further exploratory research objectives trial determine whether MSC infusion modulates immune response measure whether treatment elicits change patient PSC AIH : - Markers immune activation include immunoglobulin value C-reactive protein concentration - Markers biliary injury include total bile acid level - Circulating inflammatory cell profile include phenotypic expression T regulatory cell ( Tregs ) common mechanistic primary endpoint - Endothelial cell activation marker VAP-1 ICAM1 - Serum cytokine , chemokine , microRNA RNA expression profile</detailed_description>
