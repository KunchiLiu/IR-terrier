Beginning week 2 , identify treatment non-responders ( lose average 0.5 lbs/week ) re-randomized one two augmentation tactic : 1 ) Modest Step-up , operationalized addition additional mHealth component , 2 ) Vigorous Step-up , operationalized addition additional mHealth component plus traditional weight loss intervention component . Treatment responder continue first-line treatment . Treatment response re-assessed week 4 8 . Those identified treatment non-responders re-randomized time .</detailed_description>
