	<brief_summary>The prognosis patient locally advance SCCHN poor . Results recent randomized trial evaluate induction chemotherapy docetaxel , cisplatin , 5 fluorouracil conflicting , benefit overall survival uncertain . Improve efficacy induction chemotherapy important without increase toxicity . Durvalumab promising agent SSCHN . The safety combination docetaxel , cisplatin , 5 fluorouracil durvalumab unknown . The aim study evaluate feasibility safety association DCF ( standard regimen induction SSCCHN ) durvalumab . The safety profile DCF durvalumab different , expect toxicity additive . The addition durvalumab DCF could improve efficacy induction chemotherapy prognostic patient SSCCHN . Concerning translational research , aim explore relationship immune capacity , specificity , activation state clinical outcome help elucidate determinant response immunotherapy .</brief_summary>
