	<brief_summary>Conventional vascular image technique often either contra-indicated chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) patient due relative invasiveness , risk cost . Computed tomography angiography ( CTA ) require radiation nephrotoxic iodinate contrast may precipitate significant worsen renal function even prompt need institution dialysis . Magnetic resonance angiography ( MRA ) use gadolinium-based contrast agent associate rare disease nephrogenic systemic fibrosis . Alternative imaging method also drawback : example , frail patient group high risk complication conventional invasive catheter-based angiography , non-contrast-enhanced MRA allow visualization small artery less accurate large vascular structure , ultrasound often appropriate evaluation deep vessel abdomen pelvis . Ferumoxytol ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide particle encapsulate semisynthetic carbohydrate , initially develop magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) contrast agent 2000 . However , interest ferumoxytol therapeutic agent treatment iron deficiency anaemia set CKD eclipse use MRI contrast agent . During last decade , ferumoxytol gain appeal MRI contrast agent patient estimate glomerular filtration rate &lt; 30mL/min report literature safe use utility adult pediatric patient CKD . Participants select referred assessment prior kidney transplant prior vascular access creation haemodialysis divide three group . The first group include patient undergo CTA abdominal aortoiliac vasculature part preparation potential kidney transplantation . The second third group include patient fistula graft create dialysis , respectively . These patient routinely US vascular mapping visualise blood vessel fistula graft create . Additionally , patient include second third group routinely surveillance scan fistula graft 6 week follow creation . Study participant undergo standard imaging test part clinical care also ferumoxytol-enhanced MRA ( FeMRA ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This comparative study cohort patient significant renal impairment . Study participant undergo standard imaging test part clinical care also FeMRA . The investigator compare outcomes interest include quality image diagnostic accuracy head-to-head design . These hypothesis test : 1 . FeMRA superior CTA characterisation abdominal aortoiliac anatomy ( pre-transplant assessment ) implantation kidney graft robustly evaluate arterial venous anatomy . 2 . FeMRA superior Doppler US characterisation vascular anatomy ( vascular mapping ) vascular access creation robustly assess central vein patency . 3 . FeMRA superior Doppler US characterisation fistula ( graft ) arm vascular anatomy ( surveillance ) 6 week fistula creation . 4 . Integrated cardiac vascular assessment use FeMRA vascular access creation well predict outcome . Patients select referred assessment prior kidney transplant prior vascular access creation haemodialysis divide 3 different group . The first group ( group A ) include patient CTA abdominal aortoiliac vasculature perform pre-transplant assessment . The two group include patient US vascular mapping perform arteriovenous fistula ( group B ) synthetic graft ( group C ) creation haemodialysis . These patient routinely US Doppler fistula arm 6 week follow access creation surveillance . FeMRA perform addition standard care , i.e . patient group A single FeMRA baseline patient group B C FeMRA baseline second one 6 week . All patient undergo Cardiac MR Ferumoxytol time . This ass whether cardiac parameter transplantation access creation associate outcome ( baseline Cardiac MR ) . The 6-weeks Cardiac MR aim ass cardiovascular functional parameter ( blood flow , cardiac output , systolic diastolic function ) vascular access creation . Imaging perform 3T Prisma ( Siemens ) MRI system . A total dose 3mg Ferumoxytol/kg patient weight deliver exceed one vial ( 510mg ) . In case Ferumoxytol dilute concentration great 1 part Ferumoxytol 4 part 0.9 % sodium chloride administer several spaced infusion dilute agent different image component . Ferumoxytol infusion control sophisticated MRI compatible infusion pump precise control infusion rate . This procedure would take minimum 20 minute full cumulative dose administer usual size patient even longer maximum expect dose 510 mg large patient . As investigator anticipate patient schedule 45 minute image . Small fraction dose administer initially infusion myocardial perfusion first pas image dynamic contrast enhance ( DCE ) technique . After full dose administer , steady state high-resolution image undertaken use ultrafast spoiled gradient echo sequence . Cardiac MR consist cardiac output , end systolic volume , end diastolic volume , aortic distensibility flow Cardiac MR perform . Images obtain leave ventricular right ventricular mass function plus flow quantification . The MRA review vascular radiology consultant ( 6 20 year ' experience ) standard clinical report issue finding . At end study , image ( US Doppler , CTA investigatory MRA ) jointly review radiologist investigator study team . An independent radiologist directly involve study also review image . All discrepancy resolve mutual consensus radiologist . The general analytical approach estimate accuracy ( 95 % CI ) , sensitivity ( 95 % CI ) specificity ( 95 % CI ) FeMRA standard image technique . In addition , Cohen 's κ 95 % CI compute quantify agreement FeMRA standard image finding . A value κ &gt; 0.7 indicates high level agreement . Because multiple image location patient use statistical evaluation ( least 20 vascular cross section scan ) , interdependence location give patient examination assess use κ statistic . A value κ &lt; 0.4 indicate weak interdependence . The investigator aim recruit 20 patient group A 10 patient two group . Assuming FeMRA identify 10 % clinically significant vascular anatomic characteristic compare CTA/US , one would need study 180 vascular section total show significant difference test use chi-squared test , assume power 80 % probability type 1 error 5 % . To evaluate association anatomical predictor variable outcomes , multiple linear logistic mixed-effects regression model use . Associations fistula graft outcome predictor treat uniform across anatomical configuration unless strong statistical biological evidence suggest otherwise . Based data retrospective study perform centre , investigator assume fistula failure rate 30 % .</detailed_description>
