	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well ibrutinib blinatumomab work treat patient B acute lymphoblastic leukemia come back respond treatment . Ibrutinib may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Monoclonal antibody , blinatumomab , may interfere ability cancer cell grow spread . Giving ibrutinib blinatumomab may work well treat patient relapse refractory B acute lymphoblastic leukemia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ibrutinib Blinatumomab Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory B Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate efficacy ibrutinib blinatumomab patient relapse refractory B acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( B-ALL ) measure complete response ( CR ) rate . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To examine efficacy safety ibrutinib blinatumomab patient relapse refractory B-ALL measure overall response rate ( ORR , define CR plus CR incomplete count recovery [ CRi ] ) , relapse free survival ( RFS ) , overall survival ( OS ) , minimal residual disease ( MRD ) response , proportion patient bridge allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant ( allo-HCT ) , toxicity .</detailed_description>
