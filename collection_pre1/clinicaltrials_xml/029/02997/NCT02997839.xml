	<brief_summary>The role sleep patient admit intensive care unit emerge field research . There study show patient ICU poor sleep include sleep fragmentation , multiple arousal , decrease stage 3 sleep reduce REM sleep ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) . Causes poor sleep ICU include severity illness , abnormal light exposure , frequent arousal medical care . Not poor sleep contribute reduce cognitive function delirium , also implication immune system function wound heal ( 4 ) . Polysomnography regard gold standard sleep study , however limited utility ICU population ( 5 ) alternative method sleep analysis need investigate well understand underlie physiologic mechanism subsequent cognitive effect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The importance sleep patient intensive care unit ( ICU ) well document . Research show ICU multiple risk factor poor sleep , multiple effect patient outcome . Further research need good define best tool use measure sleep stage ICU patient . Furthermore , limit data compare sleep interruption ICU patient effect sleep architecture cognition . Hypothesis 1a : The number episodes rapid eye movement ( REM ) , stage 1 , stage 2 , stage 3 sleep , sleep spindle , alpha activity increase total duration activity duration episodes decline postoperative neurologic critical care unit ( NCCU ) neurological check every two hour 12 hour period record compare every 6 hour . Hypothesis 1b : As number episode REM , stage 1 , stage 2 , stage 3 sleep , sleep spindle , alpha activity increase total duration activity duration episodes decline postoperative NCCU neurological check every two hour 12 hour period record compare every 6 hour . Hypothesis 2 : The number episode , total duration , interval duration , REM , stage 1 , stage 2 , stage 3 sleep , sleep spindle , alpha activity identical automate recording compare human read sleep train Neurologist . Hypothesis 3 : The group awaken every two hour report objective sleepiness perform psychomotor visual task ( PVT ) increase time reduced performance . Performing study allow validation automate EEG system interpretation sleep . If tool reliable method sleep interpretation , may expand large population ICU patient research effect sleep deprivation . Additionally , add prospective data literature regard psychomotor effect increase sleep interruption ICU patient . 2 . Objectives ( include primary secondary objective ) 1 . Detect effect disrupt sleep result frequent neurological exam NCCU post-surgical patient . We use automated EEG detection system use patient continuous EEG ( cEEG ) monitoring detect duration sleep relate EEG brain activity , number interval activation , duration interval sleep activity include : REM , Stage 1 , stage 2 , stage 3 sleep , sleep spindle , alpha activity . 2 . We study precision , accuracy bias automate algorithm compare interpretation two sleep trained neurologist read recording blind manner independently one another . We select record validate automatic scorer include identification duration aspect cEEG sleep record first four hour sleep record patient . We compare accuracy identification measure duration REM , Stage one , stage two , stage 3 sleep , sleep spindle , alpha activity . 3 . Subjective measure sleep assessment use Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire ( RCSG ) . 4 . Quantitative assessment alertness use psychomotor vigilance task ( PVT ) .</detailed_description>
