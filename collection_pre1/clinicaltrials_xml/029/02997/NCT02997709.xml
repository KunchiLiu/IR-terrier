	<brief_summary>Prostate cancer common malignancy men nearly 30,000 death occur disease year . Not significant mortality , also considerable morbidity primary salvage therapy . Understanding patient require intensified treatment , well might require treatment , would improve outcomes multiple level . The cohort investigate comprise men intermediate high risk prostate cancer candidate radiotherapy ( RT ) . The overarch objective CoMBINe trial identify pretreatment post-treatment prognostic predictive factor derive quantitative imaging prostate feature , tumor tissue gene expression signature , circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) . The CoMBINe trial sister trial another study , term BLaStM ( IRB # 20140627 ) , men candidate radiotherapy . CoMBINe also allow men oligometastasis sometimes treat RT prostate limit metastatic site .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary objective -To investigate relationship quantitative imaging parameter ( multiparametric MRI ) pretreatment ( pre-Tx ) post-treatment change circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) time prostate cancer patient receive treatment radiotherapy ± androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) per standard care Department Radiation Oncology University Miami . Secondary objectives - To evaluate whether CTC change and/or quantitative imaging parameter change associate patient outcome ( biochemical clinical disease failure ) . - To evaluate whether ADT affect quantitative imaging feature and/or CTC level patient receive therapy . - To investigate relationship quantitative imaging characteristic and/or circulate tumor cell ( CTC ) change tissue biomarkers ( e.g. , gene expression signature ) obtain pre-treatment MRI ultrasound ( US ) fusion guide prostate biopsy . - In patient undergone MRI-US fusion guide biopsy ( MUFgBx ) 2-2.5 year plan treatment , investigate relationship quantitative imaging characteristic , circulate tumor cell ( CTC ) change , and/or pretreatment biopsy tissue gene expression pattern endpoint prostate research biopsy status . Treatment -Radiotherapy technique dose , well use androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) , per standard care University Miami , specify protocol .</detailed_description>
