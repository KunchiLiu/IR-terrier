	<brief_summary>Rationale : Accurate stag lung cancer important directs treatment determine prognosis . The development Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy ( SABR ) , revolutionize radiation therapy early stage lung cancer result demonstrate similar outcome comparison surgical resection lung tumor . The staging work-up program patient potentially resectable Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) include least computed tomography ( CT ) scan chest integrate Positron Emission Tomography - Computed Tomography ( PET/CT ) scan , indicate , invasive mediastinal staging . However , patient treat SABR routinely undergo nodal stag work-up surgical candidate . As surgery SABR appear achieve comparable rate local regional tumor control , appear logical perform similar stag work-up patient early stage lung cancer treat either two curative local modality . In past , lack invasive nodal sample SABR consider acceptable invasive surgical staging ( mediastinoscopy ) widely consider preferred procedure . However , minimally invasive safe endosonography procedure available , improved pre-treatment staging become possible patient group eligible SABR , include significant comorbidities . Hypothesis : Complete endosonographic ( combine endobronchial esophageal ) stag hilar mediastinal lymph node patient ( suspect ) non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) result change loco-regional nodal status 20 % patient , comparison stag PET-CT alone . Study population : Patients either establish suspect early-stage NSCLC medically inoperable , refuse surgery potential candidate SABR curative intent ( provide intrathoracic metastasis present ) . Patients undergo single scope complete mediastinal hilar stag procedure ( combine EndoBronchial UltraSound ( EBUS ) Transesophageal Endoscopic Ultrasound EBUS scope ( EUS-B ) ) .</brief_summary>
