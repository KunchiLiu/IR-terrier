	<detailed_description>Chronic psychological distress lead chronic exhaustion condition , burnout . This clinical condition characterize reduced satisfaction performance , exhaustion depersonalization . Individuals prolong exposure chronic work-life stress insufficient recovery high risk develop burnout symptom . Social service , caregiving teach profession perceive imbalance effort reward often affect . Until , general accept definition burnout syndrome binding diagnostic criterion establish . Moreover , strong association chronic psychological distress somatoform symptom , like sleep disturbance , headache abdominal pain fully explain medical neurological condition . Physiologically hypothalamus pituitary adrenal axis ( HPA-axis ) central system long term adaptation organism stress . During stress exposure , HPA-axis activate adrenal cortex produce high level cortisol stress inhibitory function time . However , exposure long-term chronic stress associate biological dysregulation result hypofunctioning HPA-axis state hypocortisolism . In addition , serotonergic system , immune system amino acid metabolism get adversely affect . Stress-related eating behaviour frequently result imbalance amino acid deficiency micronutrient ( i. e. B-vitamins magnesium ) cause endocrine-cardiometabolic abnormality . Intake specific amino acid affect brain functioning mental health . Some amino acid precursor neurotransmitter brain . Moreover , l-ornithine taurine suggest antifatigue effect . Dietary intake B-vitamins magnesium , important stress-mineral , positive effect mood perceive stress . Aim study demonstrate , daily oral administration specific amino acid composition ( dosage 4.2 g/day ) micronutrient ( e. g. 7 vitamin B-complex , magnesium , zinc ) design decrease chronic exhaustion condition significantly decrease perceive chronic distress associate chronic exhaustion condition woman men 8 12 week .</detailed_description>
