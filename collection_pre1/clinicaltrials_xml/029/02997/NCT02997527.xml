	<detailed_description>In patient gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) without gross evidence esophageal injury , confirmation acid reflux typically perform test measure reflux proximal 5 cm gastroesophageal junction . These test pH/impedance monitor Bravo probe placement esophagus gold standard diagnose quantitating degree gastroesophageal reflux . This stand contrast concept esophagus distal 5 cm first foremost expose gastroesophageal reflux injury form erosive esophagitis see 4cm segment instrument measure reflux . As result , type testing may allow full understand pathophysiology GERD . Furthermore , refluxed acid exposure limit distal esophagus patient , use conventional pH test could lead inaccurate diagnose GERD . Esophageal impedance test measure epithelial integrity reflect ability mucosa conduct electric current . As dilation intercellular space biopsy patient GERD consider early indication esophageal injury response reflux absence gross endoscopic injury , measure increase current conduction dilate space show accurate mean diagnose patient non-erosive reflux disease . To point , esophageal impedance measure use impedance port place location similar pH probe combine intra-esophageal ambulatory catheter . As result , distal point impedance measurement also 5 cm gastroesophageal junction . Recently , site specific endoscopically place impedance probe develop measure esophageal mucosal impedance point esophagus . In study Principal Investigator would like look patient without reflux symptom measure impedance 1,2,3,4 5 cm 6 o'clock position Gastroesophageal Junction .</detailed_description>
