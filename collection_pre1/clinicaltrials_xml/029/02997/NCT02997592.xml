	<detailed_description>The SpinCare electrospinning portable device intend external treatment burn wound . The SpinCare first make spot , bed side , completely personalize dressing system ; excellent coverage size , shape difficult contour . The nano-fibrous dressing mimic structure natural body tissue create excellent medium tissue repair heal . The objective study evaluate performance , safety efficacy SpinCare System treatment superficial intermediate partial thickness burn . The study include 6 site . Adult patient superficial intermediate partial thickness burn ( second degree superficial intermediate ) 10 % TBSA ( Total Body Surface Area ) ; independent burn 5 % TBSA . A prospective single arm , safety efficacy , open label , multi-center study treatment partial thickness burn wound consider surgery use SpinCare System . 20 patient enrol study . Primary endpoint : - Wound heal re-epithelialization day 21 . - The burn consider heal least 95 % total area re-epithelialized scab exist . - Ease use - At postoperative day 7 , 14 , 21 - Dermal safety assess Draize Score - Visual estimate wound heal re-epithelialization - Pain - Infection - Itching - Itching scar quality 3 6 month - Itching scar quality 12 month ( optional ) - Device related adverse event</detailed_description>
