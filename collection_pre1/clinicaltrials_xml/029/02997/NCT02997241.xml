	<detailed_description>Colorectal cancer third common cancer worldwide . About two-thirds patient good therapeutic effect combine surgical adjuvant treatment . But still 30-40 % patient may relapse . Efficient relapse early surveillance accurate treatment decision avoid excessive medical treatment，and keep timely intervention tumor recurrence well . That 's important extend survival patient . Currently , efficient surveillance tool recommend surveillance guideline include clinical assessment , serum carcinoembryonic antigen testing , colonoscopy CT. Cell-free DNA ( cfDNA ) ，the free form DNA plasma，derived normal cell , abnormal cell ( tumor cell ) external ( viral DNA ) . The plasma cell-free DNA derive tumor cell circulate tumour DNA ( ctDNA ) . As solid tumor , include CRC , release ctDNA blood , precision medical application ctDNA liquid biopsy colorectal cancer predict recurrence aid treatment decision become hot topic . Recent research show substantially colorectal cancer patient somatic genetic alteration , include single-base mutation large somatic structural variation ( SSVs ) . Mutations gene use biomarkers evaluate tumor burden , predict recurrence supply information treatment decision monitor quantify ctDNA . In program，sequencing tissue colorectal cancer patient capture technology TM next generation sequencing ( NGS ) , specific somatic mutations，the so-called biomarkers , found.The analysis result sequence help study tumor molecular pathology supply information targetable drug.The continuous monitoring biomarkers plasma predict recurrence supply information treatment decision . In phase I trials， recruit 200 volunteer colorectal cancer recruited.the investigator test recurrence predicting project OncocareTM ( method mention ) . In phase Ⅱ trials，the colorectal cancer patient categorize four group basis genetic risk judge OncocareTM clinical risk judge Clinical routine method . Particular emphasis group low genetic risk high clinical risk group high genetic risk low clinical risk . The purpose study determine relationship change gene copy recurrence，and overall survival 5 year chemotherapy base clinical prognosis compare Oncocare detection prognosis .</detailed_description>
