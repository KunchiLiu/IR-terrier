	<brief_summary>Both pelvic mass preoperative diagnosis still continue important investigation subject . It important discriminate diagnosis leiomyoma adenomyosis operation especially among infertile patient . Neoplasms alter systemic local immune response originate area.Neutrophil lymphocyte ratio ( NLR ) platelet lymphocyte ratio ( PLR ) readily determine use complete blood counter test ( CBC ) . A high NLR show systemic inflammation , gynecologic gastrointestinal cancer cardiovascular disease . The investigator aim investigate use new inflammation marker , NLR PLR , whether useful discriminate adenomyosis leiomyoma . As far know , previous report association among NLR , PLR , adenomyosis leiomyoma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A retrospective cross-sectional study conduct Kayseri Education Research Hospital , Department Obstetrics Gynecology , Kayseri , Turkey , January 2016 October 2016 . Approval Institutional Review Board Kayseri Erciyes University Faculty Medicine obtain advance ( 2016/525 ) . Exclusion criterion fallows ; diabetes mellitus , metabolic disorder , acute chronic infection disease , hypertension , acute coroner artery disease , connective tissue disorder , vasculitis , inflammatory bowel disease , tobacco alcohol use , renal failure , hepatitis , patient use corticosteroid drug patient underwent blood transfusion within three month . The investigator review database 386 patient refer abnormal uterine bleeding resistant medical treatment detect pelvic mass postmenopausal premenopausal period underwent hysterectomy department . The investigator capable include 196 patient present study exclusion criterion . There three group study . First group call adenomyosis consist patient pathologically diagnosed pure adenomyosis hysterectomy . Second group call leiomyoma consist patient pathologically diagnosed pure leiomyoma hysterectomy . Third group call control group consist healthy patient pathologically diagnose neoplasm hysterectomy . In order evaluate serum level hemoglobin , leukocyte , neutrophil , lymphocyte , platelet CA125 , investigator obtain data analysis measure preoperatively venous blood sample subject . The NLR define absolute neutrophil count divide absolute lymphocyte count PLR define absolute platelet count divide absolute lymphocyte count .</detailed_description>
