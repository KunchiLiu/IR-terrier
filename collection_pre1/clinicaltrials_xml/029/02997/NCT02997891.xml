	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate effectiveness hip arthroplasty chronic pain , cause unilateral primary Coxartrhrose , regard cognitive performance . It base hypothesis combination chronic pain along relative immobilization cause impairment cognitive performance . The total hip replacement reduces pain , increase mobility level finally improve cognitive performance .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Change Cognitive Performance Through Hip Replacement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Studies show cognitive performance , especially elderly limited due chronic pain . In recent study , significantly less brain activity various region brain ( anterior cingulate cortex ( ACC ) , insula operculum , dorsolateral prefrontal cortex orbitofrontal cortex ) detect patient unilateral primary coxarthrosis compare healthy control group . After eliminate pain implantation total hip replacement , significant increase brain activity affect area observed patient . Whether observation accompany effect cognition , know investigate propose study . The purpose study investigate effectiveness hip arthroplasty chronic pain , cause unilateral primary Coxartrhrose , regard cognitive performance . It base hypothesis combination chronic pain along relative immobilization cause impairment cognitive performance . The total hip replacement reduces pain , increase mobility level finally improve cognitive performance . The main issue concern short mid-term influence hip replacement cognitive performance perioperative care continuum comparison control group chronic pain . To objectively quantify everyday activity , variety instrument , without currently gold standard . Therefore , addition investigator use objectified measurement parameter aid pedometer ( GARMIN vivofit ) every three measure time point ( surgery , 3 month surgery , 6 month surgery ) . Standardized neuropsychological assessment method use assess cognitive performance . To assess degree mobility , health status physical activity standardize questionnaire use . Primary hypothesis : After implantation artificial hip replacement reduction experience pain patient primary coxarthrosis indicate improvement cognitive performance 3 6 month surgery compare pre-surgical status . In addition , investigator measure severe cognitive performance reduce compare healthy control group prior surgery extend cognitive performance reversible aftermath .</detailed_description>
