	<brief_summary>The goal study determine optical spectroscopy characteristic tumor patient head neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) . HNSCC constitute 90 % head neck cancer . These spectroscopy measurement compare pathological diagnosis tissue biopsy site . These reading perform operating room routine endoscopy biopsy tumor mapping patient suspect squamous cell carcinoma head and/or neck . Furthermore , build pressure sensor use compare biopsy sit benign counterpart . If successful , optical measurement could use survey delineate extent malignancy noninvasive manner . This would especially helpful clinic visit suspicious lesion see would otherwise require biopsy diagnosis . Immediate benefit would include patient unknown primary numerous directed biopsy obtain multiple head neck site .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY : HYPOTHESES : Noninvasive optical spectroscopic measurement Head Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma ( HNSCC ) result unique signature differentiate dysplasia , normal , benign condition well response radiation therapy assess clinical histopathological method . STUDY OBJECTIVES 1 . Characterization physiological morphological feature clinical HNSCCs use spectroscopy base quantitative optical sensor 2 . Evaluate built-in pressure sensor probe mean make measurement consistent , narrow pressure range . This device use compare spectroscopy measurement histopathological diagnosis . Subjects undergo optical measurement time routine biopsy suspect squamous cell carcinoma head and/or neck . Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy measurement lesion clinical interest , well distant normal tissue . Three five repeat scan obtain measure site . The clinical `` tumor '' site biopsied . Samples collect normal tissue biopsy . The result spectroscopy measurement research purpose use confirm subject 's diagnosis . The optical spectrometer breach skin defense barrier . As study involve noninvasive optical measurement tissue , significant safety concern anticipate . The protocol measurement take less one minute per site . The total amount extend OR time expect less 5 minute . No additional charge subject and/or insurance company expect . Qualitative analysis perform describe whether correlation spectroscopy measurement pathologic diagnosis .</detailed_description>
