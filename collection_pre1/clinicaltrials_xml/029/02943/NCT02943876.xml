	<brief_summary>Major depressive episode ( MDE ) one prevalent disable form mental illness general population . Despite increased mental health service antidepressant use past 10 year , measurable change prevalence MDE Canadian general population , motivate search additional strategy reduce burden MDE . One strategy successful field oncology , cardiology diabetes early identification prevention - identifying people high risk take preventive action low risk prevent symptom progress MDE . As multivariable risk prediction algorithm use estimate individual 's risk ( probability ) future disease , play important role process early identification . The propose study stem project fund operating grant Canadian Institutes Health Research ( CIHR ) . With CIHR support , team develop validated sex-specific prediction algorithm MDE . As risk prediction early stage psychiatry MDE still highly stigmatize , facilitate future implementation develop risk prediction algorithm , propose study seek answer follow research question : ( 1 ) Does disclosure personalize depression risk information promote high-risk individual take preventive action ? ( 2 ) Will disclosure personalize depression risk information negatively affect high-risk people 's mental health status term increase psychological distress ? To answer question , investigator plan conduct randomized control trial ( RCT ) embed qualitative component . The propose study develop evidence base guide disclosure personalize risk information understand process risk communication consumer empowerment , contribute advancement early prevention MDE Canada .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Impact Disclosing Personalized Depression Risk Information High-risk Individuals ' Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : The propose study stem CIHR project drive result knowledge translation ( KT ) activity . The investigator develop first sex-specific risk prediction model major depressive episode ( MDE ) use data 10,000 Canadians . The model include age , personal family history MDE , childhood trauma , predictor may change time . Using model , individual answer question : risk MDE next 4 year ? Knowing personalize risk information may assist health professional communicate patient plan preventive action ; disclose information may also empower consumer actively engage self-help . In past 5 year , KT activity 500 stakeholder inform investigator need clearly delineate benefit ( enhance risk perception self-help ) potential risk ( increased psychological distress impaired function ) disclose information implementing tool . The goal study produce evidence benefit potential risk associate risk disclosure ( i.e. , expect output ) . The primary objective compare receive personalize depression risk information ( 1 ) accuracy risk perception , use self-help strategy , ( 2 ) change psychological distress functional measure one year among high risk MDE . The secondary objective examine differential impact disclosure outcomes demographic level baseline risk . To achieve objective , investigator propose 3-year randomized control trial ( RCT ) embed qualitative component . The propose study RCT embed qualitative component . The RCT one interventional arm ( receive personalize depression risk information ) one control arm . The personalized depression risk generate use sex-specific prediction algorithm MDE develop Canadians age 18+ year old . Because prediction algorithm sex-specific , investigator propose recruit 350 men 350 woman baseline . After baseline assessment eligibility , participant randomize intervention control group , men woman separately . To obtain in-depth information personalize depression risk information process participant information affect emotionally , research team conduct qualitative interview 1 month personalize risk information disclose . To understand personalize risk information affect participant ' health behavior , investigator conduct another round qualitative interview 12-month . Recruitment : The target population future preventive study high risk individual general population , reside different region across country . For propose study , feasible approach recruit eligible participant random digit dial method ( RDD ) . In past 10 year , use RDD recruitment CIHR-funded longitudinal study ongoing national RCT fund Movember Foundation . Recruitment , screen baseline assessment do telephone interview firm identify competitive bidding process . A random sample land line cell phone number select . When household reach , person 18+ year assessed eligibility . If household 2+ person age 18+ year , one randomly select . The interviewer explain study objective procedure answer question . Potential participant ensure confidentiality , participation voluntary may withdraw time . Oral consent obtain assessment eligibility . Outcome measure assess baseline , 6 12-month . Baseline Assessment Randomization Screening : Once potentially eligible participant identify , interviewer confirm participant 's age administer World Health Organization 's Composite International Diagnostic Interview - Short Form Major Depression ( CIDI-SFMD ) sex-specific prediction algorithm . Interviewees MDE risk threshold base risk calculator , exclude . Individuals MDE encourage contact family doctor information local mental health resource provide . For low risk , web site sex-specific risk prediction algorithm ( www.predictingdepression.com ) provide may monitor risk future . Baseline assessment : In eligible participant , interviewer administer Non-specific Psychological Distress Scale ( K10 ) , Self-help Strategy Use Scale ( SSUS ) , ask question absenteeism perceive risk MDE . Our pilot study show screen baseline assessment take 20 25 minute . Randomization carry men woman separately . Eligible participant complete baseline telephone interview randomize intervention control group . The randomization conduct manage project coordinator affiliate project . 350 random number ( 0 1 ) first generate men woman separately use Excel ( `` RAND ( ) '' ) 350 study identification number ( ID ) , range 1 350 . The 350 random number sort descend order categorize 2 equal group : - ID number first group ( n = 175 ) allocate control group - ID number second group ( n = 175 ) allocate intervention group Intervention Control : For participant intervention group , personalize risk disclose interviewer inform contact 6 month 12 month . The interest receive personalize depression information confirm recent pilot study use sample method . The team 's pilot data ( n = 200 ) show 100 % high-risk individual interested knowing risk . Participants intervention group also inform may contact one month 30-minute qualitative interview . A package include follow material mail intervention participant : ( 1 ) thank-you letter , ( 2 ) website contain general information MDE , self-help strategy . ( 3 ) $ 20 incentive appreciation participation . For participant control group , project coordinator inform contact 6 12 month . Their personal risk provide 12-month interview . The control group participant receive package intervention group . Blinding follow-up assessment : The telephone interviewer securely transfer encrypted baseline data PI bi-weekly basis . The group assignment data transfer separate file . The follow-up assessment conduct telephone interview laboratory Mathison Mental Health Research &amp; Education Center . One month schedule follow-up interview , letter send participant remind upcoming interview . After 12-month interview , participant ' group status link interview data study ID number . Over study period , investigator blind participant ' group status . The interviewer conduct randomization , involve follow-up interview . The interviewer conduct follow-up interview Calgary access participant ' group status . Given description study objective , participant may know group status . Therefore , possible participant control group may try find information personalize depression risk . At follow-up assessment , research staff ask use risk prediction tool study period . At follow-up assessment , participant develop MDE , encourage contact family doctor information local mental health resource provide . Qualitative Interviews : To obtain in-depth information disclose personalize depression risk affect participant ' decision process , mental health health behavior , investigator conduct two round qualitative interview via telephone , 1 month participant receive personalize depression risk 12 month . Each include initial random sub-sample 20 men 20 woman intervention group . The qualitative interview strengthen study researcher use finding `` triangulate '' quantitative result guide interpretation quantitative result . The interview audio record . Qualitative interview transcribe verbatim analyze inductively theme . As per Berg theme choose `` reflect relevant aspect message . '' The analysis follow interpretive practice constant comparison attempt uncover pattern within interview . Nvivo 10 software use support thematic analysis . It expect achieve theoretical saturation initial sample . However , new theme continue emerge final interview , interview conduct new theme emerge . Risk mitigation : The investigator acknowledge concern change response rate telephone survey due cell phone use telemarketing . Including eligible participant across country enhance generalizability study . Given vast geographic area Canada , RDD feasible method . The goal study recruit participant RCT , rather select representative sample . In RCT , selection bias serious concern long bias across intervention control group . To mitigate risk , interviewer also access validate cellphone database . However use cellphone number associate increased cost . Another potential risk propose study attrition may incur selection bias . The population-based cohort study mental disorder workplace , conduct lab , show could achieve 77 % response rate one year follow-up without financial incentive . The strategy reduce attrition include appropriately design introductory script , minimum nine call back attempt space weekday time day provision $ 20 incentive complete interview . Finally , deem low risk go develop MDE exclude RCT screen stage , limitation . investigator plan provide risk prediction algorithm monitor risk future .</detailed_description>
