	<brief_title>Post-operative Mobilisation After Rotator Cuff Repair</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rotator cuff tear frequent problem , increase age1 . Thus arthroscopic repair frequent surgery . Despite important number cuff repair , re-tear rate varies 20 90 % depend tear severity type repair1,2 . Many factor implicate tendon heal post-operative clinical result . Some unchangeable ( age , tear size , chronicityâ€¦ ) surgeon control like surgical technique post-operative rehabilitation protocol . It exist many surgical repair techniques6 , 7 , massive development technology last twenty year . However term rehabilitation , study evidence best practices4 . The main aspect surgeon act , immobilization time . Actually , standard protocol include immobilisation 4 6 week physiotherapy beginning5 . A recent review literature3 highlight five study compare different rehabilitation protocol , include different immobilization period range 0 8 week , different type mobilization ( physiotherapist supervision , machine ) . They find similar rate re-tear different protocol . But early passive motion enables improve range motion first 3-6 month , similar result one year . However study , patient wear sling least 4 week , even early mobilization group . But investigators n't know sling really useful , probably investigator follow logic faster recovery long term result early mobilization . At best knowledge , study seek compare usefulness sling wear rotator cuff repair . Removing sling could simplify rehabilitation provide return normal function faster , great satisfaction similar rate re-tear . The aim study compare rehabilitation wear sling , rehabilitation without immobilization arthroscopic repair supraspinatus tendon .</detailed_description>
