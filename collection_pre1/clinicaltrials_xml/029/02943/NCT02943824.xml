	<brief_summary>The propose , mono-institutional , randomized-controlled trial aim determine whether dosimetric outcome follow prostate Low-Dose-Rate ( LDR ) brachytherapy , plan use novel machine learning ( ML-LDR ) algorithm , equivalent manual treatment planning technique . Forty-two patient low-to-intermediate-risk prostate cancer plan use ML-LDR expert manual treatment plan course 12-month study . Expert radiation oncology ( RO ) physicians evaluate modify blind , randomize plan prior implantation patient . Planning time , pre-operative dosimetry , plan modification assess treatment , post-operative dosimetry evaluate 1-month following implant , respectively .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Outline : Traditionally treatment plan prostate Low-Dose-Rate ( LDR ) brachytherapy rely manual planning expert treatment planner . This process involve planner selecting location 80-110 small , radioactive seed within prostate ; goal process maximize amount radiation deliver cancer minimize radiation healthy tissue , make sure seed implantable physician . Although process effective time-consuming ( take anywhere 30 minute several hour plan ) . Machine learning ( ML ) , form statistical computation relies historical train information adapt predict novel solution , significant potential improving efficiency uniformity prostate LDR brachytherapy . The ability algorithm mimic several feature demonstrate expert treatment plan difficult perform use conventional computer algorithm significant advantage . It expect implement ML program planning workflow prostate LDR brachytherapy possible significantly decrease planning time , improve uniformity plan outcomes , maintain comparable quality human planner . This study evaluate whether computer program base machine learning ( ML ) use maintain plan quality prostate LDR brachytherapy inferior manual planning human expert . In addition , expect planning time may decrease minute use ML planning . What Will Happen : If decide participate study first visit involve ultrasound study prostate map treatment area . After initial visit ultrasound image nothing required part purpose study . Your image treatment information use create brachytherapy treatment plan human planner , one ML program . Only one treatment plan one group ( process know randomization ) use , treat physician know plan come ( process know blinding ) . Your physician examine plan , grade acceptability , make modification need . This final plan use deliver brachytherapy . Follow-Up Visits : You follow-up study approximately 1 month brachytherapy treatment . The purpose study gauge well brachytherapy deliver . For follow-up study CT scan show area treat ( prostate gland ) . No action require part . Length Study Participation : Your participation study follow-up visit , approximately 1 month brachytherapy treatment . A total 42 patient enrol study Odette Cancer Centre .</detailed_description>
