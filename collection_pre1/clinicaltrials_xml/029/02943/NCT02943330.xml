	<brief_summary>Depression one common psychiatric disease , prevalence estimate range 5 % 20 % . Depression recognize brain disease ; manage treat effectively wide range option , biological basis still far clear . Studies monozygotic dizygotic twin pair suggest polygenic inheritance , overall heritability estimate 40 % 70 % . Gene-environment interaction recognize long time pathophysiology depression , best biological substratum present represent serotonin transporter ( 5-HTT ) gene . It would interest study association novel allelic variant least triallelic 5-HTTLPR polymorphism depression . Depression common patient end-stage renal disease occur 20 % 30 % hemodialysis patient . Interferon-induced depression estimate 50 % among patient hepatitis C. Several set observation support supposition cytokine , proinflammatory cytokine particular , involved depressive disorder . Depression sufferer report elevated blood level interleukin 1 ( IL-1 ) , IL-6 tumor necrosis factor α ( TNF-α ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aim study examine relation depression psychiatric family history , candidate gene , cytokine health-related quality life among hemodialysis patient patient receive interferon treatment hepatitis C. The investigator aim recruit 200 hemodialysis patient 100 patient receive interferon treatment hepatitis C Chang Gung Memorial Hospital , Keelung . Our pilot study find among hemodialysis patient , prevalence rate probable anxiety disorder probably depression disorder 25.9 % 40.0 % . Among patient receive interferon treatment hepatitis C , prevalence rate probable anxiety disorder probably depression disorder 30.2 % 20.7 % baseline , 44.0 % 36.2 % 3 month interferon treatment . The study procedure consist 2 part . For first one , recruit hemodialysis patient receive assessment fatigue symptom use Fatigue Scale , depressive symptom use Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale ( HADS ) Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) , Short-form Health-related Quality Life ( SF-36 ) , blood level IL-1β , IL-6 TNF-αas well psychiatric diagnostic interview Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview ( MINI ) Family Interview Genetic Study ( FIGS ) . The second one prospective follow patient receive interferon treatment . Before initiate interferon treatment , subject receive baseline assessment use scale mention . The investigator genotype 5-HTTLPR triallelic polymorphism subject . The follow-up visit month 1 , month 3 , termination , one month termination interferon program . This propose project provide broad view well understand gene-environment interaction etiology depression .</detailed_description>
