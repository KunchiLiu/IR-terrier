	<criteria>Have histologically cytologicallyconfirmed diagnosis adenocarcinoma GEJ stomach . Have newly diagnose localize locally advanced ( T1N13M0 T24NanyM0 ) , potentially resectable disease without prior systemic chemotherapy . Have evidence distant metastasis ( determine EUS , PETCT stag laparoscopy ) . Be eligible reasonably fit undergo potentially curative resection Must 18 75 year age . 6 . Be willing able provide write informed consent/assent trial . Have measurable disease base RECIST 1.1 . Have preresection tissue ( EGD EUS biopsy diagnosis ) available . Be willing provide tissue newly obtain core excisional biopsy tumor lesion . Newlyobtained defined specimen obtain 6 week ( 42 day ) prior initiation treatment Day 1 . Subjects newlyobtained sample provide ( e.g . inaccessible subject safety concern ) may submit archived specimen upon agreement Sponsor . Have performance status 0 1 ECOG Performance Scale . Demonstrate adequate organ function : Be willing provide blood tissue sample research purpose Female subject childbearing potential negative urine serum pregnancy within 72 hour prior receive first dose study medication . If urine test positive confirm negative , serum pregnancy test require . Female subject childbearing potential must willing use adequate method contraception course study 120 day last dose study medication . Male subject childbearing potential must agree use adequate method contraception start first dose study therapy 120 day last dose study therapy . Has receive prior chemotherapy malignant disorder , thoracic radiation therapy prior surgical resection esophagogastric tumor . Has biopsyproven invasion tracheobronchial tree tracheoesophageal fistula . Has distant metastatic disease image stag laparoscopy time study entry . Has diagnosis immunodeficiency receive systemic steroid therapy form immunosuppressive therapy within 7 day prior first dose trial treatment . Has know history active TB ( Bacillus Tuberculosis ) Hypersensitivity pembrolizumab excipients . Has prior anticancer monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) within 4 week prior study Day 1 recover ( i.e. , ≤ Grade 1 baseline ) adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Clinically significant ( ≥ grade 2 ) peripheral neuropathy time study entry . Has know additional malignancy progress require active treatment . Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma skin squamous cell carcinoma skin undergone potentially curative therapy situ cervical cancer . Has know active central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis . Subjects previously treat brain metastasis may participate provide stable ( without evidence progression image least four week prior first dose trial treatment neurologic symptom return baseline ) , evidence new enlarge brain metastasis , use steroid least 7 day prior trial treatment . This exception include carcinomatous meningitis exclude regardless clinical stability . Has active autoimmune disease require systemic treatment past 2 year ( i.e . use disease modify agent , corticosteroid immunosuppressive drug ) . Replacement therapy ( eg. , thyroxine , insulin , physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy adrenal pituitary insufficiency , etc . ) consider form systemic treatment . Has know history , evidence active , noninfectious pneumonitis . Has active infection require systemic therapy . Has history current evidence condition , therapy , laboratory abnormality might confound result trial , interfere subject 's participation full duration trial , best interest subject participate , opinion treat investigator . Has know psychiatric substance abuse disorder would interfere cooperation requirement trial . Is pregnant breastfeeding , expect conceive father child within project duration trial , start prescreening screen visit 120 day last dose trial treatment . Has receive prior therapy antiPD1 , antiPDL1 , antiPDL2 agent . Has know history Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) ( HIV 1/2 antibody ) . Has know active Hepatitis B Hepatitis C. Inoperable basis coexistent medical problem . Nonmalignant systemic disease ( cardiovascular , renal , hepatic , etc . ) would preclude study drug . Has receive live vaccine within 30 day plan start study therapy .</criteria>
