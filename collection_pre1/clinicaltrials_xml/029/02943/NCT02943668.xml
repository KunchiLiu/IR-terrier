	<brief_title>Deferasirox Treating Patients With Very Low , Low , Intermediate-Risk Red Blood Cell Transfusion Dependent Anemia Myelodysplastic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess activity iron chelation therapy ( ICT ) deferasirox , patient anemia result myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Reduction red blood cell ( RBC ) transfusion requirement . II . Hematologic improvement . III . Change serum ferritin level baseline end study measure monthly basis . IV . Safety tolerability deferasirox . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Marrow sample take study erythropoiesis impact iron overload erythropoiesis . OUTLINE : Patients receive deferasirox orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) . Treatment continue 52 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
