	<brief_title>Study Investigate Safety , Pharmacokinetics , Pharmacodynamics Preliminary Clinical Activity Defactinib Combination With Avelumab Epithelial Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study comprise 2 sequential part : Part A ( Dose Escalation VS-6063 ) Part B ( Expansion ) . In Part A ( Dose Escalation ) , approximately 18 subject receive avelumab IV treatment 28-day cycle ( 10 mg/kg approximately 1 hour Days 1 15 ) oral defactinib twice-daily ( BID ) continuously start Day 1 Cycle 1 . Subject enrollment proceed accord standard 3+3 design . In absence dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) , subject receive study drug regimen minimum 28 day ( Cycle 1 ) may continue receive additional cycle study treatment disease progression document unacceptable toxicity treatment discontinuation criterion meet . All subject cohort must complete least 1 cycle dose dose escalation involve new subject enter next dose cohort occur . Based safety PK data obtain dose escalation portion study , RP2D combination determine . In Part B ( Expansion ) , approximately 80 subject enrol receive avelumab IV treatment 28-day cycle ( 10 mg/kg approximately 1 hour Days 1 15 ) oral defactinib RP2D dose continuously start Day 1 Cycle 1 .</detailed_description>
