	<brief_summary>This study evaluate immunogenicity reduce dose schedule Pneumococcal Conjugate vaccine ( PCV ) PCV10 PCV13 , child receive primary dose either 6 14 week age , follow booster dose 9 month age ( 1+1 schedule ) , compare immune response receive two dose primary series ( 6 14 week age ) booster dose 9-months ( 2+1 schedule ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pneumonia lead global cause childhood death outside neonatal period , contribute 19 % 10 million childhood death occur annually , majority occur industrialise country . Despite success improve primary healthcare South Africa since 1994 , pneumonia nevertheless remain leading cause childhood death South Africa , aggravate HIV/AIDS epidemic . Streptococcus pneumoniae recognise lead bacterial cause pneumonia child well identified common cause super-imposed bacterial infection individual respiratory virus-associated pneumonia . In South Africa , cost procurement PCV ( $ 20 per dose ) total almost 50 % total cost vaccine purchase national immunisation program . Similarly , PCV expensive vaccine purchase Global Alliance Vaccines Immunisation ( GAVI ) , heavily fund vaccine procurement low income country . The sustainability continue procurement vaccine current pricing low-middle income country remain uncertain . This randomized , open-label study ( laboratory personnel however blind ) subject randomize one two ( primary dose either 6 14 week age ) 1+1 dose schedule PCV10 PCV13 , 2+1 schedule vaccine . A total 600 subject randomize 1:1:1:1:1:1 ratio one six group . The study undertaken experience research site Johannesburg , South Africa , 600 child bear HIV-uninfected woman expect enrolled 12- month period .</detailed_description>
