	<brief_summary>While new innovation care extremely premature infant lead decreased morbidity mortality , poor postnatal growth remain major challenge . Early growth postnatal period influence neurodevelopmental growth outcomes . This propose study challenge current nutritional regimen infant &lt; 1000 g birth weight ( BW ) provide exclusive human milk base diet high amount protein base individual caloric protein analysis human milk utilizing target fortification . The investigator evaluate effect high versus standard protein enteral diet growth body composition infant &lt; 1000 g BW . There publish study evaluate effect exclusive human milk protein diet body composition premature infant . Research show infant receive diet achieve growth target standard body composition evaluate . As human milk diet well tolerate associate improved outcome high risk neonate , imperative evaluate benefit high protein exclusive human milk diet possible positive change body composition , specifically lean mass , infant . Results propose study immediately influence current nutritional practice provide landmark information regard target fortification provision adequate protein provide optimal body composition fragile vulnerable infant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Targeted Protein Fortification Extremely Low Birth Weight Preterm Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective : To evaluate effect high versus standard protein enteral diet utilizing target fortification linear growth infant &lt; 1000 g birth weight ( BW ) . Hypothesis 1 : Infants receive high protein diet increase length velocity 36 week postmenstrual age compare infant receive standard protein diet . Secondary Objective : To evaluate body composition total body dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) 36 week postmenstrual age infant &lt; 1000 g BW receive high standard protein enteral diet . Hypothesis 2 : Infants receive high protein diet great fat-free mass ( lean mass ) compare infant receive standard protein diet . Protein energy key nutrient growth . A low protein intake protein energy ratio may lead poor linear growth excess fat accumulation . Studies suggest preterm infant require high protein energy ratio obtain catch growth without excessive fat accretion growth focus length gain lean body mass . Macronutrient analysis donor human milk show mean protein value 1.16 g/dL similar term milk composition . Mother 's milk donor human milk protein content varies often low expect value . Infants may receive full amount calorie protein need support growth . The investigator plan challenge current nutritional regimen infant &lt; 1000 g BW provide enteral diet high amount protein base individual caloric protein analysis human milk also know targeted fortification . Study Design : Using prospective randomize study design , infants 500-1000 g BW receive exclusive human milk protein-based diet identify admission NICU . For infant meet inclusion criterion , parent/guardian approach study . After informed write parental consent obtain , infant randomize receive either high protein standard protein diet . The standard protein diet ( control group ) provide 3.5-3.8 g/kg/day protein represent current practice . The high protein diet ( intervention group ) provide 4.2-4.5 g/kg/day . Control group ( standard protein diet ) versus intervention group ( high protein diet ) : In control group ( standard protein diet ) , infant receive standard feed regimen consist mother 's milk donor human milk donor human milk derive fortifier . Once daily , 24 hour batch human milk prepare infant ( standard practice milk bank ) . A 2.5 mL sample batch human milk analyze calorie ( report kcal/oz ) protein , fat , carbohydrate ( report g/dL ) . Based amount protein milk , fortification feed donor human milk derive fortifier adjust reach average 3.5 3.8 g/kg/day protein . The intervention group ( high protein diet ) receive standard feed regimen addition extra milk fortification give high protein diet . Based amount protein milk , fortification feed donor human milk derive fortifier , number adjust reach average 4.2 4.5 g/kg/day . Data record milk analysis , nutrition , infant growth . The diet continue approximately 35 36 week postmenstrual age ( PMA ) point DXA scan perform . Infants 3 set labs study purpose . A serum Blood Urea Nitrogen ( BUN ) creatinine perform 2-3 day 1 week goal protein achieve . At time DXA scan , serum calcium , phosphorus , alkaline phosphatase perform . Anthropometrics : weekly weight , length , head circumference train research nurse . Human Milk Samples : A 2.5 mL sample batch human milk analyze use milk analyzer . This analyzer use secondary method measurement . It calibrate bias sample primary method . Tests : DXA scan use evaluate body composition provide measure bone mineral , lean fat mass . Labs : BUN ; creatinine , calcium , phosphorus , alkaline phosphatase obtain time DXA scan measure bone mineral status . Sample Size : Based admission data institution , approximately 120 infant &lt; 1000 gram admit NICU year . A project 50 % eligible subject enroll study . Recruitment goal 50 subject group ( n=100 ) additional 10 subject per group account drop provide total sample size 120 infant . This would provide 89 % statistical power detect 15 % difference ( hypothesize infant receive high protein ) length velocity ( two side ) 5 % significance level . Study Population : Infants recruit Level 3 NICU ( Texas Children 's Hospital ) admit inborn premature infant . Enrolled infant randomize either ( control group intervention group ) . Infants usually within range birth weight , gestational age ethnicity . Male female usually close 50 % . The investigator recruit specific ethnicity gender part inclusion criterion . Study Duration : Infants study time consent 35 - 36 week postmenstrual age .</detailed_description>
