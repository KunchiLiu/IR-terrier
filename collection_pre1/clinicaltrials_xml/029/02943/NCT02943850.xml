	<brief_summary>The investigator examine safety transplant cell engineer produce growth factor spinal cord patient Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis ( ALS ) . The cell call neural progenitor cell , type stem cell become several different type cell nervous system . These cell derive specifically become astrocyte , type neuronal cell . The growth factor call glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor , GDNF . GDNF protein promote survival many type neuronal cell . Therefore , cell call `` CNS10-NPC-GDNF . '' The investigational treatment test animal , yet test people . In study , want learn CNS10-NPC-GDNF cell safe transplant spinal cord people .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study first use genetically modify progenitor cell treat neurodegenerative disease . This Phase 1/2a , single-center , blind ( side injection ) , safety study two escalate dos human neural progenitor cell express GDNF ( CNS10-NPC-GDNF ) deliver unilaterally lumbar region ALS subject moderate leg involvement . Subjects meet Eligibility Criteria provide Informed Consent enrol one two sequential dose group . Subjects treat sequentially minimum one month interval surgery first three subject dose cohort . The remain subject cohort treat minimum interval least two week surgery . Specific aim : Safety , evaluate : - Adverse Events Serious Adverse Events - Clinical laboratory assessment , clinically indicate ( hematology , chemistry , immunology )</detailed_description>
