	<brief_summary>The purpose research study test whether drug ibrutinib ( trademark name : IMBRUVICA® ) effective preventing development multiple myeloma people currently smolder myeloma . The researcher conduct trial ) reason believe ibrutinib delay development multiple myeloma , thus give people currently smolder myeloma long period time feel healthy well . Smoldering myeloma abnormal condition consider early phase disease multiple myeloma . In disorder , abnormal growth plasma cell , type blood cell find bone marrow . This growth severe people smolder myeloma multiple myeloma , people smolder myeloma symptom tend feel well . However , high risk develop multiple myeloma people general population . Some people smolder myeloma especially high risk develop myeloma - 50 % people develop multiple myeloma 2 year diagnose smolder myeloma . The investigator identify people look amount myeloma bone marrow ( call `` bone marrow plasma cell percentage '' ) amount myeloma protein ( call `` serum protein electrophoresis '' `` serum free light chain assay '' ) blood . To consider high risk , individual must highly abnormal level test . Based upon current guideline , people smolder myeloma require treatment . However , know many people develop multiple myeloma near future . Currently proven effective way prevent people develop multiple myeloma , remain incurable disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Effect Ibrutinib High Risk Smoldering Multiple Myeloma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase 2 , open-label , single center , prospective pilot study design ass efficacy ibrutinib subject high risk smolder multiple myeloma . All enrolled subject treat ibrutinib 560 mg ( 4 capsule , contain 140 mg ) take PO daily 12 cycle ( 28 day ) . If subject demonstrate benefit ibrutinib , therapy may extend beyond 12 cycle maximum 2 year . Subjects progress meet criterion symptomatic multiple myeloma withdrawn study . An initial cohort 15 subject accrue . If 4 patient progress symptomatic myeloma one year , study review FDA determine whether employ high dose ibrutinib , stop futility . Otherwise , 21 additional patient accrue total sample size 36 .</detailed_description>
