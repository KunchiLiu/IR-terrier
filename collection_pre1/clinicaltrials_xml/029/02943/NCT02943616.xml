	<detailed_description>After approval commercial use Absorb GT1 Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold ( BVS ) System 75 country December 31 , 2015 , Abbott Vascular develop post-approval commitment plan include initiation ABSORB Post-Approval Clinical Study , single-arm trial include approximately 3000 subject approximately 265 site US Canada . The objective ABSORB PostApproval Study follow : - Evaluate safety use Absorb real world set follow commercial physician training . - Observe effectiveness commercial physician train appropriate vessel size use Absorb real world setting . The study design allow evaluate low frequency event , effectiveness commercial physician train education small vessel ( &lt; 2.25 mm assess quantitative coronary angiography ( QCA ) ) , confirmation generalizability treatment Absorb real-world practice . The clinical followup occur 30 day , 180 day , 1 year , 2 year 3 year investigator designee telephone contact office visit . Angiographic Subgroup : Approximately first 500 consecutive subject implant operator inexperienced usage Absorb GT1 BVS receive baseline assessment reference vessel diameter ( RVD ) angiographic core laboratory . An inexperienced operator define perform two few Absorb implant prior commercial approval . The purpose angiographic subgroup evaluate effectiveness train selection appropriately size coronary artery GT1 BVS implantation . Study staff notify procedure subject angiographic subgroup , instructed send pre-procedure angiogram support material core laboratory assessment .</detailed_description>
