	<brief_summary>Unwarranted use antibiotic pediatric acute respiratory tract infection ( ARTIs ) use second-line , broad spectrum antibiotic bacterial ARTIs contribute rapid development resistance many strain bacteria . Provider-parent communication pediatric visit ARTIs strongly influence antibiotic prescribing rate . The overall goal study develop test distance learn quality improvement ( QI ) program call Dialogue Around Respiratory Illness Treatment - DART . The DART program aim improve provider communication practice treatment decision pediatric ARTI visit , ultimate goal decrease rate antibiotic prescribing illness child .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Antibiotic prescribing childhood ARTIs , include acute otitis medium ( AOM ) , sinusitis , bronchitis , upper respiratory infection ( URI ) , pharyngitis common United States . An estimated 31.7 million visit respiratory condition result antibiotic prescription annually , account &gt; 70 % outpatient visit antibiotic prescribed child . Current national level antibiotic prescribe ARTIs appear excessive give estimate prevalence infection cause bacterial pathogen child . While number study early 2000 's indicated inappropriate antibiotic prescribing may peak 1990 's decline prescribing rate primarily drive decrease rate office visit ARTIs decrease prescribe case antibiotic rarely need ( i.e. , acute nasopharyngitis , laryngitis , URI , bronchitis , bronchiolitis , viral pneumonia , influenza ) . For patient present presumed bacterial ARTIs ( i.e. , AOM , sinusitis , Group A Streptococcal ( GAS ) pharyngitis , non-viral pneumonia ) , overall prescribing rate remain stable decade span 1995 2006 second-line antibiotic prescribing increase . This occur despite recent development treatment guideline outline first- second-line alternative treatment bacterial ARTIs . Between 1995 2006 , prescription rate azithromycin ( second-line agent ) ARTIs increase almost 9-fold child &lt; 5 years-old . Similarly , child ≥5 years-old , azithromycin fluoroquinolone prescription rate increase approximately 6- 5-fold , respectively . During time period , use amoxicillin , first-line agent ARTIs , decrease 37 % child &lt; 5 years-old 49 % ≥5 years-old ARTIs . Furthermore , widely accept episode bronchitis URI child cause viral pathogen antibiotic treatment alter course diseases prevent future bacterial infection . Overuse antibiotic condition contributes increase resistance among many strain bacteria commonly cause ARTIs , pose risk individual community level . The large number annual visit pediatric ARTIs frequency antibiotic prescribe visit make ARTIs important target effort reduce antibiotic overuse .</detailed_description>
