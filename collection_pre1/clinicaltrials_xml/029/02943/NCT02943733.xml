	<brief_summary>The goal study establish maximum tolerate doses/recommended phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) temozolomide ( TMZ ) TAS-102 agent use combination evaluate safety profile drug combination .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety TAS-102 Combination With Temozolomide Metastatic Pancreatic NETs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study two part phase 1B clinical trial consist three study period : screening period 14 day less , treatment period , safety follow-up period 30 day treatment discontinuation . Part 1 dose find phase objective ass safety tolerability propose drug combination identify maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) recommend phase 2 dose . Part 2 open-label expansion study , enroll patient metastatic pNETs previously treat chemotherapy . Part 2 obtain safety data propose drug combination .</detailed_description>
