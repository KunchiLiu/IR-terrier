	<brief_summary>The primary aim trial investigate adipose tissue function woman without polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) . PCOS common endocrine disorder young woman . The pathogenesis behind PCOS complex partly understood , deep mechanistic insight need . Insulin resistance central feature PCOS , recent study suggest link aberrant adipose tissue function . Exercise training find improve symptom PCOS , need knowledge . While process involve skeletal muscle oxidative remodel well describe , large extent unknown whether oxidative capacity human adipose tissue modify endurance training . The woman include study match ( body mass index , body weight , age ) participants another study . This enable investigator comparison case ( woman PCOS ) control ( woman without PCOS ) baseline , assess response exercise train adipose tissue .</brief_summary>
