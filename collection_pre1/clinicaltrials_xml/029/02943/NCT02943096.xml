	<brief_summary>The goal proposal conduct first pilot study whether consume flavanol supplement augment cognitive mood benefit antidepressant medication old adult Late LifeDepression ( LLD ) . Flavanols represent specific group plant derive nutrient find cocoa bean , grape , tea , berry various fruit vegetable . The specific flavanols investigate study come cocoa . Currently available treatment LLD ( i.e. , antidepressant medication ) limit efficacy , especially individual also suffer cognitive impairment . Recent study perform Columbia elsewhere suggest flavanols may induce beneficial brain change support cognitive functioning elevate mood , precise clinical effect older adult combine depression cognitive impairment remain evaluate . For study , investigator plan recruit 50 adult age ≥60 year Major Depressive Disorder , meet minimum depressive symptom threshold despite currently receive adequate trial antidepressant , significant cognitive complaint without diagnosis dementia . Subjects randomize receive 8 week augmentation treatment flavanol capsule ( addition continue antidepressant ) vs. capsule contain flavanols . Pre- post-treatment MRI scan brain conduct , comprehensive pre- post-treatment neuropsychological assessment perform . Results project allow investigator evaluate novel therapeutic approach LLD , could large public health ramification give prevalence , frequent treatment resistance , chronicity characteristic LLD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The goal proposal conduct first pilot study whether consume diet high flavanols augment cognitive mood benefit antidepressant medication old adult Late Life Depression ( LLD ) . LLD affect 3 % community-dwelling adult 60 year old , 15 % old adult live community clinically significant depressive symptom . Diagnosis LLD increase old adult 's risk disability 67-73 % 6 year follow , cause twice functional impairment compare without LLD , associate high rate complete suicide individual 65 . Currently available treatment LLD ( i.e. , antidepressant medication ) limit efficacy , leading high rate recurrence frequent development chronicity . Cognitive impairment , commonly associate LLD , predict poor acute response antidepressant , lead high relapse rate continuation phase treatment , associate development adverse age-related health outcome , include increase risk dementia , dependence activity daily live ( ADL ) , drive cessation . Novel treatment address LLD 's underlying neurobiology critically need , particularly therapy may also beneficial effect cognitive component LLD . The extensively studied brain region implicate depressive cognitive aspect LLD hippocampus . Decreased hippocampal volume find depressed patient compare control , find appear particularly pronounced individual recurrent depressive illness . Among subregions comprise hippocampus , evidence suggests decrease neurogenesis within dentate gyrus ( DG ) specifically may contribute development depression , appear part mechanism action antidepressant enhance neurogenesis DG . As DG also critical contributor cognitive function hippocampus , stand highly significant brain region may involve mood cognitive component LLD .</detailed_description>
