	<brief_summary>Chronic liver disease end liver cirrhosis increase risk cancer development . Chronic liver disease Egypt recognize serious health problem affect great ( 20 % ) population , main cause chronic infection . Liver transplantation still standard treatment advance decompensated liver cirrhosis . However , treatment quite limited clinical practice . Therefore concerted effort around world develop regenerative alternative therapy , , stem cell-based therapy emerge new alternative liver transplantation end-stage liver pathology .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stem Cell Transplantation Cirrhotic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study aim transplant autologous bone marrow derive mesenchymal stem cell patient liver cirrhosis ass liver tissue regeneration , efficacy safety stem cell therapy finally establish alternative treatment modality liver transplantation . Medical treatment liver cirrhosis ( last stage illness ) difficult lead high morbidity mortality rate . Liver transplantation still effective treatment patient liver cirrhosis , However , serious problem accompany liver transplantation , donor shortage , long wait list , high cost , risk rejection , operative complication complication related immunosuppressive drug . `` stem cell '' cell human body capable renew differentiate diverse range specialize cell type differentiate specialized cell appropriate medias laboratory . In recent year , advance stem cell biology , make prospect tissue regeneration potential clinical reality , several study show great promise stem cell hold therapy . mesenchymal stem cell base therapy show promising tool cirrhotic condition type cell ability differentiate different cell type include hepatocytes A series study perform assess application bone marrow derive mesenchymal stem cell promote liver regeneration alleviate cirrhosis . Some animal-based study show stem cell transplantation could ameliorate liver fibrosis improve liver function follow several clinical trial human , patient advance liver disease , study demonstrate stem cell transplantation could significantly reverse hepatic failure limited side effect . However , effectiveness therapy recent clinical trial still conflict need evaluation .</detailed_description>
