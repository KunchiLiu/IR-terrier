	<brief_summary>Nearly 70 % people live cancer `` complex patient '' multiple chronic condition must deal effect cancer also continue disease diabetes , depression , hypertension , heart disease . Care coordination strategy show effective improving outcomes common medical condition see primary care include : systematic transition patient specialty care ; intensive case management ; team-based approach comprehensive care . Despite Institute Medicine report suggest strategy potential way improve care cancer survivor , implementation yet evaluate cancer survivor . Parkland Health Hospital Systems implement care coordinator strategy part quality assurance/quality improvement activity , Aim 2 Aim 3 ( research component ) evaluate . This protocol organize reflect distinction aim . The investigator expect 1500 patient include study aim .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Care Coordination Complex Cancer Survivors Integrated Safety Net System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project pragmatic trial . The investigator propose quasi-experimental design data collect pre- post-intervention distinct cross-sections patient one highly prevalent ambulatory-sensitive chronic condition ( diabetes , hypertension , chronic lung disease , chronic kidney disease , depression , heart disease ) newly diagnose breast , colorectal , gynecologic cancer ( complex cancer survivor ) Parkland Health &amp; Hospital system ( Dallas , TX ) . Guided `` Primary Care Change Model '' , Parkland implement evidence-based care coordination strategy improve care complex cancer survivor integrate safety-net system part quality assurance/quality improvement activity ( Aim 1 ) , study comprehensively evaluate strategy implement safety-net setting ( Aim 3 ) , whether implement strategy improve care coordination care outcome ( Aim 2 ) within Parkland Health Hospital System . Investigators expect approximately 1000 new survivor â‰¥ 1 prevalent chronic condition eligible . The project include patient diagnosed situ metastatic disease ( Stages 0 IV ) due insufficient evidence routine follow-up management ; many latter continue indefinitely active treatment symptom management . The chronic condition select inclusion prevalent condition cancer survivor Parkland well nationally . - Aim 1 : ( Quality Assurance/ Improvement ) Implement system-level EMR-driven intervention approximately 1000 complex cancer survivor Parkland , combine three evidence-based care coordination strategy ; ( 1 ) EMR-driven registry facilitate patient transition primary care oncology care , ( 2 ) co-locate nurse practitioner train care coordination within complex care team , ( 3 ) enhance teamwork coach technical assistance ; - Aim 2 : ( Research component ) Test effectiveness strategy system- patient-level outcome use rigorous , quasi-experimental design outcome measure implementation ; - Aim 3 : ( Research Component ) Elucidate system patient factor facilitate hind implementation result difference experience care coordination complex patient without cancer . Investigators collect quantitative ( EMR data , patient survey ) qualitative ( structured observation , patient provider interview , EMR audit ) data throughout .</detailed_description>
