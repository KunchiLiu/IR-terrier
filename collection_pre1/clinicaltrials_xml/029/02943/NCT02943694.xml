	<brief_summary>Colorectal cancer one lead deadly diseases world . Due TME ( total mesorectal excision ) last decade , survival relapse rate rectal cancer patient considerably improve . However , anatomical limitation pelvic space hinder optimization surgical treatment Thus , natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery ( NOTES ) emerge alternative surgical strategy . Of note , transanal total mesorectal excision ( TaTME ) , new invention base TME principle , NOTES conception single port technique , prevail West East nation , without abdominal laparoscopic assistance . Up date , various kind instrument pattern complete TaTME comparable clinical outcome . However , flaws instrument remain accord feedback . This study therefore design clinically evaluate feasibility safety new instrument specifically TaTME ( CS-Compact , GelPoint pathway ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Feasibility Safety Instruments Transanal Total Mesorectal Excision ( TaTME ) Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rectal cancer comprise colorectal cancer around world , among surgery remain optimal therapeutic intervention . The TME ( Total Mesorectal Excision ) , propose Bill Heald , provide novel insight eradication possible disseminated cancer cell therefore reduces recurrence mortality rate . However , either laparoscopic open TME surgery limit pelvic space improvement . For last decade , emerge natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery ( NOTES ) offer alternative pattern rectal cancer surgery , among , TaTME ( transanal total mesorectal excision ) represent optimized surgery technique . Derived TME , NOTES modify laparoscopic instrument , TaTME facilitate dissection process rectal cancer caudal cranial , indirect direct vision . TaTME allow accurate confirmation resect margin proper transect level , good dissection mesorectum protection sphincter , qualify end-to-end anastomosis reduce need endolinear stapler possible leakage afterwards . However , various kind instrument surgical procedure propose complete TaTME , validate preclinical clinical trial small size . Of note , study initiate apply suit instrument specifically design TaTME ( GelPoint pathway CS-Compact ) clinically evaluate feasibility safety new instrument without comparison prevail one . The CS-Compact GelPoint pathway confirm safe feasible operate preclinical trial clinical trial western . This study strictly examine correspond issue Chinese rectal cancer patient . The surgeon institute successfully complete training program TaTME preclinical trial , animal model cadaver . Clinical skill knowledge safe operation qualify .</detailed_description>
