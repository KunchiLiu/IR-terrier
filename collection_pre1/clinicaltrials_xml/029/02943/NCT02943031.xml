	<brief_title>The Effect Individualized Precision Therapy Programs Patients With BTC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In prospective cohort study , patient eligible inclusion criterion enroll study . After bile duct tumor sample collect , whole genome sequencing , drug screening ( include Mini-PDX PDX ) conduct . Suitable drug decide accord different genomics classification , develop individualized precise treatment program . The investigator hope achieve follow objective : ① Through establishment Individualized Precision Therapy Programs improve overall survival bile duct malignancy ( BTC ) ； ② To study molecular type prognosis biliary malignancy ; ③ To construct database BTC gene bank , well drug screen information .</detailed_description>
