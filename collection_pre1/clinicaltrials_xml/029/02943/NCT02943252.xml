	<brief_title>The Clinical Study Apatinib Plus S1 Patients With Advanced Non-squamous Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There standard therapy patient advance ( unresectable , locally advanced , recurrent metastatic ) non-squamous head neck cancer . Apatinib novel vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor , approve treatment patient advance gastric cancer refractory two line prior chemotherapy . Vascular endothelial growth factor highly express non-squamous head neck cancer expression correlate stage , tumour size , vascular invasion , recurrence metastasis . S1 new kind oral fluorouracil antineoplastic chemotherapy drug . In vitro , apatinib synergy effect fluorouracil . In study , investigator try evaluate efficacy safety apatinib S1 advance non-squamous head neck cancer validate correlative biomarkers .</detailed_description>
