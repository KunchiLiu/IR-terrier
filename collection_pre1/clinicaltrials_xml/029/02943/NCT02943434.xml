	<brief_summary>This study examine difference diet-induced thermogenesis ( DIT ) meal make processed ingredient equivalent , isocaloric meal make whole ingredient . For purpose study process food ( PFs ) consider purchased state modify whole food ( WF ) counterpart ( e.g . shell egg compare powdered egg ) . Research show less energy expend digest process food whole food , confers advantage process food term caloric efficiency , disadvantage term energy balance weight loss . A 2010 study show subject expend approximately 10 % less energy digest sandwich make white bread cheese product compare sandwich make whole grain bread cheddar cheese . The intent study enhance result improve upon study design construct meal similar makeup individual ingredient , make ingredient processing isolate variable . Subjects healthy CWU male student body mass index 18.5 - 24.9 kg/m2 . Metabolism assess repeat measurement rest energy expenditure via indirect calorimetry . Measurements baseline metabolism make ; subject provide one two meal , comprise rice , green bean , egg cook canola oil equivalent differ processing status ( e.g . brown rice white rice , fresh cook green bean can green bean , etc ) . Hourly metabolic measurement make post-meal 6 hour . During time subject ask minimize non-DIT deviation metabolism ; e.g . due physical activity , excitement level , etc . The procedure repeat one week later meal change DIT assess subject-by-subject basis . The result study assessed lens weight loss , specifically dietary choice affect energy balance . It possible consume diet include whole food ( versus process food ) would beneficial attainment healthy body weight - either potential weight loss weight maintenance .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study crossover design use indirect calorimetry ass change metabolic rate twelve healthy subject prescreened know metabolic abnormality . Subjects recruit healthy CWU male student normal BMI range express interest research study participation . Subjects assign either meal make whole ingredient ( whole grain brown rice , unrefined canola oil , scramble egg shell , freshly-steamed green bean ) one make process ingredient ( white rice , canola oil-based margarine , scramble egg powdered mix , can green bean ) . Subjects basal metabolic rate ( BMR ) measurement take ingest meal DIT measure hourly basis post meal . PROCEDURE : Early Meal Preparation : Meal preparation begin night prior test session cook 2 cup dry rice per package instruction chill shallow stainless steel pan . This rice refrigerate overnight re-heated portion-by-portion follow morning 's meal feeding . Three portion one cup 's worth fresh green bean also wash , trim , cut one-inch piece , refrigerate . Initial Testing : Two subject assessed per day . Subjects report lab total two day ( approximately 8 hour day ) one week apart baseline metabolic measurement , meal feeding , series post-meal metabolic measurement . Measurements take 30 minute complete , include time calibration individual prior measurement time clean prepare assessment equipment next subject . Subjects arrive thirty minute stagger schedule interval morning ( see propose example schedule attach ) . At least three day prior initial test subject provide three-day diet intake record complete subject three day prior initial test . Instructions correct completion three day diet record give subject provide three day record ( please see attach ; diet record modify use permission Colorado Clinical Translational Sciences Instituteâ€” [ see attached email ] ) . At time subject re-briefed pre-test protocol provide instruction set use heart rate monitor . The three day record review subject day data collection completeness accuracy . Pre-test protocol : Protein great effect metabolism macronutrients , intake limit recommended daily allowance .8 g protein per kg body weight3 even prior testing ; macronutrient micronutrient intake consume discretion subject . No intake caloric content consume point even 12 hour prior test ( approximately 7 PM ) . Subjects ask abstain alcohol , marijuana , caffeine use night day test . Subjects ask refrain strenuous physical activity two day test restrain light physical activity day test . Upon awaken morning testing , subject activate MyZone MZ-3 heart rate monitor consume 500 mL supply bottled water . Subjects report lab , expend little energy possible ( drive instead walking , take elevator instead stair , etc ) . Resting Phase BMR : Upon arrive test site , subject provide 30 minute period brief procedure , allow urinate defecate need , rest baseline testing . A ParvoMedics TrueOne 2400 Metabolic Measuring System ( MMS ) use determine metabolic rate use dilution method outline manual ( see attach ) . At begin 30 minute BMR test period subject lie face assessment table allow get comfortable fit measurement hood . The flow rate MMS dilution pump calibrate subject . During measurement , subject instruct lie still eye close breathe normally . Immediate Meal Preparation : Whole Food Meals Bring one quart water boil medium pot . Heat 2 Tbsp unrefined canola oil medium heat skillet . Beat 3 large shell egg together cup add directly skillet , cook stir egg fluffy set ( 3-5 minute ) . During time , place 1 cup cut green bean metal strainer , set boiling water , cover lid 3 minute . Place 1.5 cup precook brown rice plate microwave 1.5 minute , allow stand 2 minute ensure even heat . Add cook egg green bean plate , scrape oil rice spatula . Cover plate lid deliver test site . Microwave meal 30 second immediately serve . Processed Food Meals : Drain rinse 1 cup can green bean . Heat 2 Tbsp canola-based margarine medium heat skillet . Prepare 3 egg ' worth powder egg mix per package instruction add directly skillet , cook stir egg fluffy set ( 3-5 minute ) . During time , place 1.5 cup precook white rice 1 cup green bean plate microwave 1.5 minute , allow stand 2 minute ensure even heat . Add cook eggs plate , scrape oil rice spatula . Cover plate lid deliver test site . Microwave meal 30 second immediately serve . Note : Meal ingredient amount may change base average energy need subject ( e.g . 1 cup rice instead 1.5 , etc ) . Both meal adjust keep isocaloric . Meal Feeding Rest : Subjects serve one type meal assessment session , meal one week later second assessment . Meals serve immediately BMR measurement complete . Subjects ask consume entire meal provide 30 minute . Following completion meal , subject ask remain onsite instructed lie sit quietly rest first DIT measurement take place . During meal completion day 's testing , subject permit consume water . A graduated water bottle provide record water intake . DIT Measurement Rest : DIT assess fashion BMR . The first DIT reading take place one hour begin BMR measurement . Afterwards , subject ask remain onsite instructed rest . Subjects may lie sit quietly , engage non-physical activity induce psychological stress excitement . This include limited : use bathroom , reading , complete homework , watch appropriate movie , talk quietly , etc . DIT measurement take hourly basis six hour metabolism return base level . No intake except water permit day 's measurement complete . Data Analysis : All subject assign study ID number data collect identifiable study ID number . Only primary investigator access participant 's contact information assure confidentiality . Summary statistic ( mean , standard deviation , range , proportion ) calculate baseline demographic characteristic ( see attach questionnaire ) . Three-day diet record information enter ESHA Food Processor Software quantitative analysis macronutrient intake perform . Data MSM transfer Microsoft Excel spreadsheet repeat measure t-tests perform metabolic statistic subject . A p-value &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant .</detailed_description>
