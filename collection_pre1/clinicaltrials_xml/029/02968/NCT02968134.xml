	<brief_summary>The purpose study try find critically ill patient receive anti fungal medication , posaconazole , process body . Investigators would like study recommend dos posaconazole achieve adequate concentration patient blood treat fungal infections.The disease process critically ill patient profoundly influence concentration anti fungal medication blood . The process drug travel body blood , broken remove body call pharmacokinetics ( PK ) . This information important know antifungal level low blood , fungal infection opportunity become resistant antifungal medication lead medication less effective fungal infection potentially exposing future patient infection limit range effective antifungal . Investigators measure PK take blood sample specific time anti fungal medication give . This study enroll 8 patient admit intensive care unit treat antifungal medication fungal infection . Patients consent give single dose posaconazole serial blood sample collect prior dose 15 , 45,75 minute infusion 3 , 5 , 8 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 30 36 48 hour . Information patient stay ICU also collect include blood pressure , temperature , blood test result .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Posaconazole new extend spectrum triazole active range yeast mold include Aspergillus , Candida , Coccidioides , Cryptococcus neoformans , Fusarium , Zygomycetes . It may use prevention invasive fungal infection immunocompromised patient include febrile neutropenic patient receive immunosuppressant drug graft-vs-host disease stem cell transplantation . It may also use treatment systemic fungal infections.The use posaconazole ICU patient limit stable patient ensure reliable bioavailability oral formulation . Oral formulation important limitation use critically ill patient may unable take oral dos bioavailability may compromise due erratic absorption . Recently , intravenous ( IV ) formulation develop address limitation . Initial pharmacokinetic ( PK ) investigation IV formulation conduct hematology patient , data patient population still forthcoming ; particularly critically ill IV formulation would probably use frequently . Most available PK data posaconazole non-critically ill patient receive oral formulation . Although absorption phase kinetics relevant IV formulation , data distribution , metabolism elimination property would still informative IV kinetics . The tissue distribution posaconazole extensive large volume distribution owe high lipophilicity . It highly bound plasma protein ( 98-99 % ) therefore likely affect variable change plasma protein concentration critically ill patient . The major elimination pathway posaconazoleis biliary excretion ( 77 % ) mainly unchanged parent compound rest renal execration glucuronide conjugate . A number study describe PK variability posaconazole due alter absorption/bioavailability frequently result sub-therapeutic plasma concentration , form strong case therapeutic drug monitoring . Nonetheless , unclear whether observed low concentration also explain , least part , factor disease-related PK change obvious plausibility alter absorption mask investigation . Most population PK model describe far base one compartment model , reveal observe variability concentration due change PK parameter volume distribution clearance . The influence disease state PK parameter extensively describe several antimicrobial critically ill patient population . Although data new IV formulation posaconazole patient population lacking , evidence previous PK study oral formulation PK variability observe healthy study participant observe patient invasive fungal infection , although explain primarily relation alter bioavailability oral formulation . In surgical ICU patient low plasma concentration posaconazole observe , administration via nasogastric tube . Similar finding report general ICU patient . Although explanation report irregular absorption , influence pathologic change remain investigated . A PK evaluation IV posaconazole critically ill patient , confound absorption factor , would reveal pathophysiology-induced PK alteration . Such study also give insight dose-exposure relationship optimal treatment regimen .</detailed_description>
