	<brief_summary>The purpose study demonstrate young plasma infusion perform safely patient Parkinson 's Disease ( PD ) . Secondary outcome include behavioral laboratory data support next study inquire whether young plasma infusion improve slow progression cognitive , mood and/or motor impairment rate marker disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) neurodegenerative disease affect 1.6 million people United States whose incidence increase age , affect 1 % people age 65 . The neuropathological process involve PD widespread throughout brain , reflect constellation motor , cognitive , mood non-motor symptom . Treatments date largely focused dopamine replacement strategy deep brain stimulation , symptomatic treatment . As neurodegenerative disease progress , major change throughout body brain . These change transmit body via circulatory system organ , tissue cell . Recent finding multiple laboratory show infusion young plasma age rodent beneficial effect cognitive function . This suggest circulate component plasma improve cognitive disease-relevant symptom . This motivated field treat multiple disorder blood product constituent active component . The establish safety blood transfusion allow investigator test whether infusion young plasma ease neurological symptom human subject neurodegenerative disease . A study ongoing Stanford , department Neurology Neurological Sciences , test whether infusion young plasma ameliorate cognitive impairment patient Alzheimer 's disease ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02256306 ) . To date , well-tolerated participant , without major adverse effect . The investigator propose test safety efficacy transfuse young plasma PD participant , order establish effect motor cognitive function participant Phase 1 study . The successful completion study inform design future , large multicenter study goal determine whether infusion young plasma ameliorate neurodegenerative symptom underlie pathophysiology Parkinson 's disease .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>A diagnosis clinically probable establish Parkinson 's Disease ( MDS criterion ) Subject must stable dose dopaminergic medication and/or Deep Brain Stimulation ( DBS ) parameter least 4 week prior screen duration study Subject must competent sign consent Subject must willing commit available weekly infusion test 4 consecutive week ( 8 week subject agrees longer study ) . The availability study partner know patient well willing accompany subject trial The participation interventional clinical trial The inability travel Stanford Inability walk without assistance medication state The clinically determine presence dementia A clinical suspicion/diagnosis Multiple System Atrophy ( MSA ) , Progressive Supranuclear Palsy ( PSP ) , Lewy Body Dementia ( LBD ) , Essential Tremor ( ET ) Subject 's pregnancy likelihood pregnancy within next 6 month . Subject 's positive test result Hepatitis B , Hepatitis C HIV screen Any condition situation investigator believe may interfere safety subject intent conduct study Subject 's medical history : Stroke Anaphylaxis Gout may cause increase uric acid Prior adverse reaction human blood product Any history blood coagulation disorder hypercoagulability Congestive heart failure Uncontrolled hypertension Renal failure Prior intolerance intravenous fluid Recent history uncontrolled atrial fibrillation immunoglobulin A deficiency ( history ) Subject 's relation medication treatment : Any concurrent use anticoagulant therapy . Antiplatelet drug ( e.g. , aspirin clopidogrel ) acceptable . The use Inosine , may alter urate level Initiation change dosage cholinesterase inhibitor memantine trial . A participant already cholinesterase inhibitor memantine must stable dose least one month prior Screening . Concurrent participation another interventional treatment trial Parkinson 's disease . If prior participation , last dose investigational agent must least 6 month prior Screening . Treatment human blood product , include intravenous immunoglobulin , 6 month prior Screening trial . Concurrent daily treatment benzodiazepine , typical atypical antipsychotic , longacting opioids , medication , investigator 's opinion , interfere cognition . Intermittent treatment shortacting benzodiazepine atypical antipsychotic may permit , provide dose administer within 72 hour precede cognitive assessment .</criteria>
