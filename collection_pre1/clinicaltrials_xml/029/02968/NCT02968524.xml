	<brief_summary>This project focus test accuracy ThermoSpot -a low-cost , color-based , temperature indicator estimate body temperature Nigerian baby expose ambient temperature condition . The particpants recruit among baby receive Filtered Sunlight Phototherapy ( FSPT ) Bowen University Teaching Hospital , Ogbomoso baby nursery Bowen University Teaching Hospital . There also educational session teach health worker mother sign hypothermia hyperthermia indicator . Then , investigator collect observational cross-sectional data random day see many trained health worker mother able accurately recognize provide appropriate response warn sign indicator .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>ThermoSpot liquid crystal display thermometer . It come sticky disc ( 12mm diameter ) apply skin liver , armpit , neck blood vessel infant . ThermoSpot design non-invasive hypothermia indicator infant . The device change color baby 's core body temperature change , allow understood even non-literate parent . It test proven accurately detect hypothermia Malawi , Nepal India . However , large-scale study perform baby expose ambient temperature long period FSPT . The main objective project determine whether ThermoSpot use detect hypothermia hyperthermia baby receive FSPT instead thermometer . The ability parent respond timely manner temperature indicator help provide critical information technical , well educational component require FSPT scale-up Nigeria resource-limited country health worker shortage . Specific objectives 1 . Compare performance ThermoSpot detection hypothermia hyperthermia standard axillary thermometer measurement . 2 . Determine parent able correctly interpret color indicator ThermoSpot 3 . Determine whether parent carry appropriate action base ThermoSpot indicator .</detailed_description>
