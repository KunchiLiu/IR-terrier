	<brief_summary>The objectives/specific aim study three-fold . First , study seek evaluate safety fecal microbiota transplant ( FMT ) patient severe , complicate C. difficile infection ( scCDI ) . Second , study seek evaluate whether fecal microbiota transplant ( FMT ) improve scCDI , `` improve '' define either decrease severity CDI , resolve infection altogether . Third , study seek study mechanism FMT improve course scCDI perform 16S rRNA ITS sequence pre-FMT serial post-FMT stool sample order measure change bacterial fungal microbiota consequence CDI FMT therapy . FMT material ( hereafter refer FMTm ) would obtain OpenBiome . FMTm prepare prescreened healthy donor .

The hypothesis study FMT prefer salvage therapy scCDI compare ( 1 ) ongoing , fail medical therapy conventional antibiotic ( 2 ) surgery . The standard care treatment scCDI conventional antibiotic either parenteral/oral metronidazole , and/or vancomycin provide form oral and/or retention enema . The reliability conventional antibiotic set scCDI unpredictable , patient CDI severity mortality rate series great 50 % . It mediocre historical record antibiotic FMT would test highly moribund patient population . FMT would provide patient scCDI protocol .</detailed_description>
