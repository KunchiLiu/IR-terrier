	<brief_summary>﻿﻿Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) cardiac condition result patient experience irregular heart beat result symptom include palpitation breathlessness . It known case , AF cause abnormal electrical activity top leave side heart ( left atrium ) override heart natural pacemaker right atrium . Treatment option include tablet suppress abnormal electrical activity , patient sufficient procedure carry area abnormal electrical activity disconnect 'ablated ' prevent AF occur . This treatment well establish perform worldwide , often general anaesthetic ( GA ) . The heart lungs sit close together chest , lung inflate deflated procedure , heart also move . This movement transmit special wire 'catheters ' place inside heart deliver ablation treatment . Instability treatment result ineffective area ablation may later contribute reduce success procedure . Previous research show reduce movement heart anaesthesia use alternative technique improve catheter stability improve procedural result . Once technique call high frequency jet ventilation ( HFJV ) allow lung fill air use fast shallow breath result normal blood oxygen level little movement heart . This technique show safe effective procedure direct comparison conventional ventilation do . The investigator wish test determine use HFJV improve outcome procedure ( i.e . investigator treatment faster effectively ) translate well outcome long term .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>﻿Catheter ablation treatment symptom fibrillation well-established technique . The technique complex commonly undertaken general anaesthesia . Catheters introduce circulation vein top leg advance right side heart . Using x-ray ultrasound guidance , catheter pass left atrium puncture muscle divide leave right atrium ( septum ) . A model leave atrium create use guide movement ablation catheter across tissue create ablation lesion lead electrical isolation target site . Under general anaesthesia , lung inflate deflated via ventilator circuit . The expansion lung result movement heart respiratory cycle . This lead catheter instability tissue move towards away catheter position leave atrium . This movement particularly mark back left atrium . This instability lead real time variation delivery energy result ineffective lesion . These translate acutely incomplete isolation need ablation ( thereby increase procedure time ) later reconnection tissue result repeat procedure need achieve effective outcome . Each procedure carry risk minor major complication therefore measure improve first time success critical . Current research support use steerable catheter sheath ( tubes catheter travel atrium ) 3 dimensional mapping improve ablation parameter . Data also exist demonstrate significant variation catheter contact despite measure . In order improve catheter stability , change mode ventilation study . Small study show stop cardiac movement altogether transiently stop ventilation ( apnoea ) catheter stability improve ablation effective . However , intermittent apnoea effective method ventilation long case . An alternative high frequency jet ventilation . This lung ventilate low volume , high speed high pressure breath . This technique well establish safety data upper airway surgery liver radiology procedure movement airways diaphragm need minimize . In view , technique study AF ablation show improve catheter stability energy delivery increase complication related mode ventilation . However , exist study focus mainly paroxysmal AF patient ( less ablation need ) conduct non randomize trial design . The investigator wish research use HFJV patient undergo ablation persistent AF prospective randomise trial answer primary secondary question show .</detailed_description>
