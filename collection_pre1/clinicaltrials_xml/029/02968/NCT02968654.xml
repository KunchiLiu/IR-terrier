	<detailed_description>Although blood transfusion lifesaving severe hemorrhage , also potential complication . As anemia also associate poor outcome critically ill patient , determine optimal transfusion trigger real challenge clinician . This even important patient acute brain injury specifically evaluate previous large randomize clinical trial deal optimal transfusion threshold . Neurological patient may particularly sensitive anemic brain hypoxia exhaust cerebrovascular reserve , adjust cerebral blood flow tissue oxygen demand . This prospective , multicenter , randomize , pragmatic trial compare two different strategy red blood cell transfusion patient acute brain injury : `` liberal '' strategy aim maintain hemoglobin ( Hb ) concentration great 9 g/dL `` restrictive '' approach aim maintain Hb concentration great 7 g/dL . The target population patient suffer traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) , subarachnoid hemorrhage ( SAH ) intracranial hemorrhage ( ICH ) . The primary outcome neurological outcome , evaluate use extend Glasgow Outcome Scale ( eGOS ) , 180 day initial injury . Secondary outcome include , amongst others , 28-day survival , intensive care unit ( ICU ) hospital lengths stay , occurrence extra-cerebral organ dysfunction/failure development infection thromboembolic event ( venous arterial ) . The estimated sample size 4610 patient demonstrate reduction primary outcome 50 % 45 % group ( 2305 patient arm ) . The study initiate September 2016 several European ICUs expect least 4 year . The result trial help improve blood product transfusion use specific patient population provide additional data sub-groups patient high-risk brain ischemia , intracranial hypertension cerebral vasospasm .</detailed_description>
