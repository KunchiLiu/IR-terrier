	<detailed_description>Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis ( AIS ) complex three-dimensional deformity spinal column , include scoliosis coronal plane , fix rotation vertebral body physiological curvature loss sagittal plane . AIS relatively high prevalence adolescent . Exercise common conservative therapy mild AIS patient widely use reduce spinal deformity halt curve progression . There two kind exercise : generalise physiotherapy exercise physiotherapeutic scoliosis specific exercise ( PSSE ) . Little evidence favor generalise physiotherapy exercise . There increase evidence suggest PSSE halt curve progression . Nevertheless , evidence concern PSSE inadequate low quality . Thus , aim study identify efficacy PSSE Cobb 's angle , rotation angle , fall index , pulmonary function , bone quality , health relate quality-of-life ( HRQoL ) mild AIS patient , promote PSSE 's application Shanghai . The AIS patient recruit investigated Xinhua Hospital , Xinhua Hospital Chongming Branch , Shanghai First Rehabilitation Hospital , Shanghai Yangzhi Rehabilitation Hospital , Shanghai Yangpu Daqiao Community Health Service Centre . Prior inclusion , subject examine physiatrists . The subject ' height , weight , shoulder , chest , back pelvic asymmetry , Adams forward bend test evaluate record . The following information obtain subject , include demographic data ( example , age sex ) , menarche status girl , family history . A parent subject ask sign inform consent form subject participate study . Eligible subject randomize 1:1 allocation ratio computer either intervention group , perform PSSEs guidance experience physiotherapist expertise scoliosis outpatient clinic ; control group , perform generalise physiotherapy exercise . All subject receive treatment allocate assessed initial visit 6 month . A multidimensional , comprehensive evaluation include aesthetic appearance , radiographic measurement , static balance test , pulmonary function test , bone quality , HRQoL use .</detailed_description>
