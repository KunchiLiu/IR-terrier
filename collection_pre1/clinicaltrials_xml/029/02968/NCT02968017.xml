	<detailed_description>Measuring resistance fetal middle cerebral artery ( MCA ) important factor assess fetal well-being . On , Pulsatility Index ( PI ) MCA may indicate decrease fetal oxygenation . Furthermore , PI measure Fetal MCA index parameter calculation Cerebro-Placental Ratio ( CPR ) use evaluate whether exist disturbance Placental-Umbilical Feto-cerebral circulation . The CPR measurement enable practitioner predict fetus reaction intrauterine hypoxemia . The CPR measurement commonly use evaluate small gestational age ( SGA ) fetuses distinguish constitutionally small fetus one suffer placental insufficiency . For suffer placental insufficiency , CPR measurement aid decide optimal time mode delivery . Recently , researcher ponder CPR measurement may aid predict disturbance fetal oxygenation delivery . A number study show appropriate gestational age fetuses abnormal CPR measurement may susceptible delivery complication manner fetus suffer placental insufficiency . The question yet answer whether MCA measurement reliable term pregnancy . This question arise due impression MCA measurement term highly variable , even take optimal condition . The aim study evaluate intra-observer variability MCA measurement optimal condition , Uncomplicated Term Pregnancies .</detailed_description>
