	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Umbilical Cord Mesenchyme Stem Cell Local Intramuscular Injection Treatment Uterine Scars</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In recent decade , percentage Cesarean section ( CS ) deliveries dramatically increase around world . While allows safe delivery many situation , risk severe maternal complication associate cesarean delivery higher associate vaginal delivery . These maternal complication include short term , long-term , next pregnancy , non-pregnant state , abnormal uterine bleed postmenstrual spotting . Uterine niche , also name cesarean scar defect , deficient cesarean scar , pouch , diverticulum , define triangular anechoic structure site scar gap myometrium site previous caesarean section . It one common complication associate previous cesarean section . The primary clinical manifestation postmenstrual spotting , may seriously affect daily life patient . The treatment include medical treatment , oral contraceptive , surgical method , hysteroscopy resectoscopic correction , endometrial ablation , laparoscopic surgery , transvaginal repair surgery . Although good outcome report study , present treatment could decrease incidence among woman undergo cesarean section . Mesenchymal stem cell ( MSCs ) long-lived cell ability self-renewal differentiation multi-potential cell , osteoblast , adipocytes smooth muscle cell . Trials MSCs patient myocardial infarction show excellent safety efficacy . In trial , investigator postulate MSCs reduce uterine niche convert scar tissue viable myometrium . To test hypothesis , investigator therefore undertake Phase II clinical trial treatment uterine niche among primiparous woman undergo cesarean section . This randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical trial design investigate efficacy safety umbilical cord mesenchyme stem cell treatment caesarean section uterine scar . A total one hundred twenty ( 120 ) participant randomize ( 1:1 ) receive direct local intramuscular injection 1*10^7 MSCs ( dose 1*10^7 cell 1 ml 0.9 % saline ) ( MSCs group ) identical-appearing 1ml 0.9 % saline placebo ( placebo-controlled group ) . Cesarean procedure care follow usual practice . All participant perform obstetricians investigator ' department use unified double-layer uterine closure technique continuous absorbable polyglycolic 1-0 suture . After suture uterine incision , direct local intramuscular injection perform uterine incision soon possible operate table . One ml solution inject twenty aliquot 0.05ml injection site incision . Injection sit select near incision evenly 20 different site . Participants follow 6 week , 3 month 6 month . For purpose endpoint analysis safety evaluation , investigator utilize `` intention-to-treat '' study population .</detailed_description>
