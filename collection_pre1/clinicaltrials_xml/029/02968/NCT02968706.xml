	<brief_title>HFNC Versus Conventional Nasal Cannula Oxygen Performance Patients Receiving Colonoscopy Under IV Sedation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intravenous sedation colonoscopy become standard practice United States give high patient satisfaction procedural quality . The common use short act sedative agent propofol . Although possess safe rapidly reverse pharmacokinetic property , propofol intravenous infusion lead respiratory depression hypoxemia . In one prospective study , hypoxemia event , define oxygen saturation less 90 percent find 20 percent patient receive colonoscopy use propofol sedation . The mechanism hypoxemia mainly hypoventilation , airway collapse , carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) retention . When come gastrointestinal procedure , use oxygen device augment ventilation usually avoid , ex : positive pressure ventilation , since lead bowel distention affect quality procedure . Therefore hospital United States still use nasal cannula oxygen therapy gastrointestinal procedure , lack available option oxygen therapy improve hypoventilation prevent hypoxemia . High flow nasal cannula ( HFNC ) new generation oxygen therapy . It provide constant high flow oxygen delivery heat humidify air . Moreover , study high velocity airflow create effect `` positive end expiratory pressure '' thus assist ventilation work breathing . Compared conventional nasal cannula face mask , HFNC demonstrate superior performance oxygenation , work breathe patient comfort many study . Since invention , HFNC study post-cardiac surgery , post-extubation , bronchoscopy dental procedure show equal good oxygen performance comparison nasal cannula . While capnographic monitoring study prevent hypoxemia sedation , study do evaluate clinical utility new generation oxygen therapy . Obesity associate increased frequency sedation relate complication especially hypoxemia propofol mediate sedation advance endoscopic procedure . The Investigators hypothesize HFNC may improve oxygen performance compare conventional nasal cannula obese patient receive colonoscopy intravenous sedation .</detailed_description>
