	<detailed_description>The study involve adult patient undergoing elective thoracolumbar-sacral spine surgery involve 1-5 spine level , Brigham Women 's hospital anticipate post surgical hospital stay one three day . These patient randomly assign BWH Investigational Drug Service one three different group , consist 33 patient : • Group 1 patient receive epidural hydromorphone 0 . 5mg bupivicaine 6.25 mg total volume 10 ml . - Group 2 patient receive hydromorphone 0.5 mg preservative free saline total volume 10ml . - Group 3 patient receive 10 ml preservative free saline serve control group . Exclusion criterion would : 1 . Anyone unable sign consent 2 . Pregnant patient 3 . Non-elective surgery 4 . Allergy study drug equipment 5 . Any medical condition compatible use epidural anesthesia multiple sclerosis 6 . Any patient rash surgical site cerebrospinal leak repair 7 . Any patient currently anticoagulated reason ( drug pathologic condition ) 8 . Patient opinion Investigator may suitable candidate study All subject provide information study surgical appointment . The study coordinator approach patient permission surgeon introduce study one co- investigator explain study patient . The investigator subsequently review eligibility inclusion criterion ( thoracolumbar-sacral spine surgery , hospital stay great one three day , history allergy local anesthetic opioids ) exclusion criterion ( document allergy , pregnant female , minor , ongoing cerebrospinal fluid leak coagulation status ) . If subject continue meet criterion , investigator explain study patient answer question . Thereafter , patient provide consent form review 24/7 contact number question regard study . All patient question answer informed consent obtain investigator time . The patient provide contact information . A co-investigator available answer question 24-hour basis . It explain patient permit withdraw study time reason day surgery . On arrival preoperative area , patient assign code one investigator . The BWH Investigational Drug service utilized ensure randomization proper preparation storage study drug safety subject . The subject randomize one three group . Subjects randomize BWH Investigational Drug Service . The surgeon inform patient 's participation study study group assign . Prior premedication , patient make familiar use 10-cm visual analog scale ( VAS ) , 0 = pain , 10 = worst pain imaginable . The baseline ( VAS ) score record . All routine standard practice surgery , anesthesia perioperative care follow . All patient premedicated ( 0.025 - 0.05mg/kg ) midazolam . An epidural place preoperative area anesthesiologist . ■ Patients randomize . Patients belong Group 1 receive epidural hydromorphone 0.5mg bupivicaine 6.25 mg total volume 10 ml ; Group 2 patient receive hydromorphone 0.5 mg preservative free saline total volume 10ml . Group 3 receive 10 ml preservative free saline control group . The epidural place anesthesiologist two vertebral level level surgery . A standard total intravenous anesthesia ( TIVA ) protocol follow since somatosensory motor evoke potential routinely monitor throughout surgery case . Anesthesia induce intravenous ( IV ) propofol ( 1.5-2.5mg/kg ) fentanyl ( 1.0-3.0 ug/kg ) . Tracheal intubation facilitate neuromuscular block drug . The anesthetic maintain TIVA technique consist propofol remifentanil infusion 0.125 ug/kg/hr maintenance , dilaudid 0.02-20.mg/kg begin titrate one hour incision , oxygen/air mixture 2:1 ratio . A BICS monitor use monitor depth anesthesia . At completion operation , anesthesiologist wake-up patient patient transfer post anesthesia care unit ( PACU ) . The postoperative pain , sedation , nausea/vomiting , constipation score obtain record Study Coordinator . This obtain visual analog scale ( VAS ) ( enclose ) every 15 minute 2 hour postoperative day one ( 24 hour ) . The type time first demand supplemental analgesia total amount also document . The primary endpoint study determine absolute reduction pain score among group . Secondary endpoint would include overall average pain control score , total amount postoperative opioid consumption ; degree opioid side effect opioid consumption , first demand supplemental analgesia ; time initial physical therapy participation , return activity daily live . The patient assessed question part REDCAP database first post-operative visit six week surgery . The question ask general satisfaction study relation pain , nausea , vomit sedation use 0-10 scale either post-op visit phone able return hospital .</detailed_description>
