	<brief_title>Alzheimer 's Disease Physiological , Cognitive Function BDNF Levels Plasma Adaptation After Exercise Training</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Present great amount region hippocampus cortex , Brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) essential learn memory process . This protein find low amount people AD . Acute physical activity moderate vigorous intensity would increase level plasma BDNF whether healthy person person AD . Nevertheless rest , healthy people high level BDNF individual AD . There study effect chronic exercise base BDNF level rest people AD . In hypothetical endurance training 18 session , whether interval continuous training level BDNF would increase people AD rest . Their physiological neuropsychological performance would also show rise .</detailed_description>
