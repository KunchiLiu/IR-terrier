	<brief_title>Cystoscopic Evaluation Predicting pT0 Urothelial Carcinoma Bladder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Archival specimen prior diagnostic TUR prepare 10-20 unstained 5-10 micron slide under-go next generation sequence compare final cystectomy specimen investigate potential pre-treatment signature predictive response chemotherapy understand genomic evolution primary tumor chemotherapy . All patient also urine , PBMC , serum/plasma collect baseline , day procedure , 4-6 week post-procedure , 6 month post-procedure . The baseline sample collect prior chemotherapy administration prior procedure . On day patient 's radical cystectomy , standard rigid cystourethroscopy perform . A urine sample collect bladder . A plasma sample collect patient anesthesia pre-op hold area . Visible tumor prior tumor site target tissue sample ( two site target ) . A standardized tumor quantification system employ document location presence tumor previous biopsy site . To end , investigator develop novel score system allow objective quantification endoscopic finding time cystoscopy index presence location papillary tumor , erythema , scar . Two additional random biopsy obtain , one posterior wall one lateral wall assessment genomic signature within normal-appearing mucosa . Tumor location relationship ureteral orifice note order assist surgeon performance radical cystectomy . The patient undergo radical cystectomy per standard care .</detailed_description>
