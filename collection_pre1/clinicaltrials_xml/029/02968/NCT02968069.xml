	<brief_title>A Predictive Model Based Narrow Band Imaging Early Gastric Cancerous Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Endoscopic forceps biopsy ( EFB ) consider gold standard commonly use histological diagnosis gastric epithelial neoplasia proper management.Many study show exist considerable discrepancy EFB subsequently resect specimens discrepancy rate 27.1-44.5 % . On hand , low diagnostic efficacy narrow band imaging ( NBI ) novice endoscopists endoscopists community hospital China , high diagnostic accuracy gastric cancerous lesion could observe . Here , investigator conduct study develop validate diagnostic model base narrow band image early gastric cancerous lesion endoscopic observation , try improve overall diagnostic efficacy gastric cancerous lesion .</detailed_description>
