	<brief_title>Avelumab With Hypofractionated Radiation Therapy Adults With Isocitrate Dehydrogenase ( IDH ) Mutant Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The active pharmaceutical ingredient Avelumab ( MSB0010718C ) fully human antibody immunoglobulin gamma-1 ( IgG1 ) isotype specifically target block Programmed death-ligand 1 ( PD-L1 ) Programmed cell death protein 1 ( PD-1 ) . Avelumab bind PD-L1 block interaction PD-L1 PD-1 . This remove suppressive effect PD-L1 anti-tumor cluster differentiation 8 ( CD8 ) + T cell , result restoration cytotoxic T cell response .</detailed_description>
