	<brief_title>LifeWalker Upright Walker v . Conventional Rollator Walker Predicate Device</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The LifeWalker Upright walker design address fall risk , slouch , user confidence comfort . The LifeWalker adjustable armrest handle enable user stand tall look ahead , provide support stability design differently conventional walker . The LifeWalker Upright 's design allow user walk within walker . This allow people walk inside walker oppose behind walker . The purpose project evaluate LifeWalker Upright walker improve walk report pain compare conventional rollator predicate walker device Aim 1 : Perform in-laboratory train Life Walker test compare functional gait outcomes Life Walker compare conventional rollator predicate assistive mobility device . We expect participant able walk longer perform efficiently measure gait function use Life Walker . Aim 2 : Perform in-laboratory test compare self-reported pain Life Walker compare conventional rollator predicate assistive mobility device . We expect participant report less pain efficient upright posture use Life Walker . Aim 3 : Perform in-laboratory test compare measure quality life Life Walker compare conventional rollator predicate mobility device . We expect participant report good outcome quality life measure experience good self-esteem due good mobility use Life Walker . Participants first complete series gait test . Gait test include six minute walk test 10 meter walk test . In addition hand forearm load grip test use load sensor . Participants also ask videotaped training session . After test complete , participant ask complete set self-report questionnaire . During device session , participant heart rate , blood pressure blood oxygenation measure . All procedure repeat device .</detailed_description>
