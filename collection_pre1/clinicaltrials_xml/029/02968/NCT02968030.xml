	<brief_summary>Aging characterize functional loss among , related mobility balance may highlight . Regular physical activity , include muscle strengthening exercise , beneficial healthy elderly . Thus , study aim verify influence 8 weeks-program low limb strengthen exercise balance functional mobility physically active elderly . The investigator evaluate 18 woman , age 61 80 year . Balance assessment perform use Functional Reach Test ( FRT ) , Timed Up Go ( TUG ) test Romberg test stable unstable soil . For muscular strengthen low limb , workload determine strength reach eight-repetition maximum test ( 8RM ) , apply progressive load increment train session conduct ( 50 % , 60 % , 70 % 8RM ) , muscle strength reevaluate fourth week training , subsequent adjustment load subsequent training . The training take place two weekly meeting , 40-minute session , eight week . Data analyze use paired-t test ANOVA repeat measure . Among 18 evaluate elderly woman , 7 complete 8 week training propose . Decrease TUG time ( p = 0,035 ) statistically significant increase muscle strength observe muscle group train ( quadriceps , hamstring , adductor abductor ) . FRT ( p = 0.170 ) significantly different training . Therefore , strength training propose efficient improve muscle strength lower limb irregular physically active elderly , impact positively functional gain gait . However , gain muscle strength enough generate significant result static balance probably due type exercise perform well due limited muscle group low limb .</brief_summary>
