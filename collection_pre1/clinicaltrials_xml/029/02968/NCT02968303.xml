	<brief_summary>Rationale : The combination ipilimumab nivolumab induces relatively high response rate promise response depth late stage melanoma . Nevertheless , take time till response occur still significant number patient benefit treatment , due rapid progressive disease resistance therapy . In contrast immunotherapy target therapy ( BRAF MEK inhibitor ) , induce fast high response rate , often short duration , even combine . Initial attempt combine vemurafenib dabrafenib + trametinib ipilimumab fail due toxicity . Patients elevated level serum LDH less likely respond immunotherapy compare patient normal LDH level . This mean patient benefit immunotherapy . This raise question , whether response rate upon immunotherapy improve upfront reduction tumor burden normalization LDH . The investigator postulate induction therapy combine BRAF+MEK inhibition , subsequent LDH normalization , improve response rate rate see LDH normal patient . To address question investigator setup randomize phase 2 trial metastatic melanoma patient elevate serum LDH comparing response rate upon ipilimumab + nivolumab versus ipilimumab + nivolumab precede 6 week vemurafenib + cobimetinib induction . Furthermore , less half patient treat combination ipilimumab nivolumab receive maintenance nivolumab , approximately 40 % patient discontinue treatment toxicity . In 70 % patient responses ongoing despite discontinuation treatment due toxicity . This raise question , extent maintenance therapy add clinical benefit ongoing immune response . Preclinical data indicate even continuous restimulation T cell result activation induce non-responsiveness ( anergy ) . Therefore , secondary objective trial , test response-driven nivolumab scheme Objectives : Primary Objective • To compare efficacy induction vemurafenib + cobimetinib follow ipilimumab + nivolumab ( Arm A ) versus upfront ipilimumab + nivolumab treatment ( Arm B ) . Secondary Objectives - To describe duration response overall survival induce vemurafenib + cobimetinib follow combination ipilimumab + nivolumab ( Arm A ) compare ipilimumab + nivolumab ( Arm B ) - To describe rate quality toxicity observe two study arm - To describe rate ongoing response upon response-driven flat dose ( 240mg , q2w ) nivolumab maintenance - To determine immune-activating capacity induction therapy vemurafenib + cobimetinib follow combination ipilimumab + nivolumab . - To evaluate change systemic immune competence Study design : This two-arm phase 2 study consist 200 BRAFV600E/K mutation-positive late-stage melanoma patient elevate baseline LDH level ( &gt; ULN , &lt; 3xULN ) randomize 1:1 ( stratify accord LDH ) receive either vemurafenib + cobimetinib directly follow ipilimumab + nivolumab ( Arm A ) standard first line ipilimumab + nivolumab ( Arm B ) . Subsequently , patient arm receive flat dose ( 240mg , q2w ) nivolumab maintenance response-driven manner . Study population : Stage IV , unresectable stage III , BRAFV600E/K mutation positive melanoma patient , naïve BRAF/MEK , PD-1/PD-L1 CTLA-4 target therapy , 18 year old . Intervention : Patients randomize 1:1 receive either 6 week vemurafenib 960 mg bid + cobimetinib 60 mg QD 21-day , 7-day ( 21/7 ) schedule , directly follow 4 course ipilimumab 3mg/kg q3wk + nivolumab 1mg/kg q3wk ( Arm A ) first line standard 4 course ipilimumab 3mg/kg q3wk + nivolumab 1mg/kg q3wk ( Arm B ) . Subsequently , patient arm receive nivolumab maintenance flat dose ( 240mg , q2w ) response-driven manner accord response week 18 . Main study parameters/endpoints : Primary Endpoints • Compare best overall response rate ( BORR ) accord RECIST 1.1 arm week 18 start treatment . Secondary Endpoints - Progression-free survival ( PFS ) accord RECIST 1.1 - Overall survival ( OS ) - Percentage grade 3/4 toxicity accord CTCv4.03 - Percentage ongoing response , percentage patient require re-induction , response percentage upon re-induction - Changes tumor-specific T cell response</brief_summary>
