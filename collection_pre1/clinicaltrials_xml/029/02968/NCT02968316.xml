	<brief_title>Bioelectric Impedance Analysis Pregnancy Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BIA new method measure total body water , fat , lean mass . It measure noninvasively , investigator plan use InBody analyzer ( www.InBody.com ) study . The analysis take second require participant stand small platform grasp small device hand . The machine use low electrical current analyze body composition produce read-out . The investigator plan analysis longitudinally across gestation multiple trimester analyze ability predict maternal morbid condition prior current clinically-based criterion novel marker aid routine prenatal care , compare traditional weight measurement currently do . Both increase maternal prepregnancy weight ( body mass index ) increase maternal gestational weight gain associate increased risk multiple obstetrical complication ( maternal fetal ) . The investigator seek compare current standard BIA ability predict maternal/fetal adverse outcome gestational diabetes , preeclampsia , cesarean delivery . PRIOR RESEARCH There study pregnant patient correlate BIA pregnancy outcome : 1 . Sween et al perform BIA 370 woman find body fat composition correlate development preeclampsia . 2 . Gomes de Silva et al perform BIA 65 woman preeclampsia 51 control find BIA result differ two group . 3 . Marshall et al perform BIA 41 pregnant woman third trim part multimodal analysis body composition 4 . Xu et al correlate BIA onset gestational diabetes PROTOCOL - Patients MFM practice approach time initial pregnancy visit ask participate . - If agree sign inform consent , follow occur : - The participant 's name place list participant - The participant InBody analysis perform one office nurse medical assistant . The result share participant treating physician . Rather , result file participant delivers . - Participants InBody analysis perform trim time schedule office visit well post-partum visit , routinely schedule approximately 6 week delivery . Those result also share participant physician . - After postpartum visit , data InBody analysis enter de-identified database , along participant 's baseline characteristic , pregnancy event , delivery outcomes , already participant 's office chart . No personal identifier require database . The data use correlate InBody result pregnancy outcomes . - The identifier actual list participant , require plan need InBody analysis prenatal visit .</detailed_description>
