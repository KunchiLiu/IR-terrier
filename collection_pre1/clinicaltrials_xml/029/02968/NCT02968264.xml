	<detailed_description>Background : Tetralogy Fallot ( TOF ) common cyanotic heart defect consist 7-10 % congenital heart disease estimate annual global incidence rate 38,000 . It fatal untreated ; 50 % patient alive 1 year age . Surgery dramatically improve survival &gt; 95 % repair TOF child alive one year . The initial justified enthusiasm benefit surgical therapy temper finding late sudden cardiac death secondary right ventricular ( RV ) dysfunction . The original trans-ventricular/trans-annular patch repair result significant pulmonary insufficiency lead RV dilation , subsequent functional tricuspid regurgitation , atrial arrhythmia , eventual RV failure ventricular arrhythmia . In attempt break cycle , increase number patient undergo late pulmonary valve implantation . Recognizing RV adapts stress signal lead idea leave mixed residual stenosis regurgitation may yield adaptive change limit RV dilation still allow adequate cardiac output . Early attempt limit pulmonary insufficiency RV damage involve minimal trans-annular patching complete annulus preservation ( AP ) . Emerging data suggest patient mixed lesion improve survival , 96.6 % alive 25-years comparison 85-90 % survival conventional technique . Preliminary Data : A review data compare AP TAP repair institution ( n=185 , AP repair=124 , TAP=61 ) demonstrate 10-15 year follow-up receive AP repair small RV volume pulmonary regurgitant jet width . They also see improve exercise capacity measure VO2 max test . The AP technique also see significantly decrease risk reoperation comparison TAP , 11 % 29 % respectively . Current Problem : Although trans-ventricular VSD closure along TAP known result increase risk long-term morbidity mortality , continue predominant repair strategy implement globally accord STS/EACTS database . Reasons : - Trans-ventricular/TAP approach technically easy annulus preservation , often require multiple pump run - There fear leave much obstruction - High quality evidence support one approach lacking . Gaps Literature 1 . Most data impact surgical strategy emerge single centre experience retrospective base small patient population . This make result difficult standardize general TOF population . 2 . Retrospective registry data publish STS EACTS omit many crucial surgical clinical variable potentially impact outcome . 3 . None current evidence base anatomically matched/adjusted patient</detailed_description>
