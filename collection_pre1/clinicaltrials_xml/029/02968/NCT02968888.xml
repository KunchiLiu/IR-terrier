	<brief_summary>The aim study investigate acute anabolic effect native whey , whey protein concentrate 80 ( WPC-80 ) milk bout strength training young elderly . The investigator hypothesize native whey give great stimulation muscle protein synthesis intracellular anabolic signal WPC-80 , WPC-80 give strong stimulus milk .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Anabolic Effects Whey Casein After Strength Training Young Elderly</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Increasing maintain muscle mass great importance population range athlete patient elderly . Resistance exercise protein ingestion two potent stimulators muscle protein synthesis . Both physical characteristic protein ( e.g . different digestion rate whey casein ) amino acid composition , affect potential certain protein stimulate muscle protein synthesis . Given superior ability rapidly increase blood leucine concentration high level , whey often consider potent protein source stimulate muscle protein synthesis . Native whey protein produce filtration unprocessed milk . Consequently , native whey different characteristic WPC-80 , expose heat acidification . Because direct filtration unprocessed milk , native whey intact protein compare WPC-80 . Of special interest high amount highly anabolic amino acid leucine native whey . The high level leucine great interest elderly individual study elderly show anabolic resistance effect protein feed strength training . By increase level leucine one might overcome anabolic resistance elderly . The aim double-blinded , randomize , partial cross-over study compare acute fractional protein synthesis intracellular signal response bout strength train intake 20 gram protein either native whey , whey protein concentrate 80 milk , young old individual . Furthermore , investigator wil investigate fractional protein breakdown , marker protein breakdown , amino acid concentration blood . The investigator hypothesize native whey induce great anabolic response whey protein concentrate 80 , whey protein concentrate 80 give strong anabolic response milk .</detailed_description>
