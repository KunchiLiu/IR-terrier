Accordingly , investigator develop randomize , placebo-controlled clinical trial ass clinical efficacy safety clofazimine . To eligible , participant must MAC lung disease , positive sputum culture MAC , currently take antibiotic MAC . Eligible participant ( 102 total enrol ) randomly give either clofazimine placebo 6 month , follow closely treat physician . The percentage participants become culture negative group compare , suspect participant treat clofazimine likely become culture negative . The safety clofazimine measure well potential benefit therapy include change lung function quality life .</detailed_description>
