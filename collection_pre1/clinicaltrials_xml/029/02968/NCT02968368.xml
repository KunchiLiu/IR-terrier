	<criteria>1 . Subjects must competent understand information give Independent Ethics Committee ( IEC ) Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) approve information sheet consent form must sign date inform consent prior study mandated procedure . 2 . Subjects must willing able comply study requirement . 3 . Age ≥ 18 year . 4 . Subjects must current diagnosis CKD estimate glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) &lt; 60 ml/min/1.73m2 ≥15 ml/min/1.73m2 , calculate use abbreviate version Modified Diet Renal Disease equation ( MDRD ) assess via Screening laboratory result . 5 . Subjects must iron deficiency anemia define follow criterion assess via Screening laboratory result : 1 . Hb &lt; 11.0 &gt; 8.0g/dl 2 . AND Ferritin &lt; 250 ng/ml 3 . AND Transferrin saturation ( TSAT ) &lt; 25 % 6 . Subjects use ESA agent must stable dose least 8 week prior randomization ( i.e great 20 % change weekly dose ) . 7 . Female subject childbearing potential ( include perimenopausal female menstrual period within 1 year prior screen ) must agree use reliable method contraception study completion least 4 week follow final study visit . Reliable contraception define method result low failure rate , i.e. , less 1 % per year use consistently correctly , implant , injectables , intrauterine contraceptive device ( IUDs ) , complete sexual abstinence , vasectomized partner . Oral contraceptive medication allow study . Female subject surgically sterile ( bilateral tubal ligation , bilateral oophorectomy hysterectomy ) postmenopausal ( defined menstrual period within 1 year screening ) also allow participate . 1 . Subject anemia due cause iron deficiency , include , limited : 1 . Untreated untreatable severe malabsorption syndrome . 2 . Myelosuppression use ( permit take stable dose least 3 month prior Randomization expect stay stable throughout study treatment period long clinical evidence suspicion myelosuppression contribute subject 's anemia ) . 2 . Subject receive follow prior Randomization : 1 . Intravenous ( IV ) iron injection within previous 4 week administration intramuscular depot iron preparation within previous 12 week . 2 . Oral iron supplementation , take specifically treat anemia within previous 2 week ( multivitamin contain iron permit ) . 3 . Blood transfusion donation within previous 12 week . 3 . Subject initiation dialysis renal transplant consider likely study . 4 . Subject receive renal transplant within 12 month prior Randomization . 5 . Subject know hypersensitivity allergy active substance excipients ferric maltol capsule . 6 . Subject contraindication treatment iron preparation , e.g . hemochromatosis , chronic hemolytic disease , sideroblastic anemia , thalassemia , lead intoxication induce anemia . 7 . Impaired liver function indicate alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate transaminase ( AST ) &gt; 3 time upper limit normal assessed via screen laboratory result . 8 . Subjects clinically significant vitamin B12 folic acid deficiency determine Screening laboratory result ( rescreen follow least 2 week start treatment vitamin B12 folate replacement permit ) . 9 . Subjects pregnant breast feeding . 10 . Concomitant medical condition significant active bleeding likely initiate prolong anemia ; example coagulation disorder recurrent GI bleeding . 11 . Subject schedule expect hospitalization and/or surgery course study ; exception surgery relate fistulae vascular access . 12 . Participation interventional clinical study within 30 day prior Screening . 13 . Subject cardiovascular , liver , renal , hematologic , psychiatric , neurologic , gastrointestinal , immunologic , endocrine , metabolic , central nervous system disease , opinion Investigator , may adversely affect safety subject and/or efficacy study drug severely limit lifespan subject .</criteria>
