	<brief_summary>There 10 million atrial fibrillation ( AF ) patient China , patient risk stroke , heart failure sudden death . Persistent AF still refractory disease , single catheter ablation success rate around 30-50 % . Hybrid strategy consist thoracoscopic epicardial ablation transvenous endocardial ablation seem attractive procedure improve treatment persistent AF . However , center report preliminary result , conclusion controversial . The investigator previously report minimally invasive surgical ablation leave thoracoscope achieve good result . Recently , investigator successfully explore hybrid procedure comb unique surgical technique transvenous catheter ablation . Here , investigator present study evaluate efficacy safety novel hybrid procedure . The hypothesis hybrid approach efficient surgical ablation alone treatment persistent AF . This study non-randomized control study within single institution . Isolated persistent AF patient admit cardiovascular surgery department Shanghai Xinhua Hospital screen enrollment study . The study recruit 180 patient total . Based willingness , patient divide hybrid group minimally invasive ( MIS ) group . The MIS group patient surgical ablation surgery leave thoracoscope investigator report , hybrid group patient additional transvenous catheter ablation surgical ablation do operation . The ratio hybrid MIS group expect 1:1 , group contain 90 patient . The perioperative data collect , patient follow 6 month . The primary outcome rate sinus rhythm 6 month post operation . The secondary outcome include antiarrhythmic drug rate , perioperative complication , major cardiovascular event , stroke , leave ventricular systolic function , medical expense , serum brain natriuretic peptide level quality life . The aim evaluate efficacy safety novel hybrid procedure , therefore provide evidence hybrid strategy treatment persistent AF .</brief_summary>
