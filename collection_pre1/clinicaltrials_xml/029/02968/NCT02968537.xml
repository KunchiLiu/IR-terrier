	<brief_title>Learning Resist Urge : Inhibition Training Abstinent Patients With Alcohol Use Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Therapeutic intervention treat alcohol use disorder ( AUD ) still need improve . A novel alcohol-specific inhibition-training seem promise new intervention . In study , recently abstinent patient AUD attend inpatient treatment program randomly assign one two alcohol-specific inhibition-training group ( vary Go/NoGo-ratio ) control condition . Besides effect drink behavior , inhibition implicit attitude , investigator expect train influence neurophysiological reactivity alcohol relate stimulus . A subgroup patient therefore additionally undergo EEG record neurophysiological effect train assess related clinical outcome . Furthermore , since training effect rely learn process , influence endogenous cortisol level ( consolidation-enhancer peak morning ) training outcome examine variation daytime training . All patient ' inhibitory control implicit association towards alcohol measure training . The training effect examine proximal outcome variable ( e.g . implicit association , inhibitory control , abstinence relate self-efficacy , crave ) distal outcome variable 3- , 6- 12- month follow-up ( e.g . percent abstinent day ( primary outcome ) ) .</detailed_description>
