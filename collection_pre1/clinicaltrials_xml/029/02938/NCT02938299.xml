	<detailed_description>Phase III , open-label , randomize , control multi-center study . In study , 214 patient enrol parallel assign ( via randomization system ) 1:1 fashion one two different arm : ARM 1 : Patients Arm 1 receive multiple intratumoral administration injectable cutaneous , subcutaneous , nodal tumor mixture L19IL2 L19TNF weekly 4 week ( injectable tumor disappear , intolerance study treatment opinion investigator immediate surgical resection treatment melanoma warrant , whichever occurs first ) . The whole volume L19IL2/L19TNF equally distribute among injectable lesion . Newly occur injectable melanoma lesion within 4 week treatment period also treat described . For new lesion treatment period extend beyond pre-defined 4 week- treatment period clock start time first intralesional L19IL2/L19TNF injection . Surgical resection exist metastasis follow within 4 week end treatment . Surgery perform safety evaluation carry week 5 , indicate , may carry day safety evaluation . ARM 2 : Patients Arm 2 receive directly surgical resection melanoma tumor lesion within 4 week randomization .</detailed_description>
