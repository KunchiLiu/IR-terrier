	<brief_summary>The investigator evaluate dietary modulation LIPC rs1800588 ( -514 C/T ) lipid glucose use randomize cross-over design compare high-fat Western diet low-fat traditional Hispanic diet Caribbean Hispanics ( n=42 ; 4 weeks/phase ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dietary Modulation Hepatic Lipase ( LIPC ) -514 C/T Variant Associations With Lipids Glucose</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The LIPC -514 C/T single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) inconsistently associate high density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C ) population study , support possibility modulation dietary factor . To investigate interaction common LIPC -514 ( C/T ) SNP dietary fat , investigator compare change lipid glucose response two level dietary total fat ( 20 % energy intake vs. 39 % energy intake ) crossover , randomize dietary intervention study enrol Caribbean Hispanics . Individuals screen LIPC rs1800588 genotype prior enrollment , genotype-associated difference response diet evaluate . The study design test follow hypothesis : 1 . Carriers T allele consume low fat ( LF ) diet decrease hepatic lipase activity compare subject CC genotype -514 ( C/T ) polymorphism . Conversely , individual consume high fat ( HF ) diet , T carrier exhibit impaired ability regulate hepatic lipase activity . 2 . Based difference hepatic lipase activity , investigator hypothesize significant clinically relevant proportion individual variability fast plasma HDL-C response change dietary fat intake would due variability LIPC locus . Specifically , CC subject respond increase total dietary fat consumption significant increase HDL-C concentration . Conversely , increase fat consumption T carry subject result decrease HDL-C concentration .</detailed_description>
