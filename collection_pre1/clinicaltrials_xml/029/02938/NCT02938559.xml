It propose add memory enhance strategy CT may improve MDD outcome : ( ) MDD often characterize memory impairment , ( b ) evidence memory impairment modifiable , ( c ) CT typically entail activation emotion , ( ) emotion impair bias memory ( e ) evidence memory content therapy session poor . Hence , overall goal evaluate integrating strategy design enhance memory content CT session improve treatment outcome MDD . Cognitive support involve series specific procedures support encode retrieval stage episodic memory .
