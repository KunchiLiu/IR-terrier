	<detailed_description>During perioperative period surgical patient experience profound change physiological process . In addition surgical stress , variation part due pharmacological treatment commonly use anesthesia analgesia surgical procedure . Opioids essential drug management acute perioperative pain . In last year much attention pay hyperalgesia induced opioids , represent clinically significant condition follow acute chronic exposure opioids . It suggest increase gene expression μ-opioid receptor development hyperalgesia could link epigenetic mechanism . Epigenetic alteration typically involve change chromatin structure , compose DNA , histones non-histone protein . Main change clinical set covalent modification N-terminal sequence histone proteins DNA methylation . In particular , DNA methylation carry addition methyl group fifth carbon atom cytosine residue ( 5mC ) , mainly localize CpG region . DNA methylation consider mechanism gene silence . It complex process regulate whole family enzyme call DNA methyl-transferase ( DNMTs : DNMT1 , DNMT2 , DNMT3a , DNMT3B , DNMT3L ) catalyze transfer methyl group . In particular DNMT 1 , 3a , 3b study development neuropathic pain model . Through immunohistochemical analysis observe dorsal root ganglion adult rat ( L4-5 ) DNMT3B show important up-regulation observe already 1 week induction model persist 4 week ; contrary , DNMT1 DNMT3a show moderate transient up-regulation . Other study show different pattern pain , acute inflammatory , expression level DNMT3a DNMT3B particularly high . All finding suggest important activity enzymes different model pain . Opioids admnistration seem related increase degree DNA methylation . In study publish 2013 , Doehring et al . rat degree DNA methylation patient heroin addict undergo methadone substitution treatment . Patients treat opioids show overall increase DNA methylation , particular μ-opioid receptor . It interesting note degree DNA methylation correlate intensity pain report subject analyze study . In literature currently present data relate degree DNA methylation surgical patient receive acute treatment opiates opioid-naive prior surgery . The primary objective study assess degree perioperative DNA methylation ( extracted whole blood ) patient undergo major surgery expose opiate accord current clinical practice compare preoperative baseline level . The timing ( preoperative v intraoperative v postoperative ) possible increase degree DNA methylation happen assess . The secondary objective : observe possible correlation degree DNA methylation intensity acute postoperative pain , observe possible correlation degree DNA methylation incidence postoperative nausea vomiting , observe possible correlation degree DNA methylation gene expression μ opioid receptor , observe possible correlation degree DNA methylation expression gene mainly involved methylation process , compare degree DNA methylation preoperative phase different patient involve study . MEDAPO trial monocentric clinical trial use human tissue vitro . Because lack knowledge literature increase degree DNA methylation follow acute administration opioids surgical patient , study explorative . Moreover , able avoid exposure opiates intraoperative phase , possible guarantee postoperative analgesia without opioid treatment , interest see increase methylation occur already intraoperative phase whether related time exposure treatment opiates . This provide useful information well plan time randomization future trial compare various postoperative analgesic technique . 20 consecutive patient undergo major surgery perform general anesthesia express consent participate study enrol . This sample adequate allow observation possible increase DNA methylation opioid-naive patient expose anesthesia/analgesia base opiate accord current clinical practice . Descriptive analysis relate primary objective trial perform . We perform parametric test pair data observe correlation degree DNA methylation acute postoperative pain . After verify signature inform consent , presence inclusion criterion absence exclusion criterion , patient consider eligible . Each patient assign serial number identify sample use molecular analysis make anonymous . The study period extend signing inform consent 48 hour end surgical procedure . The participation study change treatment plan patient : surgical procedure anesthetic conduct represent normal daily clinical practice without variation regardless enrollment patient . At time arrival operate room patient monitor accord standard clinical practice relation type surgery ( ECG , SpO2 , EtCO2 Invasive Blood Pressure ) . After monitor patient , place peripheral venous catheter ≤ 20 G arterial catheter ( 20G ) radial humeral artery . After adequate oxygenation anesthesia induce fentanyl ( 3 mcg/kg ) , propofol ( 2-2.5 mg/kg ) Rocuronium ( 0.6 mg/kg ) Succinylcholine ( 1 mg/Kg ) . The maintenance anesthetic level obtain use Sevoflurane 0.7 - 1.3 MAC ( minimum alveolar concentration ) , bolus dos Fentanyl ( 1mcg /kg ) possibly Rocuronium ( 0.15mg/kg ) every 45 minute end surgery . The acute postoperative pain first 48 hour treat continuous intravenous infusion morphine ( 1 mg/h ) , possibility patient self-administer bolus 1 mg morphine repeatable every 8 minute . Continuous infusion morphine precede intraoperative bolus ( immediately last stitch ) 0.1 mg/kg morphine . Ten minute awaken patient , pain poorly control ( NRS ≥ 4 ) , administer 1 mg morphine , repeatable every 5 minute , NRS &lt; 3 . Prophylaxis postoperative nausea vomit carry intravenous administration 0.1 mg/kg dexamethasone prior administration first dose fentanyl . In case postoperative nausea vomiting , administer droperidol 0.625 mg repeatable every 6 hour . During study period , addition anthropometric parameter , collect follow data : Duration anesthesia , define time induction general anesthesia awakening ; Duration surgery , define time surgical incision last stitch ; Fentanyl consumption , express mcg/kg /hour ; Morphine consumption first 24 48 hour end surgery ; Pain ( NRS ) rest deep inhalation 10 minute wake , 24 48 hour end surgery ; Number episodes nausea vomit first 24 48 hour end surgery ; Consumption antiemetic drug first 24 48 hour end surgery . During study period , addiction blood test carry accord routine clinical practice blood sample 5 ml collect perform epigenetic analysis . The semple add heparin EDTA ascorbate ACD anticoagulant agent store temperature - 20 ° C delivery Department Pharmacy Biotechnology take place last blood sample . Samples collect accord follow schedule reflect everyday clinical practice : - T0 : placement arterial catheter , prior administration opiate ( baseline blood gas ) ; - T1 : 1 hour general anesthesia induction ( hemogasanalysis verification mechanical ventilation ) ; - T2 : last stitch , intraoperative bolus morphine ( hemogasanalysis test blood loss ) ; - T3 : 24 ± 6 hour end surgery ( control blood count ) ; - T4 : 48 ± 6 hour end surgery ( control blood count ) . On blood sample , assess degree DNA methylation . The sample subject extraction RNA genomic DNA ZR-Duet ™ kit DNA / RNA Miniprep ( Zymo Research ) . The nucleic acid obtain sample store - 80 ° C analysis . Since change methylation genomic DNA observe various disease , need measure degree overall DNA methylation become important . The 5-mC DNA ELISA kit ( Zymo Research ) offer method high-throughput , easy identify quantify degree DNA methylation . Total RNA extract sample use gene expression study use RT-qPCR method . This technique allow make quantitative assessment gene ' expression codify μ opioid receptor enzyme belong family DNMTs . Based result , able correlate degree DNA methylation level expression investigate gene .</detailed_description>
