	<detailed_description>The aim examine energy consumption bariatric surgery . The study contribute knowledge operation complement intervention increase energy expenditure , mainly reduce sedentary . input design intervention reduce sedentary . Such intervention base knowledge mediator physical activity among subject need strengthen . Hypothesis Patients undergo bariatric surgery surgery low energy consumption related physical activity . The investigator hypothesis low energy consumption part retain independent whether one start exercise . About level physical activity energy expenditure Increased physical activity obesitasoperation correlate great weight loss . According Swedish Obesitas Surgery study , percentage person classify physically inactive decrease 45 % surgery le 10 % 6 month surgery . The proportion inactive people 6 year surgery 20 % . Patients undergo surgery obesity low energy consumption related physical activity surgery , measure pedometer self-reported physical activity . The result term increase physical activity surgery contradictory , physical activity increase study base self-reported physical activity study measurement make objective method . In Swedish study ( n = 56 woman ) change could see physical activity sedentary bariatric surgery . For group extremely obese ( BMI around 50 ) find reduce energy consumption 25 % surgery . The decrease relate low body weight ( average 53 kg ) thus decrease basal energy consumption lower energy consumption physical activity . A 20 % decrease body weight mean average 400 kcal / day low energy consumption . Among adult basal energy consumption approximately 1,500 kcal per day ( depend body size ) . For adult , average energy consumption related physical activity 300 kcal / day , compare 1000 kcal / day people traditionally live ( hunter / gatherer ) . Patients undergo bariatric surgery weak mediating factor physical activity . About sedentary Sedentary low energy consumption risk factor cardiovascular disease , type 2 diabetes premature death , even correction exercise / training body mass index ( BMI ) . Sedentary also contribute factor obesity , independent physical activity general . Moving everyday life ( apart exercise ) essential part investigator energy consumption . The difference energy consumption mainly sedentary person person relatively move life , may 700 kcal per day ) compare physically active ( move much work leisure ) , difference 2000 kcal per day . Among people overweight obesity , move everyday life responsible 90 % energy consumption related physical activity . Overweight people sedentary 2-2.5 hour per day normal weight people , correspond difference energy 350 kcal / day . In one year , equivalent 15 kg body weight . For population whole , 60 % waking hour sedentary . About behavioral change intervention reduce sedentary For patient undergo bariatric surgery increase physical activity everyday life / decrease sedentary important positive weight development favorable result regard health quality life , low energy consumption everyday life may remain surgery . It difficult change establish behavior , habit , well document social cognitive theory . Within theoretical framework also behavioral change model develop . According Nilsen et al habit behavior repeat become less automatically independently active awareness happen . Gradually change behavior control guide belief , attitude intention , trigger particular situation context . It show behavior repeat constant , unchanged context difficult change . So , change context habit establish important successful change habitual behavior . Generally , lack efficacy study intervention reduce sedentary . A meta-analysis intervention reduce sedentary among adolescent show small significant effect . The focus intervention research decrease sedentary connect television computer use , sit workplace sit car . About mediate factor increase physical activity decrease sedentary Mediating factor increase physical activity factor pave way change come continue . The best evidence available self-efficacy ( situation-bound self-confidence , example , `` I know I take uo training break . `` ) , social support ( support encouragement family friend ) enjoyment ( experience / joy movement ) .</detailed_description>
