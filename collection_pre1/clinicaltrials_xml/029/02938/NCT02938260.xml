	<brief_summary>Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) common arrhythmia , account one third hospital admission 1 % emergency department visit ( ED ) . Approximately 65 % present ED AF admit . There also numerous reason patient get AF rapid ventricular rate ( AF RVR ) hospitalization . In acute setting patient often treat diltiazem , non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker ( ND CCB ) , metoprolol , beta blocker ( BB ) . Non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker ( diltiazem verapamil ) use consider harmful national guideline recommend use patient decompensated heart failure ( HF ) . This recommendation base study long-term treatment . The purpose study assess difference metoprolol diltiazem acute treatment AF RVR patient HF reduce ejection fraction ( HFrEF ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>AF HF frequently see hospital set . AF affect 2 million people United States , HF affect 5 million . These disease state significant morbidity mortality impact AF lead 4 fold increase stroke 2 fold increase death , 50 % patient new HF diagnosis die within 5 year . These two disease state share several common risk factor include , age , hypertension , diabetes mellitus , heart disease . Based relationship change myocardial structure , function , conduction two also risk factor one another . Of patient HF , 61.5 % men 73 % woman develop AF . Of AF , 73 % men 75.6 % woman develop HF . Both AF guideline American Heart Association , American College Cardiology , Heart Rhythm Society HF guideline American College Cardiology Foundation American Heart Association recommend use ND CCB patient HFrEF . The HF guideline specify avoid ND CCB patient reduce LVEF , also mention avoid calcium channel blocker general possible exception amlodipine , due know adverse effect potential harm . However , short term use diltiazem acute control RVR patient HFrEF clearly evaluate . Three study compare use BB ND CCB acute treatment AF RVR . These study exclude severe ( New York Heart Association Class IV ) decompensated HF , however , comment patient compensate HFrEF . Most study illustrate difference , recent study report success rate ( heart rate ( HR ) &lt; 100 bpm within 30 minute ) 95.8 % intravenous ( IV ) diltiazem 46.4 % IV metoprolol ( p &lt; 0.0001 ) . When compare use long term short term therapy patient HFrEF different perspective emerges . Both BB ND CCB negative inotropic effect harmful acute HF exacerbation worsen symptom . However , BB routinely recommend chronic use HFrEF due add neurohormonal benefit , time delay HF progression reduces mortality . In contrast , long term treatment ND CCB pulmonary congestion associate increase cumulative rate cardiac event ( hazard ratio 1.41 ) . The comparative short term benefit patient still unclear . In small study , patient AF RVR severe HF , 97 % treat IV diltiazem HR reduction &gt; 20 % evidence HF exacerbation . A second study patient decompensated HF compare use IV metoprolol diltiazem control AF RVR . Both agent equally effective control heart rate difference safety endpoint evidence worsen heart failure . Neither study specifically address compensate HFrEF . Current literature focus risk associate ND CCB patient HFrEF , effect long-term treatment . Studies acute set often exclude severe decompensated HFrEF . Therefore , study focus metoprolol versus diltiazem acute control AF RVR patient HFrEF could offer insight current clinical practice .</detailed_description>

Patients receive two IV push dose switch treatment medication two dos . Patients SBP &lt; 90 mmHg decompensated heart failure ( ie present primarily worsen heart failure sign symptom , include dyspnea low extremity edema ) .
