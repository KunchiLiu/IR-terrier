This protocol consist progressive isometric , isotonic , plyometric , sport-specific exercise . Isometric exercise show reduce pain decrease motor cortex inhibition quadriceps . This approach would enable jump athlete resume sport within limit pain , improved muscle function , sufficient tendon structure re-organization . The diagnostic imaging work-up patellar tendinopathy typically consist ultrasound , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , combination . Ultrashort echo time ( UTE ) MRI advance MRI technique , enable assessment tissue short T2-time , tendon , structure invisible regular MRI .

	<detailed_description>Patellar tendinopathy ( 'jumper 's knee ' ) clinical condition gradually progressive activity-related pain insertion patellar tendon apex patella . Prolonged repetitive stress knee-extensor apparatus lead common overuse tendinopathy athlete different sport , result pain impaired performance athlete . High prevalence rate report jumping sport volleyball basketball ( 45 % 32 % elite athlete , respectively ) . Symptoms long-standing treat appropriately initial stage . Furthermore , currently strong evidence second-line treatment shockwave therapy platelet-rich plasma . Therefore , important improve exercise protocols first treatment choice . Tendinopathy widely accept , generic term encompass abnormal condition tendon . Clinical symptom include activity-related pain associate tenderness , localize swell impaired performance . Histopathologically , tendinopathy characterize structural disorganization tendon collagen alters load capacity specific tendon . Exercise therapy consider best initial treatment option tendinopathies histopathological change clinical improvement pain function demonstrate . Most study conduct use eccentric exercise protocol early study show positive effect , result promote isolate painful exercise standard care . One hypothesis behind potential beneficial effect eccentric exercise increase load result increase collagen synthesis subsequent healing response . However , recent systematic review demonstrate available literature support observable structural change explanation response eccentric exercise . Furthermore , eccentric exercise may effective reduce pain improve strength use in-season might even increase symptom jump athlete patellar tendon pathology . Progressive tendon-loading exercise therapy patellar tendinopathy constitute novel concept sport medicine . A recent publication advocate progressive 4-stage criteria-based exercise protocol within limit pain , consist progressive isometric , isotonic , plyometric , sport-specific exercise , result less reactive tendon , immediate decrease pain level , diminish motor cortex inhibition quadriceps muscle , potential restore collagen alignment . These new insight completely conflict painful heavy-load eccentric exercise protocol currently apply usual care . It currently unknown exercise therapy best strategy athletes patellar tendinopathy , adequately power randomized study lack . Although clinical examination represent gold standard diagnosis patellar tendinopathy , commonplace perform diagnostic image patellar tendon confirm diagnosis rule alternative diagnosis . Furthermore , image use estimate response treatment . This diagnostic image work-up usually consist magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , ultrasound , occasionally , combination . On `` regular '' MRI , increase tendon size visually increase signal intensity within proximal patellar tendon observe patellar tendinopathy , alter tendon microstructure invisible . A novel innovative method detect tendon abnormality ultrashort echo time ( UTE ) MRI technique . UTE enable accurate detection change reactive tendon visually quantitative manner measure T2* relaxation time UTE MRI also show quantitatively depict change tendon microstructure , therefore , innovative imaging modality allow in-vivo evaluation tendon regeneration . It currently unknown whether quantitative UTE MRI parameter change exercise treatment , related clinical symptom patellar tendinopathy , prognostic value exercise treatment response .</detailed_description>
