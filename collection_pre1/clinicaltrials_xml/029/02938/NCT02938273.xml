Adequate renal function , i.e . estimate creatinine clearance ≥30 mL/min calculate use CockcroftGault ( CG ) equation ( local institutional standard method ) . Adequate liver function , include : 1 . Total serum bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN ; 2 . Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) ≤ 2.5 x ULN AST ALT level ≤ 5 x ULN ( subject document metastatic disease liver ) . Have negative serum pregnancy test screening ( female childbearing potential ) . Both male female subject agree use highly effective contraception risk conception exists . ( Note : The effect trial drug develop human fetus unknown ; thus , woman childbearing potential men able father child must agree use 2 highly effective contraception , define method failure rate le 1 % per year . ) Highly effective contraception require throughout study least 120 day Avelumab treatment . Prior treatment : Systemic therapy , radiotherapy surgery direct locally advanced SCCHN .
