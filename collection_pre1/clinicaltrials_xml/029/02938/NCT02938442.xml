	<brief_summary>The purpose research compare effect breast cancer use new experimental breast cancer vaccine ( used stimulate immune cell production ) chemotherapy surgery versus usual treatment chemotherapy surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccination Triple Negative Breast Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study evaluate investigational agent , P10s-PADRE , peptide mimotope-based vaccine , combination standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy patient clinical stage I , II III estrogen-receptor ( ER ) negative , progesterone receptor ( PR ) negative HER2-negative ( = triple negative - TN ) breast cancer . P10s-PADRE administer MONTANIDE™ ISA 51 VG adjuvant . Human breast cancer express Tumor Associated Carbohydrate Antigens ( TACAs ) immunogenic , enhance anti-TACA antibody immune effector function already present may augment cytotoxic effect standard therapy . A randomized two-arm , open-label , multi-center phase II trial design goal evaluate efficacy combine vaccination P10s-PADRE formulation neoadjuvant chemotherapy . Patients randomly assign 2:1 ratio standard chemotherapy plus P10s-PADRE standard chemotherapy alone . Efficacy base rate pathologic Complete Response ( pCR ) observe among TN breast-cancer patient treat combination compare group patient receive standard chemotherapy alone .</detailed_description>
