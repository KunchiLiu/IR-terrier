	<brief_summary>General anesthesia ( GA ) process induction unconsciousness order undergo surgery . Unlike sleep , process `` anesthesia '' relate , 'Sleep ' include dream - do use drug cause kind `` unconsciousness '' control . The induction GA include combination drug - sleep ( inhalation anesthesia hypnotic drug intravenously ) , analgesia ( opiate ) muscle relaxant . Since patient paralyze surgery , anesthesiologists way know whether paralyzed patient asleep awake . If patient awake paralyze , situation name `` awareness anesthesia '' cause traumatic experience would leave cripple whole life . There many story patient lay paralyzed , awake , operate , remember every word happen operation course could mark anesthetist awake . The anesthesiologist might suspect patient awake paralyzed `` signal '' sympathetic nervous system - example increase heart rate blood pressure . But many patient receive different medication ( eg , beta-receptor blocker allow rise pulse ) obscure clinical sign , patient awake paralyze without noticed anesthesiologist . Some patient high risk suffer awareness anesthesia , anesthesiologist provide `` enough '' anesthesia , due medical condition , example : woman caesarean section GA , patient cardiac surgery injured trauma patient . Twenty year ago , EEG base tool , name `` BIS '' develop . Nowadays , BIS monitor 's credibility questionable 1 . The effect different hypnotic drug uniform . 2 . Recently show paralyzed patient BIS index could fall mimic situation sleep - enable paralyzed patient awake . Thus , clear whether calculation BIS monitor base physiological model define consciousness , loss consciousness consciousness arises . It seem BIS suitable certain drug - general monitor level anesthesia . The purpose present study develop universal system determine awareness GA use innovative algorithm analyze EEG wave , base physiological process attention perception underlying basis sedation GA .</brief_summary>
