	<brief_summary>A single arm , phase I , dose escalation trial expansion cohort , examine safety feasibility neoadjuvant pembrolizumab treatment early resectable NSCLC patient . Hypothesis : The investigator hypothesize response rate neo-adjuvant pembrolizumab high response rate advance NSCLC patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>16-28 patient apparently operable NSCLC , clinically stag I-II resectable tumor would recruit . Recruitment would base clinical assessment qualify Thoracic surgeon , appreciation recruit patient would eventually deem non-operable , non-resectable disease , harbor diagnosis different NSCLC . Screen consent patient would include diagnostic biopsy include core needle biopsy procedure . Fresh well formalin fix paraffin embed baseline tumor sample obtain accord common Standard Operating Procedures . Specimens would process per pathology standard care two core utilized later research study . A patient recruit previous diagnostic biopsy , would eligible trial willing undergo repeat diagnostic procedure . Processing biopsy material similar regardless first second biopsy . Trial treatment commence follow pathological confirmation NSCLC , complete stag include CT-PET brain imaging , positive pre-op cardiac pulmonary assessment . Study schedule Dose level study define dose drug well number treatment require interval last treatment surgery . At least 3 subject dose cohort must complete dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) evaluation period dose initiate next high dose level . Only toxicities occur DLT period consider DLTs utilized inform dose escalation decision . The DLT period start first dose pembrolizumab till 30 day post-surgery . Cohorts consist 3-6 subject per dose level , treat study therapy follow 3+3 schema . Dose escalation proceed cohort accord modify `` 3+3 design , '' explain follow scheme . Dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) define confined time define . As safety feature , new dosing/schedule level open end 30 post-operative day last patient previous cohort . If cohort one find high RP2D/schedule , next patient treat dose/schedule level minus one . Only one step dose reduction plan .</detailed_description>
