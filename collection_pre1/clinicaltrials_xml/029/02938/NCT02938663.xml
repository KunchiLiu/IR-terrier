	<brief_title>Health &amp; Culture Project : Cultural Factors Underlying Obesity African-American Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity significant problem African-American adolescent United States ( US ) . The recent data suggest double overweight ( BMI percentile &gt; 85th age gender ) obesity ( BMI percentile &gt; 95th age gender ) among racial/ethnic minority youth last 10 year . In 2007-8 , 39.5 % African-Americans age 12-19 overweight 24.4 % obese . These obesity rate approximately double non-Latino white . Until , effort reduce pediatric obesity target at-risk youth physically inactive over-consume energy dense food . More recently , however , focus broaden result new understanding cultural factor also shape physical activity behavior dietary pattern . With rapid increase cultural diversity US , Black culture quickly become part mainstream American culture , evolve within US , simultaneously integrate aspect different African Black American culture . Consequently , African- American youth come age US , multicultural society , interact people different cultural background lead interchange cultural attitude , beliefs behavior . Specifically , youth may adopt one four general cultural identity : ( ) bicultural identity-combining aspect family 's culture aspects mainstream American culture ; ( b ) US cultural identity- replace family 's culture mainstream American culture ; ( c ) traditional cultural identity- retain family 's culture reject mainstream American culture ; ( ) marginalize cultural identity- become alienated culture . Biculturalism consider adaptive process allow individual function effectively multicultural society still maintain supportive connection family 's culture . Hence , hypothesize racial/ethnic minority youth self-report bicultural identity maintain health promotion belief behavior reduce obesity risk compare minority youth identify one culture neither culture . Empirical investigation assess impact cultural identity health promotion behavior African-American adult report positive identification African-American culture self- perception successful `` black '' `` white '' way life associate health promotion behavior include reduced fat consumption participation leisure-time physical activity . Less known impact cultural identity physical activity behavior dietary pattern African-American youth . One important mechanism underlie link cultural identity , physical activity diet likely involve identity-based motivation process individual see health behavior congruent incongruent cultural identity . According identity-based motivation model , health promotion behavior ( e.g. , exercise , restrain eating , reduce fat sugar intake ) simply personal choice make moment rather identity-infused habit . Hence , ethnic minority view health promotion behavior White middle-class unhealthy behavior ( e.g. , high-fat , high-sugar diet , sedentary behavior ) define characteristic cultural identity less likely engage health promotion behavior . Oyserman et al argues even though physical activity diet important consequence health , identity-infused behavior engage less health consequence identity consequence . Hence , identity-based motivation may serve novel mechanism explain link cultural identity , physical activity diet , ultimately influence obesity risk African-American youth . It hypothesize racial/ethnic minority youth self report bicultural identity likely hold belief health promotion behavior congruent cultural identity compare youth identify one culture neither culture . 1 . Test whether bicultural identity among African-American adolescent associate obesity risk relate health behavior . H1 : African-American adolescent self-report bicultural identity report low BMIs , increase physical activity lower fat sugar intake compare adolescent maintain alternate cultural identity . 2 . Test whether bicultural identity associate identity-based motivation African-American adolescent . H2 : African-American adolescent self-report bicultural identity view health promotion behavior identity-congruent compare adolescent maintain alternate cultural identity . 3 . To evaluate whether identity-based motivation mediates association bicultural identity , obesity risk relate health behavior African-American adolescent . H3 : Identity-congruent health promotion belief mediate association biculturalism , BMI , physical activity diet African-American adolescent . The Health &amp; Culture project represent convergence two rapidly expand area pediatric obesity research ; role cultural identity identity-based motivation shape health promotion behavior . The investigator recently submit several paper publication examine association cultural identity , physical activity , diet diabetes-related metabolic risk factor obese African- American adolescent . Results demonstrate obese African-American adolescent , biculturalism negatively associate diabetes risk ( via increase pancreatic beta-cell function assess frequently-sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test ) . These relationship remain significant control household socioeconomic status , sex , pubertal maturation , fat/fat-free mass , physical activity diet . These exciting finding peek interest area cultural psychology , particularly relate racial/ethnic disparity pediatric obesity . Moreover , preliminary data extend finding others point important role cultural identity shape health health behavior . The researcher advance area research examine influence identity-based motivation context cultural identity . Because identity-based motivation modifiable psychosocial mechanism , rich depth understand identity-based motivation may help inform culturally-tailored intervention could large public health impact improve health promotion behavior racial/ethnic minority youth reduce economic burden pediatric obesity .</detailed_description>
