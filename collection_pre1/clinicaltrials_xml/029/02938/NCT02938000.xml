	<brief_title>E-Rehabilitation : Aerobic Resistance Training Stroke Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Seven million Americans stroke survivor another four million Americans expect stroke 2030.1 Nearly 800,000 stroke occur annually , 25 % occur previous stroke transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) .2 Put another way , stroke recurrence affect 30 % stroke survivors.3 Given high burden stroke among stroke survivor , prevent recurrence top priority post-stroke post-TIA management . Stroke survivor must cope impairment function range facial droop hemiparesis aphasia . These physical challenge mean even four year stroke , 71 % survivor feel completely recover stroke.4 The peak oxygen cost ( VO2 ) participate activity daily live walk high stroke survivor six month stroke able-bodied individuals.5,6 This increase energy cost relate decreased cardiorespiratory reserve , change tissue composition , gait deviation asymmetry.5,6 The exhaustion point hemiparetic stroke survivor fall within range aerobic fitness require perform activity daily live ( 3-5 METS [ Metabolic Equivalents ] ) .6 Small increase aerobic capacity would therefore translate ability perform activity daily living.6 The American Heart Association ( AHA ) American Stroke Association issue guideline 2014 recommend physical activity exercise improve stroke survivor ' functional ability , quality life , morbidity stroke recurrence.3 It goal study improve physical activity adherence stroke survivor thereby improve cardiorespiratory reserve reduce depression . Secondary variable examine include functional ability , balance , blood pressure , body mass index ( BMI ) , rate cerebrovascular cardiovascular event , mortality . Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation post-stroke post-TIA Cardiac rehabilitation care post-discharge stroke survivor establish standard practice . Several group evaluate efficacy comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation , provide patient acute MI , post-stroke population . This intervention show cost effective post-MI care , reduce healthcare cost overall ( attribute few re-admissions ) per quality-adjusted life year.12 Several group conduct small-scale trial cardiac rehabilitation among TIA stroke patient promise improvement cardiovascular fitness outcomes.13-16 Aerobic exercise rehabilitation stroke evaluate small randomized control trials.6,17 One group conduct randomize control trial comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation program chronic stroke patient ischemic events.14 Their intervention twice weekly , supervise exercise cycle ergometer ( upper low body ) 50-60 % maximal heart rate.14 At end ten-week program , subject intervention arm show significant improvement cardiovascular fitness measure peak oxygen consumption ( VO2 ) rating perceive exertion ( RPE ) three minute exercise.14 Self-reported depression anxiety score also improve intervention arm , though health-related quality life not.14 The group conduct large clinical trial call Cardiac Rehabilitation Adapted For Transient Ischemic Attack Stroke ( CRAFTS ) expand result earlier pilot.13,14 Another group London , Ontario conduct feasibility study evaluate use comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation ( CCR ) patient within 12 month TIA mild , non-disabling stroke.15 In prospective cohort study , 100 patient enrol 80 patient complete CCR group-based home-based progressive aerobic training six months.15 Diet counsel individual group-based session emphasize Mediterranean diet.15 Patients screen depression refer psychologist anxiety , depression , smoke cessation needed.15 Medications optimize meet AHA recommendation regard use aspirin anti-platelet agent , angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor , statin , blood pressure management diuretic.15 The result feasibility study promise improvement cardiopulmonary fitness , blood lipid profile , BMI , weight , waist circumference , smoke status , Duke Treadmill Score.15 Although study power evaluate morbidity stroke/TIA mortality , recurrence stroke 0 % among patient complete intake/outtake 4.6 % include patient leave CCR.15 A third study , PREVENT , randomize control trial Nova Scotia , Canada currently enrol patient post-TIA non-disabling stroke evaluate program rehabilitative exercise education improve risk factors.16 The trial aim randomize 250 patient control ( usual care ) 12-week comprehensive rehabilitation program comprise group- home-based exercise aerobic resistance training weekly education classes.16 Primary outcomes measure include lipid profile , blood pressure , waist circumference , fast glucose , hemoglobin A1c ; secondary outcome assess exercise capacity , walk endurance , cognitive function , depression , health-related quality life , physical activity.16 The trial power evaluate effectiveness intervention prevent morbidity stroke/TIA/cardiac events.16 AHA Recommendation In 2014 , American Heart Association ( AHA ) /American Stroke Association release recommendation regard physical activity stroke survivors.3 Prior starting , pre-exercise physical evaluation include electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , heart rate monitoring , grade exercise testing . Recommended exercise aerobic cardiovascular exercise 3-5 time weekly 20-60 minute ; aerobic activity achieve 40-70 % peak O2 heart rate maximum.3 Additional exercise resistance training two three day weekly also recommend . The propose intervention differs study involve one-way communication via stream video addition case management follow-up phone call . To knowledge , efficacy tele-intervention report previously . Thera-band® elastic band Thera band® elastic band ( The Hygienic Corporation , Akron , Ohio ) versatile exercise training tool use primarily provide grade resistance strength training.22 They use home-based resistance training stroke rehabilitation improvement strength , gait speed , functional ability.22 Combined aerobic activity , strength training hip flexor , extensor , abductor improve gait speed 3.6-12.6 meters/minute ambulatory stroke survivor ten week intervention.22-24 A small study ( sponsored manufacturer Thera band® ) find use Thera band® elastic band comparable use resistance-training machine activate exercised muscle , demonstrate electromyography ( EMG ) .25 Community-based training physiotherapist guide stroke survivor use Thera band® elastic band resistance train 16 week improve balance strength.26 In addition provide resistance , Thera band® use assist stroke survivor dorsiflexion gait training . Patients receive gait training use Thera band® show faster improvement mobility usual care.27 A guide , community-based model representative e-rehabilitation . Strength gait improvement comparable supervise unsupervised resistance training stroke survivors.23 This study 's record exercise video intend visually demonstrate aerobic resistance train community-dwelling patient . Although patient remain unsupervised , exercise session entirely guide trained exercise physiologist . This pilot , randomize , control , double-blinded study compare comprehensive lifestyle exercise rehabilitation intervention usual care patient acute stroke . The investigator study intend evaluate online exercise video rehabilitation program stroke survivor moderate disability compare usual care . The intervention video combine aerobic resistance training use latex resistance band , Thera band® elastic band , specifically design rehabilitation . The propose study perform Kaiser Permanente ( KP ) San Diego Medical Center . Kaiser Permanente patient admit acute ischemic stroke , result moderate disability , prior two week enrollment range recruit medical center . Patients directly offer participation study principal investigator , time hospital admission KP San Diego Medical Center ischemic stroke . For patient interested participate trial , screen base write inclusion exclusion criterion do review patient information electronic medical record system . If patient meet initial eligibility criterion , notify telephone . As part usual care , enrol patient initial study visit include within post-hospital discharge follow-up visit . Informed consent obtain time , well subsequent collection baseline data , include vital sign , social medical history , demographic variable , questionnaire response item . All patient appointment Positive Choice within two week initial visit education training , test ( aerobic capacity measure ) , distribution Thera band intervention group . Within subsequent week patient family intervention arm receive educational outreach call include medication reconciliation adherence , dietary adjustment , smoke cessation , physical activity , depression education , well access physical therapy video online . Videos 20-30 minute combination aerobic resistance train do seat position . Study staff call patient 1 week aforementioned educational phone call offer encouragement , ask progress , answer question patient may regard video . To control patient , call brief reminder continue adhere medical therapy . Study staff also call enrol patient screen depression 4-week interval , ensure coordination depression treatment primary care physician . Investigator perform physical exam include NIH stroke scale completion prescribe therapy . At time , patient advise continue physical activity video part AHA recommendation .
