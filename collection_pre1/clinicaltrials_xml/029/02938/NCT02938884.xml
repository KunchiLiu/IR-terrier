	<brief_title>Hidrate Me Smart Water Bottle Use Patient With Nephrolithiasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nephrolithiasis one common costly disease medicine affect nearly 10 % population . It also costly urologic disease estimate ten billion dollar per year associate healthcare expenditures towards treat condition . One big obstacle control grow incidence disease well preventative care , especially consider one third one half patient single stone event another stone within next ten fifteen year . Despite decade research preventative strategy reduce stone recurrence handful dietary medical treatment strong evidence support use . One cornerstones kidney stone prevention ensure adequate fluid intake . Without adequate hydration , urinary volume low turn increase super-saturation stone form salt increase likelihood stone formation . The best evidence support adequate fluid prevention strategy stone come Borghi et al . perform 5 year randomize control study find 12 % recurrence rate cohort patient encourage achieve goal 2 liter ( L ) urine per day compare 27 % recurrence group encourage increase fluid intake . Furthermore , recent guideline American Urological Association ( AUA ) American College Physicians ( ACP ) medical management kidney stone advocate goal urine volume 2.5 L stone former . Despite recommendation evidence support utility effective prevention mechanism stone former , achieve significant increase hydration subsequently urinary volume remain considerable clinical challenge . To date , adherence increase fluid recommendation understudy little data assess patient compliance specifically fluid . However , noncompliance metabolic treatment nephrolithiasis common estimate 50 % patient follow recommendations.These rate similar rate noncompliance recommend care chronic medical condition well include diabetes , chronic kidney disease , congestive heart failure , metabolic syndrome . Recently , mobile health technology receive much attention potential aide help improve compliance medically indicate lifestyle dietary treatment . Early study use `` smart technology '' mobile health application show implementation strategy beneficial improve compliance , also potential lead sustainable behavioral change . To date , study look mobile health technology applies increase fluid intake , particularly among stone former . Recently , novel `` smart '' water bottle call `` HidrateSpark '' ( www.hidratespark.com ) develop researcher University Minnesota develop use noninvasive fluid intake monitoring system . The device use capacitive touch sense via sensor extend lid base , calculate volume measurement detect change water level . Data bottle send wirelessly user ' smartphones application . This device significant potential use particularly among stone former demonstrate difficulty increase hydration part preventative care . The device would allow user ability closely monitor fluid intake throughout day , would also engage patient reminder drink periodically throughout day stay hydrate . Additionally , fluid intake measurement store associated application potential use novel metric capable bring provider 's attention order well ass guide patient hydration status identify barrier achieve hydration goal . The primary objective study would determine whether utilization technology improve adherence recommended increase hydration stone form patient low urine volume relative standard technique education read material . We hypothesize addition utilization smart water bottle standard recommendation lead measurable increase 24 hour urine output affect patient .</detailed_description>
