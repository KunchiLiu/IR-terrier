	<brief_summary>Melanoma aggressive skin cancer . Major advance metastatic melanoma treatment emerge new immunotherapy target specific immune inhibitory checkpoint receptor , mainly PD1 CTLA-4 , overcome exhaustion state T cell . In context , checkpoint inhibitor , Ipilimumab ( anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody , mAb ) Nivolumab Pembrolizumab ( anti-PD1 mAb ) , demonstrate survival benefit advance melanoma patient . Anti-PD1 agent combination anti-PD1 anti CTLA-4 approve first line therapy melanoma . However , predictive factor response immunotherapy remain far elusive . Recent study provide consistent evidence immune infiltration could test biomarker immunotherapy . Moreover , recent concept tumor neoantigens biomarkers response anti-CTLA-4 mAb , potentially also anti-PD1 combination therapy , promise need explore . In context , aim program identify validate immune signature predictive anti-PD-1 benefit treatment advance melanoma patient . To aim , tumor sample 120 melanoma patient enrol prospectively , treat anti-PD1 mAb alone combine anti CTLA4 , collect well correspond peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) . Tumor infiltration immune cell characterize paraffin embed melanoma sample . The investigator also perform whole-exome sequencing tumor match PBMC sample . Our primary objective develop combine immuno-signature base immuno-score ( CD3 , CD8 , CD45ROâ€¦ ) quantify situ immune population dedicate image analysis system combine simultaneous detection CD8-PD-1 PD-L1 immunofluorescence baseline tumor sample . This permit predict 1-year survival patient advance melanoma treat anti-PD1 transfer patient 's care . Our secondary objective : 1/ To assess interest detection tissue-resident memory ( TRM ) T cell ( CD8-CD103 ) predictive biomarker response survival 1-year ; 2/ To extend panel neoantigens publish Snyder et al neoantigens use next-generation sequencing ( NGS ) approach tumor sample obtain therapy ; 3/ To establish prognostic value panel neoantigens predict tumor response anti-PD1 1-year survival ; 4/ To functionally validate identified tumor neoantigens stimulate patient PBMC neoantigen peptide measure tumor-specific T-cell reactivity ; 5/ To define best marker and/or best combination marker predict overall response rate survival 12 18 month ; 6/ To attempt establish correlation immuno-signature neoepitopes 7/ To transfer immune signature routine basis validate . Thus , project integrate two complementary strategy define robust reliable score system predict anti-PD1 target immunotherapy response . This study provide unique opportunity validate various putative biomarkers integrated way could help determine respective value isolate parameter potentially lead definition composite biomarker . The identified immune signature would major interest field cancer immunotherapy order select manage patient treatment , consider benefice toxicity expect . It also help identify new target antigen effective antitumoral immune response understand resistance mechanism establish tumor influence response current immunotherapy .</brief_summary>
