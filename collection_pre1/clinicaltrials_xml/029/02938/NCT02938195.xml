	<brief_title>Phase II Study Neo-adjuvant Chemoradiotherapy Squamous Cell Esophageal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Esophageal cancer ( EC ) eighth common cancer world , 480,000 new case 400,000 death occur annually worldwide . In China , either new case death account half world . Morever , 90 % Chinese patient esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ( ESCC ) . Surgery main treatment disease , prognosis patient locally advanced esophageal cancer rather poor . As result surgery alone , 5-year survival rate 25 % change significantly several decade . Neo-adjuvant chemoradiotherapy follow surgery seem hopeful improve survival EC . Recently , CROSS trial demonstrate preoperative chemoradiotherapy significantly increase overall survival patient EC compare surgery alone . However , recent meta-analysis indicate increase risk postoperative mortality treatment-related mortality apparent ESCC treatment neo-adjuvant chemoradiotherapy . Compare surgery alone , advantage neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy reflect significantly high percentage R0 resection higher rate pathological complete response . Thus , investigator design new preoperative chemoradiotherapy regimen focus important radiation area hope reduce radiation volume try reduce postoperative mortality treatment-related mortality . Radiotherapy : Patients conduct CT simulation , three-dimensional radiation therapy Intensity-modulated radiation therapy perform . 1.8Gy/fraction , 5 fraction week , total dose 4140cgy delivered patient 6-MV-X-ray linear accelerator . Chemotherapy : Patients concurrently administer irradiation every 4 week PF regimen ( cis-platinum 25 mg/m2/d , d1-3 ; 5-fluorouracil 500mg/m2/d , d1-4 ) 2 cycle . Surgery : Patients receive operation 4-8 week chemoradiotherapy .</detailed_description>
