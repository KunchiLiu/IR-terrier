	<brief_summary>This study randomize , control multi-center clinical trial compare effect six month testosterone replacement therapy , without supervise exercise training , frail elderly female hip fracture patient . One third participant receive topical testosterone therapy supervise exercise training program ; one third receive topical placebo gel supervise exercise training program ; one third receive topical placebo gel home exercise program .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combining Testosterone Therapy Exercise Improve Function Post Hip Fracture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hip fracture common among old woman devastate impact ability remain independent . A clinically important functional decline failure recover follow hip fracture document much year fracture , even among individual function high level event . Age-associated androgen deficiency woman contribute deficit muscle mass , strength power common patient population fracture , exacerbate afterward . A pilot study testosterone ( T ) supplementation elderly female hip fracture patient demonstrate feasibility T treatment population , show gain lean body mass ( LBM ) muscle strength active drug , compare placebo . The benefit exercise restore muscle strength physical function hip fracture document . However , remain unclear whether T treatment augment effect exercise mobility patient-reported function , whether observed benefit sustain beyond period active treatment . Proposed 3-group , multi-center , randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blinded , parallel group clinical trial frail elderly female hip fracture patient . 300 female hip fracture patient enrol 6 clinical site , use objective screening criterion T deficiency ( serum total testosterone level &lt; 30 ng/dl ) physical frailty ( Modified Physical Performance Test ( PPT ) Score &lt; 28 ) . The trial compare effect supervise exercise training ( EX ) alone , EX combine T therapy ( EX+T ) EX placebo T treatment ( CON ) , ascertain incremental impact add T ET old adult woman follow hip fracture . The 6-month intervention follow 6-month no-treatment sustainability phase . The primary outcome measure Six Minute Walk Distance ( 6MWD ) . Secondary outcome measure include : 1 ) dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) measurement whole body appendicular LBM bone mineral density unfractured proximal femur ; 2 ) maximal skeletal muscle strength ( 1-RM ) leg extension limb ; 3 ) objective physical performance measure ; 4 ) self-reported performance activity daily live quality life , include Hip Rating Questionnaire ( HRQ ) . We plan carefully monitor testosterone level , adverse event , biochemical parameter , factor relate adherence intervention . Information study potential alter treatment hip fracture old woman , problem contributes significant morbidity mortality , large public health impact . The propose study highly align NIA 's mission identifying intervention target common geriatric condition , improve treatment option older adult multiple morbidity risk factor .</detailed_description>
