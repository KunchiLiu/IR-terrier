	<brief_summary>Purpose While strong evidence permethrin treat clothing prevents insect bite insufficient evidence trial demonstrate reduction infection . The evidence topical insect repellant prevent malaria robust , study civilian suffer poor compliance . It know added benefit combine two . The effectiveness permethrin-treated uniform without DEET lotion compare 2x2 design Mgambo Jeshi la Kujenga Taifa ( JKT ) military camp Tanga region . The four arm : 1 ) combine intervention group receive permethrin treat uniform ( PTU ) 30 % DEET ( diethyl toluamide ) liposome formula ; 2 ) permethrin intervention group receive PTU placebo lotion ; 3 ) DEET intervention group receive untreated army combat uniform ( ACU ) 30 % DEET liposome formula ; 4 ) placebo group receive untreated ACU placebo lotion . Both participant investigator blind treatment allocation . The outcome measure incidence Plasmodium falciparum malaria infection measure Polymerase Chain Reaction every month active case detection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study prospective , cluster-randomised placebo control trial use 4-arm non-inferiority design 12 month follow-up . Healthy recruit Tanzanian National Service Program JKT Mgambo Camp enrol trial . The recruit come Tanzania . The transmission camp relatively high : incidence malaria infection Mgambo camp among recruit last quarter 2014 0.68 per person per year measure RDT . One thousand five hundred recruit enrol trial . Randomisation base combania ( company , comprise typically 30-50 recruit ) . Recruits combania perform activity together group . The randomisation unequal since investigator expect primary comparison require great precision add DEET lotion PTU . Investigators randomise 500 recruit arm primary comparison ( PTU plus DEET , PTU uniform ) 250 recruit DEET placebo . Compliance maximise request participant use uniforms lotion night . Monitoring uniform use conduct random spot check participant evening study staff . In addition , bottle lotion weigh monthly basis active case detection direct measure compliance lotion use . Artemether-lumefantrine ( Co-Artem ) give participant temperature â‰¥37.5 degree centigrade history fever past 48h , P. falciparum parasite detect RDT absence detectable cause fever . The participant ' activity previous two week record questionnaire study staff active case detection . Time away camp sick bay prophylactic period case antimalarial treatment exclude time risk . Soldiers vulnerable group limit ability protect interest . It therefore , particularly important prevent involved research project feel duty may subject penalty senior member army . Therefore , order protect soldier coercion ethical review process research conduct process procedure require civilian Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) . In addition , service member ' commander supervisor may room consent process . It stress Tanzania People 's Defence Force ( TPDF ) staff perform spot check merely monitor compliance coerce participant wear uniform barrack</detailed_description>
