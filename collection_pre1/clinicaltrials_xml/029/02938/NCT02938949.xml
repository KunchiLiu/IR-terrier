	<brief_summary>Phase IV investigator initiate clinical trial study effectiveness alirocumab , inhibitor proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin ( PCSK9 ) , versus placebo add high-intensity statin ( atorvastatin 80 mg ) lower low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction ( NSTEMI ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Alirocumab Patients With Acute Myocardial Infarction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study effect early initiation alirocumab addition high intensity statin therapy patient previously treat high intensity statin poor response , present type I ( spontaneous ) acute NSTEMI . Patients dosed drug placebo first day hospital admission . Blood sample collect baseline , 3 day 14 day randomization biomarker test . Particular attention pay additional LDL lowering effect , well effect PCSK9 level inflammatory biomarkers . Safety tolerability monitor complete blood count + differential complete metabolic panel study visit .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Acute type I ( spontaneous ) NSTEMI define chest pain ( equivalent ) onset symptom within 12 hour presentation , duration &gt; 15 minute , elevate cardiac troponin I level , without electrocardiographic change [ exclusion ST elevation ] ; 2 . On medical therapy high intensity statin prior admission ( either atorvastatin 4080 mg rosuvastatin 2040 mg ) document hospital pharmacy record know LDL cholesterol ≥70 mg/dL within prior 12 month . 1 . Age &lt; 21 year age 2 . Inability give inform consent 3 . Previous , current plan treatment PCSK9 inhibitor 4 . Known history loss function PCSK9 ( genetic mutation sequence variation ) 5 . Patient homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia ( clinically previous genotyping ) 6 . Recent ( &lt; 14 day ) active use immunosuppressive drug ( include limit highdose corticosteroid [ &gt; 1mg/kg prednisone equivalent ] , Tumor Necrosis Factorα blocker , cyclosporine ) include nonsteroidal antinflammatory drug corticosteroid use IV dye allergy corticosteroid use replacement therapy pituitary/adrenal disease stable regimen least 6 week prior randomization ( note : topical , intraarticular , nasal , inhaled , ophthalmic steroid therapy consider `` systemic '' allow ) ; 7 . Chronic autoimmune autoinflammatory disease ( include limit rheumatoid arthritis , systemic lupus erythematosus ) ; 8 . History cancer within past 5 year , except adequately treat basal cell skin cancer , squamous cell skin cancer , situ cervical cancer ; 9 . Known chronic hepatitis B C infection ( exclude patient positive antibody successfully treat demonstrated viral load ) ; 10 . Known human immunodeficiency virus infection . 11 . Use fibrates fenofibrate within 6 week screen visit . 12 . Uncontrolled hypothyroidism . Note : patient thyroid replacement therapy include dosage thyroxin stable least 12 week prior screen . 13 . Known history hemorrhagic stroke . 14 . Has previously treat least 1 dose alirocumab antiPCSK9 monoclonal antibody clinical study . 15 . Conditions/situations : 1 . Any clinically significant abnormality identify time screen judgment investigator subinvestigator would preclude safe completion study constrain assessment endpoint , major systemic disease patient short life expectancy . 2 . Patients consider investigator subinvestigator inappropriate study reason : . Those patient deem unable meet specific protocol requirement , schedule visit . ii . Those patient investigator deem unable administer tolerate longterm injection . c. Investigator subinvestigator , pharmacist , study coordinator , study staff , relative thereof directly involve conduct protocol . d. Presence condition ( geographic social ) , actual anticipate , investigator feel would restrict limit patient 's participation duration study . 16 . Thyroidstimulating hormone ( TSH ) &lt; low limit normal ( LLN ) &gt; upper limit normal ( ULN ) ; TSH abnormal due control hypothyroidism ( patient stable dose thyroid replacement therapy ) , patient may enrol study ; 17 . Exclusion Criteria Related Active Comparator and/or Mandatory Background Therapies : All contraindication background therapy warnings/precautions use ( appropriate ) display respective national product labeling . 18 . Exclusion Criteria Related Current Knowledge Alirocumab 1 . Known hypersensitivity monoclonal antibody therapeutic 2 . Pregnant breastfeed woman 19 .
