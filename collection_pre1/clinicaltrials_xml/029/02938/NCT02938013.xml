	<detailed_description>Primary Objective : The primary objective estimate 1-week change proportion HCV-infected hepatocytes participant HCV monoinfection HIV/HCV coinfection therapy two three DAAs different mechanism action use single cell laser microdissection ( scLCM ) . Secondary Objectives : Estimate change first week plasma HCV RNA subject HCV monoinfected HIV/HCV coinfected participant therapy two three DAAs Estimate 1 week change amount HCV RNA per infect hepatocyte use scLCM liver biopsy specimen , obtain prior treatment initiation ( pre-treatment ) , first week DAA therapy . Estimate change proportion HCV-infected hepatocytes express interferon-stimulated gene ( ISGs ) within first week DAA therapy use scLCM . Measure change expression ISGs non-parenchymal intrahepatic immune cell ( Kupffer cell , plasmacytoid dendritic cell ) within first week DAA therapy use scLCM . Exploratory Objectives : Estimate 1 week change expression ISGs peripheral blood mononucleated cell ( PBMCs ) within first week DAA+ribavirin ( RBV ) therapy use scLCM . Compare sequence ( ) HCV protease , nonstructural protein 5A ( NS5A ) , nonstructural protein 5B ( NS5B ) depend peripheral sequence ) intrahepatic HCV RNA single cell bulk tissue , week 1 DAA+RBV therapy . Estimate week 1 change sizes number HCV-infected cluster DAA therapy test whether clearance HCV-infected hepatocytes occur spatially random pattern within specific cluster .</detailed_description>
