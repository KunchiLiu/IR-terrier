	<brief_title>Researching Emotions And Cardiac Health ( REACH ) : Phase II</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator propose study specifically innovatively focus development novel positive psychology intervention adapt patient HF . The MGH inpatient unit MGH Heart Center outpatient serve source subject study , patient diagnosis HF serve potential subject . The investigator enroll 10 HF patient , take part 10-week PP-based health behavior intervention . In project , investigator hope follow : 1 . Test 10-week , telephone-delivered health behavior intervention utilize PP exercise systematic goal-setting brief , non-randomized , proof-of-concept trial ( N=10 ) . 2 . Determine whether initial intervention feasible small cohort HF patient . 3 . Explore potential benefit intervention outcomes interest ( e.g. , optimism , positive affect ) . Baseline information enrol participant obtained patient , care provider , electronic medical record require characterization population . This information include data regard medical history ( history prior acute coronary syndrome , coronary artery bypass graft , congestive HF , hypertension , diabetes mellitus , hyperlipidemia , current smoking ) , current medical variable ( renal function , leave ventricular ejection fraction , NYHA class ) , medication , sociodemographic data ( age , gender , race/ethnicity , live alone ) . Participants go initial visit meet study staff person ( preferred phone ) . • They fill baseline questionnaire , provide treatment manual weekly exercise , along copy Learning Live Heart Failure . The PP goal-setting portion intervention introduce , first exercise assign . Finally , participant provide ActiGraph accelerometer wear 7 day , well personal step counter keep . Participants undergo weekly phone session 10 week . - For positive psychology segment participant review previous week 's exercise , discuss rationale next week 's exercise , assign next week 's exercise . - For goal-setting segment participant review health goal prior week , receive education health behavior , discus way improve health behavior , set goal next week . Participants undergo follow-up phone call 10 week asks question answer initial visit , well question experience use ActiGraph . • At Week 10 , participant wear another ActiGraph 7 day .</detailed_description>
