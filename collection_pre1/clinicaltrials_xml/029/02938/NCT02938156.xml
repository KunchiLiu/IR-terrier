	<brief_summary>Severe haemophilia A B ( SHA , SHB ) inherit bleed disorder affect male patient characterise low level circulate clot factor VIII IX respectively . Clinically low level present multiple recurrent bleeds joint muscle first couple year life . In addition patient may present spontaneous potentially fatal bleeding organ . The mainstay treatment replacement miss factor form intravenous injection factor VIII IX . Clotting factor give treat bleed give prevent bleed , latter term prophylaxis . Regular prophylaxis current standard care aim decrease spontaneous bleed event result joint damage , require patient self-infuse factor vein two four time week . Patient 's compliance prescribe regimen recommendation significant influence outcome . Advances biomolecular protein engineering extend duration effect clot factor VIII IX multiple mechanism . This extension duration effect present clinician patient opportunity tailor treatment particular need , circumstance body characteristic . It suggest decrease frequency infusion improve adherence thus contribute improved outcome . In rare disorder , accept fact post-marketing study crucial understand generalisability efficacy safety outcome identify new safety efficacy concern relation specific population group .
