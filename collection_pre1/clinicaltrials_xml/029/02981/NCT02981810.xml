	<brief_title>Evaluation Coblation Channeling Treatment Chronic Tonsillitis .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The palatine tonsil consist epithelial crypt ( invaginated pocket ) surround dense cluster lymph nodule , germinal center lymphocytes proliferate . The nodule embed mass diffuse lymphoid tissue consist lymphocytes migrate germinal center . Increasing surface area crypt one way facilitate contact antigen ( bacteria ) immune cell . The epithelium may specialize form openmeshwork cell allow infiltration epithelium lymphocytes macrophage . Tonsillar lymphoid nodule consist mainly B-lymphocytes . Other area occupy T-lymphocytes , activate B-lymphocytes cell immune system . Inside crypt , cell immune system often invade epithelium , difficult find specific boundary epithelium lymphoid tissue . The bacterial material biofilms1 sit crypt may start new infection time time . The epithelium line crypt corresponds adjacent surface - stratify squamous tongue palate pseudo stratify columnar pharynx . In either case , epithelium may heavily infiltrate lymphocyte , crypt may fill lymphocyte debris . The tonsillar crypt important role chronic tonsillitis . They cover stratified epithelium may initiate via epithelium mount immune response various present antigen . Go M. et al , investigated expression function tight junction epithelium human palatine tonsils patient tonsillar hypertrophy recurrent tonsillitis . These study suggest unique expression tight junction human palatine tonsillar epithelium , suggest crypt epithelium may possess epithelial barrier different surface epithelium2 . Bacteria within biofilms resistant host defense antibiotic . The presence bacterial biofilms within tissue crypt inflame tonsil may explain chronic recurrent characteristic form tonsillitis . There strong anatomical evidence presence bacterial biofilms chronically diseased tonsils1 . Using novel visualization approach single section human mucosal tissue , presence biofilms demonstrate tonsil ( 17/24 [ 70.8 % ] ) patient tonsillitis3 . One study investigate difference follicle size number tonsils patient tonsillar hypertrophy recurrent tonsillitis use image analysis method . There significant difference mean follicle number per count field recurrent tonsillitis tonsillar hypertrophy . However , demonstrate tonsillar hypertrophy characterize histologically enlargement follicle compare recurrent tonsillitis , indicate hyperplastic condition lymphoid cell germinal center . It may also explain difference etiology immune mechanism tonsillar hypertrophy recurrent tonsillitis4 . Coblation non-heat driven process radiofrequency energy apply conductive medium ( usually saline ) cause highly focused plasma field form around electrodes . The plasma field comprise highly ionized particle . These ionized particle sufficient energy break organic molecular bond within tissue . Instead explode tissue , coblation cause low-temperature molecular disintegration , result minimal tissue damage surround area . A novel treatment chronic tonsillitis suggest inventor , method base treat source recurrent bacterial infection tonsillar tissue , specifically tonsillar crypt . By treatment crypt tonsillar tissue may possible decrease possible antigen-immune system interaction inflammation . Without bound specific theory , suggest combination radio frequency energy fluid create `` plasma '' field contain highly ionized particle , sufficient energy break organic molecular bond remove tissue selectively without excessive heat production damage surround tissue . Material Methods The study protocol approve The Hillel Yaffe Medical Center 's Ethics Helsinki Committee . 60 patient suffer chronic tonsillitis treat Coblation channel tonsil . The treatment conduct use ArthrocareÂ® Corporation ( ArthroCare Corporation , 7500 Rialto Boulevard Austin , Texas 78735 ) COBLATION electrode ReFlex Ultra 55* tonsillar tissue ablation low temperatures one treatment . All patient underwent tonsil channel treatment coblation , 4-6 channel do tonsil local anesthesia , operate room . The patient observe overnight . A control group include 60 patient chronic tonsillitis indication tonsillectomy underwent tonsillectomy . The patient select old 18 year old , healthy , without chronic disease chronic tonsillitis . Diagnosis chronic tonsillitis base history medical examination . The criterion : 1 . At least 4 occasion tonsillitis last year treat ( positive throat swab Streptococci Group A contribute towards diagnosis ) . 2 . Recurrent chronic throat pain . 3 . Hypertrophic tonsils chronic tonsillitis . Patients include : 1 . Disease mouth pharyngeal mucosa-like ulcer . 2 . Allergy drug . 3 . Gastrointestinal reflux . 4 . Any contraindication tonsillectomy . 5 . Peritonsillar abscess past . Final evaluation follow-up patient 1,2,4,6 12 month begin treatment . At visit , evaluation treatment do investigate degree throat pain tonsillitis treatment , number tonsillitis per year , examination tonsil , post treatment pain score VISUAL-ANALOG-SCALE ( VAS ) SCORES . The following parameter record : size tonsil treatment , number occurrence tonsillitis one year , post-treatment bleeding . The result statistically evaluate .</detailed_description>
