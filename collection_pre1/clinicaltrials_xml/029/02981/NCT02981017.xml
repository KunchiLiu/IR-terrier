	<brief_summary>We propose randomize , single-blinded , prospective trial order evaluate efficacy Cook Biodesign ENT Repair graft improve outcome Draf III Endoscopic Modified Lothrop procedure . The Cook Biodesign ENT Repair graft porcine intestinal submucosal xenograft FDA approve use adjunct natural heal process sinonasal cavity . The Draf III Endoscopic Modified Lothrop involve create large unified drainage pathway refractory frontal sinusitis . After procedure complete , expose bone along frontal beak region become nidus inflammation , crust eventual scarring , lead stenosis even complete blockage frontal sinus . The Cook Biodesign use cover expose bone order potentially reduce inflammation , crust scar possibly improve outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Improvement Outcomes Draf III/Endoscopic Modified Lothrop Procedure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic rhinosinusitis ( CRS ) inflammatory disorder affect sinonasal mucosa . Chronic symptom include facial pain pressure , nasal airway obstruction , anosmia nasal discharge ( sometimes purulent ) , addition significant effect overall quality life . The cost CRS estimate approximately $ 4 billion per year result 20 million physician visit per year . The frontal sinus pair paranasal sinus house superiorly anteriorly frontal bone side , separate inter-sinus septum contiguous nasal septum . The frontal sinus , like paranasal sinus , affect chronic rhinosinusitis , inflammation frontal sinus outflow tract cause obstruction subsequent symptom . First line therapy involve medical therapy often combination antibiotic , nasal saline irrigation , topical and/or systemic corticosteroid , endoscopic sinus surgical therapy reserve patient persistent symptom medical therapy . Surgical therapy frontal sinus technically demand aspect endoscopic sinus surgery , due , surgical dissection frontal sinus discourage past . Otolaryngology textbooks also emphasize chronic frontal sinus disease may relate unnecessary instrumentation frontal recess . With recent advance endoscopic sinus surgery advent balloon sinusotomy , rate frontal sinus surgery double 2000 2009 . Primary frontal sinus surgery approach balloon dilation endoscopic sinusotomy . Endoscopic sinusotomy frontal sinus involve increase size frontal recess anterior ethmoidectomy removal agger nasi cell anteriorly , frontal cell may present . Frontal sinus surgery effective , evidence recent study analyze long-term result primary frontal sinus surgery show patency rate 92 % nearly 2-year average follow period . Refractory frontal sinusitis address surgically external 'extended ' endonasal approach . Historically , external approach first utilized , introduction osteoplastic flap technique Brieger 1890s . Lothrop introduce Lothrop Procedure 1914 require osteoplastic flap removal frontal sinus floor intersinus septum along upper aspect nasal septum create unified drainage pathway frontal sinus . In 1950s , Montgomery popularize frontal sinus obliteration osteoplastic flap approach leave frontal sinus permanently non-functional obliteration fat material . Though external approach often high success rate , require extensive dissection associate high morbidity complication rate upwards 20 % . These complication include dural exposure , dural laceration cerebrospinal fluid leak , orbital injury , forehead numbness , osteomyelitis mucocele formation . In 1991 , Wolfgang Draf describe endoscopic approach create common drainage pathway akin Lothrop procedure call Endoscopic Modified Lothrop ( EMLP ) Draf III procedure . Currently , EMLP provide endoscopic alternative persistent frontal sinus disease initial frontal sinusotomy , prior consideration frontal sinus obliteration osteoplastic flap approach . The EMLP involve drill frontal sinus ostia side combine superior septectomy , create large common drainage pathway two frontal sinus . The EMLP offer reduce morbidity , short hospital stay , improve cosmetic , reduce blood loss preservation functional frontal sinus . One meta-analysis study 18 observational study show restenosis rate 19 % overall failure rate 13.9 % ( failure define require revision surgery ) , failure rate range 0-33 % . Restenosis frontal sinus ostium EMLP often attribute combination scarring , adhesion neo-osteogenesis , occur secondary expose bone surgical procedure . The exposed osteitic bone believe act source inflammation osteoblastic activity . Persistent mucosal disease also postulate contributor postoperative stenosis EMLP . Prevention restenosis attempt use stent medical therapy topical application mitomycin C steroid variable result . Recent study attempt address issue use mucosal graft cover expose frontal bone EMLP . These study describe use free pedicled mucosal graft various site nasal cavity cover bare bone expose EMLP drill procedure . Two study report result use free mucosal graft cover expose bone show encouraging result , patency rate 95 % 100 % . Another study use pedicled flap base anterior ethmoidal artery show restenosis 4 patient . These study utilize mucosa mostly nasal septum region superior septectomy would otherwise discard , also report use inferior turbinate mucosa harvesting . Though minimal morbidity relate mucosal harvest report , mucosal harvest site operative site potential create additional postoperative morbidity . In addition , use mucosa diseased mucosal cavity may optimal . Reducing rate restenosis failure EMLP allow improve outcome follow procedure may prevent progression invasive extensive surgical procedure . This study utilize proprietary porcine intestinal submucosa graft Cook Biodesign™ ENT Repair graft cover expose bone nasofrontal beak region follow EMLP order evaluate effect mucosal heal reduction restenosis rate surgically augment frontal sinus ostium Endoscopic Modified Lothrop Procedure . The Cook Biodesign™ ENT Repair nasal mucosal replacement use sinonasal surgery since Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approval 2013 . The Cook Biodesign™ ENT Repair graft FDA approve prescription use `` separate tissue structure compromise surgical trauma , help control minimal bleeding , act adjunct aid natural healing process . The device indicate use open wound dress material require nasal and/or sinus cavity follow nasal and/or sinus surgery separation tissue structure desire . '' The use xenograft material method propose submission study extensively . However , use free mucosal graft pedicled mucosal flap EMLP previously discuss , show promise . The Cook Biodesign™ use preliminarily patient propose set good anecdotal result , include reduce crust good postoperative outcome , however , use yet formally evaluate . The Cook Biodesign™ graft several advantage use native mucosal graft : readily available require harvest thus reduce operative time potential morbidity mucosa harvest site , thinner sinus mucosa handle ease , tissue characteristic promote wound heal . With Cook Biodesign™ , hypothesis use EMLP surgery allow reduction expose bone sinonasal cavity thus reduce inflammation , crust ultimately reduce restenosis failure rate . Additionally , hypothesize reduction crust inflammation lead improve patient report symptom quality life score Sinonasal Outcomes Test-22 ( SNOT-22 ) questionnaire .</detailed_description>
