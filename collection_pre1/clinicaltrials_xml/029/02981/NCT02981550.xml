	<detailed_description>Community acquire , hospital acquire [ nosocomial ] infection [ pathogen ] common cause morbidity mortality . Initiation antibiotic treatment best guess use broad spectrum antibiotic . The improper administration antibiotic know lead develop specter antibiotic resistant organism . Certain community acquire bacterial infection Streptococcus upper respiratory tract infection carry increase risk morbidity secondary risk develop abscess , glomerulonephritis , and/or rheumatic fever . Commonly , upper respiratory tract infection cause virus . However due unknown pathogen cause upper respiratory tract infection , risk potential chronic severe complication Streptococcus , initial treatment start either antibiotic , typical 3day wait bacterial culture result . Quite often , wait-and-see approach community undertake difficulty return follow-up appointment . The risk develop antibiotic resistant bacteria well-known one great health threat worldwide lead long hospitalization , high medical cost death , accord World Health Organization . Thus point care device would enable physician medical practitioner promptly discriminate Streptococcal antibiotic sensitive pathogen versus non antibiotic sensitive viral cause specific upper respiratory tract infectious pathogen need .</detailed_description>
