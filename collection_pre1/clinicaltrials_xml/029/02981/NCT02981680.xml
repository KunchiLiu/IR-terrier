	<brief_summary>Background : Acute kidney injury ( AKI ) follow coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) surgery major complication occur 1 % 53 % patient ( depend define ) pool rate 18.2 % unfortunately 2.1 % require renal replacement therapy . Cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) -associated AKI increase mortality 2-4 fold regardless AKI definition . It also associate increase risk postoperative stroke , acute myocardial infarction , cardiac tamponade , heart failure , lengthen intensive care unit hospital stay . Even minor elevation postoperative serum creatinine ( SCr ) associate significant increase 30-day mortality , 3-fold increase risk small elevation 0.5 mg/dL baseline 18-fold increase risk death SCr rise great 0.5 mg/dL . The pathogenesis CPB-associated AKI complicate include hemodynamic , inflammatory mechanism interact cellular level . To date , despite several clinical trial pharmacologic intervention , none demonstrate conclusively efficacy prevention AKI cardiac surgery . Remote ischemic preconditioning ( RIPC ) phenomenon brief ischemia one organ tissue , provokes protective effect reduce mass infarction cause vessel occlusion reperfusion . In CABG surgery , cardiomyocyte injury cause myocardial protection failure predominantly responsible adverse outcome . RIPC show reduce troponin release 24 h postoperatively child undergo corrective surgery congenital heart disease . Other study demonstrate RIPC use brief ischemia reperfusion upper limb reduces myocardial injury adult patient undergo CABG surgery . Due similarity mechanisms ischemia-reperfusion injury produce RIPC propose AKI CPB , decide test hypothesis RIPC prevents AKI patient undergo CABG surgery . Methods : 170 patient fulfill inclusion exclusion criterion divide case control group ( 85 patient case 85 patient control group ) . Patients treatment group receive three sequential sphygmomanometer cuff inflation right upper arm induction anesthesia operating room . The cuff inflate OR nurse 200 mmHg five minute occasion , five minute deflation inflation . Following pre-conditioning phase , surgery start . The entire pre-conditioning phase last 30 minute . Patients control group sphygmomanometer cuff place right upper arm , cuff inflate . Similar patient treatment group , patient control group undergo 30 minute delay start surgery . Complete blood count ( CBC ) , SCr , liver function test ( LFT ) , prothrombin time ( PT ) , partial thromboplastin time ( PTT ) urine analysis ( U/A ) check surgery . After surgery , complete blood count ( CBC ) SCr check daily . If AKI occur , manage dialysis do patient require . All patient undergo electrocardiogram , LFT , electrolytes , prothrombin time ( PT ) , partial thromboplastin time ( PTT ) CABG surgery hospital course</brief_summary>
