	<brief_title>Oculomotor Training Improves Reading Eye Movement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose study Reading one integral element learn poor reader report less efficient read eye movement . They typically characterize high number fixation regression , reduce read speed perceptual span . The purpose study investigate vision therapy limit training oculomotor skill improve read eye movement . Methodology This randomize , prospective study . 30 subject age 8-9 year age reading difficulty read eye movement problem recruit . They normal intelligence ocular health , fail meet Taylor read eye movement norm test Visagraph III . The subject randomly assign either treatment group ( 15 ) control group ( 15 ) . The treatment group go course oculomotor vision therapy control group give placebo exercise . Vision therapy treatment group involve 8 week training ( office training - 3 time week , 30 min per session ; home training - 4 time week , 30 min per session ) . Office training involve use Vis-Flex ( Visual Flexibility Trainer - electronic device L.E.D . light display various flash pattern variable speed ) . Home training involve several saccadic eye movement exercise . Subjects parent also ask grade reading symptom checklist training .</detailed_description>
