	<brief_title>Higher Enjoyment Response High Intensity Interval Training Versus Moderate Intensity Continuous Exercise</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Twelve men woman habitually active initially perform ramp exercise cycle ergometer ass maximal oxygen uptake ( VO2max ) peak power output ( PPO ) , use determine workload subsequent 2 bout . They return least 48 h late time day complete high intensity interval training ( HIIT consist repeat 1 min bout 85 % PPO ) moderate intensity continuous training ( MICT consist 25 min 40 % PPO ) . During exercise , heart rate , oxygen uptake , perceive exertion , pleasure : displeasure , blood lactate concentration continuously assess . Ten minute post-exercise , physical activity enjoyment measure . Data show despite high oxygen uptake , heart rate , blood lactate concentration , perceive exertion HIIT , enjoyment high HIIT versus MICT .</detailed_description>
