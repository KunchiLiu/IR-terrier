	<brief_title>Inotuzumab Ozogamicin Treating Younger Patients With Relapsed Refractory CD22 Positive B Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine morphologic response rate ( complete response [ CR ] + complete response incomplete hematologic recovery [ CRi ] ) follow one cycle treatment inotuzumab ozogamicin ( InO ) child relapse refractory CD22+ B acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( B-ALL ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine CR/CRi rate follow 2 cycle InO therapy . II . To determine safety single agent InO administer adult recommend phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) pediatric patient relapse refractory CD22+ B-ALL . III . To determine level minimal residual disease ( MRD ) flow cytometry respond patient . IV . To determine incidence , severity , outcomes sinusoidal obstruction syndrome/veno-occlusive disease ( SOS/VOD ) liver patient InO therapy follow subsequent treatment , include myeloablative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) . V. To estimate 3-year event-free survival ( EFS ) , 3-year overall survival ( OS ) , among responder duration CR/CRi pediatric patient relapse refractory B-ALL treat InO . OUTLINE : Patients receive inotuzumab ozogamicin intravenously ( IV ) 60 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day , every 3 month 1 year , yearly 4 year .</detailed_description>
