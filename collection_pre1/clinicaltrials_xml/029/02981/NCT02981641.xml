	<detailed_description>The trial fund National High-tech R &amp; D Program ( 863 Program ) . The trial prepare registered clinicaltrail.gov . Quality assurance plan : Every participant enrol exclude two practiced investigator . And two investigator participate step trail , include record data , investigator compare data . If data consistent , investigator would record data ; , data would check decide two investigator . All step data site monitor audited worker research financial department The First Affiliated Hospital China Medical University Data check : The investigator compare data enter registry predefined rule range consistency data field registry . Source data verification ass accuracy , completeness , representativeness registry data compare data external data source , include medical record electronic case report form . Data dictionary contains detailed description variable used registry , include source variable , cod information , normal range relevant . Standard Operating Procedures address registry operation analysis activity , participant recruitment , data collection , data management , data analysis , report adverse event , change management .

The investigator recruit 120 participant every year accord previous experience , investigator recruit least one year . Plan miss data : The investigator would collect much data possible , investigator exclude participant cooperate recruitment . And investigator manage situation accord statistical principle variable report miss , unavailable , `` non-reported , '' uninterpretable , consider miss data inconsistency out-of-range result . Statistical analysis plan : Kaplan-Meier method would use analyze difference survival time two group , local control rate two group would compare chi square test . Statistical analysis would perform use IBM SPSS Statistics ( version 20 ; IBM , Chicago , USA ) . The level significance define P &lt; 0.05 .</detailed_description>
