	<brief_summary>The current management tricuspid regurgitation ( TR ) either conservative ( medication ) surgery , usually concomitant valve repair replacement . TR worsen appear late successful mitral valve surgery portend poor prognosis .However , standard surgical approach require cardiopulmonary bypass especially second surgery excessive risk . Thus many patient deny surgery unfavorable risk-benefit balance . Therefore need novel device enable interventional cardiologist cardiothoracic surgeon perform tricuspid annuloplasty transcatheter method . Cardioband replicate establish surgical technique ( e.g. , annuloplasty ) use transfemoral approach , without suture adjust beat heart . Similar approve indication mitral annuloplasty . The Cardioband System expect allow treatment patient would otherwise undergo Tricuspid valve repair due invasiveness current technique . The Cardioband Transcatheter System ( Cardioband ) market system approve treatment secondary ( functional ) mitral regurgitation ( FMR ) ( CE grant September 2015 ) . The Cardioband annuloplasty band similar surgical annuloplasty , however deploy beat heart transvenous approach . The CE mark study 30 subject complete documented significant reduction severity MR improvement quality life Minnesota live heart failure questionnaire ( MLHFQ ) , Ney York Heart Association ( NYHA ) 6- minute walk test ( 6MWT ) , subject moderate severe MR . The aim current study evaluate Cardioband annuloplasty system repair Tricuspid Regurgitation .</brief_summary>
