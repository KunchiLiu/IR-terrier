	<brief_title>Synchronized Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation PTSD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) highly prevalent psychiatric disorder associate high degree comorbidity ( e.g. , major depressive disorder ) , poor quality life , significant social occupational dysfunction . Currently available evidence-based pharmacological psychological treatment PTSD modest efficacy , thus research necessary develop treatment approach order ameliorate current disparity disorder impact prevalence , effective therapy . The use non-invasive neuromodulation technique , repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) , outpatient setting , show effective reducing symptom various mental disorder , include PTSD major depressive disorder ( MDD ) . Research examine use rTMS PTSD still remain limited , majority finding pertain rTMS MDD cohort , exclude individual PTSD . Given high rate PTSD MDD comorbidity , additional study examine comorbid population necessary . Furthermore , rTMS treatment parameter duration rather time consume patient , require patient travel outpatient facility daily , 6 8 week , 30 40 minute day . This inconvenience pose additional burden individual already struggle societal integration social/occupational dysfunction . Thus , exploration development non-invasive brain stimulatory device ( good ) effectiveness rTMS , adapt utilized home setting , would revolutionize treatment PTSD . The synchronized transcranial magnetic stimulation ( sTMS , NeoSync Inc. ) device provide possibility fore mention therapeutic development . The sTMS device employ 3 transversely rotate , deliver low energy , sinusoidal magnetic field synchronize individual ' intrinsic alpha frequency ( IAF ) . Preliminary data show sTMS effectively reduce depressive symptom MDD . Additionally , investigator ' preliminary examination IAF participant comorbid PTSD depressive symptom , illuminated feasibility modality treatment approach PTSD comorbid MDD . This study prospective , sham-controlled , trial sTMS deliver patient symptomatic despite ongoing pharmacotherapy PTSD mood symptom . Eligible subject randomize use receive 4 week ( 5 daily session per week ) either sham active sTMS treatment . Clinical self-report assessment complete baseline , sham/control series endpoint , 1 month final treatment session . An optional open-label continuation phase offer study participant complete sham-control phase study , additional endpoint assessment administer .</detailed_description>
