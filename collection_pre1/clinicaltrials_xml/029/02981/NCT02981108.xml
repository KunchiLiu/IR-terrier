	<brief_summary>This Phase 1/2 , open-label , multicenter study HS-10296 dose escalation , dose expansion extension cohort locally advance metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) patient progress follow prior therapy epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) agent . The study design evaluate safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) , anti-tumor activity once-daily orally ( PO ) administer HS-10296 . The overall study design show flow chart , consist 3 phase : dose escalation , dose expansion extension cohort .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Provision sign date write informed consent prior studyspecific procedure , sample , analysis . If patient decline participate voluntary exploratory research and/or genetic component study , penalty loss benefit patient he/she exclude aspect study . 2 . Age least 18 year . 3 . Histological cytological confirmation diagnosis NSCLC . 4 . Radiological documentation disease progression previous continuous treatment EGFR TKI , e.g. , gefitinib erlotinib . In addition , line therapy may give . All patient must document radiological progression last treatment administer , prior enrol study . 5 . Patients must fulfill one following : Confirmation tumor harbor EGFR mutation know associated EGFR TKI sensitivity ( include G719X , exon 19 deletion , L858R , L861Q ) OR must experience clinical benefit EGFR TKI , accord Jackman criterion ( follow systemic objective progression ( RECIST World Health Organization [ WHO ] ) continuous treatment EGFR TKI . 6 . For dose expansion extension cohort , patient also must confirmation tumor T790M+ mutation status biopsy sample take disease progression recent treatment regimen EGFR TKI . Prior entry , result central analysis patient 's T790M mutation status must obtain . 7 . World Health Organization ( WHO ) performance status equal 01 deterioration previous 2 week minimum life expectancy 12 week . 8 . At least 1 lesion previously irradiate , choose biopsy study Screening period , accurately measure Baseline ≥ 10mm long diameter ( except lymph node must short axis ≥ 15mm ) computerize tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , suitable accurately repeat measurement . 9 . Females childbearing potential use adequate contraceptive measure throughout study , breast feeding time screening , study 3 month completion study , must negative pregnancy test prior start dose childbearing potential must evidence nonchildbearing potential fulfil 1 follow criterion screen : Postmenopausal define age 50 year amenorrheic least 12 month follow cessation exogenous hormonal treatment . Women 50 year old would consider postmenopausal amenorrheic 12 month , follow cessation exogenous hormonal treatment , luteinizing hormone ( LH ) folliclestimulating hormone ( FSH ) level postmenopausal range laboratory . Documentation irreversible surgical sterilization hysterectomy , bilateral oophorectomy , bilateral salpingectomy , tubal ligation . 10 . Male patient willing use barrier contraception ( i.e. , condom ) . 11 . For dose expansion pair biopsy cohort : Presence least 1 nontarget lesion suitable multiple biopsy treatment . 12 . For inclusion optional genetic research , patient must provide write informed consent genetic research . 1 . Treatment follow : An EGFR TKI ( e.g. , erlotinib , gefitinib , osimertinib ) within 8 day approximately 5 time halflife specific drug , whichever longer , first dose study treatment . ( If sufficient washout time occur due schedule PK property , alternative appropriate washout time base know duration time reversibility drugrelated adverse event must agree upon Hansoh Investigator ) . Any cytotoxic chemotherapy , investigational agent , anticancer drug advance NSCLC use previous treatment regimen clinical study within 14 day first dose study treatment . Major surgery ( exclude placement vascular access ) within 4 week first dose study treatment . Radiotherapy limit field radiation palliation within 1 week first dose study treatment , exception patient receive radiation 30 % bone marrow wide field radiation must complete within 4 week first dose study treatment . 2 . Previously untreated NSCLC patient . To eligible study , patient must receive progressed EGFR TKI therapy . 3 . Any unresolved toxicity prior therapy great Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) , Grade 1 , time start study treatment exception alopecia Grade 2 , prior platinumtherapy relate neuropathy . 4 . Spinal cord compression brain metastasis unless asymptomatic , stable , require steroid least 4 week prior start study treatment . 5 . Any evidence severe uncontrolled systemic disease , include uncontrolled hypertension active bleeding diatheses , , Investigator 's opinion , make undesirable patient participate trial OR would jeopardize compliance protocol active infection ( e.g. , hepatitis B , hepatitis C human immunodeficiency virus [ HIV ] ) . Screening chronic condition require . 6 . Any following cardiac criterion : Mean rest correct QT interval ( QTc ) &gt; 470 msec obtain 3 electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) , use Screening clinic ECG machine Fridericia 's formula QT interval correction . Any clinically important abnormality rhythm , conduction , morphology rest ECG ( e.g. , complete leave bundle branch block , thirddegree heart block , seconddegree heart block , PR interval &gt; 250msec ) . Any factor increase risk QTc prolongation risk arrhythmic event heart failure , hypokalemia , congenital long QT syndrome , family history long QT syndrome unexplained sudden death 40 year age first degree relative concomitant medication know prolong QT interval . 7 . Past medical history interstitial lung disease , druginduced interstitial lung disease , radiation pneumonitis require steroid treatment , evidence clinically active interstitial lung disease . 8 . Inadequate bone marrow reserve organ function demonstrate follow laboratory value : Absolute neutrophil count &lt; 1.5 x 109/L . Platelet count &lt; 100 x 109/L . Hemoglobin &lt; 90 g/L ( &lt; 9 g/dL ) . Alanine aminotransferase &gt; 2.5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) demonstrable liver metastasis &gt; 5 time ULN presence liver metastasis . Aspartate aminotransferase &gt; 2.5 time ULN demonstrable liver metastasis &gt; 5 time ULN presence liver metastasis . Total bilirubin &gt; 1.5 time ULN liver metastases &gt; 3 time ULN presence document Gilbert 's Syndrome ( unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia ) liver metastasis . Creatinine &gt; 1.5 time ULN concurrent creatinine clearance &lt; 50 mL/min ( measure calculate Cockcroft Gault equation ) ; confirmation creatinine clearance require creatinine &gt; 1.5 time ULN . 9 . Refractory nausea , vomit , chronic gastrointestinal disease , inability swallow study medication , previous significant bowel resection would preclude adequate absorption HS10296 . 10 . History hypersensitivity active inactive ingredient HS10296 drug similar chemical structure class HS10296 . 11 . Women breast feeding . 12 . Involvement study plan conduct ( i.e. , Hansoh staff staff study site ) . 13 . Judgment Investigator patient participate study patient unlikely comply study procedure , restriction , requirement . 14 . Any disease condition , opinion Investigator , would compromise safety patient interfere study assessment . 15 . The following consider criterion exclusion exploratory genetic research : Previous allogenic bone marrow transplant . Nonleukocyte leukocytedepleted whole blood transfusion within 120 day date genetic sample collection .</criteria>
