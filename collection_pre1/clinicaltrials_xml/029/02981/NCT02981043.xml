	<brief_summary>Clinical study far limited , large volume multi-center study study need . The purpose pilot study look clinical correlation aggressivity panel develop biomarkers think affect progression aggressivity endometriosis , pain quality life . Our goal study find correlation `` aggressivity '' endometriosis clinical factor determine study questionnaire . The `` aggressivity panel '' pioneer EndoDiag lab France , create use marker think affect activity progression endometriosis . This information could lead good understanding disease , ultimately lead targeted therapy . If patient return second surgery ask permission use slide first seconed surgery compare . The tissue remove surgery standard care make slide research study ( endometrial biopsy perform research purpose second surgery ) . The slide surgery 1 &amp; surgery 2 compare . If clinical correlation find aggressivity panel , goal would create local lab tissue bank United States could provide basis collaborative national ( even international ) research . Also , correlation find , future investigation look correlation aggressivity panel fertility outcomes . Results pilot study help direct study treatment protocols various stage aggressivity endometriosis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study design investigator-initiated pilot , prospective cohort study ( Canadian Task Force , II-3 ) . Patients randomize . Consecutive subject age 14-55 recruit include study seek treatment pain suspect known endometriosis . Patients menopausal ( either chemically-induced , natural surgical ) include study . Patients pregnant eligible surgery , eligible study . Subjects exclude find endometriosis confirm histology . All surgery perform single institution , St. Mary 's Hospital . An ad hoc sample size calculation possible pilot study , since historic data base calculation . The goal acquire 45 panel result , reasonable amount data pilot study , give funding available . Quality life ( measure 100-point scale EHP-5 ) pain index ( measure VAS scale ) measure six different time point : surgery , six month surgery , one year surgery . At time point compare quality life pain index across four aggressivity group low , moderate , medium , high use analysis variance ( ANOVA ) non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test depend normality distribution . Pairwise comparison also make use independent student test non-parametric Kolmogorov-Smirnov test depend normality distribution . The follow-up time frame surgery 1 year . Patients receive questionnaire pre op 6-months 1 year first surgery second surgery ( need ) . The entire study take 4 year , include data analysis publication . . This study relate IRB # 20900 . Subjects consent participate study may also consent participate 20900 . The pre-operative follow-up questionnaire , standardized tool relate QOL depression IRB # 20900 .</detailed_description>
