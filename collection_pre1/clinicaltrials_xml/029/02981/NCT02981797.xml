	<brief_summary>This prospective biomarker study prostate cancer patient receive Radium 223 standard care . Participants take part research study choose Radium 223 treatment prostate cancer spread bone causing pain . Investigators want find blood test perform Radium 223 treatment help understand prostate cancer cell react therapy . In pilot study , researcher want find Radium 223 give part standard treatment prostate cancer decrease number circulate prostate cancer cell . Radium 223 kill prostate cancer cell damage DNA . Other look change number circulate prostate cancer cell Radium 223 , researcher would also like look change DNA damage marker , call gamma H2AX , circulate prostate cancer cell treatment Radium 223 . Assessing DNA damage marker gamma H2AX investigational . It perform tube blood use assess change number circulate prostate cancer cell .</brief_summary>
