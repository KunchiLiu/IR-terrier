	<brief_summary>The purpose study address need efficient informative measurement evaluate adolescent Screening , Brief Intervention , Referral Treatment ( SBIRT ) strategy . The investigator undertake longitudinal cohort study build validate substance specific measurement battery include patient-centered intermediary outcome integrate range healthcare research setting . The result project enable evaluation SBIRT trial clinical effort validate parsimonious set measurement tool incorporate electronic health record . The primary goal propose project develop set brief , valid tool allow researcher clinician collect information enables evaluate refining brief intervention . The main objective define disseminate set brief easy administer measure accurately detect 1 ) substance use frequency , 2 ) substance-specific patient center outcomes 3 ) intermediate measure impact adolescent SBIRT . The specific aim address project develop administer assessment battery include novel question assess substance use validate criterion standard measure cross-sectionally longitudinally .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A policy level mandate exist deliver screening , brief intervention , referral treatment ( SBIRT ) adolescents primary care . This mandate spur imperative reduce enormous preventable morbidity mortality cause adolescent substance use . Despite mandate opportunity reach large cohort youth early within primary specialty pediatric care , SBIRT routinely deliver used way optimize outcome . The National Institute Drug Abuse , National Institute Alcoholism Alcohol Abuse , Substance Use Mental Health Services Administration Hilton Foundation include adolescent SBIRT research , train service project portfolio . Lacking validated measure use ass impact guide early action , opportunity glean effective strategy component brief intervention hamper despite considerable investment . This threaten relevance sustainability work . To address needs efficient informative measurement evaluate adolescent Screening , Brief Intervention , Referral Treatment ( SBIRT ) strategy , investigator undertake longitudinal cohort study build validate substance specific measurement battery include patient-centered intermediary outcome integrate range healthcare research setting . This construct validity study investigator interested see whether brief set question accurately measure substance use compare lengthy gold standard measure . This also predictive validity study , investigator interest see whether propose patient-centered intermediary outcome relevant predict future substance use risk pattern use . The result project enable evaluation SBIRT trial clinical effort validate parsimonious set measurement tool incorporate electronic health record . This project one component two part study investigator enroll total 900 adolescent . The investigator enroll total 450 participant Adolescent/Young Adult Medical Clinic study attempt follow participant one year . Accounting attrition 6 month 12 month follow-up , investigator expect 300 participant complete entire study .</detailed_description>
