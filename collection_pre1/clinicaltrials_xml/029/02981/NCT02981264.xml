	<brief_summary>Endobronchial Ultrasound Guided Transbronchial Needle Aspiration ( EBUS -TBNA ) commonly perform diagnosis mediastinal pathology . The procedure either perform general anaesthesia moderate sedation topical anaesthesia . Most patient tolerate procedure well although cough often report distress symptom . Topical lignocaine administer endobronchial ultrasound local anaesthesia . There limited literature efficacy transtracheal/transcricoid injection versus spray go method lignocaine delivery airways EBUS-TBNA . This study would help determine procedure comfort patient use transtracheal/transcricoid method v spray go method .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Transcricoid Injection vs. Spray You go Method Local Anaesthesia During EBUS-TBNA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For patient meet inclusion criterion , demographic profile include age , sex , weight , smoke history shall record . A write informed consent obtain participant . The patient undergo EBUS-TBNA moderate sedation would randomise one one ratio either transcricoid injection spray go lignocaine group . Prior EBUS-TBNA , Blood pressure , pulse rate , respiratory rate pulse oximetry saturation record baseline Patients group shall prepare similar fashion except use transcricoid injection one group . During procedure , 2 ml aliquot 1 % lignocaine solution deliver bronchoscope use spray-as-you go technique . Patients transcricoid group shall initially receive 5 ml 2 % lignocaine solution additional aliquot 1 % lignocaine use spray go method . The total lignocaine dose procedure record . The patient would monitor adverse effect throughout procedure . The bronchoscopist procedure provide VAS chart mark severity cough overall procedure satisfaction . An audio recorder shall use record cough count entire procedure . Post procedure , patient record pain experience undergoing procedure VAS scale .</detailed_description>
