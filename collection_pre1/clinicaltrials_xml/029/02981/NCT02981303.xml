	<brief_summary>Objective : To determine Overall Response Rate ( ORR ) Imprime PGG + pembrolizumab subject advance melanoma metastatic TNBC Safety : To characterize safety Imprime PGG + pembrolizumab give combination Hypothesis : Restore ( melanoma ) enhance ( TNBC ) sensitivity checkpoint inhibitor ( CPI ) appropriate effective stimulation subject 's innate adaptive immune system subject fail 1st line therapy The study incorporate Simon 's optimal 2-stage design sample size fix 12 subject Stage 1 advance melanoma Triple Negative Breast Cancer ( TNBC ) subject . The safety criterion ≤ 4 ( ≤ 33 % ) subject Grade 3/4 adverse event Cycle 1 within either tumor type must meet order proceed Stage 2 . The start dose 4 mg/kg Imprime PGG . In event total &gt; 4 ( &gt; 33 % ) subject Grade 3/4 adverse event Cycle 1 , dose Imprime PGG reduce 2 mg/kg , Stage 1 repeat dose 2 mg/kg additional cohort n=12 subject . For dose meet safety criterion Stage 1 , least 1 response melanoma subject 2 response TNBC subject amongst 12 subject within tumor type must observe order proceed Stage 2 . Stage 2 enroll additional 17 subject melanoma , 30 subject TNBC . For dose meet Stage 1 safety criterion , success declare least 4 amongst total 29 subject melanoma , 13 amongst total 42 subject TNBC achieve objective response .</brief_summary>
