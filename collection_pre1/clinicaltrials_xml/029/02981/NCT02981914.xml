	<brief_summary>This pilot study design investigate safety pembrolizumab treatment disease relapse follow allogeneic stem cell transplant ( alloSCT ) . Pembrolizumab administer fix dose 200 mg IV every 3 week . Approximately 12-26 patient relapse MDS , AML , mature B cell ( B-NHL , cHL ) malignancy relapse follow alloSCT enrol trial . Pembrolizumab treatment administer 24 month , provide neither disease progression , development dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) , occur . Adverse event monitor every three week throughout trial grade severity accord guideline outline NCI Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version 4.0 . This trial conduct accordance Good Clinical Practices .</brief_summary>
