	<brief_summary>Spinal Cord Injury ( SCI ) devastate condition lead permanent functional neurological deficit injure individual . The limited ability Central Nervous System ( CNS ) spontaneously regenerate impairs axonal regeneration functional recovery spinal cord . The leading cause motor-vehicle crash , sports-associated accident , fall , violence-related injury . Unfortunately , still effective clinical treatment SCI . In recent year , tissue engineering regenerative medicine base approach propose alternative SCI repair/regeneration . Mesnchymal stem cell ( MSC ) use SCI show promising result several study . Our aim ass compare safety effectiveness autologous BM-MSC v autologous AT-MSC patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Effectiveness BM-MSC v AT-MSC Treatment SCI Patients .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study conduct Cell Therapy Center ( CTC ) Jordan , 14 SCI patient meet inclusion criterion recruit blindly divide 2 group equal number . The first group treat autologous BM-MSC , second group treat autologous AT-MSC . The outcomes improvement assess use American Spinal Injury Association ( ASIA ) Impairment Scale ( AIS ) . Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) perform base line 12 month stem cell transplantation .</detailed_description>
