	<brief_summary>Optiflow use prolong apnoea period anaesthesia without fall blood oxygen saturation . This study design ass whether Optiflow system efficiently replace conventional anaesthetic mask circuit preoxygenation could use emergency anaesthesia . If , would place case difficult fail intubation maintain oxygenation ie : could preoxygenate maintain oxygenation seamlessly .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optiflow Preoxygenation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Optiflow device use deliver high flow humidify oxygen/air via nasal cannulae patient respiratory problem . More recently use patient surgery larynx intentionally paralysed anaesthesia surgeon want tubes airway . This make access surgery easier/possible . Perhaps surprisingly , patient leave apnoeic 30 minute without fall blood oxygen level . The lung oxygenate despite breathing/ventilation . We propose apply Optiflow start emergency anaesthetic may beneficial anaesthetist find tracheal intubation impossible - `` fail intubation '' scenario . Optiflow might maintain oxygenation attempt intubation skilled anaesthetist arrive . Another alternative technique presently common use patient breathe 100 % oxygen via facemask conventional anaesthetic circuit 3 minute anaesthesia start ( preoxygenation ) . This fill functional residual capacity lungs 90 % oxygen give oxygen reserve breathe stop anaesthetist breathes intubate trachea . This result maintenance normal blood oxygen saturation several minute longer would case lung expose air anaesthesia . The research question ask whether use Optiflow instead conventional mask/circuit preoxygenate patient similar extent quickly use facemask , emergency surgery , Optiflow could use preoxygenate already place case fail intubation . This would enable Optiflow used purpose seamlessly without need switch two method oxygenation . Research date yet identify long Optiflow need place anaesthesia able produce adequate preoxygenation lung patient stop breathe . The 3 minute time preoxygenation important emergency case e.g . emergency caesarean section do every minute baby deliver matter . If possible preoxygenate patient 's lung within 3 minute use Optiflow would suggest inappropriate replace conventional mask pre-oxygenation value emergency anaesthesia might reduce ( although may still potential less urgent anaesthesia could apply long duration anaesthesia ) . This pilot study 20 healthy volunteer student subject undergo / sequential analysis Optiflow pre-oxygenation . They recruit poster invite consider enrol project . They receive subject information sheet provide write informed consent . On study day individual subject lie supine trolley Optiflow device fit ready administer humidify 100 % oxygen 45 l/min via device 's nasal cannulae . The subject ask breathe normally close mouth device switch . The initial test period 3 minute end time device turn subject hold breath inspiration subject exhale breathe normally via mouthpiece side sample port connect standard gas monitor ( use anaesthesia ) measure display expire oxygen percentage . This known equate well alveolar oxygen fraction healthy subject target value 85 % . After initial test subject ask walk around breathe room air least 15 minute return lung gas pre test normality . The process repeat different duration : If target 85 % reach within 3 minute 2nd test would 5 minute . If 85 % target reach 2nd test would reduce 2.5 minute . The test run would continue up/down fashion minimum time require reach 85 % identify ( near 30 second ) subject do test run 10 minute long without reach target . If subject wish split test run one session would accommodate . They would also free leave study time desire . Subsequent subject initial test duration adjust average previous subject may require undergo many test ( presumes much variation within population ) less inconvenienced .</detailed_description>
