	<brief_title>T Regulatory Cells Hemodialysis Patients : Observational Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients hemodialysis ( HD ) present elevate risk cardiovascular disease , cancer infectious event may lead high morbidity mortality rate characteristic population . Many cause explain increased risk , include inflammation , turn , might secondary dialysis-specific factor , contaminated water , dialysis modality dialysis membrane use treatment . In addition chronic inflammatory , HD patient also present significant alteration immune system result chronic lymphocytic infiltration , alteration T-helper balance ( Th1/Th2 ) etc . The immune response control complex mechanism ; mediate interaction antigen-presenting cell ( APC ) , CD4+ T helper ( Th ) T cell CD4+ CD25+ regulatory ( Treg ) , cell subpopulation T CD4+ express IL-2 receptor ( CD25 ) forkhead factor ( foxp 3 ) . Treg cell contribute maintenance peripheral tolerance suppress immune response self-normal tumor antigen . Treg cell control population 's expansion peripheral cell suppress proliferation Th activate cell . Accessory molecule CTLA-4 receptor , CD28 IL-2 cytokine IL-6 , contribute activation proliferation Treg cell . The characterization flow cytometry Treg suffer lack specific surface marker . These cell generally identify basis contemporary expression molecule CD4 CD25 , specificity marker limit , give CD25 also express activated lymphocyte . Recently show expression Foxp3 gene phenomenon strictly link development regulatory activity Treg , , extent expression gene Real Time PCR currently consider specific Treg marker . There poor data Treg cell function HD . A recent study show patient chronic HD , number Treg low compare healthy subject . Moreover , Treg cell patient HD would present significant impairment function , assess ability inhibit lymphocyte proliferation . Those result , however , affect lack data characteristic study patient type dialysis treatment apply . In contrast , recent study group show patient hemodialysis poor biocompatible membrane great number circulate Treg compare healthy control match age sex . Given absence data , still remain investigate actual significance function Treg HD , consider Treg status might potentially affect immune response . Therefore , purpose study evaluate structure function Treg cell patient undergo HD , also consider relationship different HD modality clinical parameter .</detailed_description>
