	<detailed_description>Irreversible electroporation ( Irreversible Electroporation IRE ) ablation new minimally invasive therapy inhibit tumor growth , improve survival rate achieve remarkable result , chemotherapy traditional treatment method , time adjuvant chemotherapy ablation irreversible electroporation improve chemotherapy perforation area spread cancer cell reversibility , selectivity tumor cell , avoid normal tissue damage . The combination two aim improve quality life prolong survival time . The aim study observe survival status , recurrence death time patient pancreatic cancer treat chemotherapy combine IRE . The survival overall survival patient evaluate respectively .</detailed_description>
