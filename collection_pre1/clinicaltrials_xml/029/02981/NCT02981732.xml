	<brief_summary>For nearly 112 million patient osteoporosis China , great significance prevent treat clearly understand molecular mechanism kidney deficiency . Thus , research group demonstrate early research CLCF1 associate gene regulate JAK2/STAT3 signal pathway impact bone metabolism kidney yin deficiency postmenopausal osteoporosis ( PMOP ) . To make clear understanding direct-acting mechanism CLCF1 bone metabolism , study intend : ①observe impact low expression CLCF1 upon immunity mouse OPG/RANKL/RANK signal system use technology adenovirus associate virus . ②explore impact over-expression silence CLCF1 B lymphocytes culcuturing cell together osteoblast . ③ analyze impact treat kidney yin deficiency PMOP Liuwei Dihuang pill upon immunity OPG/RANKL/RANK system , discuss mechanism regulate bone metabolism CLCF1 OPG/RANKL/RANK system via bridge immune system bone metabolism , demonstrate hypothesis study `` molecular osteoimmunological mechanism kidney yin deficiency postmenopausal osteoporosis ( PMOP ) possibly closely related impact CLCF1 regulation OPG/RANKL/RANK signal system bone metabolism '' right .</brief_summary>
