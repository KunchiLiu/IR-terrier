	<brief_summary>Flexible bronchoscopy one widely perform procedure diagnosis various bronchopulmonary disease . Most patient tolerate procedure well although cough often report distress symptom . It likely acceptance bronchoscopy would significantly improve control cough . Use sedation bronchoscopy report improve procedure tolerance . However , awake ( sedation ) bronchoscopy routinely perform many centre include . Topical lignocaine administer bronchoscopy local anaesthesia . There limited literature efficacy transtracheal/transcricoid injection versus spray go method lignocaine delivery airways bronchoscopy . This study would help determine procedure comfort patient use transtracheal/transcricoid method v spray go method .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>For patient meet inclusion criterion , demographic profile include age , sex , weight , smoke history type procedure perform bronchoscopy shall record . A write informed consent obtain participant . The patient undergo flexible bronchoscopy would randomise one one ratio either transcricoid spray go group . Prior bronchoscopy blood pressure , pulse rate , respiratory rate pulse oximetry saturation record baseline Patients group shall prepare similar fashion except initial route lignocaine delivery . During procedure , 2 ml aliquot 1 % lignocaine solution deliver bronchoscope use spray-as-you go technique . Patients transcricoid group shall initially receive 5 ml 2 % lignocaine solution additional aliquot 1 % lignocaine use spray go method . The total lignocaine dose procedure record . The patient would monitor adverse effect throughout procedure . The bronchoscopist procedure provide 2 VAS chart mark severity cough overall procedure satisfaction . An audio recorder shall use record cough count entire procedure . Post procedure , patient record pain experience undergoing procedure VAS scale .</detailed_description>
