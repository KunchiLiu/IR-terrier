	<brief_title>A Study Abemaciclib Recurrent Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study Phase II clinical trial . Phase II clinical trial test safety effectiveness investigational drug learn whether drug work treat specific disease . `` Investigational '' mean drug study . The FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve abemaciclib treatment disease . Many brain cancer show expression protein call cyclin D1 . That mean body make much cyclin D1 , affect enzymes call CDK 4 CDK 6 . Enzymes substances body help reaction cell happen . Too much cyclin D1 trigger CDK 4 CDK 6 make cell normal . This extra cell production lead growth tumor . In laboratory study , Abemaciclib able enter brain , stop CDK 4 CDK 6 make cell , slow growth mouse Glioblastoma . In research study , investigator look see safe effect Abemaciclib participant type cancer . In surgical participant , investigator look see Abemaciclib reach brain tumor .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must able understand willing sign write informed consent document . Participants must able adhere dose visit schedule , agree record medication time accurately consistently daily diary . Participants must least 18 year old day signing inform consent . Participants must Karnofsky Performance Status ( KPS ) ≥ 60 Participants must able swallow capsule . Nature illness treatment history Participants must undergo central pathology review histologically confirm diagnosis glioblastoma variant ( 1 unstained slide 1 H &amp; E slide must submit reviewed pathologist DFCI Coordinating Center prior enrollment participant central pathology review ) . Participants eligible prior diagnosis lowgrade glioma subsequent histological diagnosis glioblastoma variant make ( e.g . secondary GBM ) . To eligible study participant ( Cohort 1 2 ) require provide genomic profiling data assay perform CLIAcertified lab demonstrate follow respect relevant biomarkers require enrollment study list . Results genomic profiling must send DFCI Coordinating Center prior enrollment participant central pathology review . Inactivation CDKN2A/B C tumor homozygous deletion ( evidence single copy loss gene define array CGH log2 ratio &lt; 0.3 array CGH ; sequence data sufficient coverage evaluation ) . AND Validation wildtype RB status ( deletion/losses single copy copy number sequence data ; and/or inactivate mutation sequence ) . Participants must first relapse GBM . Relapse define progression follow initial therapy ( i.e . radiation+/ chemo use initial therapy ) . The intent therefore patient 1 prior therapy ( initial treatment ) . If patient surgical resection relapse disease anticancer therapy institute 12 week , patient undergoes another surgical resection , consider constitute 1 relapse . Participants must show unequivocal evidence tumor progression MRI CT scan . For Cohort 2 subject , CT MRI within 14 day prior study registration . For Cohort 2 , corticosteroid dose must stable decrease least 5 day prior scan . If steroid add steroid dose increase date screening MRI CT scan start treatment , new baseline MRI CT require . For Cohort 1 subject , CT MRI perform ideally within 14 day prior study registration , screen MRI subset subject use evaluation response , acceptable MRI/CT perform great 14 day prior registration unavoidable . Furthermore , reason , fluctuation corticosteroid dose around MRI warrant repeat scan long documented unequivocal evidence tumor progression available . Confirmation availability sufficient tissue prior surgery correlative study require prior enrollment ; sample must send DFCI Coordinating Center within 60 day registration . Cohort 1 participant must sufficient FFPE tissue surgery . Cohort 2 participant must tissue biopsy resection recent recurrence surgery . The following amount tissue require : 25 unstained formalin fix paraffin embed ( FFPE ) section ( standard 45 micrometer thickness ) AND 1 H &amp; E stain slide ( 1 additional unstained 45 um slide stain ) AND one follow genomics/nucleic acid extraction : At least 10 ( preferably 20 ) unstained FFPE section 10 micrometer thickness OR At least 8 tissue core FFPE block ( 200 micrometer total thickness tissue block total surface area 0.5 cm2 ) OR At least 200 mg frozen tissue An interval least 12 week completion radiation therapy start study drug unless new area enhancement consistent recurrent tumor outside radiation field ( defined region outside highdose region 80 % isodose line ) unequivocal histologic confirmation tumor progression . Participants must recover grade 0 1 pretreatment baseline clinically significant toxic effect prior therapy ( include limited exception alopecia , laboratory value list per inclusion criterion , lymphopenia common therapy temozolomide ) . From project start schedule study treatment , follow time period must elapse : 4 week 5 halflives ( whichever short ) investigational agent ; 4 week cytotoxic therapy ( except 23 day temozolomide ; 6 week nitrosoureas ) ; 6 week antibody ; 4 week 5 halflives ( whichever short ) antitumor therapy . 2 day NovoTTF Participants prior therapy include interstitial brachytherapy stereotactic radiosurgery must confirmation progressive disease base upon nuclear imaging , MR spectroscopy , perfusion image histopathology . Participants undergone recent resection open biopsy stereotactic biopsy recurrent progressive tumor eligible Cohort 2 long follow condition apply : They recover effect surgery . Residual disease follow resection recurrent tumor mandate eligibility . To best assess extent residual disease postoperatively , MRI CT scan ideally perform later 96 hour follow surgery , least 28 day postoperatively , scan perform outside window consider acceptable alternative available . In either case , baseline/screening MRI must perform within 14 day prior registration . If participant take corticosteroid , dose must stable decrease least 5 day prior scan . If steroid add steroid dose increase date screening MRI CT scan start treatment , new baseline MRI CT require . Clinical lab perform within 14 day prior registration Hematology : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.5 x 109/L Platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/L Hemoglobin ≥ 8.0 g/dL Biochemistry : Total serum calcium ( correct serum albumin need ) ionized calcium within institution 's normal range .
