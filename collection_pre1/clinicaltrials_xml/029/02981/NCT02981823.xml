	<brief_title>Effect Periprosthetic Fracture Hip Function After Femoral Neck-preserving Total Hip Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>History current related study Periprosthetic fracture one challenge orthopedic surgeon likely appear hip replacement cementless prosthesis . Hip replacement collum femoris preserving ( CFP ) prosthetic stem allow preservation femoral neck preserve bone tissue much possible prosthetic revision future . However , occurrence periprosthetic fracture result failure surgery . Existing evidence show although hip replacement CFP prosthetic stem reduce complication pain , periprosthetic fracture likely occur surgery badly impact functional recovery patient . Adverse event Adverse event occur follow-up , include hip pain , prosthetic loosening , spinal cord nerve injury , soft tissue infection poor prosthetic position , record . If severe adverse event occur follow-up , detail include date occurrence , type adverse event measure take record report principal investigator institutional review board within 24 hour . Data collection , management , analysis , open access Data collection Clinical data , include demographic data , disease diagnosis , accompany disease , allergic history ( drug allergy ) adverse event , collect summarize use standardized case report form . These data process use Epidata software electronically input use double entry system . Data management After database confirmation , project manager able access database . The locked data unable alter preserved Third Hospital Hebei Medical University . Data analysis All data statistically analyze professional statistician responsible complete outcome analysis report submit project manager . An independent data monitoring committee responsible data monitoring management throughout entire trial ensure scientific accuracy , stringency , authenticity , integrity . Statistical analysis All data statistically analyze statistician use SPSS 21.0 software line intention-to-treat principle . Normally distributed measurement data express mean , standard deviation , minimum , maximum , non-normally distribute data express low quartile , median , upper quartile . Wilcoxon match paired test use comparative analysis Harris hip score image parameter determine 6 , 12 , 24 month operation . Then , multivariate logistic regression analysis use calculate regression coefficient , OR , 95 % CI Harris scale dependent variable imaging parameter significant difference . The statistical significance level Î± = 0.05 .</detailed_description>
