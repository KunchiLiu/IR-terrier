	<brief_summary>Vulvodynia syndrome unexplained vulvar pain frequently accompany physical disability , limitation daily activity ( sit walk ) , sexual dysfunction psychologic disability . Originally suggest McKay , term `` vulvodynia '' also suggest International Society Study Vulvar Disease Task Force describe vulvar pain . The incidence prevalence vulvodynia well study . Age distribution condition may range 20 60 , limit almost exclusively white woman . Obstetric gynecologic history usually unremarkable . Risk-taking sexual behavior rare , patient history sexually transmit disease . Vulvar pain usually acute onset , times associate episode vaginitis certain therapeutic procedure vulva ( cryotherapy laser therapy ) . In case , vulvodynia become chronic problem lasting month year . Vulvar pain frequently describe burn stinging , feel rawness irritation . Most patient consult several physician diagnose . Many treated multiple topical systemic medication , minimal relief . In case , inappropriate therapy may even make symptom bad . Since physical finding culture biopsy frequently negative , patient may tell problem primarily psychologic , thus invalidate pain add distress .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sphingosine-1-phosphate ( S1P ) potent anti-apoptotic sphingolipid potent pro-inflammatory action drive part activation S1P receptor subtype S1PR158 . Biologically active S1P generate phosphorylation sphingosine , catalyze two sphingosine kinase ( SphK1 , SphK2 ) . S1P level regulate dephosphorylation two phosphatase ( SGPP1 SGPP2 ) degradation one lyase ( SGPL1 ) . Once release S1P initiate signal family five cognate G protein-coupled receptor ( S1PR1-5 ) , lead various cellular responses9 . S1P signal important role inflammation cancer . S1P act via S1PR1 implicate development pain several etiology discover Salvemini coworkers subsequently extend others . FTY720 ( fingolimod/GilenyaÂ® ) first orally available agent approve FDA treatment relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis ( MS ) . The work Salvemini 's group provide mechanistic basis understand chronic pain S1P/S1PR1 axis , provide promising therapeutic target use agent like FTY720 novel treatment pain . Ongoing work Salvemini 's lab suggests increase expression S1PR1 circulate peripheral blood leukocyte ( PBLs ) may provide relevant biomarker predict severity pain induction outcomes well predict patient response anti-S1PR1 approach .</detailed_description>
