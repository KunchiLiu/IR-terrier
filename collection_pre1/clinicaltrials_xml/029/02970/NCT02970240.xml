	<brief_summary>Circumstantial evidence suggest patient diagnose myalgic encephalopathy/chronic fatigue syndrome ( ME/CFS ) perform bad day 2 2-day consecutive cardiopulmonary exercise test ( CPET ) . The aim study examine CPET distinguish ME/CFS patient healthy control .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cardiopulmonary Testing ME/CFS Improve Diagnostic Accuracy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Myalgic encephalopathy/chronic fatigue syndrome ( ME/CFS ) lead substantial reduction activity level . Cardiopulmonary exercise testing ( CPET ) quantify physical performance , functional capacity , direct measurement maximal oxygen uptake ( VO2max ) . Functional capacity ability individual perform aerobic work define VO2max , assessment functional capacity reflect ability perform activity daily live require sustain aerobic metabolism . To best knowledge robustly design study repeat CPET ME/CFS publish , demonstrate significant reduction functional capacity express VO2max anaerobic threshold . This mark functional decline second test apparently describe chronic , disable condition , might represent possible diagnostic tool ME/CFS ; hence investigator examine . In addition examine biological marker ( e.g . cytokine anti-oxidative compound ) exercise test test group distinguish . The main aim study evaluate use repeat CPET objective diagnostic marker ME/CFS . Specifically investigator want address follow question : I . Will patient ME/CFS demonstrate significant reduction VO2max compare healthy individual ? If difference demonstrate , unique patient ME/CFS classify accord strict criterion compare others longstanding fatigue ? II . What blood lactate profile , CPET ? III . Are correlation decline VO2max biological variable marker oxidative stress , immune dysregulation metabolic dysfunction ? IV . Is cardiac function impair among ME/CFS patient assess ecco-cardiography ? Three group include : ( ) ME/CFS patient ; ( ii ) patient fatigue , MF/CFS ; ( iii ) healthy control .</detailed_description>
