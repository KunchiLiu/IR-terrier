	<brief_title>Linear Growth Neurobehavioural Outcome PT Neonates ( &lt; 34 Wks ) 37 40 Wks CGA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Growth preterm infant historically define weight gain time . As weight gain nutrition extensively study relationship neurodevelopmental outcomes establish , growth parameter relationships outcome need assess . Large multicenteric study demonstrate poor postnatal weight gain negative effect neurodevelopment . However , neurodevelopmental consequence linear stunt population assess .Understanding relationship important organ growth differentiation closely link lean body mass thus linear growth weight gain fat mass alone . Moreover , weight gain linear growth always tightly link may influence nutritional non nutritional factor . Linear growth represent lean body mass protein accretion also indexes organ growth development , include brain . American Academy Pediatrics ( AAP ) recommend preterm infant grow similar fetus , guideline mostly apply weight gain . As already describe , ideal weight gain optimize neurodevelopmental outcome study extensively . However , ideal linear growth yet define . Intrauterine linear-growth velocity approximately 1 cm/wk , therefore goal neonatologists currently follow.Given increase evidence linear-growth suppression associate poorer cognitive outcome , length may important anthropometric biomarker later neurodevelopment . Research need determine optimal goal linear growth preterm infant optimize later growth neurodevelopmental outcome . Recently role neurobehaviour evaluate early 37-40 week CGA predict useful adjunct 12-18 month full neurodevelopmental assessment .Neurobehavioural assessment tool like NAPI show correlate BSID score 18 month correct gestational age preterm neonates.This tremendous implication term initiate early rehabilitation /stimulation program neonates.. There insufficient data Correlation linear growth neurological outcome preterm VLBW baby India.With majority VLBW neonates India SGA assume critical significance growth falter report continue late 24 month postnatally.The linkage linear growth falter poor neurodevelopmental outcome need detect early India population corrective strategy need institute</detailed_description>
