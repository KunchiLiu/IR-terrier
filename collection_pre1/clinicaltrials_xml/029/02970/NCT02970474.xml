	<brief_summary>Some radiation therapy treatment plan require use bolus . Boluses place directly skin overlie area treat . The radiation beam interact bolus enter body ensures correct radiation dose reach tumor . The purpose study determine whether shortcoming conventional bolus preparation overcome use 3D printer . CT scan body used create 3D model bolus . The 3D model print plastic bolus use 3D printer . Preliminary study show 3D printed bolus conform body contour well allow precise control radiation dose . In study , conventional 3D printed bolus make . The Investigators simulate treatment bolus determine bolus result optimal treatment participant . The superior bolus use participant 's treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Utilizing 3D Printing Patients Undergoing External Beam Radiation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In radiation therapy , high-energy radiation beam treat tumor damage cancer cell . Treatment plan design goal limit exposure adjacent healthy tissue . Commonly used radiation beam demonstrate `` skin-sparing effect '' mean radiation dose build beam enters skin thus maximum dose reach depth beneath skin . For many tumor , spare skin unnecessary exposure ensure cancer cell beneath skin receive maximum dose . For cancer lie skin surface , however , desirable maximum dose present skin surface . In case , bolus ( material property similar tissue ) use mimic tissue place skin . Dose build occurs within bolus , thus allow maximum dose reach skin surface . Aside treatment superficial tumor , bolus recently use modulate electron radiation therapy ( MERT ) . For MERT , bolus thickness vary dose specific depth vary different location within tissue . With technique , bolus customized patient 's specific anatomy thus radiation exposure healthy tissue minimize . Boluses typically make moldable material paraffin wax superflab . Conventional bolus preparation disadvantage ; patient require present , time intensive dependent skill fabricator . Furthermore , degree conformity patient 's skin limit , result , significant air gap bolus patient 's skin . Such air gap show create significant reduction surface dose . The goal present study improve current process bolus preparation create customized bolus 3D printing . Customized bolus design Varian eclipse software import 3D model software 3D Slicer . The 3D model convert STL ( Stereolithography ) format interpret 3D printer software . Several preliminary study report success create bolus . One study report good fit without air gap ( Kim ) 3D printed bolus . Additionally , several study model tissue dose distribution 3D printed bolus find result similar obtain conventional bolus . For current study , Investigators enroll participant require bolus part treatment plan . Both conventional 3D bolus fabricate participant . Computer simulation dose distribution use compare dosimetric parameter . Additionally , air gap bolus measure . For participant , bolus result optimize dose distribution use participant 's actual treatment . Conducting study necessitate enrol participant undergo additional CT scan simulate treatment 3D printed bolus .</detailed_description>
