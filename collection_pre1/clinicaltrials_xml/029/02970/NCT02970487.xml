	<brief_title>Precisight® Intraocular Lens Implantation Cataract Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>InfiniteVision Optics develop new IOL system , Precisight IOL . This IOL consist combination two lens : base lens place permanently capsular bag , front lens sits top base lens outside capsular bag . The major advantage system adjustability primary IOL implantation do front lens exchange . In case either postoperative refractive adjustment patient dissatisfaction visual performance , front lens easily exchange less invasive surgery , avoid total IOL explantation . The implantation Precisight IOL similar implantation traditional intraocular lens expect additional risk . For new IOLs , IOL-constants determine provided manufacturer . They calculate basis eye model clinical test . In study biometric data patient 's eye document together implant lens power postoperative stable refraction calculation optimize IOL-constants . In present study , 125 subject enrol . Patients deviation target refraction 0.5 D spherical equivalent 2-3 month follow-up visit undergo secondary intervention exchange front lens . These patient follow 1 year front lens exchange . Subjects screen pre-operative visit . Before surgery visit , subject must sign Informed Consent Form . After surgery , patient follow one year . The visit schedule 1 day , 7-14 day , 2-3 month 5-7 month 1 year surgery . Patients underwent surgery exchange front lens also follow 1 day , 7-14 day , 2-3 month 5-7 month 1 year exchange surgery . Investigator site staff document data electronic Case Report Forms ( eCRF ) . The data pseudonymized , i.e . year birth code enter eCRF . Adverse event record eCRFs . Unexpected serious adverse event report manufacturer . Data clean do one month last patient study report finish three month last patient . Subjects must withdraw study ( ) request , ( ii ) case intraoperative complication impact safety patient ( iii ) case postoperative complication continuation study impact safety patient . The study may terminate completion high relative number individual subject withdrawal due patient 's request and/or clinically relevant complication observe . The IRB inform due course accordingly . The finding study publish investigator scientific journal present scientific meeting .</detailed_description>
