	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Biomarkers Stress Youth Who Use Teens.Connect</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intensive management type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) among youth recommend American Diabetes Association require complex set self-management activity create high level perceive stress youth family . In individual expose chronic stress , chronic condition , body respond physiological hormonal response adapt . These response harmful ( e.g. , high glucose level , high HbA1c ) . Such harmful effect may ameliorate program reduce psychosocial stress . The investigator find Internet-delivered cop skill train program combine diabetes education program significantly improve HbA1c QOL youth T1D . Self-reported perceived stress mediate outcomes . There little examination , however , whether reduction self-reported perceive stress associate reduction biochemical marker stress could explain positive impact HbA1c . It critically important understand physiologic well psychosocial mechanism associate intervention order improve glycemic control youth chronic autoimmune condition . If intervention affect biomarkers stress , would important strengthen stress reduction activity embed intervention , meditation , improve metabolic control . Thus , aim pilot/feasibility study : 1 . Determine feasibility reliability collection saliva measurement three stress biomarkers awaken 30-45 minute later 3 day home 20 youth ( age 11-14 year ) . These biomarkers include cortisol assess hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis functioning ; alpha-amylase ( s-AA ) ass sympathetic-adrenal-medullary system , salivary immunoglobulin A ( s-IgA ) ass stress-related immune change . This aim allow investigator determine feasibility recruit youth provide data large trial assess percent youth agree participate adhere salivary collection protocol , use actigraphy document awaken time Medication Event Monitoring System ( MEMS ) cap monitor determine time salivary collection . Patterns variability stress biomarker level 3 day use assess intra-individual variability relationship self-reported daily stressor self-reported perceived stress . 2 . Conduct pilot study Teens.Connect , combination investigator ' previous TEENCOPE™ Managing Diabetes program 40 youth determine whether alteration stress biomarkers associate self-reported perceived stress HbA1c . 3 . Assess epigenetic component responses examine gene-environment interaction top 14 targeted candidate gene epigenome wide effect teen ' stress biomarkers influence HbA1c level time . Candidate gene measure baseline DNA methylation pattern measure baseline 6 month follow-up use Oragene saliva collection kit .</detailed_description>
