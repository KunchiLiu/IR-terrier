	<brief_title>VitalPAD : Intelligent Monitoring Communication Device Optimize Safety PICU</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Purpose Critically ill patient intensive care unit ( ICU ) need constant monitoring nurse , respiratory therapist , physician . To make decision plan therapy , clinician must observe reconcile vast array information originate device locate bedside multiple patient . Their effort hinder : information physically limited bedside ; information overload number device separate display ; lack integration interaction device ; display fail present information way easy understand ; alarm fatigue ; lack historical data clinical context support clinical decision making ; difficulty locate team member consultation provide extra pair hand This project aim integrate information multiple monitoring therapy device ( multi-parameter monitor , infusion pump , mechanical ventilator ) onto one application , VitalPAD , host mobile device ( tablet smartphone ) . The VitalPAD process information multiple bedside monitor intelligent decision-support system , provide intuitive display vital sign information , alert reminder ICU healthcare team member . Assigning priority care early detection deterioration critically ill patient represent enormous source preventable morbidity , mortality cost . Enhanced efficiency patient monitoring help reduce time detection critical condition improve priority assignment , contribute enhanced patient safety . The goal project demonstrate mobile application ( VitalPAD ) provide dynamic , meaningful , integrated information intensive care clinicians real-time . ( also see ) 2 . Hypothesis / Aims Part I - Participatory Design . The participatory design process , propose Holtzblatt , system development mixed-method approach . The aim develop prototype easy use , support decision making , improve awareness patient 's condition ICU healthcare team member , reduces mental workload . Part II - Simulation Experiment . The hypothesis simulate ICU scenario , critical care physician , nurse , respiratory therapist prioritize care critically ill patient rapidly accurately use VitalPAD without . Specifically , use VitalPAD triage 5 patient 30 second faster ( moderate effect ) perform task control display . Expected secondary outcome decrease mental workload well increase situational awareness . 3 . Justification This research represent significant opportunity enhance patient safety ICUs Canada elsewhere directly advance conceptual , theoretical clinical knowledge require optimize use information ICU . It leverage advance mobile compute provide real time support healthcare provider move reduce cognitive demand . This integrated system aim enhance performance clinician real-time , optimize therapeutic intervention , reduce adverse outcome ultimately save life . The aim provide healthcare team member one-stop solution patient monitoring need , improve way work do ICU decrease worker stress , especially nurse . 4 . Research Design Part I - Participatory design : inter-professional team nurse , physician , designer , engineer , human factor expert follow user-centered design process refine system requirement , obtain feedback rapid prototyping phase prototype development . In Part II - Simulation Experiment : prototype device evaluate simulated ICU set use triaging task . Answer accuracy time take complete task measure . Participants complete questionnaire ( NASA-TLX workload assessment PSSUQ usability evaluation ) . 5 . Statistical Analysis Part I - Participatory design : qualitative method use analyze summarize data . Specific theme identify similar theme merge . Specific obstacle usability , design preference , opportunity information integration collate summarize . In usability experiment , error rate task completion time use detail opportunity additional usability improvement . Part II - Simulation Experiment : - Analysis Response Time . Mixed linear effect model use explore effect display , triaging set , presentation order , interaction . Differences group ( increase decrease time take triage ) express use nonparametric Hodges-Lehmann estimator 95 % confidence limit . - Analysis Answer Accuracy . As secondary outcome , number correct response participant record . The two proportion compare use Fisher 's exact test . False positive false negative detection rate compare . - Analysis Workload Scores . The NASA-TLX score analyze use two approach : Friedman 's ANOVA , non-parametric version ANOVA , 6 individual sub-scores test individual effect ; analysis weight composite score use statistical test . - Analysis Usability Questionnaire . The PSSUQ result tabulate specific problematic usability issue identify . Friedman 's ANOVA use test individual effect . Feedback provide subject screen improvement user interface decision support system rule .</detailed_description>
