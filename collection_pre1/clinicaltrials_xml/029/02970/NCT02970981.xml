	<detailed_description>The investigator hypothesize PD-1 blockade combine CTLA-4 blockade use ipilimumab would favorable effect expansion activity human CD8+ T cytotoxic lymphocyte ( CTLs ) specific tumor-associated antigen ( ie , self antigens ) , would translate improved anti-cancer therapy .</detailed_description>
