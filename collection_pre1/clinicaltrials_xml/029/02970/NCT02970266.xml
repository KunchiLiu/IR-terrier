	<brief_summary>The main objective study : 1 . Improve genetic counseling establishment prevalence genetic subtypes within expanded population patient LCA take account ethnicity family . 2 . Confirm , refine modify genotype-phenotype correlation . 3 . Edit important recommendation : - The clinical paraclinical exploration new patient base genotype , especially extraocular exploration , book certain genetic subtypes - Prenatal care couple . - Directing family therapeutic protocol progress development . 4 . Individualize panel family without mutation know gene identify new gene responsible .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study characterize clinical history disease ( age start mode visual disturbance , rate mode progress disease ) , careful assessment retina function finally , search mutation responsible condition . A full ophthalmic check-up , one inclusion 24 month : 1 . - A genetic consultation take account family history establishment family tree precision geographical origin birth ascendant . 2 . - A thorough ophthalmologic examination refer medical ophthalmologist , include : 2.1 - An interrogation development visual awakening since birth possible disturbance . 2.2 - The search abnormal movement eyeball , difficulty regard different lighting . 2.3 - Visual field evaluation Survey . 2.4 - The study color vision . 2.5 - The search refractive disorder automatic refractometer . 2.6 - Measurement Visual acuity near distance . 2.7 - Examination eyeball whole , examination anterior chamber eye slit lamp . 2.8 - Taking picture fundus eye pupillary dilation . 2.9 - An autofluorescence search use Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscopy ( SLO ) . 2.10 - Optical Coherence Tomography ( OCT ) use assess thickness retinal layer . 2.11 - Electrophysiological examination , Electroretinogram ( ERG ) allow record functional value retina . These two latter examination last average 10 minute dilation pupil . 3 . - A blood sample 10 milliliter carry genetic study identify gene responsible condition genetic counseling refine take account result study . Intermediate visit M12 : patient young 6 year age inclusion .</detailed_description>
