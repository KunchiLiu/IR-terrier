	<brief_summary>Heart attack stroke common cause death worldwide . These event occur part , due increase activity platelet , cause clotting ( thrombosis ) within heart brain blood vessel . Anti-platelet therapy ( e.g . aspirin ) reduce likelihood platelet thrombosis therefore protect heart attack stroke . However serious bleed gut brain occur number individual prescribe aspirin . Currently , reliable method assess relative risk thrombosis versus bleed individual patient prior aspirin therapy . We recently discover individual particular genetic make-up , genetic variant two gene call PPARGC1β CNTN4 , demonstrate active ( sticky ) platelet . We find individual suffer great number cardiovascular event . Interestingly , low dose aspirin suppress excessive platelet stickiness protect heart attack stroke patient . In project , aim confirm extend finding . We hope test PPARGC1β CNTN4 genetic variant allow u identify patient benefit low dose aspirin therapy - i.e . receive protection heart attack stroke , suffer bleed complication .</brief_summary>

Previous MI , stroke , transient ischaemic attack ( TIA ) know CAD . Subjects significant disease disorder ( include concurrent malignancy ) , opinion investigator , may either put subject risk participation study , may influence result study .

Patients know intolerance aspirin . Patients contraindication aspirin detail : Hypersensitivity salicylic acid compound prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor ( e.g . certain asthma patient may suffer attack faint certain patient may suffer bronchospasm , rhinitis urticaria ) excipients .
