	<brief_summary>More people Canada around world severely ( morbidly ) obese , associate high risk poor blood sugar control ( insulin resistance , IR ) diabetes . Weight loss often hard achieve morbidly obese patient . Bariatric surgery effective treatment , risk available patient . Therefore , alternative treatment need . The gut bacteria ( intestinal microbiome ) might play role development obesity IR . Several study animal show transfer stool lean mouse human obese animal could lead weight loss improve IR . One human study confirm . The investigator therefore examine , whether transfer stool healthy lean people morbidly obese patient IR improve blood sugar control , weight , obesity related parameter . This do randomized control trial . Effects mental health bacterial mouth relate gum disease also assess . If successful , fecal transfer could new alternative treatment approach morbidly obese patient IR access want undergo bariatric surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The coupled disorder morbid obesity type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) major grow public health problem Canada . The Public Health Agency Canada 2011 report , Obesity Canada , show 5.1 % 2.7 % Canadians obesity class II ( body mass index ( BMI ) 35.0-39.9 ) III ( BMI &gt; 40 kg/m2 ) , respectively . Morbid obesity associate T2D ( 42 % morbidly obese patient ) , also cardiovascular complication , non-alcoholic fatty liver disease sleep apnea , prevalence psychiatric disorder , particularly depression anxiety , high population . As morbid obesity difficult treat , drastic measure require , bariatric surgery often viable treatment option . Bariatric surgery nowadays frequently perform procedure ( 400 surgeries/year University Health Network ( UHN ) ) , different technique , include gastric banding , sleeve gastrectomy , Roux-en-Y gastric bypass . Of procedure , Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery become gold standard , highly effective induce long-term weight loss improve even resolve obesity associate comorbidities . However , bariatric surgery invasive , costly , risk complication , require life-long commitment restrict diet . Therefore , significant proportion patient morbid obesity willing undergo procedure , small proportion exclude procedure due physical mental health problems.In addition , depend health care system , bariatric surgery might available large proportion patient . Regarding grow rate obesity morbid obesity world-wide , less expensive less invasive alternative bariatric surgery urgently need . Even though obesity largely result imbalance energy intake energy expenditure , show several factor , include genetic background render individual susceptible obesity . Most recently , role intestinal microbiome investigation . It show obese people intestinal microbiome metagenome significantly different lean control , even true identical twin discordant obesity . In addition , patient T2D different intestinal microbiome control . Work do rodent show fecal microbiota transplant ( FMT ) lean obese animal ( vice versa ) affect fat mass parameter metabolic syndrome . It thus possible FMT may benefit human obesity relate metabolic abnormality . FMT become standard therapy patient refractory Clostridium difficile colitis may become treatment option gastrointestinal disorder . Only one human study ( n=9 ) investigate FMT lean subject obese patient ( ~BMI 35 kg/m2 ) metabolic syndrome show improvement insulin sensitivity . Taken altogether , excite result lead u hypothesize FMT healthy lean donor could effectively induce metabolic improvement ( i.e . insulin resistance ( IR ) ) weight loss ) distinct microbe-specific mediated mechanism . The investigator examine single-center , double-blind , randomize control parallel-group trial ( RCT ) . Furthermore , emerge evidence show intestinal microbiome , gut-brain axis , influence mood disorder . First animal study suggest FMT transfer depression anxiety therefore , FMT healthy individual may provide benefit . Therefore , investigator also assess , whether FMT influence depression anxiety , highly prevalent obese patient . Finally , Canadian Institutes Health Research ( CIHR ) Team Grant , support RCT , also study potential relationship obesity , T2D oral microbiome ( OM ) . Considering microbes present saliva swallow significant numbers—about 10^12 oral bacteria per day—and may influence composition intestinal microbiome , investigator also explore potential relationship oral intestinal microbiome association obesity T2D . Having FMT protocol give u unique opportunity assess potential relationship determine FMT may change OM improve obesity metabolic parameter . This previously study animal human . The aim RCT ass whether FMT healthy lean individual morbidly obese patient IR decline bariatric surgery , lead 1 ) improvement metabolic parameter : IR , BMI , obesity related parameter ; 2 ) improvement mood disorder : depression anxiety score ; 3 ) change intestinal microbiome metabolome . 4 ) In addition , assess OM FMT protocol combine result result protocols similar patient population go bariatric surgery , investigator explore relationship oral/intestinal microbiome obesity/metabolic parameter . 5 ) Furthermore , plan CIHR Team Grant , investigator use FMT lean donor transfer obese mouse ass effect FMT mechanism relate glucose metabolism . These additional experiment part protocol mention briefly , stool sample data patient donor participate FMT trial use study CIHR Team Grant . Significance . The number obese patient grow world-wide . The investigator examine a'medical bypass ' solution treat 40-50 % obese patient meet criterion set National Institutes Health ( NIH ) bariatric surgery ( 12 , 36 ) decline ( 13 ) , much large population obese patient ( BMI 30-40 kg/m2 ) may consider surgical treatment .</detailed_description>
