	<brief_summary>This project evaluate neurotoxic effect oxaliplatin . Oxaliplatin consider neurotoxic chemotherapy , origin peripheral neuropathy . These neuropathy remain problem oncology currently prevention strategy prove effective duloxetine seem therapeutic benefit improving symptom . In case oxaliplatin , neuropathy force oncologist reduce dose stop chemotherapy , potentially degrade oncological prognosis . Objective study ass , large number patient ( n &gt; 500 ) complete adjuvant chemotherapy ( FOLFOX ) , intensity neuropathic disorder 5 year end chemotherapy . Furthermore , study enable assessment relationship intensity neuropathy comorbidities , anxiety depression health relate quality life patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Long Term Effect Oxaliplatin Treatment Cancer Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Oxaliplatin remain reference treatment advance colorectal cancer broadly digestive cancer , incorporate FOLFOX protocol ( folinic acid , 5-Fu , Oxaliplatin ) . But oxaliplatin chemotherapy certainly neurotoxic , average 90 % patient develop acute neuropathic disorder ( within hour day infusion ) 30 % 50 % patient develop chronic neuropathy repeat cycle chemotherapy . The neuropathic grade duration symptom remain variable across study . Although symptom improve time , long-term study suggest persistent neuropathy beyond 24 month . Moreover , Vatandoust colleague suggest chemotherapy-induced neuropathy frequent severe long term ( ≥ 12 month ) previous work publish . In cancer survivor , neuropathy induce oxaliplatin deleterious impact quality life . But , study available consequence oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy patient , patient remain , 2003 , third large group cancer survivor . Only 7 study specifically evaluate neuropathic disorder induce oxaliplatin chemotherapy . Moreover , point Vatandoust colleague , real need understand long term effect chemotherapy-induced neuropathy . More specifically , two study evaluate effect neuropathy quality life comorbidities patient . Objective study ass , large number patient ( n &gt; 500 ) complete adjuvant chemotherapy ( FOLFOX ) , intensity neuropathic disorder 5 year end chemotherapy . Furthermore , study enable assessment relationship intensity neuropathy comorbidities , anxiety depression health relate quality life patient .</detailed_description>
