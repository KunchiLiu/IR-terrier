	<brief_title>Sit Less , Interact , Move More ( SLIMM ) Intervention Sedentary Behavior Chronic Kidney Disease ( CKD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There estimate 15.5 million adult stage 3 chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) 600,000 patient end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) United States . This people CKD die reach ESRD . In order decrease high mortality CKD population , `` non-renal '' issue contribute increase morbidity mortality population need address . Relevance sedentary behavior CKD : Prolonged sit time ( assessed questionnaire television view time ) associate low kidney function . Total light physical activity , measure objectively accelerometer find positively associate kidney function study community dwell adult . In analysis National Health Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) data , note participant CKD spend two-thirds awake time sedentary activity longer sedentary duration associate increased mortality . It also note another study compare CKD , maintenance hemodialysis 3.4 fold high odds sedentary independent demographic , co-morbidity , body size , serum C-Reactive Protein ( CRP ) albumin . Thus , sedentary behavior common CKD , appear worsen advanced kidney failure increase mortality risk population . Feasibility replace sedentary activity moderate/ vigorous physical activity : Moderate/ vigorous physical activity less likely effective replacement sedentary activity Americans reach even current goal achieve currently recommend level 2.5 hrs/ week moderate/ vigorous activity would account 2 % total awake time ( 112 hours/week ) . Therefore , decrease sedentary activity must involve increase activity less intensive moderate/ vigorous activity . The concept Non- Exercise Activity Thermogenesis ( NEAT ) biological relevance light intensity activity : In overfeed study , demonstrate increase ( average 336 kcal/day ) non- exercise activity thermogenesis account 10-fold difference fat storage , directly predict resistance fat gain explain variation weight gain participant . Obese person less non-exercise activity thermogenesis spend average 2 hrs/d seat position compare lean person . Objectively measured light activity inversely associate insulin resistance cardiometabolic risk factor . Daily lifestyle activity negatively associate insulin resistance . Thus , replace sedentary activity non-exercise intensity activity daily live could increase energy expenditure decrease adiposity . Determining kind light activity would beneficial replace sedentary activity : As standing ( ~ 1.5 Metabolic Equivalents Task ( METs ) ) definition non-sedentary ( i.e . sit lie ) , one might consider replace sit duration stand duration order decrease sedentary behavior . However , replace sit duration casual walking ( 2 2.9 METs ) duration might even beneficial . This notion support follow theoretical calculation energy expenditure . Assuming 16 hrs/day awake time , calculated weekly energy expenditure person weigh 80 kg trade-off 1 5 min/hr sedentary activity 1.2 METs 1.5 METs ( stand intensity activity ) 2.5 METs ( casual walking intensity activity ) . Additional kcal/week calculate difference energy expenditure sedentary activity 1.5 2.5 METs activity use equation Kcal/ week = ( METs/hr ) x weight kg X weekly duration physical activity . Trade-off 1-5 min/hr sedentary duration stand intensity activity duration expect result additional weekly expenditure 50-250 Kcal . On hand , similar trade sedentary duration casual walking intensity activity duration expect result ~ 200 1000 Kcal/ week additional energy expenditure . This consistent prior observation increase non-exercise activity could lead additional 350 Kcal/d energy expenditure obese individual . Indeed , NHANES analyse , note trade-off sedentary duration light intensity ( 2.0 2.9 METs ) activity light intensity ( 1.5 1.9 METs ) duration associate significantly low risk mortality . Thus , replace sedentary duration casual walking duration could increase energy expenditure decrease mortality CKD .</detailed_description>
