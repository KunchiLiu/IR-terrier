	<detailed_description>The trial phase 2 , parallel group design patient ER positive metastatic breast cancer . This study multicentre study conduct 18 month period . Patients take either third generation AI , tamoxifen fulvestrant document evidence progressive disease achieve best response stable disease ( least 6 month ) objective response CR PR current treatment indicating development secondary resistance current therapy enter study undergone screening period continue receive treatment addition SFX-01 . At least 60 patient enrol one three arm 1:1:1 ratio , i.e . 20 patient per arm . Enrolment base current treatment . Treatment Arm A : All patient continue receive AI , start study ( D1 ) , patient additionally take SFX-01 . Treatment Arm B : All patient continue receive tamoxifen , start study ( D1 ) , patient additionally take SFX-01 Treatment Arm C : All patient continue receive fulvestrant 500 mg IM 28 day Cycles , start study ( D1 ) , patient additionally take SFX-01 . Patient participation include Screening Phase , Treatment Phase , Follow-up Phase 28 week post D1 dosing . The Screening Phase 28 day prior enrolment . The Treatment Phase extend enrolment patient discontinue study treatment . The Follow-up Phase maximum 24 week extend time study entry patient experience event PD ( progressive disease ) relapse ( patient achieves CR PR ) , initiation alternate antineoplastic therapy , decision patient completely withdraw study refusal take part study related procedure follow-up , death . Patients withdraw study due adverse event , reason willing continue study follow-up procedure follow per protocol PD . All patient progress prior week 24 must undergo EOT visit per schedule assessment</detailed_description>
