	<brief_summary>This nonrandomized , open-label , single group assignment , safety , tolerability pharmacokinetic ( PK ) study determine MTD optimal dose regimen Oraxol combination ramucirumab .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ph1b Study Oraxol Comb . w. Ramucirumab Patients w. Gastric , Gastro-esophageal , Esophageal Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This sequential-group , dose escalation trial determine maximum tolerate dose oral Oraxol combination intravenous ramucirumab . After screen period 28 day subject enrol treatment phase study . Each cycle therapy last 4 week . Subjects may continue study experience disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Three six subject enrol dose level . Once tolerability dose level determine , additional 3-6 subject may enrol high dose level , determine maximum tolerate dose . Safety monitor record adverse event , serious adverse event , monitor laboratory test include hematology , blood chemistry , urinalysis , physical examination electrocardiograms . Subjects undergo radiographic assessment tumor response specify time point . Blood sample also obtain first cycle therapy multiple time point determination amount paclitaxel metabolites HM30181 circulation . After treatment period , follow-up period subject family may contact every three month follow-up .</detailed_description>
