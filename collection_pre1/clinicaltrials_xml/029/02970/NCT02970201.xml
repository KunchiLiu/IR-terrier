Previous study show electronic message significantly improve attendance rate primary care setting , message validate chronic dialysis population . An electronic intervention develop Epharmix , WUSTL IDEA Labs ( ideas.wustl.edu ) team , capacity use automate SMS text message and/or phone call notify patient prior upcoming appointment , well alert designate patient advocate . Patients receive message provide key contact information dialysis reschedule phone line , transportation resource , social work service , etc . They may also receive instruction experience physical symptom need educational fact dialysis . In particular , intervention design demonstrate patient center care concerned health wellbeing . This intervention may potentially improve patient adherence schedule session , increase patient satisfaction treatment , prevent medical complication associate missed dialysis appointment . This study aim determine whether electronic intervention , send SMS text message phone call key dialysis treatment information , able improve dialysis treatment session attendance among dialysis patient history poor attendance . We secondarily aim identify factor may barriers dialysis treatment session attendance emergency department hospital utilization associate missed dialysis treatment . Patients prospectively identify , recruit , randomize two group . Group A receive electronic intervention prior appointment ; Group B receive electronic intervention . After 8 week , crossover occur group study continue additional 8 week . Participants ' clinic record review determine number miss attended appointment , well record ED visit hospital admission .

Previous study show electronic message significantly improve attendance rate primary care setting , validate chronic dialysis population . An electronic intervention develop Epharmix , WUSTL IDEA Labs ( ideas.wustl.edu ) team , capacity use SMS text message phone call recording notify patient prior upcoming appointment time , option also alert designate patient advocate .

This intervention may potentially improve patient adherence schedule session , increase patient satisfaction treatment prevent medical complication associate miss dialysis . This study aim determine whether electronic intervention , send SMS text message phone call key dialysis treatment information , able improve dialysis session attendance among patient history poor attendance . Our secondary aim identify factor may barriers dialysis appointment attendance associate emergency department ( ED ) hospital utilization . Procedures : Dialysis patient Chromalloy American Kidney Center ( CAKC ) Barnes Jewish Hospital ( BJH ) Washington University Dialysis Center ( WUDC ) include study . Two cohort prospectively identify , one group consist individual history occasional non-attendance treatment session , define 2-3 missed session 24 consecutive session past 8 week ; group consist individual frequently non-adherent ( 4-6 miss session past 24 consecutive session ) . Patients cohort recruit randomize either experimental control group . Group A receive electronic intervention feature automate SMS text message and/or phone call prior appointment ; Group B receive electronic intervention . After 8 week , crossover occur group study continue additional 8 week . At time enrollment , subject ask complete questionnaire determine demographic characteristic study population interest identify possible socio-economic factor contribute non-adherence prescribe 3 time weekly dialysis schedule . The participant ' clinic record review determine number miss attended appointment , well record ED visit hospital admission BJH . Subjects ask complete post-questionnaire rate satisfaction current schedule dialysis satisfaction electronic intervention .</detailed_description>
