	<brief_title>A Phase I Trial Novel Synthetic Polymer Nerve Conduit 'Polynerve ' Participants With Sensory Digital Nerve Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peripheral nerve injury common occurrence , approximately 9000 case United Kingdom ( UK ) occur year . Most predominantly young work population . Where surgical reconstruction require repair peripheral nerve injury , technique employ change little last 50-60 year many factor influence outcome , age patient , timing , level extent injury , method repair surgeon 's skill . Despite advance microsurgical nerve repair technique , functional recovery often poor e.g . result impaired hand sensation , reduce motor function frequent pain cold intolerance . This profound permanent impact patient 's recovery subsequent quality life . Nerve repair significant health , social cost implication treatment rehabilitation employ person , estimate EUR 51,238 . Peripheral nerve injury usually present nerve stump approximate surgical repair : direct , end-to-end suture repair epineurium ( neurorrhaphy ) . Excessive tension suture line lead poor result ; therefore nerve stump approximate without tension , alternative surgical method require . Where nerve gap exceed 5 mm , two fundamental option , either 'nerve graft ' 'tubulisation ' use bridge material . This trial examine first-in-man use new nerve conduit device 'Polynerve ' repair small nerve gap digital sensory nerve hand . Polynerve degradable co-polymer Poly Îµ-caprolactone ( PCL ) Poly ( L-lactic acid ) ( PLA ) shape cylinder novel internal lumen consist specific micro-grooved architecture .</detailed_description>
