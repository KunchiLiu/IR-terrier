	<brief_title>3D-printed Module-assisted Minimally Invasive Lumbar Pedicle Screw Placement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>History current related study Pedicle screw fixation widely use spinal surgery , spinal fracture , lumbar spondylolisthesis , scoliosis , lumbar spinal stenosis . However , difficulty pedicle screw placement unavoidable anatomical variation spinal structure spinal degeneration . Consequently , precise localization screw placement essential . If , error screw placement result reduce strength even failure internal fixation , may lead series injury , include nerve root injury , dural sac tear , vascular injury even spinal cord injury . To conclude , urgent improve accuracy screw placement reduce complication screw placement pedicle screw fixation . With rapid adoption digital medicine 3D printing technology orthopedic practice , 3D technique , base preoperative high-resolution CT scan data , theoretically restore three-dimensional structure bone . That say , investigator present detailed description complex anatomical structure bone , accurately make preoperative plan intraoperative simulation . Numerous evidence achieve digital three-dimensional reconstruction 3D technique assist posterior pedicle screw fixation treatment spine lesion . Adverse event Postoperative adverse event record report Affiliated Hospital Putian Hospital within 24 hour . Proper therapeutic measure could perform follow adverse event occur , include incision infection , back muscle pain , dural sac tear , vascular injury , nerve root injury , spinal cord injury , screw fall loosening . Data collection , management , analysis , open access Baseline data collect day participant enrol study . Other data collect preoperatively , intraoperatively , postoperatively follow-up . All data input use Epidata save electronically . All data regard clinical study preserve Affiliated Hospital Putian University , China . All data statistically analyze professional statistician responsible complete outcome analysis report submit project manager responsible complete research report . An independent data monitoring committee responsible data monitoring management throughout entire trial . Statistical analysis All data statistically analyze statistician use SPSS 19.0 software ( IBM Corporation , Armonk , NY , USA ) accordance intention-to-treat principle . Normally distributed measurement data express mean , standard deviation , minimum , maximum ; non-normally distribute data express low quartile , median , upper quartile .</detailed_description>
