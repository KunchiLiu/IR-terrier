	<brief_summary>Cancer-related cognitive Impairment , ( CRCI ) commonly refer `` chemo brain '' `` brain fog '' —impact severely Quality Life ( QoL ) cancer survivor , It still remain underdiagnosed challenge treat . One treatment option use psychostimulants Methylphenidate ( MP ) , well-designed clinical trial test efficacy limit . We conduct phase II study mix method design explore preliminary efficacy MP improve cognitive function Quality life breast cancer patient treatment chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy determine parameter need design phase III study . This study include two phase : Phase one : randomize placebo-controlled clinical trial , phase 2 open-label trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Methylphenidate Cancer-related Cognitive Impairment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives : The main objective study determine parameter Phase III study measure efficacy methylphenidate ( MP ) improve cognitive deficit woman Breast cancer receive chemotherapy / radiotherapy . In addition , profile drug side effect estimate . A good understanding Cancer-related cognitive impairment impact activity quality life study population target . Population : The sample consist 40 woman remission non-metastatic breast cancer , follow-up Department Radio-Oncology , CHU de Québec-Université Laval-L'Hôtel-Dieu de Québec , receive chemotherapy radiotherapy , complain cognitive impairment , without medical condition contraindication MP may interfere drug cognitive impairment status . Before study inclusion , eligibility woman validate questionnaire verification medical record . Recruitment : Recruitment make help radio-oncology team refer patient research team . As alternative recruitment method , use poster . flyer advertisement . Finally , recruitment could make clinical trial.gov website . Study design : A mixed methodology convergent design use pilot clinical trial . Procedures : The study quantitative component use questionnaires test assess cognitive function order estimate effect size use design Phase III clinical trial divide two phase . The first phase correspond double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial test effect MP cognitive function . This phase begin time T0 , MP take , end 14 day , T1 . Participants assign randomly intervention , receive 10 mg methylphenidate ( Biphentin , slow release ) 14 day control group receive placebo . The second phase open-label study explore high dosage . In phase , participant receive methylphenidate SR increase dose start 10 mg week ( 1capsule ) . After evaluation , dosage increase , possible , 20 mg per day ( 2 capsule ) . Depending response start dose MP , follow 7 day , receive : - Methylphenidate ( capsule ) , important side effect ; - Methylphenidate 10 mg ( 1 capsule ) sufficient improvement want increase dosage - Methylphenidate 20 mg ( 2 capsule ) partial improvement without important side-effects . This phase begin end first phase T1 end 14 day , T2 . Measures : The calculation effect size base Auditory consonant trigram use determine power require Phase III study . This test also use test sensitivity Fast Cognitive Evaluation tool ( FaCE ) new test develop validate team . The global change cognitive function also evaluate ( FaCE ) . Other test explore assess sensitivity measure cognitive change . Here list measure : Rotterdam Checklist Symptom , Unipedal Balance Test , Stroop test , The Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy-Cognitive Function , Multidimensional fatigue inventory , Distress Thermometer . Analysis : Descriptive statistical analysis carry . Using test T-test , χ2 ANOVA also estimate degree improvement cognitive function compare data Placebo methylphenidate group . The qualitative component explore , 1-hour individual interview 40 woman include study , experience cognitive deficit MP / placebo , T0 T1 . The analysis interview carry combine two method : intra-case analysis inter-case analysis , order properly document experience woman arrive assessment transferability result . Each component study answer main question independently . However , data also match ( triangulation ) provide global understanding issue convergence result possible .</detailed_description>
