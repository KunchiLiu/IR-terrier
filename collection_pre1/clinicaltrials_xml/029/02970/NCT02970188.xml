	<detailed_description>Overall , propose research project long-term potential influence clinical practice establish novel therapy treat multiple domain age-associated physiological dysfunction thereby reduce risk clinical disease disability .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Ability provide inform consent Baseline brachial flowmediated dilation ( FMD ) &lt; 6 % Δ ( rationale : noninvasive screening ensure exclusion subject exceptionally high baseline endothelial function . Ability perform motor cognitive test ( e.g. , rise chair , walk 2 min , climb 10 stair ) Women confirm postmenopausal ( either natural surgical ) base cessation menses &gt; 1 year . Ages &lt; 55 year ≥80 year Occupation require nightshift work abnormal hour would disrupt eat schedule Dietary habit regularly skip meal , already eat within ~10 hour window , form restrictive eating . Unable adhere 8 hour eat window length study period Participation regular vigorous aerobic/endurance exercise ( &gt; 3 vigorous bouts/week ) Not weight stable prior 3 month ( &gt; 2 kg weight change ) . Body mass index ( BMI ) &gt; 40 kg/m^2 ( rationale : vascular function measurement inaccurate severely obese subject ) Current smoke Diagnosis chronic clinical disease ( e.g. , coronary artery/peripheral artery/cerebrovascular disease , diabetes , chronic kidney disease require dialysis , neurological disorder disease may affect motor/cognitive function [ multiple sclerosis , Parkinson 's disease , polio , Alzheimer 's disease , dementia brain disease age ] ) , except hypertension hyperlipidemia . Having unstable angina , acute myocardial infarction , coronary angioplasty , aorto coronary bypass surgery define occurrence event , symptom , surgery , change medication and/or dosage within 3 month prior enrollment . Having thyroid disease control medication &lt; 3 month 's use particular medication and/or dosage ( rationale : uncontrolled thyroid disease associate alteration vascular function ) .
