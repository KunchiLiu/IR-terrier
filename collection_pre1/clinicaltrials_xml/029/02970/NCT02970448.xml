	<brief_summary>The investigator study want see shorten total treatment time brain tumor safe.The treatment participant 's brain tumor laser surgery ( Laser Interstitial Thermal Therapy ( LITT ) ) follow radiation chemotherapy . For participant , total time treatment surgery end radiation chemotherapy l 0 week long . This study ask whether safe shorten total treatment 7 week . To shorten total treatment time , investigator want see safe start radiation chemotherapy within 5 day surgery . Usually patient start radiation chemotherapy 21-28 day surgery . Shortening total time treatment may allow investigator kill cancer cell effectively .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Expedited Laser Interstitial Thermal Therapy + Chemoradiation For Newly Diagnosed High Grade Gliomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective To determine safety feasibility reduce time interval LITT start chemoradiation ≤ 5 day . The primary endpoint ( binary ) safety/feasibility define occurrence one follow within patient window observation completion LITT end radiation : - Wound dehiscence , grade 3 { CTCAE v4.0 ) - Seizures , grade 3 ( CTCAE v4.0 ) patient without prior history seizure adequate anti-seizure medication - Cerebral edema , grade 4 ( CTCAE v4.0 ) - Failure complete 60 Grays ( Gy ) radiation Secondary Objective ( ) To estimate proportion patient require adjustment radiation plan post-LITT . Secondary Endpoint : Requirement adjustment radiation plan account post-LITT tissue distortion . Study design This study 2-stage , single-institution safety feasibility trial . Patients evaluate neuro-oncology team consist neurosurgeon train LITT , radiation oncologist medical oncologist prior surgery . Evaluable patient histologic diagnosis high-grade glioma , complete LITT , candidate standard concurrent radiation ( 60 Gy ) temozolomide determine treat physician . Concurrent chemoradiation begin within 5 day LITT procedure .</detailed_description>
