	<brief_summary>Background : Inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) group disorder characterize chronic inflammation gastrointestinal tract remission relapse . The two common subtypes Crohn 's disease ( CD ) ulcerative colitis ( UC ) . In 2012 , burden-of-illness report Crohn 's Colitis Canada estimate direct medical cost IBD Canada one billion dollar , primarily fund Canadian public healthcare system . Many life style-related factor may play important role pathogenesis IBD contribute trigger disease relapse , several factor poorly understood . These factor may include sleep disturbance . Data sleep disturbance child IBD limit . Sleep deprivation show cause reactivation colitis animal study similar data lacking human especially child . Hypothesis : In child IBD , high score sleep disturbance screener positively associate IBD relapse Objective : To develop non-invasive non-costly tool screen relapse pediatric IBD patient examine association sleep disturbance disease relapse child IBD Methods : This study incorporate observational prospective design . Participants : Participants 90 child ( age 8-17 year ) care Pediatric IBD Program Children 's Hospital , Winnipeg . All participant establish diagnosis IBD . Measures : Sleep disturbance assess use sleep diary . Patients ask complete daily sleep diary week precede clinic appointment . The sleep diary provide information latency fall asleep , number awakening , duration awakening , total sleep time , sleep quality , sleep efficiency . Mucosal inflammation assess measure fecal calprotectin clinical disease activity measure Pediatric Crohn 's disease activity index ( PCDAI ) CD pediatric ulcerative colitis activity index ( PUCAI ) UC clinic visit Anxiety/Depression : As anxiety depression often comorbid disturbed sleep , level symptoms domain assess clinic visit use Child Parent Report Versions Spence Anxiety Scale Child Depression Inventory ( v. 2 ) . Procedure : Upon obtain informed consent , participant complete 7 day sleep diary recording week prior clinic appointment . During clinic visit , PCDAI PUCAI , Spence Anxiety Scales , Child Depression Inventory complete . Fecal sample collect fecal calprotectin measurement surrogate marker mucosal inflammation . Other investigation include blood sample serum hemoglobin , serum albumin , inflammatory marker . Stool sample infection screen also collect exclude possibility gastrointestinal infection top IBD.A second clinic visit schedule 3 month later whole process repeat second visit . Regression analysis perform examine association sleep disturbance disease activity , characteristic patient ' demographic Outcomes : Primary outcome : Cut-off score sleep screener associate disease relapse ( diagnosed fecal calprotectin value &gt; 100 microgram/gram stool ) child IBD Secondary outcome : 1 . Correlation sleep disturbance score clinical disease activity index ( PCDAI PUCAI ) . 2 . Identification sleep component ( sleep duration , latency , fatigue , subjective quality ) best detect disease relapse . 3.Identification whether sleep disturbance accurately predict relapse CD UC .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hypothesis : In child IBD , high score sleep disturbance screener positively associate IBD relapse Project Design Specific Objective : This single centre pediatric observational prospective study develop non-invasive non-costly tool screen relapse pediatric IBD patient examine association sleep disturbance disease relapse child IBD . The outcomes Primary outcome : Cut-off score sleep screener relation disease relapse ( diagnosed fecal calprotectin value &gt; 100 microgram/gram stool ) child IBD Secondary outcomes 1 . Correlation sleep disturbance score clinical disease activity index ( PCDAI PUCAI ) , control symptom anxiety depression 2 . Identification sleep component sleep duration sleep latency best detect disease relapse . 3 . Identification whether sleep disturbance accurately predict relapse CD UC , control symptom anxiety depression . Experimental Methods Analysis 1 Design : Observational prospective study 2 . Inclusion Criteria 2.1 . Children age 8 -17 year care Pediatric IBD Program Children 's Hospital , Winnipeg establish diagnosis IBD accord North American Society Pediatric Gastroenterology ( NASPGHAN ) 3 . Exclusion Criteria 3.1 . Children IBD know cognitive dysfunction global developmental delay 3.2 . Children IBD concurrent gastrointestinal infection 4 Measures - 4.1 . A standardized sleep diary ass sleep past week . Scores average 7-day recording period . The sleep diary provide information latency fall asleep , number awakening , duration awakening , total sleep time , sleep quality , sleep efficiency . To complement sleep diary , Children 's Report Sleep Patterns , 62-item questionnaire , assess self-reported sleep pattern , sleep hygiene , sleep disturbance child age 8-17 year . It acceptable reliability validity . - 4.2 . Disease relapse measure use fecal calprorectin ( F Cal ) PCDAI CD PUCAI UC.The quantum blue single point care test ( ALPCO ) use - 4.3 . The disease phenotype , duration , base-line characteristic , patient demographic , smoke habit , medication , initiation new medication treatment IBD course study obtain chart review use information form - 4.4 . The Spence Children 's Anxiety Scale use assess anxiety symptom ( e.g. , panic attack , social phobia , fear physical injury , generalize anxiety ) . With clinical cut-offs , scale demonstrate high internal consistency good test-retest reliability six-month period . Evidence convergent divergent validity report . As parent youth report differ , self-report parent-report version SCAS administer . - 4.5 . The Child Depression Inventory -II ( short-form ) 12-item scale depressive symptom youth age 7 17 year . It represent one widely use measure depression age group , excellent reliability , concurrent , construct , predictive validity . Both self-report parent-report collect . 5 . Study procedure : Families child age 8 -17 year , care Pediatric IBD Program Children 's Hospital , Winnipeg , establish diagnosis IBD approach via letter inform study study procedure . The letter give option patient care giver declare lack interest participation want approach participate study . Patients parents/guardians/care giver choose whether provide `` permission contact via phone '' . This occur phone number provide letter , instruct call within 1 week receive letter declare decline approach . If lack interest declare , Research Assistant call potential participant explain study procedure , obtain verbal consent participation ask participant complete sleep diary ass sleep disturbance one week prior clinic visit . During clinic visit , verbal consent confirm informed assent/consent obtain children/parents ( guardian ) complete sleep diary collect . During visit , fecal sample collect FCAL measurement surrogate marker mucosal inflammation . Other investigation include blood sample serum hemoglobin , serum albumin , inflammatory marker ( CRP ESR ) participant diarrhea , stool sample infection screen collect exclude possibility gastrointestinal infection . In addition , participant parent complete Spence Child Anxiety Scale , Child Depression Inventory ( parent child report ) , Children 's Report Sleep Patterns ( CRSP ) ( child report ) . It expect administration measure clinic take 45 minute . The Research Assistant help participant need clarification respond question . Children also clinically assessed clinical disease activity measure use PCDAI CD PUCAI UC . Each participant measure repeat second elective clinic visit 3 month later course study period ( 9 month recruitment ) . Patients normally instruct call office start develop symptom relapse diarrhoea abdominal pain . Patients ask phone complete sleep diary bring stool sample fecal calprotectin . Stool sample infection screen also collect emergency clinic visit clinical assessment disease routine blood test include blood sample measure inflammatory marker plan within week symptom relapse . Completed sleep diary collect visit . 5 . Analysis sample size To determine whether sleep disturbance associate disease relapse , logistic regression analysis conduct . Logistic regression use goal analysis predict category outcome individual patient ( relapse , relapse ) . As symptom anxiety depression often comorbid sleep disturbance , use covariates logistic regression analysis . To determine diagnostic performance sleep measure , level sleep disturbance associate disease relapse , ROC analyze use MedCalc . MedCalc reliable valid method assess diagnostic validity laboratory test . ROC curve analysis methodology use plot curve represent true positive ( TPR ) false positive rate ( FPR ) sleep different cut-off point . ROC curve use investigation determine optimal cutoff level sleep measure contrast relative adequacy measure discriminate participant relapse versus . The MedCalc program assume underlie bi-normal distribution produce non-parametric estimation area curve . Results PCDAI PUCAI reference standard test . Information pertain test , specificity , positive predictive value ( PPV , negative predictive value ( NPV obtain . Such analysis produce range sensitivity specificity value associate different cut-off point sleep variable MedCalc program choose cutoff point maximizes sensitivity specificity . Using corrected z-test , analogous pair t-test , result show whether statistically significant difference sleep predictor term overall accuracy measurement . Based exist study sleep disturbance IBD , sleep disturbance assume prevalent 80 % patient active IBD compare 40 % remission . To achieve acceptable power .80 alpha = .05 , sample 90 patient recruit . This number highly feasible recruit within propose clinic 's patient flow research participation rate exceed 80 % current past research project pediatric IBD program . Currently IBD program care 150 child IBD 130 patient &gt; 8 year old . Descriptive analysis variable perform compare disease type ( CD/UC ) disease status ( inactive ( F Cal &lt; 100 microgram/gram stool /active ( F Cal &gt; 100 microgram/gram stool ) ) . Comparisons disease subtypes active/inactive subgroup perform use two-tailed t-tests continuous variable , chi-square/Fisher exact test association categorical variable .</detailed_description>
