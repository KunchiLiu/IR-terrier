	<brief_title>Type II Pediatric Supracondylar Humerus Fracture Management Outcomes : A Prospective Multi-centre Cohort Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose : The purpose prospective multi-center observational study compare clinical , functional , radiographic parameter outcomes operatively non-operatively treated Type II supracondylar humerus fracture skeletally immature patient . The secondary aim study develop deploy effective pediatric orthopaedic elbow trauma database part Canadian Pediatric Orthopaedic Group ( CPOG ) use prospectively collect multi-center anonymized patient data functional outcome . Hypothesis : We hypothesize non-operative treatment non-inferior operative treatment . Justification : The extension-type pediatric supracondylar humerus fracture common fracture elbow skeletally immature population among common fracture require operative intervention child ( Carson 2006 , Abzug 2012 ) . Despite subject extensive study , prospective study none look specifically Gartland Type II extension-type fracture compare operative non-operative treatment protocol ( AAOS CPG 2011 ) . The current evidence treatment fracture sub-types low , clinical opinion regard treatment method strong . This lead clinical practice vs. evidence mismatch . The exist level evidence support strong clinical opinion treatment fracture pattern , give significant prevalence area require objective prospective study . A finding significant clinical effect difference would guide future treatment common entity , find clinical equipoise could allow development well design focus prospective randomize controlled trial . Research Methods : The study design multi-center , observational , cohort protocol initial focus comparison outcomes several Canadian pediatric academic center contrast ( operative non-operative ) general approach management isolate close extension-type Gartland Type II supracondylar humerus fracture . Patients treat within non-operative group treat gentle reduction orthopaedic surgery team emergency department procedural sedation . Immobilization maintenance reduction obtain either tap elbow flex ( 100-110 degree ) pronate position long-arm cast 90 degree flexion . Immobilization type position note . Patients treat surgically largely treat closed reduction percutaneous pin 2-3 laterally-based k-wires , follow long-arm immobilization . Continued care follow-up practice across treatment group , outline `` Study Visits '' . The null hypothesis non-operative treatment Type II supracondylar humerus fracture inferior close reduction percutaneous pinning . Evaluation Outcomes Variables : Demographics age , sex , handedness , mechanism injury record . Radiographic parameter measure include stratification Type IIA v IIB fracture , angular deformity displacement lateral humeral capitellar angle ( LHCA ) Baumann 's angle . These capture clinical visit , include pre- post-reduction . On lateral radiograph , LHCA measure angle anterior humeral line line perpendicular capitellar physis ( ie . line long axis capitellar ossific nucleus ) . A lateral humeral capitellar angle le 20 degree change great 10 degree time consider significant . A Baumann 's angle outside accepted norm 9-26 degree , change time great 6 degree consider significant . In addition , pre-reduction post-reduction Gordon index ( radiographic measure lateral rotation fracture site lateral radiograph ) measure , Griffet index expand upon concept use also AP radiograph ( Griffet 2004 ) . De-identified radiograph also upload techinically feasible central database , radiographic parameter re-assessed blinded third party . Clinical outcome judge base healing , return activity , range motion . Any complication encounter record . Functional outcome judge via Flynn criterion functional cosmetic outcome ( Flynn 1974 , Cheng 1995 ) . The PODCI upper extremity score ( Daltroy 1998 ) QuickDASH ( Kennedy 2011 ) also use . Primary Outcome : Change Lateral Humerocapitellar Angle ( LHCA ) Change LHCA period immobilization primary outcome measure study , measure radiograph . Maintenance fracture reduction assess change LHCA two radiograph . This angle primarily assess reduction sagittal plane thus sensitive flexion extension . The normal LHCA consider 30 degree anterior angulation . It show change less 10 degree , good elbow function still expect . Using single measurement LHCA completion treatment would fail account quality initial reduction use change LHCA control additional variability . Also , use clinical measure would require wait maximum range motion elbow regain would introduce variability associate remodel rehabilitation would accurately reflect efficacy immobilization method . Although standardized method obtain lateral radiograph employ study patient , note LHCA vary significantly humeral rotation radiograph . For reason , quality radiograph also record assess superimposition posterior supracondylar ridge . Perfect superimposition supracondylar ridge indicate true lateral distal humerus . Secondary Endpoints : Baumann 's Angle , Flynn 's Elbow Score , Conversion Operative treatment , Revision Operation , Complications Baumann 's angle form physeal line lateral condyle line perpendicular long axis humerus see anteroposterior radiograph elbow . Change angle time measure . This angle use detect varus angulation distal part humerus . A normal angle range 9° 26° . The Baumann angle show vary 6° every 10° humeral rotation anteroposterior radiograph . Thus difference 6° post-reduction final Baumann angle empirically choose represent meaningful change . This allow minor variation arm position radiographic evaluation well measurement variability . Flynn 's elbow score account elbow function cosmesis . Elbow function measure degree lose flexion and/or extension compare opposite elbow . Elbow cosmesis measure change carry angle compare opposite elbow . These rat excellent ( 0-5° ) , good ( 6-10° ) , fair ( 11-15° ) poor ( &gt; 15° ) . Overall result determine bad grade functional cosmetic rating . Patients require operative intervention fail non-operative treatment , well require revision operation , result clinical context record . Complications , objectively observed clinical team well subjectively experienced patient family likewise assess record . Statistical Analysis : It estimate base power analysis sample size calculation assess non-inferiority non-operative management minimum total 36 ( 18 patient cohort ) patient need study . This sample size base one-tailed t-test independent mean , α=0.05 , β=0.1 ( power 0.90 ) . A significant difference consider within 6 degree change LHCA ( Lateral Humeral Capitellar Angle ) operative non-operative group , difference 5 degree less elbow radiograph consider within measurement error . The measurement error expect group . Estimations mean standard deviation LHCA base recent local research ( Roberts 2014 ) . Using online institutional power sample size calculator ( Brant 2014 ) base standard two-sample inference estimation sample size power compare two mean , investigator develop table various iteration possible calculation . Erring conservative , investigator choose accept sample size 18 patient group . Baseline demographic characteristic summarize use standard summary statistic . Continuous variable express term mean standard deviation , categorical variable summarize term frequency percentage . A one-sided student 's t-test use comparison primary outcome study cohort , non-inferiority . All statistical test perform α-level 0.05 . Multi-variate regression analysis perform assess variable affect outcome . Sub-group analysis undertaken assess within group difference . Based power analysis sample size calculation , conservative project drop rate 20 % , investigator conclude minimum 23 patient per treatment group ( 18 subject divide 0.8 account project drop ) need recruit effectively prove non-inferiority . That say , give investigator plan also pursue secondary measure multi-variate analysis sub-group analysis , plan improve likelihood obtain significance aim minimum recruitment 30 patient per cohort , total minimum number patient 60 . By use multi-centre methodology , investigator hope able meet also significantly exceed minimum recruitment requirement . This serve dual purpose add variability care environments provider therefore improve generalizability result , well strengthen statistical significance particularly secondary outcome .</detailed_description>
