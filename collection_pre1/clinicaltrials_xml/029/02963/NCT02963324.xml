	<brief_title>Physiologically-based Pharmacokinetic Modeling Ivermectin Healthy Human Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ivermectin ( IVM ) broad spectrum antiparasitic drug . Recent research indicate IVM could potentially use malaria vector control . The present study assess pharmacokinetic profile IVM healthy human volunteer aim create physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model . This model use characterize enterohepatic circulation , serve basis drug-drug drug-disease-state interaction study , simulation IVM disposition different population , special regard give adolescent child . With , safety individual administration increase , mass drug administration program , e.g . oral IVM malaria vector control , simulate plan maximize share population include . Capillary blood concentration profile also determine assess amount IVM deliver mosquito malaria vector control program . Furthermore , study validate dry blood spot analytics IVM allow easier procurement pharmacokinetics ( PK ) data field .</detailed_description>
