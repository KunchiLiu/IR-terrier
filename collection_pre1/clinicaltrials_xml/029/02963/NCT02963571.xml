	<brief_title>Posterior Percutaneous Pedicle Screw Fixation Acute Thoracolumbar Vertebral Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>History current related study Thoracolumbar spinal fracture frequently see trauma biomechanical transitional junction structure . The primary treatment method use traumatic thoracolumbar spinal fracture posterior pedicle screw fixation , method disadvantage include severe trauma , extensive bleeding , long rehabilitation time , long postoperative duration intractable lumbar stiffness low back pain . These complication occur mainly wide strip injury paraspinal muscle peri-articular denervation . Percutaneous pedicle screw external fixation spine fracture reduce injury cause screw insertion paraspinal muscle , particularly treatment acute thoracolumbar vertebral compression fracture simple anterior spinal column injury . Adverse event We record possible adverse event , include wound pain , infection , back muscle pain , spinal cord/nerve injury , screw pull-out , screw loosening . If severe adverse event occur , detail include data occurrence measure take treat adverse event report principle investigator institutional review board within 24 hour . Possible bias management measure Possible bias - Diagnosis bias - Admission rate bias ( hospitalized patient preferred reduce loss follow-up increase compliance ) - No response bias ( subject respond questionnaire respond truthfully ) - Mixed bias ( sex age ) Measures take control possible bias - Formulation strict inclusion exclusion criterion - Ensuring sample independence - Discussion mixed factor may potentially influence curative effect , pathological factor , course disease , sex Statistical analysis Statistical analysis perform statistician use SPSS 19.0 software ( IBM , Amrok , USA ) , conduct follow intention-to-treat principle . Normally distributed measurement data express mean ± SD , minimum maximum . Non-normally distributed measurement data express low quartile ( q1 ) , median upper quartile ( q3 ) . The Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks test perform comparison Cobb angle surgery Cobb angle 3 year surgery , McNemar 's chi-squared test use compare incidence adverse reaction . The significance level α = 0.05 .</detailed_description>
