	<brief_summary>Smoking one world 's leading health hazard . Besides major risk factor etiology COPD lung cancer , cigarette smoke also causative agent lung diseases characterize bronchiolar interstitial inflammation . However , associate lung pathology smoke risk development lung disease , also widely recognize major risk factor associate perioperative respiratory cardiovascular complication . Apart long term effect cigarette smoke , acute effect inhalation cigarette smoke may influence course lung pathology . The inhalation smoke cause inflammation lung induce chemotaxis activation neutrophil macrophage induces oxidative stress . As acute inflammatory response smoke inhalation seem underlying mechanism chronic diseases smoker , explore field acute pulmonary change exposure cigarette smoke highly relevant . One reason acute hypoxia injury smoking might severe mismatch ventilation perfusion lung . Using multiple inert gas elimination technique ( MIGET ) , distribution ventilation-perfusion ratio lung calculate analyze data retention excretion six infused inert gas . A saline solution contain gas infuse intravenously . When pass lung gas either eliminate blood retain depend partition coefficient local V/Q ratio . The concentration gas measure mixed venous blood mixed expire gas arterial blood allow calculation retention excretion derivation V/Q distribution . MIGET experimental gold standard determine Ventilation-Perfusion ratio lung . The aim study show acute effect smoke ventilation/perfusion ratio distribution lung otherwise healthy smoker .</brief_summary>
