	<detailed_description>This study single-center , double-blinded , placebo-controlled , first-in-human , Phase 1 study evaluate safety , reactogenicity , immunogenicity two dos alum adjuvanted ZPIV administer 28 day apart . The study enroll 75 flavivirus naïve healthy male non-pregnant female , non-breastfeeding adult subject ( age 18-49 , inclusive ) 3 equal group sequentially , start Group 1 follow Group 2 Group 3 . Screening occur within 28 day first vaccination . Each group include 20 ZPIV recipient 5 placebo recipient . Two sentinel subject Group 1 enrol first receive ZPIV open-label fashion first . The next 23 subject ( 18 ZPIV , 5 placebo ) randomize Group 1 . This follow randomization 25 subject Group 2 ( JE prim ) . The remain 25 subject enroll randomize Group 3 ( YF prim ) . Each group include 20 ZPIV recipient 5 placebo recipient . Group 1 subject receive two 5.0 mcg dos ZPIV placebo administer IM Days 1 29 . Group 2 subject receive two-dose regimen IXIARO® ( Valneva ) 28 day apart ; two ZPIV placebo dos administer three month later IM 28 day apart . Group 3 subject receive one dose YF-VAX® ( Sanofi Pasteur ) follow three month later two ZPIV placebo dos administer IM 28 day apart . A subset 30 subject ( 10 subject per group ) select receive third ZPIV vaccination . The primary objective : 1 ) To evaluate safety reactogenicity two-dose homologous prime boost regimen ZPIV among flavivirus-naïve , YF-VAX® prim , IXIARO® prim subject ; 2 ) To evaluate safety reactogenicity third dose ZPIV subset 30 subject ( 10 per group ) . The secondary objective : 1 ) To evaluate quantitative humoral immune response 28 day first second ZPIV administration , 112 , 196 , 280 , 364 day first ZPIV administration three group ; 2 ) To evaluate quantitative humoral immune response 28 , 84 , 168 day third ZPIV dose subset 30 subject ( 10 per group ) .</detailed_description>
