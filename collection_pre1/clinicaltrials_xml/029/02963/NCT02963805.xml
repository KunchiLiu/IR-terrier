	<brief_title>Active City Liverpool Active Schools SportsLinx Project : Clustered Randomised Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study design Treatment arm four-arm parallel-group cluster randomise control trial ( RCT ) include high intensity physical activity ( HIPA ) intervention group , fundamental movement skill ( FMS ) intervention group , physical activity signposting ( PASS ) intervention group control group ( usual practice ) . Recruitment - Organisation level Sixteen primary school target research team May-July 2006 . The school target base size ( student enrolment &gt; 400 primary school ; &gt; 250 junior school ) , current afterschool club provision ( limited ) , school sport facility available use ( bi-weekly ) socioeconomic status school postcode classify postcode Index Multiple Deprivation deprive ( IMD &gt; 40 ) . Signed consent sought obtain head teacher sixteen school pupil recruitment , study contact , laboratory visit school time access school facility . Eight sixteen school randomly select take part use random number allocation . - Individual level All child year 5 consenting school receive verbal write overview study researcher lead study information session hold respective school . Children give 2 week express interest via return write assent form ( child ) parental/guardian consent form school teacher . Medical questionnaire distribute child agree take part study , assessed stature body mass order calculate body mass index ( BMI ; kg/m2 ) . BMI use guide target child overweight may near overweight accord BMI cut-off threshold stipulate Chinn Rona ( 2004 ) . Generally , 20-25 child high BMI within school free presence chronic disease , metabolic disorder , motor co-ordination difficulty prescribe medication include steroid inhale asthma sufferer enrol participate project . There racial gender bias selection participant . Group assignment Intervention Participating school randomly allocate computer generate procedure one four treatment reduce risk contamination effect across trial . Data collection Measurements take place three time point : baseline ( month 0 ; September mid-October 2006 ) ; end-intervention ( 9 month ; June mid-July 2007 ) ; follow-up ( 3 year ; October 2009 ) . At time point participant attend University laboratory individual assessment . At time point participant ' habitual physical activity objectively assess use accelerometer , participant ' fundamental movement skill assess respective school . Prior laboratory visit , participant instruct fast minimum 8 hour avoid strenuous exercise 24 hour . Sample size It feasible recruit eight school randomly assign two school four arm . With estimate number consent Year 5 pupil 20 per school , plan sample size around 40 participant per arm . Allowing 10 % attrition 9 month design effect 1.2 account school-level clustering ( ICC 0.01 ) , effective sample size 30 participant per arm . This sample size provide approximately 80 % power 2P=0.05 detect target difference intervention control ( 3 plan comparison ) 9-month timepoint 3 unit total FMS skill score ( base between-subjects standard deviation ( SD ) 7 unit reliability r=0.8 timeframe intervention ; ANCOVA model adjust baseline FMS score ) . With anticipated attrition 50 % 2-year follow-up timepoint , effective sample size 16 participant per arm . Group comparison timepoint therefore defined exploratory , relatively low power detect effect size ( around 50 % ) . Statistical analysis There cluster per arm account robustly hierarchical data structure use linear mixed ( multilevel ) modelling , generalise estimate equation , cluster robust standard error . Therefore , data analyse individual level , standard error inflate square root design effect . The change FMS score baseline post-intervention ( 9-months ) compare arm use regression model ( ANCOVA ) , adjust baseline FMS score sex . There 3 plan comparison comprise 3 intervention vs. usual practice . Point estimate derive together uncertainty express 90 % confidence interval . For primary outcome , purely exploratory sub-group analysis conduct use sex-by-intervention group interaction term examine potential differential intervention effect boys vs. girl . Secondary outcome analyse use general modelling approach , inferential emphasis place result . Where appropriate , principled method apply address miss data ( e.g. , multiple imputation full information maximum likelihood ) .</detailed_description>
