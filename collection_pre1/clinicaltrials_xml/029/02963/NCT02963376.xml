	<brief_summary>Stroke fifth lead cause death United States lead cause long term disability . Distinct geographic disparity stroke mortality , high rate southeast United States include Arkansas , know `` stroke belt . '' There average stroke mortality ≈20 % 40 % high rest nation . Stroke lead cause serious long-term disability . Between 2012 2030 , disability medical cost related stroke project triple , $ 71.6 billion $ 184.1 billion , majority project increase cost arise 65 79 year age . There two main form stroke , ischemic hemorrhagic . An ischemic stroke occur 85 % case cause cerebral vessel occlusion , obstruct blood flow portion brain . Currently , approve therapy acute ischemic stroke IV tissue plasminogen activator ( tPA ) , thrombolytic agent clear thrombus within blood vessel , intra-arterial catheter thrombectomy . Despite availability therapy , reach approximately 7 % ischemic stroke victim United States5 . Delay beyond effective time window therapy common reason failure . To reduce devastate impact stroke individual society , investigator continue seek way improve functional recovery limit ischemic damage stroke patient . The potential neuroprotective agent , dodecafluoropentane emulsion ( DDFPe ) recently show strong positive effect pre-clinical animal model acute ischemic stroke6-11 . Other perfluorocarbon test human potential neuroprotectants blood substitute yet none successful .</brief_summary>
