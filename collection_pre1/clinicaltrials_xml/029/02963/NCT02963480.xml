	<brief_summary>Similar poly-trauma , acute myocardial infarction , stroke , speed appropriateness therapy administer initial hour severe sepsis develop likely influence outcome . However , crux matter `` early diagnosis '' lack high sensitive specific test , contrary , instance , acute coronary syndrome , highly sensitive Troponin T measure increased value fix component diagnosis definition acute myocardial infarction . Cardiac surgery initiate systemic inflammatory response syndrome ( SIRS ) induce extrinsic intrinsic factor , associate pathogenesis postoperative complication . SIRS closely related sepsis , contrast sepsis induced infection . This strong inflammatory response induces malfunction peripheral circulation increase lactate level , pronounce fluid accumulation increase need vasopressor . The investigator want assess timing dynamic release IL-6 apart establish marker like CRP , leukocytes , PCT . Target estimate time-scope -advance `` IL-6 axis panel '' toward measurement standard inflammation parameter inflammatory response surgical trauma pre-figuration non-infectious SIRS search eligible `` cut-off '' IL-6 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Similarly early detection SIRS/Sepsis , interleukin 6 ( IL-6 ) assay bring discussion study extensively last year . IL-6 pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokine multimodal function physiology patho- physiology : As major regulator hepatic acute phase response , IL-6 induce expression C- reactive protein , fibrinogen serum amyloid-A protein among others . However , along pro-inflammatory effect IL-6 describe anti- inflammatory agent . Especially systemic inflammatory response syndrome ( SIRS ) sepsis pro-inflammatory impact IL-6 paramount interest : Via trans-signaling use soluble IL-6 receptor ( sIL-6R ) pathway adherent junction endothelial VE-cadherin disconnect cause loss barrier function . Increased endothelial permeability result trans-endothelial flow fluid interstitial oedema consecutive impairment tissue oxygenation increase blood viscosity . Recent publication suggest , regenerative anti-inflammatory activity IL-6 mediate classic signalling via membrane bound IL-6 receptor , whereas pro-inflammatory response interleukin-6 rather mediate trans-signalling use soluble IL-6 . The IL-6 , sIL-6R , soluble glycoprotein 130- buffer : Since cell body express glycoprotein ( gp ) 130 , one crucial molecules signal-transduction IL-6 , susceptible activation complex IL-6 sIL-6-Receptor . Thus , steady state condition must control mechanism , prevent IL-6/sIL-6R trans-signalling hence unbounded activation pro- inflammatory axis conterminously kind `` buffer system '' IL-6 activity . For buffer , least three different molecule take account : IL-6 , -above mentioned- sIL-6Receptor soluble form gp130 ( sgp130 ) . Under steady-state non- inflammatory condition level sIL-6R sgp130 almost 1000 fold high IL-6 , mean IL-6 secrete , form complex sIL-6R consecutively neutralize association sgp130 . The immunological impact circulate IL-6 function serum IL-6 , sIL-6R sgp130 concentration , respectively proportion protein . Kinetic IL-6 impact procalcitonin : In early ninety , use procalcitonin ( PCT ) describe Assicot et al . diagnosis , particular , bacterial sepsis . However , discrimination acute inflammatory pattern sepsis cause generalize inflammation ( e.g. , postoperative , form shock ) recommendation give use PCT distinguish severe infection acute inflammatory state actual guideline . Nevertheless , conflict reference , recent high impact meta-analysis conclude PCT differentiate effectively sepsis systemic inflammatory response syndrome ( SIRS ) non- infectious origin cut-off 1·0 2·0 ng/mL . The drawback PCT e.g . C-reactive Protein ( CRP ) relation member IL-6 axis , molecule downstream IL-6 axis therefore increase cause endotoxin instance surgical trauma delay .</detailed_description>
