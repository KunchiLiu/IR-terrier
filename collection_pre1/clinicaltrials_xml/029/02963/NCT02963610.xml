	<brief_summary>For phase I component trial classic 3 + 3 dose escalation design utilized , fix dose pembrolizumab escalate dose lenalidomide . The patient population histologically confirm advanced solid tumor malignancy . The primary endpoint phase I component protocol determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) lenalidomide combination pembrolizumab . The phase II component trial utilize two stage design , initially enrol 13 patient , follow 13 patient early stop criterion meet . The target population include patient histologically confirm diagnose non-small cell lung carcinoma , regardless histologic subtype ; complete one line standard therapy . The primary endpoint phase II component protocol determine efficacy measure progression free survival ( PFS )</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I/II Study Lenalidomide Plus Pembrolizumab Patients With Solid Tumors With Expansion Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase I The study plan enroll 3 patient initial cohort , receive dose level 1 lenalidomide ( 10 mg PO ) day 1-14 21-day cycle , pembrolizumab ( 200 mg IV ) day 1 . Patients evaluated toxicity initiation treatment . If DLTs initial 3 patient one cycle , next dosing cohort open , another 3 patient . Similarly , second cohort patient receive dose level 2 lenalidomide ( 15 mg ) one cycle without DLT , third final cohort open . When third cohort test dose level 3 lenalidomide ( 20 mg ) complete one cycle , phase I component trial complete . Standard phase I , 3 + 3 design rule utilized follow : 1 3 patient experience DLT certain dose level , 3 patient enrolled level . If 2 6 patient experience DLT certain dose level , 3 additional patient add next low level . Dose reduction continue 1 6 patient experience DLT . The high level 1 6 patient DLT declare MTD . If dose level achieves criterion trial discontinue excess toxicity . Phase II A pre-treatment ( archival ) fresh tumor sample need participation trial . PD-L1 expression level sample determine assess role chemotherapy expression level pattern biomarker . Baseline blood sample collect immunologic correlate prior treatment Day 1 Cycle 1 post treatment 2 , 4 , 24 hour . Samples also collect prior treatment Day 1 Cycle 2 , time progression . Baseline CT scan chest abdomen obtain within 30 day prior initiation cycle 1 . CT scan contrast MRI contrast brain also obtain within 30 day prior initiation cycle 1 . Time progression measure disease imaging follow every 2 cycle therapy three-day window ( + - ) . Patients continue treatment disease progression unacceptable toxicity two year therapy . Overall survival assess every 3 month long term follow</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients must histologically cytologically confirm metastatic solid tumor malignancy phase I component . The phase II component require patient histologically cytologically confirm nonsmall cell lung carcinoma regardless histology . 2 . Patients must measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension accordance RECIST criterion v. 1.1 . 3 . For participation Phase II portion , patient must complete least one line prior therapy . For participation Phase I portion , patient must complete either one two line prior therapy . 4 . Treatment protocol may begin long patient recover toxicity prior therapy discretion treat physician .

Protocol treatment delay recovery radiation discretion treat physician . 10 . A core tumor biopsy obtain progression last treatment must available study entry phase II portion study . Any available archival tissue ( phase I II ) also collect . 11 . Female subject childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy 1014 day prior registration , within 24 hour prior first dose Lenalidomide , . 12 . Female subject childbearing potential must willing use adequate method contraception course study 120 day last dose study medication . 13 . Male subject childbearing potential must agree use adequate method contraception start first dose study therapy 120 day last dose study therapy . 14 . Ten patient diagnosis NSCLC disease progression per investigator 's assessment anti PD1 PDL1 therapy allow enroll phase II part study must switch treatment per protocol . 1 . Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy within14 day prior enter study . Patients may currently receive investigational agent immunomodulatory agent ( e.g . ipilimumab ) . Patients treat prior PD1 PDL1 direct therapy ineligible phase I portion . 2 . Patients , discretion treat physician , recover adverse event due agent administer earlier . 3 . Patients active autoimmune disease require systemic treatment past 2 year ( i.e . use disease modify agent , corticosteroid immunosuppressive drug ) . Replacement therapy ( eg. , thyroxine , insulin , physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy adrenal pituitary insufficiency , etc . ) consider form systemic treatment . 4 . Patients untreated symptomatic brain metastasis . Patients treat brain metastasis allow brain imaging obtain within 30 day trial enrollment reveals stable disease .
