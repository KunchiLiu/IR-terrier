	<brief_summary>This multi-institutional , randomize , open-label phase II study pembrolizumab compare topotecan , administered patient SCLC progress relapsed first-line treatment etoposide platinum . Patients randomize 2:1 fashion receive pembrolizumab topotecan . Participants topotecan arm progress allow cross-over pembrolizumab arm .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab vs Topotecan Patients With Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients meet eligibility criterion randomize one treatment arm , receive either topotecan alone intravenously 1.25 mg/m2 day 1 5 21-day cycle pembrolizumab alone administer intravenously 200mg every 21 day . During study period , patient evaluate clinically physical exam routine blood work every 21 day . Adverse event monitor throughout trial grade severity accord guideline outline NCI Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version 4 . Pre-specified adverse event clinical interest include : 1 ) Grade ≥ 2 diarrhea , 2 ) Grade ≥ 2 colitis , 3 ) Grade ≥ 2 pneumonitis , 4 ) Grade ≥ 2 hepatitis 5 ) Grade ≥ 3 hypo- hyperthyroidism . Patients evaluate every 6 week ( 42 ± 7 day ) radiographic image ass response treatment . Investigators make treatment-based decision use RECIST 1.1 . Patients continue receive topotecan pembrolizumab every three week document disease progression , unacceptable side effect , intercurrent illness prevents administration treatment , investigator 's decision withdraw patient , patient withdraws consent , pregnancy patient , non-compliance trial treatment procedure requirement administrative reason . Patients topotecan arm progress study allow cross-over pembrolizumab arm . After end treatment , patient follow minimum 30 day adverse event monitoring . Serious adverse event collect 90 day end treatment 30 day end treatment subject initiate new anticancer therapy , whichever early . Immune relate serious adverse event follow 90 day end treatment . Subjects discontinue treatment reason disease progression posttreatment follow-up every 6 week disease status progression , initiate non-study cancer treatment , withdraw consent , become lose follow-up . All subject follow telephone contact every 3 month overall survival death withdrawal consent . Although subject enrol regardless PD-L1 status , subject require provide tissue tumor lesion ( either archive tissue new biopsy initiate therapy ) . Tumor sample require initiating therapy ( preferably new specimen ) repeat biopsy perform , clinically feasible , on-treatment ( week 4 6 ) pembrolizumab arm time disease progression topotecan arm . PD-L1 expression status immunohistochemistry determine tumor baseline , treatment time topotecan progression . Numerous correlative study also perform , outline . Peripheral blood mononuclear cell sample collect screening , day 1 cycle 1 , 2 3 , time image study ( study ) , characterization T-cell phenotype understand change may correlate clinical response .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>In order eligible participation trial , patient must : 1 . Have histologically cytologically confirm small cell lung cancer . Confirmation do participate site . 2 . Have relapse progress one prior chemotherapy regimen , must etoposideplatinum doublet . Eligible patient define follow : `` Sensitive '' Disease : Patients one previous line chemotherapy relapse &gt; 60 day completion treatment . `` Refractory '' Disease : Patients response firstline chemotherapy progression &gt; 60 day complete treatment . 3 . Be ≥ 18 year age day sign informed consent . 4 . Have life expectancy least 3 month . 5 . Have performance status ≤ 1 ECOG Performance Scale . 6 . Have measurable disease base RECIST 1.1 . 7 . Have tumor tissue specimen available either core excisional biopsy . The tumor specimen adequate size tumor cellularity perform whole exome sequence immunohistochemistry . In subject newly obtain sample obtain ( e.g . tumor inaccessible safety concern ) , archive tissue may submit , otherwise satisfies specimen criterion . Archival sample must obtain within 42 day prior sign consent ( please refer section 12.1 protocol ) . 8 . Demonstrate adequate organ function define Table 1 . Table 1 .

Note : Patients ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy ≤ Grade 2 alopecia exception criterion may qualify study . 5 . Has undergone major surgery , he/she must recover adequately toxicity and/or complication intervention prior start therapy . 6 . Has know additional malignancy progress require active treatment . 7 . Has know active central nervous system ( CNS ) metastasis . Patients previously treat brain metastasis may participate provide stable ( without evidence progression image least four week prior first dose trial treatment neurologic symptom return baseline ) , evidence new enlarge brain metastasis , use steroid least 7 day prior trial treatment . 8 . Has know carcinomatous meningitis . 9 . Has active autoimmune disease require systemic treatment past 2 year document history clinically severe autoimmune disease , syndrome require systemic steroid immunosuppressive agent .
