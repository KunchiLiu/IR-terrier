	<brief_summary>Neurogenic Orthostatic Hypotension ( NOH ) clinically define consistent drop systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) ≥30mmHg upon stand seat lying position . However , 50 % NOH patient also associate supine hypertension . It propose supine hypertension result intact post-ganglionic sympathetic nerve therefore due residual sympathetic tone . Furthermore , research investigate effect melatonin show blood pressure implication naturally secrete hormone . Specifically , melatonin investigate non-traditional anti-hypertensive agent patient essential nocturnal hypertension . Central peripheral mechanism propose help explain melatonin reduces blood pressure . Therefore , aim identify NOH patient either intact denervated post-ganglionic sympathetic nerve , monitor correlation supine hypertension subsequently investigate effect melatonin blood pressure patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Melatonin Reduce Nocturnal Hypertension Patients With Neurogenic Orthostatic Hypotension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension ( NOH ) debilitate condition associate reduce quality life , impaired function also independent predictor mortality ( Bendini et al. , 2007 ; Cordeiro et al. , 2009 ; Rose et al. , 2006 ) . NOH clinically define sustain reduction systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) ≥30mmHg within 3 minute stand head-up tilt least 60 degree tilt table ( Freeman et al. , 2011 ) . Specifically , neurogenic OH differentiate cause orthostatic hypotension , hypotension due endocrine issue , generalize low blood pressure , low blood volume , etc. , NOH associate autonomic dysfunction . Specifically , dysfunction reflexive regulation mediate sympathetic nervous system ( Goldstein Sharabi , 2009 ; Low et al. , 2008 ) . Studies implicate specific dysfunction peripheral sympathetic nerve disorder accompany NOH Multiple System Atrophy ( MSA ) , Pure Autonomic Failure ( PAF ) Parkinson Disease ( PD+NOH ) ( Imrich et al. , 2009 ; Senard et al. , 1993 ; Sharabi et al. , 2006 ) . In clinical NOH population know diagnosis MSA , PAF PD+NOH , infusion yohimbine use detect whether post-ganglionic sympathetic nerve intact denervated . Yohimbine alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist , healthy/intact sympathetic nerve , cause increase release norepinephrine ( NE ) sympathetic nerve via increase sympathetic neuronal outflow . NE natural neurotransmitter release sympathetic nervous system required increase activity . In person intact post-ganglionic sympathetic nerve infusion yohimbine result increase blood pressure , arterial NE level , heart rate level , decrease forearm blood flow indicative vasoconstriction . In contrast , patient sympathetic denervation response attenuate ( Senard et al. , 1993 ; Shannon et al. , 2000 ; Sharabi et al. , 2006 ) . However , study , clinical population consist MSA , PAF PD+NOH . Little research do NOH population without underlie diagnosis , fact , 1/3 patient NOH identifiable underlying cause ( Robertson Robertson , 1994 ) . Furthermore , hypothesized supine hypertension select patient population due residual sympathetic tone patient intact post-ganglionic sympathetic nerve . Approximately 50 % NOH patient associated supine hypertension ( Shannon et al. , 2000 ) , leave untreated , come unique set cardiovascular complication , significantly high left-ventricular mass index , specific end organ damage ( Vagaonescu et al. , 2000 ) , heart attack stroke . Therefore , clinician leave challenge dilemma find near impossible balance risk associate supine hypertension versus risk sudden hypotension upon stand associated consequence fall , fracture head injury result immediately morbid event . Medications nitrate antihypertensive prescribe , however use strongly caution quite frequent NOH patient often old nocturia , result frequently throughout night . Other option raise head bed 4 inch ground order reduce renal hyper-perfusion pose additional conservative measure , however , act treatment supine hypertension . In contrast , melatonin natural hormone secrete pineal gland response low light involve maintain proper circadian rhythm sleep pattern . However , recently , grow source literature support melatonin important role blood pressure control : ) In rat , follow pinealectomy , evidence vasoconstriction ( Cunnane et al. , 1980 ) hypertension ( Zanoboni et al. , 1978 ; Zanoboni Zanoboni-Muciaccia , 1967 ) . ii ) Experimental hypertension elicit via pinealectomy reverse exogenous administration melatonin ( Holmes Sugden , 1976 ) . iii ) Continuous light exposure , result melatonin deficiency , peripheral vasoconstriction hypertension ( Briaud et al. , 2004 ; Brown et al. , 1991 ) . Therefore , melatonin look non-traditional anti-hypertensive medication patient essential nocturnal hypertension . In study 34 patient nocturnal hypertension , administration melatonin prove slight , yet significant , reduction nighttime blood pressure measurement ( Grossman et al. , 2006 ) . In study , melatonin take 3 4 week via oral prescription 1 hour bed . The dose formulated controlled- slow-release throughout night . In study , average systolic BP drop 6.5mmHg 4mmHg diastolic supine/nighttime blood pressure . While reduction may seem significant , clinical . In study 2156 hypertensive patient , follow median follow-up period 5.6 year find cardiovascular risk adjustment per 5mmHg reduction nocturnal blood pressure patient age 55 year , 0.92 ( 95 % CI0.88-0.96 ) per 5mmHg reduction nocturnal diastolic blood pressure 0.82 ( 95 % CI0.77-0.88 ) . The decrease mean asleep BP follow-up significantly associate event-free survival ( Hermida et al. , 2010 ) . In woman , mean decrease 6mmHg diastolic pressure significantly reduce overall mortality vascular disease 21 % , fatal nonfatal stroke 42 % , fatal nonfatal coronary heart disease 14 % ( Rich-Ewards et al. , 1995 ) . Currently , pose mechanism melatonin reduce blood pressure consist central peripheral mechanism ( Capsoni et al. , 1994 ; Pogan et al. , 2002 ; Ray , 2003 ; Satake et al. , 1991 ; Stankov et al. , 1993 ; Weekley , 1993 ) . Therefore , objective current study : 1 . Identify NOH patient either peripherally intact v denervated post-ganglionic sympathetic innervation help identify group patient potentially susceptible supine hypertension . 2 . Administer melatonin monitor effect supine/nocturnal blood pressure patient supine hypertension , 3 . Investigate propose mechanism melatonin compare effect patient peripherally intact v denervated sympathetic nerve .</detailed_description>
