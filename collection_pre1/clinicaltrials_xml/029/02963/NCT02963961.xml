	<brief_summary>Postoperative delirium significant public health concern , affect 70 % elderly patient present surgery . Furthermore , postoperative delirium associate increased mortality , persistent cognitive decline , increase hospital length stay , elevate healthcare cost . Unfortunately , lack evidence-based strategy consistently effectively reduce risk delirium . In fact , although American Geriatrics Society release guideline prevention postoperative delirium , evidence support many propose preventive measure deem low quality . Cognitive training exercise show improve cognitive function functional status community-dwelling elderly adult , benefit may last several month year . Specifically , train exercise lead improved performance attention , short-term memory , visuospatial processing ; implicate clinical feature delirium . Cognitive training also strengthen connectivity brain network implicate postoperative delirium . Thus , give specific neurological benefit afford , preoperative cognitive training may provide protection development postoperative delirium . As , aim pilot study assess feasibility implement preoperative cognitive training program surgical patient high-risk delirium associate complication .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This single-center study conduct University Michigan Health System . Participants prospectively enrol randomized interventional group ( cognitive training ) control group ( train ) . Recruitment take place University Michigan Domino 's Farms preoperative clinic least seven day prior schedule , elective surgery . The recruitment goal 30 patient per group ( total N=60 ) feasibility study . A computer-generated , stratified randomization schedule utilized . This study use adaptive cognitive training battery specifically target attention , work memory , visuospatial processing ( BrainHQ , Posit Science Corporation , San Francisco , CA ) . These test successfully use across diverse patient population , demonstrate improvement cognition functional outcome vary degree . The level difficulty test automatically adjust depend participant 's performance , test difficulty increase user performance improves . Participants access training software platform via home internet connection , study team able monitor training progress . Delirium assessment perform use Confusion Assessment Method , 3-minute diagnostic assessment ( 3D-CAM ) CAM-ICU appropriate , take place baseline , postanesthesia recovery unit ( PACU ) , twice daily postoperative day ( POD ) 1-3 . The assessor perform CAM interview blind intervention . Our team complete formal training CAM methodology NIH-funded ( K07AG041835 ) Center Excellence Delirium Aging : Research , Training , Educational Enhancement ( CEDARTREE ) Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital , Boston , MA . Cognitive function briefly assess throughout study period use three test NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery - Flanker Inhibitory Control Attention Test , List Sorting Working Memory Test , Pattern Comparison Processing Speed Test . Collectively , test assess executive function , attention , work memory , process speed , cognitive domain affect delirium described . These test validate adult age 85 , administer , via calibrate iPad , participant baseline , morning surgery , conclusion POD3 visit . The purpose test ass sustain , transfer , cognitive gain afford train intervention group . Delirium grave public health concern , particularly surgical patient . Cognitive train show promise improve clinical neurophysiological trait associate delirium , though potential efficacy test preventive manner vulnerable surgical patient . Cognitive prehabilitation , via target cognitive training exercise , may serve feasible strategy reduce risk delirium associate morbidity mortality .</detailed_description>
