	<detailed_description>The propose project implement test unique Virtual Reality Cognitive Training ( VRCT ) combine concurrent cycling recumbent stationary cycle , also know exergame seamlessly integrate specific cognitive task virtual environment synchronize cycle promote cognition . Cycling interest virtual environment motivate engage old adult participate exercise , VRCT could augment cycle 's effect cognition . The purpose project demonstrate feasibility efficacy exergame intervention cognition two phase . In Phase I , prototype VRCT exergame develop , follow feasibility test use single-group mixed method design . In Phase II fully-featured version VRCT exergame develop follow RCT randomize subject 2:1:1 allocation ratio 3 parallel group ( exergame : cycling : attention control ) . Mixed method use assess outcome phase .</detailed_description>
