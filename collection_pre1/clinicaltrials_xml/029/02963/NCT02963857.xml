	<detailed_description>Breast surgery one painful post-operative surgery . This surgery well know induce postoperative chronic pain . The paravertebral block , efficacy less invasive nature epidural analgesia , quickly become reference technique pain management major breast surgery . Peripheral regional anesthesia breast surgery appear past year . Among technique PEC block , Serratus block recently pecto-intercostal fascial plane block ( PIF block ) . Currently investigator hospital every day 's practice , association serratus block PIF block make , allow complete block lateral branch intercostal nerve ( serratus block ) anterior branch intercostal nerve ( PIF block ) . Therefore , association block may lead complete analgesia breast , serratus block alone allow analgesia lateral part breast . This technique previously describe . The author evoke possibility association serratus PIF block describe technique patient , investigator knowledge evaluation efficacy procedure make . The objective study analyze technique collection form evaluate satisfaction post-operative morphine consumption woman receive association block general anesthesia unilateral mastectomy homolateral total lymphadenectomy . This purely observational study assess current practice type surgery .</detailed_description>
