	<brief_title>A Study Promoting Critical Illness Recovery Elderly -- Pilot</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients randomize intervention control group . Patients receive therapy accord group assignment hospital discharge day 28 , whichever come first . The intervention group receive in-bed cycle ergometry within 48 hour randomization safety criterion meet . In-bed cycle ergometry show safe feasible critically ill approve use population . Subjects enrol intervention arm screen least 5 day per week evaluate meet pre-defined safety criterion base study early mobilization cycle Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) . Patients position semi-recumbent position cycle per ICU guideline . The cycler provide 3 different possible mode cycling—passive , active-assisted , active . The investigator start passive cycling patient may progress active-assisted active cycling . The goal duration cycle 30 minute . Subjects receive in-bed cycling least 5 time per week duration ICU stay day 14 , whichever come first . During cycle therapy session , physical therapist also complete case report form note vital sign , level mobilization , safety measure . In addition cycling , intervention arm receive early physical therapy ( PT ) . This physical therapy perform accord protocol additional ICU hospital-administered rehabilitation strategy previously develop . Patients receive 30 minute Physical Therapy ( PT ) least 5 time per week conscious . If unconscious , subject receive passive range motion ( PROM ) 10 repetition per body part daily . Once conscious , subject progress different level PT emphasis ambulation . Physical therapy intervention arm patient continue hospitalize day 28 . Outpatient therapy provide discretion patient 's treating physician . The control group receive usual care physical therapy order treat team ICU floor hospital discharge . These subject also receive therapy outpatient order physician .</detailed_description>
