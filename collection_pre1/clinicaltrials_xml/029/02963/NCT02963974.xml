	<brief_title>Cochlear Implantation Pediatric Cases Unilateral Hearing Loss</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Unilateral hearing loss ( UHL ) term use describe substantial hearing loss one ear normal hear contralateral ear . Despite normal hear one ear , individual experience reduce speech perception noise , variable ability localization task , increase report hear handicap , reduce quality life , often , obtain limited benefit conventional amplification . In United States , prevalence UHL child range 0.03 % 3 % , depend age child . Cochlear implantation perform child bilateral , severe profound deafness significant impact several aspect child development . The practice provide cochlear implant child significant hearing loss one ear great interest occur great frequency report case study small set clinical report . The primary purpose feasibility study demonstrate effectiveness cochlear implantation child , age 3 year 6 month 6 year , 6 month , moderate profound UHL . Postoperative result evaluate speech perception measure , localization task , hear noise task , subjective report .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Unilateral moderatetoprofound sensorineural hearing loss . 1 . Unaided residual hearing threshold yield pure tone average ( PTA ) frequencies 500 Hz , 1000 Hz 2000 Hz ≥70 dB HL ear implant . It possible subject may hear frequency include average . 2 . Hearing thresholds contralateral ear ≤25 decibel ( dB ) hearing loss ( HL ) 2 . Between 3 year , 6 mo 6 year , 6 mo age implantation . 3 . Anatomically normal cochlea cochlear nerve evaluate imaging , image modality per physician 's discretion . 4 . No evidence progressive hearing loss . 5 . Willing undergo 4 week hearing aid trial warrant base achieve desired audibility fit via real ear Desired Sensation Level ( DSL ) method . See Reference Appendix B . 6 . Aided word recognition ear implant 30 % less measure Consonant Nucleus Consonant ( CNC ) word ( 50word list ) 1 . When listen appropriately fit hearing aid masking applied contralateral ear ( Turner , 2004 ) . 2 . Aided test conduct soundproof booth participant seat 1 meter sound source , face 0° azimuth . Recorded material present 60 dB SPL . 3 . The hearing aid output measure use DSL target . 7 . Realistic parental expectation : verbal acknowledgement potential benefit risk , postoperative variation performance . For instance , cochlear implantation restore normal hearing . 8 . Willing obtain recommended meningitis vaccination per Center Disease Control ( CDC ) recommendation . 9 . Development cognition within normal range measure LeiterR test nonverbal intelligence cognitive ability Bracken Basic Concept Scale Revised . 10 . Parental commitment study parameter include able willing participate evaluation schedule , involvement prescribe therapy , travel investigational site studyrelated activity . 1 . English primary language home 1 . Speech perception material present English 2 . Parental questionnaire administer English 2 . Conductive hearing loss either ear 3 . Compromised auditory nerve 4 . Ossification cochlea 5 . Inability participate followup procedure ( i.e. , unwillingness , geographic location ) 6 . History condition contraindicates middle inner ear surgery anesthesia ( i.e . otitis medium refractory treatment ) 7 . Case sudden sensorineural hearing loss first evaluate physician</criteria>
