	<brief_title>A Study Melflufen Combination With Dexamethasone Relapsed Refractory Multiple Myeloma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Melflufen design targeted delivery alkylating moiety tumor cell . In contrast alkylating agent hydrophilic , lipophilicity melflufen lead rapid extensive distribution tissue cell . Inside cell , melflufen may directly bind DNA readily metabolize intracellular peptidase well-known antitumor compound melphalan , esterases des-ethylmelflufen , also alkylating property . Due high activity peptidases esterases human tumor cell , formation melflufen 's metabolite rapid cell subsequent inflow melflufen . Since des-ethylmelflufen melphalan relatively hydrophilic , possibility intracellular trap alkylators .</detailed_description>
