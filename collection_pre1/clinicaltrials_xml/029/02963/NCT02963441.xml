	<brief_summary>Diabetes affect 29.1 million people 9.3 % population United States . Results study Eye Diseases Prevalence Research Group reveal 40 % diabetes patient degree diabetic retinopathy ( DR ) many 8 % severe , vision-threatening form DR . Early laser photocoagulation high-risk proliferative diabetic retinopathy ( PDR ) show decrease relative risk vision loss much 52 % . Injections anti-VEGF agent preserve improve vision people PDR and/or diabetic macular edema . Despite effective treatment however , tens thousand people diabetes go blind year largely n't undergo annual screening retinopathy . Currently , 50 % -60 % people diabetes yearly eye exam may enough eye specialist see balance . To address issue patient compliance diabetic retinopathy screening , IDx-DR develop automate screen device design analyze fundus image presence lesion disease feature associate diabetic retinopathy . This study design validate safety efficacy device frontlines healthcare .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Multi-center Study Evaluate Performance Automated Device Detection Diabetic Retinopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study multicenter observational study primary endpoint determine sensitivity specificity IDx-DR diabetic retinopathy primary care set . IDx-DR automate software device design analyze ocular fundus digital color photograph take frontline primary care setting order quickly screen diabetic retinopathy ( DR ) . The study involve 834 subject exclusion . Participants meet eligibility criterion recruit site staff primary care provider . After assess eligibility secure write informed consent , fundus photograph capture use commercially available , Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) clear , non-mydriatic ocular fundus camera camera operator previous professional experience ophthalmic photography . Images take accord specific IDx-DR imaging protocol provide camera operator analyze IDx-DR device . The photography protocol consist two image ocular fundus ( one optic disc center , one macula center ) , obtain eye enrol participant . After generate IDx-DR screen result , professional ophthalmic photographer perform gold standard image reference standard grade determination sensitivity specificity IDx-DR device . The CRO follow standard operating procedure monitor study accordance Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) recommendation FDA regulatory requirement . Any site meeting minimum requirement initiate trial , administrative , procedural data quality deficiency require correction order comply regulatory requirement , protocol , meet requirement sponsor CRO , notify write deficiency permit reasonable opportunity rectify deficient condition . After study initiation , inability site rectify seriously deficient condition timely manner maintain compliance regulatory requirement may cause termination study activity , closure investigational site , notification decision relevant Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) Independent Ethics Committee ( IEC ) regulatory authority appropriate . Participating sit initial monitoring visit , routine interim monitor visit ( schedule determine sponsor CRO ) study study close-out visit conduct experienced monitoring personnel . Additional monitoring visit may perform cause volume information review easily complete single visit . Study visit normally schedule well advance necessary site staff appropriate record available monitoring visit . Each monitor visit utilize standardized checklist element review site , tailor specific requirement study . Site monitor visit routinely review participate site staff roster ; study administrative financial document ; require regulatory documentation ; status IRB/IEC approval ; change action take since previous visit ; participant recruitment status , screen , enrollment , follow-up visit record ; documentation inform consent participant ; review adverse event ; investigational product storage condition ; outstanding data clarification review data element source documentation . Site visit follow standard CRO procedure report prepare study record . The CRO host manage web-based integrated clinical data system compliance FDA 's guidance Computerized Systems Used Clinical Investigations ( 2007 ) 21 CFR Part 11 . The CRO also develop implement standard web-based electronic Case Report Forms ( eCRFs ) use clinical trial site image reading center . Quality assurance select data integrity control build eCRF , CRO may apply additional data integrity check assist monitor improve data quality . The CRO obtain IDx-DR result directly computer server system isolate sponsor access study analysis complete accord SAP . The Sponsor chosen independent data storage center clinical trial . The IDx-DR software lock prior initiate clinical trial . A copy place escrow prior start enrollment audit purpose . Documentation , log audit record provide evidence IDx direct access trial data course trial . Safety evaluate time participant study include time consent time exit typically less one day . Safety assess frequency incidence ADEs UADEs . Because consider device study , consistent use follow definition assess safety issue : - Adverse device effect ( ADE ) , mean adverse event relate use investigational medical device . - Unanticipated adverse device effect ( UADE ) , mean serious adverse effect health safety life-threatening problem death cause , associate use previously identify nature , severity , degree incidence . The CRO provide safety reporting service , include review , assessment , documentation , report AEs UADEs submit clinical investigator . Investigators Sponsor notify unreported AEs UADEs observe study record monitor routine cause monitoring activity . Events consider serious unexpected site staff CRO immediately investigate CRO Sponsor determine event qualifies expedite report regulatory authority . The CRO responsible coordinating expedite report serious unexpected AEs UADEs regulatory authority within require timeframes determination reporting make . The CRO review summary information report unexpected serious AEs UADEs submit investigator , review individual event situation require .</detailed_description>
