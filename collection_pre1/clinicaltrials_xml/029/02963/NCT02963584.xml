	<detailed_description>This parallel , 2-arm , randomized trial compare intervention group receive CTO Choice ( decision aid ) control group receive usual primary care . 100 patient 60 cardiologist randomize computer . The investigator measure effect CTO Choice five outcome : ( ) patient knowledge regard CTO PCI medication ( risk benefit ) ; ( b ) quality decision make process patient clinician ; ( c ) patient clinician acceptability satisfaction decision aid ; ( ) rate percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) medication ; ( e ) trial process ( e.g. , ability recruit participant , collect patient outcome ) . To capture outcome , investigator use patient clinician survey follow visit video recording clinical encounter . These video recording also allow u determine extent clinician expose decision aid able recreate element decision aid control patient .</detailed_description>
