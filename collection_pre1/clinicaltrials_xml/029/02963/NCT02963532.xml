	<brief_summary>The timing extubation follow surgery anesthesia young child complex decision frequently guide experience clinician . The clinician frequently must make decision base assimilate multiple cue may may demonstrate patient ready extubation eye opening , conjugate gaze , spontaneous ventilation , end tidal agent concentration . At time publish data predictive ability individual extubation criterion young patient undergo anesthesia surgery practice base solely experience anecdotal teaching . In case time misjudge patient extubated early negative airway reflex breath hold laryngospasm may take create critical situation patient forgoes gas exchange rapidly desaturates potential bradycardia cardiovascular collapse . Routine criterion use determine fitness extubation primarily describe intensive care unit literature may less relevant operating room set routine general anesthetic . Most predictor include adequate tidal volume , presence conjugate gaze , eye opening , patient movement purposeful otherwise , low end tidal anesthetic agent concentration , response physical verbal stimulation laryngeal stimulation test previously evaluate determine individual predictive value decide presently anesthetize patient emerge ready extubated . In order perform laryngeal stimulation test patient must breathe spontaneously practitioner gently move endotracheal tube stimulate larynx . In patient stage 2 anesthesia , clinician typically observe cough series cough follow respiratory pause great 5 second . In situation patient adequately pass stage 2 remains increase risk apnea , breath holding , laryngospasm . If patient stage 1 anesthesia clinician observe cough follow brief pause ( le 5 second ) almost immediate return spontaneous ventilation . In conclusion , exist quantitative data predictive value various criterion extubation goal study determine indivdual predictive value different criterion determing fitness extubaion young pediatric patient record presence absence various criterion pediatric patient time extubation routine anesthetic care .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Extubation Pediatric Patients : An Observational Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives The objective study prospectively observe frequency predictive value specific sign criterion correlate successful extubation young child determine present great frequency sign predictive successful extubation . Methods Measures Design A trained observer prospectively observe emergence extubation pediatric patient age less 7 year age potent inhalational agent use anesthetic maintenance . They record presence absence certain accept sign young child ready extubation eye opening , postive larygneal stimulation test , purposeful movement , end tidal agent concentration , several others ( see Appendix 1 complete list ) . We also record use nondepolarizing neuromuscular block drug , use presence train four monitoring , end tidal carbon dioxide concentration time extubation . Timing extubation discretion attend anesthesiologist caring patient accord usual practice . Following extubation observe patient second checklist fill detail event need continuous positive pressure 100 % oxygen , reintubation . The quality extubation score either `` successful , '' `` moderately successful , '' `` fail , '' accord predefined criterion ; see appendix 1.The investigator record oxygen saturation , respiratory rate , presence absence additional oxygen supplementation `` blow , '' `` mask oxygen '' `` nasal cannula '' arrival Post anesthesia care unit , 5 , 10 , 30 minute arrival post anesthesia care unit . The investigator also record post anesthesia care unit length stay define time arrival time nurse deems patient recover sufficiently leave post anesthesia care unit either home inhouse bed . Investigators record age , height , weight , gender , American society anesthesiologist status , type surgery , presence absence upper respiratory infection symptom previous 2 week , premedication , type inhalational agent use . Investigators observe patient le 7 year old base operating room schedule . The study perform Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center tertiary academic medical center . Subjects selection criterion Pediatric patient age 7 schedule surgery anesthesia endotracheal tube observe time extubation . • Inclusion Criteria Patients le 7 year age schedule surgery anesthesia endotracheal tube place airway management potent inhalational agent use anesthetic maintenance train study observer present extubation include . • Exclusion Criteria Patients use laryngeal mask airway supralaryngeal device airway management elective procedure . Patients tracheostomy place . Any case total intravenous anesthesia use . Patient mask alone use airway management . • Sample Size Using priori sample size calculator multiple regression analysis base effect size f2 0.05 model 7 predictor , probablility level 0.05 , statistical power 80 % estimate sample size 293 patient . The calculator find follow internet address : http : //www.danielsoper.com/statcalc/calculator.aspx ? id=1 Given number 293 patient observe 300 extubations . Interventions Interactions : Interventions interaction patient minimal since observational study . Study personnel monitor pediatric operating room schedule day look case endotracheal tube use airway management child less 7 year age . Study personnel consult responsible anesthesia team prospectively record data time emergence extubation . They also intermittently observe patient post anesthesia care unit may delegate record respiratory data post anesthesia care unit arrival , 5 , 10 , 30 minute . They also record post anesthesia care unit length stay . Outcome Measure ( ) Outcome measure successful , moderately successful fail extubation correlation , frequency , predictive value individual subjective objective criterion extubation . Analytical Plan Results analyze initially use descriptive statistic multivariate logistic regression analysis determine predictive value different criterion successful extubation determine one criterion predictive another . Human Subjects Protection Subject Recruitment Methods Study participant identify look pediatric operating room schedule consult anesthesia team responsible patient determine use endotracheal tube airway management plan extubate patient end procedure . If aforementioned acceptable patient meet age inclusion criterion member study available observe emergence record data base occur emergence extubation . Informed Consent Informed consent seek observational study design observe criterion use routine practice pediatric anesthesia determine time extubation . All clinical care administer discretion attend anesthesiologist accord routine standard practice .</detailed_description>
