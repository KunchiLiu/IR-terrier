	<brief_summary>Hepatitis C virus infection ( HCV ) major cause cirrhosis death liver disease worldwide . Current therapy HCV interferon base therapy result cure rate around 5055 % leave significant number patient without effective therapy . HCV induces ( bring ) insulin resistance insulin resistance factor know reduce response antiHCV therapy . This finding stimulate initial study look agent may reduce insulin resistance additional therapy HCV infection . A study use metformin addition interferon ribavirin show nonsignificant increase cure rate ( 53 % vs. 42 % ) , limited patient type 1 infection AND demonstrable insulin resistance . The assumption make potential effect metformin likely insulin resistance thus modulate enhances response . The investigator ( Prof M Harris , University Leeds ) data ( currently unpublished ) suggest metformin may antiviral effect independent effect insulin resistance , thus raise possibility metformin may direct antiviral effect vivo . Given development specific antiHCV agent target viral protein polymerase protease trial development far prove either highly toxic likely huge cost considerable rationale look alternative potential antiHCV agent context metformin cheap , readily available excellent safety profile . This pilot study therefore address question `` Does metformin therapy result significant drop HCV viral load chronically infect patient ? ''</brief_summary>
