	<brief_summary>Coronary compute tomography angiography ( CCTA ) frequently perform test diagnosis and/or exclusion coronary artery disease ( CAD ) appropriately select patient . The performance non-contrast compute tomography detection quantification coronary calcification typically perform prior CCTA effort identify significant calcification may influence subsequent data acquisition CCTA . However , performance calcium score add significant radiation coronary calcification proximal location , potentially visualize use focused non-contrast scan . The purpose study prospectively compare usefulness modify non-contrast CT , use significantly short scan length low radiation parameter , compare standard coronary artery calcium scan detection coronary calcification may influence subsequent CCTA performance .</brief_summary>
