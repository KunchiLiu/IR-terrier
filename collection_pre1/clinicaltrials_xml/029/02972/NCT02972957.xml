	<brief_summary>The live attenuated influenza vaccine ( LAIV ) make weaken influenza virus give nose early study show well standard influenza vaccine prevent infection child . However , recently , perform less well may also work less well Sub-Saharan Africa . Not investigator know , investigator also fully understand LAIV produce strong nasal antibody response individual others . Usually harmless bacteria present participant nose influence immune system work variation may explain difference LAIV work . The project recruit child give LAIV Gambia gain understand issue . The investigator measure variety response LAIV , include gene change expression early vaccination use advance computational technique identify new relationship gene LAIV response . The investigator also see whether nasal bacterial profile child respond LAIV different . In addition , investigator alter bacteria subset child antibiotic see whether affect nasal gene expression later responses LAIV .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Intranasal Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine Immunogenicity Associations With Nasopharyngeal Microbiome Among Children Gambia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose The overall goal study conduct detail immunogenicity study intranasal live attenuate influenza vaccine ( LAIV ; Nasovac-S , Serum Institute India Pvt . Ltd. ) , include identification early molecular signature associate robust mucosal immune response . In addition , study team explore whether nasopharyngeal microbiome influence immune response whether LAIV impact microbiome . A total 365 healthy child age 24 - 59 month recruit The Gambia study . Background Both burden infection use influenza vaccine child sub-Saharan Africa ( SSA ) neglect . There limited immunogenicity efficacy data SSA widely use Ann Arbor strain-derived LAIV . This LAIV show great relative efficacy compare inactivated influenza vaccine child early randomized-controlled trial . There , however , concern regard low vaccine effectiveness US recent year . The Serum Institute India Pvt . Ltd. recently develop trivalent LAIV ( Nasovac-S ) via WHO facilitate donation Russian-derived LAIV , intention scale provision LAIV resource-limited setting . Based initial safety immunogenicity data , Nasovac-S license India grant WHO prequalification certificate 2015 . Two placebo-controlled efficacy study use Nasovac-S recently undertake Bangladesh Senegal ( child age 24 - 59 month 24 - 71 month respectively ) , provide mixed contrast result . In Senegal , efficacy find circulate pandemic H1N1 influenza strain ( -9.7 % , 95 % CI -62.6 , 26.1 ) . In Bangladesh overall vaccine efficacy vaccine-matched strain , study identical design , 57.5 % ( 95 % CI 43.6 , 68.0 ) , efficacy H1N1 H3N2 , 50.0 % ( 95 % CI 9.2 , 72.5 ) 60.4 % ( 95 % CI 44.8 , 71.6 ) respectively . The reason discrepancy study poorer performance H1N1 component clear emphasize need undertake detailed immunogenicity study vaccine SSA . On wider note , exact immunological mechanism action LAIV also under-explored . Study type : Interventional Design : All primary objective address conduct phase 4 , randomize , control clinical vaccine trial . A total 330 healthy child age 24 - 59 month enrol one three group equal size ( 3 x 110 child ) : ( ) LAIV-vaccinated ( Group A - blood sample day 0 , 2 , 21 ) ( ii ) LAIV-vaccinated ( Group B - blood sample day 0 , 7 , 21 ) ( iii ) Control group ( Group C ) The study blind , group allocation conceal investigator team block randomization stratify sex undertaken . Two LAIV-vaccinated group include order achieve several exploratory objective , require blood sampling different time follow vaccination , whilst minimize number time child bleed . The unvaccinated subject serve control group primary objective assess impact LAIV nasopharyngeal microbiome . An additional 35 healthy child age 24 - 59 month recruit 2nd phase recruitment ( approximately Jan - June 2018 ) ass modulation nasopharyngeal microbiome antibiotic impact mucosal immunogenicity LAIV . These subject match closely possible pre-antibiotic nasopharyngeal microbiome profile , age sex ( order preference ) , exploratory nest case-control study , n = 35 child recruit main clinical trial . Official title A Study Intranasal Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine Immunogenicity Associations Nasopharyngeal Microbiome Among Children Gambia ( The NASIMMUNE study ) Primary outcome measure - To identify novel early systemic mucosal molecular signature follow LAIV associate subsequent robust nasal oral influenza-specific immunoglobulin A ( IgA ) response , order provide insight mechanism successful mucosal immunization - To identify association nasopharyngeal microbiota nasal oral influenza-specific IgA responses post-LAIV Gambian child , explore whether microbiome variability explain suboptimal immune response individual live intranasal mucosal vaccine Sub-Saharan Africa - To establish whether LAIV impact nasopharyngeal microbiome , specific focus burden S. pneumoniae</detailed_description>
