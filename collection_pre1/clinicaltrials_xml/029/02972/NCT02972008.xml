	<brief_summary>Over past ten year , number endovascular procedure increase 5 % per year Europe development interventional cardiology , percutaneous coronary angioplasty , aortic valve replacement ( TAVR ) , vascular endoprosthesis . The neurological lesion detect cerebral MRI cause endovascular procedure frequent incidence 30-70 % . These event , although subclinical , impact morbidity mortality especially long-term cognitive decline . TAVR reference treatment symptomatic elderly patient stenosis aortic valve , consider multidisciplinary `` Heart Team '' high surgical risk due comorbidities , age high perioperative risk score ( Euroscore 2 STS score ) . Despite net clinical benefit , increase silent neurological event detect post-procedural cerebral MRI incidence approximately 70 % . The epigenetic involvement occurrence ischemic cerebral lesion still largely unknown . Epigenetic mechanism , DNA methylation , associate age process modulate risk develop cerebrovascular pathology . They likely provide new biomarkers predict risk brain damage . Hypomethylation leukocyte DNA directly related atherosclerosis human . This hypomethylation DNA would represent easily measurable marker reflect presence progression atherosclerosis . Because atherosclerotic lesion often precede clinical manifestation ischemic cardiovascular disease , ischemic heart disease stroke , DNA hypomethylation could use identify individual risk cerebrovascular event . The investigator hypothesize hypomethylation leukocyte DNA predict risk develop new ischemic brain lesion especially TAVI procedure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This french multicenter prospective cohort study . Patients severe symptomatic aortic stenosis refer TAVI procedure cardiology department university hospital Lille , Caen , Amiens Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital ( APHP ) analyze inclusion prospective study . The case select discussion member local TAVI `` Heart Team '' ( cardiologist , cardiac surgeon , anesthetist ) , recommend guideline European Society Cardiology . Written consent obtain accordance international recommendation clinical research ( Helsinki Declaration ) . Participation study propose patient preoperative consultation . The collection clinical data , include postoperative cerebral MRI , collect prospectively hospitalization clinical visit institution one year . An evaluation cognitive function perform mini-mental state ( MMS ) day TAVI intervention 1 year . The study end last evaluation . A cerebral MRI perform within 1-3 day TAVI procedure detect new cerebral ischemic lesion ( embolus ) . Blood sample take patient 's stay : day TAVI , procedure TAVI procedure day 1 day 4 . The follow-up visit 1 year conduct cardiologist cardiac surgeon evaluation cognitive function mini-mental state ( MMS ) .</detailed_description>
