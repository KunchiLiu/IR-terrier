	<detailed_description>SPECIFIC AIMS Tobacco use among woman approach men , approximately 27 million woman smoker United States alone . Lung cancer lead cause cancer death among woman , 180,000 woman die illness link smoke annually . Women report great difficulty quit smoke likely relapse men . In addition , tobacco use co-varies poor dietary practice lack physical activity , 92 % smoker report least one health risk factor . The presence multiple behavioral risk factor greatly increase risk develop many acute chronic condition . Concerns weight gain , negative body image , lack self-efficacy may key factor affect smoking , diet , exercise behavior woman . Women smoker less satisfied body , low self-esteem , concerned become overweight non-smokers . Approximately 50 % woman smoker report concern body weight reason quit . Research indicate woman report low self-efficacy quit men , especially woman concerned control weight . These finding suggest target weight concern , body image , self-efficacy quit weight-concerned woman smoke may effective intervention strategy . Recent study suggest multi-behavioral approach , include diet physical activity , may effective help weight-concerned smoker quit . One cognitive approach , guide imagery , successfully employ separate line inquiry address body image concern self-efficacy three target behaviorsâ€”exercise , diet smoke cessation . However , guide imagery employ target weight concerned woman smoke simultaneously target smoking , diet , exercise behavior single intervention . The propose study would first kind create theory-based , guided imagery intervention assist weight-concerned woman smoker quit . While imagery effective therapeutic tool behavior change , mode delivery generally in-person , limit dissemination guide imagery-based intervention large population . Mobile health application ( mobile apps ) deliver via smart phone offer unique channel distribute imagery-based intervention . Mobile apps may enhance use guided imagery use audio file . The app may allow guide imagery script tailor user , flexibly administer vary time ( e.g. , nicotine craving ) . This approach could especially useful woman , likely men use Internet obtain health information . The use mobile app offer innovative approach address multiple behavior involve smoke cessation effort weight-concerned woman , potential reach large number woman smoker . If successful , mobile application guide imagery could use address health behavior well . The present project aim develop test feasibility mobile health application use guide imagery order increase smoke cessation among weight-concerned woman smoker . The Specific Aims study : Aim 1 . Develop guided imagery content , user interface , resource reduce weight concern , increase body image self-efficacy behavior change among weight-concerned woman smoker . Scripts incorporate imagery across domain develop specifically smoke cessation , eat healthy diet engage physical activity . The investigator develop initial content user interface idea base experience use guided imagery increase physical activity , use technology assist tobacco cessation healthy eating . Ten focus group participant ( weight-concerned woman smoker smart phone , represent various racial/ethnic group ) provide feedback content , potential tailoring content race/ethnicity , function , design , inform development mobile app . Aim 2 . Program prototype app contain necessary element text , graphic , multimedia interactive feature . Users able customize certain element application , require provide input response app prompt . The investigator conduct usability testing , observe 10 participant use `` think aloud '' procedure interact app , ensure fully functional easy use . Aim 3 . Evaluate feasibility , acceptability , preliminary efficacy app 50 weight-concerned woman smoker . The primary outcome self-reported tobacco abstinence 3 month post-enrollment . The investigator also measure : dietary intake ; level physical activity ; body image ; self-efficacy ; craving ; participant ' use app , include imagery script , diary , resource link . The potential impact propose intervention great , address behavioral risk factor apply population beyond smoker . This proposal significant intervenes woman smoker ; innovative , use guided imagery change lifestyle behavior important prevention chronic disease , , technology maximize dissemination potential . The propose investigation take theory-based approach , build considerable track record investigator , conduct environment highly suit study . Results study use prepare future randomize control trial test efficacy cost-effectiveness multi-behavioral , guided imagery mobile health application versus single smoking cessation imagery mobile health application .</detailed_description>
