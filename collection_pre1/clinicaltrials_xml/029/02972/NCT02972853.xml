	<brief_summary>The purpose study 1 ) determine whether Mindfulness Training Primary Care ( see study `` MINDFUL-PC : Integrating Mindfulness Into Patient-Centered Medical Home - A Pilot Study '' ) improve chronic disease management 2 ) change brain activation neuroimaging task compare training . Neuroimaging fMRI task probe mechanism relate self-regulation , attention/inhibition , emotion regulation , self-compassion , interoception pain regulation . The study also look whether successful chronic disease management relate observed brain activation change compare mindfulness intervention .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mindful Self-Regulation fMRI Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study aim test brain activation change relate potential self-regulation target ( attention/inhibition , emotion regulation , self-compassion , interoception pain regulation ) influence mindfulness training within primary care ( compare Mindful-PC study ) . The study also look whether successful chronic disease self-efficacy relate observed brain activation change compare mindfulness intervention . The study examine relationship mindfulness training within primary care medical regimen adherence ( initiation maintenance ) well underlie neural correlate associate change self-regulation . This single-arm pilot trial , recruit randomize control trial ( see Mindful-PC study ) . Following completion pilot trial , study modify include promise self-regulation target , integrate subsequent study ( different clinicaltrials.gov ID # ) test change brain activity relate intervention control trial large sample .</detailed_description>
