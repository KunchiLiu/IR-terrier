	<brief_summary>This open label non-comparative control randomized phase II study . The experimental arm group receive ODM-201 . The group receive androgen-deprivation therapy ( ADT ) include internal control . The primary trial objective demonstrate ODM-201 produce prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) response rate 24 week ( define ≥80 % reduction compare baseline ) range achieve 24 week ADT . In total , 1:1 randomize study therefore require randomization least 250 patient , 125 arm .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>ODM 201 administer oral 300-mg tablet . The dose study drug administer 600 milligram ( mg ) ( 2 x 300-mg tablet ) twice daily ( bid ) daily dose 1200 mg . It recommend ODM-201 take food . Subjects clinical benefit week 24 may continue receive ODM-201 discretion investigator disease progression , objective clinical , occurrence unacceptable toxicity . This include receive external beam radiation therapy . Any anti-cancer therapy study drug give single agent consider part protocol treatment . The standard treatment stage disease androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) mean Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone ( LHRH ) antagonist 24 week LHRH agonist therapy 24 week 4 week anti-androgen prevent flare . This include leuprolide , goserelin , triptorelin , degarelix . Beyond week 24 , treatment leave discretion treat physician . The primary trial objective demonstrate ODM-201 produce prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) response rate 24 week ( define ≥80 % reduction compare baseline ) range achieve 24 week ADT . The secondary objective : - To document effect ODM-201 compare ADT term patient-reported side effect hormonal therapy , base Hormonal treatment ( HTR ) symptom scale EORTC QLQ PR25 24 week ; - To document effect ODM-201 compare ADT term patient-reported side effect hormonal therapy , base EORTC QLQ C30 PR25 24 week ; - To document effect ODM-201 PSA complete response 24 week ( define ≥ 90 % reduction baseline ) ; - To document effect ODM-201 objective response rate 24 week patient RECIST 1.1 measurable disease baseline ; - To document safety tolerability ODM-201 vs. ADT subject previously receive hormone treatment prostate cancer ; - To document effect ODM-201 androgen deprivation symptoms use Aging male symptom ( AMS ) questionnaires ; - To document proportion patient opt continue treatment ODM-201 beyond protocolized 24 week The primary endpoint PSA response assess 24 week . PSA response define ≥ 80 % decline PSA measurement take week 24 relative measurement take baseline , ODM-201 study arm . The ADT arm use internal control . Key secondary endpoint : - Change hormone-treatment related symptom scale EORTC QLQ-PR25 24 week compare baseline ODM-201 study arm . A 10-point difference regard clinically meaningful benefit . - Objective response rate 24 week patient RECIST 1.1 measurable disease baseline - PSA response 24 week define ≥90 % decline PSA compare baseline - Safety accord National Cancer Institute - Common terminology adverse event ( NCI-CTC ) version 4.0</detailed_description>
