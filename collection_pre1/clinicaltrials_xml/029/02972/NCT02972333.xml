	<criteria>1 . Provision sign date write informed consent patient legally acceptable representative prior studyspecific procedure 2 . Metastatic ( stage IV ) EGFRm NSCLC , amenable curative surgery radiotherapy , confirmation presence T790M mutation . 3 . For patient LM : Confirmed diagnosis LM positive CSF cytology . Diagnosis MRI eligible study entry . At least one site CNS leptomeningeal disease assess magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) suitable repeat assessment . Measurable CNS extracranial disease require . 4 . For patient measurable BM without LM : At least one measurable intracranial lesion , previously irradiate , progress respond radiation therapy , accurately measure baseline â‰¥ 10 mm long diameter magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) suitable accurate repeat measurement . Measurable extracranial disease require . 5 . Prior therapy EGFRTKI . Patients may also receive additional line treatment . 6 . World Health Organization ( WHO ) performance status 02 deterioration previous 2 week minimum life expectancy 3 month . 7 . Adequate bone marrow reserve organ function demonstrate complete blood count , biochemistry blood urine baseline . 8 . ECG record baseline show absence cardiac abnormality per exclusion criterion # 10 . 9 . Female patient childbearing potential must use adequate contraceptive measure ( see Restrictions , Section 3.5 ) , must breast feeding , must negative pregnancy test prior start dose . Otherwise , must evidence nonchild bear potential define : 1 . Postmenopausal define age 50 year amenorrheic least 12 month follow cessation exogenous hormonal treatment 2 . Women le 50 year would consider postmenopausal amenorrheic 12 month follow cessation exogenous hormonal treatment luteinizing hormone folliclestimulating hormone level postmenopausal range institution 3 . Documentation irreversible surgical sterilisation hysterectomy , bilateral oophorectomy bilateral salpingectomy tubal ligation 10 . Male patient must willing use barrier contraception , i.e. , condom . Subjects enter study follow exclusion criterion fulfil : 1 . Previous ( within 6 month ) current treatment AZD9291 2 . Patients currently receive ( unable stop use least 1 week prior receive first dose AZD9291 ) treatment know potent inhibitor inducer cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) 3A4 ( Appendix B ) 3 . Any evidence severe uncontrolled systemic disease , include uncontrolled hypertension , active bleeding diatheses , active infection* include hepatitis B , hepatitis C human immunodeficiency virus , significantly impair bone marrow reserve organ function , include hepatic renal impairment , investigator 's opinion would significantly alter risk/benefit balance . * active infection include patient receive intravenous treatment infection patient hepatitis B C surface antigen ( + ) Patients receive oral antiviral suppressive therapy hepatitis B C permit enrol study . 4 . Patient symptomatic central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases neurologically unstable require increase dos steroid manage CNS symptom within 2 week prior start AZD9291 administration . 5 . Prior whole brain radiation therapy . 6 . Known intracranial hemorrhage unrelated tumor . 7 . For patient LM and/or BM , CNS complication require urgent neurosurgical intervention ( e.g . resection shunt placement ) . 8 . For patient LM , inability undergo collection CSF . 9 . Past medical history ILD , druginduced ILD , radiation pneumonitis require steroid treatment , evidence clinically active ILD 10 . Any following cardiac criterion : 1 . Mean resting correct QT interval ( QTcF ) &gt; 470 m use Fredericia 's formula : 2 . Any clinically important abnormality rhythm , conduction morphology rest ECG ( e.g. , complete leave bundle branch block , third degree heart block , second degree heart block ) 3 . Any factor increase risk QTc prolongation risk arrhythmic event 11 . Any unresolved toxicity prior therapy CTCAE &gt; grade 3 time start treatment 12 . History hypersensitivity excipients AZD9291 drug similar chemical structure class AZD9291 13 . Inadequate bone marrow reserve organ function demonstrate follow laboratory value : Absolute neutrophil count &lt; 1.5 x 10^9/L Platelet count &lt; 100 x 10^9/L Haemoglobin &lt; 90 g/L Alanine aminotransferase &gt; 2.5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) demonstrable liver metastasis &gt; 5 time ULN presence liver metastases Aspartate aminotransferase &gt; 2.5 time ULN demonstrable liver metastasis &gt; 5 time ULN presence liver metastases Total bilirubin &gt; 1.5 time ULN . Total bilirubin &gt; 3 time ULN patient document Gilbert 's Syndrome ( unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia ) presence liver metastases Creatinine &gt; 1.5 time ULN concurrent creatinine clearance &lt; 50 mL/min ( measure calculate Cockcroft Gault equation ) . Confirmation creatinine clearance require creatinine &gt; 1.5 time ULN . If bone metastases present liver function otherwise consider adequate investigator elevate ALP exclude patient .</criteria>
