	<brief_title>PTH ( 1-34 ) Pelvic Fracture Healing - Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The incidence rate pelvic fracture increase dramatically age , 5.4 3.8 per 10,000 person-years woman men age 65 69 year 93.5 44.5 per 10,000 person-years woman men age 90 year old , respectively . Pelvic fracture accompany severe pain , chronic immobility loss function independence elderly . Pelvic fracture consume substantial healthcare resource , base administrative claim data , one costly osteoporosis related fracture . Un-healed fracture , occur one-third pelvic fracture patient 3 month , cause continue pain impact mobility . With age population , expect concomitant increase incidence pelvic fracture , press need find effective treatment accelerate heal . Fracture pubic ramus relevant practical randomize double-blinded placebo control study fracture accompany severe pain immobility elderly , associate delayed fracture healing , almost always treat non-operatively . The current standard care pelvic fracture include pain management , patient mobilization , prevention complication associate comorbid condition . The investigator hypothesize development successful adjunctive therapy accelerate fracture heal would lead improve care reduce direct indirect cost pelvic fracture . In proposed trial investigator recruit woman men &gt; 65 year age acute osteoporosis-related pelvic fracture address 3 specific aim 3 month treatment placebo control double blind study determine standard care teriparatide 20 mcg/day versus placebo pelvic fracture : 1 . Results earlier evidence cortical bridging routine radiograph follow confirmatory Focus CT , novel method reduce radiation exposure CT scan ( primary outcome ) . 2 . Leads fast reduction pain assess Numeric Rating Scale reduction use narcotic ( secondary outcome ) . 3 . Leads rapidly improve functional outcome use short physical performance battery ass low extremity function ( secondary outcome ) . The investigator extend study 9 month open label TPTD determine potential difference placebo TPTD group 3 month treatment evident persist time , even patient use TPTD three month placebo control intervention . If TPTD improve fracture healing , study impact treatment person pelvic fracture surgical candidate often face severe pain , chronic immobility , loss function elderly . A positive finding accelerate heal pelvic fracture would also encourage study TPTD treatment osteoporotic fracture .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Postmenopausal woman men &gt; 65 year age acute pelvic fracture , occur minimal trauma , present Helen Hayes Hospital , Hospital Special Surgery , New York Hospital ( Cornell Medical ) within one week onset symptom . Patients either one multiple pelvic fracture sacral pelvic fracture include study . 1 . Persons unable complete NRS survey base minimental status score ( â‰¤18 ; consistent moderate severe cognitive impairment ) 2 . Previously ( prior fracture ) nonambulatory subject 3 . Exclusion criterion relate contraindication intolerance TPTD : 1 . Hypersensitivity TPTD 2 . Patients increase risk osteosarcoma : Paget 's disease , history radiation exposure 3 . Patients active hypercalcemia 4 . Current hyperparathyroidism metabolic bone disease include osteogenesis imperfecta 5 . History multiple renal calculus renal calculus within last 2 year 6 . Normal alkaline phosphatase level use entrance criterion fracture patient elevation due acute fracture . However , investigator attempt obtain lab test period prior fracture determine normal . If unexplained elevation alkaline phosphatase find labs prior fracture exclude subject . 7 . Evidence metastatic cancer history bone cancer active cancer basal squamous cell carcinoma .</criteria>
