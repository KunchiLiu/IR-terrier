	<brief_summary>Imaging use 11C-acetate PET ( positron emission tomography ) patient tuberculosis ( TB ) may able detect non-replicating persister bacillus . This may permit identification patient risk relapse follow completion TB treatment . The main aim pilot study assess ability 11C-acetate PET detect pulmonary lesion individual active pulmonary TB .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation 11C-acetate PET Imaging Novel Approach Detecting Pathology Pulmonary TB</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Novel biomarkers detect pulmonary TB response treatment sorely need . PET conjunction either CT ( compute tomography ) MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) scanning allow assessment metabolic activity lesion well structural anatomy lung . The standard radiolabelled tracer PET 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) label metabolically active cell . However , one main limitation FDG non-specific uptake lead difficulty differentiate tumour , infection inflammatory pathology . 11C-acetate PET ligand use currently image various condition use identify TB lesion previously . 11C-acetate may take lipid body dormant bacteria TB , enable visualization sub-population bacteria . Using 11C-acetate ligand image pulmonary TB may add utility PET scanning , potentially allow monitor drug activity persister population identification patient may risk relapse follow drug therapy . This pilot study compare 11C-acetate standard ligand , FDG , use PET/CT PET/MRI . The target population study individual confirm pulmonary TB high chance demonstrable bacillary burden therefore likely population persister bacteria lung .</detailed_description>
