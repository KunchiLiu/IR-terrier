	<brief_summary>The aim study evaluate efficacy N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) add-on antidepressant medication treat patient relieve standard antidepressant treatment 6 week least . Meanwhile , secondary outcome include change biomarkers specifically local brain activity ( functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging , fMRI ) white matter integrity ( Diffusion Tensor Imaging , DTI ) . The hypothesis study NAC positive effect refractory major depressive disorder patient increase inflammatory activity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It 's double-blind randomise placebo control antidepressant augmentation study 12-week treatment 8-week follow . Its purpose investigate antidepressant efficacy safety NAC patient treatment resistant depression ( TRD ) define insufficient response 1 antidepressant give least 6 week adequate dose , display increased peripheral inflammatory activity moderate severe depression . Apart study effect NAC depression severity , secondary outcome examine range biomarkers relate potentially important underlying mechanism oxidative stress inflammatory activity evaluate effect brain functioning ( fMRI ) white matter integrity ( DTI ) . Scale assessment perform week precede initiation treatment , treatment period , end treatment period 8-week follow . Neuro-imaging perform treatment start week 12 , study medication terminate . Collection blood morning urine take place three time point , week precede initiation treatment , closely taper study medication end 8-week follow . This study hop show NAC perform positive effect aspect mention .</detailed_description>
