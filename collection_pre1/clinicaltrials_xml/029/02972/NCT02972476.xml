	<brief_summary>A randomise control trial test hypothesis inhale therapy chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) differential effect upper airway microbiome . COPD third lead cause death worldwide . Exacerbations drive disease progression worsen quality life therefore prevention exacerbation major goal treatment . Patients COPD frequently prescribe inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS ) show reduce exacerbation combination long act beta2-adrenoceptor agonist ( LABA ) . In recent year , ICS preparation associate significant increase risk pneumonia either randomise trial observational study lead warning national regulatory authority lead expert . This lead re-evaluation role ICS COPD treatment . It likely risk pneumonia equal across ICS dose molecule . There compel rationale ICS strong effect upper airway microbiome , may one mechanism increase pneumonia risk drug . The exist literature regard ICS pneumonia risk lacking ; 1 ) head head trial compare different ICS preparation 2 ) comparator study date long act beta2-adrenoceptor agonist alone , whereas appropriate comparator current management would combine LABA long-acting muscarinic antagonist ( LAMA ) . The MUSIC TRIAL multi-centre randomise open label control parallel group study four treatment arm total 120 participant . Severe COPD patient currently treat inhale corticosteroid therapy randomise treatment one three preparation ICS combination LABA control arm dual bronchodilator therapy follow four week washout period . Participants return monthly determine change microbiome upper airway . This study establish one potential mechanism increase susceptibility pneumonia ICS user assess intraclass difference ICS molecule effect ICS dose microbiome . Demonstrating different COPD treatment different effect lung microbiome important step understand clinical difference safety effectiveness different treatment severe COPD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS ) commonly prescribed patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , role management COPD currently re-evaluated light new evidence emergence alternative treatment . Studies show use ICS particularly ICS combine long acting beta2-adrenoceptor agonist ( LABA ) individual COPD reduce frequency COPD exacerbations improve health status lung function compare LABA alone placebo . The current National Institute Care Excellence ( NICE ) guideline COPD recommend ICS patient force expiratory volume 1 second 50 % predict , patient higher lung function persist symptom exacerbation despite treatment long acting bronchodilator . Data suggest 75 % patient COPD United Kingdom ( UK ) subsequently prescribe ICS . The daily dose ICS utilise COPD treatment much high used asthma treatment , license daily dos 1000 mcg fluticasone propionate ( 2000 mcg beclomethasone dipropionate ( BDP ) equivalent ) 800 mcg budesonide ( 800 mcg BDP equivalent ) . Recent concern express safety ICS COPD follow several randomise control trial fluticasone propionate fluticasone furoate , among others , demonstrate increase rate pneumonia adverse event . Several systematic review observational study confirm association ICS use risk pneumonia . All ICS preparation associate increase risk pneumonia either randomise trial observational study lead warning national regulatory authority lead expert . It likely however , risk pneumonia equal across ICS dose molecule . Research area greatly limit lack head head comparison different ICS preparation COPD . It hypothesise anti-inflammatory immunosuppressive effect ICS lead increase susceptibility colonisation upper respiratory tract pathogenic bacteria associate pneumonia S. pneumoniae Haemophilus influenzae . This study establish one potential mechanism increase susceptibility pneumonia ICS user assess intraclass difference ICS molecule use COPD effect ICS dose . It known change microbiome COPD associate disease severity lung inflammation . Demonstrating different COPD treatment different effect lung microbiome important step understand clinical difference safety effectiveness different treatment severe COPD . The long term clinical objective study therefore determine whether proportion patient COPD might safely manage either low dose , pharmacologically different ICS preparation LABA/LAMA therapy reduce risk pneumonia . Hypothesis Fluticasone propionate facilitate high level bacterial airway colonisation pathogen associate pneumonia compare budesonide treatment exclusively bronchodilator , therefore provide mechanistic explanation increase pneumonia risk associate ICS . STUDY OBJECTIVES To determine potential mechanism inhale corticosteroid associate pneumonia COPD demonstrate ICS effect upper ( throat nasal swab ) low airway ( sputum ) microbiome . To determine mechanism observed difference pneumonia risk fluticasone propionate , budesonide demonstrate differential effect airway microbiome .</detailed_description>
