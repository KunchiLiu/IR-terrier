	<brief_summary>The main purpose study unravel mechanism `` Low Viral Reservoir Treated '' patient ( LoViReT ) maintain extremely low HIV-1 DNA level despite initiated cART chronic HIV-1 infection . This group may specific different clinical , virological immunogenetical characteristic , compare patient regular reservoir size , might useful design new effective treatment approach .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>LoViReT ( Low Viral Reservoir Treated Patients )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Combination antiretroviral therapy ( cART ) highly successful suppress HIV-1 replication clinical progression infect patient . However , hamper establishment viral reservoir , generate latently infect cell provoke quick rebound HIV viremia treatment interruption . Different strategy tackle HIV-1 reservoir suggest last year limit success . Actually , case describe HIV-1 functional cure find elite post-treatment controller . Thus , patient regular HIV progression control replication spontaneously , receive cART primary HIV-1 infection . Indeed , `` Mississippi baby '' , treat 36h birth , sustain undetectable viremia 27 month treatment interruption . Recently , also prove successfully treated patient low proviral reservoir relate well HIV-1 control treatment discontinuation . Thus , identification patient lower latent reservoir chronic infection allow unveil potential mechanism achieve functional cure cART withdrawal . Our center Badalona allocate biological sample collection contain 72,000 specimen HIV-1-infected subject . Samples 319 patient suppressive cART 3 year screen use high sensitive BioRad droplet digital Polymerase Chain Reaction platform ( ddPCR ) . Among screened patient , cohort 20 `` Low Viral Reservoir Treated '' patient ( LoViReT ) extremely low undetectable HIV-1 DNA level peripheral blood despite initiated cART chronic HIV-1 infection establish , expect increase 40 patient . Discovering factor reduce HIV reservoir make LoViReT patient maintain extremely low level proviral HIV-1 DNA open new treatment strategy base maintain reservoir low level beside regular clinical marker viral load . In addition , second step control cART interruption design evaluate real impact harbor extremely low level latent reservoir functional HIV cure . To unravel mechanism LoViReT cohort maintain extremely low HIV-1 DNA level despite initiated cART chronic HIV-1 infection , cohort study different point view . All result compare control group 40 individual standard level total HIV DNA ( reservoir ) . Three mayor aim address extrapolate result large chronic HIV-1-infected population : - To investigate role cART suppression HIV reservoir LoViReT patient , compare control . To address objective , longitudinal analysis proviral HIV DNA patient perform , include time point previous cART . In total , 200 sample analyze dynamic model build two different level reservoir establishment . General immune phenotype cellular population , include also activation marker , also assess time point . - To investigate integrity HIV sequence LoViReT patient relationship pathogenesis , comparison control . Genotypic HIV tropism full viral genome analyze sequence DNA patient ' Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells ( PBMC ) . Fresh blood sample take 40 LoViReT 40 control patient study . In addition , exert virus production , viral isolates use analyze viral replication capacity cell pathogenesis . - To investigate role immune-genetic factor along cART contribute reduce HIV reservoir LoViReT patient . Functional T-cell response measure isolate CD8 T cell measure inhibition capacity HIV replication patient . Specific HIV-related CD8 T-cell interferon production also evaluate epitope stimulus . Other progression associate genetic factor Human Leukocyte Antigen ( HLA ) type , CCR5 , CCR2 SIGLEC-1 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms ( SNPs ) also explore .</detailed_description>
