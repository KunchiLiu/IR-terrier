	<brief_title>Does Propranolol Attenuate Inflammatory Responses Psychological Stressor ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Psychological stress implicate onset progression many common costly chronic disease , include cardiovascular disease , chronic pain condition , major depressive disorder ( Cohen et al. , 2007 ; Kendler et al. , 1999 ; Steptoe KivimaÌˆki , 2012 ) . An emerge body evidence suggest inflammation , indexed via level pro-inflammatory cytokine reactive protein , may key biological mechanism stress affect health ( Baker et al. , 2012 ; Miller et al. , 2009 ; Slavich et al. , 2010 ) . Indeed , psychological stressor induce increase inflammation ( Slavich Irwin , 2014 ; Kiecolt-Glaser et al. , 2003 ; Rohleder , 2014 ; Steptoe et al. , 2007 ) , great level inflammation may contribute development disease ( Capuron Miller , 2004 ; Choy Panayi , 2001 ; DellaGiola Hannestad , 2010 ; Raison Miller , 2013 ; The Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration , 2010 ) . Despite grow literature link stress , inflammation , poor health , little known precise physiological mechanism link psychological stress increase inflammation . One hypothesize mechanism may translate psychological stress increase level inflammation activation sympathetic nervous system ( SNS ) . The SNS part autonomic nervous system primarily indexed release catecholamine epinephrine ( adrenaline ) norepinephrine ( noradrenaline ) . Prior research non-human animal model show stress-induced SNS activation lead increase level pro-inflammatory cytokine inflammation ( Bierhaus et al. , 2003 ; DeRijk et al. , 1994 ; Kop et al. , 2008 ; van Gool et al. , 1990 ) , pharmacologically block sympathetic activation attenuate inflammatory response stress ( Bierhaus et al. , 2003 ) . However , know human study date examine relationship psychological stress , SNS activation , inflammation . The present study design address major gap knowledge physiological mechanism may link stress disease . A potential reason lack human research link stress , SNS activation , inflammation SNS activity difficult measure . Indeed , adrenaline noradrenaline release bloodstream rapidly stressor , make kinetics difficult capture typical laboratory-based stress paradigm . Indirect measure SNS activity may acquire use psychophysiological approach involve peripheral measure electrical activity efficiency heart ; however , method provide indirect indicator SNS activity , make subject criticism psychoneuroimmunology community . To circumvent issue assessment SNS activity , present study employ psychopharmacological approach experimentally block SNS activity use drug propranolol . Propranolol beta-blocker medication commonly prescribed physician United States treatment hypertension , give block adrenergic receptor lead relaxation cardiac muscle smooth muscle tissue . Interestingly , propranolol also sometimes prescribed individual performance anxiety ( i.e. , public speaking anxiety ) , reduce SNS activity ( i.e. , eliminate increased heart rate , blood pressure , sweaty palm , etc. , typically accompany anxiety-provoking situation ) anecdotally observed decrease perception stress situation . Psychological scientist recently become interested role SNS activity may play formation reconsolidation fear memory , number study use propranolol investigate block SNS activity may help treat individual Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ; Pitman et al. , 2002 ; Vaiva et al. , 2003 ) . However , one know study date investigate propranolol reduces stress-induced immune system activation ( Benschop et al. , 1994 ) , ( date ) study specifically explore propranolol reduces inflammatory response stress . Furthermore , know study examine block SNS activity propranolol change individual ' appraisal stressful situation , affective response stress . Results study complement extend exist work SNS activity affect fear memory stress focus propranolol affect inflammatory psychological response stressor . In addition primary goal present study , investigator also explore role SNS activation number additional task hypothesize affected sympathetic arousal . More specifically , investigator examine exposure propranolol eliminate implicit bias toward out-group member ( case , African Americans ) , give large literature suggest many White Americans hold implicit bias African Americans ( Wittenbrink et al. , 1997 ; Nosek et al. , 2002 ) . While hypothesize sympathetic arousal base cultural stereotype associate African Americans negativity may lead implicit bias , know study investigate issue . The investigator also explore SNS activation critical empathy , individual 's ability understand emotional state others , avoid risky decision , moral judgment . Thus , study also answer number important , unanswered question social psychology regard role sympathetic arousal play fundamental psychological process . In sum , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled study propranolol shed important light SNS activation influence psychological inflammatory response stress . Results study inform basic science literature attempt map physiological mechanism psychological stress may lead poor mental physical health , may also ultimately therapeutic relevance individual experience high level stress put health risk . By utilize psychopharmacological approach , investigator circumvent many challenge conduct research human population . The investigator also place draw strong conclusion regard causality , give experimentally manipulate SNS activation , rather rely correlational measure SNS activity difficult ass appropriate ask SNS activity cause change psychology biology .</detailed_description>
