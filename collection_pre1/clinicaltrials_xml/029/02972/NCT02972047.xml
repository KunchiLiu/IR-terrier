	<brief_title>Understanding Pathophysiology Effects Diaphragmatic Breathing Upright Gastroesophageal Reflux</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There two major pattern gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) , predominantly daytime upright reflux predominantly nocturnal supine reflux . Traditionally , upright reflux attribute frequent wider open transient low esophageal sphincter relaxation ( TLESRs ) supine reflux result consistently reduce low esophageal sphincter ( LES ) pressure . This may account find large hiatal hernia great pressure gradient crura LES compare supine upright refluxers . These finding may help explain supine reflux , offer little insight mechanism upright reflux . In study investigator recruit twenty healthy person 60 patient GERD recruit clinical practice Mayo Clinic Rochester . The investigator aim study intervention 40 patient GERD . However , recognize 33 % patient typical symptom GERD reflux ambulatory pH monitoring ( pH power hydration ) , investigator provide enrol maximum 60 patient sufficient yield 40 patient upright GERD pH monitoring . In addition , 10 additional healthy person may recruit . Subjects upright reflux healthy control randomize one two group : Experimental : Diaphragmatic breathing Sham comparator : ( listen music/watching Television ( TV ) 30 minute meal see impact disease .</detailed_description>
