	<criteria>Informed consent sign . Male female participant least 18 year age Visit 1 . A diagnosis complex regional pain syndrome accord clinical diagnostic criterion recommend International Association Study Pain ( IASP ; `` Budapest clinical criterion '' ) , assess Visit 1 . Signs symptoms CRPS must apply affected limb ( arm leg ) must demonstrate asymmetry respect contralateral limb . Ongoing moderate severe chronic pain , include baseline current pain intensity score great equal 4 use 11point Numerical Rating Scale refer CRPSaffected limb , Visit 2 ( prior dosing ) . In stable treatment followup therapy CRPS least 1 month prior allocation treatment ( Visit 2 ) . Women childbearing potential must negative urine betahuman chorionic gonadotropin ( βHCG ) pregnancy test Visit 1 must use 2 form medically acceptable contraception , include least 1 highly effective method contraception low failure rate , define less 1 % per year ( e.g. , oral contraceptive intrauterine device ) , second medically acceptable method use condom spermicide male partner . A barrier method alone acceptable . Highly effective method contraception must use least 2 month prior Visit 2 duration trial . Participants must able communicate meaningfully , able differentiate regard location intensity pain , able answer question questionnaire use trial ( assistance fill questionnaire may provide , require due motor impairment ) . Evidence renal impairment ( estimate glomerular filtration rate [ eGFR ] le 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 use 2009 Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration [ CKDEPI ] creatinine equation [ Levey et al . 2009 ] urinary albumin creatinine ratio great 30 mg/g ) , base central safety laboratory data , history chronic kidney disease . Note : If 2 consecutive laboratory test indicate eGFR level great equal 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 single repeat laboratory test urinary albumin creatinine ratio le 30 mg/g enrollment period , subject eligible . Serum calcium magnesium outside central laboratory 's reference range , base central safety laboratory data obtain prior Visit 2 ( single repeat laboratory test allow ) ; history hypocalcemia metabolic disorder anticipate increase risk hypocalcemia ( e.g. , hypoparathyroidism ) ; concomitant use drug ( ) know potential cause hypocalcemia ( e.g. , aminoglycosides ) . Vitamin D deficiency , define 25 ( OH ) D level le 30 ng/mL , base central safety laboratory data obtain prior Visit 2 ( single repeat laboratory test allow ) . Participants vitamin D deficiency receive appropriate supplementation enrollment period . A normal vitamin D level ( great equal 30 ng/mL ) must document prior allocation investigational medicinal product ( IMP ) . Corrected QT interval ( accord Fridericia 's formula ; QTcF ) great 470 m ( average 3 electrocardiograms [ ECGs ] obtain Visit 1 ) ; serum potassium outside central laboratory 's reference range Visit 1 ; clinically unstable cardiac disease , include : unstable atrial fibrillation , symptomatic bradycardia , unstable congestive heart failure , active myocardial ischemia , indwell pacemaker ; evidence complete leave bundle branch block ; complete atrioventricular block ; history Long QT Syndrome relative condition ; know risk factor torsade de pointes . Participants receive medication know risk torsades de pointes within 7 day prior allocation . Participants receive selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant ( e.g. , citalopram , escitalopram ) tricyclic antidepressant eligible QTinterval value meet exclusion criterion , medication start least 1 month prior allocation , dose stable , dose anticipate remain stable least 4 day last infusion IMP . Anticipated requirement treatment oral intravenous bisphosphonate another condition osteoporosis trial , administration denosumab ( Prolia® ) drug affect bone turnover bone metabolism within 6 month prior Visit 1 . History allergic hypersensitivity reaction neridronic acid bisphosphonate , acetaminophen , vitamin D calcium supplement . Recent tooth extraction invasive dental procedure ( within 3 month prior Visit 1 ) , unhealed infect extraction site , significant dental/periodontal disease ( e.g. , impacted molar , severe tooth decay , foci infection ) may predispose need tooth extraction invasive dental procedure trial . Participants indeterminate , suspicious unreliable dental history , opinion investigator , must undergo dental examination prior receive treatment . Evidence denturerelated gum trauma improperly fit denture cause injury . Prior radiation therapy head neck ( within 1 year Visit 1 ) . History malignancy within 2 year prior Visit 1 , exception basal cell carcinoma . Use nerve block , ketamine infusion , intravenous immunoglobulin , acupuncture , electromagnetic field treatment , initiation/implementation radiofrequency ablation sympathectomy procedure , peripheral nerve stimulation within 6 week prior Visit 1 . Evidence current alcohol drug abuse , history alcohol drug abuse within 2 year Visit 1 , base participant history physical examination accord investigator 's judgment . Any severe medical condition , include severe depression , severe mood disorder , opinion investigator may affect efficacy safety assessment may compromise participant 's safety trial participation . Women pregnant breastfeeding . Elevated aspartate aminotransferase alanine aminotransferase great 2fold upper limit normal , base central safety laboratory data obtain Visit 1 , current evidence chronic liver disease . Safety laboratory testing may repeat prior Visit 2 , participant allow trial result 2 consecutive test , least 3 day apart , less equal 2fold upper limit normal . Participation another investigational drug trial within 3 month prior Visit 1 previous trial neridronic acid , exception participant KF701301 assign placebo receive neridronic acid . Participant engage litigation relate disability CRPS monetary gain loss ( compensation ) may affect objective participation trial .</criteria>
