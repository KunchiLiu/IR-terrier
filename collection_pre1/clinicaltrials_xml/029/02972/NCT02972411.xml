	<brief_title>Controlled Hyperventilation Prophylaxis Acute Mountain Sickness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Acute mountain sickness ( AMS ) common condition among people go altitude stay altitude . Acclimatization important mechanism order reduce risk AMS , however , possible adequate large part case . Recently , indication adjustment respiration mean voluntary increase respiratory minute volume similar prophylactic effect . The purpose study measure effect voluntary increase minute volume mean control hyperventilation prophylaxis acute mountain sickness without prior acclimatization , AMS express Lake Louise Self-Report Score ( LLSRS ) . Objective : To investigate safety efficacy voluntary increase minute ventilation mean control hyperventilation prophylaxis AMS , measure LLSRS randomize control trial ascend 4954m altitude . Study design : Prospective randomized control trial , safety efficacy . Study population : 30 healthy subject Intervention : The investigational prophylaxis control hyperventilation . Participants interventional group train hyperventilate control fashion series exercise 4 day prior ascent . They also teach practical way recognize early clinical sign symptom hypocapnia . Main study parameters/endpoints : Safety efficacy measure compare LLSRS two group . Target end-tidal CO2 ( PETCO2 ) measure objectify adequate hyperventilation . Symptoms hypocapnia due ( pre- ) intervention well adverse event report analysed .</detailed_description>
