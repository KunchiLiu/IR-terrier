	<brief_title>RadiatiOn Dose Among Different EndOvascular Procedures : RODEO Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The use fluoroscopically guide interventional procedure progressively increase past 20 years.Some previous report show radiation dose absorb interventional cardiologist great register medical staff expose X-rays . However recent year new procedure introduce validated set interventional cardiology radiology wide variation patient dose among different procedure . Radiation issue important issue patient operator due acute deterministic effect important long term stochastic risk cancer induction : however problem often under-evaluated . Even stochastic risk all-or-none phenomenon individual cell , great radiation exposure , cell injure . Moreover non cancerous effect possible cataract formation eye probability increase increase dose . Radiation dose express different way : Air Kerma amount energy absorb give mass air , whereas Dose Area Product ( DAP ) absorb dose radiation across give surface area . Generally DAP measurement accurate use Air Kerma measurement estimation patient radiation dose DAP allow variation field size . DAP consent good estimation dose irradiated tissue indicator patient cancer risk . Aim study evaluate radiation dose exposure different fluoroscopically guide interventional procedure compare different specialty ( electrophysiology , interventional radiology , interventional cardiology ) . Methods From January 2013 December 2015 diagnostic interventional procedure perform interventional operator include multicenter study without exclusion criterion . Collection data retrospective dedicate database . Radiation exposure assess measure DAP fluoroscopy time procedure . Moreover procedure center request give information operator , patient procedure detail . End point study The primary end-point study comparison DAP dose among interventional cardiologist , electrophysiologist interventional radiologist procedure . Secondary end-point study compare fluoroscopy time among different procedure .</detailed_description>
