	<brief_summary>Colorectal cancer fourth common cancer China . Up 30 % patient colorectal cancer present emergency obstruction large bowel time diagnosis , 70 % malignant obstruction occur left-sided colon . Patients obstruction associate bad oncologic outcome compare nonobstructive tumor . Conventionally , patient malignant large bowel obstruction receive emergency surgery , morbidity rate 30 % -60 % mortality rate 7-22 % , two-thirds patient end permanent stoma . Self-expanding metallic stent ( SEMS ) use bridge surgery ( relieve obstruction prior elective surgery ) patient potentially resectable colorectal cancer . Several clinical trial demonstrate SEMS bridge surgery may superior emergency surgery consider short-term outcome . SEMS associate low morbidity mortality rate , increase primary anastomosis rate , decrease stoma creation rate . Although half patient achieve primary anastomosis stent placement , primary anastomosis rate still significantly low compare nonobstructing elective surgery . The interval stent placement surgery may long enough bowel decompression insufficient time operation . Furthermore，the long-term oncologic result regard SEMS bridge surgery still limit contradictory . Sabbagh et al . suggest bad overall survival patient SEMS insertion compare emergency surgery , 5-year cancer-specific mortality significantly high SEMS group ( 48 % vs 21 % , respectively , P=0.02 ) . One interpretation tumor cell may disseminate procedure colonic stenting placement . We hypothesis immediate chemotherapy stenting may improve overall survival eradicate micrometastasis . Moreover , neoadjuvant chemotherapy prolongs interval stent placement surgery , time bowel decompression sufficient , may increase success rate primary anastomosis decrease risk stoma formation .</brief_summary>
