	<brief_title>ORthopaedic Trauma Anemia With Conservative Versus Liberal Transfusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Transfusion Orthopaedic trauma patient routinely do asymptomatic individual accept national standard recommendation American Academy Orthopaedic Surgeons Orthopaedic Trauma Association level anemia appropriate asymptomatic patient . Individual practitioner typically make decision base anecdotal experience expert opinion . No prospective study perform date answer question patient population . The null hypothesis propose pilot study difference see liberal transfusion strategy keep patient 's hemoglobin 7 g/dL versus conservative strategy keep patient 's hemoglobin 5.5 g/dL patient asymptomatic rest . The primary outcome pilot study infection ; define postoperative wound infection ( superficial deep ) perioperative infection surgical site ( urinary tract infection pneumonia ) . Deep infection define need intravenous antibiotic return surgery debridement . Superficial infection define use oral antibiotic successfully treat surgical site infection . Secondary outcome include pulmonary embolism , deep venous thrombosis , acute renal failure insufficiency , nonunion , delay union , compartment syndrome , osteomyelitis , nerve palsy , anoxic brain injury , cardiac ischemia infarct , pancreatitis , death , musculoskeletal functional assessment .</detailed_description>
