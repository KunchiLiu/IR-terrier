	<brief_summary>Chronic respiratory insufficiency patient advance disease late treatment depend mainly mechanical ventilation high intensity respiratory support therapy . Strengthen stability chronic respiratory insufficiency intervention reduce frequency extent acute disease , save medical resources.High-flow nasal cannula ( HFNC ) , new non-invasive oxygen therapy system , gradually become weapon respiratory support therapy . There little research role HFNC oxygen therapy chronic respiratory insufficiency . Our previous study find potential value HFNC chronic respiratory insufficiency . The aim project promote use HFNC reatment chronic respiratory insufficiency HFRS Shanghai first , second third grade hospital effort confirm HFNC improve prognosis patient chronic respiratory insufficiency compare nasal oxygen therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>High Flow Nasal Cannulae Oxygen Therapy Respiratory Insufficiency Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . To confirm HFNC use patient chronic respiratory insufficiency oxygen therapy general nasal catheter oxygen difference well . 2 . We set point research tertiary hospital , secondary hospital primary hospital explore different level HFNC application efficacy hospital difference well . To clarify promotion HFNC secondary hospital primary hospital mean . 3 . Patients chronic respiratory insufficiency require long-term oxygen therapy randomize randomize , control , multicentre clinical trial HFNC nasal oxygen therapy . Analysis comparison HFNC general nasal catheter oxygen treatment chronic respiratory insufficiency difference , HFNC different grade hospital use consistent . 4 . Research method : 4.1 Subjects : Chronic respiratory insufficiency require long-term oxygen therapy Shanghai Tenth People 's Hospital multi-center hospital patient . 4.2 Study sample size : 100 sample collect three test center . Of 150 case nasal oxygen therapy , HFNC 150 case .</detailed_description>
