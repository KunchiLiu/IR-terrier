	<brief_title>Investigation Trunk Neuromuscular Control Patients With Non-specific Low Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study use sample convenience age 21 - 65 . Patients non-specific low back pain ( NSLBP ) recruit advertisement 2 Mahidol university physical therapy clinic participate clinic hospital . Asymptomatic participant also recruit flyer post 2 Mahidol university physical therapy clinic . Based upon power analysis change kinematic pattern patient NSLBP 8-week core stabilization exercise program , total required sample size 29 patient NSLBP detect medium effect size ( Cohen 's ) .48 level ( α ) .05 power ( 1-β ) .80 . Fifteen percent drop-out rate use conservative sample size calculation . Therefore , 34 patient NSLBP ( 29 X 15 % drop-out ) 34 age- , sex- , BMI-matched asymptomatic participant include independent intervention study ( core stabilization exercise approach , movement system impairment approach , neuromuscular activation use suspension , kinematic linkage imbalance approach ) . Each intervention separately collect analyze . The total 272 participant recruit fulfill study project ( 4 independent intervention study ) . However , sample size asymptomatic participant decrease participant one intervention study match patient NSLBP intervention study . Patients NSLBP interested participation undergo screen process use inclusion-exclusion criterion checklist receive brief information regard study . If meet inclusion criterion , consent process biomechanical testing schedule . On date consent biomechanical testing , asymptomatic participant participant NSLBP provide consent form . To ensure understand study , simply ask regard study ( i.e . objective , benefit , etc . ) sign consent form . After participant provide write informed consent , undergo standardized physical therapy examination perform experienced physical therapist ( PT-A ) . For patient NSLBP , also complete 3 clinical outcome measure include 1 ) numeric pain rating scale ( Thai version ) , 2 ) Oswestry disability index ( Thai version ) , 3 ) general health status questionnaire ( Thai version ) . This pre-biomechanical data collection process last approximately 60 minute . For biomechanical testing , body landmark identify marked skin pen 4 motion sensor 16 pair surface electromyography ( EMG ) electrodes low back abdominal area . Any hair area around sensor electrodes shave . Before place surface EMG electrodes , skin lightly abrade use abrasive paper clean use cotton alcohol lower skin impedance . Electrodes align parallel muscle fiber . This process take approximately 30 minute . Then , participant proceed biomechanical test include 1 ) trunk muscle strength test , 2 ) functional trunk pelvic movement test , 3 ) core control task . Trunk muscle strength test Strength test Participants wear climb harness connect tension load cell sit test apparatus neutral trunk position pelvic securely lock . This apparatus intend reduce compensation low extremity sub-maximal ( 15 % body weight ) maximal voluntary isometric contraction . Participants instruct use trunk gradually pull load cell ( isometric contraction neutral trunk position ) 10 second forward , backward , 2 side bending direction . Participants give 2 practice trial direction adjust force reduce learn effect . Visual feedback force sub-maximal target provide . Two trial sub-maximal voluntary isometric contraction collect direction . Only 1 trial maximal voluntary isometric contraction collect avoid muscle fatigue ( asymptomatic participant patient NSLBP ) pain exacerbation ( patient NSLBP ) . The intention collect maximal contraction data use EMG standardization . Participants rest trial minimize fatigue . Pain rating perceive exertion ( RPE ) monitor recorded end trunk strength test . This protocol take approximately 15 minute . Functional trunk pelvic movement test Participants stand draw paper foot shoulder width apart front motion transmitter . The foot print drawn use marker . This foot print use post-test positioning . The participant stand natural stance face away transmitter arm side . Participants instruct stand straight maintain position digitization . After completion digitization , participant instruct perform functional movement include 1 ) active forward bend return upright position , 2 ) right leave straight leg raise test , 3 ) right leave hip abduction knee flexion test , 4 ) quadruped backward rock test , 5 ) prone right leave knee flexion test , 6 ) prone right leave hip internal/external rotation test , 7 ) prone right leave hip extension test . Participants perform 2 trial 3 consecutive repetition functional movement test . Two physical therapist ( PT-B PT-C ) , blind group membership , simultaneously observe independently rate aberrant movement pattern biomechanical data collection . This protocol take approximately 30 minute . Core control task Participants sit unstable chair foot support . The chair mount half ball make chair unstable tilt . Participants instructed balance chair without tip chair direction . The participant maintain upright seat balance cross arm front chest . The participant opportunity get familiar balance test protocol prior data collection minimize learn effect . This core control task aim investigate performance represent static dynamic stability trunk . For static stability , participant perform 3 trial 60-second seated balance test eye open , 3 trial 60-second seated balance test eye close . The participant give 1-minute rest period trial avoid muscle fatigue . For dynamic stability , participant instruct perform dynamic stability use lumbar spine ( without trunk lean tilt unstable chair far ) 8 different direction ( forward , backward , right , leave , right diagonal , leave diagonal ) . The participant give 1 practice trial reduce possibility learn effect , 3 real trial 1-minute rest period trial . Pain RPE record completion core control task . This protocol take approximately 30 minute . Patients NSLBP assign one different physical therapy intervention accord participate clinic hospital , asymptomatic participant encourage maintain usual daily activity avoid participate activity involve trunk muscle exercise . After completion 8-week physical therapy intervention , asymptomatic participant patient NSLBP undergo standardize physical therapy examination biomechanical data collection . For patient NSLBP , also complete clinical outcome measure post physical therapy intervention . Physical therapy intervention Patients NSLBP treat standard physical therapy intervention base upon different treatment concept . In general , intervention include strengthen exercise , endurance exercise , stretch exercise , patient education , patient ergonomics , home exercise program . There reported adverse effect physical therapy intervention . Therefore , physical therapy intervention safe treat patient NSLBP . Each patient treat 1-2 time per week 60 minute session 8 week experience physical therapist . Patients give home exercise log exercise compliance . All Statistical analysis perform use statistical package social science ( SPSS ) software ( IBM SPSS Statistics Windows , Version 21.0. , New York , USA ) . Study objective 1 determine inter-rater reliability diagnostic accuracy clinical observation aberrant movement pattern functional trunk pelvic movement patient NSLBP . Agreement presence/absence aberrant movement pattern physical therapist ( PT-B PT-C ) determine use separate kappa statistic . Diagnostic accuracy determine use accuracy statistic include sensitivity , specificity , likelihood ratio . Significance level hold .05 analysis . Confidence interval also calculate . Study objective 2 characterize neuromuscular control asymptomatic participant patient NSLBP functional activity . Each variable analyze separately . Descriptive statistic ( i.e . mean standard deviation ) perform statistical assumption ( i.e . normal distribution , homogeneity variance , etc . ) relate specific statistical test perform . Statistical transformation perform appropriate . Then , statistical test ( i.e . independent t-test , Mann-Whitney U-test , etc . ) appropriate data perform determine difference asymptomatic participant patient NSLBP . Significance level hold .05 analysis . Post-hoc power analysis also perform determine statistical power effect size . Study objective 3 determine appropriate physical therapy intervention address neuromuscular control deficits patient NSLBP . First , effect physical therapy intervention trunk neuromuscular control clinical outcome determine . Prior utilization statistical test , descriptive statistic perform statistical assumption test . Transformation perform data normally distribute . Appropriate statistical test perform determine effect physical therapy intervention neuromuscular control clinical outcome . Significance level hold .05 analysis . Post-hoc power analysis perform . In addition , study objective determine ability physical therapy intervention matched- unmatched-intervention patient base upon intervention criterion . Each patient NSLBP classify base upon clinical criterion physical therapy intervention . Pre-post difference match unmatched group compare use appropriate statistical test . Significance level hold .05 analysis . Post-hoc power analysis also perform .</detailed_description>
