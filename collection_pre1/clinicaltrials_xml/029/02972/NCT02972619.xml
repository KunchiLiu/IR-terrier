	<brief_summary>Background : Hypertension serious public health problem responsible significant mortality morbidity cardiovascular disease . In Singapore , 1 4 adult age 30 year old suffer hypertension . Nearly half patient uncontrolled hypertension 50 % individual antihypertensive treatment . Our study aim evaluate effectiveness , cost effectiveness impact medication adherence well-structured program use multicomponent intervention hypertension control aim overall cardiovascular risk reduction among individual hypertension attend polyclinics Singapore , compare exist service . Such program expect cost-effective term improve hypertensive individual ' outcome , potentially scalable sustainable . Methods/design : Cluster randomize trial 8 nine SingHealth Polyclinics randomize intervention usual care ( 4 ) follow 2 year post randomization Intervention : The structured multicomponent primary care program comprises : 1 ) algorithm-driven antihypertensive treatment hypertensive individual use fixed-dose combination ( FDC ) lipid-lowering medication high-risk hypertensive individual , 2 ) motivational conversation high-risk hypertensive individual , 3 ) Follow-up hypertensive individual improve blood pressure ( BP ) primary outcome cardiovascular risk factor secondary outcome , 4 ) discount FDC antihypertensive medication Usual care : The participant attend polyclinics randomize usual care continue receive treatment health provider accord exist practice . The hypertensive individual also continue pay service ( physician nurse consultation ) per exist model reimbursement . Participants : A total 1000 participant recruit , 125 8 polyclinics . Recruitment batch 4 4 clinic sequentially ( balanced randomization group ) . Outcomes : All hypertensive individual assess trained outcome assessor independent treatment baseline , 1-year 2-yeat post randomization . The primary outcome change systolic blood pressure baseline 2 year . Primary Cost-Effectiveness measure be- 1 ) Incremental cost per mm Hg systolic BP reduction baseline end follow-up two year post randomization ; 2 ) incremental cost per project CVD disability adjust life year ( DALYs ) avert quality adjust life year ( QALYs ) save , 3 ) incremental cost per change cardiovascular risk score baseline final follow-up two-year post . The impact effect adherence antihypertensive lipid medication measure use data adherence obtain polyclinic pharmacy record clinic note . An average percent adherence antihypertensive lipid lowering compute composite score . The change percent composite adherence antihypertensive lipid medication baseline follow compare intervention control group .</brief_summary>
