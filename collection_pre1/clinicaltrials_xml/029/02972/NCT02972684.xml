	<brief_summary>Peri operative haemorrhage follow cardio Pulmonary Bypass may occur 5 10 % cardiac surgical intervention . Treatment complication often necessitate various combination therapeutic intervention include allogenic blood product administration , drug use and/or surgical intervention . All expensive treatment decision making guide patient clinical status biological test haemostatic function . A key point time frame clinical process . Therapeutic choice do fast possible minimize bleeding consequence patient haemodynamic physiological status . Conventional coagulation test result availability time usually exceed 45 ' blood draw . In situation , result may reflect precisely coagulation system current state . This downside often counterbalance clinician empirical choice precede lab test result knowledge may conduct inappropriate treatment , blood product overuse undue expense . Viscoelastic point care test may compensate limitation conventional coagulation test . In perioperative haemorrhage , faster precise information haemostatic function may help accurate therapeutic choice . The IMOTEC study aim compare haemorrhage management follow cardiac surgery use conventional blood coagulation test thrombo-elastogaphic point care test . Primary endpoint cost utility analysis technology secondary endpoint include blood component transfusion , postoperative bleeding , thoracic re-intervention , postoperative infection ( cause ) , organ failure , hospital length stay death .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The research real life , prospective , single blind stepped wedge randomize study . Inclusion inform consent adult patient cardio-vascular surgical procedure use cardiopulmonary bypass meeting inclusion criterion `` bleeding '' . After meet inclusion criterion patient manage either use conventional blood coagulation test use thrombo-elastometry POC test predefined therapeutic intervention describe specific algorithm . Other element patient clinical management follow usual center standard care . Follow EQ-5D clinical evaluation perform one , 6 12 month inclusion .</detailed_description>

Patient inform write consent ( nonopposition data use ) person trust family member information . Blood Coagulation test sample indication intra postoperative bleeding define follow : 1. intraoperative post CPB bleeding ; evaluation 10min heparin reversal protamin . Clinically significant bleed judge surgeon anesthesiologist consensual point view Sternal closure delay Chest tube bleed exceed 50ml 10min 1ml/kg 30min ( 2ml/kg/h ) 2 . Postoperative period , evaluation post operative care environment 30min stabilization period Chest tube bleed exceed 50ml 10min 1ml/kg 30min ( 2ml/kg/h ) Patient require surgical reexploration diagnose suspect pericardial effusion surgical site bleed require surgical hemostatic intervention Known congenital bleed disorder Redo surgery patient previously include study Implantation Cardiac support device , Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation ( ECMO ) Extra Corporeal Life support ( ECLS ) , uni biventricular artificial heart . Indication postCPB ECMO ECLS blood transfusion refusal pregnant woman patient 18 year old Adult patient guardianship , trusteeship safeguard justice</criteria>
