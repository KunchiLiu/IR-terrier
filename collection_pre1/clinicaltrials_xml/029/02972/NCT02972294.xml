	<detailed_description>Fractures upper end femur , call commonly `` Hip fracture '' common , incidence approximately 1.6 million case per year worldwide . This high incidence anticipate grow rapidly next decade , drive population age . Anemia frequent admission hip fracture , concern 45 % patient , mean hemoglobin level 12.5±0.2 g/dl . This high prevalence anemia together blood loss , secondary fracture surgery responsible high rate blood transfusion ( approximately 40-50 % patient ) .

There therefore need treat anemia and/or prevent decrease hemoglobin . For purpose , intravenous iron propose . Some non-randomized , mainly retrospective , study show perioperative intravenous iron able reduce blood transfusion ( i.e . number patient transfused number unit per patient ) . Indeed , pool analysis 5 study include 1,361 patient suggest intravenous iron could reduce perioperative transfusion hip fracture patient . However , definitive data . Another way reduce blood transfusion would reduce perioperative bleeding . Tranexamic acid proven efficient purpose trauma patient elective surgery patient . However , two randomized study investigate interest tranexamic acid hip fracture , conclusive probably owe lack power . In addition , use intravenous tranexamic acid could limit population frail patient topical use tranexamic acid , notably prevent intraoperative bleeding , appear accurate sure alternative . Although hip fracture frequent pathology , high burden care , data available focus management perioperative anemia context . The interest perioperative blood management recently increase thanks well recognition adverse effect blood transfusion , good understand iron metabolism , new intravenous iron drug renew interest former medication ( i.e . tranexamic acid ) . hiFIT study therefore propose 2X2 factorial design study order answer question vis-à-vis interest iron tranexamic acid reduce blood transfusion hip fracture patient .</detailed_description>
