	<brief_summary>The investigator research study find blood flow change lungs people pulmonary hypertension treatment ambrisentan ( sell brand name Letairis ) . The investigator hope know difference help u good understand pulmonary hypertension find new way diagnose early .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>FDG Uptake Lung Blood Flow PAH Before After Treatment With Ambrisentan</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overall goal study evaluate lung , large vessel , right ventricular glucose uptake rate use 18FDG PET distribution pulmonary perfusion use 13NN PET patient pulmonary hypertension treatment ambrisentan . The investigator propose pilot study patient Group I PAH . The investigator plan complete pilot study 5 patient ( project enrollment 8 allow drop-out rate ) . Taken together , study demonstrate FDG-PET use detect change associate PAH , monitor response therapy . FDG-PET widely available technology , firmly establish field clinical oncology . Ambrisentan endothelin receptor antagonist FDA-approved treat patient pulmonary arterial hypertension . Patients eligible participation study already make decision start treatment ambrisentan pulmonary hypertension . The investigator propose physiologic study patient already make decision start ambrisentan therapy . Participation study alter affect participant decision regard treatment . Prior human study evaluate response PH-specific therapy focus right ventricle . Oikawa et al . look RV uptake patient PH evaluate treatment epoprostenol . Fang colleague use FDG-SPECT evaluate FDG uptake RV patient IPAH PH treatment sildenafil . Both study use SUV ( specific uptake variable ) . The investigator propose focus lung RV uptake rate ( Ki ) order provide robust analysis metabolic change underlie development pulmonary hypertension right ventricle lung parenchyma , study response ambrisentan FDG-PET .</detailed_description>
