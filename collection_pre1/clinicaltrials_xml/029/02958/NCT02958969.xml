	<brief_summary>Patients live multiple myeloma ( MM ) increase risk venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) due disease use target therapy , include immunomodulatory drug ( IMiDs ) . Prevention VTE become major management challenge MM treatment . There paucity data respect non-vitamin K oral anticoagulant ( NOACs ) cancer population . However , NOACs offer comparable efficacy improve safety compare warfarin . Apixaban show excellent safety efficacy treatment prevention recurrent VTE ( 1,2 ) . The safety efficacy apixaban primary prevention VTE MM patient establish . Aim # 1 : To quantify 6-month rate major clinically relevant non-major bleeding MM patient receive IMiDs prescribe apixaban 2.5 mg orally twice daily primary prevention VTE . Hypothesis # 1 : The 6-month rate major clinically relevant non-major bleeding MM patient receive IMiDs prescribe apixaban 2.5 mg orally twice daily primary prevention VTE ≤3 % ( 2 ) . Although MM population , general , high medical acuity previous large randomize controlled trial apixaban , select stable population MM patient appropriate immunomodulatory therapy . Aim # 2 : To quantify 6-month rate symptomatic VTE MM patient receive IMiDs prescribe apixaban 2.5 mg orally twice daily primary prevention VTE . Hypothesis # 2 : The 6-month rate symptomatic VTE MM patient receive IMiDs prescribe apixaban 2.5 mg orally twice daily primary prevention VTE &lt; 7 % ( 3 ) . Although additional therapy MM dexamethasone erythropoietin-stimulating agent may increase risk VTE , rate incident VTE reduce &lt; 7 % apixaban .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>MM associate increase risk venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) . The use target therapy , include immunomodulatory drug ( IMiDs ) , improve outcome patient MM also increase risk VTE . Prevention VTE become major management dilemma MM treatment . There paucity data respect non-vitamin K oral anticoagulant ( NOACs ) cancer population , include patient MM . However , NOACs show offer comparable efficacy improve safety compare warfarin . Apixaban show excellent safety efficacy treatment prevention recurrent VTE ( 1,2 ) . Compared injectable thromboprophylactic regimen enoxaparin , apixaban offer advantage orally administer less reliant renal clearance . The safety efficacy apixaban primary prevention VTE MM patient establish . The current study evaluate apixaban ( 2.5 mg twice daily ) patient population without history prior VTE . Although current study population high risk VTE , likely low risk VTE prior randomize controlled trial apixaban secondary prevention . Furthermore , current practice provide MM patient receive IMiDs prophylactic dos ( treatment dos ) low-molecular weight heparin ( enoxaparin 40 mg inject daily ) . Accordingly , rationale test apixaban ( 2.5 mg twice daily ) consistent standard practice prophylactic anticoagulation . The current study provide event rate inform design large randomize control trial . If safe effective , apixaban satisfy critical unmet need represent substantial advance `` game changer '' prevention VTE high risk patient population .</detailed_description>
