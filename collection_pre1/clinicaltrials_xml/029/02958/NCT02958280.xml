	<brief_title>A Tailored Physical Activity Smartphone App Patients With Alcohol Dependence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Alcohol Use Disorders ( AUDs ) highly prevalent costly public health problem . AUDs third lead preventable cause death U.S. associate significant negative physical psychological health consequence , cost U.S. economy estimate $ 235 billion dollar per year . While progress occur develop treatment AUDs , relapse rate still extremely high , range 60-95 % first year follow treatment . Given compel evidence benefit increase physical activity physical health , psychological functioning , drink outcome , effort help patient AUDs adopt sustain increase level physical activity ( PA ) likely result significant public health impact . Capitalizing advantage scalability dissemination afford use technology , investigator develop smartphone-based physical activity application ( app ) , call Fit &amp; Sober , tailor specifically patient AUDs . Although number PA apps exist , majority suffer lack theory-based concept know influence behavior change . Grounded Self Determination Theory ( SDT ) Social Cognitive Theory ( SCT ) , investigator develop tailor Fit &amp; Sober app patient AUDs design feature help patient develop intrinsic , value-driven goal ( e.g. , exercise benefit relate sobriety ) focus increase saliency immediate reward associate PA ( e.g. , decrease alcohol urge improve affect ) . The investigator propose someone exercise make difference long-term PA . Early recovery AUDs , negative affect risk relapse urge drink common , may opportune time help patient develop internalize , self-determined motivation experientially make connection exercise acute improvement affect craving . Smartphone technology offer unique advantage self-monitoring change affect craving relation physical activity . The aim propose study include : 1 . Study Phase 1 ( App Development ) : A Mixed-methods approach use develop tailor , theoretically-driven smartphone intervention ( Fit &amp; Sober App ) help patient early recovery AUDs increase level physical activity . 1. . The principle agile software development use create prototype app . Feedback obtain series usability study focus group patient AUDs iteratively inform subsequent version app . 2 . Study Phase 2 ( Open Pilot ) : To conduct open pilot trial 20 patient AUDs early recovery determine feasibility , acceptability , short-term increase PA use Fit &amp; Sober app . After 12-weeks app use : 2.a . Through self-report measure qualitative interview , feedback obtain use Fit &amp; Sober app well satisfaction app , strengths weakness app , challenge encounter app , suggestion area improvement , adverse event . 2.b . Through examination Fit &amp; Sober metadata , indicator extent app usage ( e.g. , day utilize , time spent application , component access , etc . ) obtain . 2.c . Through objectively measure PA , short-term increase physical activity level examine .</detailed_description>
