	<detailed_description>X healthy volunteer , amateur football team , X football player previous history hamstring injury orthopaedic clinic , comprise subject study . Hamstring muscle injury define `` traumatic distraction overuse injury hamstring muscle lead player unable fully participate training match play '' . The Control Group ( CG ) healthy , neither surgery/trauma low extremity , history hamstring injury , abnormal finding physical examination . The exclusion criterion include participant : ( 1 ) metal implant pace maker , ( 2 ) weight 200 kg ( MRI table limitation ) , ( 3 ) unable complete test . In Injured Group , patient also exclude previous injury originate non-muscular source ( e.g. , inguinal femoral hernia , nerve entrapment , lumbosacral pathology ) , still symptom , return practice participate track field since last injury . The Study Group ( SG ) history diagnosis hamstring injury assessment diagnosis image technique ( ultrasound MRI ) , least 2 next criterion : 1 . When injury happen disability practise team least one week ; 2 . Lost least one match ; 3 . Felt pain try kick ball run fast ; 4 . Receive specific treatment ( medical physiotherapy ) injury ; 5 . Needed period plan return play . Participants screen contraindication MRI ultrasound assessment MRI scan hamstring muscle legs perform . MRI perform within 24 h ultrasound scan . The subject instruct consume alcohol perform moderate heavy exercise 24 hour prior image session . Muscle thickness define distance bone-muscle interface adipose tissue-muscle interface . The measurement make superficial edge bright line represent interface bony cortex muscle superficial edge bright line represent interface outer fascial layer muscle subcutaneous adipose tissue . When bone contact muscle two fascial layer use .</detailed_description>
