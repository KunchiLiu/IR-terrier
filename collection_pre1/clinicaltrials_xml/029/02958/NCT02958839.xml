	<brief_title>Relationship Between Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 Recurrence Atrial Fibrillation After Catheter Ablation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atrial fibrillation , result stroke thromboembolism approximately 5-fold increase risk , great burden health care system age population . Catheter ablation promise treatment atrial fibrillation . However , recurrence rate AF catheter ablation high , range 20 % -60 % . Therefore , non-invasive predictor AF recurrence catheter ablation necessary select optimal patient procedure . Fibroblast growth factor-23 ( FGF-23 ) bone-derived hormone play central role phosphate homeostasis . Recent study show fibroblast growth factor 23 play important role cardiac remodel consider independently associate occurrence atrial fibrillation . In study , go observe relationship serum FGF-23 arrythmia recurrence catheter ablation AF . This research go recruit 200 consecutive patient history atrial fibrillation 180-360 day intend undergo catheter ablation . The day catheter ablation , serum FGF-23 level detect . Echocardiogram leave atrial CT scan also perform day catheter ablation . All patient routinely follow outpatient department cardiologist every month 1 year . If patient complain palpitation , fatigue , symptom related arrhythmia , Holter monitoring perform . Patients also advise see doctor anytime symptom undergo 12-lead ECG examination 24-hour Holter monitoring . In asymptomatic patient , 24-hour Holter monitoring 7-day cardiac event record perform every three month procedure . The endpoint follow-up recurrence atrial fibrillation , consider episode AF/AFL/AT blank period 3 month procedure catheter ablation . Those develop recurrence AF follow assign recurrence group , develop recurrence AF follow assign non-recurrence group . Comparison serum FGF-23 level two group carry order investigate relationship serum FGF-23 level recurrence AF .</detailed_description>
