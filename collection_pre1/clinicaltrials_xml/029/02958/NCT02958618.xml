	<brief_summary>Limited endoscopic sphincterotomy balloon dilation（ESBD）is promising technique treat common bile duct stone . It similar success rate stone extraction , incidence complication remain uncertain . However , clinical evidence guideline define optimal duration balloon dilation far . So designed prospective randomize trial compare effect three different duration balloon dilation ESBD find optimal duration balloon dilation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Different Duration Bolloon Dilation During ESBD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Common Bile duct stone one common diseases present incidence 0.5 % -3 % China . Endoscopic sphincterotomy ( EST ) frequently use endoscopic technique clearance stone since first description 1974 . Although EST minimally invasive , bring postoperative complication bleed , perforation acute pancreatitis . The overall complication mortality 11.7-23 % 0.5 % , respectively . Moreover , believe EST cause permanent sphincter Oddi（SO） dysfunction result biliary infection , stone recurrence malignancy . As alternative method EST , Endoscopic papillary balloon dilation ( EPBD ) describe Staritz et al management CBD stone . EPBD preserve SO function avoid undesirable effect due incompetent sphincter . It report basic SO function restore one month EPBD . Nonetheless , EPBD indicate stone small 12mm diameter biliary orifice enlarge lesser extent compare EST . Furthermore , incidence postoperative pancreatitis reach 15-30 % . These disadvantage limit application EPBD . As result , Ersoz et al start combine technique 2003 , call Endoscopic sphincterotomy balloon dilation（ESBD） . ESBD preserve SO function , reduce adverse event , increase stone removal rate . Especially , applied stone large 12mm diameter large balloon dilatation . When ESBD perform , duration dilation one important factor affect postoperative complication . Whereas , issue regard technique need evaluation , optimal duration EPBD EST . Some believe short-term dilation achieve desire result duration balloon dilation significantly correlate postoperative pancreatitis , opponent believe although small sphincterotomy perform , short-term dilation able fully relax residual sphincter . For long-term complication ESBD , include incidence cholangitis , biliary stone recurrence rate , incidence biliary stenosis , relative report either . This prospective , randomize , control trial design compare difference efficacy morbidity among three different duration balloon dilation（30s，60s，180s） endoscopic sphincterotomy treatment common bile duct stone . We hope helpful establish reasonable operation guideline ESBD .</detailed_description>
