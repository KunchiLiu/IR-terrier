	<brief_summary>Previous study suggest consumer choose eat could find food pleasant , consume food , absence choice . However cognitive mechanism could explain effect choice investigate . The study consist fMRI experiment intend observe effect presence choice brain activity follow consumption fruit-flavored drink , compare brain activity drink consume without choice . It suggest consumer appreciate drink choose well , activity gustatory reward region change accordingly change declare food pleasure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Choice Food Pleasure Using fMRI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study include one inclusion session ( S1 ) , one out-of-the-magnet tasting session ( S2 ) , one fMRI session ( S3 ) . For session , study drink use fruit-flavored drink fruit juice available French market . All subject undergo protocol , except choice three study drink do individually . S1 . After inclusion/exclusion criterion verify , subject perform test verify gustatory/olfactory function ( four basic taste test ETOC test ) . They taste study drink , blindly , rate perceive pleasantness . S2 . The out-of-the-magnet tasting session include three part : S2.1 - familiarization study procedure . Subjects place condition mimic fMRI session : ask lie supine position , head place false head coil , gustometer fix mouth video screen visible deliver instruction ( visual paradigm create use E-Prime ) . They also give roll wheel collect feedback . The rest session spend position . Subjects taste whole range study drink ( drink twice , randomized order ) rate pleasantness visual analog scale ( VAS ) . S2.2 . - learn picture-drink association . Three drink choose base rating give first part session ( three equally appreciate , well-liked ( VAS score &gt; 50 ) drink ) . Subjects taste three drink repeatedly observe abstract picture . The objective sequence learn 3 picture-drink pair . S2.3 - associative learning verification . Subjects taste three drink choose picture drink associate . If fail , S2.2 S2.3 sequence repeat . If fail learn association second verification , exclude form study . S3 . The fMRI session 's objective study cognitive correlate choice . Subjects place 3Tesla fMRI scanner , gustometer , visual screen roll wheel available S2 . The functional fMRI scan do use high-resolution protocol ( 1,5*1,5*1,8mm ) cover prefrontal , subcortical occipital brain area . Subjects undergo 80 tasting . In 50 % tasting , view three previously learn picture freely choose one , receive 1ml drink associate picture . In 50 % tasting , picture-drink pair receive without possibility choose . The `` choice '' tasting compute accord result `` choice '' tasting drink consume amount time `` choice '' `` choice '' context .</detailed_description>
