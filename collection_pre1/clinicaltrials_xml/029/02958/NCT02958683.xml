	<brief_summary>Breathing movement , call chest wall motion , complex . The investigator study movement abdomen , rib diaphragm contribute breathe differs different disease chest . Breathing movement may help diagnosis , assessment severity assess impact treatment chest condition . The investigator follow people chest disease , measure chest wall motion compare diagnosis treatment work . Chest wall motion measure different way rest whilst exercise . Small sticker chest use reflect infra red light visible square light shone onto chest without use sticker .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Optoelectronic plethysmography ( OEP ) base analysis breathe trajectory series marker position thoracic-abdominal surface patient . The position space marker record processed mathematical model algorithm compute unit accurately measure volume variation whole thoracic-abdominal wall , also variations various compartment . This detect , example , asymmetries action respiratory muscle . The system accurately measure current volume , vital capacity , respiratory frequency , duration phase inspiration exhalation , average inspiration exhalation flux volume variation end exhalation . Structured Light Plethysmography ( SLP ) also assess regional chest wall excursion require marker place patient . The system use visible light shone onto chest wall checkerboard pattern reflect back patient 's skin tight T shirt . Images 4 Microsoft Kinnect Motion Cameras use create 3D representation patient 's torso . This system show correlate well chest wall measurement record OEP . These system innovative examination instrument , non-invasive , accurate , easy use unlike traditional plethysmographic technology , affect humidity temperature variation easily use perform measurement extend period time . They accurately measure dynamic volume variation occur breathe various section thoracic-abdominal wall ( upper , low abdominal thoracic area ) . This data , otherwise undetectable , useful contribution evaluation patient . We apply chest wall motion analysis understand physiology thoracic disease process well assess potential diagnostic prognostic ( response treatment ) marker could use future clinical practice .</detailed_description>
