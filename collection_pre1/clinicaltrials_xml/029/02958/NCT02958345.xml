	<brief_summary>Study Design : Double-blinded , placebo control study efficacy Zostavax cirrhosis . Subjects receive either Zostavax placebo follow four month . Hypothesis : The investigator hypothesize Zostavax would induce cell-based immunity cirrhotic patient like see elderly patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Placebo Controlled Evaluation Cell Mediated Immune Response Cirrhotic Subjects Zostavax™</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study aim , background , design Herpes Zoster ( Shingles ) major cause pain expense elderly chronically ill . The incidence estimate 3 1,000 patient . Zostavax™ high dose , live varicella vaccine validate large placebo control trial reduce incidence Herpes Zoster rash post herpetic neuralgia patient 50 year age . Additionally vaccine show increase quality life patient . Symptomatic Herpes Zoster rate particularly high post liver transplant 3- , 5- , 10-year actuarial rate Herpes Zoster 3 % , 10 % , 14 % , 18 % , respectively . Zostavax currently recommend patient prior solid organ transplantation adult data liver transplant candidate support practice . And Although cirrhosis acknowledge risk factor symptomatic Herpes Zoster , publish data efficacy Zostavax chronically ill cirrhotic adult pre-transplantation . In particular , know whether chronically ill cirrhotic patient demonstrate appropriate age relate cell-mediated immune response see original Zostavax trial . Procedure The study divide 3 part : Screening , Day 1 ( administration study drug ) , Follow Up . There 4 week screening period . The following procedure occur Screening : Sign consent History physical exam Inclusion exclusion review Collection concomitant medication The screen visit may occur day Day 1 visit . The following procedure occur Day 1 : Confirm eligibility Predose lab collection : Interferon-G Enzyme-Linked Immunospot Assay ( ELISPOT ) , GPELISA , VZV Glycoprotein Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay ( also know Varicella Zoster antibody titre ) , Urine pregnancy test woman childbearing potential Randomize subject Administer study drug - either Zostavax vaccine placebo Follow Up Period : Month 1 - phone call collection adverse event ( AEs ) concomitant medication 6 week visit - post dose lab collection : Interferon-G Enzyme-Linked Immunospot Assay ( ELISPOT ) GPELISA , VZV Glycoprotein Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay ( also know Varicella Zoster antibody titre ) Months 2 , 3 4 - phone call collection AEs concomitant medication Laboratory Tests : The Zoster antibody titer run Tulane Medical Center Lab result Meditech . The cell mediate immune response lab ( ELISPOT ) standard lab Tulane Medical Center . This run Tulane Medical School research scientist , whose personal lab capability special assay . Telephone Calls : After injection , subject follow Investigator clinically indicate . A study team member call subject month 4 month . A standardized approach use every subject . The subject ask concomitant medication adverse event rash , fever , hospitalization , injection site reaction , sign hepatic decompensation include ascites , confusion , bleeding , physician office visit . After subject complete assay result , study unblinded . The subject receive placebo offer Zostavax vaccine cost offer chance go Follow Up Period described . The placebo subject participate Follow Up Period receive Zostavax vaccine . The subject opt receive vaccine receive vaccine receive vaccine give blood day 1 6 week also option get monthly call 4 month . Labs : Pre-vaccination 6 week post-vaccination measure varicella immune response Interferon-G Enzyme-Linked Immunospot Assay ( ELISPOT ) - perform Tulane Medical School Laboratory . GPELISA , VZV Glycoprotein Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay ( Varicella Zoster antibody titre ) - perform Tulane Medical Center Laboratory . There approximately 20 cc blood drawn per lab collection . Total volume blood drawn study 40cc . Four month post dose monitoring : telephone contact occur month 4 month monitor adverse event concomitant medication . All placebo subject offer complimentary Zostavax vaccine study close un-blinded . See detailed explanation Procedure . Randomization : Thirty subject randomize via seal envelope system either vaccine placebo . Fifteen envelop Zostavax designation fifteen envelop placebo designation . The subject choose one seal envelope treatment . The sealed envelope take pharmacist open envelope dispense treatment indicate . Only pharmacist unblinded treatment . Adverse event : Adverse Events collect Day 1 end subject 's participation . Events interest list . Clinical Herpes Zoster Injection site reaction Hospitalization ( cause ) Hepatic decompensation-new onset ascites , encephalopathy , portal hypertensive bleed new hepatocellular carcinoma Death Should subject injury health problem due take part study , subject subject 's insurance responsible cost . The investigator expect hospitalization complication require intervention . Treatment clinical Herpes Zoster infection : All subject develop clinical diagnosis Herpes Zoster study treat anti-virals indicated appropriate pain relief need . The subject subject 's insurance responsible cost . Risks : There risk associate every drug study . The investigator suspect subject place increase risk . Zostavax : Zostavax consider safe , possible side effect , contraindication warnings/precautions . The following listed Zostavax Package Insert : Adverse Reactions The frequent adverse reaction , report ≥1 % subject vaccinate Zostavax , headache injection-site reaction . Contraindications Hypersensitivity - Zostavax administered individual history anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reaction gelatin , neomycin component vaccine . Immunosuppression - Zostavax live , attenuate varicella-zoster vaccine administration may result disseminated disease individual immunosuppressed immunodeficient . Zostavax administer immunosuppressed immunodeficient individual include history primary acquire immunodeficiency state , leukemia , lymphoma malignant neoplasm affect bone marrow lymphatic system , AIDS clinical manifestation infection human immunodeficiency virus , immunosuppressive therapy . Pregnancy - Zostavax administer pregnant woman . It know whether Zostavax cause fetal harm administer pregnant woman affect reproduction capacity . However , naturally occur VZV infection know sometimes cause fetal harm . Therefore , Zostavax administer pregnant woman , pregnancy avoid 3 month follow administration Zostavax . Warnings Precautions Hypersensitivity Reactions - Serious adverse reaction , include anaphylaxis , occur Zostavax . Adequate treatment provision , include epinephrine injection ( 1:1,000 ) , available immediate use anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reaction occur . Transmission Vaccine Virus - Transmission vaccine virus may occur vaccinee susceptible contact . Concurrent Illness - Deferral consider acute illness ( example , presence fever ) patient active untreated tuberculosis . Limitations Vaccine Effectiveness - Vaccination Zostavax result protection vaccine recipient . The duration protection beyond 4 year vaccination Zostavax unknown . The need revaccination define . Zostavax indicate nursing mother . It unknown vaccine secrete human milk , therefore , caution use nursing woman . Blood draw : There two blood draw 6 week apart minimal risk . Risks include bruising , redness , swell site . Confidentiality : The identity subject protect . Subjects assign unique identifier . Study relate data keep database password protection lock office . The Key store separately lock file cabinet lock office . Data publish present complete anonymity subject . The study team meet weekly discus trial evaluate adverse event unanticipated event . All event monitor closely . The study team follow injection site reaction , development Herpes Zoster , hepatic decompensation hospitalization . A thorough history physical do screening need reduce chance adverse event . Consent process documentation A member study team obtain sign informed consent subject participate trial adequate explanation research purpose , personnel , procedure , risk benefit , reiteration research voluntary . All subject 's question answer satisfaction . The subject give plenty time decide participation make feel obligate coerce . Obtaining informed consent process , document . If risk change course project , may necessary re-consent subject ensure fully inform still agree participate . The informed consent document IRB approve . The sign informed consent keep least 3 year study end .</detailed_description>
