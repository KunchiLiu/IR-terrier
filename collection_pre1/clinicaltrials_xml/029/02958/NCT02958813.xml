	<brief_title>An Integrated HIV Prevention Model African American Mothers Daughters</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Disproportionate rate mental illness HIV/STIs among African Americans ( AA ) reflect significant health disparity . AAs account HIV/AIDS case , people live HIV/AIDS , HIV-related death racial group US . In 2004 , HIV 3rd lead cause death among Black woman , 2006 , AA woman account 66 % new AIDS case among woman . AA youth age 13 - 19 comprise approximately 16 % US teens 69 % new AIDS case . Most infection among AA woman girl occur sexual activity , AA girl report risky sex , less condom use , low perceive HIV risk AA boys . Racial disparity also exist AAs rate gonorrhea , chlamydia , syphilis . Among 15 - 19 year old AA girl , gonorrhea rate higher race/age/gender group , almost half AA woman STI . Important linkage exist HIV/STIs mental health ; Mental illness link HIV great risk taking , poor health promotion , reduce effect behavioral intervention teen adult . HIV-risk factor extend beyond individual woman girl , yet family-based , gender-specific , Afrocentric program simultaneously address AA woman , AA girl , mental health , mother-daughter dyad , thereby miss critical opportunity address HIV broader social context . Interventions sensitive gender culture focus woman ( SISTA ) girl ( SiHLE ) lack mental health family component . Family-based HIV prevention program rarely address gender culture adult family member 's HIV risk ( Project STYLE ) . Simultaneously target multiple level integrate program -- mother-daughter dyad , woman , girl -- capitalize reciprocal impact mother daughter , facilitate mutual reinforcement prevention attitude behavior , thereby reduce intervention decay sustain positive outcome time . IMARA ( Informed , Motivated , Aware , Responsible AIDS ) blend gender ethnic component SISTA SiHLE ( gender role , ethnic pride , relationship power ) family mental health component Project STYLE ( affect management , parental monitoring , adolescent development , parent-child communication ) create culturally relevant , multi-level , integrate , family-based , HIV mental health prevention program simultaneously target AA woman daughter . Based Theory Gender Power , Social-Personal model HIV-risk , find investigator 's research , IMARA emphasize interplay family , peer , partner , individual mechanism mediator sexual risk take woman girl . Pilot test ( N=22 dyad ) reveal strong feasibility , acceptability , tolerability : &gt; 95 % consent/assent rate , 96 % retention 2-month follow-up , positive feedback . Promising outcome data mother daughter target mediator ( e.g. , positive attitude HIV/AIDS , great intention use condom , increase parental monitoring , open mother-daughter communication , relationship power ) sexual risk outcome ( e.g. , increased condom use , few partner ) justify randomize controlled trial . This study three specific aim : 1 . To conduct 2-arm randomize control trial compare IMARA family-based health program ( FUELTM ) . Investigators : a. Randomly assign 300 14-18 year-old AA black girl primary female caregiver IMARA ( N=150 ) FUELTM ( N=150 ) .

Test woman girl ' urine three common STIs baseline 12-month follow . 2 . Explore linkages biological outcome target mediator moderator change . Hypotheses IMARA participant report less risky sex ( few partner , consistent condom use , later sexual debut among non-sexually active girl ) 6- 12-months few incident STI infection 12-months ; ( b ) IMARA participant report positive change theoretical mediator : individual attribute ( positive condom attitude , self-efficacy , ethnic pride ) , peer/partner influence ( relationship power , partner communication , awareness partner influence sexual decision making ) , mental health ( improve emotion regulation understand link mental illness risky sex ) , mother-daughter communication ( open comfortable ) , mother-daughter relationship ( parental monitoring warmth , less parental permissiveness ) .</detailed_description>
