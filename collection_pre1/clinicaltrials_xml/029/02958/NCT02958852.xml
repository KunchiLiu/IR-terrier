	<brief_title>A Clinical Trial Compare Efficacy Tolerability Atorvastatin Addition Endocrine Treatment With Focus Mechanisms Resistance Endocrine Treatment ( Fulvestrant/Aromatase Inhibitors ) Patients With Advanced Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomized , open-labelled , phase II trial first second-line metastatic treatment setting , compare standard endocrine treatment ( aromatase inhibitor ( AI ) ) endocrine treatment plus atorvastatin ( 1:1 ) . Upon progression first line setting , part translational study mechanisms resistance endocrine therapy , patient receive second line endocrine treatment use fulvestrant . Upon progression first line treatment , patient receive atorvastatin stop treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Women confirm ER positive/HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer , include locally advanced stage IV disease , require systemic endocrine treatment . 2 . Age &gt; 18 year . 3 . Performance status Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) â‰¤ 2 . 4 . Metastatic disease must radiologically clinically assessable , mean least one follow technique : clinical examination , computerize tomography ( CT ) , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , bone scintigraphy positron emission tomography ( PET ) . Bone metastases alone allow . 5 . Premenopausal patient must consent undergo either surgical chemical castration duration treatment utilize effective contraception barrier method . 6 . Patient willing undergo study specific biopsy metastatic site preferably enough metastatic tumor sample material archive perform RNA extraction formalin fix paraffin embed ( FFPE ) material . 7 . Patient must capable willing grant sign informed consent prior procedure relate study well allow access FFPE biopsies RNA extraction serial circulate tumor cell capture . Biopsy metastatic site upon progression mandatory desirable . 8 . Signed informed consent accord International Conference Harmonization /Good Clinical Practice , national/local regulation . 9 . Patients currently firstline treatment AI metastatic breast cancer participate first part treatment ( take lower cholesterol drug , already AIs metastatic disease study open ) eligible enter second part study mechanisms resistance fulvestrant progress AI . 10 . Patients progress take AI adjuvant treatment , confirm hormone receptor+ metastatic breast cancer deem suitable first line AI also eligible enter directly second part study treat fulvestrant upfront . 1 . Previous treatment metastatic breast cancer ( previous systemic treatment early breast cancer allow ) , unless consider direct entry second part study fulvestrant ( see inclusion criterion 9 10 ) . 2 . Brain site metastatic breast cancer . 3 . Ongoing treatment statin ( e.g . simvastatin , atorvastatin , fluvastatin , lovastatin , pravastatin , rosuvastatin ) , anionexchangers ( e.g . colestyramin colesevelam ) , fibrates ( e.g . gemfibrozil ) , nicotinacids ( acipimox ) inhibitor intestinal cholesterol uptake ( e.g.ezetimibe ) first part trial . 4 . Evidence hepatic dysfunction ( alanine aminotransferase level three time upper limit normal range ) renal dysfunction ( creatine kinase level ) three time upper limit normal range . 5 . Known coagulation disorder treatment 4hydroxycoumarin derivative exclusion criterion fulvestrant treat patient . 6 . Treatment anticoagulant 4hydroxycoumarin derivative antiplatelet drug . Patients treatment heparin interrupt treatment 24h prior biopsy resume treatment 12h biopsy perform . In case patient treat clopidogrel salicylate , able interrupt treatment 57 day biopsy resume 24h . 7 . History hemorrhagic stroke . 8 . Pregnancy breastfeed . 9 . Untreated psychiatric disorder impair patient 's ability comply study treatment protocol . 10 . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biological composition either study drug .</criteria>
