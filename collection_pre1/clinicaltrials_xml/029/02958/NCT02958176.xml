All participant complete baseline assessment , rest state HRV vaginal pulse amplitude ( VPA ) measure . The participant two biofeedback condition receive train HRV biofeedback experimenter , provide material necessary guide self-practice HRV biofeedback home . Participants two condition instructed engage at-home HRV biofeedback ( without autogenic train ) least 5 time period two week , report level arousal sexual activity diary . Participants wait-list control condition report level arousal sexual activity diary . After two week , participant three condition return laboratory , physiological psychological sexual arousal measure . Over next two week , participant two biofeedback condition ask complete 5 self-guided biofeedback session along sexual activity diary . Participants three condition return lab final assessment measure post-treatment HRV VPA level well psychological sexual arousal .
