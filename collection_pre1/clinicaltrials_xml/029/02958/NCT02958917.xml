	<brief_summary>Patients offer participation pirfenidone trial They diagnose fibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis ( FHP ) , type interstitial lung disease ( ILD ) . This disease scar lung tissue occur result inhale substance call antigen . These antigen substance mold , chemical dust . As result scar lung able move oxygen bloodstream reach organ . Currently 1400 subject treat pirfenidone 15 clinical trial . This drug approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) use Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis , different type ILD , require special permission use condition . The use pirfenidone approve treatment FHP . It consider experimental treatment study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Efficacy Safety Pirfenidone Patients With Fibrotic Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study evaluate potential benefit safety treatment pirfenidone compare placebo subject FHP . STUDY SUMMARY This study include 40 subject National Jewish Health . This `` double blind study '' mean neither subject study staff know subject get pirfenidone placebo study . This do sure one know get pirfenidone placebo effect treatment measure objectively , without bias . Subject 's enroll study equal chance get pirfenidone placebo . The decision treatment subject receive ( randomization ) make central organization . Subjects study receive either pirfenidone ( 2403 mg every day ) placebo capsule ( safe , inactive substance look pirfenidone capsule ) . Both placebo pirfenidone supply opaque , hard , white gelatin capsule take 3 capsule mouth , 3 time day ( total 9 capsule per day ) take food . Subjects participate study , ask take capsule prescribe every day 52 week ( 12 month ) .</detailed_description>

Diagnosis possible definite FHP HRCT accord prespecified criterion ( Note : HRCT scan perform within 6 month start screening may use meet image acquisition guideline ) : . Definite FHP : Evidence lung fibrosis ( reticular abnormality and/or , traction bronchiectasis and/or , architectural distortion , and/or honeycomb ) one associate finding : 1 . Multilobular inspiratory mosaic attenuation 2 . Multilobular air trap expiratory image 3 . Profuse centrilobular ground glass nodular opacity ii . Possible FHP : Evidence lung fibrosis ( ) absence associate finding . . These patient require known exposure BAL lymphocytosis transbronchial biopsy demonstrate nonnecrotizing granuloma . FHP Disease Severity Progression 4 . FVC ≥40 % , DLCO ≥30 % base either historical pulmonary function test obtain 30 day prior screen test obtain screen 5 . In investigator 's opinion , evidence improvement measure FHP disease severity precede year . 6 . Able walk ≥100 6minute walk test ( 6MWT ) Screening . Informed Consent Protocol Adherence 7 .
