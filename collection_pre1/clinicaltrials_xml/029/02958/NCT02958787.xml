	<brief_title>Vessel Sparing Prostate Radiation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The vast majority patient diagnosed prostate cancer modern era PSA screen localize potentially curable disease . Patients number excellent treatment option consider , quality life follow treatment often consideration treatment choice . One critical quality life concern patient diagnose prostate cancer sexual function . Studies sexual function post-radiation therapy fall three category : incidence study ; correlative ( dose toxicity ) study ; mechanism ( functional ) study . All study point vascular mechanism impotence post-radiation therapy , oppose nerve-based mechanism follow surgery . In study , critical vascular structure ( internal pudendal artery corpus cavernosum ) define MRI-based imaging include treatment planning radiation treatment . Investigators propose technique improve quality life , sexual function , relapse-free survival . This study 's primary aim determine erectile function preservation rate 5-years post-vessel-sparing radiotherapy without aid use patient report use simplify three-question erectile function scale .</detailed_description>
