	<brief_title>Multimodal Narcotic Limited Perioperative Pain Control With Colorectal Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postoperative ileus well-known problem patient undergone colorectal procedure . It manifest abdominal distension , accumulation gas fluid within bowel delay bowel function ( flatus defecation ) . It estimate traditional perioperative care open colon resection postoperative ileus lead length stay ( LOS ) 10 day . Such factor include use narcotic , immobilization , over-hydration IV fluid etc . With 350,000 colon small bowel resection occur annually bill healthcare system great US $ 20 billion , even decrease LOS one two day result substantial cost saving . All patient undergo colorectal surgery require medication pain control . The mainstay current treatment include narcotics/opioids . The effect medicine mu receptor intestine contribute delay bowel function . Protocols limit use narcotics/opioids may reduce risk ileus , thus reduce length stay reduce cost . A prospective randomize clinical trial single tertiary referral academic affiliate medical center ( OSF St. Francis Medical Center ) . Patients undergo minimally invasive ( laparoscopic robotic ) colorectal resection consider inclusion . Surgery perform two surgeon participate study protocol . Patient accrual intend begin May 1 , 2016 terminate either 80 patient accrued December 31 , 2018 , whichever first . Informed consent obtain preoperative education provide ( appendix A ) . Patients randomize one two group . The randomization scheme random-permuted-block design without stratification . The block size random number 4 8 . Personnel unassociated patient screening , enrollment , follow-up create allocation sequence use computerize , random number generator . The allocation sequence transfer sequentially number , opaque envelope purpose allocation concealment . Clinical trial coordinators/physicians verify patient eligibility inform consent open envelope obtain treatment assignment . The experimental group place narcotic limited protocol describe . All used medication FDA approve . No investigational medicine use .</detailed_description>
