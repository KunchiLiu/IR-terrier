	<brief_summary>Cerebral accumulation tau beta-amyloid major factor Alzheimer 's disease pathology . A novel Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) tracer ( 18-F-AV-1451 ) offer ability study tau protein deposition vivo subject , information cerebral amyloid deposition already gather . This enable study effect tau deposition neuronal integrity , relation effect beta-amyloid deposition contributes cognitive impairment well-being elderly .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This single-center exploratory observational clinical study combine cross sectional longitudinal aspect . It contain 18F-AV-1451-PET intervention . The primary objective measure tau deposition 18-F-AV1451-PET base voxel wise volume base quantitative assessment study effect Tau deposition organism identification factor correlate measure tau deposition . Study participant follow 5 year . To date cerebral tau pathology vivo estimate cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) tau CSF phospho-tau precludes study topical distribution interplay Abeta pathology . 18F-AV-1451 offer chance visualize tau pathology study effect tau brain structure , brain physiology cognitive function . Ideally , effect study well characterized individual important pathological factor already know . We therefore plan study tau pathology measure 18F-AV-1451 subject already exist data cerebral amyloid deposition ( 11C-Pittsburgh Compound C , Flutemetamol ) . We able relate tau pathology past prospective cognitive performance assess detailed neuro¬psychological examination , able investigate whether cerebral tau pathology reflect peripheral blood biomarkers . For purpose include elderly subject various degree cognitive performance ( cognitively healthy , mild cognitive impairment , dementia ) various degree cerebral amyloid deposition ( dichotomized quantitative ) . We also include Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration ( FTLD ) case study tau effect neurodegenerative disease absence beta-amyloid . Our hypothesis follow : 1 . We assume possible identify tau deposition subject without cerebral Abeta deposition . 2 . We hypothesize tau-deposition associate structural physiological brain change synergistic effect amount tau Abeta pathology certain brain region cognitive function .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Subject belong one follow group : No cognitive impairment ( N=100 ) Mild cognitive impairment accord Winblad et al. , 20041 ( N=50 ) Clinical diagnosis dementia due Alzheimer 's disease ( N=30 ) compatible DSM IV criterion revise NINCDSADRDA criteria14 Evidence neurodegenerative disease AD ( N=20 ) 2 . Written informed consent approve regulatory authority 3 . Age ≥ 50 year , woman must without childbearing potential ; male study subject fe¬male partner pregnant childbearing potential must agree refrain sexual activity 24 hour follow administration 18FAV1451 injection . Male study subject donate sperm 24 hour follow administration 18FAV1451 injection . 4 . Preexisting PET information ( 11CPittsburgh Compound B , 18FFlutemetamol ) cerebral amyloid deposition 5 . German speak bilingual include German 6 . Subject willing able name informant give adequate information scale informant input require 1 . Evidence cognitive impairment mainly attribute nonneurodegenerative underlying medical condition ( e.g . medication , brain tumor , severe heart insufficiency , hepatic encephalopathy ) 2 . Evidence large cerebral infarct , lacunes critical memory structure 3 . Disease condition potential interfere study participation 4 . Severe illness likely cause disability interfere study procedure follow year 5 . Evidence acute psychiatric disease ( upon clinical decision ) may cause cognitive impairment . Patients history major depression stable medication may include . Patients low dose intake benzodiazepine may also include upon clinician 's decision 6 . Previous current participation antibetaamyloid antitau therapeutic trial 7 . MR exclusion criterion 8 . PET exclusion criterion 9 . Contraindications venous puncture 10 .
