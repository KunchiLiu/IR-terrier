	<brief_title>Supine vs. Upright Weight Bearing MRI Evaluation Patients With Lumbar Spondylolisthesis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Detailed Description Spondylolisthesis spinal condition one vertebral body slide forward relation vertebra sometimes associate spinal instability . Lumbar spondylolisthesis relatively common problem generally diagnose radiograph . MRI often use evaluate condition determine nerve root compression involve . One potential disadvantage traditional MRI evaluate spondylolisthesis image perform patient lie supine scanner . This create potential superior vertebra slide posteriorly extent slip may fully appreciate , see . Use upright weight bear MRI provide opportunity image spine position patient likely experience symptom similar stand radiograph . MRI Acquisition : Each patient undergo MRI scan supine weight bearing position image session . If determine patient consent participate study MRI make due safety concern ( metallic implant contraindication MRI identify recruit ) , discontinue study another patient recruit fulfill plan number image available analysis . The MRI procedure standard lumbar spine scan protocol use Esaote G-scan , open unit . Patients scan supine unit rotate 81 degree horizontal weight bear scan . Immediately scan , patient complete visual analog scale ( VAS ) assess back leg pain . Researcher ( ) perform image assessment blind position scan make . Data record image Meyerding scale ( 1-4 scale rating severity spondylolisthesis ) , amount slip ( mm ) , anterior posterior disc space height ( mm ) , foraminal area , anteroposterior ( AP ) distance narrow part foramen , disc space angulation . Area spinal canal AP distance across canal measure axial image . The facet fluid sign , associate spinal instability , assess axial MRI view use 3-point scale `` none '' indicate evidence fluid leave right facet joint ; `` possible '' suggestion fluid joint ; `` definite '' least 2 mm wide layer hyperintensity within either joint bilaterally level evaluate . Additionally , width fluid fill facet joint take perpendicular apparent joint line , large value record effusion size . Clinical Assessments : VAS separately assess back leg pain complete immediately supine scan immediately weight bear scanning . Analysis conduct determine difference pain correlate change image take two position . Statistical method : Parametric measure compare two image position use paired t-tests . Pairwise categorical data analyze use McNemar analysis . In secondary study deal facet fluid sign , mean value translation , disc height , foraminal area , AP distance compare across three facet fluid sign category use ANOVA . Changes back leg pain analyzed determine relationship change change note positional MRI . It anticipate section study produce statistically significant result , hopefully provide guidance possibly investigate parameter future study . From routine clinical lateral flexion/extension radiograph , change translation two position measure . If lateral neutral radiograph available , translation well anterior posterior disc height measure . All measurement make use method describe MRIs . Sample size : At least 25 patient , 60 patient include . After 25 patient image , data analyze determine appropriate sample size determine statistically significant difference measurement make supine upright weight bearing image .</detailed_description>
