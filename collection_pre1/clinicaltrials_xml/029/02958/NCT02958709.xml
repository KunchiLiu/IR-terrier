	<brief_summary>In open-labeled , randomized clinical trial , Investigator ass safety pharmacokinetics ( PK ) model-optimized dos rifampicin ( RIF ) without levofloxacin ( LEVO ) give child part multidrug treatment tuberculous meningitis ( TBM ) versus standard treatment . The Investigators also assess functional neurocognitive outcome treatment group , measure Pediatric Modified Rankin Score ( MRS ) Mullen Scales Early Learning ( MSEL ) , respectively .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Open-label , randomize clinical trial three treatment group . Patients probable definite TB meningitis ( TBM ) receive isoniazid pyrazinamide standard dos 8 week . Arm 1 participant receive high-dose rifampicin plus ethambutol ( EMB ) standard dose 8 week . Arm 2 participant receive high-dose rifampicin plus levofloxacin 8 week . Arm 3 participant receive rifampicin plus ethambutol standard dose 8 week ( control arm ) . Patients screen confirm TBM diagnosis , receive 8 week study treatment , receive isoniazid ( INH ) /rifampicin additional 40 week , complete 12 month TBM treatment . All participant receive oral steroid . PK sample perform within first week 6 ( +/- 2 ) week follow treatment initiation . Participants schedule follow-up visit ass safety clinical status . In addition , functional neurocognitive outcome 18 month follow treatment initiation assess . Interim PK safety analysis perform ensure dose produce predefined PK target safety acceptable . It anticipate majority child hospitalize initial 2-8 week study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Weight &gt; 6kg Age â‰¥ 6 month &lt; 12 year , opinion investigator , tolerate treatment study participation . Probable definite TBM accord diagnostic criterion positive Gene Xpert cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) test . Since participant legal age independent consent , parent legal guardian must willing able provide inform consent . If subject appropriate age , she/he also ask give assent developmentally appropriate clinically possible . Participant comply protocol requirement opinion site investigator . TB treatment &gt; 7 day Exposure via close contact someone multi drug resistant TB ( MDRTB ) ( rifampicin monoresistant TB ) personal history MDRTB ( rifampicin monoresistant TB ) Known intolerance allergy study drug Death imminent expect within 24 hour , assess site investigator Moderate severe renal liver dysfunction ( Grade 2 high abnormality creatinine , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , direct bilirubin ) HIV infection follow : Planned initiation antiretroviral treatment ( ART ) experimental treatment phase ( first 8 week ) , initiation ART contraindicate time period TBM . On ART plan continue use protease inhibitor nevirapine ( child switch acceptable alternative regimen participate ) Having participate clinical study investigational agent treatment within 8 week prior enrollment . A clinically significant active medical condition presence concomitant severe illness rapidly deteriorate health condition ( outside TB ) , , opinion site investigator , would prevent appropriate participation trial , would make implementation protocol interpretation study result difficult , otherwise make subject poor candidate clinical trial .</criteria>
