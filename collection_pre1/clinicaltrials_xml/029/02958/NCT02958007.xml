	<brief_title>Peer Support Exercise Older Veterans With Psychotic Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anticipated Impacts Veteran 's Healthcare : Older Veterans psychotic disorder face unique barrier engagement health-promoting activity , include prototypical feature psychosis ( e.g. , negative symptom , medication side effect ) exacerbate feature age process ( e.g. , increase medical comorbidity , decline musculoskeletal health ) . It critical develop strategy empower group overcome barrier engage health behavior improve function quality life . Peer intervention , intervention deliver individual similar patient population characteristic age diagnosis , effectively promote engagement health behavior range population . Despite promise peer support urgent need older adult psychosis , well-specified peer support intervention promote participation health behavior tailor need group . The present study yield well-specified group-based peer coaching intervention , deliver VA Peer Specialists ( Veterans recovery mental illness ) , target empower old Veterans psychosis overcome barrier , increase exercise/physical activity , improve functioning . Project Background : Over next two decade , Veterans psychotic disorder ( i.e. , schizophrenia spectrum disorder affective psychosis ) age old adulthood unprecedented number . The challenge treat grow population associate high cost profound implication VHA . Older adult psychotic disorder exhibit diminished physical psychosocial functioning increase risk rapid functional decline early institutionalization nursing home . Participation structure exercise delay functional disability old adult ; however , old adult psychosis exhibit low exercise participation . While peer-delivered exercise intervention older adult promote initiation maintenance exercise physical activity , peer-delivered exercise intervention tailor unique need older adult psychosis . The present study aim fill critical gap . Project Objectives : This study develop pilot test well-specified , group-based peer coach intervention tailor unique need older Veterans psychotic disorder : Peer Education Exercise Recovery ( PEER ) . PEER provide intensive coach VA Peer Specialist promote participation supervise fitness training program old Veterans . To develop intervention , material exist peer-delivered wellness intervention Veterans serious mental illness tailor old Veterans psychosis , iterative process synthesize extant literature pilot data , develop draft material , obtain feedback multidisciplinary panel expert mentors/consultants Peer Specialists/Veteran consumer . A small open trial PEER conduct 6 old Veterans psychotic disorder ( age 50 ) ; qualitative interview explore participant ' perception PEER . Finally , pilot randomize control trial ( RCT ) PEER conduct . Older Veterans psychotic disorder ( age 50 , n=50 ) enrol supervised fitness training randomize receive group-based peer coaching ( PEER condition ) individual support non-peer staff ( enhance supervise fitness training ( ESFT ) condition ) . Feasibility PEER ( rate recruitment , intervention engagement , peer coach fidelity ) measure . The impact PEER versus ESFT attendance exercise session , level physical activity , physical functioning examine . Additionally , PI engage training activity develop expertise functional rehabilitation old adult psychosis . Project Methods : This project include develop intervention material PEER , conduct open trial PEER small sample , complete small RCT . The investigator monitor acceptability feasibility ; study Veterans ' experience ; measure exercise/physical activity behavior functional outcome .</detailed_description>
