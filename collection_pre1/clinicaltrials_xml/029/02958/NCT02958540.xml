	<detailed_description>A total 48 healthy adult volunteer age 18 49 year recruit . The first 24 subject randomize 3:1 SynGEM® low dose level ( 140 μg F-protein/2mg BLPs ) placebo administer Day 1 Day 29 ( Group 1 ) . After completion recruitment Group 1 , pause rule meet 7 day post prime Group 1 subject , 24 additional subject randomize 3:1 SynGEM® high dose level ( 350 μg F-protein/2mg BLPs ) placebo administer Day 1 Day 29 ( Group 2 ) . Recruitment guide pre-specified pausing rule . Recruitment Group 1 stagger follow : sentinel cohort 2 subject ( 1 subject receive SynGEM® 1 subject receive placebo ) recruit study Day 1 ; subject follow Visit 2 ( 3 day post-dosing ) pause rule meet , second cohort 2 subject ( 1 subject receive SynGEM® 1 subject receive placebo ) vaccinate ; subject follow Visit 2 ( 3 day post-dosing ) pause rule meet , recruitment extend remain 20 subject ( 16 SynGEM®/4 placebo ) Group 1 . Escalation high dose level implement collection safety data subject Group 1 least 7 day post-prime pause rule meet . Group 2 also comprise total 24 subject recruitment stagger subjected pausing rule Group 1 . Each subject return site study visit 3 , 7 28 day post-prime vaccination ; 28 day prime vaccination boost vaccination administer subject return 3 , 7 , 28 day boost vaccination . A primary analysis carry data collect timepoints . Subjects follow safety immunogenicity thereafter 180 day post-prime .</detailed_description>
