	<brief_summary>Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) preventable cause stroke . However , despite widely available risk stratification tool , five option oral anticoagulation , evidence-based practice guideline , anticoagulation stroke prevention AF consistently under-prescribed . Data center ( Brigham Women 's Hospital [ BWH ] ) ( 1 ) demonstrate few 50 % outpatient AF high-risk stroke accord 2012 Focused Update European Society Cardiology Guidelines Management AF ( 2 ) receive anticoagulation . Aim # 1 : To determine impact electronic alert-based computerized decision support ( CDS ) prescription anticoagulation high-risk AF patient outpatient set prescribed anticoagulation stroke prevention . Hypothesis # 1 : Electronic alert-based CDS increase prescription anticoagulation 80 % high-risk AF patient outpatient set prescribed anticoagulation stroke prevention . Aim # 2 : To determine impact electronic alert-based computerized decision support ( CDS ) frequency stroke systemic embolic event high-risk AF patient outpatient set prescribed anticoagulation stroke prevention . Hypothesis # 2 : Electronic alert-based CDS reduce frequency stroke systemic embolism high-risk AF patient outpatient set prescribed anticoagulation stroke prevention .

	<detailed_description>AF associate increase risk fatal disable ischemic stroke . Despite widely accessible evidence-based clinical practice guideline , risk stratification tool ( CHA2DS2-VASc HAS-BLED ) five effective oral antithrombotic agent stroke prevention ( 22 ) , least 40 % high-risk patient AF worldwide remain unprotected failure prescribe anticoagulation . The failure prevent stroke AF become critical international patient safety crisis . The root cause underutilization include lack provider patient education importance stroke prevention AF , inadequate risk stratification , concern regard bleed risk anticoagulant therapy . We surprise learn even BWH , underutilization anticoagulation stroke prevention AF continue concern ( 1 ) . The failure prevent stroke AF similar crisis VTE prevention among hospitalized patient decade ago . To address critical patient safety problem , evaluate impact alert-based CDS VTE prevention ( 18 ) . First , design software link Electronic Health Record ( EHR ) provider order entry program identify hospitalized patient risk VTE use weight risk score prophylaxis order . Patients randomized intervention group , responsible physician receive electronic alert regard risk VTE recommendation regard prophylaxis , control group , alert issue . Compared control group , electronic alert double rate thromboprophylaxis order ( 14.5 % 33.5 % ; p &lt; 0.0001 ) . The risk symptomatic VTE reduce 41 % ( hazard ratio , 0.59 ; 95 % confidence interval 0.43-0.81 ; p=0.001 ) among patient electronic alert issue . We also show `` human '' ( person-to-person ) alert-based decision support prevention VTE at-risk hospitalize patient doubled rate VTE prophylaxis compare control hospitalization ( 21 ) discharge ( 19 ) . The current study determine impact electronic alert-based CDS prescription anticoagulation high-risk AF patient outpatient set prescribed anticoagulation stroke prevention . Because Quality Improvement initiative , mandate specific antithrombotic agent , regimen , duration . We provide option anticoagulation prevent stroke AF allow provider make best choice base clinical judgment . If contraindication anticoagulation risk outweigh benefit antithrombotic therapy , provider elect omit anticoagulation need provide rationale . The current study also determine impact electronic alert-based CDS frequency stroke systemic embolic event high-risk AF patient outpatient set prescribed anticoagulation stroke prevention . Data acquire study regard frequency stroke systemic embolism use calculate sample size requirement future clinical end-point driven randomize control trial electronic alert prevent stroke high-risk AF patient .</detailed_description>
