	<brief_title>Hypofractionated Radiation Therapy Patients With Breast Cancer Receiving Regional Nodal Irradiation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants stage II stage III node-positive breast cancer randomly assign either conventional radiation 6 week hypofractionated radiation 4 week . We hypothesize patient receive short course radiation reduce lymphedema . Lymphedema diagnose patient 's arm circumference measure 10 % compare pre-treatment ( baseline ) arm circumference measurement . Secondary endpoint address effectiveness , quality life , side effect profile shorten course treatment .</detailed_description>
