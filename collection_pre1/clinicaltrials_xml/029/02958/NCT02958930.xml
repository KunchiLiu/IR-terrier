	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine safety initial efficacy Transcranial Electromagnetic Treatment ( TEMT ) patient mild/moderate Alzheimer 's Disease . Throughout 2-month treatment period , patient evaluate cognitive performance , brain energy utilization , functional brain imaging , blood/cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) markers Alzheimer 's Disease . Since patient receive TEMT , patient 's baseline measurement serve control treatment effect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Transcranial Electromagnetic Treatment Against Alzheimer 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There currently effective therapeutic stabilize reverse cognitive impairment Alzheimer 's Disease ( AD ) relate dementia . Clinical trial drug unsuccessful wrong therapeutic target/species select , drug great difficulty traverse blood-brain barrier get neuron , and/or drug largely single mechanism action . Since ever-increasing experimental evidence indicate toxic form beta-amyloid tau soluble `` oligomeric '' specie two protein , therapeutic disaggregate oligomers within neuron represent perhaps best chance attain cognitive benefit AD patient . Pre-clinical study perform Sponsor collaborator demonstrate AD transgenic mouse treat daily electromagnetic wave radiofrequency ( RF ) range protect cognitive impairment show reversal pre-existing cognitive impairment . These cognitive benefit appear due primarily two complimentary mechanism : 1 ) disaggregation toxic protein oligomers within neuron , 2 ) mitochondrial enhancement increase energy metabolism . Moreover , deleterious effect treatment many month observe pre-clinical study . In order provide similar treatment mild/moderate Alzheimer 's patient clinically , NeuroEM Therapeutics develop unique head device provide electromagnetic ( RF ) treatment entire human forebrain level similar provide cognitive benefit pre-clinical study . Using MemorEM 1000 head device present Phase I trial , AD patient receive twice daily 1-hour treatment in-home , administer caregiver . The device allow patient complete mobility move throughout home . A comprehensive array marker analyze follow 2-month treatment period , baseline ( pre-treatment ) value serve control . Cognitive safety efficacy evaluate use variety cognitive assessment include ADAS-cog ( Primary ) , secondary cognitive measure include ADCS-ADL , Rey AVLT , Trails A &amp; B , Digit span , clock draw task . Treatment effect brain energy metabolism determine FDG-PET scan , treatment effect brain functional connectivity determine rest state MRI Diffusion Tensor Imaging . Also assessed effect treatment various beta-amyloid tau protein specie ( e.g. , monomer , oligomers ) blood CSF . Safety treatment monitor regular Adverse Events Assessment , physiologic monitoring , patient daily diary maintain caregiver . Expected Results : The investigator expect 2-months daily electromagnetic ( RF ) treatment present significant side effect safety issue . The investigator expect cognitive measure stable and/or improve end treatment . In addition , investigator anticipate brain functional connectivity may improve enhanced brain metabolism ( FDG-PET ) occur . Changes blood/CSF level various beta-amyloid tau specie also anticipate .</detailed_description>
