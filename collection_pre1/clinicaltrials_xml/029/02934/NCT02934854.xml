	<detailed_description>The creatine deficiency syndrome ( CDS ) group inborn error metabolism interrupt biosynthesis transportation creatine . Individuals creatine deficiency syndrome classically present intellectual disability seizure disorder may present pyramidal/extrapyramidal neurologic finding behavioral problem well . There three Cerebral Creatine Deficiency Syndromes : - Creatine Transporter Deficiency ( CTD ) - gene SLC6A8 - Guanidinoacetate Methyltransferase Deficiency ( GAMT ) - gene GAMT - Arginine : Glycine Amidinotransferase Deficiency ( AGAT ) - gene GATM X-linked Creatine Transporter Deficiency ( CTD , SLC6A8 Deficiency , CRTR ) : X-linked creatine transporter deficiency ( CRTR-D ) creatine deficiency syndrome ( see term ) characterize clinically global developmental delay / intellectual disability ( DD/ID ) prominent speech/language delay , autistic behavior seizure . CRTR-D report 150 individual worldwide . The onset symptom occur infancy , usually age 2 year . Males mainly affect , female also various combination severity disease manifestation . CRTR-D consistently characterize mild severe intellectual deficit , expressive speech language delay . Behavioral disorder ( mainly autism hyperactivity ) present affected individual . Affected individual often experience seizure may present low weight gain , muscular hypotonia , poor muscle mass . Subtle dysmorphic feature midface hypoplasia , long face , prominent chin report various affected male patient . Epilepsy extrapyramidal symptom may also occur occasionally . In adult patient , cardiac gastrointestinal disorder report . Carrier females typically asymptomatic , learn disability describe . CRTR-D life threaten disease , however live expectancy limit , particularly severe seizure associate physical disability . Guanidinoacetate Methyltransferase Deficiency ( GAMT ) Mutations GAMT gene relatively rare cause creatine deficiency syndrome . Affected individual may demonstrate cerebral creatine deficiency MR spectroscopy high GAA urine . Guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency inherit autosomal recessive manner cause biallelic mutation GAMT gene . This gene map 19p13.3 involved biosynthesis creatine . Individuals GAMT deficiency typically present severe intellectual disability seizure disorder may resistant drug therapy . Behavioral problem , include autistic behavior self-mutilation common , pyramidal/extrapyramidal symptom affect one-half patient GAMT deficiency . Dietary management GAMT deficiency via manipulation critical amino acid may improve clinical outcome . Arginine : Glycine Amidinotransferase ( AGAT ) : L-Arginine : glycine amidinotransferase ( AGAT ) deficiency rare type creatine deficiency syndrome characterize global developmental delay , intellectual disability , myopathy . AGAT deficiency characterize global developmental delay , appear infancy , associate language impairment autistic behavior , well mild moderate intellectual disability . Progressive muscle weakness fatigability report old patient . Seizures failure thrive also describe . If creatine supplementation administer early enough , psychomotor delay may avoid . AGAT deficiency cause mutation L-arginine : glycine amidinotransferase gene ( GATM ) locate chromosome 15q15.1 . This gene encode AGAT , convert arginine glycine ornithine guanidino-acetate creatine cycle pathway . AGAT deficiency transmit autosomal recessive manner genetic counseling possible . New method , like mass-spectrometry give good chance characterize specific metabolic alteration blood ( plasma ) affect patient allow diagnose future disease earlier , high sensitivity specificity . Therefore goal study identify validate new biochemical marker plasma affect patient help benefit patient early diagnose thereby earlier treatment .</detailed_description>
