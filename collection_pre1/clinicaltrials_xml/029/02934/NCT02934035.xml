	<brief_summary>Major depressive disorder ( MDD ) affect around 7 % population yearly . Although effective treatment available , around half patient participate clinical trial respond 6 12 week antidepressant treatment . Given high failure rate , ability predict early possible whether patient ( un ) likely respond would great value , would enable physician change treatment strategy faster . Early improvement consistently find strong predictor later response . However , misclassification still quite common , perhaps third show early improvement go respond . Conversely , substantial proportion show early improvement go respond . One possibility improve predictive power early improvement examine individual symptom , rather total score depression rating scale . Some item , example , could reflect antidepressant side effect ( e.g . gastrointestinal symptom ) may predictive . The propose project aim examine relationship early improvement individual symptom response antidepressant large patient sample . This large sample size make possible use rigorous method previous study , use cross-validation confirm finding . It also make possible examine large set predictor , include possible interaction among early-improving symptom symptom demographic factor like age gender . The added value individual symptom use total symptom score alone also examine , well possible difference different antidepressant class . The project use penalize ( lasso ) regression , well-suited analyze data large number ( potentially highly correlate ) predictor . In primary analysis , response 6 week treatment predict . In secondary analysis , remission week 6 response remission week 12 also predict .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Improvement Individual Symptoms Response Antidepressants Patients With Major Depressive Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study design The propose project individual patient data meta-analysis . Data collate 31 trial second-generation antidepressant treatment major depressive disorder , use data trial arm treat placebo Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) -approved antidepressant . These trial include total approximately 7,800 antidepressant-treated 3,000 placebo-treated participant . Penalized regression method ( specifically least absolute shrinkage selection operator , 'lasso ' ) use examine relationship early improvement specific depressive symptom response treatment . Furthermore , investigator examine whether interaction among early-improving symptom early-improving symptom demographic variable age gender improve prediction treatment outcome . Finally , investigator also examine whether prediction response treatment early improvement specific symptom dependent upon type treatment provide ( placebo , selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor [ SSRIs ] serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor [ SNRIs ] ) , would suggest drug-specific mechanism . Statistical Analysis Plan Missing data : A complete case approach take , interest predict response remission participant actually take antidepressant specified period time . Therefore , participant valid baseline , week 2 week 6 ( ±1 ) HDRS score select main analysis ( valid week 12 data secondary analysis week 12 outcome ) . Training validation sample : The data randomly divide 80 % training sample 20 % validation sample ( stratified treatment group ) . Model discovery do training sample , predictive performance model assess validation sample . Predictors : Improvement individual symptom derive HDRS item baseline week 2 . The answer choice item range 0 - 2 7 item 0 - 4 10 item . Early improvement dichotomize `` improvement '' `` improvement '' . `` No improvement '' indicate worsen item score ( e.g . 1 baseline 2 week 2 ) change item score . `` Improvement '' indicate improvement item score ≥1 . Cross-tables use check whether variable highly correlate , one item remove . Baseline score HDRS item also include model order investigate add value improvement individual item baseline item score . For total HDRS-17 score , early improvement also dichotomize no/minor improvement ( &lt; 20 % improvement ) improvement ( ≥20 % improvement ) . The baseline HDRS-17 score standardize included model covariate . With regard demographic factor , gender already dichotomous variable age standardize . Lasso regression : Lasso regression apply follow model : Primary analysis ( antidepressant-treated group ) 1 . A model contain variable early improvement week 2 17 HDRS item , age , gender , two-way interaction variable ; baseline HDRS item score ; additionally total HDRS score baseline early improvement ( ≥20 % improvement score ) total HDRS score week 2 . Exploratory analysis ( participant , include treat placebo ) 2 . As model 1 , include treatment group ( placebo , SSRI , SNRI ) two- three-way interaction treatment group . The tuning parameter ( lambda ) result minimal prediction error ( base deviance ) select help 10-fold cross-validation . The GLMMLasso package multilevel data use fit lasso model , subsequently refit mixed-effects logistic regression use variable select lasso regression . Model performance : Prediction accuracy assess apply mixed-effects logistic regression model independent validation sample . The area curve ( AUC ) receiver-operating characteristic ( ROC ) curve predict response/remission 6 12 week use assess prediction accuracy . Sensitivity , specificity , accuracy ( percentage correct prediction ) also determine . Secondary analysis : Secondary analysis examine 12-week outcome within subgroup trial double-blind treatment duration least 12 week .</detailed_description>
