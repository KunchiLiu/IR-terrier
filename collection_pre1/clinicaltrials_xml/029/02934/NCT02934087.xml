	<brief_title>Endovascular Aneurysm Repair ( EVAR ) Gate Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Endografts currently FDA-approved abdominal aortic aneurysm ( AAA ) repair modular system , comprise main body ( Aortic Trunk ) two leg ( Ipsilateral Leg Endoprosthesis contralateral leg endoprosthesis ) . In placement endograft main body ipsilateral limb deploy retrograde common femoral artery approach . From contralateral femoral artery , cannulation contralateral gate require deploy contralateral iliac limb.Cannulation contralateral limb gate portion operation require `` wire skill . '' Depending patient ' body type , angulation aorta size volume AAA , portion procedure technically difficult . This portion may become lengthy discourage surgeon fails cannulate gate use particular approach . Cannulation contralateral limb gate retrograde femoral artery approach commonly achieve first use maneuverable guidewire steerable catheter . Antegrade crossover cannulation involve pass guidewire ipsilateral limb contralateral limb gate endograft , accomplish curve catheter . The wire may retrieve contralateral limb use snare device . The problem important -- difficulty access contralateral gate lead increase procedural time excess exposure radiation . The standard care retrograde cannulation use crossover snare technique secondary adjunct retrograde cannulation fail . In study compare retrograde cannulation primary snaring .</detailed_description>
