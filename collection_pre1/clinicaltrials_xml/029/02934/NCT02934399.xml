	<brief_summary>The study investigate 27 hour profile hormones subcutaneous tissue healthy subject patient Addison 's , Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia , Growth Hormone Deficiency , acromegaly , Cushings Primary Hyperaldosteronism conventional diagnostic therapeutic follow-up . The 27 hour monitoring ULTRADIAN take account rhythm hormone throughout day . It hop information may future improve simplify diagnostic procedure . Follow-up patient endocrinology still remain difficult include clinical sign under-treatment , questionnaires quality life blood test necessitate often retesting . Simplification diagnostic procedure obtain detailed knowledge rhythm hormone may contribute improvement individualization treatment may decrease morbidity mortality endocrine patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Microdialysis fluid collect participant use ULTRADIAN dynamic diagnostics system . This 3-component collection system easily attach belt allow participant continue normal everyday activity whilst undergo sampling . The micro-fractions minute , volume would normally far small use current immunoassay . ULTRADIAN overcome hurdle introduce two novel technique ; ultrasensitive liquid chromatography tandem mass spectroscopy ( LCMS/MS ) steroid hormone , proximity extension assay ( PEA® ) , allow simultaneous assay 96 analytes 1 µL fluid . The microdialysis sampling perform addition conventional diagnostic sampling , normal follow-up patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Healthy male female subject age 1868 year , nonsmoker regular smoker great 6 cigarette day , BMI 1629 Male female Cushing 's syndrome age 1868 year biochemically confirm base cortisol ACTH measurement , dexamethasone suppression test 1 follow positive investigation ( 24 hour urine cortisol , salivary/serum cortisol profile ) . Visible tumour pituitary and/or one follow positive test point pituitary source ACTH overproduction ( bilateral petrosal sinus sampling , corticotropin release hormone test , high dose dexamethasone suppression test ) adrenal tumour consider fit surgery . No contraceptives 6 week prior sample ( female ) . Patients medical therapy e.g . metyrapone Cushings 2 week washout treatment prior sample Male female age 18 68 year biochemically confirm adrenal insufficiency base basal cortisol ACTH measurement and/or Synacthen test +/ adrenal antibody , oral hydrocortisone cortisone acetate glucocorticoid replacement therapy Female age 1868 year biochemically confirm saltwasting simple virilise CAH base 17OHP , cortisol , androgen , renin ACTH measurement ; disease cause mutation CYP21A2 and/or synacthen test . Male female subject age 18 68 year biochemical confirmation PHA base valid pathological aldosterone/renin ratio nonsuppressible aldosterone level one currently use confirmatory test ( saline/oral fludrocortisone test ) . Unilateral diagnostic CT and/or adrenal vein sample Male female subject age 1868 year biochemically confirm GHD ( arginine growth hormone release hormone test , insulin tolerance test , know pituitary disease confirm pan hypopituitarism ) Male female age 1868 year biochemically confirm acromegaly ( oral glucose tolerance test GH day curve diagnostic insulin growth factor 1 level ) radiological evidence pituitary adenoma . Healthy control undergo plan pregnancy lactate woman . Presence unstable pathological condition past 3 month . On regular prescribed medication ( except contraception ) .
