	<brief_title>Pursed Lip Breathing Interstitial Lung Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The use purse lip breathing ( PLB ) improve exercise tolerance COPD patient widely document . However , efficacy patient interstitial lung disease ( ILD ) yet confirm . This study aim determine PLB improve perceive exertion exercise capacity six-minute walk test ( 6MWT ) patient ILD . To achieve , prospective randomize crossover trial perform , patient ILD restrictive ventilatory defect recruit via ILD clinic HÃ´pital Notre-Dame . The study perform single visit , day patient attend routine physician-prescribed follow-up 6MWT . Patients ask perform total two 6MWT . Patients randomize perform first test without use PLB , order reverse second test , patient serve control . During test , ventilatory variable continuously measure use portable metabolic cart . The observed parameter : perceive exertion use Modified-Borg Scale , respiratory rate , minute-ventilation , heart rate , peripheral oxygen saturation , 6-minute walk distance ( 6MWD ) . It expect use PLB associate decrease least one unit Modified Borg Scale , would clinically significant . Moreover , expect decrease dyspnea PLB relate decrease respiratory rate minute ventilation 6MWT . The clinical impact study could significant therapy allow improvement dyspnea patient ILD scarce .</detailed_description>
