	<brief_summary>The rapid age population mean anesthesiologist care elderly patient increase regularity . Although age independent predictor adverse postoperative outcome , significant outcome variation exist among old surgical patient . Frailty , syndrome describes aggregate susceptibility adverse health outcome due age- , disease-related deficit accumulate across multiple domain key predictor adverse postoperative outcome elderly patient . Frail surgical patient increase risk complication , institutionalization , death , high healthcare resource user . Multiple stakeholder , include anesthesiologist patient , identify improve outcome old patient preoperative exercise training ( prehabilitation ) 2 10 important area future perioperative research . Physical vulnerability important aspect frailty syndrome , may amenable structured exercise therapy . However , evidence preoperative exercise training ( prehabilitation ) improve postoperative outcome obscure methodological limitation focus non-elderly patient . Recently , evidence emerge old sicker patient may benefit prehab , however , hypothesis formally test . Because complex need frail perioperative patient require longitudinal multidisciplinary approach , investigator develop perioperative surgical home frail elderly ( PSH-Frail ) . Development PSH-Frail support robust data collection system , include linkage prospectively collect data health administrative data infrastructure improve efficiency long-term follow . The investigator hypothesize prehabilitation vital intervention support PSH frail , however , high quality evidence randomize trial need support efficacy . Therefore , investigator propose single center randomize controlled trial prehabilitation frail elderly patient elective abdominal thoracic cancer surgery improve postoperative function ( primary outcome ) , decrease postoperative resource utilization ( secondary outcome ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Prehabilitation Study : Exercise Before Surgery Improve Patient Function People</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Frailty key risk factor adverse outcome among increasingly large number old patient present surgery . The complexity risk profile frail patient make population may derive significant benefit multidisciplinary continuous care provide Perioperative Surgical Home ( PSH ) model care . Development evidence-based PSH frail elderly ( PSH-Frail ) overarch goal investigator 's research program . However , PSH-Frail complex intervention , require high quality evidence support inclusion specific process intervention overall framework . To date , investigator 's research group undertake prospective study support routine accurate identification frail patient surgery . The next step development PSH-Frail testing intervention improve outcomes frail elderly surgical patient . The role preoperative exercise training ( prehabilitation ) improve postoperative outcome priority research area perioperative medicine , may provide significant impact frail elderly patient . However , hypothesis formally test . Study design : A single center , parallel arm randomize controlled trial home-based prehabilitation vs. standard perioperative care frail elderly patient undergo elective surgery intraabdominal cancer conduct . This superiority trial test hypothesis home-based prehabilitation result improve postoperative functional outcome compare standard care . This protocol describe keep Standard Protocol Items : Recommendations Intervention Trials ( SPIRIT ) guideline ) . Study setting : This study perform The Ottawa Hospital ( TOH ) , 900-bed tertiary care academic health science center serve catchment area 1.2 million people . TOH regional cancer referral center Eastern portion Canadian province Ontario . On average , cancer patient see 4 week prior surgery ( provincial benchmark cancer care ) . Sample size : To detect clinically important 25 meter difference primary outcome study arm , use two-sided test 5 % level significance 80 % power , assume standard deviation 55 meter base previously publish trial , require 77 patient per arm . To account 20 % attrition enroll 100 patient per arm . Recruitment : Patients recruit investigator 's hospital 's Cancer Assessment Center . Following cancer diagnosis , patient see surgeon 4 week prior schedule operation . Following surgical assessment confirmation decision operate , patient consent consideration research contact , meet inclusion criterion except frailty score , assess trained clinician clinical assistant use Clinical Frailty Scale ( CFS ) . Patients score &gt; 4/9 CFS randomize provide write informed consent . Intervention : The intervention home-based total-body exercise training program ( henceforth refer prehabilitation ) base protocol prove efficacy improve function non-frail surgical patient le 4 week preoperative utilization . Prehabilitation consist 3 component : 1 ) strength training ; 2 ) aerobic exercise 3 ) flexibility . Prehabilitation prescribe 1-hour session perform minimum 3 time per week . Control : Patients randomize control group provide standard perioperative care per institutional standard . Patients receive World Health Organization ( WHO ) Global Recommendations Physical Activity Health people 65 year pamphlet , well Canada 's Food Guide . In-hospital perioperative care , postoperative care , discretion patient 's surgeon anesthesiologist .</detailed_description>
