	<brief_title>Identification Risk Factors Causing Difficulty Laryngeal Mask Insertion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Backgrounds Since introduction clinical practice 1983 , laryngeal mask ( LM ) find role daily practice anesthesiologist , include use primary device airway management elective emergency emergency approach management difficult airway . Moreover , insertion LM become common technique management airway , particular outpatient surgery , associate short recovery time , faster discharge thus reduction cost . Even LM consider device safe low incidence complication , may situations difficult insert . Aim study Some study concern cause determine difficulty insertion LM . They retrospective study and/or focused analysis single type device . Therefore , seem appropriate carry prospective observational study identify weight risk factor relate position LM purpose identification prediction . Methods From read literature opinion expert extensive practice airway management ( part Working Group `` Management Airway '' Italian Society Anaesthesia , Analgesia , Resuscitation Intensive Care SIAARTI ) possible cause difficulty insertion laryngeal mask identify ; possible cause list report distribute center enrol conduction study . The center select base fact researcher include anesthesiologist part Working Group `` Airway management '' SIAARTI act supervisor . Statistic Descriptive : quantitative variable report mean , standard deviation , first third quartile , median , minimum maximum . For qualitative variable report frequency percentage category . Explorative : The association risk factor proportion incorrect insertion evaluate univariate analysis , use relative risk confidence interval . Sample size : For hypothesis test relative risk specify H0 : RR â‰¤ 1 H1 : RR &gt; 1 consider expect relative risk 2 , proportion 2.9 % failure group expert first type error equal 5 % , 832 patient per group need ensure power equal 90 % . The limit significance set 5 % . Expected result To calculate relative risk factor analyze order identify , view LM positioning , modify reduce risk failure , secondly , identify risk factor whose presence may contraindicate use device indicate use alternative method airway management .</detailed_description>
