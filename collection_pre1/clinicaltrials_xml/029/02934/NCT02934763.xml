	<brief_summary>Opioid Induced Hyperalgesia ( OIH ) entity demonstrate healthy volunteer animal model . Is defined increase perception painful stimulus , increase opioid requirement diminish pain threshold stimuli . The apparition OIH also relate exposure opioids surgery , depend dose , time exposition type opioid . This condition modulate , specially perioperative context . It see healthy volunteer animal model , use propranolol modulate phenomenon , diminish postoperative requirement analgesia . It also unknown , dose propranolol require modulate adequately OIH . The objective work evaluate efficacy propranolol modulation opioid induce hyperalgesia , low postoperative requirement analgesia rescue .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Opioid Induced Hyperalgesia ( OIH ) Modulation With Propranolol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize control study , compare 2 intervention placebo . The intervention use propranolol , different dos , achieve specific plasmatic concentration . 80 patient require find difference 20 % primary outcome . The primary outcome measure postoperative use opioids post anesthesic care unit . Secondary outcome , amount opioids use follow 24 hour surgery , time first dose analgesia post anesthesic care unit , change pain threshold , evaluate pain pressure tactile sensitivity , surgery . Also , secondary outcome , group receive study drug , evaluate temporal change opioid induced hyperalgesia , pain sensitivity measure postoperative hour 2 , 4 24 . 10 patient receive placebo part additional measure .</detailed_description>
