	<brief_summary>This study conduct establish relative bioavailability budesonide formoterol deliver via Symbicort pressurize metered-dose inhaler ( pMDI ) without spacer device . Administration condition occur concomitant administration activate charcoal estimate exposure lung without activated charcoal estimate total systemic exposure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Assess How Much Drug Reaches Blood When Given From Symbicort pMDI With Spacer Compared That Symbicort pMDI Without Spacer Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design : This study randomise , open-label , single-dose , crossover study healthy subject ( male female ) , perform single study centre . The study comprise : - A screening period maximum 28 day ; - Four treatment period subject resident afternoon dose Symbicort least 24 hour dose ; discharge morning Day 2 ; - A final visit within 5 7 day last administration Symbicort . There minimum washout period 3 day dose administration Symbicort . Subjects receive single dos Symbicort 4 occasion fast condition . During screening , spirometry test perform technologist qualified designee ensure subject perform adequate manoeuvre achieve optimal lung function . Device inhalation training conduct admission treatment period , prior dose Day 1 treatment period . Duration : Approximately 7 week Statistical Analysis : - For total systemic exposure : Treatment B versus Treatment A - For lung exposure : Treatment D versus Treatment C Treatment ratio assess ratio log-transformed Cmax , AUC0-t AUC budesonide formoterol use 2-sided 90 % confidence interval ( CI ) approach base repeated measure analysis variance ( ANOVA ) model include period treatment fixed effect , subject random effect . The estimated treatment difference 90 % CIs log scale back-transformed obtain Gmean ratio pair treatment . The least square mean ( 95 % CIs ) , Gmean ratios 90 % CIs tabulate comparison analyte ( budesonide formoterol ) . Sample Size : The sample size 56 ensure adequate number subject randomise least 44 evaluable subject complete study . Assuming intra-subject coefficient variation ( CV ) 33 % ( base variability AUC0-12 budesonide AUC0-12 Cmax formoterol observe similarly design crossover study healthy adult ) , 44 evaluable subject give least 80 % power show 90 % CI treatment effect lie entirely within range 0.8 1.25 , i.e. , would rule 20 % change ( log scale ) exposure budesonide formoterol .</detailed_description>
