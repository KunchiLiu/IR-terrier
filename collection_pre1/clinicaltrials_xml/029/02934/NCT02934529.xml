	<brief_summary>The FIRE-4 study aim define treatment concept patient RAS wild-type tumour , optimise regard overall survival . The first-line treatment conduct FOLFIRI plus cetuximab , result significantly prolong overall survival versus bevacizumab FIRE-3 study . Following initial progression ( PD1 ) recommend treatment continue FOLFOX plus bevacizumab , concept lead significantly prolong survival E3200 study . Owing encouraging result Santini study , cetuximab rechallenge combination irinotecan-based chemotherapy perform part third-line treatment patient show response define accord RECIST 1.1 first-line treatment ( tumour diameter &lt; -30 % ) present stable tumour disease least 6 month ( tumour diameter +20 -30 % ) . The concept ideal sequence yet study date clinical trial .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study begin FPFV : ( first study visit first patient , sign declaration consent participate study ) : schedule 4th quarter 2014 Patient recruitment : 36 month Treatment duration per patient : Until time progression third-line treatment late . Anticipated individual duration treatment : 24 month ( patient undergo three treatment line -included part 1 ) , 6 month patient receive third line treatment ( include directly part 2 ) Duration follow-up end treatment : For patient , death least 1 year follow final termination study treatment regardless treatment line . In , follow-up period patient include part 1 study conduct maximum 5 year time randomisation 1 ; patient include part 2 study ( third-line treatment ) , maximum 3 year date randomisation 2 . End study : last follow-up visit last study patient schedule 4th quarter 2020</detailed_description>
