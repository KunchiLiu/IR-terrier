	<detailed_description>Current standard patient monitoring acute care intensive care unit ( ICU ) , operate room ( OR ) emergency room ( ER ) use expensive , bulky uncomfortable monitor . Unfortunately , discharge acute care set transfer general division example ( low acuity ) , patient leave manual measurement vital sign every 4 6 hour , depend available resource nursing . Furthermore , measurement reflect result time measurement take ( spot check ) . The combination manual spot check lack innovative medical technology 60 % hospital care setting ( non-ICUs non-OR ) represent important limitation patient follow-up , associated risk cost . In particular , refer monitor blood pressure ( BP ) , current monitoring practice relies use occlusive pneumatic cuff inflate around arm . Based oscillometric technique , occlusive cuff uncomfortable , provide intermittent measurement , inability provide full view BP regulation landscape . Therefore , un-detected hypertensive event omit , put patient risk . The continuous , comfortable portable measurement BP low acuity hospital department major unsolved problem modern healthcare system regard patient monitoring safety . Winmedical ( device manufacturer ) commercialize wearable multi-parametric modular medical system , WinPack , deliver continuous real-time monitoring record vital sign , electrocardiography ( ECG ) , respiration rate , BP , blood oxygen saturation , body temperature , posture , low-acuity department increase overall clinical performance . A new algorithm process raw physiological signal acquire WinPack provide accurate continuous BP measurement test .</detailed_description>
