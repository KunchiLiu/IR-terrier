	<brief_summary>This observational study compare outcomes prospectively-enrolled cohort Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant ( HCT ) recipients outcomes cohort age-matched historical non-HCT control . Patients undergo alloHCT receive HCT US transplant center report Center International Blood Marrow Transplant Research ( CIBMTR ) use well-established CIBMTR report form data collection procedure well study-specific supplemental form . Data historical non-HCT control collect 14 US academic center . These center provide data consecutive patient PMF , post-ET MF , post-PV MF refer institution 2000 2012 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Assessment Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Patients With Myelofibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients primary MF ( PMF ) , post-essential thrombocythemia ( ET ) MF , post-polycythemia vera ( PV ) MF , intermediate-2 high-risk disease determine DIPSS , age ≥55 time DIPSS assessment eligible study . For allogeneic HCT arm HLA-Matched Donor HCT Study , donor must either 6/6 HLA-matched related donor , define Class I ( HLA-A -B ) intermediate resolution high resolution DNA-based type Class II ( HLA-DRBI ) high resolution DNA-based typing ( monozygotic twin ) , OR 8/8 HLA-A , -B , -C , -DRB1 high resolution DNA-based typing match unrelated donor ; peripheral blood stem cell bone marrow graft allow , condition regimen intensity graph versus host disease ( GVHD ) prophylaxis regimens allow . For Haploidentical Donor Study , donor must haploidentical . This study target accrual 650 patient receive alloHCT , include approximately 225 receive myeloablative conditioning . Participating center expect provide data approximately 2,400 patient form non-HCT historical control cohort .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients fulfil follow criterion eligible inclusion study : PMF , postET MF , postPV MF . Int2 highrisk disease determine DIPSS . Age ≥55 time DIPSS assessment . For alloHCT arm : Donors must 6/6 HLAmatched related donor , define Class I ( HLAA B ) intermediate resolution high resolution DNAbased type Class II ( HLADRBI ) high resolution DNAbased typing ( monozygotic twin ) OR 8/8 HLAA , B , C , DRB1 high resolution DNAbased type match unrelated donor identify National Marrow Donor Program ( NMDP ) /Be The Match . Donors must meet institutional NMDP/Be The Match selection criterion ; age restriction sibling donor . Both peripheral blood stem cell bone marrow graft allow . All condition regimen intensity allow . All GVHD prophylaxis regimens allow . Haploidentical donor allow Haploidentical Donor Study Patients follow criterion ineligible entry study : AlloHCT use umbilical cord blood unit ( ) HLAmismatched adult donor ( &lt; 6/6 HLA allele relate &lt; 8/8 HLA allele unrelated ) .
