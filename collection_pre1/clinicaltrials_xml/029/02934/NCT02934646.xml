	<brief_summary>This phase-II clinical study ass whether intense passive mobilization elbow early stage effective preventing spasticity occur later stage . A group subacute stroke patient treated device name NEUROExos Elbow Module ( NEEM ) daily basis , addition traditional physical therapy . The outcome assess term ( ) system safety , ( ii ) system usability ( iii ) treatment efficacy . Investigators expect intense therapy perform sub-acute phase follow stroke would effective prevent elbow spasticity occur later stage ( i.e . 3-4 month stroke ) , latter quantify mean Modified Ashworth Scale ( MAS ) . Similarly phase-II study field post-stroke rehabilitation , present study include one group patient . As secondary objective , similarly study robot-assisted therapy , investigator wiil test ability system use assess rehabilitation outcome . Investigators introduce novel evaluation metric base kinematics kinetics variable record NEEM compare MAS value .</brief_summary>
