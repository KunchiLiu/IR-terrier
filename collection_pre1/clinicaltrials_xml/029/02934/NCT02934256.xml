	<brief_title>Icotinib Study Patients With Neurofibromatosis Type 2 ( NF2 ) NF2-Related Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neurofibromatosis type 2 ( NF2 ) hereditary tumor predisposition syndrome cause mutation NF2 tumor suppressor gene . Individuals NF2 high likelihood develop multiple nervous system tumor , include schwannomas , meningioma , ependymomas . The hallmark NF2 bilateral vestibular schwannomas . Historically , NF2 patient experience complete hearing loss either tumor progression treatment tumor surgery radiation . Effective treatment urgently need NF2 patient progressive hearing loss hearing loss associate impairment social , emotional , communication function increase depression . Previous study NF2 patient treat Erlotinib suggest inhibition epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) could result hear improvement reduction tumor size . Much evidence implicates human epidermal growth factor ( HER ) receptor vestibular schwannoma growth.Some study demonstrate Merlin , NF2 gene protein product , control surface availability EGFR , ErbB2 , ErbB3 receptor human Drosophila model . Besides , cell culture model mouse embryo fibroblast ( MEFs ) support role EGFR NF2-associated tumorigenesis . Nf2-deficient cell culture lack contact-dependent inhibition growth continue grow confluent culture . This effect appear mediate EGFR signal . Treatment Nf2-deficient cell EGFR inhibitor gefitinib restore contact-dependent inhibition , suggest class drug might useful NF2 patient progressive vestibular schwannomas . In way , Icotinib inhibit nutrition tumor decrease tumor 's growth metastasis . Based study , perform clinical trial know treatment effect tolerability Icotinib NF2 .</detailed_description>
