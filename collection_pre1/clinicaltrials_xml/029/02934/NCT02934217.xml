	<brief_summary>Infarct size major determinant vital prognosis AMI . We recently report cyclosporine A , administer immediately prior PCI reperfusion , significantly reduce infarct size STEMI patient . The CIRCUS study aim determine impact cyclosporine combine incidence ( death , hospitalization heart failure , LV remodelling ) one year AMI . However , many patient may display increased adverse LV remodelling beyond year 1 develop heart failure thereafter . The present CIRCUS II trial aim examine 3-year clinical outcome patient recruit CIRCUS study .</brief_summary>
