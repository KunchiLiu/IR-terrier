	<brief_title>Study Pembrolizumab Chemotherapy With Without Radiation Small Cell Lung Cancer ( SCLC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SCLC provide opportune set evaluate potential importance variability PD-L1 expression influence optimize time efficacy checkpoint inhibition . All extensive stage SCLC patient treat chemotherapy recent data suggest added benefit consolidation thoracic radiation . A prior study patient know PD-L1 expression show 35 % response rate . That study use archival specimens find 29 % PD-L1 positivity rate ( 1 % level ) suggest expression level prevalence could higher ( response rate/outcome therefore potentially good ) patient previously chemotherapy radiation . The propose study seek evaluate pembrolizumab therapy initiate different time course SCLC treatment : ) front , conjunction initiation chemotherapy , b ) start one cycle chemotherapy , c ) start completion 1st line chemotherapy ( 4-6 cycle ) , ) start completion consolidation thoracic radiation therapy and/or prophylactic cranial irradiation ( PCI ) . Treatment pembrolizumab precede biopsy evaluation PD-L1 expression correlative evaluation change PD-L1 expression ( relative diagnostic biopsy ) change tissue- blood-based biomarkers immune marker .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must histologically confirm small cell lung carcinoma amenable initial concurrent radiotherapy ( extensivestage disease ) . Participants may evaluable measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record nonnodal lesion short axis nodal lesion ) ≥20 mm conventional technique ≥10 mm spiral CT scan , MRI , caliper clinical exam . Participants cohort B must complete 1 cycle systemic chemotherapy . Therapy combination must start sooner 3 week last dose chemotherapy later 5 week last dose chemotherapy . Participants cohort B must progression disease prior start therapy . Participants cohort C must complete systemic therapy ( 46 cycle cisplatin carboplatin + etoposides ) NOT candidate consolidation thoracic radiotherapy PCI . Participants cohort C must initiate therapy pembrolizumab within 6 week last dose chemotherapy ( therapy must start within 2 week last dose ) . Participants cohort C must progression disease prior start therapy . Participants cohort D must complete systemic therapy AND complete either consolidation thoracic radiotherapy PCI complete either consolidation thoracic radiotherapy PCI . Participants cohort D must initiate therapy pembrolizumab within 6 week last dose radiation . Therapy must start within 2 week last dose . Consolidation radiotherapy dose must NOT 3000 centigray ( cGy ) . Participants cohort D must progression disease prior start therapy . Age &gt; 18 year . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ≤2 ( Karnofsky ≥60 % ) Life expectancy great 3 month Participants must normal organ marrow function screen Cycle 1 , day 1 define . * Adequate Organ Function Laboratory Values System Laboratory Value Hematological Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥1,500 /microliter ( mcL ) Platelets ≥100,000 / mcL Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL ≥5.6 mmol/L without transfusion erythropoietin ( EPO ) dependency ( within 7 day assessment ) Renal Serum creatinine OR Measured ≤1.5 X upper limit normal ( ULN ) OR calculate creatinine ≥60 mL/min subject creatinine clearance ( GFR also use level &gt; 1.5X institutional ULN place creatinine CrCl ) Hepatic Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X ULN OR Direct bilirubin ≤ ULN subject total bilirubin level &gt; 1.5 ULN AST ( SGOT ) Alanine transaminase ( ALT ) ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 X ULN OR ≤ 5 X ULN subject liver metastasis Albumin &gt; 2.5 mg/dL Coagulation International Normalized Ratio ≤1.5 X ULN unless subject receiving ( INR ) Prothrombin Time ( PT ) anticoagulant therapy long PT PTT within therapeutic range intend use anticoagulant Activated Partial Thromboplastin ≤1.5 X ULN unless subject receiving Time ( aPTT ) anticoagulant therapy long PT PTT within therapeutic range intend use anticoagulant . Availability diagnostic prechemotherapy tissue biopsy require ( cytologic specimens bone biopsy accept ) . This biopsy must within 6 week start initial therapy . A minimum 205 μm slide block require . Participants cohorts BD must willing provide tissue newly obtain core excisional biopsy tumor lesion . Newlyobtained defined specimen within 4 week initiation treatment AFTER last dose prior therapy . Participants treat brain metastasis allow . Radiation must complete least 2 week prior pembrolizumab dose participant must require ongoing steroid . Participants untreated brain metastasis &lt; 5 mm clinical symptom vasogenic edema may allow study casebycase basis discussion sponsor . These participant require MRI monitoring every 6 week ensure stability . The effect pembrolizumab develop human fetus unknown .

Subjects childbearing potential surgically sterilize free menses &gt; 1 year . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Men treat enrol protocol must also agree use adequate contraception prior study , duration study participation , 4 month completion chemotherapy , radiation , pembrolizumab administration . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Participants cohort A may prior therapy disease .
