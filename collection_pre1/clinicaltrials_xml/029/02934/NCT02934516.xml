	<brief_title>Push With Lower Uterine Segment Support</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obstructed labor refers failure labor progress spite good uterine contraction attribute mismatch size present part fetus mother 's pelvis . Approximately 8 % maternal death worldwide attribute obstructed labor subsequent puerperal infection , uterine rupture , postpartum hemorrhage . In situation , Cesarean section could minimize maternal neonatal morbidity . However , Cesarean section challenge head deeply impact associate high risk maternal injury perinatal injury . The common complication extension uterine incision could involve vagina , bladder , ureter broad ligament . Neonates also risk skull fracture , cephalhematoma , subgaleal hematoma mainly due manipulation . Currently , popular approach fetal head delivery push pull method . Although push method seem convenient necessitate extensive experience , significantly associate extension pull method . Although pull method seem safe , difficult perform usually warrant aggressive uterine incision deliver fetus . In 2013 , investigator publish case series abdominal disimpaction lower uterine segment support basically allow obstetrician deliver fetal head transverse uterine incision minimal risk extension neonatal complication . In study , investigator aim validate approach comparison classic push method .</detailed_description>
