	<brief_title>Circulating Cell-free Tumor DNA ( ctDNA ) Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In formation growth primary tumor , cell release bloodstream . There many research circulate tumor cell ( CTC ) And recently circulate cell-free tumor DNA ( ctDNA ) release apoptotic necrotic tumor cell develop . At one report check ctDNA level operation colon cancer patient , suggest ctDNA could show recurrence cancer several month earlier conventional follow imaging . And several report suggest ctDNA invade host cell change host cell biology , evoke cancer metastasis . So study , collect ctDNA pancreatic cancer patient underwent operation , evaluate whether peripheral ctDNA help early screen cancer recurrence . And study genomic signature ctDNA evaluate relationship ctDNA clinical outcome cancer patient .</detailed_description>
