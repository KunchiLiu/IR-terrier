	<brief_summary>Determine brexpiprazole treatment associate dose-dependent reduction rest pupil diameter reflection locus coeruleus ( LC ) norepinephrine ( NE ) neuron target engagement group subject PTSD . All subject evaluate physical examination , ECG , standard blood chemistry , hematologic lab , toxicology testing , urinalysis . Results study must demonstrate lack clinically significant abnormality prior enrollment . Subjects need satisfy DSM-5 criterion PTSD receive CAPS-5 score 40 great test study enrollment . Resting pupil diameter pupillometric evaluation two week treatment serve primary outcome measure . This compare treatment group use mixed effect repeat measure model evaluate significant difference pupil size among treatment study . As secondary analysis approach use evaluate whether treatment effect total CAPS-5 score . Lastly , investigator compute correlation pupil size CAPS-5 score .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Dose-Response Biomarker Study Brexpiprazole Treatment PTSD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Hypothesis : Brexpiprazole treatment associate dose-dependent reduction rest pupil diameter reflection LC NE neuron target engagement group subject PTSD . Secondary Hypothesis : Brexpiprazole therapy associate dosedependent decrease CAPS-5 score Tertiary Hypothesis : The pre-post treatment change rest pupil diameter statistically significantly correlate pre-post change CAPS-5 score . Subjects screen undergo pupil measure rating scale Visit 1 . Subject must free psychotropic medication one week Day 1 assessment , except prior FLX treatment require 4 week abstinence , MAOIs require 2 week abstinence . They randomize study drug issue six week study medication Day 1 take home . A phone call occur safety assessment medication adherence every week . They present back study site Day 42 undergo pupil measure rating scale . They undergo one week washout period . On Day 49 give another study drug take home rating scale pupil measure obtain day . A phone call occur safety assessment medication adherence every week . They present back study site Day 91 undergo pupil measure rating scale . They undergo one week washout period . On Day 98 give another study drug take home rating scale pupil measure obtain day . A phone call occur safety assessment medication adherence every week . They present back study site Day 140 undergo pupil measure rating scale . No study medication provide Day 140 final visit schedule Day 147 , one week later , end study interview labs physical exam . At visit , final visit , subject complete CAPS-5 , MADRS , Insomnia Severity Index , Clinician Assessment Adverse Effects .</detailed_description>
