	<detailed_description>Children DCD randomly split either QET group technical training ( TT ) . The TT group give movement-related instruction via video , relate throw catch phase , QET group also teach fixate target location wall prior throw ( QE1 ) track ball prior catch ( QE2 ) . Each group take part 4- week , group therapy intervention measurement QE duration obtain mobile eye track system catch performance take training , 6-week delay retention test . Parental feedback psychosocial motor skill outcomes also collect delayed retention .</detailed_description>
