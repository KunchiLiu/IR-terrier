	<brief_summary>This study aim identify predictor suicidal behavior depress subject . Investigators first compare demographic , clinical , biological feature depress recent suicide attempter ( within one week ) depress subject without lifetime history suicide attempt . Baseline risk factor suicide use predict risk attempt suicide one year follow-up . A thorough evaluation patient allow identify factor associate suicidal risk develop simplify risk score could use clinical setting improve practice .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Predictors Suicidal Behavior Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background rationale : Suicidal behavior ( SB ) major health problem France , 10,000 suicide ( 6th UE28 ) 220 000 suicide attempt ( SA ) per year . A large percentage men ( 6 % ) woman ( 9 % ) France make least one SA . Moreover , suicide second lead cause death among young ( 15-44 year ) . The clinical model currently admit understand SB stress vulnerability model . But date , scientist ( yet ) clinical application research SB . The management psychiatric patient , include depressed subject , face impossibility detect high risk occurrence SB . Indeed , although many risk factor SB know , predictive value low . In addition , risk factor primarily derive cross-sectional study . The identification predictor , use standardized evaluation would allow clinician identify subject high risk SB therapeutic intervention organization care particularly aggressive intensive . Objectives : Main objective : To identify predictor ( clinical , biological , environmental ) occurrence SB 12 month population depress suicide attempter lifetime non attempter optimize short standardized evaluation applicable emergency setting . Secondary objective : 1 ) To build multidimensional score predict risk recurrence suicide attempt among suicide attempter ; 2 ) To evaluate prospective performance score predict emergence suicide attempt among depressed patient without history suicide attempt ; 3 ) To identify predictor suicidal spectrum ( suicidal thought , suicidal planification , suicide attempt complete suicide ) depress subject ; 4 ) To evaluate feasibility multicenter network use standardize assessment evaluate suicidal risk secure website . Methods : 2000 patient major depressive episode recruit emergency department post-acute care unit 14 French hospital , follow 12 month . For every depressed patient admit within 48 hour suicide attempt ( case ) , depressed patient without lifetime personal history SB ( psychiatric control ) include . Cases mainly recruit emergency setting ; psychiatric control mainly recruit inpatient unit ( hospital stay &lt; 7 day ) outpatient unit limit selection bias . At inclusion , 3 , 6 12 month , clinical biological assessment ne realize . Statistical analysis : 1 ) Kaplan-Meier Cox model adjust potential confounding factor , 2 ) Univariate multivariate analysis , 3 ) Establishment predictive score multivariate analysis . Short-term perspective : 1 ) Optimization standardize assessment suicidal risk depress patient applicable daily practice , 2 ) Development network clinical center involve suicidology field promote specific care research . Long-term perspective : 1 ) Access computerized assessment tool via Internet improve management depressed patient France 2 ) Understanding psychological biological factor underlie SB context mood disorder , 3 ) Development preventive therapeutic approach .</detailed_description>
