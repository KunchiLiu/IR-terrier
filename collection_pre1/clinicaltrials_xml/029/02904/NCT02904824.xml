	<brief_summary>This first Development Safety Update Report prepare Phase I-IIA Clinical Trial- FIBHGM-ECNC007-2010 ( PHASE I / IIA CLINICAL TRIAL , UNICENTRIC , RANDOMIZED , CONTROLLED , TWO PARALLEL-GROUPS , TO EVALUATE THE SAFETY OF A NEW THERAPY WITH STEM CELLS DERIVED FROM ADIPOSE TISSUE FOR GLOTTAL GAP ( GG ) IN THE UNILATERAL PARALYSIS OF THE VOCAL CORD ( VC ) ) International Conference Harmonization ( ICH ) . Patients randomize receive one follow therapeutic strategy : Group A : Autologous Fat process centrifugation fill paralyze vocal cord . Group B : Autologous Fat enrich stem cell adipose tissue treat vocal cord paralysis . Active control : Autologous fat tissue process centrifugation . Route administration : Injection paralyze vocal cord . Experimental drug : Stem cell autologous adipose tissue autologous tissue enrich suspension fill paralyze vocal cord . The aim induce overexpression production microvessels local level . Route administration : injection thickness paralyze vocal cord .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This first Development Safety Update Report prepare Phase I-IIA Clinical Trial- FIBHGM-ECNC007-2010 ( PHASE I / IIA CLINICAL TRIAL , UNICENTRIC , RANDOMIZED , CONTROLLED , TWO PARALLEL-GROUPS , TO EVALUATE THE SAFETY OF A NEW THERAPY WITH STEM CELLS DERIVED FROM ADIPOSE TISSUE FOR GLOTTAL GAP IN THE UNILATERAL PARALYSIS OF THE VOCAL CORD International Conference Harmonization ( ICH ) E2F format . This trial contain relevant safety information report interval 08 July 2012 30 Sep 2014 This phase I / IIA clinical trial conduct evaluate safety ADRCs . This new therapy perform induce overexpression production microvessels paralyze vocal cord , permanently increase volume thus facilitate GG closure . In paralysis VC increase glottal gap occur lead dysphonia aspiration food , foreign body ... The creation new blood vessel , action stem cell derive adipose tissue , may produce great volume paralyze vocal cord allow GG closure easily . Patients include clinical trial require treatment unilateral vocal cord paralysis . It consider regard authorise protocol glottal GAP require intracordal injection increase volume glottal closureÂ·during phonation insufficient lack compensation contralateral vocal cord . Patients randomize receive one follow therapeutic strategy : Group A : Autologous Fat process centrifugation fill paralyze vocal cord , use . Group B : Autologous Fat enrich stem cell adipose tissue treat vocal cord paralysis . Active control : Autologous fat tissue process centrifugation . Route administration : Injection inside paralyzed vocal cord . Experimental drug : Stem cell autologous adipose tissue autologous tissue enrich suspension fill paralyze vocal cord . The aim induce overexpression production microvessels local level . Route administration : injection thickness paralyze vocal cord . In patient assigned ADRC group therapy , two surgical intervention perform day , randomize , visit 0 accord protocol . For group assign control ( autologous adipose tissue ) , therapy perform single surgical intervention , randomize , visit 0 accord protocol . The patient include followed six month implant .</detailed_description>
