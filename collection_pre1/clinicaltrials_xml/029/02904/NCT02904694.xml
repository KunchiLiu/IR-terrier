	<brief_summary>A national database set-up collate clinical outcome information child undergo Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy ( SDR ) . SDR surgical procedure use many year routinely available within United Kingdom National Health Service ( NHS ) . The SDR procedure use improve spasticity child cerebral palsy involve divide nerve fibre run muscle back spinal cord . While believe SDR effective , definitive data . In July 2014 NHS England commission five NHS Trusts undertake SDR surgery eligible child two-year period , collect detailed information outcome . The proposed database aggregate data five centre analyse provide overall evidence clinical effectiveness SDR . This information use inform future commission decision . The database develop King 's Technology Evaluation Centre ( KiTEC ) conjunction NHS England national clinical SDR steer committee data subcommittee . KiTEC undertakes research evaluation National Institute Health Care Excellence ( NICE ) , commission NICE undertake work . Clinicians SDR data subgroup liaise closely KiTEC agree data collect least amount need standardised format across centre . When two-year outcome data record , KiTEC analyse data present report NHS England , NICE SDR steer committee data sub-group . While firm plan follow child beyond two year post-surgery , party involve hop funding obtain continue follow child data unique .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy ( SDR ) Database</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Disease overview : Cerebral Palsy all-encompassing term numerous neurological condition cause problem brain nervous system . More specifically , cerebral palsy relate problem muscle movement , result abnormality walk , posture , balance . Other important function also affect , language/communication , learning , vision . There currently cure cerebral palsy ; however , several treatment option aid alleviation symptom improve quality life . The selection appropriate treatment ( ) child require input multi-disciplinary team health professional , paediatrician , social worker , physiotherapist , speech language therapist , occupational therapist , neurologist surgeon . Treatment overview : The National Institute Health Care Excellence ( NICE ) publish guidance relate treatment option cerebral palsy 2012 ( CG145 ) . One treatment option discuss Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy ( SDR ) . SDR irreversible surgical procedure , involve division sensory nerve spinal cord order reduce sensory input sensory-motor reflex arc . Intensive physiotherapy require SDR post surgery 24 month achieve outcome goal improvement muscle function , tone , quality life . NICE CG145 recommend consideration SDR child GMFCS level II III . This recommendation base review evidence evaluation , conclude reasonable evidence SDR combine appropriate post-operative treatment result significant improvement motor function quality life . Study Overview : This current project commission NICE support NHS England Commissioning Evaluation ( CTE ) approach . CTE launch September 2013 involve fund medical treatment technology routinely commission within NHS . SDR one procedure select CTE , aim evaluate 'outcome SDR demonstrate improvement function SDR 6 month maintain improved 12 month two year post operation ' . As part programme , NICE commission , early 2014 , data collection register development service one External Assessment Centres ( EACs ) : King 's Imaging Technology Evaluation Centre ( KiTEC ) . The key objective KiTEC EAC collect SDR relate data inform clinical effectiveness outcomes interest NHS England make commission plan address follow research question section 4.5 CG145 : 'Does selective dorsal rhizotomy follow intensive rehabilitation perform age 3 9 year child GMFCS level II III result good community mobility young adult ? ' Study Design : This multi-centre national database ( register ) project obtain evidence relate SDR address research question section 4.5 CG145 inform clinical effectiveness outcomes interest NHS England . All patient undergo pre-assessment prior undergoing SDR . This vary centre , anywhere 6 month prior SDR . Hospital admission SDR usually 1-2 week . Post-SDR follow-up conduct two year purpose project . All patient ' follow two year post-SDR member relevant clinical team . Post-SDR discharge three main data collection point purpose project : 6 , 12 24 month post-SDR . Patient data collect various time-points , agree EAC various SDR subgroup member . Pre-assessments may split one appointment , depend particular patient care pathway participate centre . Parents patient approach SDR clinical team attend first pre-SDR clinic visit . It explain parent child hospital make clinical assessment SDR enable provide optimum care evaluate success operation post-operative rehabilitation . These assessment along patient-reported outcome , quality life assessment , standardise across five commissioned hospital . The parent child ask permission add data national database facilitate aggregation result across United Kingdom ( UK ) . Study information sheet provide . If agree take part , parent sign consent form 2nd pre-SDR visit . This allow time consider whether wish take part . Centre Subject Compliance : Centre compliance refers centre provide agree standardised dataset input standardise database per CTE selection criterion . The EAC regularly monitor Centre compliance liaison NHS England include table compliance project report . The project report ( potential interim analysis ) include table number eligible patient refer treatment multi-disciplinary team process consent part database well actually register SDR database . The project report ( potential interim analysis ) list percentage miss data clinical domain differentiate baseline follow-up variable . Depending stage database table depict number child lose follow include project report potential interim analysis report . The SDR centre give regular report quality data term miss variable possible outlier . Statistical Considerations : The EAC statistician carry analysis . All data obtain analysed regular specify time point inform ongoing assessment clinical effectiveness , relevant outcome assessment overall research question.The SDR database expect small number , region n=120 year England . A range clinical patient-reported outcome record single primary secondary outcome . Rather aim describe quantify change number important clinical domain spasticity , function , range motion , gait quality life . Ethical Considerations : As database constitute research involve human subject , follow ethical consideration arise : - Parental consent require add child 's data national database patient information sheet ( PIS ) develop child parent potential child designate SDR centre . - Only minimum number data item need meet objective database comply ethical regulatory requirement include final dataset . - Children 's confidentiality protect data collection handle thus reduce risk disclosure .</detailed_description>
