	<brief_summary>To address challenge isolate analyze rare cell , study aim validate instrumentation , test protocol , analysis patient 's outcome show instrument 's capability reproducibly accurately detect CTCs cancer patient . In order facilitate validation process , investigator focus metastatic patient CTCs supposedly present high abundance . Investigators propose enroll cohort metastatic breast cancer patient . Blood sample collect patient start new line therapy determine doctor . The specific aim isolate , enumerate analyze number and/or molecular information circulate tumor cell patient blood use microfluidic chip-based sorting , imaging , molecular profiling technique . Investigators use study optimize diagnostic instrumentation , test blood processing protocol CTC analysis algorithm . During study investigator collect patient ' clinical information relate cancer , well patient ' survival status validate system 's prognosis ability .</brief_summary>
