	<brief_summary>With increase number advance surgical operation do annually , include elderly , risk develop postoperative delirium potentially high . Postoperative delirium associate longer hospital stay , poor functional outcome , cognitive decline elevate morbidity mortality , addition increase cost health care . However , study postoperative delirium do high income country , leave paucity literature incidence associate factor postoperative delirium Africa hence need study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Incidence Perioperative Factors Associated With Postoperative Delirium</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The paucity literature low income setting regard complication post operative delirium lead recognition diagnosis problem.The lack diagnostic tool , CAM , contribute low rate diagnosis index suspicion among clinician . Objectives To determine incidence perioperative factor associate postoperative delirium adult patient undergo elective surgery Mulago National Referral Hospital ( MNRH ) Procedure Patient recruitment Patients stratify ward systematic sampling use sample interval 3 . On day recruitment , first 3 patient theatre list particular ward select write number 1 3 piece paper randomly select one ; number select would first enrol , succeed every 3rd patient theatre list day . Written inform consent obtain preoperatively study patient . Preoperative assessment Trained research assistant conduct preoperative interview questionnaire within 12 hour surgery . Patient demographic , pain score , Glasgow coma score , smoke history , alcohol consumption , anaesthetic history , American Society Anaesthesiologists ( ASA ) , Class record anaesthetic chart , vitals laboratory result complete blood count , renal liver functional test available record . Delirium assessment To determine presence delirium , research assistant conduct structured interview preoperatively first three postoperative day hour 9am 12 pm , use Confusion Assessment Method ( CAM ) . Based structured interview , CAM algorithm include four clinical criterion : acute onset fluctuate course , inattention , disorganize thinking , alter level consciousness . To define delirium , first second criterion present , plus either criterion three four . The research assistant train CAM use . To ensure consistency evaluation , patient evaluate research assistant three interview . All case incident delirium validate second investigator . The investigator focus delirium measurement first 3 day postoperatively , aim avoid loss follow majority postoperative patient set get discharged third postoperative day . Associated factor Risk factor identify preoperative interview include age , history smoking alcohol use , preoperative pain score , medication , electrolyte . Other factor include type surgery , ASA classification , duration anaesthesia , Intraoperative blood loss record anaesthetic chart . Blood loss estimate use common method add volume blood absorb commonly use absorptive material include gauze piece , sponge mop . Suction canister measure pre post operatively calculate minus irrigation use case . Then total estimate intraoperative blood loss chart anaesthetic chart , intraoperative medication obtain anaesthetic chart .</detailed_description>
