	<brief_summary>Despite maximal safe surgery follow combined chemo-radiation therapy , outcome patient suffer glioblastoma ( GBM ) remain extremely poor median survival 15 month . Hence , new avenue take improve outcome devastate disease . Given intracerebral localization highly invasive feature , GBM pose specific challenge development adequate tumor model . Orthotopic xenograft model directly derive tumor patient might represent attractive perspective develop patient-specific targeted therapy . This approach remain however validate GBM offer specific challenge , include demonstration property xenograft model validly represent treatment relevant feature respective human tumor . In innovative project investigator aim compare validate approach pair human GBM respective derive orthotopic xenograft mouse brain level radiological behavior metabolism tumor , determine high resolution MRI patient ( 7T MRI ) respective orthotopic mouse xenograft ( 14.1T MRI ) , well level transcriptome , genome , methylome original GBM tissue respective derive xenografts/glioma sphere line . The data integrate multidimensional analysis interrogated similarity association molecular GBM subtype . This pilot project provide basis crucial next step , include drug intervention study . New promise drug , test pre-clinically mouse orthotopic xenograft model establish use radiologic/metabolic/molecular procedure describe project , take patient phase 0 study . GBM patient receive radiologic/metabolic follow-up use high resolution MRI drug treatment , follow resection tumor subsequent acquisition molecular data .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The present project focus evaluation multimodal approach compare human GBM pair sample orthotopic xenografts use high resolution MRI MRS multidimensional molecular profiling . 20 patient high probability newly diagnose GBM base MRI-scan ( 3 Tesla ( 3T ) MRI , T1 , T2 , T1 gadolinium , DWI &amp; MRI Spectroscopy ) identify CHUV prior undergo neurosurgical resection . Patients undergo extensive experimental radiological examination use specific MRI sequence 7 Tesla ( 7T ) MRI identify specific metabolic pathway ( see , section imaging ) . Thereafter patient undergo maximal safe neurosurgical resection tumor . The portion tumor use diagnostic purpose collect immediately use ( see , section molecular evaluation ) . Following resection , patient undergo standard care treatment [ usually combine radio-chemotherapy , offer participation clinical trial . The clinical parameter collect , include histopathological feature evolution growth pattern residual tumor ( present ) , development recurrence thereafter compare parameter evolution xenograft model . At high magnet field strength ( 7T ) , high signal-to-noise ratio increase spectral dispersion allow reliable measurement large number metabolite use Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy comparison clinical available field strength ( 3T ) . In addition , author develop full sensitivity short-echo-time single voxel spectroscopy ( SVS ) sequence `` semi-adiabatic SPECIAL '' ( 2 ) implement , validate 7T allows quantification 15 metabolite high precision include N-acetylaspartate ( NAA ) , glutamine ( Gln ) , glutamate ( Glu ) , myo-inositol ( Ins ) , phosphorylethanolamine ( PE ) , total choline ( tCho ) , creatine , phosphocreatine , N-acetylaspartylglutamate ( NAAG ) , lactate ( Lac ) , glutathione ( GSH ) , aspartate ( Asp ) , taurine ( Tau ) , scyllo-inositol Î³-aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) . This localization technique extend MR Spectroscopic Imaging ( MRSI ) technique 7T , allow map spatial distribution cerebral metabolite . Furthermore , glycine possible marker tumor malignancy detection vivo establish previous study use TE=30ms SPECIAL sequence 7T . Therefore , study aforementioned technique use obtain neurochemical information spatial distribution glioblastoma patient . These data compare neurochemical information obtain orthotopic xenograft mouse brain derive respective glioblastoma patient . All MRS measurement glioblastoma patient perform 7T MR scanner CP Transmit / 32 channel receive array head coil . Based high resolution T1-weighted image obtain use MP2RAGE sequence , Volume Interest ( VOI ) spectroscopy place accord location glioblastoma . Total acquisition time MRS within 30 min . In vivo MRS spectra post-processed metabolite concentration quantify create metabolite map . Molecular functional investigation pair sample primary glioblastoma respective orthotopic xenograft mouse The aim present study determine molecular , histopathological , functional property , include growth pattern invasiveness , original GBM respective derive orthotopic xenograft mouse , link imaging/ metabolism parameter obtain high resolution MRI . GBM sample patient collect surgery divide 2 part , ( ) snap frozen molecular analysis , ( ii ) cultivate stem cell condition subsequent stereotactic transplantation male immune-compromised mouse establishment sphere line .</detailed_description>
