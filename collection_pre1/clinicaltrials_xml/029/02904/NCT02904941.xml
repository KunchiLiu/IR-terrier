	<brief_title>Human Amniotic Versus Synthetic Membrane Transient Skin Cover Pediatric Burns</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients burn compromise 5 % total body surface area randomise receive membrane make human amnio synthetic cover acute phase care . Eligible participant child acute burn ( &lt; 24 hour ) due hot liquid compromise 5 % total body surface area . Patients burn due fire , hot surface chemical agent , delay presentation emergency department ( &gt; 24 hour ) , patient burn compromise head scalp ( exclusively case compromise exceed 50 % total body surface area affect burn ) . Patients whose parent authorise participation trial also exclude . Randomisation perform statistician unaware clinical management include patient . The specific allocation sequence keep hidden investigator . Patients , outcome assessor statistician also keep unaware treatment allocation . Blinding achieve use image analysis software assess primary endpoint . Due intervention 's characteristic , impossible perform blind attend surgeon . Analyses perform intention - - treat principle . Amniotic membrane sample collect personnel shall provide care included participant . Samples suitable donation come elective caesarean section . Once obtain , amniotic membrane store sterile container send irradiation facility provide Comisión Chilena de Energía Nuclear ( Chilean Nuclear Energy Comission ) . This sample protocol include exclusion relevant infectious disease establish Chilean Ministry Health .</detailed_description>
