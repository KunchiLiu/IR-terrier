	<detailed_description>The Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome ( HUS ) rare thrombotic microangiopathy ( TMA ) , affect child adult . HUS characterize abnormal occurrence diffuse thrombosis microcirculation result occurrence ischemic event affect especially kidney associate hemolytic anemia.Its prognosis severe , mortality 1 % child , 10 % adult occurrence renal failure 50 % cases.In typical form , HUS occur aftermath diarrheic intestinal infection bacteria produce Shiga toxin . In unusual shape , affect child adult , genetic abnormality alternate way regulate complement protein explain frequent relapses.One major problem encounter management HUS absence reliable marker treatment response relapse ; conventional hematological marker insensitive judge therapeutic efficacy identify early relapse . Data literature suggest endothelial cell major target syndrome . Our hypothesis initial micro-endothelial activation play critical role initiation / relapse disease sudden release high molecular weight ultralarge von Willebrand factor ( UL-vWHf ) procoagulant endothelial microparticles.The main objective study define `` vascular competence '' profile population patient typical atypical HUS ; acute phase remission disease .</detailed_description>
