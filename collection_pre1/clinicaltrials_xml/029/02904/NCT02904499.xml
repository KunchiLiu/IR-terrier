	<brief_summary>Public health surveillance model , previously use ongoing detection occurrence rare event , could use reinforce exist pharmacovigilance system . These model previously use Adverse Drug Reaction ( ADR ) detection medico-administrative database . DABISURV research project focus new anticoagulant therapy , dabigatran , launch recently French market atrial fibrillation ( AF ) . This drug high risk severe ADR require thus careful pharmacovigilance monitoring . Primary objective compare result ongoing surveillance model detect hemorrhage acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) associate dabigatran , result obtain analysis cohort patient AF treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use Public Health Surveillance Models French National Health System Database</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>DABISURV study consist analyze cohort patient AF receive least one prescription Vitamin K Antagonists ( VKA ) - reference group - dabigatran French National Health Insurance System . The uptake dabigatran follow detect hemorrhagic event AMI associate molecule among first user . The ability detect quickly substantial ADR new drug critical importance public health order facilitate timely public health response . If public health surveillance model find useful topic , semi-automated procedure would need detect ADR associate new generation anticoagulant medico-administrative database . If public health surveillance model find useful detection ADR , cohort study provide essential data safety profile dabigatran .</detailed_description>
