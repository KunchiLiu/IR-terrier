To investigate compare change bone mineral density ( BMD ) , trabecular bone micro-architecture , bone strength , curve severity mean 6 year longitudinal follow AIS girl low bone mass Group A B : 1 . Group A : subject follow mean 4 year completion 2-year calcium Vit-D supplementation 2 . Group B : subject without calcium Vit-D supplementation 2 . To evaluate correlation change BMD , trabecular bone micro-architecture , bone strength document Objective 1 change serum bone turnover marker</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>6 Years Study Changes Bone Quality , Bone Turnover Curve Severity AIS With Without Calcium Vit-D Supplementation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis ( AIS ) complex three-dimensional spinal deformity mostly affect girl peri-pubertal period . Prevalence range 2 4 % general population . When deformity become severe , serious morbidity occur include early back degeneration , cardiopulmonary compromise , grossly deform torso associate psychosocial issue could pose serious health threat young patient . One important health threat deserve special attention osteopenia define Bowden et al . child BMD age gender-adjusted Z-score &lt; -1 . 30-38 % AIS girls osteopenic . Osteopenia could persist across puberty find significant independent prognostic factor curve progression AIS . Osteopenia also find associate low dietary calcium ( Ca ) intake median 400mg/day among AIS girl . The low Ca intake significantly correlate age-adjusted peripheral volumetric bone mineral density ( vBMD ) measure peripheral quantitative compute tomography ( pQCT ) , well axial peripheral areal BMD ( aBMD ) measure Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry ( DXA ) . Low calcium intake couple low Vit-D status seriously affect child 's bone health . Without Vit-D , 10 15 % dietary calcium absorb , 1,25- ( OH ) 2Vit-D increase intestinal calcium absorption 30-40 % . Vit-D insufficiency disturbance Vit-D physiology associate osteopenia , derange muscle function ligamentous laxity could potentially predispose AIS subject curve progression . Given serum 25 ( OH ) Vit-D level also find low mean level 41.6 nmol/L among AIS subject , group conduct first 2-year randomize double-blinded placebo-controlled trial use calcium Vit-D supplementation young AIS girl low bone mass ( Cal study ) . There three study group trial , namely Group 1 ( placebo group ) , Group 2 ( low-dose treatment group 600mg calcium + 400IU Vit-D3/day ) Group 3 ( high-dose treatment group 600mg calcium + 800IU Vit-D3/day ) . The study show strong evidence positive bone accretion effect therapeutic control curve progression group supplementation ( Group 2 3 ) . Following therapeutic gain BMD improvement bone quality 2-year intervention calcium Vit-D supplementation , important evaluate effect persist supplement withdrawal . This study would help address key issue evaluate whether beneficial effect 2-year calcium Vit-D supplementation persist average 4 year withdrawal supplementation . The BMD , trabecular bone micro-architecture , bone strength , image-based serum bone turnover parameter , curve severity 4 year withdrawal supplement would compare measurement do end supplementation . Outcome study provide important scientific data long term effect 2-year calcium Vit-D supplementation , thus justify need lifestyle modification , duration dose supplementation well bone health curve control adolescents suffer AIS . If beneficial effect proven sustainable , 2-year calcium Vit-D supplement incorporate treatment protocol AIS Hong Kong , also Mainland China part world ; otherwise longer period supplementation sustain positive bone accretion effect prevention curve progression desirable attain peak bone mass curve control prevent osteopenia-related scoliosis-related complication approach adulthood . This six year longitudinal follow-up study 2-year active supplementation period 4-year post-withdrawal follow cohort adolescent girl unique . Not effect calcium vitamin D supplementation follow , placebo group original clinical trial provide longitudinal change anthropometric , bone density , bone quality parameter curve severity yield important reference information local adolescent AIS .</detailed_description>
