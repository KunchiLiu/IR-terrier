	<brief_title>Mental Practice Combined With Physical Practice Training Gait Improvement Parkinson 's Disease Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) progressive degenerative nervous system disease cause , among change , movement disorder lead loss motor skill , especially gait . The use mental practice ( MP ) method acquisition improvement motor skill well evidenced literature healthy individual stroke patient . However , still insufficient evidence effectiveness method PD gait improvement , limited availability MP training protocol literature purpose population . Objectives : To verify efficiency evaluate effect protocol base mental practice combine physical practice gait training guide cognitive strategy patient PD . Design : Parallel prospective , single blind , randomize clinical trial . Setting : Brazilian Parkinson Association . Participants : Seventy-five patient PD stage 2-3 disease evolution accord Hoehn Yahr Classification . Interventions : The Mental Practice training ( MPT ) consist ten gait training session , twice week , five week , use mental practice training associate physical practice guide cognitive strategy ; Physical Practice training ( PPT ) consist similar gait training MPT , guide cognitive strategy , without mental practice . The Control training ( CT ) consist similar gait training PPT , without support compensatory strategy . Primary outcome measure : Gait performance score Dynamic Gait Index ( DGI ) Six-minute Walk Test ( 6MWT ) . Secondary outcome measure : Gait performance term spatial-temporal variable ( speed , cadence , step length ) . Randomization : Participants randomize ClinStat software one three group : Mental Practice Group ( MPG ) , perform MPT ; Physical Practice Group ( PPG ) , perform PPT ; Control Group ( CG ) , perform CT. Statistical analysis : Gait performance DGI , 6MWT spatial-temporal variable 10 training session , 30 60 day subsequent end training compare MPG , PPG CG use Repeated-measures analysis variance ( RM-ANOVA ) .</detailed_description>
