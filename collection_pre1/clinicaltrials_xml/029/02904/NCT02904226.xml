	<brief_title>Dose Escalation Expansion JTX-2011 Alone Combination With Anti-PD-1 Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>JTX-2011 agonist monoclonal antibody specifically bind Inducible CO-Stimulator T cell ( ICOS ) generate anti-tumor immune response . This Phase 1/2 , open label , multicenter , dose escalation expansion , first-in-human ( FIH ) clinical study evaluate safety tolerability , PK , PD , preliminary efficacy ICOS agonist monoclonal antibody JTX-2011 alone combination fix dose nivolumab adult subject advance refractory solid tumor . The study conduct four part : single agent ( Part A ) combination therapy ( Part B ) dose escalation , expansion cohort single agent ( Part C ) combination therapy ( Part D ) .</detailed_description>
