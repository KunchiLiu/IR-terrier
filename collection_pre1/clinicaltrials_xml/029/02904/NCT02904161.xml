	<brief_summary>To address challenge isolate analyze rare cell , study aim validate technical diagnostic instrumentation , test , protocol analysis correlate number circulate tumor cell present whole blood predict cancer prognosis treatment efficacy . Investigators propose enroll follow cohort cancer patient . Blood sample collect patient regular interval determine doctor . The patient 's disease progression monitor lifetime study . The specific aim isolate , enumerate analyze number circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) patient blood use chip-based sorting , filtration image technique . Investigators also use study optimize diagnostic instrumentation , test protocol downstream CTC analysis . Investigators may also correlate result test prognosis patient well clinical evidence ( e.g . radiological imaging scan ) . While investigator focus prognosis study , correlate test potentially may also valuable future study early diagnosis monitoring cancer .</brief_summary>
