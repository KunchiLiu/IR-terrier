	<criteria>1 . Patient histologically cytologically proven clinical stage IB /II NSCLC consider eligible surgical resection curative intent . 2 . Tumor amenable pretreatment core needle biopsy without unacceptable risk major procedural complication . 3 . Measureable disease , define RECIST v1.1 . 4 . Written inform consent HIPAA obtain subject prior performing protocolrelated procedure . 5 . Age &gt; 18 year time study entry 6 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 1 . 7 . Adequate normal organ marrow function define : Haemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.5 x 109/L ( &gt; 1500 per mm3 ) Platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/L ( &gt; 100,000 per mm3 ) Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) . This apply subject confirm Gilbert 's syndrome ( persistent recurrent hyperbilirubinemia predominantly unconjugated absence hemolysis hepatic pathology ) , allow consultation physician . AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) , alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 x institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) . Serum creatinine CL &gt; 40 mL/min CockcroftGault formula ( Cockcroft Gault 1976 ) 24hour urine collection determination creatinine clearance : Males : Creatinine CL ( mL/min ) =Weight ( kg ) x ( 140 Age ) / 72 x serum creatinine ( mg/dL ) Females : Creatinine CL ( mL/min ) =Weight ( kg ) x ( 140 Age ) x 0.85 / 72 x serum creatinine ( mg/dL ) 8 . Female subject must either nonreproductive potential ( i.e. , postmenopausal history : ≥60 year old menses ≥1 year without alternative medical cause ; OR history hysterectomy , OR history bilateral tubal ligation , OR history bilateral oophorectomy ) must negative serum pregnancy test upon study entry . 9 . Subject willing able comply protocol duration study include undergoing treatment schedule visit examination include follow . 10 . No prior therapy lung cancer . 1 . Participation another clinical study investigational product last 3 week . 2 . Any previous treatment PD1 PDL1 inhibitor , include durvalumab . 3 . History another primary malignancy except : Malignancy treat curative intent know active disease ≥3 year first dose study drug low potential risk recurrence . Adequately treated nonmelanoma skin cancer lentigo maligna without evidence disease . Adequately treated carcinoma situ without evidence disease eg , cervical cancer situ , insitu urinary bladder cancer , treat localized prostate cancer ductal carcinomain situ . 4 . Mean QT interval correct heart rate ( QTc ) ≥470 m calculate 3 electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) use Frediricia 's Correction 5 . Current prior use immunosuppressive medication within 28 day first dose durvalumab , exception intranasal inhaled corticosteroid systemic corticosteroid physiological dos , exceed 10 mg/day prednisone , equivalent corticosteroid . 6 . Any unresolved toxicity ( CTCAE grade 2 ) previous anticancer therapy . Subjects irreversible toxicity reasonably expect exacerbated investigational product may include ( e.g. , hear loss , peripherally neuropathy ) . 7 . Any prior Grade ≥3 immunerelated adverse event ( irAE ) receive previous immunotherapy agent , unresolved irAE &gt; Grade 1 . 8 . Active prior document autoimmune disease within past 2 year NOTE : Subjects vitiligo , Grave 's disease , psoriasis require systemic treatment ( within past 2 year ) exclude . Patients history autoimmune hypothyroidism stable dose thyroid replacement hormone eligible . 9 . Active prior document inflammatory bowel disease ( e.g. , Crohn 's disease , ulcerative colitis ) . 10 . History primary immunodeficiency . 11 . History allogeneic organ transplant . 12 . History hypersensitivity durvalumab excipient . 13 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , uncontrolled hypertension , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , active peptic ulcer disease gastritis , active bleeding diatheses include subject know evidence acute chronic hepatitis B , hepatitis C human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement compromise ability subject give write informed consent . 14 . Known history previous clinical diagnosis tuberculosis . 15 . History leptomeningeal carcinomatosis . 16 . Receipt live attenuate vaccination within 30 day prior study entry within 30 day receive durvalumab . 17 . Female subject pregnant , breastfeed male female patient reproductive potential employ effective method birth control . 18 . Any condition , opinion investigator , would interfere evaluation study treatment interpretation patient safety study result 19 . Subjects uncontrolled seizure . 20 . History interstitial lung disease , idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis , pneumonitis ( include drug induce ) , evidence active pneumonitis screen chest CT scan . 21 . Major surgical procedure within 28 day prior Cycle 1 , Day 1 anticipation need major surgical procedure course study . 22 . Receipt last dose anticancer therapy ( chemotherapy , immunotherapy , endocrine therapy , target therapy , biologic therapy , tumor embolization , monoclonal antibody , investigational agent ) 30 day prior first dose study drug .</criteria>
