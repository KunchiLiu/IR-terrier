	<brief_summary>- Few data available treatment metastatic colorectal cancer ( mCRC ) elderly patient anti-EGFR agent combination chemotherapy . Up today , available data retrospective/post-hoc analysis , make difficult translate everyday clinical practice . - FOLFOX plus panitumumab standard first-line therapy option RAS wild-type untreated mCRC patient . Slight adjustment chemo-dosage commonly apply routinary practice elderly patient , modify schedule never prospectively test . - In elderly patient , reasonable upfront treatment fluoropyrimidine-based monotherapy plus bevacizumab , irrespectively molecular status RAS . - BRAF mutation strong negative prognostic factor associate advanced age , poor performance status ( PS ) , extend aggressive disease associate lack benefit anti-EGFR moAb . - Clinical definition elderly ( 70 year old ) CRC patient may deserve less intensive combination therapy still debate . The cut-off 75 year old combine ECOG PS assessment reasonable approach clearly define candidate different approaches31 . - Several geriatric screening tool use identify patient geriatric profile potentially predict overall survival risk toxicity . The G8 screen tool validate cancer patient show strong prognostic value overall survival ; CRASH score able stratify patient accord estimate risk treatment-related toxicity . On basis consideration , investigator design present randomize phase II trial first-line therapy panitumumab combination simplify FOLFOX 5-fluorouracil , previously untreated elderly patient RAS BRAF wild-type unresectable mCRC .</brief_summary>
