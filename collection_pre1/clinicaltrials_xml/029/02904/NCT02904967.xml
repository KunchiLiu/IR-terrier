	<brief_summary>Venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) common potentially fatal disease . It consider chronic disease recurrence rate 30 % 10 year . Reduce risk recurrence serious public health issue . For necessary identify patient high risk recurrence . However , , 50 % recurrence presence know risk factor , suggest still yet unidentified risk factor . The assumption behind project specifically associate genetic polymorphism risk VTE recurrence . The aim project identify polymorphisms genome-wide data MARTHA cohort . This cohort compose 1542 subject Marseille region least one episode VTE document . Patients cohort MARTHA genotyped approximately 500,000 polymorphism . The investigator want achieve case-control study nest cohort MARTHA . Subjects recurrent VTE ( case ) compare subject one episode VTE ( control ) . The allelic frequency polymorphisms previously genotyped 500,000 compare case control . The identification new genetic variant associate VTE recurrence allow u improve pathophysiological knowledge disease , reduce frequency episode focus research new therapeutic approach .</brief_summary>
