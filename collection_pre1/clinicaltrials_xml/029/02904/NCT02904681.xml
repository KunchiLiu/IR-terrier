	<brief_summary>Spinal growth dystrophy ( CRD ) , also call Scheuermann 's disease , correspond impaired vertebral structure occur child adolescent involvement growth cartilage cause impaired growth kyphosis . There form thoracolumbar thoracic conventional form DRC variable clinical expression ; important kyphosis spinal stiffness associate painful element . The radiographic definition accord Sorenson uniformisation 5 Â° affect least three adjacent vertebra . Scheuermann 's disease three problem . First , thoracic kyphosis generate back pain may thoracic lumbar indirectly attribute compensatory lordosis . Moreover disruption sagittal balance frequently cause significant aesthetic discomfort . Finally , scalability curvature may increase likelihood degenerative lesion disc degeneration lumbar spinal stenosis example . When disease diagnose early , treatment often associate orthopedic physiotherapy . However , patient active deformation , despite orthopedic brace treatment chronic pain , neurological deficit aesthetic reason , surgical decision take . The goal surgical treatment DRC correction thoracic kyphosis . It go spinal fusion must release column stiffness bad position , change equilibrium profile ensure remain good position . This surgery usually require prior operative time ( thoracic surgery remove intervertebral disc ) posterior surgical time ( blockage vertebra together bone graft osteosynthesis ) . Currently different surgical strategy practice real consensus team .</brief_summary>
