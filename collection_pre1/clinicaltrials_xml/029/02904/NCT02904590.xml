	<brief_title>A Prospective Study Incidence Risk Factors Related Infection Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>IBD could lead increase risk infection , particularly related immunosuppressive therapy . The true effect IBD development infection study depth since cohort study scarce result study different approach contradictory . The limited time period former study may enough assess infectious complication may occur long term period . Moreover , certain polymorphism demonstrate confer high risk opportunistic infection immunosuppressive condition , instance HIV , patient cystic fibrosis Candida ' infection . For reason , seem reasonable think genetic factor might play role risk opportunistic infection IBD . The hypothesis study patient IBD increase risk infection immunosuppressive treatment . TYPE OF STUDY Prospective cohort study evaluate effect immunosuppression clinical factor onset infection IBD STUDY DESIGN PATIENTS &amp; METHODS This study aim incidental patient diagnose Crohn 's disease ulcerative colitis include ENEIDA database . METHODS An infection would consider relevant : 1 ) require hospital admission , 2 ) lead death endangers patient 's life ( ICU admission , presence hemodynamic instability , sepsis , tracheal intubation , vasoactive drug requirement ) , 3 ) must treat specific antibiotic ( antibacterial , antiviral , antifungal ) 4 ) affect recurrently ( herpes virus , papilloma virus , etc ) . 5 ) require change/withdrawal immunosuppressive biological treatment . The appearance relevant infection prospectively evaluate , perform subanalysis 3 5 year use ENEIDA platform . ENEIDA database Spanish national study IBD genetic environmental determinant run GETECCU ( Grupo Espa√±ol de Trabajo en Enfermedad de Crohn Colitis Ulcerosa ) supervision . This database basically comprise : demographic characteristic , type IBD , immunosuppressant treatment , biological treatment surgery ) At time inclusion follow variable available ( mandatory ) : demographic characteristic , type IBD , date diagnosis , phenotypic characteristic disease , history serious infection , information receive treatment particularly exposure immunosuppressant , biological treatment surgery whether infection occur complication three treatment group . It also collect follow serologic detail : hepatitis type B virus C , HIV , tuberculosis ( TB ) , varicella zoster status . At time registration blood sample ( 10cc ) drawn send biobank analyze DNA genetic research . STUDY ANALYSIS Sample calculation The main objective study determine percentage infection IBD relate risk factor development infection patient IBD . Given report prevalence infection vary 6 10 % formula estimate endless sample , establish : - Security level confidence interval 95 % - Expected value bad case scenario 6 % ( prevalence infection ) - Precision 1.5 % - The minimum sample number set 963 , assume loss rate 20 % With assumption , total number patient included 1204 patient . The statistical analysis three step : ( 1 ) independent clinical factor analysis , ( 2 ) genetic factor infection-related analysis ( 3 ) clinical genetic factor infection- related analysis . Baseline follow data compare among patient develop infection . Quantitative variable contrast T-student Mann-Whitney test . Qualitative variable contrast X2 Fisher test . Logistic regression conduct analyze independent association variable Kaplan-Meier test calculate survival curve . An analysis Cox proportional hazard conduct assess effect exposure independent predictor risk significant infection mortality . Finally intensity significant association measure calculate OR , HR confidence interval 95 % .</detailed_description>
