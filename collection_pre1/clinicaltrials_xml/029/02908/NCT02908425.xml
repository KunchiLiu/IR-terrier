	<brief_summary>Statins class drug commonly prescribe medication develop country . Statins act enzyme HMG-CoA reductase inhibit conversion mevalonate , precursor cholesterol synthesis . Subsequently statins prescribed patient relatively high blood cholesterol level . However , take statin come without side effect . Most notably , effect statin muscle waste study extensively . This include up-regulation ubiquitin proteasome system , muscle cell damage rhabdomyolysis , elevate creatine kinase , mitochondrial dysfunction . Due negative side effect statin therapy , additional therapy warrant help offset effect muscle waste . Loss muscle mass significant concern associate reduction muscle strength power ( Ferrando et al. , 1996 ; Creditor , 1993 ) . This condition observe age , disease state , long period unload hospital admission lead disability , increase fall , loss independence , mortality . Subsequently , critical need develop intervention counteract loss muscle mass strength . Exercise one intervention , however , case may feasible option . For instance , exercise demonstrate exacerbate muscle side effect statins . Subjects complain increased muscle soreness elevate creatine kinase level also want take statin anymore ( Kearns et al. , 2008 ; Parker et al. , 2012 ; Sinzinger et al. , 2004 ) . Because limitation , critical need develop intervention prevent loss muscle mass statin use .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The use nutritional intervention gain much attention explore ability increase muscle mass and/or attenuate loss muscle mass . Leucine , isoleucine , valine branch chain amino acid study extensively show stimulate muscle anabolism . Beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate ( HMB ) , metabolite leucine , suggest play significant role preserve muscle mass situation favor muscle mass loss . This thought occur stabilize sarcolemma integrity , reduce proteasome activity expression proteasome 20S subunit , inhibition apoptosis , activation skeletal muscle satellite cell . Furthermore , catabolic-induced myotube murine adenocarcinoma cell line , HMB ( 50µM ) potent reverse increase protein degradation decrease protein synthesis compare high dose leucine ( 1mM ) . Similar finding report rodent cancer model . These data suggests HMB play significant role prevent muscle wasting . Understanding metabolic fate HMB crucial develop strategy increase HMB concentration population subject muscle wasting . The objective application determine cholesterol lower statin alters HMB metabolism healthy adult . The Researchers test hypotheses statin administration , HMB metabolism urinary excretion affect unknown effect production HMB response intake HMB precursor like leucine .</detailed_description>
