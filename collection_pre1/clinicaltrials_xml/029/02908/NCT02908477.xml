	<brief_summary>This study design patient cancer oropharynx ( tonsils base tongue ) cause HPV virus . Traditional treatment involve surgery follow six week daily radiation therapy . This study investigate less intense radiation treatment follow surgery use half dose radiation give two week rather six week . Patients randomly assign receive less intense treatment versus traditional treatment coin flip . Patients twice likely receive less intense treatment randomization .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation De-escalated Adjuvant Radiation Therapy Human Papillomavirus ( HPV ) -Associated Oropharynx Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent study suggest tumor oropharynx ( tonsils base tongue ) cause HPV virus much sensitive radiation chemotherapy . Standard treatment HPV associate oropharynx tumor surgery involve six week radiation therapy many long term side effect complication . Mayo Clinic recently pilot study investigate whether patient HPV-associated oropharynx tumor receive less radiation chemotherapy surgery compare standard treatment . The investigator current study compare new , short treatment course ( 2 week treatment ) standard course treatment ( six week ) . Patients randomize either less intense standard treatment arm . Patients twice likely receive less intense treatment randomization .</detailed_description>
