	<brief_title>Randomized Phase II Trial Chemoembolization Sorafenib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) widely perform procedure patient unresectable HCC . Although TACE induce tumor necrosis , tumor recurrence metastasis uncommon likely due stimulation angiogenesis immediately TACE . Plasma VEGF level significantly elevate follow TACE procedure , usually peak 24 48 hour treatment . Sorafenib , multikinase inhibitor , show increase survival patient advance HCC , presumably due predominant strong antiangiogenic activity thereby prevent tumor growth . However , despite target approach , sorafenib without toxicity ; consequently patient unable remain full dose throughout course treatment . Because sorafenib 's antiangiogenic property , suggest sorafenib could use combination TACE counteract post-TACE angiogenic release therefore prevent minimize risk tumor recurrence . The possible synergy TACE sorafenib test numerous clinical study . Although safety profile clearly establish , efficacy combination therapy yet demonstrate . Several combination method test , i.e. , continuously sorafenib administer first TACE continuously throughout plan TACE treatment , sequentially sorafenib administer completion TACE ( usually 4 day ) . Here , investigator postulate sequence combination could significant impact patient outcome . Specifically , investigator hypothesize continuous method superior sequential protocol presence sorafenib first TACE preempt peak angiogenesis TACE . To end , investigator propose measure VEGF level serially order detect difference two method .</detailed_description>

At least one tumor lesion accurately measure least one dimension accord RECIST ( Appendix D ) . The lesion previously treat local therapy ( surgery , radiation therapy , RFA , PEI , cryoablation ) unless show progression interim . Patients unable swallow oral medication . Prior embolization , systemic , radiation therapy HCC ( liver ) , patient take sorafenib great 2 week . Patients randomize sequential arm start take sorafenib within 2 week plan TACE procedure stop sorafenib 2 week undergoing TACE .
