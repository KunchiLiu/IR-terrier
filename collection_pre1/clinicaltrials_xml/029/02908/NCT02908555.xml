	<brief_summary>The purpose exploratory study evaluate characteristic sleep , perception barrier facilitator adequate sleep , association among sleep characteristic , executive functioning , cop , adherence , 24-hour glucose level , adjustment adolescent type 1 diabetes . A mixed method approach include quantitative component , consist actigraphy sleep diary , questionnaire , test executive function continuous glucose monitoring ( CGM ) well narrative qualitative component use . Results pilot study use provide effect size need larger-scale descriptive study establish need possible sleep-promoting intervention adolescent type 1 diabetes . This project consistent ongoing research focus develop preventive , behavioral intervention youth type 1 diabetes family improve physiological ( i.e. , glycemic control ) psychological ( i.e. , quality life ) outcomes . Sleep promotion may become important component intervention . Thus , follow specific aim address : 1 . Describe objective subjective characteristic sleep ( duration , continuity , bed time/rise time ) ; sleep quality sleep habit among adolescent type 1 diabetes . 2 . Explore relationship characteristic self-reported sleep ( i.e. , habit , duration , daytime sleepiness ) executive function , cop , adherence , adjustment ( i.e. , depressive symptom , quality life ) adolescents type 1 diabetes . 3 . Explore relationship glucose excursion sleep characteristic executive functioning . 3 . Conduct qualitative study use narrative analysis adolescent identify perceived barrier , facilitator , consequence associate insufficient sleep adolescent type 1 diabetes .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A mixed method approach use characterize sleep explore association sleep disturbance executive function , cop , glycemic control , adherence , adjustment adolescent type 1 diabetes . To understand relationship , investigator collect quantitative data , include self-report parent-report questionnaire test cognitive functioning consent screening . Clinical data relate diabetes collect medical chart CGM , overnight sleep data collect subsequent week . The investigator also collect qualitative data , use semi-structured interview . Aim 1 . Describe objective subjective characteristic sleep ( duration , continuity , bed time/rise time ) ; sleep quality sleep habit among adolescent type 1 diabetes . After complete initial recruitment procedure questionnaire , adolescent wear Respironics Minimitter Actiwatch AW64 , wrist-worn accelerometer , continuously 1 week , remove bathing , depress event marker `` light '' `` light '' time demarcate time bed . Sleep diary complete daily morning evening track daytime sleep-related behavior ( e.g. , caffeine use , exercise ) nocturnal sleep characteristic ( e.g. , bedtime , waking ) . The research assistants call adolescent day enrollment address problem elicit understand . At end week , call adolescent reminder complete data collection return watch diary prepay mailer . Data Analysis . Actigraph data score Actiware v. 5 software . Diary form prepare scannable format reduce need research staff enter data manually . Forms examine improperly fill item miss data , scan committed MS Access database . Descriptive statistic use summarize primary sleep variable ( diary actigraph ) ( % wake sleep onset , time bed , sleep efficiency , sleep latency , duration ) 1-week interval . Descriptive statistic also use characterize total component score Children 's Sleep Questionnaire . The expected outcome aim detailed characterization sleep pattern adolescent T1D identify key variable measure large scale study . Aim 2 . Explore relationship characteristic self-reported sleep ( i.e. , habit , duration , daytime sleepiness ) executive function , cop , adherence , adjustment ( i.e. , depressive symptom , quality life , anxiety ) adolescents type 1 diabetes . Questionnaires test executive function complete adolescent parent/guardian screen consent . Measures : The propose measure use ongoing study adolescent T1D , establish reliability validity . The questionnaire take 20-30 minute complete , test executive function take 5 minute . Following establish protocol , train RA demonstrate Trail Making Test use sample sheet . The adolescent time full test ( draw line connect 25 circle , alternate letter number ) . Data Analysis : To explore relationship sleep executive function , cop , adherence , adjustment , investigator use bivariate correlation . To evaluate extent insufficient sleep associate executive function , cop , adherence , adjustment population investigator use conduct independent group t-tests obtain estimate difference key variable adolescent get insufficient vs. sufficient sleep ( &lt; 7 hours/night vs. &gt; 7 hours/night ) . The investigator also calculate effect size data establish basis power analysis possible future large study . Finally , use linear regression model , effect sleep duration key variable examine control potential confounders ; gender , race/ethnicity , income show impact sleep habit . Further , investigator explore extent effect gender outcome variable interaction . The expected outcome aim estimate effect size need conduct power analyse full-scale study association sleep cognitive function , cop , adherence , adjustment . Aim 3 . Explore relationship glucose excursion sleep characteristic executive function . Using CGM data iPro CGM system , glucose excursion time hypoglycemia hyperglycemia identify . Youth already use CGM wear second monitor , provide download data CGM return visit . Data analysis : Bivariate correlation examine relationship among sleep executive function , cop , adherence , adjustment glycemic excursion conduct . To evaluate extent insufficient sleep associate executive function , cop , adherence , adjustment population independent group t-tests use obtain estimate difference key variable adolescent nighttime hypo- hyperglycemia . The effect size calculate data establish basis power analysis possible future large study . Finally , use linear regression model , effect sleep duration key variable examine control potential confounders ; gender , race/ethnicity , income show impact sleep habit . Further , extent effect gender outcome variable interaction determine . The expected outcome aim estimate effect size need conduct power analyse full-scale study association among glucose excursion , sleep characteristic , cognitive function , cop , adherence , adjustment . Aim 4 . Conduct qualitative study use narrative inquiry adolescent population identify perceive factor associate insufficient sleep adolescent type 1 diabetes . In past several decade , adolescent shift later sleep time , wake time remain , result insufficient sleep . Barriers sleep adolescent include extracurricular activity , work , academic , social interaction . More recently , electronic medium use video-game playing link shorter sleep duration . Predictors disturb sleep adolescent young adult ( college student ) include emotional academic stress . Many modifiable behavior could address future intervention . For adolescent T1D , sleep late weekend additional risk hypoglycemic episode . What known barrier facilitator sleep specific population . Interviews conduct adolescent learn story important factor associate insufficient sleep population .</detailed_description>
