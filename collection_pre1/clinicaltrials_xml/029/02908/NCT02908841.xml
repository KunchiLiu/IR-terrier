	<brief_summary>Surgicel Snow FDA approve topical hemostatic agent use surgical procedure . Like mechanical agent , Surgicel Snow form physical barrier block blood flow provide large surface area rapid formation fibrin clot . As mechanical agent derive oxidize regenerate cellulose , Surgicel Snow share mechanical hemostatic agent , benefit favorable risk profile . This study would examine efficacy Surgicel Snow vs. direct compression control capillary , venous , small arterial hemorrhage ligation conventional method control impractical ineffective patient undergo laparoscopic robotic assist laparoscopic hysterectomy . The intraoperative inclusion bleed characteristic minimal mild retroperitoneal bleed moderate retroperitoneal bleed adequately reduce standard surgical method . 60 patient recruit study , schedule hysterectomy Western Connecticut Health Network ( Norwalk Hospital Danbury Hospital ) direction Dr. Thomas Rutherford , Dr. John Garofalo , Dr. Robert Samuelson .
