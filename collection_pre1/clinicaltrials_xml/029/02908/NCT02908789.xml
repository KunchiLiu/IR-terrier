	<brief_summary>This project aim evaluate effect antimicrobial photodynamic therapy ( aPDT ) deep carious lesion . This vivo study approve Research Ethics Committee , conduct 30 patient 3 12 year . Patients include study least one primary molar permanent deep active caries limit occlusal / proximal surface involve beyond inner half dentin . The investigator consider exclusion criterion child whose parent refuse sign inform consent document ; child cooperate clinical examination/treatment ; child syndromes chronic systemic disease ; teeth painful symptom consistent irreversible pulpitis mobility ; periodontal change ; root pathological resorption ; case primary teeth root advance stage physiological resorption patient make use antibiotic study period within three month prior begin . The treatment carry local anesthesia isolation operative field rubber dam . The removal carious dentin surface demineralize necrotic subject remineralization hold drill low rpm cool sterile saline . The removal decay tissue start side wall later pulp wall . After time intervention aPDT use 0.01 % methylene blue photosensitizer hold . Finally , cavity restore adhesive composite resin system . The dentin sample collect help spoon sterile dentine two stage : C1 dig C2 aPDT . The microbiological analyzes conduct count colony form unit ( CFU / mg carious dentin ) , blindly cod sample . The viability microorganisms evaluate following culture medium : Brain Heart Infusion agar feasibility total microorganism ; CHROMagar candida Candida genus ; Mitis Salaviarius agar addition bacitracin 0.2 U/mL , sucrose glucose Streptococcus mutans ; Mitis Salivarius agar total Streptococcus ; Rogosa Agar Lactobacillus spp . enterococcosel Enterococcus genus . The reproducibility count method verify triplicate . Microbiological data evaluate appropriate statistical test level 5 % . Based project expect prove clinical efficacy aPDT use 0.01 % methylene blue adjunct reduce microorganisms interior deep carious lesion contribute clinical radiographic success .</brief_summary>
