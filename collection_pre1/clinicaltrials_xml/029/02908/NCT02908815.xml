	<brief_title>Investigating Effect Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( rTMS ) Treatment Alzheimer 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Upon meet inclusion criterion provide informed consent , participant complete series cognitive assessment rTMS treatment TMS Lab Riverview Health Center ( PE-450 ) . After enrollment patient site assign use stratified block randomization one three age-and-severity-matched equal number group : A ) Real coil treatment 2-weeks duration , B ) Real coil treatment 4-weeks duration , C ) Sham coil treatment 4-weeks duration . rTMS frequency 20 Hz use stimulate dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) patient real group . Prior first treatment , per week treatment , patient 's motor threshold measure use single pulse TMS , note intensity necessary cause small twitch thumb finger . Then , 70 mm cool coil place head location optimal stimulation DLPFC intensity 90-100 % motor threshold . The 20 Hz rTMS treatment incorporate 30 pulse per train , 25 train per side brain per session ( total 750 pulse per side per session ) . The train duration 1.5 second , intertrain interval 10 second . Each TMS treatment session take approximately 10 25 minute . The DLPFC locate patient use Brainsight neuronavigation system reference MRI scan . If MRI scan available , CT scan use . If neither available , reference head model approximate patient 's anatomy . The treatment administer daily ( 5 days/week ) either 4 week ( Groups A C ) 2 week ( Group B ) . The protocol also use sham stimulation . To prevent un-blinding , Magstim sham coil use ; provide sound tactile sensory experience real coil , attenuate strength induced electrical field brain well threshold require stimulate neuron . In addition , treatment , designate research assistant patient present . It also note people know group : rTMS administrator ( also group patient ) site site ' coordinator . The patient ' group info secure folder lock cabinet rTMS administrator three site coordinator key . Participants assess six time study . This occur week 0 , 3 , 5 , 13 , 21 , 29 4 week treatment group , week 0 , 3 , 5 , 11 , 19 , 27 2 week treatment group . Each assessment involve set nine assessment tool , include ADAS-Cog primary outcome measure various task questionnaire measure cognition , memory , caregiver burden , symptom , treatment tolerability . Patients randomized sham treatment unblinded 6 month follow offer either 2-weeks 4-weeks treatment ; patient and/or family choose duration treatment . As , 12 month assessment unblinded follow initially randomise one real group ( 2-weeks 4-weeks treatment ) .</detailed_description>
