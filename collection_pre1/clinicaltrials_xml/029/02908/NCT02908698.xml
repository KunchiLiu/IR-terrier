	<brief_summary>Atopic Dermatitis ( AD ) , also know eczema , common skin disease characterize itchy lesion . The prevalence AD increase past decade , 15-30 % child 2-10 % adult affect . The lesion atopic dermatitis patient inflamed , increased number inflammatory cell skin . The first line treatment AD steroid , reduce inflammation skin . There several way measure treatment effective , include clinical cellular . We propose control skin allergen challenge effective way measure effect steroid cellular level measurement inflammatory cell late cutaneous response . This examine use placebo-controlled trial .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel-group clinical trial evaluate steroid block late cutaneous response intradermal allergen challenge . Individuals moderate severe atopic dermatitis develop late cutaneous response intradermal allergen challenge eligible enrollment . The study divide 2 part . Part 1 : Screening Subjects meet entry criterion screen medical history physical examination . If continue meet entry criterion , atopic status document skin test common airborne allergen ( include cat , dust mite , grass , pollen ) intradermal allergen challenge perform select allergen extract . Only subject document late cutaneous response intradermal allergen challenge eligible entry Part 2 study . Part 2 : Dosing Follow-up Subjects randomly assign 1:1 receive either prednisone placebo treatment . Prednisone treatment 5 day 0.75 mg/kg , 5 day 0.5 mg/kg 5 day 0.25 mg/kg . Before dose Day 9 dose intradermal allergen challenge perform skin biopsy late cutaneous response evaluate 24 hour intradermal allergen challenge . A sample blood skin lesion obtain Day 9 treatment . Patients return follow visit Day 16 safety .</detailed_description>
