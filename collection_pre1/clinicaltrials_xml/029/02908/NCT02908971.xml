	<brief_summary>Background : Children industrialize develop country higher tendency present early sign puberty . One hypothesis include hormonal effect phytoestrogens find soy product . Objective : examine association consumption soy-based food early infancy childhood incidence early precocious puberty overweight school-aged child . Methods : study population case control study randomize prospectively follow cohort baby bear Assaf Haroffeh medical center follow milk allergy sign food intake age 3 year ( A nest cohort ) . It divide allergic milk , thus consume soy base formula food infancy childhood ( soy group ) randomize control group consume non-soy base intake . For group data available food habit infancy collect 3 day food diary current study . Physical examination , include weight , height , blood pressure Tanner Pubertal Staging perform annually .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Association Between Soy Based Formula Infancy Puberty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Soy soy-based product widely use modern day nutrition . It widely consume among population , especially among vegetarian , vegan , milk allergy , general population consume process food .Soy-based infant formula commonly use , may account nearly 25 % infant formula sell . Soy product contain phytoestrogens ( isoflavones ) suggest function weak hormonal disruptors due functional similarity mammalian estrogens active metabolite . Studies regard effect soy consumption pediatric growth body mass inconclusive . Infants feed soy-based formula high isoflavones blood concentration compare breast-fed milk-based formula feed baby . Several study discuss effect infantile physiologic telarche . Several retrospective , case-control case study report try elucidate possible clinical association consumption soy product infancy childhood pubertal menarchal timing . However , result contradictory inconclusive .Furthermore , study discussion association confound effect overweight also associate pubertal timing . Despite importance topic , paucity prospective data regard impact soy base product consumption puberty body mass index ( BMI ) . Thus , prospective study examine relationship consumption soy- base formula early infancy development early puberty change anthropometric measure school-aged child . The goal study test association early consumption soy base formula time onset secondary sexual characteristic prospective mannor consideration current dietary intake confound factor BMI familial trend . MATERIALS AND METHODS Study Population The study population base large cohort study initiate perform 2004-2006 Katz Y et al , follow prospectively newborns born time period Assaf Haroffeh Medical Center , Zerifin , Israel.The study look nutritional intake , development sensitivity milk milk allergy . The population include total 13019 child , 66 develop IgE-mediated Cow Milk Allergy ( CMA ) , 71 develop milk-sensitivity , 12638 healthy . Our study population include CMA group randomize group healthy population ( nested cohort ) . Inclusion criterion : participant initial study . Exclusion criterion : lack data regard food intake infancy group . In non-allergic child , non soy base group consume soy - base formula religious ideological reason exclude . Study design This case-control study , include specific sub-population large cohort population include prospectively collect data infantile food consumption . All original cohort participant , fulfill inclusion criterion approach participation current study . The current study include demographic clinical data collection , interview 3 day food diary preparation dietician analysis physical examination pediatric Endocrinologist . Demographic clinical data Collection Data include information initial prospective follow infancy include birth weight , birth week , parental origin , infantile food habit , maternal age allergy classification . Data collect current session : family health history include obesity , early delay puberty , , age maternal menarche age paternal shaving , parental height . The child physical activity level nutritional habit , illness , medication . Height weight measure body mass index [ BMI ] calculate report BMI-SDS . Tanner score use characterize sexual maturation . The pre-pubertal state define Tanner stage 1 genitalia testicular volume â‰¤3 ml boys absence breast development girl . A specific description axillary odor axillary hair pubertal hair perform adrenarche sign . Dietary intake analysis All participant fill detailed 3 day food diary ( two weekdays one weekend day ) accord guidance study dietician . The nutritional data food record analyze use Tzameret Program ( A computer program , base local food table , develop Israeli ministry Health ) ) .Results analysis report percent-Dietary Reference Intakes ( DRI ) .</detailed_description>
