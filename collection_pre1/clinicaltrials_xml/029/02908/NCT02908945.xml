	<brief_summary>Monitoring brain use electroencephalography ( EEG ) general anesthesia provide anesthesiologist valuable feedback deeply anesthetized patient , reduce chance under- overdose potentially improve patient outcome . However , commercial EEG monitor output process EEG ( pEEG ) develop carefully control , simple anesthetic regime - contrast multimodal `` cocktail '' drug often use clinical practice . Ketamine one potential adjunct standard anesthetic , grow body evidence suggesting may improve post-operative outcome . The effect ketamine pEEG parameter poorly understood . This randomized , open-label , feasibility study undertaken sample 30 adult outpatient surgery patient . The primary objective observe intra-operative raw pEEG trend use NeuroSENSE monitoring system patient receive one two different analgesic dos ketamine , compare patient receive ketamine , otherwise comparable general anesthetic . Secondarily , consider clinical data interest intra- post-operative context order establish broad understand potential influence two analgesic ketamine dose anesthetic depth post-operative outcome . Feasibility outcomes assess ultimate goal develop larger-scale clinical trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Ketamine WAVCNS Index During General Anesthesia : A Feasibility Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose Study The primary aim study analyze effect two different intra-operative ketamine dos , within low , analgesic range , raw process EEG ( WAVCNS ) induction , maintenance , emergence general anesthesia compare no-ketamine control group . These data compare traditional measure depth hypnosis ( DoH ) , drug requirement , blood pressure , heart rate , occurrence unwanted intra-operative event . Ultimately , result study used ass whether feasible rely WAVCNS index , valid measure anesthetic effect , either dose ketamine add anesthetic regime . This inform feasibility large trial compare effect low dose ketamine performance automate anesthesia system . Secondarily , study aim observe certain post-operative outcome previously show influenced ketamine administration , order well understand potential patient benefit associate dos ketamine . Specifically , record pain intensity , opioid requirement , PONV , dreaming , shiver occur post-anesthesia care unit ( PACU ) . Justification Study The amount anesthetic require maintain adequate DoH varies widely individual patient , within patient different condition . Processed EEG-based DoH monitor provide opportunity deliver drug dose appropriate patient accord dynamic feedback therapeutic effect . As result , quality anesthetic regimen patient outcome may improve . However , since pEEG value affect differently different type dose drug , monitor would much well utilized effect certain drug process value well define . Accumulating evidence suggest use low dose intra-operative ketamine potential clinically beneficial , especially term reduce post-operative pain , may lead reduce risk delirium chronic pain development . However , conclusive evidence effect ketamine pEEG index lack particular , effect low dose ketamine NeuroSENSE monitor 's WAVCNS index investigate . This study help establish whether WAVCNS index may use reliable measure clinical effect one two low dos ketamine use general anesthesia . This significant step towards development large randomize control clinical trial influence ketamine pEEG feedback-based anesthesia assess . Methods Study Design This randomize , open-label , feasibility study undertaken sample healthy adult outpatient surgery patient direct immediate supervision experience anesthesiologist . Intervention Patients undergo general anesthesia , consist continuous infusion propofol ( anesthesia ) remifentanil ( analgesia ) . The study-specific intervention addition EEG monitoring NeuroSENSE monitor three group , addition one two possible ketamine dos ( bolus infusion ) two group : - Group 1 : Ketamine 0.5 mg/kg load dose follow 10 mcg/kg/min infusion - Group 2 : Ketamine 0.25 mg/kg load dose follow 5 mcg/kg/min infusion - Group 3 : Control - No ketamine Randomization Thirty study participant randomly allocate one three group base randomization code assign provide informed consent . Randomization perform block size six subject maintain relatively even group size throughout study period . Blinding The goal study integrate protocol otherwise standard anesthetic . As result , anesthesiologist blind NeuroSENSE monitor display , use EEG monitoring currently part standard practice . The anesthesiologist instead rely feedback patient monitor OR , normally would . The NeuroSENSE monitor screen cover opaque card entire procedure , except display signal quality information . Blinding require avoid influence anesthesiologist 's decision base EEG parameter .</detailed_description>
