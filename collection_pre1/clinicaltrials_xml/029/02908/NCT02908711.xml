	<brief_summary>Total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) associate severe postoperative pain . Multimodal analgesia , include peripheral nerve block , recommend post-operative pain relief 1 . Perineural analgesia offer advantage extend pain relief 24 hour surgery2 . This prospective , randomize control trial design compare analgesic efficacy adductor canal block ( ACB ) perform immediately immediately primary total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) . The primary objective study measure pain score associate knee motion follow TKA among patient receive ACB part analgesic regimen TKA . Secondary end point include assessment postoperative ambulation , range motion , pain rest , opioid consumption , patient satisfaction two analgesic approach . The investigator hypothesize ACB surgery reduce patient 's postoperative pain improve patient satisfaction . All consecutive patient undergo primary TKA recruit enrollment study . Patients randomize preoperatively receive either preemptive ABC ( PreACB ) postoperative ABC ( PostACB ) . Patients randomized PreACB group receive block prior incision . Patients randomized PostACB group receive block end surgery . Both technique accordance standard care institute . All patient ACB do regional anesthesiologist regional anesthesia unit , operate room . Patient medical history obtain block place per usual protocol . Operative anesthetic detail , include medication give , record . Pain score pain medication give PACU record . Supplementary analgesic provide per institutional PACU protocol . Study data record 72 hour patient discharge . A follow-up occur 4- 6 week orthopedic follow-up appointment evaluate patient 's late pain score overall satisfaction . Data analyze conclusion study several interval prior completion study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>D. Research Design Methods Inclusion Criteria : The study prospective , randomize control clinical trial compare two method regional analgesia primary TKA . All adult primary TKA patient eligible inclusion study . Exclusion criterion : - Allergy local anesthetic systemic opioids - Contraindication regional anesthesia technique , local infection coagulopathy - Sensory/motor disorder involve operative limb - Requirements 30 mg morphine equivalent daily prior surgery - ASA 4 great - Psychiatric cognitive disorder - Incarceration - Renal insufficiency Cr &gt; 2.0 - Hepatic failure - Pregnancy - Age 18 year Potential risk procedure , explain patient , include : bleeding , local infection , local anesthetic toxicity . All commonly list rare complication procedure . After consent participation upon randomization , ACBs place either regional anesthesia bay OR prior anesthesia induction surgery , OR immediately upon completion surgery . For participate patient , follow data collect research staff : ASA physical status , age , height , weight , gender , intra- post operative quantitative opiate use ( express morphine equivalent ) , numeric VAS score , KSS score ( form include ) QoR score ( form include ) . Those collect data blind randomization patient either research group . Intraoperative care : Intraoperative anesthesia achieve use general anesthetic technique . Intraoperative analgesia administer per anesthesiologist ' discretion . All patient cement total knee utilize medial parapatellar approach , include patellar resurfacing . A tourniquet use case . Posterior capsule infiltration do 20cc 0.25 % bupivacaine , preferred method provide sacral plexus analgesia 5-6 , per current institutional protocol . ACB Procedure Details Patients lie supine position . The needle insertion site , approximately 10cm proximal operative knee , expose . The skin disinfect 2 % Chlorhexidine ultrasound probe place sterile sleeve . The femoral artery identify high frequency linear transducer ( Philips 4-12L linear transducer frequency 6-12 MHz , Milwaukee , WI ) proximal operative knee . The appropriate location injection determine follow femoral artery cephalad artery directly posterior Sartorius muscle . At level , saphenous nerve locate lateral femoral artery . An 18g insulated sonographic Tuohy needle ( Pajunk GmbH , Geisingen , Germany ) insert in-plane approach , constant ultrasound visualization , Sartorius muscle final location close proximity saphenous nerve . Once satisfied needle placement follow negative aspiration , 20 cc 0.5 % ropivacaine inject gradually needle visualization , recurrent aspiration verify absence intra-vascular injection sign . Data Collection Patients enrol study orthopedic surgical appointment upon schedule surgery . Upon enrollment , patient complete baseline KSS questionnaire ( attach ) , VAS pain score record , pre-operative analgesic medication document . To assess effect pain movement overall strength , POD 1 , patient indicate level pain use VAS numeric scale ( 1-10 ) . QoR questionnaire ( attach ) assess 24 hour placement ACB . Overall analgesic medication consumption , opioid ( express morphine equivalent ) non-opioid record PODs 1-3 . The patient also complete KSS QoR questionnaires 4-6 week orthopedic follow-up appointment , VAS score total analgesic medication document .</detailed_description>
