	<detailed_description>The decision transfuse transfuse blood product one main issue healthcare system . Timely transfusion blood patient bleeding , either due surgery trauma , prevent tissue hypoxia ischemia vital organ . However , transfusion blood product do carefully cautiously due potential complication transfusion , also cost provide blood product 1 , 2 , 3 . Hence , surgery , hemoglobin level vital role diagnosis management patient anemia . The standard laboratory method hemoglobin assessment time-consuming , give intermittent data , require venipuncture invasive painful . In past decade , use non-invasive faster method , allow physician measure hemoglobin level patient 's bedside , become widespread . One tool make possible Spectrophotometric Hemoglobin ( SpHb Masimo Rainbow Co-oximeter ) . This procedure apply digital probe allows physician monitor hemoglobin level continuously . 4 , 5 , 6 However , one main concern regard method accuracy . Actually , difference measure hemoglobin level actual hemoglobin level patient , might make impossible physician decide sufficient confidence3 . From time SpHb available operating room , various study evaluate accuracy . While accuracy report relatively acceptable ( mean difference 1-1.5 g/dl compare lab data ) ,4 still concern regard issue . Furthermore , clear whether difference would remain surgery . Because blood transfusion rarely need hemoglobin level patient high 10g/dl surgery . Also , blood transfusion become obviously necessary hemoglobin level drop 6g/dl low surgery . Therefore , accuracy tool assess hemoglobin level critical interval ( 6-10g/dl ) great importance.6,7 Experimental study confirm accuracy could change different hemoglobin levels5,8 , passage time.9 In addition , report significant blood loss even follow injection blood , average difference SpHb laboratory might change , well . 5,8 Since accuracy assessment depend extent perfusion organ probe place , method enhance blood circulation organ ( include local heating organ use digital nerve block ( DNB ) , propose increase accuracy.10 , 11 In study conduct 2012 Miller et al . 20 patient undergoing spinal surgery , DNB perform use lidocaine . The difference SpHb lab hemoglobin record first injection , almost hourly interval . These difference compare data another study without DNB . Thirty seven percent data intervention group 12 % data control group consider `` accurate '' . Results study show DNB increase perfusion index SpHb accuracy.10 Following previous study , Miller et al . carry study 2014 compare effect DNB lidocaine bupivacaine 12 healthy volunteer . DNB perform two identical finger hand volunteer . Lidocaine use one hand bupivacaine one . Results study show lidocaine bupivacaine raise perfusion index temperatures finger . The duration extent rise temperature bupivacaine , direct correlation change perfusion index SpHb.11 Since , previous study data gather healthy individual , study aim investigate effect DNB accuracy SpHb patient undergo surgery .</detailed_description>
