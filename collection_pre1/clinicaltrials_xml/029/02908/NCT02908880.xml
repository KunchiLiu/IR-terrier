	<brief_summary>Research study test safety effectiveness new vascular closure device close femoral access puncture create patient require form access order perform plan procedure . The MANTA device expect seal femoral access puncture le 1 minute . This may result less blood loss short time walk compare alternative closure mean . Use MANTA device study experimental . All part procedure involve standard medical care .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MANTA Vascular Closure Device Clinical Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The MANTA device VCD intend use catheterization laboratory follow percutaneous cardiac peripheral procedure use retrograde common femoral artery access route large bore ( 10‐18F ID ) interventional device . The function MANTA percutaneously close puncture artery wall ( arteriotomy ) catheter inserted procedure . The study conduct demonstrate safety effectiveness MANTA achieve hemostasis femoral arterial access site subject undergo percutaneous transcatheter interventional procedure use large-bore procedure sheath .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1 . Candidate elective plan ( i.e. , emergent urgent ) percutaneous transcatheter interventional procedure via 1018F size retrograde common femoral artery approach ( i.e. , transcatheter aortic valve implantation [ TAVI ] , endovascular aneurysm repair [ EVAR ] , Impella® use ) 2 . Vessel size would allow access MANTA device determine baseline CTA : minimum vessel diameter 5mm 14F MANTA 6mm 18F MANTA 3 . Eligible sheath removal catheterization lab 4 . Age ≥21 year 5 . Understand sign study specific write informed consent form 6 . Able willing fulfill followup requirement 7 . In investigator 's opinion , patient suitable MANTA vascular closure device , conventional hemostasis technique participation investigational trial 1 . Known pregnant lactate 2 . Immunocompromised preexist autoimmune disease 3 . Systemic infection local infection near access site 4 . Significant anemia ( hemoglobin &lt; 10 g/DL , hematocrit &lt; 30 % ) 5 . Morbidly obese cachectic ( BMI &gt; 40 kg/m2 &lt; 20 kg/m2 ) 6 . Known bleed disorder include thrombocytopenia ( platelet count &lt; 100,000 cells/UL ) , thrombasthenia , hemophilia , von Willebrand disease 7 . Allergy bovine material device material , include collagen and/or collagen product , polyglycolic polylactic acid , stainless steel nickel 8 . Femoral artery puncture target groin within prior 14 day 9 . Previous iliofemoral intervention region access site , include limited prior atherectomy , stenting , surgical grafting procedure access area 10 . Patients undergone use intraaortic balloon pump arterial access site within 30 day prior baseline evaluation 11 . Patients mobile confine wheelchair bed 12 . NYHA class IV heart failure 13 . Patients already participate IDE study 14 . Currently participate another clinical trial unapproved investigational device drug conclude followup period 15 . Patient adhere complete investigational protocol reason include limited geographical residence , psychiatric condition life threaten disease</criteria>
