	<brief_summary>Aim . To investigate effect intradialytic aerobic resistance cycling exercise program ( IARCEP ) depression , fatigue , quality life ( QOL ) end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) patient receive haemodialysis , determine effect mediation self-efficacy resilience patient receive IARCEP . Background . Depression fatigue common ESRD patient undergo haemodialysis , negatively affect QOL . Exercise mitigate effect . Patient 's self-efficacy resilience may crucial mediator exercise . Design . This study randomise control trial . Method . Seventy-six participant randomly assign either control exercise group . Both group receive routine care ; whereas exercise group participate 3- month IARCEP . Data collect baseline , first , second , third month , 14 month 2013-2014 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>According United States Renal Data System ( 2015 ) , 2013 , 88.2 % incident case ESRD involve renal replacement therapy haemodialysis , ESRD highly prevalent Taiwan , 2,902 case per million people ; 89.7 % case 2012 involved maintenance haemodialysis treatment renal replacement therapy . Patients generally receive haemodialysis 3 day per week , session generally take 4 hr . Beginning dialysis induces multiple physical psychological stressor patient . In particular , importance intervention program improve psychosocial function note consider disease long-term treatment . High depression fatigue crucial consideration global care dialysis patient factor associated mortality . A significant correlation exists reduce physical activity increase depression fatigue ; decrease activity , muscle strength decrease , exacerbate depression fatigue . Depression common psychosocial problem observe ESRD patient undergo haemodialysis , prevalence 27.9 % 40.2 % associate high risk hospitalisation prolong hospital stay , reduce quality life ( QOL ) , decrease adherence dialysis prescription , increase medical comorbidity . Fatigue another critical concern cause haemodialysis ; ESRD patient receive haemodialysis reduce red blood cell production , thus cause fatigue , prevalence range 53 % 97 % . Fatigue negative effect physical function , ability perform daily activity , QOL , even survival patient . QOL subjective perception illness correspond treatment regard physical , psychological , social well-being ; however , QOL serve prognostic measure predictor survival . ESRD patient receive haemodialysis low QOL patient chronic illness general population . Lower health-related QOL associate high rate hospitalisation low rate survival among patient undergo haemodialysis . Therefore , identify effective intervention assist ESRD patient receive haemodialysis manage physical , psychological , social problem critical . Regular exercise could improve general health many chronically ill patient . Planned exercise program nonpharmacological intervention safely effectively improve depression , fatigue , QOL . For ESRD patient undergo haemodialysis , many previous study show exercise decrease fatigue depression , improve QOL . Accordingly , intradialytic exercise program consider possible therapeutic approach improve fatigue , depression , QOL ESRD population encourage perform haemodialysis centre . Although benefit relate exercise program know , effective intradialytic exercise program routine therapy yet develop . Few previous study implement exercise program examine effect psychological factor QOL patient receive haemodialysis Taiwan . Exercise self-efficacy crucial mediator health behaviour . Self-efficacy key construct social-cognitive theory , personal belief correspond individual 's perceive ability successfully perform specific task activity . Pertaining beliefs person 's ability manage prospective situation , self-efficacy belief focus mediate change individual behaviour . Thus , self-efficacy mediating effect depression result stressful event . Self-efficacy mediator complement family healthcare provider support diminish negative impact depression haemodialysis patient . Relevantly , resilient people tend apparent adaptive behaviour , particularly relate somatic health . Resilience specifically refer smooth rapid recovery setback may occur person 's life . As , psychological resilience consider protective mechanism operate presence negative stressor . People maladaptive low competence low adversity score low measure resilient competent group . Exercise self-efficacy , resilience , exercise behaviour interrelate . Self-efficacy may motivate people perform physical activity . However , true effect exercise program fail account mediate effect exercise self-efficacy resilience . Purpose Statements The purpose study investigate effect intradialytic aerobic resistance cycling exercise program ( IARCEP ) depression , fatigue , QOL ESRD patient receive haemodialysis , determine effect mediation exercise self-efficacy resilience patient receive IARCEP . METHODS Research Design Participants This study adopt randomise controlled trial design . ESRD participant recruit haemodialysis centre 872-bed regional hospital Northern Taiwan . Data collect 14 month 2013-2014 . The exercise group receive routine nursing care addition IARCEP 3 month . The control group receive routine care study period . A randomisation procedure perform outside study site two nurse researcher . Permuted-block randomisation , every block comprise four patient , adopt balance number patient exercise control group . A randomisation list drawn use random computer-generated sequence . Information regard sequence separately place opaque , seal envelope ensure participant randomly allocate exercise control group . Outcomes repeatedly measure four time baseline first , second , third month . Intradialytic aerobic resistance cycling exercise program ( IARCEP ) An exercise program brochure IARCEP make available exercise group participant ensure stationary cycling would perform appropriately . A horizontal electromagnetic cycle ergometer ( Medical Exercise Peddler 3000 , Medi-Bike , Taiwan ) use participant ' cycling performance . The exercise perform first 2 hr haemodialysis session ( 30 min per session , 3 session per week 3 month ) . All participant assess cardiac medical contraindication exercise use PAR-Q . Participants require perform stationary cycling intensity 11-13 20 , correspond rate perceive exertion Borg scale , whereby intensity 65 % -85 % participant 's maximal capacity , represent level cardiovascular health maintain . Exercise pause participant systolic blood pressure 180 mmHg , diastolic blood pressure 95 mmHg , heartbeat 60 beats/min , pulse oxyhaemoglobin saturation ( SpO2 ) 88 % . The participant ' cardiac rhythm continuously monitor . Blood pressure SpO2 also measure every 5 min . The criterion interrupt exercise include physical exhaustion , chest pain , dyspnoea , dizziness , significant instability heartbeat blood pressure . Immediately follow exercise , participant assist remove stationary cycling gear adopt comfortable position immediate assessment blood pressure , heart rate , SpO2 . Participants include subsequent analysis perform aforementioned exercise procedure least 10 time per month .</detailed_description>
