	<detailed_description>All woman use 4 product randomize study design crossover evaluation 10 visit two month . Visits schedule participant menstruating/bleeding . The sequence film use randomize . Study procedures involve screen visit ( VISIT 1 ) baseline cervicovaginal lavage collect infection exclude . After randomization ( VISIT 2 ) woman give instruction instruct insert first film . An external genital examination perform participant insert film verify film placement . In event participant difficulty place film , study clinician may place film . Following film insertion , questionnaire administer obtain feedback regard ease administration . Thirty minute product insertion clinician visualize film placement vagina speculum examination . Women counsel avoid sexual activity vaginal product usage VISIT 3 schedule following day . At visit 3 woman speculum examination ass whether film complete disintegrate CVL sample collect . Women give appointment next film insertion 7-20 day . The general sequence event repeat subsequent film . At next visit ( VISIT 4 ) woman insert second film evaluation visit 2 . A CVL sample collect 24 hour later ( VISIT 5 ) . Women ask return insert another film 7-20 day later ( VISIT 6 ) CVL sample collect next day ( VISIT 7 ) . Women receive final film 7-20 day later ( VISIT 8 ) final CVL collection follow film insertion next day ( VISIT 9 ) . A final visit ( VISIT 10 ) schedule &gt; 14 day visit 9 . During visit CVL collect glycomic innate antiviral activity study depth interview conduct order gain insight role film polymer size perceive ease insertion across four film type .</detailed_description>
