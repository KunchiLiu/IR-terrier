	<brief_summary>Patients ductal carcinoma situ ( DCIS ) treat available therapy experience excellent outcomes low mortality rate due disease 's non-invasive nature . However , considerable debate exists DCIS lesion treat . As result , determine strategy manage DCIS identify research priority . The role sentinel lymph node biopsy ( SLNB ) DCIS management controversial general need scrutiny . Our study address evidence gap investigator propose retrospective cohort study investigate outcome SLNB among DCIS patient . Specifically , investigator compare outcome , include survival outcome treatment side effect , among woman old 67 year age DCIS receive SLNB vs. receive SLNB within 6 month DCIS diagnosis . The investigator two primary aim study : Aim 1 : investigator select study sample use SEER-Medicare database . The investigator determine association SLNB acute/subacute side effect , include lymphedema , pain , limitation movement upper extremity first breast conserve surgery 9 month post-diagnosis . Aim 2 : investigator determine association SLNB long-term outcome , include breast cancer specific mortality , ipsilateral invasive breast cancer diagnosis , subsequent mastectomy treat recurrence , lasting side effect , &gt; 9 month post-diagnosis death end study period .

	<brief_title>Comparative Effectiveness Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Ductal Carcinoma In Situ</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Because non-invasive nature ductal carcinoma situ ( DCIS ) , patient treat available therapy excellent outcomes low rate breast cancer mortality . Considerable debate exists DCIS lesion treat , although movement toward less intensive intervention identification patient subset favorable prognosis . Some prospective study find rate ipsilateral invasive cancer occurrence still high receive breast conserving surgery ( BCS ) alone , even among patient favorable pathologic characteristic . Such finding argue active surveillance DCIS treatment . However , evidence exists older DCIS patient low rate ipsilateral recurrence DCIS among old patient tend indolent . Identifying suitable subgroup among low risk group may safe receive less aggressive treatment could change current practice pattern aggressive treatment . Even DCIS patient opt receive less intensive treatment BCS without radiation therapy , provider need decide whether undergo sentinel lymph node biopsy ( SLNB ) . A systematic review show evidence gap exist regard benefit SLNB DCIS . Given likelihood axillary recurrence low among DCIS patient receive radiation therapy , routine SLNB recommend DCIS patient . Of note , radiation therapy control axillary disease present . If investigator plan empower DCIS patient choose less intensive management option , BCS forgo radiation therapy ( RT ) , crucial patient provider understand role SLNB . The overarch goal study compare side effect outcomes receive SLNB vs. receive SLNB among old DCIS patient receive BCS . With data , investigator also aim identify sub-populations less intensive treatment may appropriate . Using Surveillance , Epidemiology , End Result ( SEER ) -Medicare link data , project 's overarch aim : Among old woman DCIS receive BCS first surgery , compare outcomes receive sentinel lymph node biopsy ( SLNB ) vs. receive SLNB within 6 month DCIS diagnosis : Aim 1 : The investigator determine association SLNB acute/subacute side effect , include lymphedema , pain , limitation movement upper extremity first BCS 9 month post-diagnosis Aim 2 : The investigator determine association SLNB long-term outcome , include breast cancer specific mortality , ipsilateral invasive breast cancer diagnosis , subsequent mastectomy treat recurrence , lasting side effect , &gt; 9 month ' post-diagnosis death end study period . Our study retrospective cohort study study population DCIS patient older 67 year ( hereafter refer old woman ) enrol fee-for-service Medicare program reside SEER area 1998 2011 ( 1998 2013 Aim 2 ) follow 2012 ( 2015 Aim 2 ) . The investigator select age 67 year cut-off value investigator plan use two year claim data identify patient comorbidities control statistical model , data first available age 65 . Given nature observational study design , investigator apply standard multivariate analysis propensity score methodology reduce influence confounders . The investigator control patient demographic , comorbidities , functional status , tumor characteristic , prior healthcare utilization . Using distance near provider use SLNB DCIS surgeon 's tendency use SLNB stage I/II breast cancer , investigator also plan conduct instrument variable analysis necessary . Stratifying patient key DCIS characteristic ( include grade , comedonecrosis , tumor size ) predict life expectancy ( give age comorbidities ) , investigator also hope identify patient subgroup may safely forgo SLNB . In comparison baseline characteristic intervention control group , investigator conduct standard descriptive statistic use chi-square test categorical variable t-tests continuous variable . The investigator tabulate frequency outcomes interest intervention vs. control group . For multivariable analysis , investigator apply proportional hazard model test whether intervention associate well outcomes . investigator plan control issue use propensity score matching methodology . Prior literature suggest inclusion either measure variable variable associate treatment selection ( SLNB status ) conduct analysis use propensity score method . Specifically , approach match base Mahalanobis distance calculate use age , race , residence metropolitan county , comorbidity , prior influenza vaccination prior visit primary care physician ( proxy access care ) , income , preoperative MRI use , tumor characteristic . Tumor characteristic include size , grade , comedonecrosis , estrogen receptor status . By incorporate factor match , investigator expect substantially decrease bias balance risk outcomes interest SLNB non-SLNB group . The difference outcome control intervention group estimate Kaplan-Meier curve . The investigator estimate relative risk propensity score match sample use standard method matched-pair data . The investigator use Cox proportional hazard model investigate association various factor ( grade , tumor size , estrogen receptor status ) outcomes .</detailed_description>
