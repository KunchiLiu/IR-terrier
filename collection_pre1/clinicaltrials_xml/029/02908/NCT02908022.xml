	<detailed_description>At training session , clinician patient fill set questionnaire go standardized psychophysical test assess visual display affect . They also inform efficacy electroacupuncture relieve pain experiment . During clinical examination , clinician follow clinical exam protocol intake FM patient ; include physical exam pain assessment . While scanner , clinician receive pain stimulation pressure cuff leg 8 minute paradigm order get cerebral representation . The patient , place different scanner run simultaneously , experience pain stimulation pressure cuff interact via live camera clinician scanner . When visually prompt via cue screen , clinician activate analgesia patient , response device ( response box ) clinician 's one hand . After trial pain with/without treatment , clinicians ask `` feel outcome ( extremely positive - extremely negative ) '' , satisfy ( Not satisfy - Very satisfied ) Numerical Rating Scales ( NRS ) . The patient also give rating trial pain with/without treatment . They ask ask `` feel outcome ( extremely positive - extremely negative ) ? `` , `` painful cuff ( Not painful - Extremely painful ) ? '' NRS . After scan , clinician patient ask rate anxiety presence visual stimulus precede cuff activation ( anxious - extremely anxious ) . After final MRI session , clinician patient give chance report responses treatment debriefed .</detailed_description>
