	<detailed_description>The U.S. Army invest significant time money training leader . Individuals choose Army Infantry career expend significant time , energy , commitment self-development achieve career goal . While Infantry Basic Officer Leaders Course ( IBOLC ) graduate demonstrated ability perform skill require Ranger School success , personal stress Ranger School appear continual barrier successful Ranger School graduation , 45.25 % IBOLC graduate pass Ranger training 2013 . Omega-3 highly unsaturated fatty acid ( HUFAs ) , specifically EPA ( eicosapentaenoic acid ) DHA ( docosahexaenoic acid ) , concentrated neural tissue , essential neural function ( McNamara &amp; Carlson , 2006 ) , must obtain dietary source . United States ( U.S. ) food production practice last century result dramatic change fatty acid profile U.S. diet . At time , evidence continue build regard potential importance omega-3 HUFAs emotional state , cognitive function , mental health . The purpose study investigate whether supplementation omega-3 HUFAs krill oil concentrate improve emotional status related cognitive performance stress among Infantry Officer Trainees IBOLC , ( Part I ) subsequent Ranger School ( Part II ) . More broadly , Americans continue report live high level stress , 20 % reporting state severe stress . The potential impact study would information would support role dietary supplementation omega-3 HUFAs krill oil concentrate contribute improve mood , emotional status , cognitive performance among U.S. population . Overview : The Ranger Resilience Improved Performance Phospholipid Bound Omega-3 's ( RRIPP-3 Study ) double-blinded , randomize , placebo-controlled trial conduct Medical University South Carolina ( MUSC ) partnership National Institutes Health ( NIH ) work permission leadership IBOLC U.S. Army Ranger Training School Fort Benning , GA . Participants ( 450 individual ) randomize one two experimental group 2 Parts : Part I : IBOLC Part II Ranger School . Intervention Schedule : Participants provide capsule krill oil concentrate ( 2.3g/day HUFAs EPA DHA ratio approximately 2:1 ) placebo ( macadamia nut oil appropriate matching colorant krill oil ) deliver 8 capsule per day Part I ( IBOLC training ) . Compliance Monitoring : Finger prick blood sample collect assessment fatty acid baseline specific time point IBOLC pre- post-Ranger training analyze collaborate laboratory National Institutes Health . Study Participants : Sample Size : The sample size calculation base difference one specific cognitive test placebo treatment group base prior omega-3 supplementation study . The total sample size need detect group difference 352 ( 176 per group ) . Accounting potential attrition rate 25 % , total number enrol subjects=450 . Calculations make use PASS 2008 software , ( Version 08.0.13 , Kaysvile , Utah ) . Location , Population , Recruitment Strategy : This study conduct Fort Benning , GA laboratory analytic support NIH MUSC . All healthy individual arrive Fort Benning participate IBOLC intention continue directly Ranger Training completion IBOLC eligible study . Information RRIPP-3 Study available IBOLC student upon arrival Fort Benning prior IBOLC . Those interested potentially participate study review information study begin IBOLC sign screening/enrollment session . After see video study inform consent process , answer eligibility question , student remain interested , ask sign inform consent Health Insurance Portability Accountability Act ( HIPAA ) baseline assessment . Once consent obtain , volunteer participate study baseline enrollment , randomize , provide omega-3 HUFA placebo capsule . Study Sessions : Overview : All participant expect participate 5 session hold Fort Benning . During enrollment session 24-hour dietary recall 30-day food frequency questionnaire administer . Subsequent session schedule 8 week check-in two mid-points IBOLC , leave Ranger School ( whether training complete ) . Trained study coordinator collect data RRIPP-3 study . With exception dietary assessment interview , assessments RRIPP-3 study participant self-responses . Whether self-response coordinator interview , response collect directly automate , assessment order-sequenced computer test battery . With exception inform consent document , participant information directly enter MUSC secure server part RRIPP-3 study file . Participants assign study ID number enrollment use study duration . All data collect file conjunction participant study ID number . USDA Automated Multiple-Pass Method ( AMPM ) 24-Hour Dietary Assessment : AMPM ( USDA , http : //www.ars.usda.gov/Services/ ) computerize method collect interviewer-administered 24-hour dietary recall person . Food Frequency Questionnaire : The Diet History Questionnaire ( DHQ ) freely available food frequency questionnaire ( FFQ ) . The DHQ II consist 134 food item 8 dietary supplement question . RRIPP-3 use DHQ II electronic version include usual intake previous 30 day portion size ( NCI , 2010 ) . Data Coding Analysis : Data collect manage use REDCap electronic data capture tool host MUSC ( redcap.musc.edu ) ( Harris et al. , 2009 ) . All cod RRIPP-3 study data collect separately transfer MUSC secure server . This cod data label participant study id participant randomization number . Adverse event report use eIRB , South Carolina 's federated online IRB system . Randomization Scheme : The 2 treatment group balance respect commission source post-graduation destination use stratified blocked design . Statistical Analysis Intent treat verify compliance assessment : All hypothesis test use `` intent treat '' `` as-per-protocol '' criterion . Data Analysis : Improvement critical facet cognitive function IBOLC ( Part I ) Ranger School ( Part II ) : Descriptive statistic ( e.g . mean , standard deviation , median , percentage ) use characterize 2 treatment group . T-tests , chi-square test , non-parametric test ( Wilcoxon rank sum , Fisher 's exact ) use compare baseline characteristic group . As IBOLC class unit may represent intraclass correlation , variable create represent class representation combine model . In addition , time intervention time Part II end-point may vary subject thus may adjust analysis appropriate . The primary analysis involve generalize linear mixed model ( GLMMs ) ( random subject effect ) perform determine whether group assignment active placebo treatment improve score cognitive function psychological assessment . The primary outcome measure cognitive function cognitive psychological measure outline . Other intermediary variable include model indicate . Hypothesis test 2-tailed , p-values compare overall alpha level 0.05 . Secondary analysis conduct examine treatment efficacy subject subgroup , although statistical power may lower analysis give reduced sample size . GLMMs non-linear mixed model random subject intraclass cluster effect use appropriate .</detailed_description>
