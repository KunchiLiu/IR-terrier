	<brief_summary>The primary objective study assess safety efficacy Tranexamic acid ( TXA ) reduce blood loss transfusion requirement patient osteoporotic hip fracture . In addition assess blood loss patient , complication associate TXA use would characterize include systemic ( pulmonary embolism , deep venous thrombosis , myocardial infarction , stroke ) surgical site ( hematoma , infection ) event , need re-hospitalization re-operation 30 day mortality .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Oral TXA Reducing Blood Loss Transfusion Hip Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hip fracture associate significant blood loss subsequent need blood transfusion . The cause bleed multifactorial , increased fibrinolytic activity one . The use allogenic blood product expensive associate increase risk hemolytic anaphylactic reaction , post-operative infection lengthen hospital stay . Tranexamic acid ( TXA ) simple inexpensive pharmacological agent inhibits fibrinolysis reduce bleeding . It 44 year history clinical use begin patient symptomatic menorrhagia well bleed prophylaxis hemophiliac patient undergo tooth extraction Tranexamic acid ( TXA ) antifibrinolytic medication ( reduces destruction blood clot , thus promote ability stop bleeding ) frequently use reduce perioperative blood loss , blood transfusion associate cost major cardiac , vascular , obstetric , orthopedic procedure . It use successfully orthopedics reduce perioperative blood loss , particularly spine surgery , total knee total hip arthroplasty ( THA ) . Multiple recent meta-analyses find use TXA set total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) THA lead significantly less overall blood loss lower rate blood transfusion without increase rate venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) complication . Osteoporotic hip fracture increase risk elective orthopaedic surgery patient expose double bleeding insult . Fractures bleed many patient sustain first hit hematoma form soft tissue lead symptomatic anemia . Subsequently patient sustain additional blood loss undergo surgery definitive treatment injury . Trauma surgeon understand risk hemorrhage associate trauma routinely give TXA patient present high energy injury . The CRASH-2 trial international study randomize 20,000 bleed trauma patient get TXA match placebo upon presentation . With 99.5 % follow , author note decreased risk bleed death without ill effect . However , limited data use patient hip fracture . We propose double-blinded , randomize , control trial compare perioperative administration TXA placebo set femur fracture . Thus goal examine safety efficacy TXA reduce blood loss red blood cell requirement patient intertrochanteric , subtrochanteric femur fracture time hospital admission .</detailed_description>
