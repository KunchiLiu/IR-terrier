	<brief_title>Effect Folic Acid Skin Fungal Pattern Patients With Arsenicosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Arsenicosis remain precarious issue Bangladesh last decade . The fact resentment perilous condition still remain unresolved worldwide . So , become demand era address issue . Different disease manifest different way . In arsenicosis melanosis keratosis common manifestation . The actual mechanism development keratosis unclear . Chronic ingestion arsenic contaminate water cause accumulation arsenic keratin rich tissue like skin , hair , nail produce characteristic skin manifestation like melanosis keratosis . Metabolism arsenic depends folate pathway dietary deficiency folic acid reduce total arsenic excretion lead development cancer . In different study result show folic acid reduces blood arsenic level . As arsenicosis chronic disease condition , fungal infection common . Moreover skin fungal pattern arsenicosis yet know . Therefore , study conduct determine change skin fungal pattern patient palmar arsenical keratosis administration folic acid . Forty two patient palmar arsenical keratosis recruit basis inclusion exclusion criterion . Twenty one patient furnished folic acid ( 5 mg ) iron ( 200 mg ) daily 12 week without interruption . Another twenty one patient furnish iron ( 200 mg ) daily 12 week without interruption . Water nail sample collect confirm diagnosis . Skin sample collect two time ( give iron folic acid ) qualitative analysis fungi . So , study determine change fungal pattern administrate tablet folic acid .</detailed_description>
