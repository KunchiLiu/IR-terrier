	<detailed_description>Methamphetamine addiction ( MA ) global health problem high prevalence great social health cost United States Republic South Africa , strong need development implementation effective MA treatment approach . This study correlate MA-abstinence outcome 8-week contingency management ( CM ) program voucher- base incentive use escalate schedule successfully implement adjunct MA treatment investigator collaborator United States . Pre- post- treatment neuroimaging neurocognitive assessment assist identify structure and/or process may represent target development novel behavioral and/or medication therapy . The study two specific aim : ( 1 ) determine whether change neural function within frontostriatal circuitry baseline end 8- week CM program associate parallel change measure cognitive control impulsivity MA abstinence outcome ; ( 2 ) determine whether structural change frontostriatal circuitry 8-week CM intervention correspond neurocognitive , psychological MA abstinence measure . Findings study describe association : ( 1 ) functional structural index brain area support work memory , cognitive control/inhibition ; ( 2 ) performance select neurocognitive psychological assessment ; ( 3 ) association MA abstinence outcome . Study activity neuroscience data generate provide preliminary data large , adequately power study test way optimize behavioral therapy treat stimulant use disorder . Furthermore , public health relevance study enhance effort develop capacity productive impactful neuroscience research agenda group strong clinical scientist U.S. Republic South Africa .</detailed_description>
