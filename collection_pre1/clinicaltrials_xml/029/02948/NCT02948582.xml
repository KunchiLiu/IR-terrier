	<brief_summary>The study assess safety ability orally inhaled medicine [ i.e. , Glycopyrrolate Inhalation Solution = GIS ] improve airflow lung deliver use eFlow nebulizer 42 patient Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) . Each patient randomly receive several , single dos GIS , placebo , separate approximately 1 2 week . After dose give , lung airflow measure 24 hour blood collect measure much GIS bloodstream . The study conduct find once-a- day GIS dose produce high improvement lung airflow use eFlow nebulizer .</brief_summary>
