	<brief_summary>Maintenance healthy pregnancy depend appropriate adaptation responsiveness blood vessel , ensure appropriate blood flow fetus everyday stressor . Previous work investigator demonstrate pregnancy , part nervous system responsible cardiovascular function ( sympathetic nervous system ) hyperactive . The investigator also know woman develop high blood pressure pregnancy sympathetic nervous system activity even high . Yet , little known occurs might affect . Pregnant woman encourage active , yet , less 15 % woman perform sufficient exercise meet current guideline . This important hyperactivity sympathetic nervous system observe inactive population link adverse cardiovascular health outcome include hypertension , atherosclerosis , heart attack , stroke . Indeed , 2011 , American Heart Association state inactivity risk factor potent cigarette smoking development future cardiovascular disease woman . The investigator ' work others demonstrate exercise pregnancy beneficial mom baby ; however , effect prenatal exercise neurovascular function know . If exercise effective control increase sympathetic activity occur pregnancy , effect cardiovascular system , may help prevent development high blood pressure cardiovascular problem pregnancy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objective study : 1 ) examine impact exercise sympathetic vascular function pregnancy ; 2 ) examine role endothelial function vascular effect exercise pregnancy . Study design : 100 woman ( &gt; 18yrs ) recruit first second trimester ( &lt; 20 wks ) . Women multiple pregnancy exclude . Eligible woman randomize aerobic exercise intervention ( EXER ) intervention ( CTRL ) . Initial test take place 16-20 week pregnancy . Following initial baseline testing , woman randomly assign exercise intervention intervention . Women receive opaque sequentially number envelop allocation . Allocation determine use randomly generate allocation sequence individual associate research study . The intervention consist aerobic exercise equivalent 50-70 % heart rate reserve , 3-4 time per week end study ( 34-36 week ) . For initial baseline testing ( 16-20 week ) end intervention ( 34-36 week ) , participant visit laboratory twice On Day 1 , participant complete peak exercise test treadmill bike volitional fatigue measure fitness cardiovascular/cerebrovascular response exercise . On Day 2 Participants arrive fast ( 12 hr ) blood sample collect . Anthropometrics , personal/familial history hypertension pregnancy complication record . Following standardized breakfast , participant undergo assessment reflex neurovascular control include cold pressor test , flow mediate dilation end expiratory voluntary breath hold . Muscle sympathetic nerve activity , ultrasound ( blood flow diameter brachial , femoral carotid artery ) , blood pressure , heart rate respiratory variable measure . OUTCOME/IMPACT Pregnancy stress-test life ; woman develop complication pregnancy high risk cardiovascular disease later life . Exercise well know prevent cardiovascular disease improvement endothelial function sympathetic nervous system . Whether improvement also see pregnancy remain see .</detailed_description>
