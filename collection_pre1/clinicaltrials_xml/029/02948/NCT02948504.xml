	<brief_summary>Intracranial aneurysm common general population . The overall prevalence unruptured intracranial aneurysm ( UIAs ) estimate 2.3-3.2 % population without specific risk factor SAH . As noninvasive imaging modality commonly use , UIAs increasingly detect . Most patient small aneurysm ( less 5mm ) incidentally find clinical practice . Some study indicate majority patient UIAs , particularly small aneurysm ( &lt; 7mm ) , low risk rupture , others find small ruptured aneurysm high proportion patient SAH . Therefore , lot controversy regard small aneurysm leave untreated , aneurysms need treat clip coiling . The prevalence varies widely among different detection method , race/ethnicity patient inherited disease . Although wealth data available natural history UIAs , true natural history remain unknown case selection bias occur almost study . However , data Chinese UIA unknown . Using MR angiography ( MRA ) detect aneurysm , prevalence 7 % select adult population China . Therefore , small UIAs common increasingly detected clinical practice . Conservative treatment , surgical clipping endovascular coil three treatment option UIAs . The optimal treatment remain controversial , particularly small aneurysm ( less 7mm ) . To date , clinical trial compare safety efficacy conservative treatment surgical clipping endovascular coiling UIAs . It may impossible conduct randomize control study consider aneurysm rupture devastating event . However , surgical clip endovascular treatment carry risk immediate morbidity mortality . Therefore , substantial variability widely exist treatment decision-making UIAs , may lead great variability clinical recommendation . Our study prospective observational study identify incidence rupture small aneurysm first year diagnosis aneurysm leave untreated . Meanwhile , determine difference outcomes , procedural complication , rate retreatment surgical clipping endovascular coil small UIAs China .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Background : There lot controversy regard aneurysm leave untreated , aneurysms need treat clip coil . To date , clinical trial compare safety efficacy conservative treatment surgical clipping endovascular coil small UIAs . 2 . Study design : A multicenter prospective observation registry study . This study undertaken conform study protocol . Patients recruit December 2016 December 2018 . Patients eligible study meet inclusion criterion eligible follow exclusion criterion meet . 3 . Procedures : All patient interview multidisciplinary team consist vascular neurosurgeon , interventional neuroradiologists anesthetist . If patient meet inclusion criterion : unruptured aneurysm ≤5mm enrol follow 6 and12 month . Clinical observation , surgical clipping endovascular coil three treatment option UIAs . In general , UIA detect , need quit smoking , aggressively manage hypertension , control alcohol use . When aggressive treatment consider , treatment risk balance risk rupture .</detailed_description>
