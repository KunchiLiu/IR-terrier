	<brief_summary>This dietary intervention aim develop personalize targeted treatment NAFLD Hispanic child adolescent GG PNPLA3 variant . The investigator previous publication show particular demographic great 2-fold high liver fat compare GC CC individual . They also demonstrate significant gene*dietary sugar interaction significant association liver fat dietary sugar intake GG subject association GC CC individual . These study suggest different dietary strategy may differential effect reduce liver fat , depend PNPLA3 genotype . To confirm , investigator complete clinical trial 120 overweight obese Hispanic child ( 12 - 18 year ) clinically verify NAFLD randomize one two 12-week intervention : Group 1 ( standard care control group ) : Dietary intervention focus healthy eating ( n=60 ; 30GG + 30GC/CC ) Group 2 ( standard care + sugar reduction ) : Dietary intervention base healthy eat sugar reduction focus reduction sugary beverage add sugar towards goal 10 % daily calorie ( n=60 ; 30GG + 30GC/CC ) The following outcome measure intervention : Total liver fat fraction , visceral subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue volume magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) ; liver fibrosis magnetic resonance elastography ( MRE ) ; total body fat DEXA ; liver enzyme , fast insulin , glucose , lipid , free fatty acid inflammatory marker , gut microbiome , insulin glucose response oral glucose challenge . The investigator hypothesize liver fat fraction , liver fibrosis , metabolic outcome , fast 2h-glucose insulin , inflammatory biomarkers , show significantly great improvement sugar reduction relative control . In addition , investigator also hypothesize treatment*genotype interaction whereby reduction liver fat significantly great GG relative CC/CG subject .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>NAFLD : Children clinically diagnose NAFLD pediatric gastroenterology/liver disease clinic LACounty+USC Medical Center , CHLA , pediatric GI clinic eligible study . NAFLD define : 1 . Fatty liver indicate clinical assessment qualitative ultrasound ultrasound measure use diagnosis purpose upon entry study , liver fat fibrosis evaluate MR image MR elastography , describe ; 2 . Negative evaluation viral hepatitis , autoimmune liver disease , alpha1antitrypsin deficiency , Wilson 's disease , drug toxin exposure ; 3 . Elevated AST ALT ( define 1.5 time upper limit normal ) . Ethnicity : This study limit Hispanics high risk NAFLD , high frequency ( ~50 % ) atrisk PNPLA3 allele ( G ) , prior study target improvement liver fat NAFLD highrisk population . As ongoing study , Hispanic ethnicity base selfidentity participant well parent grandparent . Gender : Males female eligible study . Age : Children 12 18 year age eligible . In experience , child younger around 12 year age great 18 year would require different intervention/counseling strategy . Therefore , develop consistent `` ageneutral '' approach limit age range 1218 year . In addition , base ongoing experience , age range incorporate general window late pubertal development limit recruitment subject Tanner stage 3 great exclude potential confounding effect early pubertal transition . Puberty determine selfassessment pubertal maturation , include covariate . Weight status : Subjects eligible overweight obese , define BMI &gt; 85th percentile age gender . Diabetes : Presence type 1 2 diabetes , define fast plasma glucose &gt; 126 mg/dl , positive diabetes related antibody include ICA512 GAD . Participants test positive diabetes refer treatment . Subjects prediabetes eligible study Pregnancy : Women selfreport pregnant obtain positive pregnancy test result Visit 1 exclude . Furthermore , woman become pregnant course intervention , withdrawn study time ask longer participate . This order protect mother child radiation involve DEXA scan potential complication associate lowsugar diet . Medication : Taking medication know influence liver function , insulin action lipid level Selfprescribed dietary supplement : Taking nonprescription supplement could potentially affect liver function liver fat ( eg vitamin E fish oil ) Other metabolic disease : Diagnosis syndrome disease may influence insulin action secretion ( e.g. , maturityonset diabetes young , lipoatrophic diabetes , cystic fibrosis ) , body composition fat distribution ( e.g . Cushing syndrome , Down syndrome , lipodystrophy ) Other medical condition : Previously diagnose major illness since birth ( e.g . severe intrauterine growth retardation , chronic birth asphyxia , cancer ) Familial hyperlipidemia : Patients family history hyperlipidemia exclude , due particular genetic background disease , may bias result . Familial hyperlipidemia define LDL/cholesterol &gt; 160 mg/dL and/or triglyceride &gt; 200 mg/dL participant AND least one family member ( first degree : parent sibling ) . Smoking drinking : Selfreported current smoking participant ( 1 cigarette past week ) exclude due potential effect smoke weight control inflammatory status . Consumption alcohol regular basis ( 40g/day alcohol per day determine questionnaire ) also exclude due important role liver disease . Use recreational drug also exclusion criterion , due potent effect cannabinoids receptor weight status food intake . Participation weightloss exercise program : participant participate weightloss exercise program past three month exclude due potential effect weight status .</criteria>
