	<brief_title>Anxiety Reward Interaction Prediction Outcomes Anorexia Nervosa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective study understand effect anxiety reward responsiveness adolescent anorexia nervosa ( AN ) , interaction predict behavioral outcome subsequent intensive treatment . Investigators plan test , first time , acute activation threat relate emotional circuitry reciprocally alter reward circuit activity , degree modulation predict post treatment relapse . The severity AN , resistance intervention , potential quick return illness , risk long-term chronicity , premature death , well appreciate . Various form intensive treatment may succeed least partial weight restoration , yet early relapse unusually high . The appearance early life prodromal anxiety phenotype individual subsequently develop AN well document nearly universal . Anxiety proneness concert rigid self-discipline may therefore predispose substrate sudden morbid apprehension weight gain , may contribute subsequent behavior include vigilant scrutiny body size shape inflexible cognitive pattern regard food eating . In parallel , person restricting-type AN typically exhibit unease reticence expose novel , high reward environment . Most study find low fun-seeking , low novelty seek , reduce reward responsiveness AN . In line observation , functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) study demonstrate aberrant reward sensitivity reward circuit activation . However interaction anxiety reward circuit never interrogate . There substantial evidence distinct yet overlap neural system mediate approach/reward avoidance/anxiety , integrate balance switch behavior related predominant valence state . Thus investigator posit high degree reactivity cortico-limbic circuit underlie anxiety may contribute mechanistically functionally diminished initial responsiveness reward stimulus . This may translate clinically low motivation engage outpatient treatment - effect , low drive change behavior think pattern necessary maintaining gain improve , base expectancy benefit future outcome . The dynamic interaction reward anxiety system AN , dysregulation connectivity within system mediate behavioral outcome , previously test . Investigators investigate interaction use sequential fMRI paradigm novel integrate functional-by-structural connectivity individual complete standard treatment eat disorder unit . Investigators investigate neural circuitry may predict degree relapse subsequent 6 month .</detailed_description>
