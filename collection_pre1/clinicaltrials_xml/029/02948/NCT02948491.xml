	<detailed_description>This pragmatic , randomize control clinical trial blinding evaluator , perform order estimate effectiveness , six ( 6 ) month hospital discharge , music therapy intra-hospital evolution neurodevelopment preterm neonate ( gestational age 28 37weeks ) treat Neonatal Intensive Care Units ( NICU ) Bucaramanga Metropolitan Area . The study population premature neonates gestational age 28 37 week treat Neonatal Intensive Care Units ( NICU ) . They receive intra-hospital music therapy intervention compare premature neonate unit receive intervention without sound emission . The purpose identify difference behavior clinical parameter intra-hospital level well neurodevelopment six ( 6 ) month hospitalization . To begin recruitment study , neonatologist contact father/mother legal representative briefly explain purpose study procedure . After , father/mother legal representative interested allow neonate participate , put contact physiotherapist coordinate study fully explain research . The neonate 's participation study confirm informed consent form sign parent . Each subject randomly assign intervention group ( music therapy sound emission ) base previously generate random number table . The person possess table indicate project coordinator via telephone group neonate assign , stratify accord healthcare clinic . Since pragmatic trial , give nature intervention , trial mother need decide three music therapy option would like child receive : favorite song sing , favorite song obtain externally lullaby . This process choosing song do assign music therapy group , parent legal representative tell child could assign either two group , music therapy without sound emission . At time intervention parent , representative health professional know group preterm neonate assign . The intervention begin 24 hour birth admit clinic start collect data request admission form . The sample compose 90 neonate , 45 receive music therapy 45 receive intervention without sound emission . This sample estimate base alpha 0.05 power 0.9 . The intervention parameter volume intensity 55-65 decibel ( db ) . The intervention perform two physiotherapist alternate shift cover intervention day , since two people carry intervention day infant remain hospitalized . The exposure time 15 minute per day . A mini baffle ( JBL Bluetooth Go Brand ) individually place seal sterile sleeve put inside incubator top-center part crib align head neonate . The decibel measure Sonometer , place edge top access window right side incubator , face direction neonate 's ear . The variable register intervention : heart rate , respiratory rate , oxygen saturation blood pressure . Each variable measure intervention , 5 , 10 15 minute intervention , 5 minute intervention . During time , infant observe physical change register , include movement , cry , calm anything different ordinary daily development neonate . When infant discharge ( either pediatric intensive/intermediate care unit home ) , discharge report complete describe clinical condition infant leave unit . If infant continue hospitalize another unit , pediatric/intermediate unit , receive intervention leave clinic , parameter mention previously . In addition , nurse unit ( neonatal pediatric ) register change previous day use clinical monitoring data collection form , include variable : relevant change vital sign , diagnosis , treatment , etc . ( information obtain clinical chart print nursing report ) . All measurement procedure standardize prior application . The evaluator train field use pilot test , base need correction apply . In addition , 10 % measurement repeat verified field coordinator . All evaluator blind intervention assignment clinical status patient order prevent differential information bias . The father/mother , legal representative medical team decide withdraw infant study time reason consider valid . The reason withdrawal record last monitoring form complete . If infant discharge next day hospitalize , Bayley III evaluation development infant yet obtain , continue receive intervention hospital accord protocol describe study . If Bayley III evaluation obtain infant return clinic , infant treat would already part next phase study , involve neurodevelopment infant . When infant meet criterion ( correct developmental age hospitalize ) , researcher shall immediately contact father/mother legal representative perform Bayley III evaluation development infant , must perform later six ( 6 ) day post-hospitalization . This evaluation conduct laboratory Manuela Beltran University ( Gesell campus ) follow parameter : evaluator ( psychologist physiotherapist ) shall least 6 month prior experience work infant train use development scale prior application ; evaluator blind type intervention infant receiving ; evaluation ( psychological physiotherapeutic ) perform simultaneously professional able communicate among intervention , record monitor order ensure condition meet ; addition , prior warning , project coordinator periodically monitor evaluator one-way mirror locate laboratory . The evaluator electronically record data two laptop computer ( use Bayley III software ) locate far away laboratory , give electronic print copy Bayley III evaluation form coordinator leave laboratory . The two type registry must agree , serve strategy control quality data . This evaluation repeat six month hospitalization condition evaluator . During first six month hospitalization , coordinator call parent legal representative every 15 day , four objective : achieve adherence project , update contact data , identify health condition infant ; remind parent legal representative different check-ups child receive six month . To end , general follow-up form exist , contain personal data infant father/mother legal representative , intensive care unit treat , situation pertinent infant 's condition , review date post-hospitalization follow-up call ; review completion daily nursing form , intervention , 2 Bayley III evaluation , among others , order generate database collect data time establish . To handle miss data , several imputation technique consider base variable observe subject . In addition , result obtain without imputation compare explore effect miss value estimator . A sensitivity analysis perform high number value key variable miss . For statistical analysis , generalize linear regression model use repeat measurement ( identity link function normal distribution continuous response Log link function negative binomial distribution count response ) . This take account correlation structure within subject time-intervention interaction . The existence random slop intercept explore . All model compare Akaike model model hypothesis verify . All analysis perform STATA 14 .</detailed_description>
