	<brief_title>A Closed-loop Assessment Treatment Platform Mood Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific Aim 1 : Investigators recently construct beta version Moodify application , comprise multi-modal assessment module , several treatment module initial version closed-loop algorithm control treatment delivery . Utilizing extensive experience develop mobile assessment treatment tool Posit Science Corporation , investigator employ iterative development process incorporate feedback user ( focus group patient mood disorder ) , clinicians scientist ( project consultant ) achieve follow development goal : ( 1 ) Finalize Moodify 's closed-loop algorithm incorporate assessment module expand exist triage approach ; ( 2 ) Expand cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) function within app ; ( 3 ) Expand in-app bi-directional communication feature clinician user . At completion Specific Aim 1 , investigator mobile app suitable evaluation feasibility trial ( Specific Aim 2 ) . Specific Aim 2 : The investigator conduct single arm , open label feasibility field trial 25 participant meet criterion Major Depressive Disorder ( MDD ) . Participants ask engage experimental cognitive treatment spend six week engage 15 hour cognitive train adjunct standard clinical treatment . The experimental cognitive treatment deploy dictate closed loop predictive algorithm , patient data continuously accessible remote monitoring attend clinician Posit Science Corporation ( PSC ) clinician Principal Investigator , Dr. Thomas Van Vleet . Participants re-evaluated every two week treatment use , expect time completion training , 6 week , evaluate change cognitive function . Participants stop use assign program 6 week , return follow-up assessment evaluate endurance change cognitive function absence program use .</detailed_description>
