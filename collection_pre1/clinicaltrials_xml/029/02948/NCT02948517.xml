	<detailed_description>Time restrict feeding ( TRF ) novel form intermittent fast involves confine period food intake 8 h/d ( e.g . 10 6 pm ) without calorie counting . Recent finding short-term uncontrolled trial suggest TRF effective weight loss cardio-protection obese adult . In view pilot finding , great interest see whether subject adhere TRF long period time , see degree weight loss achieve TRF . Accordingly , aim trial : Aim 1 : To determine TRF implemented facilitate weight loss obese adult , Aim 2 : To determine TRF produce clinically meaningful reduction plasma lipid , blood pressure , insulin resistance , inflammatory marker . To test study objective , 14-week randomized , control , parallel-arm trial , divide 2 consecutive period : ( 1 ) 2-week baseline ; ( 2 ) 12-week weight loss , implement . Obese subject ( n = 40 ) randomize 1 2 group : ( 1 ) TRF ( n = 20 ) , ( 2 ) control ( n = 20 ) . This study first randomize control trial TRF , show TRF implement help obese individual lose weight low risk coronary heart disease .</detailed_description>
