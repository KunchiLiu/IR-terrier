	<brief_title>Study Nivolumab Following Preoperative Chemoradiotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>[ Phase Ib ] After preoperative CRT , sequentially administer nivolumab combination patient locally advance resectable rectal cancer . To evaluate safety nivolumab sequential combination therapy , onset dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) safety subsequent surgical therapy , decide recommend dose ( RD ) phase II part . [ Phase II ] To evaluate efficacy safety nivolumab sequentially administer combination RD determine phase Ib part , follow preoperative CRT patient locally advance resectable rectal cancer identify biomarkers relate therapeutic response . To also evaluate safety surgical therapy .</detailed_description>
