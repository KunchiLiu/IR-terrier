	<brief_summary>This multicenter , open-label study safety efficacy Quisinostat combination Paclitaxel + Carboplatin chemotherapy patient metastatic locally advanced epithelial ovarian cancer , primarily peritoneal fallopian tube carcinoma , resistant first line platinum Paclitaxel base chemotherapy . The study carry 5-8 Russian Belarusian site . A maximum 32 patient metastatic locally advanced epithelial ovarian cancer , primarily peritoneal fallopian tube carcinoma , resistant first line platinum Paclitaxel base chemotherapy , enrol study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Quisinostat , Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor , Combination With Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study consist screening period 3 week begin Quisinostat administration , follow Investigational product treatment period approximately 18 week ( 6 cycle 21 day cycle ) , safety follow-up 4 week last administration study therapy post-treatment follow-up aim determination progression-free survival , time disease progression overall survival rate study population . An interim analysis perform 10 patient evaluated efficacy . If 1 le 10 patient objective response ( OR ) , study stop early futility . After screen confirmation inclusion/exclusion criterion , patient ask come site start take Quisinostat . All patient receive Quisinostat dose 12 mg Day 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 11 treatment cycle . Administration Paclitaxel Carboplatin perform Day 7 cycle . The cycle repeat every 3 week ( 21 day ) . In case severe carboplatin hypersensitivity reaction , permit switch Cisplatin ( 75mg/m2 ) alternative Carboplatin subsequent cycle . Patients receive 6 cycle study therapy patient continue followed-up ORR , PFS , TTP , OS assessment study population . The Post-treatment follow include : - End treatment visit take place case treatment 's completion within 6 cycle study therapy . - Early discontinuation visit take place case early study termination ( completion 6 cycle ) . The patient ask make Early discontinuation visit later 4 week administration last Investigational product dose . After End treatment Early Discontinuation visit patient continue followed- 1 year start study treatment ICRR-determined progression ( death ) ( whichever earlier ) . This include tumor assessment every 6 week ( ±7 day ) . Following disease progression , Investigator contact patient relatives less 3 month order collect information concern patient 's survival status , cause death . This occur 1 year initial start treatment protocol .</detailed_description>
