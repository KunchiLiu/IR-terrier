	<brief_summary>This study raise two main hypothesis : 1 ) Asthmatics patient present bronchial hypersecretion differ phenotypically asthmatic patient without hypersecretion 2 ) mucin asthmatic patient hypersecretion bronchial mucus expression TLRs differ non-mucus hypersecretory asthmatic patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Asthma bronchial hypersecretion type asthma poorly study . Its pathogenesis well understood probably related innate impaired immunity , particularly `` toll-like receptor '' ( TLR ) secretory mucin ( MUC ) . Objectives 1 ) Define clinical inflammatory phenotype asthma bronchial hypersecretion mucus . 2 ) Compare type mucin present induce sputum ( IS ) patient without bronchial hypersecretion . 3 ) Determine expression TLRs IS peripheral blood asthmatic without bronchial hypersecretion . Method : Cross-sectional study include 43 asthmatic patient , 19 24 without bronchial hypersecretion . All patient underwent following : IS , spirometry , fractional exhale nitric oxide ( FeNO ) , prick test , total IgE blood albumin . Analysis mucin ( MUC2 , MUC5AC , MUC5B MUC1 ) determine ELISA expression TLR2 TLR4 flow cytometry . The level asthma control determine asthma control test questionnaire ( ACT ) quality life assess MiniAQLQ questionnaire .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Nonsmokers , asthma diagnose per Global INitiative Asthma ( GINA ) criterion maintenance treatment asthma , age 18 80 year . Patients exclude study respiratory tract infection and/or require use oral corticosteroid within 30 day prior inclusion ; concomitant disease ( sarcoidosis , lung cancer , pulmonary tuberculosis , bronchiectasis , nephropathy , rheumatic liver disease ) ; significant comorbidity could affect study result physician 's judgment ; cognitive impairment could limit comprehension subject study ability participate</criteria>
