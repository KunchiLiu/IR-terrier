	<brief_summary>This study single site , prospective , observational trial utilize wrist-worn accelerometer evaluate clinical outcome SCS PNS treatment chronic pain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Accelerometer Based Objective Clinical Outcomes Spinal Cord Stimulation ( SCS ) Peripheral Nerve Stimulation ( PNS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Up 150 evaluable subject recruit site ongoing basis . Evaluable subject define subject complete End Study visit . Each subject assign accelerometer data record seven-day period pre-implant trial collect baseline data . The accelerometer also worn trial period seven ( 7 ) day . If trial successful subject implant , subject wear accelerometer seven-day period least six ( 6 ) week post-permanent implant . The following assessment administer subject baseline ( pre-implant trial ) visit , end implant trial visit end study visit ( 8 week post-permanent implant ) : Numerical Rating Scale ( NRS ) 11-point scale pain ; SF-36 Health Survey ; Oswestry Disability Index ( ODI ) . Subjects treat neck pain also complete Neck Disability Index ( NDI ) . Additionally , subject ask complete subject diary record average daily NRS score day accelerometer wear .</detailed_description>
