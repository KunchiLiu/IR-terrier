	<brief_title>The Production Reactive Oxygen Species Response Glutathione Supplementation Acute Exercise</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ROS production response glutathione supplementation : Today , 387 million people worldwide suffer T2D number expect increase 592 million 2035 . Skeletal muscle responsible ~75 % total glucose uptake , make skeletal muscle quantitatively important tissue come insulin resistance ( 1 ) . It suggest oxidative stress may represent possible causative factor pathophysiology skeletal muscle insulin resistance . The link ROS skeletal muscle insulin resistance establish vitro vivo ( 2 , 3 ) , study actually measure ROS production skeletal muscle T2D patient ( 4-6 ) . Mitochondria source ROS , also major target oxidative damage ( 7 ) . The mitochondrial defense system oxidative stress relies endogenous antioxidant . Glutathione ( GSH ) abundant endogenous antioxidant cell thus , crucial protector oxidative stress insulin resistance ( 8 ) . Supporting , patient T2D decrease level GSH increase level oxidize GSH ( GSSG ) plasma ( 9 ) insulin resistant subject report increased mitochondrial ROS production well reduce GSH/GSSG ratio skeletal muscle compare healthy control ( 3 ) . In addition , 1 h glutathione infusion find increase glucose uptake patient T2D ~25 % improve redox environment , reflect increased GSH/GSSG ratio plasma ; effect see healthy control ( 10 ) . The effect prolong oral GSH supplementation skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity mitochondrial ROS production patient T2D , knowledge , never investigate . Research question 1 : Does oral GSH supplementation improve skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity patient T2D healthy control ? And , effect link beneficial redox state muscle cell ? Hypothesis : Oral GSH supplementation improve skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity patient T2D effect link reduce mitochondrial ROS production skeletal muscle . ROS production response acute exercise : Acute exercise induces mark increase transcription peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α ( PGC-1α ) ( 11 ) , therefore , PGC-1α believe play key role training-induced mitochondrial biogenesis ( 12 ) . Contraction rat skeletal muscle cell increase ROS production PGC-1α mRNA expression , presence antioxidant , ROS production reduce increase PGC-1α mRNA abolish ( 13 ) . Also , exercise combine allopurinol ( inhibitor ROS production ) severely attenuate magnitude exercise-induced increase PGC-1α mRNA rat , compare exercise alone ( 14 ) . These finding suggest PGC-1α , least part , regulate mechanism involve ROS . Furthermore , suggest ROS regulate PGC-1α via activation AMP-activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) ( 15 ) . Interestingly , subject insulin resistance decrease exercise-stimulated AMPK activity , compare lean control ( 16 , 17 ) , might explain attenuated training-induced mitochondrial biogenesis observe patient T2D ( 5 , 17 , 18 ) , ( 19 ) . Whether ROS production implicate abnormal training response know . Our current knowledge ROS response acute exercise derive study animal cell , study , knowledge , investigate link ROS mitochondrial biogenesis patient T2D response acute exercise . Research question 2 : Does exercise-induced increase ROS production require mitochondrial biogenesis response differ patient T2D healthy control ? If , low intensity exercise reduce transient ROS production thus , result higher mitochondrial biogenesis response patient T2D , compare exercise high intensity ? Hypothesis : Considering pathological condition T2D skeletal muscle ( i.e . high chronic ROS level ) , hypothesize low exercise intensity , lead low exercise-stimulated ROS production optimal stimulus ( i.e . high ) mitochondrial biogenesis patient T2D . Material methodology : 20 patient T2D ( non-insulin dependent ) 20 healthy control recruit study . The two group match age , weight maximal oxygen consumption ( VO2 max ) . Approach study : The study double blind randomize placebo control trial . At attendance laboratory ( except day screen ) , subject ask : - Report laboratory overnight fast state - Abstain alcohol physical activity 24 hour prior study day . - Repeat diet enclose 24-hour recall questionnaire prescribes ( subject also ask complete 24-hour dietary recall questionnaire first attendance laboratory ) Screening : Before subject include study , standard clinical examination conduct , include medical history , glycated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) ECG . If include study , subject undergoes 3 experimental day intervention . Test day 1 : - Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry-scan measure body composition , - Incremental exercise test determine exercise intensity elicit maximal fat oxidation ( Fatmax test ) - Incremental exercise test exhaustion determine VO2 max . Test day 2 : - Muscle biopsy vastus lateralis ( basal , immediately exercise cessation 90 min recovery ) - Acute exercise test bicycle ergometer 70 % VO2 max ( moderate intensity ) 50 % VO2 max ( low intensity ) . The two exercise test match total amount work ( kJ ) . 10 subject T2D 10 control subject randomize exercise test . Test day 3 : - Measurement rest metabolic rate canopy hood ( basal clamp ) - Intravenous glucose tolerance test - Hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp After experimental day , subject randomize placebo GSH supplementation instruct consume either 1000 mg GSH/day placebo daily ( 2 tablet morning 2 tablet even ) 4 week . Statistical consideration : The comparison group intervention perform use one-way two-way ANOVA test repeat measure , appropriate . Based variation show previous study expect 80 % power significance level P &lt; 0.05 , power calculation show 12 subject group sufficient regard mitochondrial functionality measurement insulin sensitivity . Data previous study investigate GSH healthy subject indicate 15 subject need order find difference parameter ( 3 ) .</detailed_description>
