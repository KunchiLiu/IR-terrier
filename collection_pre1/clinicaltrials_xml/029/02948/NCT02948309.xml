To date 160 clinical study mistletoe cancer therapy conduct varying quality ; therapy still controversial . Best evidence find increase health-related quality life ( HRQoL ) reduction side effect conventional therapy ( chemotherapy , radiation ) breast cancer patient . Mistletoe treatment describe safe well tolerate . There clinical study support use mistletoe extract management late stage cancer .
