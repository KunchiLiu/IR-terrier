	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients must histologically cytologically confirm advanced metastatic unresectable epithelial ovarian cancer , primary peritoneal cancer fallopian tube cancer relapse resistant ( recur less 6 month chemotherapy ) refractory ( progressed chemotherapy ) prior platinum taxanebased standard care systemic regimen . Histopathologic diagnosis must confirm Laboratory Pathology ( LP ) , NCI . Patients must measurable evaluable disease . Measurable disease define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record nonnodal lesion short axis nodal lesion ) great equal 20 mm conventional technique great equal 10 mm spiral CT scan . Patients must least 4 week previous therapy ( chemotherapy , hormonal therapy , radiation therapy , immunotherapy monoclonal antibody , alternative therapy investigational therapeutic agent ) . There limitation amount prior therapy allow . Patients ovarian cancer 4 week previous therapy find normal monocyte function ( unpublished ) . Patients cranial radiation therapy need complete great equal 8 week prior enrollment . Patients permit receive investigational imaging agent study . Patients major surgery must fully recover require recovery period great equal 4 week prior enrol study . Age great equal 18 year . Because dose adverse event data currently available use intraperitoneal monocyte , IFNalpha 2 IFNgamma patient &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study , eligible future pediatric trial . ECOG performance status less equal 1 ( Karnofsky great equal 70 % ) . Adequate renal function , define serum creatinine less equal 1.5 X upper limit normal ( ULN ) , measure creatinine clearance great equal 60 ml/min/1.73m^2 . Adequate hepatic function , define AST ALT level less equal 3 X ULN total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 X ULN , unless know diagnosis Gilbert syndrome , bilirubin le equal 5 mg/dl permit . Gilbert syndrome define elevate unconjugated bilirubin , conjugate ( direct ) bilirubin within normal range less 20 % total . Total bilirubin permit 5 mg/dl , patient historical reading consistent definition Gilbert syndrome prior enter study . Adequate bone marrow function , define absolute neutrophil ( ANC ) great equal 1,500/mm^3 ( great equal 1.5 X106/L ) , platelet count great equal 75,000/mm3 ( great equal 75 X10^6/L ) , hemoglobin great equal 10 mg/dL ( transfusion obtain hemoglobin great equal 10 mg/dL within 24 hour prior dose allow ) . The effect intraperitoneal monocyte , IFNalpha 2 , IFNgamma develop human fetus unknown . For reason interferon base animal data may cause fetal harm , woman childbearing potential ( excludes woman recurrent ovarian cancer ) men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Ability subject understand willingness sign write informed consent document . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients receive investigational agent ( exception image agent indicated inclusion criterion ) . Patients previously treat interferon ( e.g. , chronic active hepatitis ) . Patients metastasis outside abdominal cavity give intraperitoneal therapy unsure whether therapy would beneficial patient metastatic disease . Lack recovery prior adverse event Grade le equal 1 severity ( National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events [ NCI CTCAE ] v 4.03 ) ( except alopecia ) due therapy administer prior initiation study drug dose . Stable persistent grade 2 peripheral neuropathy may allow determined casebycase basis discretion Investigator interferon show cause exacerbate peripheral neuropathy . Patients active infection eligible , may become eligible infection resolve least 7 day completion antibiotic . Concomitant chronic ( daily almost daily great equal 1 month prior ) use steroids NSAIDS . Patients recent history ( within last 5 year ) autoimmune disease inflammatory disease exclude , interferon may worsen condition . Exceptions allow vitiligo hypothyroidism stable thyroid replacement medication &gt; 6 week . Impaired cardiac function clinically significant cardiac disease include follow : New York Heart Association class III IV congestive heart failure Myocardial infarction within last 12 month Subjects know impaired LVEF accord institutional standard History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition interferon agent use study . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation within last 12 month would limit compliance study requirement . Patients history neuropsychiatric disorder Major Depressive Disorder ( DSM 5 definition : http : //dsm.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.books.9780890425596.dsm04 ) require medical treatment eligible enroll , base black box warning . Exception patient experience transient postpartum depression resolve patient treatment &gt; 10 year . Patients take oral antidepressant normal sadness , bereavement , grief exclude . Pregnant woman exclude study interferon base animal data may cause fetal harm . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother interferon , breastfeed discontinue mother treated intraperitoneal interferon . These potential risk may also apply agent use study . Patients combination antiretroviral therapy treatment HIV ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction interferon alpha gamma . Patients receive medication substance potent inhibitor inducer CYP2C9 CYP2D6 ineligible .</criteria>
