	<brief_summary>Based current state knowledge gap literature conduct intervention study explore novel treatment rehabilitation patient Royal University Hospital ( RUH ) motor deficit follow stroke . This project follow objective : 1 . To determine cross-education , addition standard rehabilitation lead good recovery upper limb function stroke patient hemiparesis . 2 . To incorporate functional brain activation measure functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) examine neural mechanism associate change motor function paretic arm post-stroke . 3 . To use diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) tractography measure connectivity examine extent white matter tract thickness correlate preserve motor output patient post-stroke .</brief_summary>
