	<brief_title>Metformin Hydrochloride Ritonavir Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Multiple Myeloma Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety , tolerability feasibility administer metformin hydrochloride ( metformin ) /ritonavir combination therapy patient relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To characterize clinical activity two-drug combination assess disease response , response duration , ( relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma [ RRMM ] ) clinical benefit response . II . To assess progression-free survival , overall survival compliance patient start two-drug combination . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To describe plasma pharmacokinetics metformin ritonavir give combination . II . In relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( RRCLL ) , describe change pAKT , pAMPK , MCL-1 , circulate lymphocyte response treatment . OUTLINE : This dose escalation study . SINGLE AGENT STAGE : Patients receive metformin hydrochloride orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-7 absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . COMBINATION REGIMEN STAGE : Patients receive metformin hydrochloride PO BID ritonavir PO BID day 1-7 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day every 28 day .</detailed_description>
