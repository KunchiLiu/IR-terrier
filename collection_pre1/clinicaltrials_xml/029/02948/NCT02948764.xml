	<brief_summary>The main purpose study evaluate potential minimal invasive , vacuum-assisted biopsy ( VAB ) reliably diagnose pathological complete response ( pCR ) breast neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( NACT ) breast cancer patient . The study design multicenter , confirmative , one-armed , intra-individually-controlled , open , diagnostic trial , aim confirm applicability preoperative VAB patient NACT . Furthermore , aspire quantify rate concordant pathological finding ( pCR yes / ) biopsy surgical specimen .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Diagnosis Pathological Complete Response Vacuum-assisted Biopsy After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In clinical routine surgical treatment follow pre-operative chemotherapy ( NACT ) . However , recent study demonstrate shrink tumor need less surgical treatment indicate patient pCR could potentially spar surgery future . However , , prediction pCR NACT moderately accurate . This prospective , monocenter diagnostic trial aim explore minimal invasive biopsy ( MIB ) might overcome diagnostic challenge . Ultrasound guide VAB perform 600 breast cancer patient NACT directly prior surgery . There two trial visit specific trial . All visit routine visit . 1 . The first trial visit take place order provide patient detail information study , ' aim , VAB procedure , risk . The patient ask sign form inform consent . 2 . At second trial visit performance VAB ( =index test ) take place . This trial visit may vary patient , tumor , trial site characteristic may either : 1 . An ultrasound guide VAB 2 . A stereotactically / mammographically guide VAB . All possible VAB procedure setting ( outpatient clinic , operate room directly surgery ) equally accept . We allow every trial site choose adequate set trial siteÂ´s patient ' need . A visit follow necessary setting . Possible complication VAB procedure may occur biopsy take . The pathological result VAB specimen generally categorize follow : 1 . Residual tumor cell VAB specimen ( =non-pCR ) 2 . No residual tumor cell VAB specimen VAB representative former tumor region ( = '' pCR VAB '' ) 3 . No residual tumor cell VAB specimen VAB unclear representative former tumor region ( =possible sample error ) . These VABs categorize uninformative primary endpoint clinical trial . The result compare pathological examination surgical specimen .</detailed_description>
