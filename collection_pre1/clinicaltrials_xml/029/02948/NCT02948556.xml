	<brief_title>ME/CFS : Activity Patterns Autonomic Dysfunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Given endure debilitation poor quality life ME/CFS , study proposes identify important activity pattern ( e.g. , push-crash ) , negative life event autonomic dysfunction may associate non-improvement . This accomplished weekly online diary , objective measure ( actigraphy , heart rate monitor ) semi-structured phone interview . Non-improvement rarely study , commonly report outcome illness . For naturalistic study behavioral intervention trial , roughly 50 % ME/CFS patient report worsen unchanged illness . Also , patient 's self-management effort may ( paradoxically ) produce symptom worsen contribute illness non-improvement . Non-improvement may also biological relevance activity limitation sleep disruption ME/CFS associate autonomic dysregulation ( reduced heart rate variability ) . This ( R01 ) prospective observational six month study daily weekly vivo assessment would first look non-improvement relation ongoing patient activity autonomic function . Specific Aim 1 : To assess relation non-improvement prospectively assessed activity pattern life event . Hypothesis 1 : Non-improvement significantly associate dimensional variable : ( ) illness-exacerbating activity pattern ( e.g. , `` push-crash '' ) report home web diary ; ( b ) daily hassle assess web diary ; ( c ) negative life event report phone interview . Specific Aim 2 : To assess relation improvement prospectively assessed activity pattern life event . Hypothesis 2 : Improvement significantly associate : ( ) illness-moderating activity pattern ( e.g. , healthy pacing ) report home web diary ; ( b ) daily uplift assess web diary ; ( c ) positive life event assess phone interview . Specific Aim 3 : To assess relation activity pattern symptom . Hypothesis 3 : ( ) `` push-crash '' pattern predict great actigraphy variability symptom variability ; ( b ) `` limiting activity '' pattern associate low actigraphy count high symptom severity ; ( c ) healthy `` pace '' pattern associate moderate variability actigraphy symptom . Our secondary aim hypothesize autonomic dysregulation ( reduced heart rate variability [ HRV ] ) characteristic non-improvers patient limit activity pattern compare improver healthy pace pattern . The long-range goal develop new self-management protocol clearly identify non-improvement activity change . An important aspect new self-management protocol would identify early signal impend relapse , particularly HRV status , via home-use portable device could utilized patient doctor warn modify non-improvement activity , e.g. , excessive activity exercise , prevent behavioral collapse inactivity .</detailed_description>
