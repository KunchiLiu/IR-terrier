	<brief_title>Adding Mitomycin C Bacillus Calmette-Guerin ( BCG ) Adjuvant Intravesical Therapy High-risk , Non-Muscle-invasive Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS Background : Instillation Bacillus Calmette-Guerin ( BCG ) urinary bladder ( intravesical administration ) improve rate disease recurrence progression transurethral resection ( TUR ) high risk , non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer ( NMIBC ) , 30 % people still recur despite optimal therapy adjuvant intravesical BCG . The meta-analysis , include recent randomised phase 2 trial , suggest outcomes might improve use adjuvant intravesical regimen include Mitomycin C ( MMC ) BCG . These promising finding require corroboration definitive , large scale , randomise phase 3 trial use standard technique intravesical administration . General Aim : To determine efficacy safety MMC addition BCG patient NMIBC . Design : Open label , randomise , stratify , 2-arm multicentre phase 3 clinical trial . Population : The target population adult resect , high-risk NMIBC ( high grade Ta grade T1 ) suitable intravesical chemotherapy treatment . Key eligibility criterion include : prior transurethral resection visible tumour , adequate organ function , ECOG performance status 0-2 . Study Treatments : Arm A : Intravesical BCG Alone ( standard ) : Induction ( weekly x 6 ) , follow Maintenance ( monthly x 10 ) ; Arm B : Intravesical BCG + MMC ( experimental ) : Induction ( weekly x 9 ) , follow Maintenance ( monthly x 9 ) . Statistical Considerations : A sample size 500 ( follow 213 event observe ) provide 85 % power detect 10 % improvement DFS rate 2 year 70 % BCG alone 80 % BCG MMC ( hazard ratio 0.63 ) significance level 0.05 , allow 10 % non-compliance .</detailed_description>
