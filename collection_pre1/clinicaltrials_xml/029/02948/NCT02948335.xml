	<brief_summary>Microorganisms colonize hospital environment play important role transmission hospital acquire infection ( HAI ) multi-drug resistant organism . Previous study examine microorganisms hospital environment limit reliance target culture-based method result potentially miss unrecognized organism . Evidence suggest use microbiome analysis offer innovative strategy may improve understand HAI best prevent . This pilot longitudinal observational study aim characterize taxonomic composition microbial community environmental surface people environment prior follow introduction patient , caregiver , hospital staff newly construct inpatient care area St. Jude Children 's Research Hospital ( SJCRH ) . This propose study uniquely characterize evaluate hospital environment pediatric immunocompromised oncology patient population study past use advanced molecular technique microbiome analysis . PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : - To describe pattern microbial community hospital environment , patient occupancy newly construct hospital space . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : - To describe similarity difference environment microbial community human occupy environment newly occupy hospital space . - To describe pattern environment microbial community step disinfection ( manual cleaning chemical disinfectant Ultraviolet light disinfection machine ) patient discharge inpatient hospital environment . - To evaluate correlation environmental Adenosine Triphosphate ( ATP ) measure organism bioburden .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants recruit patient population SJCRH . Patients admit one protocol define inpatient room Kay Research Care Center ( KRCC ) enrol study . Participating patient ask provide stool , nasal swab , skin swab sample inpatient . Primary caregiver nurse assign patient 's room also ask provide nasal skin swab patient remain inpatient . These sample use characterize human microbiome comparison environmental microbiome .</detailed_description>
