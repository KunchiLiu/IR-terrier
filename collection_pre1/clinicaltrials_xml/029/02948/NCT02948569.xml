	<brief_summary>Metabolic syndrome increase risk development heart disease . Another condition associate metabolic syndrome fatty liver disease also refer nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) . Recently , drug block fatty acid synthesis develop treat cancer . These drug consider treatment NAFLD . A research test design measure liver fatty acid synthesis involve consumption sugary solution measurement blood fat six-hour period . The present study test drug 3-V Bioscience-2640 healthy subject characteristic metabolic syndrome 10 day treatment determine 50 mg/d significantly reduce liver fat synthesis lower liver fat storage .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation 3-V Bioscience-2640 Reduce de Novo Lipogenesis Subjects With Characteristics Metabolic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug 3-V Bioscience-2640 test previously subject cancer lipogenesis pathway important control cancer progression . Palmitate ( C16:0 ) , saturate , 16-carbon fatty acid biomarker lipogenesis present blood triglyceride ( TG ) , find reduce significantly . A second biomarker lipogenesis , malonyl carnitine , significantly increase patient expect . The present study test low dose ( 50 mg/d ) maximum dose previously administer . Here , subject men characteristic metabolic syndrome , otherwise healthy . The focus subject metabolic syndrome base fact future use drug patient NAFLD likely metabolic syndrome characteristic . In human , primary organ synthesize fatty acid liver , process occurs simple sugar consume diet . The carbon sugar clear liver become molecule acetyl-Coenzyme A , building block fatty acid . The Laboratory Elizabeth Parks , co-investigator , develop oral sugar tolerance test ( OSTT ) determine magnitude liver stimulation fatty acid synthesis individual consume oral bolus sugar . This test involve subject undergo IV infusion stable ( non-radioactive ) isotope ( 13C1-acetate ) . The isotope get incorporate fatty acid synthesize course infusion sugar stimulate lipogenesis , label abundance . Those labeled fatty acid detect present blood low-density lipoprotein ( VLDL ) component . In present study , investigator use protocol determine whether 10 day drug treatment ( one dose per day ) significantly reduce fast fructose-stimulated lipogenesis . The study divide 3 part support plan minor adjustment dose drug result first two research subject available order optimize suppression lipogenesis , also minimize side effect drug might . The study repeated-measures design , subject serve control . The study unblinded respect research staff work directly subject . However , laboratory personnel run biochemical analysis blind whether analyze baseline post-treatment sample .</detailed_description>
