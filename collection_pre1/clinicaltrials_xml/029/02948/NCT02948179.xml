	<brief_summary>Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease ( ADPKD ) common monogenic hereditary kidney disease human . ADPKD may affect generation ADPKD family probability ADPKD 50 % second generation gender . It confirm PKD1 PKD2 two pathogenic gene ADPKD . Nowadays , investigator establish effective gene detection technology platform PKD1/2 gene long fragment PCR next generation sequence . First , investigator perform genetic testing patient clinically diagnose ADPKD strong fertility desire , afraid hereditary risk . Using Preimplantation genetic diagnosis , include multiple anneal looping-based amplification cycle amplification technique , investigator successfully screen healthy embryo In Vitro Fertilization . Then investigator transplant embryo return parent . When baby bear , use umbilical cord blood gene detection , investigator confirm neonate inherit genetic defect form parent . The investigator succeed one couple . The investigator design multicenter clinical trial confirm procedures efficacy safety .</brief_summary>
