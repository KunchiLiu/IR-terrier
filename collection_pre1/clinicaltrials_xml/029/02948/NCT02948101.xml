	<brief_title>Pre-Conditioning Effects Anti-Macrophage Therapy Using PD 0360324 Recurrent Platinum-Resistant Epithelial Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : Cycle 1 42 day . Cycles 2 beyond 28 day . If participant find eligible take part study , receive PD 0360324 vein 30 minute Days 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 Cycle 1 . These 4 dos participant receive study drug . Starting Cycle 2 , participant take 1 cyclophosphamide capsule mouth time every day morning 1 cup ( 8 ounce ) water . The capsule chew , crush , cut . If participant forgets take dose , may take within 12 hour usual dosing time . If participant vomit within 30 minute take dose , take dose . If 12 hour since forget take dose participant vomit 30 minute since dose , take another dose . Participant wait take next dose schedule . Length Study : Participant may receive 4 dos PD 0360324 . Participant may continue receive cyclophosphamide long study doctor think best interest . Participant longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Participation study participant complete follow-up visit ( describe ) . Study Visits : On Day 1 Cycle 1 : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw within 6 hour participant 's dose study drug routine , biomarker , pharmacokinetic ( PK ) , pharmacodynamic ( PD ) test . PK test measure amount study drug body different time point . PD test measure level study drug participant 's body may affect disease . If participant become pregnant , blood also use pregnancy test . - Participant EKG . On Days 8 , 15 , 22 Cycle 1 : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw within 6 hour participant 's dose study drug routine , PK , PD test . On Day 8 , blood sample also use immune system test . - Participant EKG . Between Days 29 36 Cycle 1 : - Blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw immune system , PK , PD test . - Participant MRI CT scan . - Participant tumor biopsy immune system test . On Day 1 Cycles 2 beyond : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw routine biomarker test . - During Cycle 3 , blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw PK PD test . - During Cycle 2 , participant EKG . After Cycle 2 , participant EKG doctor think need . - If participant become pregnant doctor think need , part blood sample also use pregnancy test . At Day 1 Cycle 4 every even-numbered cycle ( Cycles 6 , 8 , 10 , ) , participant MRI CT scan . End-of-Dosing Visit : About 7 day participant 's last study drug dose : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw routine , immune system , biomarker , PK , PD test . - Participant EKG . - Participant MRI CT scan . - If study doctor think possible participant receive dos PD 0360324 , core tumor biopsy biomarker immune system test . Follow-Up Visits : About 30 90 day last dose study drug : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw routine biomarker test . - Participant EKG . - Participant MRI CT scan . This investigational study . PD 0360324 FDA approve commercially available . It currently use research purpose . Cyclophosphamide FDA approve commercially available treatment many type cancer , include ovarian cancer . The study doctor tell participant study drug design work . Up 15 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
