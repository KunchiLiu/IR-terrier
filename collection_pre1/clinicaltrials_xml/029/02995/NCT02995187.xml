	<brief_title>Study Apatinib Third-line Later Therapy Patients With Small Cell Lung Cancer ( SCLC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although fist-line therapy Cisplatin etoposide ( EP ) Carboplatin etoposide ( CE ) second-line therapy topotecan give , patient extensive small cell lung cancer ( ED-SCLC ) still relapse 2-year survival le 10 % . There standard treatment recommendation group patient fail second-line therapy good performance status . Apatinib approve second-line treatment advance gastric cancer . Several phase III clinical study non small cell lung cancer , liver cancer , colorectal cancer tumor also show apatinib less toxic side effect well patient tolerance . However , clinical application apatinib small cell lung cancer still lack evidence-based medicine . And clinical trial design prospectively investigate efficacy safety apatinib recurrent SCLC patient center .</detailed_description>
