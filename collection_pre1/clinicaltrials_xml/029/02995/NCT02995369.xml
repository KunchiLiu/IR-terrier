	<brief_title>DryShield vs Cotton Roll Isolation During Sealants Placement : Efficiency Patient Preference</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pit fissure caries account 80 90 percent caries permanent posterior teeth . Pit-and-fissure sealant use effectively prevent caries . By micromechanically bond teeth , provide physical barrier keep microorganisms food particle collect susceptible pit fissure , thus prevent caries initiation arrest caries progression . The effectiveness sealant caries prevention depend long-term retention , largely function meticulousness application : keep tooth surface free saliva contamination application polymerization critical . Low retention sealant attribute insufficient moisture control . Therefore , proper isolation teeth one important step place sealant ensure retention . Cotton roll isolation ( CRI ) widely use sealant placement , common method among pediatric dentist . Although effective , CRI challenge technique especially used young child : cotton roll cumbersome patient clinician . A previous study demonstrate new moisture control system Isolite , produce sealant retention rate comparable cotton roll isolation , decrease procedure time . DryShield ( DS ) recently introduce all-in-one isolation system . It similar Isolite combine task fluid evacuation , tongue cheek retraction , serve bite block , differs 's autoclavable provide illumination . Its design allow suction isolate half oral cavity time . Therefore , presumably facilitate sealant placement control environment , reduce chair time dentist . The goal study determine 1 ) placement time pit fissure sealant use DryShield system differ use cotton roll isolation technique ; 2 ) significant difference patient preference Dryshield cotton roll technique .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>The target population include healthy ( ASA I/II ) , cognitively normal child present one Montefiore pediatric dental clinic intake recall visit determine benefit sealant application , patient present solely sealant application appointment , examination do previous date ( within 6 month ) . The sample patient range 5 14 year age . They select base cooperative behavior display visit record previous encounter ( classify 3 4 accord Frankl Behavioral Rating Scale ) . Patients include study need least one erupt cariesfree permanent molar quadrant . Subjects must able speak English Spanish . There exclusion base race , gender , ethnicity . Uncooperative , medically compromised patient require few four sealant permanent molar exclude . Those provide appropriate assent consent exclude .</criteria>
