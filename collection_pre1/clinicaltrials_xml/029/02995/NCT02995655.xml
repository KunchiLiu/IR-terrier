	<brief_summary>The investigator hypothesize CX-01 disrupt bone marrow microenvironment increase cytotoxic effect azacitidine myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) hematopoietic stem cell disrupt High-mobility group box protein 1 ( HMGB1 ) interaction toll-like receptor 4 ( TLR4 ) receptor advance glycation end product ( RAGE ) , CXC chemokine CXCL12/chemokine receptor 4 ( CXCR4 ) axis , disrupt leukocyte vascular adhesion molecule . In addition , CX-01 may also help promote count recovery treatment give affinity platelet factor-4 ( PF4 ) . The selection CX-01 dose study relapse refractory MDS AML base upon dual requirement sufficient drug administer potential activity without clinically significant anticoagulation . The study dose chosen ( 4 mg/kg bolus follow 0.25 mg/kg/hour ) fulfill criterion . In addition , dose expect result serum level CX-01 significantly high IC90 identify preclinical study inhibition HMGB1-RAGE , toll-like receptor 2 ( TLR2 ) TLR4 interaction . Therefore , choose dose represent rational balance effective dose safety thrombocytopenic patient MDS AML . This dose previously establish safe tolerable combine cytarabine idarubicin patient AML .</brief_summary>
