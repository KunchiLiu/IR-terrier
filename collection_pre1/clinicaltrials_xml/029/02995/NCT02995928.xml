	<brief_summary>Decompressive craniectomy report treatment patient aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage ( aSAH ) . But prospective randomise control trial yet undertaken confirm effect.The purpose study determine whether decompressive craniectomy combine aneurysm clip surgery endovascular coil improve clinical outcome poor-grade aSAH patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Prophylactic Decompressive Craniectomy Poor-grade Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage ( aSAH ) worldwide health burden high fatality permanent disability rate . Decompressive craniectomy , beneficial patient malignant middle cerebral artery infarction , may indirectly relieve mass effect , decrease perihematomal tissue pressure , improve blood flow , reduce secondary brain damage improve outcome without damage brain due surgery . Early therapy either surgical clipping neuroradiologic intervention endovascular coil primary treatment aSAH . But whether decompressive craniectomy employ clip surgery immediately coil embolization still considerable controversy . 80 patient recruit trial 12 month . Follow-up take 6 month analysis report take 6 month .</detailed_description>
