	<brief_title>Low Intensity Laser Therapy Connective Tissue Graft Root Coverage Smokers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , parallel control clinical trial . The population evaluate study select Science Technology Institute - São José do Campos , College Dentistry . The selected smoker patient randomly allocate computer generate list : Group CTG ( n=15 ) : patient receive connective tissue graft procedure treat gingival recession simulation laser therapy application ( SHAM ) . Group CTG+ LLLT ( n=15 ) : patient receive connective tissue graft procedure treat gingival recession plus 8 application low-level-laser therapy ( LLLT ) treat gingival recession . All surgery perform expert periodontist . Before surgical procedure , patient enlighten cause consequence gingival recession prevention technique . Factors related origin gingival recession , toothbrush trauma inflammation cause biofilm , control instruction standardize brushing technique avoid influence hygiene method capable promote trauma soft tissue . Standardized dental floss toothbrush give patient . The surgical technique adopt recession defect trapezoidal-type coronally advanced flap ( CAF ) connective tissue graft ( CTG ) remove palate mucosa . Briefly , first incision palate perform perpendicularly long axis teeth , 2 3 mm apical gingival margin . The mesial-distal length incision determine length graft require cover recession . Because select recession maxillary canine premolar , length graft vary minimally ( 10-12mm ) . The second incision make parallel first one ( 1-2 mm apically parallel long axis teeth ) separate subepithelium connective tissue epithelial layer . The incision carry far enough apically provide 7- mm height connective tissue cover denude root surface . Afterward , another incision parallel long axis teeth start first incision perform separate subepithelium connective tissue periosteum . Then , connective tissue graft remove palate atraumatically possible . Single suture make palate ( 4-0 silk ) graft suture receptor site . The irradiation perform Gallium aluminum arsenide laser ( GaAlAs ) continuously emit wavelength 660 nm . Thirty milliwatt use 20 second total applied energy ( fluence ) 15 Joules per cm2 ( 3 Joules/ per point application time 4 second per point ) . Clinical , esthetic , comfort patient parameter assess baseline , 3 6 month procedure . Quantitative data record mean ± standard deviation ( SD ) , normality test use Shapiro-Wilk test . The probe depth ( PD ) , relative gingival recession ( RGR ) , clinical attachment level ( CAL ) , keratinize tissue thickness ( KTT ) , keratinize tissue width ( KTW ) , dentin hypersensitivity ( DH ) value examine two-way repeated measure ANOVA evaluate difference within group , follow Tukey test multiple comparison Shapiro-Wilk p value ≥ 0.05 . Those present Shapiro-Wilk p value &lt; 0.05 analyzed use Friedman test ( intragroup comparison ) Mann-Whitney test ( intergroup comparison ) . Patients ' esthetic discomfort measure use visual analog scale ( VAS ) analyze T-tests . The frequency complete root coverage compare use χ2 test . Intergroup root coverage esthetic score ( RES ) comparison perform T-test . A significance level 0.05 adopt .</detailed_description>
