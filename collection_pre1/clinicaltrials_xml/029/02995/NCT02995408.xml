	<detailed_description>According Center Disease Control 2012 , 14.6 per 1,000 child age 8 year old diagnosis Autism Spectrum Disorder ( ASD ) . Having child ASD associate medical expenditure 4.1-4.6 time child without autism , associate 8.4-9.5 time great general expenditure . Furthermore , child ASD likely use out-of-school behavioral health service child without developmental psychiatric diagnosis . Parents child ASD consistently show high level perceive distress anxiety related child-parent relationship , intellectual functioning , adaptive behavior , addition poorer health parent child typical development .

Resiliency multidimensional construct refers ability maintain adaptation effective functioning face stressor . Resiliency provide framework understand adjustment stress dynamic process . Allostasis refers capacity maintain stability physiological system face adversity . When expose chronic stressor , care child ASD , individual expend great deal energy attempt maintain allostasis ; lead metabolic wear tear describe allostatic load . Evidence accumulate wear tear mediate change basal stress system activity effect change dependent system . Allostatic load resilience therefore assess measure basal stress system activity ( HPA axis salivary alpha-amylase ) . Thus , research reduce parent ' exposure stress , moreover , improve parental response stress , may improve wellbeing parent child . Yet , treatment focus psychosocial need relation stress allostatic load parent child ASD develop . Research warrant examine intervene upon parental stress . This study aim design develop resiliency intervention provide support parent child ASD . This intervention modify version Dr. Park 's evidence-based 8-week multimodal treatment design promote adaptation stress promotion resiliency . The program 8 session , 1-1.5 hour week multi modal intervention incorporate relaxation technique , stress awareness discussion , adaptive strategy cop stress . This study refine 8-session group virtual-delivered resiliency treatment program consist 8 virtual group 1-1.5 hour session . The goal study would advance ultimate objective implement national parental resiliency program .</detailed_description>
