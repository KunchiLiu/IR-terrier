	<brief_summary>This retrospective observational multicenter cohort study base 271 consecutive HIV-HCV coinfected patient underwent liver transplantation ( LT ) 2002 2012 23 center Spain prospectively follow January 2016 . The main objective study analyze effectiveness safety 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTIs ) plus Raltegravir ( RAL ) - base antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) compare antiretroviral regimen liver transplant ( LT ) HIV-HCV co-infected recipient . In addition , investigator want know rejection rate patient take RAL-based ART comparison ART-regimens know efficacy safety direct antiviral agent ( DAAs ) HCV HIV-infected liver transplant recipient take RAL-based ART .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>With advent combine antiretroviral therapy ( cART ) , patient infect human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV ) living longer die illness acquire immunodeficiency syndrome . Although outcome liver transplantation ( LT ) HIV hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) -coinfected recipient poorer HIV-negative recipient pre-HAART era , recent evidence demonstrate comparable result population [ Roland ME ( 2006 ) , Terrault N ( 2012 ) ] . Currently , LT perform safely select HIV-1-infected patient [ Miro JM ( 2012 ) ] . However , number issue persist regard patient selection , postoperative management , treatment post-LT HCV recurrence interaction antiretroviral immunosuppressive agent . A key challenge post-transplant period management pharmacokinetic interaction immunosuppressive antiretroviral drug , particularly ritonavir-boosted HIV protease inhibitor ( PIs ) , involve high risk allograft rejection drug toxicity [ van Maarseveen EM ( 2012 ) ] . Frequent monitoring level calcineurin inhibitor ( e.g. , tacrolimus cyclosporine A ) necessary PIs introduce withdrawn HIV-infected SOT recipient , strong CYP450 inhibitor . Furthermore , pharmacokinetics corticosteroid mTOR inhibitor affect PIs . In contrast , non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) , also commonly use HAART regimens , CYP450 inducer may decrease serum level calcineurin inhibitor , result necessary increase dose prevent allograft rejection . Raltegravir ( RAL ) first HIV-1 integrase inhibitor approve clinical practice [ Powderly WG ( 2010 ) ] . It show highly effective well tolerated phase III clinical trial multidrug-experienced HIV- infect patient initial therapy treatment-naïve patient [ Powderly WG ( 2010 ) ] . RAL metabolize primarily liver via glucuronidation mediate UDP glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 ( UGT1A1 ) isoenzyme , although small percentage clear via kidney [ Kassahun K ( 2007 ) , Brainard DM ( 2011 ) ] . RAL substrate CYP450 neither inducer inhibitor main CYP450 enzymes P-glycoprotein- mediate transport . A favorable pharmacokinetic profile demonstrate HIV-infected LT recipients co-treated RAL calcineurin inhibitor ( cyclosporine , tacrolimus ) , mTOR inhibitor , corticosteroid [ van Maarseveen EM ( 2012 ) , Tricot L ( 2009 ) ] , indicate RAL probably well tolerate efficacious HIV-infected SOT recipient [ Tricot L ( 2009 ) ] . Preliminary data Hospital Clinic Barcelona ( Spain ) also suggest clinically relevant PK interaction RAL mycophenolic acid ( MPA ) , another widely use immunosuppressant [ Miro JM et al . ( 2011 ) ] . Moreover , RAL interactions new direct acting agent ( DAAs ) hepatitis C may use post-transplant period order treat HCV recurrence . The adequate antiretroviral regimen HIV-HCV coinfected patient undergo SOT establish . However , switch protease inhibitor NNRTI-based regimen RAL-based regimen time transplantation may option consider . Population : Multicenter cohort study base 271 consecutive HIV-HCV coinfected patient underwent LT 2002 2012 23 center Spain prospectively follow January 2016 . The study start 2006 , patient underwent LT 2002 2005 , information gather retrospectively participant follow January 2016 . Antiretroviral treatment give doctor charge patient base best clinical judgment . Therefore , clinical trial . Fifty-two percent ( 142 ) HIV-HCV coinfected LT recipient treat LT RAL plus 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTI ) [ lamivudine ( 3TC ) emtricitabine . ( FTC ) plus abacavir ( ABC ) tenofovir ( TDF ) ] [ Group 1 ] 48 % participant ( 129 ) treat ART regimens include boost PI NNRTIs [ Group 2 ] . Clinical Outcomes Measurements : 1 . HIV-related : incidence plasma RNA HIV viral rebound , level CD4+ T cell , incidence opportunistic infection LT week 48 , 96,132 240 ; 2 . LT-related : incidence acute chronic rejection ( biopsy-proven ) , liver re-transplantation death week 48 , 96 , 132 240 . 3 . HCV-related : incidence progression F3/F4 ( diagnose liver biopsy liver elastography ) , clinical decompensation liver cirrhosis week 48,96,132 240 plasma RNA HCV recurrence DAAs-based HCV treatment outcome ( 12 weeks-sustained virological response [ SVR12 ] ) ; All outcome compare Group 1 Group 2 . The clinical evaluation , laboratory test ( include cyclosporine tacrolimus serum level ) , CD4/CD8 subsets plasma RNA HIV viral load collect every 12 week 144 week accordance routine clinical practice . - Study start date : 1st January 2017 - Study end date : 31st July 2017 - First Patient : 1st Jan 2002 - Last patient : 31st Nov 2012 - Enrollment period already close 31-12-2011 . - Ongoing active follow-up . Last visit : January 2016 . Planned duration current analysis : 6 month ( 3 month : collect data ; 2 month : data management analysis ; 1 month : manuscript preparation ) . The simple size calculate base two primary endpoint ( incidence acute chronic rejection 48 week death whole follow-up period ) preliminary data observe solid organ transplant HIV-infected recipient Hospital Clinic Barcelona , Spain [ Manzardo C et al . ( 2015 ) ] . Accepting alpha risk 0.05 two-sided test 142 subject Group 1 129 Group 2 , statistical power two primary endpoint : 81 % , expect 25 % chronic acute rejection 48 week Group 1 41 % Group 2 ; 98 % , expect 13 % death Group 1 33 % Group 2 , end whole follow-up . Categorical variable express frequency ( percentage ) . Continuous variable express mean ± standard deviation median [ interquartile range ] accord normal non-normal distribution . A negative binomial Poisson regression perform compare incidence outcomes group interest . To compare level CD4+ T cell group interest lineal regression perform . All statistical analysis carry use Stata version 13 ( StataCorp . 2013 . Stata : Release 13 . Statistical Software . College Station , TX : StataCorp LP ) .</detailed_description>
