	<brief_summary>Knee osteoarthritis one common pathologies old people , lead cause pain disability . Symptoms include joint pain , stiffness , limited mobility , functional impairment proprioceptive deficit . When conservative treatment fail control symptom , total knee replacement ( TKR ) chosen treatment , mainly efficacy pain relief . In recent decade , surgical procedure soar , also arouse interest research patient ' outcome surgery . Despite TKR result good report outcome , surgery patient may manifest persistent pain problem affect functionality , stability , walk speed , proprioception , motor control , risk fall therefore quality life . In third case , deficiency may extend surgery six month one year , subject use achieve plateau functional value . Traditional rehabilitation program usually focus improve muscle strength lower limbs well functionality specific exercise achieve purpose , less extent balance proprioception exercise . Evidence support approach . Yet , task-oriented rehabilitation focus balance enhancement may one important factor complete rehabilitation , since benefit proprioceptive balance training may range good stability motor control , improvement static dynamic balance enhance functionality . Indeed , recent study show combination traditional functional rehabilitation together balance training may help restore functional deficit large extent usual therapy , base systematic review publish ( Moutzori , 2015 ) previous work ( Roig , 2016 ) , sensori-motor training acceptable adjust usual physiotherapy care . Looking effect preoperative training education TKR surgery , aim improve physical function , also manage expectation surgery well recovery . There low moderate evidence effect TKR pre-interventional training program , author argue effect small consider clinically relevant . In general , preoperative program usually focus functional strengthening exercise . Despite proprioception use clinical practice prevention recovery many orthopedics injury , amount evidence effect proprioceptive training program knee hip replacement large , works compare pre-habilitation post-rehabilitation program , systematically review evidence report efficacy balance proprioceptive pre-interventional training program . In framework , aim evaluate effect specific-task orient proprioceptive balance training program conduct patient undergo TKR surgery , compare effect outcomes achieved traditional strength-functional program , well specific prehabilitation training .</brief_summary>
