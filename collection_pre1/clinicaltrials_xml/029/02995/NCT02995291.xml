	<detailed_description>Dental procedure often require use local anesthesia . The common local anesthetic use 2 % Lidocaine 1:100,000 epinephrine . This local anesthetic achieve soft tissue anesthesia 180-300 minute pulpal anesthesia 60 minute . Unfortunately , long treatment relatively short duration lead loss anesthetic effect end intervention . Time-demanding dental appointment include oral periodontal surgery , extensive restorative treatment , even minor treatment complete dental student . Unfortunately , short act anesthetic Lidocaine use long lasting procedure , patient start feel pain , may difficult reestablish deep pulpal anesthesia repeat injection due tachyphylaxis . To avoid situation long-acting local anesthetic could select instead . The long-acting anesthetic available dentistry 0.5 % Bupivacaine HCl , 1:200,000 epinephrine . Bupivacaine produce soft tissue anesthesia 12 hour ( commonly 4 9 hour ) pulpal anesthesia 7 hour ( commonly 1.5 3 hour ) . Unfortunately , Bupivacaine often use non-surgical procedure due long soft tissue anesthesia outlast treatment several hour . The effect soft tissue anesthesia linger time administration long act local anesthetic Bupivacaine . This lead discomfort occasionally injury lip/tongue biting . Clinical trial show phentolamine mesylate ( PM ) , brand name OraVerse , effective reduce amount time reversal local anesthesia different dental anesthetic . However , date study investigate efficacy phentolamine mesylate reverse anesthesia induce use Bupivacaine . The objective propose research conduct pilot-scale randomized clinical trial evaluate difference time required return normal soft-tissue sensation function participant receive 0.5 % Bupivacaine HCl , 1:200,000 epinephrine , follow injection either 1 ) OraVerse ( phentolamine mesylate ) 2 ) sterile physiological water ( control ) . This advance knowledge Bupivacaine phentolamine mesylate current study evaluate reverse effect Bupivacaine PM . It hypothesize phentolamine mesylate reduce duration soft tissue anesthesia 2.5 hour compare control injection saline water . It anticipate study determine feasibility sample size need conduct full-scale multi-centre trial .</detailed_description>
