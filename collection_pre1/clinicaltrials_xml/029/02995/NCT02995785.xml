	<detailed_description>[ Background Objective ] First-aid skill training play important role education nurse . How implement stable efficient skill important . ( Kardong-Edgren , Oermann , Odom-Maryon , &amp; Ha , 2010 ) . Nursing first aid simulation often use teaching , teach significant significance cognitive , skill , satisfaction indicator achievement ( Cant &amp; Cooper , 2010 ) , simulation-based workshop , training , common enhance skill . ( Topping et al. , 2015 ) BLS basic first aid common sense basic knowledge resuscitation.In hospital BLS train basic knowledge chest compression technique . According Department Nursing first aid site performance check list find first aid equipment use unskilled , 25.5 % 2016/01 2016/06.The unfamiliar technique knowledge 109 nurse ( complete BLS ) follow : 33.9 % defibrillator , 25.7 % staff role position , 20.7 % first aid medication , 14.7 % intubation device LMA ( Laryngeal Mask Airway ) 105/10/1-105/10/17.This study design assist nurse enhance clinical ability safety patient first aid-related skill knowledge .

All subject pre-test first aid knowledge online test , follow pre-test first aid skill test Clinical Skills Center eight instructor 20 year work experience . After pre-test , experimental group give first aid skill simulation train guidance on-site discussion debriefing ( 75-min ) TMS online lecture ( 15-min ) .While traditional group give TMS online lecture ( 15-min ) . Two week later , post-test include first aid knowledge online test first aid skill test two group .
