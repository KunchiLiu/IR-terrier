	<brief_title>Patient Comfort Using Green vs. Yellow Pan Retinal Photocoagulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As demonstrate Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( DRS ) , panretinal photocoagulation ( PRP ) reduce risk severe vision loss patient proliferative diabetic retinopathy . The DRS recommend PRP treatment consist 1,200 - 1,600 laser burn 500 Âµm size , one half one burn width apart , apply peripheral retina scatter fashion . Most patient undergo PRP experience discomfort/pain procedure . Once present , pain affect number quality burn deliver indirectly increase number session require complete therapy.This may turn adversely affect patient compliance . Although retrobulbar peribulbar block provide adequate anesthesia PRP , anesthetic method carry rare serious risk retrobulbar hemorrhage . Previous study explore way reduce discomfort relate PRP , include optimization laser setting , oral topical analgesic , subconjunctival anesthesia , even acupuncture . Currently , green laser ( 521 - 532 nm wavelength ) commonly utilized perform PRP clinical practice . Yellow laser ( 577 nm wavelength ) recent interest treat diabetic macular edema micropulse subthreshold grid photocoagulation , extensively study PRP diabetic retinopathy . Compared short wavelength laser , yellow laser comports high transmission dense ocular medium less light scatter short wavelength minimize spot size reduces thermal spread . The limited literature compare green yellow laser PRP diabetic retinopathy show yellow laser require less power achieve retinal burn . In theory translate reduction perceive pain experienced PRP , however comparison green yellow laser regard yet directly examine quantify .</detailed_description>
