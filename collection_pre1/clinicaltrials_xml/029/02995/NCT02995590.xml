	<brief_summary>Recently , investigator demonstrate novel hyperpolarized helium tag Magnetic Resonance Image ( MRI ) technique capable directly , vivo , non-invasively measure physiological lung deformation regional basis . This unique imaging technique hold great promise assessing , validate , improve use Deformable image Registration ( DIR ) algorithm lung . Our long term aim apply hyperpolarized gas tag MRI study lung biomechanics , develop physiologically sound DIR algorithm lung , eventually improve radiotherapy lung cancer . The overall aim application optimize hyperpolarized helium tag MRI technology establish usefulness DIR assessment . Our first objective develop optimize methodology base 3 Dimensional ( 3D ) hyperpolarized helium tag MRI healthy subject , directly measure lung deformation inhalation exhalation . Our second objective develop physiologically sound digital thorax phantom base helium-3 tag MRI healthy subject demonstrate use DIR assessment lung . These phantom use evaluate range different DIR algorithm , compare error DIR-derived deformation vector field ground truth represent digital phantom . Successful completion aim yield novel methodology DIR assessment lung radiotherapy .</brief_summary>
