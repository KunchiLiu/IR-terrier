	<brief_summary>Mother-to-child transmission ( MTCT ) hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) remain major mode transmission high intermediate HBV endemic area , despite exist WHO immunoprophylaxis recommendation . This immunoprophylaxis regimen , give optimally , prevent 75-80 % HBV MTCT , optimal implementation difficult require administer monovalent HBV vaccine hepatitis B immunoglobulin ( HBIg ) within 24 hour birth . Due barrier give HBIg , World Health Organization ( WHO ) state , `` â€¦owing concern relate supply , safety cost , use HBIg feasible setting . '' Clearly , global control HBV transmission require improve MTCT prevention . Therefore , investigator hypothesize treat HBV early pregnancy lead undetectable HBV DNA level delivery prevention MTCT HBV without HBIg ; concept already prove HIV . Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( TDF ) , approve anti-HBV drug , promise prevent MTCT HBV due high potency hepatitis B safety record pregnant woman . A randomized , control clinical trial ( RCT ) necessary determine TDF give HBV-infected pregnant woman early pregnancy plus vaccine newborn decrease MTCT HBV without HBIg . However , embark RCT , several critical knowledge gap need address include ideal timing TDF initiation . The purpose proposal address knowledge gap .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator hypothesize anti-HBV therapy give late first early second trimester achieves undetectable HBV DNA delivery &gt; =95 % pregnant woman chronic hepatitis B . The one-arm , open-label , interventional study aim : 1 , To estimate time complete HBV DNA suppression ( &lt; 100 IU/ml ) 170 HBV DNA positive woman start TDF late first early second trimester ; estimate proportion woman HBV DNA &lt; 100 IU/ml delivery . 2 , To address potential barrier efficacy implement TDF early pregnancy prevent mother-to-child transmission hepatitis B . The investigator measure potential barrier acceptability effectiveness intervention : adherence , potential hepatitis B flare mother ( safety ) , proportion hepatitis B infection offspring 1 year age ( efficacy ) .</detailed_description>
