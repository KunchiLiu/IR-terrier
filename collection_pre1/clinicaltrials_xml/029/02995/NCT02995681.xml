	<brief_summary>People live Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) problem balance high incidence fall compare similar age . Pulmonary rehabilitation recommend people COPD , however , train program typically include balance training fall prevention strategy . In study , patient COPD report problem balance fall last two year assign treatment group ( balance training plus pulmonary rehabilitation ) control group ( standard pulmonary rehabilitation ) . We record number fall use monthly diary evaluate patient 's balance , strength , confidence quality life .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Balance Training Fall Reduction COPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) lead cause morbidity mortality Canada . In addition lung impairment , secondary effect disease well establish include impairment muscle function exercise capacity . However , individual COPD also mark deficit balance increase risk fall 3-5 time higher annual fall rate similar age . The underlying mechanism remain unclear , several factor implicate include decreased physical activity , muscle weakness , alter trunk mechanic , comorbidities , hypoxemia proprioceptive deficit . Given unique impairment profile , tailor approach balance train fall prevention need COPD . Pulmonary rehabilitation ( PR ) integral therapeutic intervention individual COPD . The program typically consist supervised exercise , disease-specific education , psychological social support . Balance train fall prevention strategy currently include international guideline PR program include balance assessment . We previously show exercise component traditional PR minimal effect measure balance fall risk . We conduct RCT examine effect balance training alongside PR , specifically address profile balance deficit identify COPD . Tailored balance training alongside PR result clinically important improvement balance performance compare PR alone . Given result , opportunity build exist experience test effect intervention fall . The purpose study establish efficacy tailored balance exercise program reducing fall individual COPD enrol PR . If participation tailor balance training decrease fall compare usual PR , approach represent innovative potential cost-saving strategy prevent fall reduce associate healthcare utilization COPD . Our result relevant guide clinical policy-based decision making , give large population individual COPD potential severe consequence fall population . The primary objective study evaluate long-term effect tailor balance exercise rate fall individual COPD enrol PR . Secondary objective determine 1 ) long-term effect program measure balance , balance confidence muscle strength ; 2 ) cost-utility program .</detailed_description>
