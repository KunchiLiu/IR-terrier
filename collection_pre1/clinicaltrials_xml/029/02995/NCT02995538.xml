	<brief_summary>The objective project develop Neurogenetics patient database bio repository - include clinical information regard history , physical examination , laboratory test include genetic testing ( NextGen sequence include whole exome whole genome sequencing , SNParray , etc . ) , neuroradiology study , neurophysiology study - order clinically deem appropriate , natural history clinical longitudinal follow-up use de-identified information registry/ repository , appropriate clinical translational research .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neurogenetics Patient Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients see neurogenetics clinic clinical phenotype pedigree supportive genetic disease consider study . Autosomal recessive inheritance suggest least two affected sib healthy parent may also unaffected child . Autosomal dominant inheritance suggest multiple affected family member multiple generation . Lack family history could suggestive autosomal recessive inheritance de novo autosomal dominant inheritance . Informed consent complete prior research procedure genetic test . Patients see neurogenetics clinic approach participate Neurogenetics study routine clinic visit . Parents pediatric patient see clinic ask provide write informed consent . Following informed consent , deidentified patient information enter database study team member . If participation biorepository also approve , available store specimen deidentified locate specific laboratory collaborator laboratory In case know Neurogenetics patient die , Legally Authorized Representative ( next kin ) decease patient may approach provide permission research data store specimen include study . Again , protect health information ( include sample clinically obtain biopsy autopsy ) secure de-identified participation . Immediate family member study ( affected individual , affect unaffected sibling parent ) goal study least family trio ( mother , father , affect child ) . In case , family may decease individual bank DNA available . If family interested include sample , write consent obtain decedent 's next-of-kin executor decedent ' estate . Family history suggestive genetic disease undiagnosed available diagnosis method consider study extensive genetic evaluation . Affected individual beside affect unaffected sibling parent consider study . The research subject see member study team discus research protocol obtain informed consent . They also see clinic final result research study genetic counseling discus result . If need see clinic clinical reason relate research . Methodology : For Goal 1 : A neurogenetics clinic set 2 clinical child neurologist genetic counselor , undiagnosed patient potential neurogenetic disease assess clinically appropriate testing order . Patients diagnose neurogenetic disorder also follow longitudinal care reassessment appropriate . For Goal 2 : Informed consent obtain pretesting genetic counseling provide . Clinically appropriate testing order include blood draw , urine specimen collection , buccal swab collection need tissue biopsy sample . DNA sample test left appropriate clinical testing use storage biorepository appropriate research test . Next generation sequencing , clinically appropriate order available commercial lab approve patient 's insurance company . If insurance coverage deny research testing order informed consent pretesting counseling , do collaborative lab . For Goal 3 : A patient database de-identified clinical information , laboratory analysis , image study genetic study maintain . A biorepository blood DNA/ tissue sample maintain appropriate clinical / collaborator laboratory . The patient database facilitate identification recruitment potential eligible subject participation patient specific translational research study help good delineate patient condition help potential therapy development future . Collaborators identify multiple different field university Pittsburgh help offer research next generation testing , bioinformatics analysis , basic science researcher help functional analysis potential novel genes/ variant unknown significance . The vision initiative able take data novel new genetic testing undiagnosed patient bench functional characterization - hope would pave road repurposing currently available drug personalize care rare patient help development novel treatment future . Experimental Approach : Blood draw order clinically indicate extra tube draw research purpose : Up 20 mL whole blood collect EDTA tube . DNA extract per standard lab protocol . For deceased individual use bank source DNA available . Next kin sign proxy consent decease individual . Whole Exome Sequencing ( exome amplification sequence ) and/or Whole Genome Sequencing do accord lab protocol send commercial laboratory laboratory consultation one collaborators/consultants protocol . Research whole exome collaborator laboratory offer patient , whose insurance provider cover clinical testing . The bioinformatics analysis provide collaborator use analyze raw data NGS . Standard analysis use look variant specific gene know cause genetic disorder . Any variant whole exome whole genome sequence find compare publicly available exomes/genomes dbSNP database , 1000 Genome Project NHLBI ( http : //evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/ ) exclude common variant compare data available ClinVar ( http : //www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/ ) well ExAC ( ExAC.broadinstitute.org ) . Variants pathogenic prediction use available software PolyPhen SIFT use analysis well . Comparing variant find affect individual find parent reduces number candidate variant . For autosomal dominant disorder , strategy discover de novo cod variant , assume neither parent non-expressing carrier disorder . In contrast , recessive disorder parent carry one disease-causing variant identify affected child . For X- linked disorder , mother carrier disease unless occur de novo proband . Conservation score GERP score ( Genomic Evolutionary Rate Profiling ) note well . Alteration highly conserve residue likely functionally significant . Genes multiple transcript require special consideration . In situation , effect estimation limit canonical transcript , variant candidate gene confirm Sanger sequence CLIA certify lab . Assessment Physiologic Relevance : Based publish literature report similar experiment , anticipate identify &lt; 10 candidate gene perhaps one . If one candidate gene identify , assess likely physiologic relevance number way . First , amino acid change assess conservation across evolution . Alteration highly conserve residue likely functionally significant . Next ass predict tissue expression examination EST databases `` virtual northern blot '' . Amino acid change predict significantly alter protein structure assess functional study . Time Frame Subsequent Studies : The propose sequencing study complete relatively expediently sample obtain . Additional time require bioinformatic analysis . Data obtain project use PI prepare grant application systematically characterize underlie molecular defect patient significant pedigree evidence genetic disorder , patient recognize genetic syndrome unknown cause . Preliminary data obtain project also lead additional grant application study identify defect . The blood draw do affected individual , healthy parent unaffected sibling phlebotomy lab Children 's Hospital UPMC UPMC facility patient see lab personnel . The blood draw take 5-10 minute . Alternate arrangement may make individual local phlebotomy lab obtain specimens ship investigator .</detailed_description>
