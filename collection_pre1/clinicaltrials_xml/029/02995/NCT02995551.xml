	<brief_summary>There two cartilage structure knee joint call meniscus . A torn meniscus cause either small large trauma degenerative age-related tear . Arthroscopic meniscal surgery common orthopedic procedure , high-quality study investigate efficacy meniscal surgery younger patient ( i.e . 40 year young ) comparison non-surgical treatment . The purpose study determine strategy early arthroscopic meniscal surgery ( repair resection ) superior strategy initial individualize supervised exercise therapy include patient education option later surgery need improve pain , function quality life young patient ( 18-40 year ) meniscal tear . The hypothesis patient treat early arthroscopic meniscal surgery improve patient treat exercise education .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Danish Rct Exercise Versus Arthroscopic Meniscal Surgery Young Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Arthroscopic meniscal surgery common orthopedic procedure . In Denmark , meniscal surgery double around 9.000 yearly procedure 2000 17.000 2011 , total number meniscal surgery exceed 150.000 period . Similar trend observe US , 700.000 orthopedic procedure carry annually . Numerous randomize control trial ( RCT ) investigate efficacy meniscal surgery compare placebo surgery , addition non-surgical treatment direct comparison exercise middle-aged older patient . However , RCTs investigate efficacy meniscal surgery younger patient ( i.e . 40 year young ) comparison non-surgical treatment . In contrast middle-aged older adult degenerative meniscal tear unknown origin , tear young adult ( 18-40 year ) traumatic origin ( i.e . sport related trauma ) , highlight need high-quality trial young population . The aim RCT investigate early arthroscopic meniscal surgery ( repair resection ) superior individualize supervised exercise therapy education , option later surgery need , improve pain , function quality life young patient ( 18-40 year ) meniscal tear . The study hypothesis patient randomize surgery improve significantly pain , function quality life 12 month randomize exercise education . Patients fulfil eligibility criterion willing participate study randomize one two group baseline assessment follow-up 3 , 6 12 month . 1 . Arthroscopic meniscal surgery : Arthroscopic meniscal repair resection conduct discretion operate surgeon ( determine surgeon visual confirmation exact knee pathology extend meniscal tear scope ) . After surgery , patient receive standard rehabilitation postoperative period depend type surgery , since differs patient resection repair . A standard folder exercise give partial meniscectomy ensure minimum level rehabilitation surgery across hospital . 2 . Exercise therapy patient education : Patients allocate exercise therapy education participate 12-week ( 2 exercise session per week ) supervise neuromuscular strengthening exercise program tailor 18-40 year old patient meniscal tear . Furthermore , participate patient education program develop interview pilot study participant , experience Good Life osteoArthritis Denmark ( GLA : D ) program patient knee hip pain . Both exercise education take place number private physiotherapy clinic associate GLA : D program , specifically trained supervise lead treatment study . A similar exercise program educational program show effective improving pain , function quality life patient type knee injury knee pain . Observational cohort : Patients fulfil eligibility unwilling participate randomize study patient 18-40 year age knee pain fulfill criterion ask participate observational cohort questionnaire RCT , follow usual clinical practice .</detailed_description>
