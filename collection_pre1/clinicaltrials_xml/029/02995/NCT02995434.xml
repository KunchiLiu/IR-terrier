	<brief_summary>This study seek explore efficacy virtual reality ( VR ) experience practical adjunctive therapeutic intervention self-management chronic pain associated cancer survival . A comparative control interventional trial qualitative interpretative-descriptive exploration undertaken 100 Cancer survivor experience chronic pain . Participants randomly assign either virtual reality ( VR ) therapy group immersive multimedia control group ( 50 subject ) . They undertake either series virtual reality intervention , 2D multimedia control session home period month . The intervention use daily month enable customization therapy record data long enough period time account individual short-term change pain . The VR session consist use VR head mount display ( HMD ) computer explore interactive immersive environment . The control group expose similar 2D computer base multimedia experience ( without VR headset ) home computer . Pre , post pain test score quality sleep assessment record use standardized tool . At end study , ten subject demonstrate improvement pain use VR expereince select invite explore measurable change neurological activity use pre post exposure MRI study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study seek explore efficacy VR experience practical therapeutic intervention self-management chronic pain associated cancer survival . This work inform clinical study future research potential us immersive multimedia treatment cancer associate pain . Furthermore , help identify optimal immersive multimedia environment use chronic pain application , practical determinant implementation immersive multimedia wider practice , provide good theoretical understanding mechanism whereby immersive multimedia work chronic pain . JUSTIFICATION Cancer survivorship refers individual remain cancer free minimum 5 year . Due development great outcomes associated cancer therapy management , number individual survive cancer risen considerably past decade . Currently , 65 % adult 80 % child expect live least 5 year post cancer diagnosis . However , , survivorship associate debilitate chronic pain impact negatively quality life . Reviews suggest 40 % individual survive cancer remain cancer relate chronic pain . With rapidly emerge immersive multimedia technology clinical work field , would appear immersive multimedia may significant potential use adjunctive therapeutic measure pain control . However , little work do establish potential use immersive multimedia management chronic cancer pain date , work immersive multimedia pain management focus acute pain via distraction . Several researcher recommend investigation immersive multimedia chronic , long term pain , research team complete pilot study 2015 establish best method approach use immersive multimedia chronic pain condition . OBJECTIVES To determine immersive multimedia therapy effective adjunctive intervention management chronic pain cancer survivor ? 1 . Can exposure immersive multimedia environment adjunctive pain-relieving measure provide pain-reducing experience chronic cancer pain patient ? 2 . How long ( ) therapeutic effect immersive multimedia last exposure chronic cancer pain patient ? 3 . Are significant side effect immersive multimedia exposure chronic cancer pain patient ? 4 . Do identifiable neurological change occur fMRI pre post immersive multimedia exposure ? RESEARCH METHODS A longitudinal mixed-methods study evaluate impact immersive multimedia chronic pain cancer survivor propose consist comparative control interventional trial qualitative interpretative-descriptive exploration . 1 . Interventional Trial ( Quantitative ) : Participants randomly assign either VR therapy group control group ( 50 subject ) . They undertake either series immersive VR intervention , control session ( use 2D multimedia personal computer ) home period month . To ensure multi-dimensional aspect chronic pain experienced individual measure adequately , pain assessment tool select address different aspect participant 's ' chronic pain functional capacity . To measure impact VR participant 's pain intensity , Visual Analog Scale use VR control experience , pre post exposure 10 minute interval . In order measure change pain therapy experience , overall sleep quality , end week , participant also ask complete post-intervention questionnaire : Health Survey ( Short-Form 12 ) , McGill Pain Questionnaire , Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index , also brief Virtual Reality Immersion Tool ( assess immersive find experience week ) . 2 . Interpretive Description Study ( qualitative ) : A Qualitative Interpretative-Descriptive Exploration undertaken alongside trial allow open exploration participant experience understanding perception associate use immersive multimedia impact upon chronic pain . An interpretative description ( ID ) approach use aspect study . This methodology allow inductive descriptive analysis phenomenon , choose ideal small scale study , allow generation theme , pattern theory associate patient 's experience . Following completion clinical trial participant send exploratory questionnaire discover perception immersive multimedia value ( ) control chronic pain . In questionnaire also invite participate one two focus group interview . Data analyze used support purposeful sampling individual take part follow focus-group interview , include subject range diverse opinion idea . As themes category emerge data researcher seek adapt focus-group interview sample purpose strengthen emerge theory pattern include individual help define characteristic themes category . Data Analysis Quantitative Data : Descriptive inferential statistical analysis perform pain score . For face-value quantitative indicator potential effect univariate descriptive statistic employ . Data analyze central tendency , dispersion ( standard deviation , interquartile range ) , skewness kurtosis use SPSS statistical analysis software establish distribution variance . Likewise , quantitative data questionnaire analyse fashion . Data explore difference pain scale VR group control group time point analyze indication change immediately follow experience use Linear Mixed Effects Modelling use SPSS software . Qualitative Data : The focus-group interview audiotaped . The questionnaire open text result transcription focus group record Nvivo 11.0 qualitative data analysis software read , re-read cod thematic element PIs .</detailed_description>
