	<detailed_description>STUDY DESIGN . An experimental , 1-group , single-centre trial conduct stroke patient perform 2 RAGT session : 1 ) walking Lokomat accord regular RAGT setting 2 ) walk Lokomat different level guidance force ( 60 % , 80 % 100 % ) . PATIENT RECRUITMENT . We aim recruit 20 stroke patient St. Ursula Rehabilitation Centre Herk-de-Stad , Belgium . RESTRICTIONS AND PROHIBITIONS . Patients instructed consume food , alcohol , caffeine nicotine least 3h prior intervention . Usual medication intake allow small amount water . PROCEDURE . Patients test 2 RAGT session 2 separate day within week ( one day in-between ) . During first session patient walk Lokomat accord regular therapy setting 30 minute ( i.e . minimum tolerable guidance force ( GF ) , minimal tolerable body weight support ( BWS ) maximum tolerable walk speed ) . During second session patient walk Lokomat 3 different level guidance force ( 60 % , 80 % 100 % ) 10 minute amount body weight support walk speed first session . On separate day intervention , patient seat 10 minute rest value ( respiratory gas heart rate ) assess ( order measure Resting Metabolic Rate ) . In addition , informed consent baseline clinical demographic characteristic obtain . At start intervention , mouth mask , heart rate monitor gait analysis system apply . After seated rest period 5 minute , patient walk total 30 minute respiratory gas heart rate monitor continuously . The Borg rating perceive exertion register every 3 minute . The intervention terminate early relative absolute indication present reported American Heart Association patient unable continue walk . Walking session control time day therapy . RANDOMIZATION &amp; BLINDING . During second RAGT session , level GF randomize patient blind amount guidance force . MATERIALS . A flexible facemask ( adult facemask , small/medium , Cortex , Germany ) , lightweight chest carry gas analysis system ( Metamax 3B , Cortex , Germany ) Bluetooth heart rate belt ( Polar H7 , Polar Electro , Finland ) use measure metabolic cardiorespiratory parameter . At start measurement , gas ( room air reference gas ( 17.4 % O2 5.1 % CO2 ) ) volume ( 3L syringe ) calibrations breath-by-breath gas analysis system perform accordance manufacturer 's instruction . STATISTICAL ANALYSIS . Statistics perform use SPSS ( IBM , Chicago , IL ) . The significance level set 5 % . Descriptive statistic calculate baseline patient characteristic . Means standard deviation calculate continuous variable frequency percentages categorical variable . To investigate effect time effect different level guidance force , repeat measure ANOVAs ( within subject factor ) analyze . In case significant difference , posthoc analysis interpret . To investigate effect guidance force relate patient 's baseline level GF ( i.e . GF regular therapy setting ) correlational analysis perform baseline GF consider covariate . To compare recommended guideline , one sample t-tests perform .</detailed_description>
