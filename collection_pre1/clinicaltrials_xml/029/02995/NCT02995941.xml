	<brief_title>Shoulder Symptom Irritability Scale : A Single-Blinded Observational Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Physical therapists regularly make decision regard intervention intensity base upon pathoanatomy , symptom irritability , impairment identification , reliability validity classify patient symptom irritability unknown . Purpose Examine reliability use shoulder symptom irritability classification system purpose determine appropriate treatment intensity . Design Prospective repeated-measures single-blinded design determine reliability cross-sectional design utilized aid determine construct validity . Methods Twenty-five ( 25 ) raters train make paired rating 90 subject primary complaint shoulder pain . Raters record shoulder symptom irritability level also select appropriate intervention intensity subject . Raters also ask choose anticipated intervention subject . Data Analysis Prevalence-adjusted , bias-adjusted Kappa ordinal scale ( PABAK-OS ) primary measure reliability . Dependent upon distribution data , form Kappa may utilize analyze data appropriately . To determine difference reliability group without clinical specialization , independent test utilized Î± = 0.05 . Lastly , analysis variance post-hoc analysis use compare functional disability across different level irritability . Significance This study address key gap understand symptom irritability relate clinical decision making . It expect symptom irritability logically drive intervention selection intensity rehabilitation intervention .</detailed_description>
