	<brief_summary>Asthma impose significant burden US term morbidity , cost society , individual suffering , loss productivity mortality . African Americans ( AA ) Hispanic/Latinos ( H/L ) bear disproportionate share morbidity . Despite national guideline asthma treatment , gap group white stable widening . The need pragmatic research address continue burden widely recognize . Patients use asthma reliever inhaler provide immediate relief symptom . Controller inhaler ( inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS ) ) intend use regularly prevent symptom attack . Guidelines suggest use daily , fixed basis , mild asthma . However , adherence patient implementation evidence-based guideline recommendation clinicians poor . Gap analysis suggest difficult improve adherence current recommendation without complex resource-intensive intervention . Studies examine symptom-activated use ICS trigger use reliever medication . The Investigators call approach PARTICS - Patient Activated Reliever-Triggered Inhaled CorticoSteroid . Explanatory , non-real world study suggest PARTICS produce 50 % reduction asthma attack compare usual care , reduce ICS use half . These study perform pre-selected population , represent le 5 % asthma patient . The previous study do repeat education adherence check intervention control arm . We consult AA H/L patient , health care provider , leader professional society , advocacy group , health policy leader , pharmacist , pharmaceutical manufacturer . All group indicate asthma decision making would change demonstrated implement PARTICS improves important asthma outcome reduce exacerbation . The Investigators design study stakeholder determine whether PARTICS improve outcome important patient superimpose background provider-educated standard care Asthma IQ system . The Investigators propose study entitle PREPARE : Patient Empowered Strategy Reduce Asthma Morbidity Highly Impacted Populations . The Investigators aim determine whether PARTICS reduce asthma morbidity AA H/L . The primary outcome asthma exacerbation . The secondary outcome include additional outcome important patient ( i.e . day lose work school , asthma control , &amp; asthma quality life ) . The study broad input involvement multiple stakeholder group study design , implementation , commitment dissemination . AA H/L patient advocate involve continue play central role phase study .</brief_summary>
