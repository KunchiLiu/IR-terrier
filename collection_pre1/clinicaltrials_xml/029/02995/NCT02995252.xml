	<brief_summary>This observational , longitudinal , prospective study sample collection evaluation future therapy disease progression chronic hepatitis B C. Participants see annual basis optional additional visit 10 year provide sample research evaluation disease progression . In addition , longitudinal sub-study treatment hepatitis B involve 2 year treatment tenofovir alafenamide blood collection optional liver biopsy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The HOPE Study : Characterizing Patients With Hepatitis B C</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatitis B virus chronically infect 350 million people worldwide one million Americans approximately 4.1 million individual ( 1.6 % ) US population infect hepatitis C. These infection lead cause end-stage liver disease , cancer indication liver transplantation world . Both transmit sexually , perinatally percutaneously . Coinfected human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) accelerate progression liver disease , due share mode transmission , chronic hepatitis B C disproportionately affect people live HIV . The primary objective study Identify people viral hepatitis provide linkage care future therapy evaluation disease progression ; well characterize hepatitis B treat hepatitis C directly act antiviral course 10 year . The study , include participant questionnaire phlebotomy , administer on-site clinical facility District Columbia Maryland , Institute Human Virology University Maryland , Baltimore . The cohort design study research question respect liver disease , disease pathogenesis use genomics , proteomics , immunologic disease model . Secondary objective include study immunopathogenesis hepatitis B C disease progression . In addition , invaluable opportunity evaluate long term effect hepatitis C clearance direct acting antiviral , along biomarker profile ( ) diagnosis outcome . Moreover , serve catchment protocol select appropriate participant novel hepatitis B C therapeutic trial . This study include standard-of-care treatment sub-study patient hepatitis B . In sub-study , participant receive approve nucleos ( ) ide analogue prospectively observe therapy change liver fibrosis . The integrated clinic provide optimal environment adherence engagement medical care education decrease transmission risk infection . The study establish blood specimen repository participant include research database use prospectively test future hypothesis .</detailed_description>
