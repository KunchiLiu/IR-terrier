	<brief_title>Characterising Changes Muscle Quantity Quality Patients Requiring ECMO Oxygen During Critical Illness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Admission intensive care unit ( ICU ) critical illness typically associate profound physical impairment include peripheral skeletal muscle waste dysfunction . These effect demonstrate rapid onset point ICU admission , affect high illness acuity great level , contribute development intensive care unit-acquired weakness ( ICU-AW ) define severe upper low limb muscle weakness . Muscle structure traditionally evaluate use complex scanning approach compute tomography dual energy x-ray absorptiometry , however number caveat use clinical environment critical care . Ionising radiation involve precludes use large population , especially performance sequential measurement . Whilst magnetic resonance imaging avoids concern , practical limitation exist around scan time accessibility . In addition , image modality require transfer ICU environment , restrict application acutely unwell , unstable patient . Finally , addition expense , nature image use approach mean limited number muscle may assess one time . Ultrasound emerged recent year technique significant clinical utility assess monitoring trajectory change muscle acute critical illness . A range parameter muscle architecture quality measure data critical illness population grow . Advantages ultrasound include feasibility bedside assessment , non-ionising , non-invasive effort-independent equipment readily available critical care environment . Ultrasound image robust clinimetric property predictive utility morbidity clinical endpoint include mortality hospital readmission . A number observational cohort study conduct sequential measurement range respiratory peripheral skeletal muscle group critical illness , characterise decline muscle quantity quality result acute insult . However study date include assessment abdominal muscle critically ill patient necessary core stability , trunk control postural maintenance therefore significant clinical importance rehabilitation process . In addition , whilst hypoxia find associate great muscle attenuation , study examine relative change muscle patient receive extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ECMO ) . ECMO ventilator support therapy primarily deliver critically ill patient severe respiratory failure hypoxic state correct . The aim study therefore characterise sequential change across respiratory , trunk peripheral skeletal muscle critically ill patient require ECMO .</detailed_description>
