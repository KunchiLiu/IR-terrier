	<brief_summary>A randomized , control trial conduct evaluate effect post-discharge falls prevention program patient neurological disease disorder . The objective study evaluate implement falls prevention program effective reduce subsequent fall re-hospitalizations , improve gait , strength balance older adult hospital discharge . Patients Baptist Health Neuroscience Center randomize day discharge receive exercise fall prevention program , deliver Baptist Health physical therapist , educational pamphlet fall prevention . Baseline follow assessment gait , balance , strength complete regular interval examine effect exercise program . In addition , participant survey find recent falls hospitalization . This minimal risk study assessment involve condition subject likely encounter daily basis . The risk exercise intervention also one might expect community exercise program . Potential benefit include reduce hospitalization and/or emergency visit relate fall intervention group , increase activity level improve fall efficacy intervention group , increase system capacity Baptist Health deliver fall prevention program .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>After sign consent form , eligible participant complete health-related questionnaire undergo gait , balance strength test time discharge randomly refer intervention ( n=30 ) control group ( n=30 ) . Participants recruit target sample ( n=60 ) reach . Randomization coin flip . Measures ( intervention control group ) : The evaluation involve non-invasive assessment physical functioning conduct physical therapist include balance , gait , low limb strength test . Both group test physical therapist baseline 3 , 6 month post-discharge . A 12-month follow-up call make participant ask fall physical activity . The physical therapist conduct test different physical therapist deliver intervention ( Otago Exercise Program ) . All test complete 60-90 minute session Baptist Outpatient Rehabilitation Center . The participant complete questionnaire include information health fall history , fall self-efficacy ( Falls Efficacy Scale ) , hospitalization , doctor ' visit , emergency department visit . The participant also complete physical assessment include gait analysis use instrumented mat ( GaitRite ) collect data temporo-spatial parameter gait prefer gait speed gait street cross simulation regular time : 7 second . Street cross regular time allowance calculate base pre-programmed pedestrian street signal , give pedestrian 20 second cross four-lane street . The GaitRite thin mat pressure sensor ; integrate software web-cam measure calculate gait temporo-spatial parameter . The video use visual reference inspect task quality control data collection review use analysis way . The physical assessment also include BalanceMaster ( Natus Medical , Inc. ) , fix force plate measure vertical force exert foot measure center gravity position postural control , Tinneti Balance Assessment , low limb strength test use 30-second chair stand test , Timed Up Go ( TUG ) assessment mobility test . Procedures ( intervention control group ) : The participant complete gait , balance chair-rise test random order . They ask priori wear non-slip sock provide research team . During preferred gait speed condition , participant instruct walk GAITRiteÂ® prefer speed usually daily activity . During simulated street cross condition , participant instruct cross street pedestrian light turn green complete cross within time allow displayed pedestrian light video . The video include audio traffic noise realistic road cross environment , display intersection situation subject position intersection , sidewalk look oncoming motor vehicle traffic direction . A pedestrian light countdown also display screen . Thus , functional dual-task paradigm use include visual cue participant interpret cue adjust gait accordingly . A familiarization trial complete , follow three record trial condition . The order gait condition randomize participant . Participants free stop participate anytime without need provide reason . Exercise Intervention ( intervention group ) : The intervention comprehensive program address aging-related functional decline , fear fall inactivity . It target adults history fall at-risk fall . Following assessment , participant assign control group receive standard educational information fall prevention , individualized exercise program prescribe delivered physical therapist ( Otago Exercise Program Falls Prevention ) . The program easy-to-implement affordable exercise program individual high risk fall . The program design model person-centered customized individual need . It include set leg muscle strengthen balance retraining exercise , walk plan . Subjects go Baptist Outpatient Rehabilitation Center discharge baseline assessment exercise prescription , biweekly first 2 month ( 4 time ) exercise progression follow ups , month 3 first re-assessment , 6 month booster session second re-assessment . At 12 month phone call follow do ask fall physical activity . The assessment session cover Baptist Health Neuroscience Center Rehabilitation Services . As part program , participant 30 minute exercise three time per week , walk continuously 30 minute least two time per week six month . Participants record ( physical activity log ) day exercise walk provide information physical therapist subsequent visit and/or call . Physical therapist prescribe exercise base large selection available program manual . The participant receive illustration explanation exercise need . They receive booklet exercise instruction ankle cuff weight . The physical therapist exercise progression increase intensity and/or difficulty subsequent client visit Baptist Outpatient Rehabilitation Center . The program also include monthly telephone call study staff maintain motivation , collect information fall , answer question visit .</detailed_description>
