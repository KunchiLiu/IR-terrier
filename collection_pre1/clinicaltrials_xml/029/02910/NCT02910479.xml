	<brief_summary>E-Celsius device use measure gastrointestinal temperature compose ingestible capsule measure temperature well transportable module receive data capsule . This device allow measure body temperature ( ± 0.2 ° C ) transit pill digestive tract maximum sampling frequency 30 second . The main risk related device relate biocompatibility ( material use capsule shell , level contamination gastrointestinal environment due defect plastic envelope pill lack hygiene , previously test clinical trial ; see section 10.2 ) . It compare conventional method estimate central temperature continuously gastrointestinal data obtain e-Celsius device . The main objective research validate extent gastrointestinal temperature obtain device test consist ingestible electronic capsule data reception monitor . Secondary objective pursue : - Assess effect ingestion cold drink temperature read take via e-device Celsius , esophageal probe rectal probe . - Explore thermal homogeneity digestive tract . - Evaluate internal memory capsule data forward capacity . This protocol also measure reliability measurement system compare standard use health staff today .</brief_summary>
