	<detailed_description>At EUS , pancreatic mass identify , patient randomize undergo sample use one two FNB needle . All patient undergo sample pancreatic mass use needle needle use first base randomization . Subsequent pass perform alternate needle onsite diagnosis establish use either needle type , pass perform onsite diagnostic adequacy . However , minimum least one pas maximum 8 pass perform use needle type . The number pass need achieve diagnostic adequacy use needle document . Four dedicated pass perform use initial randomization sequence cell block . Two pass perform use needle type specimen preserve formalin sent cell block processing . If doctor obtain enough tissue study needle , another needle different gauge ( 19 25 ) use . This also maximum 8 pass . Information number needle use , many pass perform , problem needle collect . If enough tissue available pass establish diagnosis , subject ask come back another time repeat procedure .</detailed_description>
