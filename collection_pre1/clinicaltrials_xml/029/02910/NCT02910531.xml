	<brief_title>Lipoic Acid Supplement Cystine Stone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cystinuria rare inherit autosomal recessive disorder kidney result defect dibasic amino acid transporter renal proximal tubule small intestine . Supersaturation cystine urine produce crystal precipitate form calculus , cause obstruction , infection , chronic kidney disease ( Chillar√≥n 2010 ) . One potential therapeutic thiol-containing compound alpha-lipoic acid ( thioctic acid , 5- ( 1,2-dithiolan-3- yl ) pentanoic acid , ALA ) . It over-the-counter supplement antioxidant property . Once ALA transport cell , reduce dihydrolipoic acid ( DHLA ) . Both ALA DHLA direct antioxidant activity ( Scholich 1989 ) , regenerate endogenous antioxidant include ascorbic acid vitamin E. It also increase intracellular coenzyme Q10 glutathione level . ALA DHLA also additional biochemical effect metal chelators , reactive oxygen specie scavenger , modulators signal transduction several pathway ( Gomes 2014 ) . While potential therapeutic effect ALA study number disease include , example , Alzheimer 's disease , obesity , cardiovascular disease , hypertension , several cancer ( Gomes 2014 ) , efficacy ALA best study type 2 diabetic peripheral neuropathy ( Ziegler 2011 ) . In lab , result mouse model cystinuria show ALA markedly slow initiation cystine stone formation well growth exist stone . Given history clinical medicine , importantly , base upon positive finding ALA effectiveness mouse model cystinuria , propose pilot study use molecule cystinuric patient .</detailed_description>
