For example , researcher able train heavy drinker decrease weekly alcohol intake7 chocolate-lovers reduce chocolate intake .

Participants first train via computerized training task inhibit responses high-calorie ( unhealthy ) food , approach alternative low-calorie , high-nutrient ( healthy ) food , order test task efficacy . The investigator include train task incorporate nap component consistent Hu colleague evaluate utility sleep condition maintain training-related change inhibition approach tendency one week .
