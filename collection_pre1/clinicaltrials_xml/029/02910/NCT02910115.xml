	<brief_title>Cooling Uterus C-section After Dysfunctional Labor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two hundred patient draw pregnant woman require cesarean delivery dysfunctional labor . Dysfunctional labor define cervical dilation 3 centimeter , active labor without cervical change 2 hour . Patients randomly assign study group control group , group 100 patient . Following delivery fetus , patient control group IV Pitocin administer per usual protocol uterus wrap lab sponge soak room-temperature saline uterine incision close per attend obstetrician 's usual practice . Additional utero-tonic medication may give improve uterine contraction . In study group , follow delivery fetus , uterus externalize usual fashion , except uterus wrap lap sponge saturate sterile , iced normal saline . Additional utero-tonic medication may also give study group improve uterine contraction . Immediately delivery fetus prior delivery placenta , amniotic fluid blood surgical field aspirate suction canister . This amount fluid suction canister note subtracted amount fluid canister conclusion surgery . At conclusion surgery , blood loss calculate measure content blood suction canister , weigh surgical sponge . Post surgical vaginal bleeding monitor calculated patient discharge labor delivery unit . Use utero-tonic medication record . At conclusion study , amount blood loss utero-tonic drug control study group compare . The need additional surgery , hysterectomy D &amp; C , compare two group .</detailed_description>
