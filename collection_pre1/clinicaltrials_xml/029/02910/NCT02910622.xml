	<brief_summary>The choice treatment cancer systemic way - chemotherapy , hormone therapy target therapy - currently define criterion population group individual . These expensive treatment - financial term quality life - effective administer unnecessarily predictive test response give individual . For breast cancer , usual treatment include first surgery adjuvant therapy ( chemotherapy , hormonal therapy ... ) whose effectiveness assess many year occurrence recurrence metastasis . These systemic treatment also administer surgery reduce tumor volume secondarily allow less mutilating surgery : principle treatment neo adjuvant . In case , efficiency evaluate quickly . In practice , patient breast cancer suspicion biopsy confirm diagnosis define parameter ( hormone receptor , cytological grade , receptor monoclonal antibody ... ) guide appropriate type treatment . Tumor size evaluate neo adjuvant pre-treatment imaging : mammography , ultrasound MRI . At end medication , evaluation response achieve radiology surgery . Pathological examination evaluate precise response criterion Chevallier / Sataloff . An ex vivo test predict response cell different chemotherapy regimen , oncogramme , develop Oncomedics , young company whose technology derive University Limoges . Clinical response / histopathological could compare reasonable time ( 2-6 month ) , result oncogramme propose Oncomedics whether efficiency obtain vivo predict ex vivo test . It metastatic set available target biopsy assessment response . The management ovarian cancer advance stage also benefit radiological histopathological evaluation strategy systemic treatment compare vivo result predict ex vivo Oncomedics .</brief_summary>
