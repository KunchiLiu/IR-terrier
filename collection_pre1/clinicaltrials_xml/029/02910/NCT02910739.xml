	<brief_summary>This study consist Part I Part II . The purpose Part I compare plasma pharmacokinetics verubecestat ( MK-8931 ) follow administration single oral dose 40 mg MK-8931 participant moderate hepatic insufficiency ( HI ) healthy match control . A safety pharmacokinetic analysis perform order support decision continue part II . If decision continue part II make , participant mild HI enrol receive single oral dose MK-8931 40mg . If healthy participant Part I meet match criterion Part II additional healthy participant enrol .</brief_summary>
