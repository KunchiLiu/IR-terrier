	<brief_summary>Angina common symptom coronary heart disease among woman unlike men woman stenosis coronary artery . In large proportion woman , coronary microvascular dysfunction ( CMD ) think cause angina . However , CMD also demonstrable asymptomatic population , may merely innocent bystander relate presence cardiovascular risk factor rather cause angina symptom . The aim study determine whether comprehensive intervention feasible result improvement angina microvascular function patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comprehensive Treatment Angina Women With Microvascular Dysfunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Coronary microvascular dysfunction find associate significant adverse prognosis . The condition strongly associate increased future risk major cardiovascular event , frequent hospital readmission , continue angina loss quality life compare general population . Pathophysiology microvessel disease : In heart 95 % blood flow control microcirculation . When oxygen demand increase normal response microvessels reduce resistance order increase flow . When microvessels dysfunctional blood flow large coronary vessel increase sufficiently meet oxygen demand , thus lead ischemia pain . The main cause think dysfunction endothelium structural change perivascular fibrosis change vascular smooth muscle cell . In addition vasodilation endothelium play central role atherosclerotic process generate vasoactive anticoagulant factor important mediator thrombosis . Coronary microvessel dysfunction ( CMD ) show strong predictor poor cardiovascular prognosis wide group cardiac patient . Rationale intervention : In woman angina obstructive stenosis coronary vessel cardiovascular risk factor common . Among 3000 Danish woman angina open artery , 12 % diabetes , 48 % hypertension , 20 % smoker mean body mass index 27 kg/m2 . In randomized trial among overweight patient coronary artery disease large weight loss intensive exercise training show significantly improve coronary flow velocity reserve ( CFVR ) . Small study address risk factor individually suggest effect peripheral vascular function exercise training , statin therapy , weight loss . Pre-diabetes find eighty percent patient strongly associate microvessel disease . Lifestyle intervention significantly reduce risk develop diabetes . Medical treatment target microvessel dysfunction patient angina systematically test small study indicate effect beta-blockers Angiotensin Converting Enzyme ( ACE ) -inhibition coronary microvessel function . Small study indicate effect individual intervention mainly function peripheral vessel . A comprehensive intervention simultaneously target CMD angina previously attempt . The rationale present intervention test concept woman angina CMD.The study pilot study , successful , expand multicentre , intervention trial prognostic outcome . A large study show improved prognosis crucial importance treatment patient group become part guideline .</detailed_description>
