	<detailed_description>To assess effectiveness introduction UBT , step wedge cluster randomize design employ monitor maternal health outcome among vaginal delivery occur participate facility study phase describe : Baseline phase : A baseline phase conduct participate site train introduction UBT PPH management . This phase consist prospective data collection establish baseline rate key study outcome . Step 1 intervention phase : In phase , participate site randomize half receive training use UBT PPH management subsequent introduction standard practice half continue data collection without UBT introduction . Step 2 intervention phase : In phase , remain site receive training use UBT PPH management subsequent introduction standard practice . During phase , participate site continue data collection document study outcome use UBT standard practice . To assess safety acceptability use UBT PPH management , nest cohort analysis do among woman diagnose PPH step wedge trial . The investigator assess rate treatment postpartum infection examine acceptability care provide among follow two cohort woman : UBT group : All woman diagnose PPH follow vaginal delivery attempt UBT placement ( include successful unsuccessful placement ) .
