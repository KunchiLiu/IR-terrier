	<brief_title>Effectiveness Bethanechol Chloride Early Bladder Training Prevention Bladder Dysfunction After Radical Hysterectomy Cervical Cancer Stage IB - IIA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cervical cancer third common cancer woman worldwide , breast colorectal cancer . Molecular biology firmly establish causal relationship persistent infection high risk human papilloma virus ( HPV ) genotypes cervical cancer . Cervical cancer stage IB1 select IIA 1 lesion without extensive vaginal involvement treat either RH pelvic lymph node dissection ( PLD ) primary chemoradiation . Bladder dysfunction common complication radical hysterectomy . The incidence approximate 10-80 % . Management bladder dysfunction continuous urethral catheterization clean intermittent self-catheterization . Prolonged urethral catheterization may increase risk urinary tract infection . Early postoperative bladder train consist schedule clamp trans-urethral catheter every 3 h unclamping trans-urethral catheter 15 min entire day . Bethanechol chloride cholinergic drug may enhance detrusor muscle contraction , result high maximum flow rate , low postvoid residual urine . This study conduct compare effectiveness bethanechol chloride early bladder training prevention bladder dysfunction radical hysterectomy cervical cancer stage IB - IIA .</detailed_description>
