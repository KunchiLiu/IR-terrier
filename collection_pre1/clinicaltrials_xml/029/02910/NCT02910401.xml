	<brief_summary>Rhinovirus ( RV ) infection represent common cause asthma exacerbation child adolescent . The investigator hypothesize immune response generate nose allergic rhinitics asthmatic underlie subsequent systemic modulation immune system , - susceptible individual ( i.e. , pre-existing asthma ) - modify nasal milieu responsible asthma exacerbation . Open label single center study asthmatic well allergic rhinitis ( AR ) healthy control . All subject undergo good manufacturing practice ( GMP ) RV16 inoculation response compare 3 cohort .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Response Rhinovirus Challenge</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary objective : To determine whether RV increase expression interleukin ( IL ) -25 transcript nasal epithelial cell asthma AR control cohorts peak infection ( day 3 4 ) . To determine whether RV increase low respiratory symptom asthma AR control cohort . To determine whether asthmatic allergic rhinitics demonstrate increase severity infection comparison control subject . Secondary objective : 1 . To determine whether asthmatic AR cohort demonstrate increase IL-25 transcript expression course RV infection 2 . To determine whether asthmatic AR cohort demonstrate increase expression mRNA transcript type 2 cytokine-inducing profile ( IL-33 thymic stromal lymphopoietin ( TSLP ) ) . 3 . To determine whether increased transcript expression type 2 cytokine-inducing profile corroborate increased expression protein . 4 . To determine whether RV infection asthma cohort associate increase biomarkers inflammation . 5 . To determine whether increased severity RV infection asthma AR cohort associate symptom . 6 . To determine whether increased severity RV infection asthma AR cohort relate decreased innate immunity .</detailed_description>
