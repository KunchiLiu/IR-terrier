	<detailed_description>The overall prevalence metabolic syndrome general US population estimate 22-34.5 % great prevalence certain population ( e.g . Mexican African Americans , woman ) . These number consistent rise prevalence obesity US population 34.9 % , remain stable last 10 year . Veterans particularly predispose metabolic syndrome since prevalence obesity much high among rank . Since annual medical cost obese metabolic syndrome $ 1429 high healthy weight , impact cost healthcare Veterans potentially tremendous . This mainly since obesity strongly associate many chronic disease , include type 2 diabetes , cardiovascular disease , type cancer ( endometrial , postmenopausal breast , kidney , colon ) , musculoskeletal disorder , sleep apnea , gallbladder disease . In order combat obesity epidemic Veterans , U.S. Department Veterans Affairs create MOVE ! Weight Management Program ( MOVE ! ) 2006 . MOVE ! evidence-based weight-management program design patient follow primary care clinic BMI ≥30kg/m2 BMI ≥25kg/m2 1 obesity-related condition ( e.g . diabetes , hypertension , dyslipidemia ) . The efficacy program measure % patient lose least 5 % body weight 8 week 6 month first session . In addition , TeleMOVE ! program recently initiate within VA system help individual make VA MOVE ! program due work schedule distance VA clinic . This observational study investigate potential clinical utility Pathway Fit® test investigate whether patient successfully lose weight ( define lose least 5 % body weight 8 week initiation ) MOVE ! TeleMOVE ! program distinct nutrigenetic profile unable lose significant amount weight . We use electronic record identify individual successfully complete MOVE ! program ( i.e . attend full 8 week course ) TeleMOVE ! program . In addition find age- gender- match individual attend complete MOVE ! Or TeleMOVE ! program lose weight . After completion MOVE ! Or TeleMOVE ! program Veterans submit saliva sample Pathway Fit® test . The start end weight participant record . The nutrigenic profile successful weight loss compare less successful determine cohort particular genetic profile . Also , blood collect storage study metabolomics . To encourage participation , participant reimburse participation study Pathway Fit® test result provide . Comparisons pertinent measure make achieve least 5 % weight loss . Upon completion study , clinical utility Pathway Fit® test investigate determine successful nutrigenic profile predict clinical outcome participant MOVE ! program lifestyle management program .</detailed_description>
