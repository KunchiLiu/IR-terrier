	<brief_summary>This study measure dynamic real-time IOP anterior chamber standard phacoemulsification surgery . What known : - Fluidics control determine one primary driver physician decision make choose phacoemulsification equipment . - Active pressure system fluidic control perceive possibly real ( base upon recent literature ) improvement intra-cameral IOP stability reduce pressure fluctuation . - Improved fluidics allow reduce dynamic IOP fluctuation , in-the-bag position phaco tip , intra-cameral fluid flow likely improve corneal health post-operatively .</brief_summary>
