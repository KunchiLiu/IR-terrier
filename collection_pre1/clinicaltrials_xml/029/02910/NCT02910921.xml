	<brief_summary>This trial collaboration Mayo Clinic , Second Opinion Health ( Simon Bloch , simon @ somobilehealth.com 408-981-3814 ) Allergan . Mayo Clinic investigator conduct clinical trial , Second Opinion Health provide software use trial ( Migraine Alert app data collection , analysis machine learn algorithm ) , Allergan provide funding . The investigator hypothesize use mobile phone app Fitbit wearable collect daily headache diary data , exposure/trigger data physiologic data predict occurrence migraine attack high accuracy . The objective trial ass ability use daily exposure/trigger symptom data , well physiologic data ( collected Fitbit ) create individual predictive migraine model accurately predict migraine attack individual patient via mobile phone app .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Individualized Prediction Migraine Attacks Using Mobile Phone App Fitbit</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eliminating migraine attack start enormous importance migraine sufferer . But figure onset attack actually start remains major challenge medical community . The widespread use mobile smartphones , availability wearable device measure health information , advance multivariate pattern analysis via machine learn algorithms allow development individual predictive model determine likelihood individual patient develop migraine give day . Such model base upon objectively measure biometric parameter ( e.g . activity , sleep ) , objectively measure environmental condition ( e.g . weather parameter ) , exposures possible migraine trigger , patient report symptom . Using machine-learning algorithm explore large dataset collect patient , optimal combination factor accurately predict likelihood migraine attack determine . Prediction individual migraine attack would substantial positive impact patient migraine . Accurate prediction migraine attack would give migraineur great sense control condition , sense control often lack patient migraine . Most importantly , individual migraine attack could predict high accuracy , treatment inevitable migraine attack development symptom could prevent attack altogether . Eligible subject enter baseline phase subject wear Fitbit device record data daily headache diary use mobile phone app . This phase variable duration subject maximum 75 day . It baseline phase individualize predictive model migraine attack develop optimize . During second phase ( 75 day ) , accuracy predictive model test . The probability develop migraine calculate accuracy prediction test patient report incidence migraine attack within mobile phone app . Subjects blind app 's migraine attack prediction avoid expectancy bias . Migraine prediction suffers 'the curse dimensionality ' ( machine learn parlance ) . Too many factor affect outcome , outcome ( positive migraine attack ) far . To develop accurate machine learn model use traditional approach require long impractical time duration . Migraine Alert effectively address use proprietary algorithm technique generate individual model use few migraine . Covariate analysis perform individual use feature derive raw data . Individual model may differ one specific feature use and/or importance attach model . Proprietary technique use create individual model monitor pre-validation post-validation accuracy recall . Concept drift evidence degradation accuracy recall monitor prediction phase model retrain necessary .</detailed_description>
