	<brief_summary>This study aim provide National Malaria Control Programs ( NMCP ) , international donor key stake holder clear evidence impact cost-effectiveness use indoor residual spraying ( IRS ) non-pyrethroid insecticide high transmission area universal long-lasting insecticidal net ( LLIN ) coverage . The district Mopeia , province Zambezia , Mozambique study site . This high transmission area malaria parasite prevalence 54 % child , The Ministry Health distribute LLINs Mopeia 2014-2015 . A simplified census take place mid-2016 determine number child five year age district , enumerate map household . From 115 villages/bairros existent Mopeia , 86 cluster select randomize either receive IRS Actellic accord President 's Malaria Initiative Africa Indoor Residual Spraying Project ( PMI-AIRS ) standard procedure ( 43 cluster ) IRS ( 43 cluster ) . From cluster , cohort 18 child five year age follow monthly ass malaria incidence community level two study arm . There 774 child IRS arm 774 child no-IRS arm ( total cohort 1548 ) . Additionally , routine health centre reporting system strengthen assess malaria incidence child five year age passive case detection . Two cross sectional study April 2017 April 2018 , assess change net use , health seek behaviour malaria prevalence community level . Entomological data collect IRS control area assess vector dynamic insecticide resistance pattern local vector population study arm . Data cost intervention well health-related expenditure health system household level collect prospectively throughout study . These cost determine use health system societal perspective . The incidence rate control intervention area combine micro-costing data calculate cost per case avert community health facility level .

	<detailed_description>Mopeia district Zambezia Province . Mopeia border district Morrumbala North , district Chinde province Sofala South , district Nicoadala Inhassunge East Provinces Sofala Tete West . It area 7671 km2 . The project population 2016 162.188 individual 31.927 ( 19.7 % ) five year age ( National Institute Statistics , Mozambique ) . There three administrative post , eleven locality 224 village ( Bairros ) approximately 34.603 household . There 12 health facility ( PMI-AIRS Mozambique , unpublished data ) . There little socio-economic data available Mopeia . The malaria burden high Zambezia parasite prevalence 54 % under-fives [ 19 ] . The parasite prevalence child 1-15 year age Mopeia 47.8 % ( 38.7 % -57.1 % ) [ 20 ] . The mean RDT positivity rate recent enhance surveillance exercise health facility 62.8 % ( range 50-72 % ) [ 21 ] . The data suggest high incidence health facility , show 470 case per 1000 child period ( June-Nov 2014 ) . Mopeia recently receive 175.297 LLINs 2013 IRS pyrethroids 2014 [ 22 ] . Residents Mopeia receive new LLINs early 2017 . Data February 2015 neighbour district Mocuba Morrumbala show Pyrethroid resistance local Anopheles gambiae s.l . population [ 23 ] . Further north , district Milange , test Anopheles gambiae s.l . remain susceptible pyrethroids [ 23 ] . See table 2 detail . Mopeia select present study high malaria transmission intensity , presence LLINs district , aforementioned regional indication reduce pyrethroid susceptibility target vector population , existence IRS infrastructure capacity previous campaign . The village select cluster receive IRS Actellic accord PMI-Africa IRS ( AIRS ) Project operate procedure [ 24 ] addition exist LLINs . Control cluster exist LLINs , receive IRS . In late 2017 ( year two ) , IRS repeat use cluster distribution insecticide . Additionally 2017 , whole district subject universal LLIN distribution . Adherence intervention confirm questionnaire monthly active cohort visit cross-sectional survey , include question wall replastering/painting net usage ( SSPs COST 001 , 002 003 ) . Additional information obtain cone bioassay . The standard malaria care community health center remain unchanged throughout study stock level malaria commodity ensure . This implementation study Mozambique provide detail information impact cost-effectiveness add IRS extend release formulation organophosphate insecticide pirimiphos-methyl ( ActellicÂ®300CS ) high transmission area high LLIN coverage . This information disseminate NMCP well local international stakeholder decision maker inform policy recommendation choice regard combination vector control strategy . A simplified census conduct June-July 2016 obtain total number child five year age per household village . This information use order randomly assign village intervention status determine cohort follow prospectively . The total population disaggregated five year age five village district use denominator passive case detection component study . Each house geopositioned census visit order ass cluster size household group order define cluster size , core buffer area . Each household receive unique permID . For cluster-randomized trial , villages/bairros enumerate , 86 cluster choose among available villages/bairros exclusion operationally difficult area matched/stratified . Villages leader refuse consent also exclude . The cluster stratify population size randomize 1:1 ratio receive IRS IRS . To determine incidence active case detection , cohort child five year age follow monthly core zone cluster . During visit care taker answer short questionnaire regard health , net usage health-related expenditure . The temperature recruit child record RDT perform . If child positive RDT , irrespective accompany clinical symptom he/she receive treatment accord national guideline . At health facility level , separate facility-based team ensure collection household location ( village ) malaria case determine incidence different study cluster passive case detection . Joint work community health worker ( Agentes Polivantes Elementares [ APEs ] ) also strengthen quality data , ask include information location ( village ) malaria case diagnose/treat . Costing data prospectively collect use standardize data collection tool determine cost intervention ( IRS LLIN distribution ) care-seeking . Cross-sectional study carry peak transmission season 2017 2018 . There potential monthly visit active case detection influence household behavior expenditure . Additional data house expenditure collect cross-sectionals assess societal cost malaria care independent study visit . Entomological data include mosquito density , sporozoite rate , resistance status indoor/outdoor bite ratio sample study arm throughout study follow standard PMI procedure .</detailed_description>
