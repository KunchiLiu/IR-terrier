	<brief_summary>Atopic dermatitis psoriasis two skin disease often associate bacterial infection inflammation . Studies indicate skin cell patient may change make patient susceptible bacterial infection . Inflammatory environment may effect function skin cell . The purpose study learn skin cell ( keratinocytes fibroblast ) regulate skin barrier function . To study need establish skin cell grown laboratory . We use small skin biopsy patient atopic dermatitis , psoriasis healthy people source cell . Since skin cell limit lifetime grown laboratory part project would like modify , allow grow long time research laboratory . Some collected skin biopsy isolate skin cell use examine gene product make .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Visit 1 ( need ) . Study subject ask read sign inform consent . At time study inclusion exclusion criterion study review . Subject give instruction stop take certain medication 7 day prior next study visit . Alternatively , Visit 1 do phone , subject may contact via phone use phone script provide instruction stop medication . In case , inform consent obtain subject visit 2 prior study procedure do . If subject take occasional Aspirin ( take daily ) , need withhold seven day prior visit 2 . If subject take oral antihistamine , need withhold seven day prior subject 's first appointment . If subject take oral antibiotic , inform subject appointment schedule seven day last dose antibiotic take . If subject take topical medication include ( restrict ) , cyclosporine , Elidel , Protopic , topical corticosteroid topical antibiotic , need withhold seven day prior subject 's first appointment . If subject take follow medication , eligible enrollment : Oral corticosteroid Any systemic immunosuppressive immunomodulary medication last 28 day . Patients receive immunotherapy past year . Patients use anxiolytic antidepressant Antiviral therapy Anticoagulants Allergic lidocaine Daily Aspirin Visit 2 : Will occur approximately 7 day follow screen visit phone call . If subject contact via phone , he/she review sign informed consent form visit . The following procedure perform . Urine Pregnancy Test : All female pregnant become pregnant study . The urine pregnancy test administer woman child bear potential . If test positive , participation study terminate . Skin Biopsies : The skin biopsy involve take small piece skin ( 4 biopsy 2mm diameter ) generally obtain arm leg , face exclude skin biopsy . The area clean numbed local anesthetic . Biopsies collect non-lesion skin acute lesion . The wound require stitch heal within two week . The biopsy site need kept sterile require area get wet . The skin biopsy perform one physician investigator nurse practitioner . The subject give name phone number nurse tell call problem . The subject give instruction care biopsy site . Venipuncture : 7.5 mL blood remove put needle vein . The procedure perform physician investigator nurse CTRC . The subject give name phone number nurse tell call problem . There follow-up venipuncture procedure . DNA testing : Additional 7.5 ml blood obtain genetic test filaggrin gene polymorphism ( perform ADx lab NJH ) . Skin culture : Skin rub cotton swab cell place special culture medium tube identification bacteria wabs test presence S. aureus culture PCR . Tape Stripping . Adhesive skin sample discs firmly press skin hairless location ( face ) follow lift free skin . Skin tape collect non-lesion skin acute skin lesion . This repeat 40 time . These disc use evaluate RNA , lipids protein upper layer skin . With every 5 tape strip collect one lesion one non-lesion area skin barrier assessment preform . Skin Barrier Assessment . Skin serve first barrier allergen , virus , bacteria may aggravate skin disease . A small device use measure quantity water pass inside body skin surround atmosphere via diffusion evaporation process . Additionally , device measure skin pH , also associate change skin barrier . Sweat Test . We measure chemical patient ' sweat , salt , know sweat test . To collect sweat , sticky pad attach skin patient ' arm 5 minute . A gel contain medicine call pilocarpine put pad cause sweat gland produce sweat . The pad remove replaced disc collect sweat 30 minute . Sebum Collection . Skin surface clean alcohol wipe . After allow skin surface dry sebum collect tape apply skin surface . The tape hold skin surface one hour . The tape use evaluate skin sebum production . Optional Visits : The research team may ask subject return every 6 week participate additional skin biopsy , tape strip blood draw ( exceed 6.5 tablespoon ( 100 ml ) ) . The subject may choose participate optional visit exceed 6 additional blood draw , tape strip and/or biopsy one year .</detailed_description>
