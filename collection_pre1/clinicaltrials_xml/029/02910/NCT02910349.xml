	<detailed_description>Introduction : Chronic aortic regurgitation common valvular heart disease prevalence approximately 1 % European population ; affect rather young patient . The common cause chronic aortic regurgitation develop country calcific aortic valve disease bicuspid aortic valve . Another relatively frequent cause chronic aortic regurgitation aortic root dilation , genetically determine also frequently diagnose young patient . According current guideline valvular heart disease , surgical treatment recommend patient severe symptomatic aortic regurgitation patient severe asymptomatic aortic regurgitation leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LV EF ) &lt; 50 % cardiothoracic surgery plan ( Class I ) . Current guideline also recommend consider surgical strategy ( Class IIa ) asymptomatic patient severe aortic regurgitation , leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LV EF ) ≥ 50 % leave ventricular end-systolic diameter &gt; 50 mm indexed diameter &gt; 25 mm/m2 . There two reason consider earlier surgical treatment . Surgical technique perioperative treatment improve recently postoperative patient outcome significantly well . There also strong evidence leave ventricular ( LV ) diameter decrease shortly surgery leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LV EF ) remain unchanged majority patient leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LV EF ) one main determinant patient 's future quality life life expectancy . However , surgical correction might indicate late clinical practice , typically woman . The Mayo Clinic author group report woman exhibit excess late mortality compare male population . They show woman severely symptomatic time surgery compare male population leave ventricular ( LV ) enlargement frequent . Bonow al report 33 % incidence clinical event , death deterioration leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LV EF ) , natural history asymptomatic patient severe aortic regurgitation preserve leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LV EF ) . The optimal timing surgical treatment crucial clearly establish yet . New method identify subclinical leave ventricular ( LV ) function impairment need well time surgical strategy . Clinical follow-up routine echocardiography study recommend every 6 to12 month patient severe asymptomatic aortic regurgitation sudden deterioration leave ventricular ( LV ) function might occur aim operate patient happen . It clear parameter need leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LV EF ) leave ventricular ( LV ) size . Diffuse myocardial fibrosis common feature pathophysiology chronic leave ventricular ( LV ) overload . Left ventricular ejection fraction ( LV EF ) leave ventricular ( LV ) size less sensitive non-specific marker process . Fortunately several novel method non-invasive quantification diffuse myocardial fibrosis introduce recently . The promising method magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) - derive T1 relaxation time mapping introduce Messroghli 2004 , Modified Look-Locker inversion recovery ( MOLLI ) sequence . Based publish data , MRI derive native T1 relaxation time reliable marker diffuse myocardial fibrosis . The native T1 relaxation time cut value ≥ 1010 m accurate marker extensive ( &gt; 30 % ) myocardial fibrosis high sensitivity specificity ( Ss=90 % , Sp=73 % , area curve ( AUC ) =0.82 ) . Extracellular myocardial volume ( ECV ) calculate MOLLI sequence also sensitive marker diffuse myocardial fibrosis extracellular myocardial volume ( ECV ) cutoff value ≥ 0.315 show high accuracy identify extensive ( &gt; 30 % ) myocardial collagen content ( Ss=80 % , Sp=90 % , AUC =0.85 ) . Speckle track echocardiography another promise imaging method diffuse myocardial fibrosis . Two-dimensional LV global longitudinal strain ( GLS ) potential discover subclinical leave ventricular ( LV ) functional impairment Project Plan : 1 . All patient scan MRI include Modified Look-Locker inversion recovery ( MOLLI ) within one week inclusion complete anonymized study send CoreLab IKEM . Off-line analysis consist leave right ventricle volumetric ejection fraction assessment . The aortic regurgitation measure use method flow sequence sinotubular junction level ( phantom correction require ) ventricular stroke volume difference . Modified Look-Locker inversion recovery ( MOLLI ) sequence acquire , 10 15 minute contrast agent administration . T1 relaxation time measure within interventricular septum ECV calculate T1 relaxation time myocardium blood pool . Off-line analysis perform two independent operator blind clinical ECHO finding intra- inter-observer variability calculate . 2 . All patient undergo 2-D 3-D transthoracic echocardiography within one week inclusion every six month follow-up participate centre . All full volume anonymized study send CoreLab IKEM . Off-line analysis leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LV EF ) , leave ventricular ( LV ) volume , leave ventricular ( LV ) mass , speckle tracking leave ventricular ( LV ) global longitudinal strain ( GLS ) , radial strain leave ventricular ( LV ) twist perform two independent operator blind fashion . Similarly aortic regurgitation grade assess two operator use colour Doppler , vena contracta measurement , Doppler flow measurement . Inter- intra-observer variability calculate . 3 . In patient 12-lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) record blood sample take visit . Brain natriuretic peptide serum level measure routinely participate centre . One blood sample store frozen -80 C° analysis include example galectin level , etc . This specific analysis perform 1.Faculty Medicine Charles University Prague supervision Prof. Sedmera . 4 . Sub-study . 1 . All patient schedule aortic valve surgery follow-up ( strictly accord current guideline ) undergo perioperative myocardial needle biopsy interventricular septum participate centre . All myocardial sample process analysed 1.Faculty Medicine Charles University Prague supervision Prof. Sedmera . 2 . All patient schedule aortic valve surgery follow-up undergo repeat magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) study include Modified Look-Locker inversion recovery ( MOLLI ) sequence within 1-3 month prior operation 6-12 month operation . The complete study repeat described . Postoperative leave ventricular ( LV ) remodelling precisely assess off-line analysis . A correlation leave ventricular ( LV ) remodelling preoperative regurgitation grade assess magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) echocardiography ( ECHO ) calculate . Postoperative leave ventricular ( LV ) remodelling also correlate preoperative T1 myocardial relaxation time , extracellular volume ( ECV ) global longitudinal strain ( GLS ) . Project Hypothesis : 1 . We hypothesize increased native T1 longitudinal relaxation time assess T1 mapping ( Modified Look-Locker inversion recovery sequence ) &gt; 1010 m decrease global longitudinal strain ( GLS ) &lt; 17 % novel potent prognostic marker clinical deterioration patient moderate severe severe chronic asymptomatic aortic regurgitation despite preserved leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LV EF ) . 2 . We hypothesize inter- intra-observer variability aortic regurgitation severity assessment lower magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) study echocardiography ( ECHO ) study . 3 . We hypothesize degree postoperative leave ventricular ( LV ) recovery ( decrease leave ventricular ( LV ) volume leave ventricular ( LV ) mass ) correlate well preoperative magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) regurgitation grade assessment rather echocardiography ( ECHO ) derive grade .
