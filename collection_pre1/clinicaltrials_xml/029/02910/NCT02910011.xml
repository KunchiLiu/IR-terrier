	<brief_summary>This study investigate safety clinical efficacy novel doxycycline topical formulation subject Atopic Dermatitis ( AD ) . The investigator hypothesize daily application study drug AD subject reduce severity disease , reduce skin drive inflammation restore skin barrier function . The investigator also monitor anti-microbial activity product AD skin , colonization Staph aureus typically associated disease severity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Atopic Dermatitis ( AD ) common inflammatory skin disease , affect 17 % child 6 % adult USA , . AD characterize skin barrier disruption , aberrant adaptive immune response ( i.e. , Th2 polarize ) environmental allergen , susceptibility cutaneous bacterial infection intractable itch , . The intense pruritus cutaneous infection contribute morbidity AD major driver reduce quality-of-life associated disease , . In World Health Organization 2010 Global Burden Disease survey , AD rank first among common skin disease . So far , AD treatment target inflammation widespread use topical intermittent use systemic corticosteroid . In summary , despite high prevalence , effect quality-of-life economic burden - effective treatment AD . Doxycycline tetracycline antibiotic broadly use systemically treat inflammatory-dermatologic condition . Several study human animal model show doxycycline anti-inflammatory pro-healing property , mainly block tissue proteolytic activity . Doxycycline report nonselectively inhibit member metalloproteinases ( MMP ) superfamily [ review , ] . In addition direct inhibitory activity , doxycycline indirectly prevent tryptic kallikreins activation MMPs . Growing body evidence suggest tetracycline might also directly downregulate Protease Activator receptor ( PAR ) -2 expression function , also find play role induction local inflammatory mediator . Importantly , doxycycline antimicrobial activity could lead reduce Staphylococcus infection/colonization AD skin , know trigger AD flare</detailed_description>

Active Atopic Dermatitis : Subjects must within last 3 month accord medical record , patient account medical exam investigator : Pruritus Eczema ( acute , subacute , chronic ) Chronic relapse history Most subject ( see case , add support diagnosis ) : Early age onset Atopy Personal and/or family history Xerosis Subjects may ( clinical association help suggest diagnosis AD nonspecific define detect AD research epidemiological study ) : 1 . Atypical vascular response ( e.g. , facial pallor , white dermographism , delay blanch response ) 2 . Keratosis pilaris/hyperlinear palms/ichthyosis 3 . Ocular/periorbital change 4 . Other regional finding ( e.g. , perioral changes/periauricular lesion ) 5 . Perifollicular accentuation/lichenification/prurigo lesion Moderate Severe AD : clinical score base Eczema Area Severity Score ( EASI ) ≥ 10 If receive antihistamine , stabilize dose , expect maintain dose throughout study All female subject childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test screen visit must acceptable method contraception Screening Visit continuously 30 day stop study drug . As determined study doctor , medical history may interfere study objective ( cancer , chronic illness ) Known allergy tetracycline Subjects systemic infection require course systemic antibiotic antiviral within last 2 week Unstable AD consistent requirement systemic immunemodulant Rx ( e.g . systemic steroid , phototherapy , Cyclosporine ) History use biologic therapy ( include intravenous immunoglobulin ) Recent anticipate concomitant use systemic therapy might alter course AD Recent current participation another research study Females breastfeeding , pregnant , plan get pregnant participation study Subjects history keloid formation History lidocaine , epinephrine Novocain allergy History allergy tape adhesive material</criteria>
