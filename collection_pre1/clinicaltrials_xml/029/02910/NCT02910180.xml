	<detailed_description>Genetic metabolic profile become important mean evaluate various pathology , effect patient , treatment . In regard cerebrovascular disease stroke , number hypothesis propose . The level type various angiogenic factor blood tissue propose predictive patient outcome ischemic stroke treatment stroke . Likewise , genetic factor may predict outcome response various type treatment . The role biological sample further understanding cerebrovascular disease treatment well document . Muscle microdialysis sample confirm presence sublethal ischemia induction remote ischemic preconditioning . The effect remote ischemic preconditioning coagulation profile , DNA methylation , cell cycle gene expression patient aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage also elucidate . Blood sample collect patient intracranial arterial stenosis produce many insight . Inflammatory cell profile patient receive encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis ( EDAS ) surgery characterize . Angiogenic factor measurement show predict degree neovascularization patient post-EDAS . In patient intracranial atherosclerosis , angiogenic factor profile find strongly correlate failure medical management poor outcome . It clear genetic metabolic profile effective tool evaluate effect cerebrovascular disease treatment . This study encompass maintenance utilization repository sample patient cerebrovascular disease stroke . For every patient enrol study , relevant patient information age , gender , diagnosis , medical history , family history , procedures/treatments receive , radiological report , patient outcomes record . This information update upon every follow-up study . The type tissue take blood , cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) , tissue , microdialysis sample . Future analysis sample potentially help investigator well categorize group patient , understand underlie etiology pathology , identify marker associate favorable poor outcome , track change occur natural course disease treatment . This repository serve groundwork explore question future .</detailed_description>
