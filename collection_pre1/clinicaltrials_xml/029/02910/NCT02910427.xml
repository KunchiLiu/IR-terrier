	<brief_summary>Cerebrovascular disease second lead cause death Taiwan . Although stroke incidence mortality decline steadily Taiwan , impact medical cost , quality life neurological deficit remain extraordinary . Stroke incidence mortality also rise develop country presumably due world-wide increase prevalence obesity metabolic syndrome . Negative association observe high blood pressure , hyperglycemia two major dietary cation vegetable dairy product : potassium magnesium . Mean level dietary potassium magnesium intake Taiwan much low dietary reference intake . Short term supplementation study demonstrate effect reduce blood pressure degree insulin resistance . However , long-term study cardiovascular event lack . Our previous long-term intervention trial elderly veteran home show 41 % reduction cardiovascular mortality simply switch regular cooking salt potassium-enriched salt kitchen . The investigator previously observe annual reduction medical cost around $ 15,000 NT aforementioned veteran home trial . A multi-centered randomized control trial carry three arm : ( 1 ) regular salt ( Na salt ) , ( 2 ) potassium-enriched salt ( K salt ) , ( 3 ) potassium magnesium-enriched salt ( K/Mg salt ) . The objective study investigate whether potassium magnesium-enriched salt would improve neurological performance stroke patients.The investigator anticipate observe beneficial effect consume potassium magnesium enrich salt neurological improvement stroke patient .</brief_summary>
