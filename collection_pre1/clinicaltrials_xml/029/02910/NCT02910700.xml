	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn nivolumab trametinib ( without dabrafenib ) help control metastatic melanoma patient BRAF , NRAS , BRAF-wild-type mutation . The safety drug combination also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Anti-PD-1 Antibody Nivolumab Combination With Dabrafenib and/or Trametinib Patients With BRAF NRAS-mutated Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign 1 2 study group base type mutation . - If Group A , receive nivolumab , dabrafenib , trametinib ( BRAF-mutated patient ) . - If Group B , receive nivolumab trametinib ( BRAF-wild-type NRAS-mutation patient ) . You study staff know group assign . Study Drug Administration : Each study cycle 4 week . All participant receive nivolumab vein 30 minute Days 1 15 cycle . If Group A , take dabrafenib capsule 2 time day trametinib tablet 1 time every day . Dabrafenib trametinib take time morning , second dose dabrafenib take 12 hour first dose . You take dabrafenib trametinib cup water ( 8 ounce ) every time , either 1 hour 2 hour meal . If Group B , take trametinib tablet mouth every day study . Each dose take 1 time every day morning time cup water ( 8 ounce ) , either 1 hour 2 hour meal . If vomit dose study drug , retake dose . Wait next schedule dose . If Group A miss dose dabrafenib , may take dose soon remember , long next dose 6 hour later . If miss dose trametinib , may take dose soon remember long next dose schedule least 12 hour later . Length Study : You may continue take study drug 3 year You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction , study doctor think interest . Your participation study 3 year follow-up ( describe ) . Study Visits : During Week 1 Cycle 1 : - You physical exam , include skin exam . - Blood ( 5 teaspoon ) draw routine test check autoimmune status . During Weeks 2 4 Cycles 1-3 Week 3 Cycle 3 , blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . During Week 3 Cycle 1 : - You physical exam , include skin exam . - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine , PD , PBMC test . During Week 1 Cycle 2 : - You physical exam , include skin exam . - You EKG . - You eye exam . - Blood ( 5 teaspoon ) draw routine test - If become pregnant , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) urine collect pregnancy test . During Week 3 Cycle 2 : - You physical exam , include skin exam . - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . During Week 1 Cycles 3 beyond : - You physical exam , include skin exam . - You EKG . - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . During Cycle 3 , blood sample also use PD PBMC test . - If become pregnant , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) urine collect pregnancy test . During Week 3 Cycle 3 beyond , blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . At Months 3 , 6 , 12 , stop take stuy drug Month 12 , eye exam . Additional eye exam perform study doctor think need . Every 12 week : - You MRI and/or CT scan . - You ECHO . End-of-Treatment Visit : About 30 day last dose study drug : - You physical exam . - You EKG . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine , PD , PBMC test . - You MRI and/or CT scan . - If study doctor think need , eye exam . Long-Term Follow-Up : After stop taking study drug , study doctor study staff continue check health every 3 month 3 year . This information may collect routine , standard care clinic visit ; may collect medical record ; may call study staff ask . If call , take 10 minute . Your participation complete long-term follow-up . This investigational study . Nivolumab , trametinib , dabrafenib FDA approve commercially available treatment melanoma . However , consider investigational use drug combination treat melanoma . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 60 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
