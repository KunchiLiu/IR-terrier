	<brief_summary>Elderly ( i.e. &gt; 75 yr ) represent 40 % incident dialysis patient French REIN Registry grow population high income country . Those elderly patient CKD high risk die within first month dialysis start could good long-term prognosis suggest kidney transplantation access . Elderly patient CKD also high risk die reach ESRD . Therefore , outcomes elderly patient advance CKD need well describe understood able give accurate information patient relatives help decision make concern treatment strategy include several option ( i.e preemptive kidney transplantation , center home dialysis conservative care ) . In France information patient start dialysis French dialysis registry ( REIN ) elderly patient treat conservative care . Then n't information description therapeutic project population evolution prospective cohort design . Finally need identify patient high risk early mortality help share decision make good care organisation . The project study development French multicenter prospective cohort include elderly patient 75 year old reach ESRD . Objectives follow : Description characteristic population , clinical social condition , medicine treatment , therapeutic project declare nephrologist laboratory value inclusion . Description evolution therapeuic project , kidney function outcome define death dialysis kidney transplantation . Development mortality prognosis tool help decision make population .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>At inclusion patient data collect demographic clinical condition ( comorbidities disability ) , mobility ( walk without help , need assistance totally dependent transfer ) , way living ( home living institutionalize ) , biological data ( blood urine ) , therapeutic project option dialysis medical reason start dialysis . As observational study current practice , additional test additional visit mandatory either inclusion follow-up . Data dialysis start outcomes extract French National ESRD registry REIN . This linkage approve French Advisory Committee Information Processing Material Research Field Health ( CCTIRS ) , National Commission Information Technology Privacy ( Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et de Libertes ) ethic committee . The start dialysis condition include patient 's clinical characteristic , use central vascular catheter ( CVC ) , unplanned condition dialysis start first modality dialysis ( peritoneal hemodialysis ) . After dialysis start , patient survival information dialysis withdrawal death collect . The number patient include fix 500 study least 15 prognosis factor estimation 30 % death follow-up .</detailed_description>
