	<brief_title>Frailty INstrument Evaluation Elderly Patients With Non ST ElevationMyocardial Infarction ( NSTEMI ) - 5 Year Follow</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The term frailty denote multi-dimensional syndrome characterize increased vulnerability decrease physiologic reserve . Frailty stratification predict patient 's risk death need institutional care . The construct well validate , one single accept operational definition . The CSHA Clinical Frailty Scale ( CFS ) 7-point scale rely clinical judgement . It global clinical measure biological age , mixes co-morbidity , disability cognitive impairment.Though frailty instrument far mainly use geriatric context , point relevant cardiologic patient well , e.g . regard risk stratification elderly patient NSTEMI . In FINE 75+ study , 307 Non ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction ( NSTEMI ) patient , 75 year old old , include September 2009 June 2010 . We report importance frailty short-term ( 1 month ) medium-term outcome ( 1 year ) NSTEMI population ( Ekerstad et al . 2011 , Ekerstad et al . 2013 ) . However , publish data importance frailty longer-term outcome . Information long-term prognosis may substantially improve informed decision make elderly patient NSTEMI , acute potentially harmful treatment aim improved long-term prognosis . The purpose study describe patient , 75 year old old , NSTEMI especially regard follow variable : cardiovascular risk , co-morbidity frailty , assess prognostic value frailty 5-year outcomes.For purpose current analysis patient include final FINE 75+ study follow 5 year hospital admission . We hypothesize frailty independently associate 5-year mortality .</detailed_description>
