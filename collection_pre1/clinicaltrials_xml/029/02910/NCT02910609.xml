	<brief_title>International Experience Timing And Choices Ductal Closure Patent Ductus Arteriosus : INTERPDA Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patent ductus arteriosus ( PDA ) , incidence inversely related gestational age birth weight , one common condition among preterm infant . In recent year , use antenatal steroid , postnatal surfactant , noninvasive ventilation strategy low oxygen saturation target affect incidence hemodynamically significant PDA ( HSPDA ) . There consensus best approach clinical management PDA preterm infant . Over past year , management HSPDA shift aggressive medical surgical intervention conservative treatment , conservative treatment approach mainly concerned nowadays . Today , three option treatment PDA preterm infant conservative approach , pharmacological intervention surgical ligation . There randomized-controlled trial demonstrate superiority approach preterm infant . Many country include developed country give recommendation , instead publish guideline , screen , time treatment treatment choice PDA , differences management PDA center even within single center . Timing PDA treatment treatment choice preterm infant born 28 gestation week ' differ country also many country world . In study , aim record management PDA detect beyond postnatal 3 day , compare effect management postnatal 3-7 day 7 day closure , surgical ligation rate side effect drug .</detailed_description>
