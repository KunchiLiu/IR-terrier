	<brief_summary>This open-label , dose escalation Phase I study evaluate tolerability efficacy single agent Nivolumab maintenance treatment prevent relapse patient hematologic malignancy allogeneic stem cell transplantation . Approximately 29 patient enrol , 6-12 patient include dose escalation phase 20 patient expansion cohort maximal tolerate dose .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Study Assess Tolerability Efficacy Nivolumab Patients With Hematologic Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nivolumab administrate intravenously . Standard dose escalation use intensification phase start dose 1m/kg every 2 week 4 dos . The DLT observation period 29 day start first dose take Day 1 , The study treatment continue one discontinuation criterion meet . Each dose level ( 1-2 ) test use 3+3 design . If level 2 3mg/kg reach without DLTs , 3mg/kg use dose expansion cohort . After intensification phase , patient start Nivolumab every 12 week maintenance phase till 2 year post allo-SCT . Patients also receive best supportive care ( BSC ) , include blood product transfusion , antimicrobial , ( appropriate ) granulocyte colony stimulate factor neutropenic infection poor graft function .</detailed_description>

Age ≥18 year . Because dose adverse event data currently available use nivolumab patient &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study , eligible future pediatric trial .

For reason , woman childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . WOCBP use adequate method avoid pregnancy 23 week ) last dose investigational drug Nivolumab . Women childbearing potential must negative serum urine pregnancy test ( minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L equivalent unit HCG ) within 24 hour prior start nivolumab . Women must breastfeed .
