	<detailed_description>Dry eye disease ( DED ) define multifactorial disease tear ocular surface result symptoms discomfort , visual disturbance , tear film instability potential damage ocular surface . It accompany increase osmolarity tear film inflammation ocular surface1 . An estimated 25 million Americans report dry eye disease ( DED ) 2 , number increase U.S. age population3 . The treatment currently available U.S. target inflammation ocular surface . Because dry eye complicate disease encompasses many condition eye , diversified way treat disease necessary . Some recent study suggest Dry Eye symptom cause corneal cold thermoreceptor ( TRPM8 ) chronically fire below-normal threshold . It thus logically follow dry eye patient could distinguish normal patient possess high symptom response secondary topical application menthol , potent agonist TRPM8 . If dry eye patient indeed low threshold firing TRPM8 , agonize TRPM8 menthol elicit severe symptom response , give equal concentration across population . To fully elucidate relationship TRPM8 agonist , sensation , tear film cooling , two dry eye population test - one population exhibit symptom response previous dry eye agent , one population symptom response agent .</detailed_description>
