	<brief_summary>Clinical risk assessment management mostly relevant emergency . Thoracic ultrasound ( TUS ) propose easy-option replacement chest X-ray ( CXR ) Emergency diagnosis pneumonia , pleural effusion pneumothorax . Investigators investigate CXR `` unforeseen diagnosis '' , provide TUS , explore usefulness sustainability telementoring aim management clinical risk . This observational report include period six month proactive concurrent adjunctive telementoring TUS diagnosis use freely available smartphone application transfer image movie .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Emergency Thoracic Ultrasound Clinical Risk Management</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The present study describe six month period specialist activity Emergency Department physician . The aim display performance subset difficult unexpected thoracic ultrasound image perform TUS , context prompt availability radiological facility . The interaction TUS telementoring , use WhatsApp® Skype® , provide another colleague , another city hospital , great specific expertise TUS , devise assure concurrent mentorship School . This training include subsequent revaluation clinical case Ultrasound Course Lecturer TUS Director School Clinical Ultrasound , reappraisal overview available information . The approach clinical instrumental , include : A. clinical history ; B. clinical examination chest , neck , joint abdomen ; C. sequential ultrasound examination abdomen , thorax , pericardium ; D. focus pain symptom : chest , abdomen ( without distention ) , lumbar region , neck ; E. focus dyspnea and/or cough and/or fever detection humid dry lung sound , chest dullness , heart and/or pleura-pericardial sound , and/or jugular congestion , check also mobility diaphragm evaluate collapsibility cava vein . TUS generally conduct patient sit position , although patient ( predominantly child ) , likely experience severe discomfort procedure , scan semi-supine position . A systematic examination intercostal space perform TUS image , present , assessed number , location , shape , size , breath-dependent change consolidation area . Two main type pattern lung consolidation attributable pneumonia define : hypoechoic consolidation mixed consolidation . The presence air bronchogram , fluid bronchogram , basal pleural effusion also report . The size consolidation area measure longitudinally transversally , use long measurement , i.e. , maximal length consolidation area visible TUS , data analysis . For purpose report , detail measurement detail . The second opinion provide outside Hospital facility mentor ( FMT ) , expert Clinical Ultrasound , answer question related image videoclips actual patient emergency . Images movie send WhatsApp . Reappraisal perform subsequently , use available image - photo videoclips , clinical record outcome information , obtainable short-term follow-up .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients include study satisfy one two criterion unexpected diagnosis TUS examination : 1 . Patients chest radiography diagnostic , totally negative , thoracic ultrasound suggest evidence specific pathology ( consolidation , effusion , pneumothorax ) , later confirm CT. 2 . Patients detection chest disease chest radiograph , specific condition detail , differently address ultrasound procedure , confirm CT. patient noninvasive pulse oximetry lower 92.0 % Peripheral oxygen saturation ( SpO2 ) , clinical instrumental sign heart failure , hemodialysis severe renal insufficiency , know diagnosis solid blood tumor .</criteria>
