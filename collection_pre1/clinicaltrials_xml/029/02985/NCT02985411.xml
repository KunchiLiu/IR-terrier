In survey 184 MGs AL , investigator find 71 % `` extremely interested '' mentor cancer survivor vegetable gardening subject CS , extra 26 % state `` interested want learn . '' Thus , project great interest build extant infrastructure sustainability . Ultimately , intervention could disseminate state 3 grow season adapt colder weather 2 grow season ( 36 state 10.8 million old cancer survivor reside ) . The intervention also could adapt person chronic disease physical functioning lifestyle behavior key . Finally , project significant intervention great potential sustainability since gardening : ( ) involve many activity prevent burn-out common form exercise , allow participant pursue PA outdoors relate great enjoyment ; ( b ) provide sense achievement zest life come nurture observe new life growth ; ( c ) impart natural prompt since plant require regular care ( water ) attention ( harvest ) serve continual dynamic behavioral cue .</detailed_description>
