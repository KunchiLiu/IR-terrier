	<detailed_description>Introduction Colonoscopy outcome strictly relate adenoma detection rate . An endoscopy withdrawal time &gt; 6min suggested increase adenoma detection rate since allows accurate evaluation several hidden area colon . The FUSE endoscope demonstrate also reduce rate miss lesion due wide angle view . Aim study evaluate impact adenoma detection rate either use FUSE endoscope intervention direct optimize withdrawal time . assess impact different factor influence withdrawal time Methods A prospective non-randomized observational single-center study involve consecutive outpatient , age 18-85 yr , undergo colonoscopy different indication . Previous abdominal colon resection , obstruction , inadequate preparation incomplete examination exclusion criterion . In 3-month period 4 expert endoscopists perform 500 colonoscopy either standard endoscope FUSE without dedicate withdrawal time protocol . Colonoscopy withdrawal time measure without endoscopists ' knowledge monitor . During subsequent 3-month period endoscopists perform 500 colonoscopy standard FUSE scopes use dedicate inspection technique minimum 6-minute withdrawal time . In second phase withdrawal time measure , endoscopists aware monitor . The following parameter record : - Demographic general characteristic - Indications colonoscopy - Colonoscopy finding - Quality preparation : Boston scale - Time reach coecum - Withdrawal time The adenoma detection rate mean adenoma per patient calculate .</detailed_description>
