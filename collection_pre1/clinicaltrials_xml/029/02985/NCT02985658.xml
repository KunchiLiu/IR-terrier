	<brief_summary>This expand access protocol allow continue maintenance therapy ABT-888 ( veliparib ) three patient metastatic triple negative breast cancer currently receive investigational product association clinical trial participation . Additionally , protocol enroll 7 new patient metastatic BRCA associate triple negative breast cancer allow additional access veliparib monotherapy , investigator 's discretion , veliparib combination cisplatin and/or vinorelbine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Expanded Access With ABT-888 ( Veliparib ) Treat Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ABT-888 ( Veliparib ) Poly ( ADP-ribose ) -polymerase ( PARP ) nuclear enzyme recognize deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) damage facilitate DNA repair . Inactive PARPs 1 2 bind damage DNA , lead auto-activation . The result activated PARP poly ( ADP-ribosyl ) ates many nuclear target protein , include facilitate DNA repair single-stranded double-stranded DNA break . Thus , PARP inhibition result less efficient DNA repair follow DNA damage insult . Since cancer cell genetically unstable , often exhibit complex karyotype include large deletion , insertion , unbalanced translocation chromosomal fragment , cell susceptible normal tissue cytotoxicity induce DNA-damaging agents.Of , deficiency mismatch repair homologous recombination associate large number malignancy , include many sporadic TNBCs . These deficiency render cell dependent PARP DNA repair , hence , prone cytotoxicity induce PARP inhibition . In particular , tumor cell BRCA1 BRCA2 deficiencies exquisitely sensitive PARP inhibition , even absence insult . Identification sporadic TNBC defect homologous recombination mismatch repair independent germline mutation BRCA 1 2 active area research interest . PARP-enabled DNA repair may also compensate loss repair pathway . Higher expression PARP cancer cell compare normal cell link drug resistance overall ability cancer cell sustain genotoxic stress . The combination platinum base chemotherapy PARP inhibition may effective TNBC , particularly subset TNBC . This combination may also active tumor germline BRCA1-deficiency and/or basal phenotype , since defect DNA double-strand break repair pathway increase sensitivity agent . The addition PARP inhibitor platinum base chemotherapy may induce `` double hit '' tumor cell lack homologous recombination without cause excess toxicity normal cell . ABT-888 may use combination DNA damaging agent , cisplatin , potentiate cytotoxic effect vinorelbine enhance tumor response rate . Safety preliminary efficacy veliparib combination cisplatin vinorelbine patient advanced triple negative BRCA-associated breast cancer report .</detailed_description>
