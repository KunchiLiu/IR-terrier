	<brief_summary>Background : Asthma COPD consider different disease many patient share characteristic entity . This term `` COPD-asthma overlap syndrome '' . Study objective : To examine : ( ) frequency overlap phenotype among patient refer pulmonary function testing , ( b ) impact phenotype therapeutic management quality life patient compare patient COPD asthma . Methods : Type study : Observational , cross-sectional . Study subject : Patients refer pulmonary function test diagnose airway obstruction ( FEV1/FVC &lt; 0.7 ) willing sign inform consent . Study procedure : Spirometry perform administration bronchodilator . Respiratory questionnaire : Questionnaires smoke habit , past history asthma wheezing , current medication history exacerbation administer inclusion . Questionnaire medication utilization administer telephone one month inclusion . Quality life : Will assess use Saint George Respiratory Questionnaire ( SGRQ ) . Working definition : The following definition adopt : ) COPD : smoking history &gt; 10 pack/years post-bronchodilator ( BD ) FEV1/FVC ratio &lt; 0.70 ; b ) Asthma : ( 1 ) presence wheeze last year plus minimum post-BD increase FEV1 FVC 12 % 200 ml ; ( 2 ) prior physician diagnosis ( age 40 ) ; c ) COPD-Asthma ( overlap group ) - combination two .

Outcome measure : The clinical outcome prevalence rate phenotype . Patient-reported outcome include utilization medication , number exacerbation , quality life . Statistical plan : Sample size : For estimate prevalence rate 20 % , 246 patient recruit 5 % imprecision 95 % degree confidence . To round , 250 patient include . Statistical method : Multiple comparison carry use one-way ANOVA continuous variable chi-squared test ( Fisher Exact Test ) qualitative variable . Multiple logistic regression model test examine relation `` COPD-asthma overlap '' phenotype various independent predictor variable . Expected benefit : Data collect could serve advance medical community 's knowledge pertain COPD-asthma overlap syndrome . Most importantly , however , encourage reflection best therapeutic option patient overlap syndrome . Indeed , recommendation matter noticeably absent current guideline propose treat monitor obstructive lung disease .</detailed_description>
