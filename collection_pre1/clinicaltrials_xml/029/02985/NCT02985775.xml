	<brief_summary>Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) infection remain important cause morbidity mortality allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant ( HSCT ) recipient , especially patient receive haploidentical transplantation . During past decade , prophylactic preemptive treatment antiviral drug significantly reduce incidence early-onset CMV infection . Unfortunately , prolonged antiviral treatment associate substantial toxicity may delay recovery virus specific immune response , result increase late-onset CMV disease . To date , adoptive immunotherapy develop treatment alternative antiviral agent CMV infection HSCT . Studies demonstrate prophylactic preemptive therapy donor CMV-specific T cell restore antiviral immunity clear CMV viremia transplantation . In prospective clinical phase I/II trial , propose reconstitute antiviral immunity CMV preemptive transfer CMVpp65-specific T cell ( CMV-CTLs ) early time point allogeneic stem cell transplantation . We also propose demonstrate whether protect CMV associate recovery CMV-CTLs .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>ALL patient enrol clinical trial standard risk patient diagnose acute leukemia myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) receive haploidentical blood marrow transplantation . When patient develop acute graft versus host disease ( aGVHD ) , CMVpp65-specific T cell generate transferred aGVHD control patient ( patient develop aGVHD low risk refractory CMV infection , include treat group ) . Physical exams blood test perform -2w , -0d +1d , +2w , +4w , +8w , +12w , +24w adoptive CMV-CTL transfusion . The end point safety clinical immunologic response . Following time 12 month .</detailed_description>
