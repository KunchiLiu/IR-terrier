	<brief_title>PK Study EXPAREL Subjects Undergoing Open Spinal Fusion Reconstructive Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 1 , multi-center , open-label study design evaluate safety pharmacokinetics EXPAREL administer via local wound infiltration subject undergo open cervical thoracic spinal fusion reconstructive surgery . Fifteen subject plan enrollment . Eligible subject , whose surgical incision must least 8 cm length , receive single dose EXPAREL ( 266 mg/20 mL ) expand volume 20-60 mL normal saline , depend size incision . Incision perform use posterior surgical approach . Administration Technique : Study drug inject prescribed location base area high nerve density . Study drug administer use syrinx 22-gauge needle prior wound closure . The Investigator must document size incision . Each infiltration site space 1.0-1.5 cm apart deliver approximately 1-1.5 mL deep superficial area ( para-spinous fascia , muscle , subcutaneous layer ) . As incision three layer infiltration , total volume infiltrate range 40-80 mL ( please refer specific determine total volume expansion ) . Following infiltration , tissue visibly expand minimal leakage . Total Volume Expansion : The Investigator must document total volume use surgery . - EXPAREL ( 20 mL ) + normal saline ( 20-60 mL base incision size ) = total volume . - For example : If infiltration sit 1.5 cm apart , 10 cm incision would 10 × 2 side × 3 layer = 60 cm . If 1 mL infiltrate every 1.5 cm , total volume would 40 mL . Screening : Subjects screen within 30 day prior study drug administration . During screen visit , must take place least 1 day prior surgery , subject assess past present neurologic , cardiac , general medical condition opinion Investigator would preclude study participation . After informed consent form ( ICF ) sign , medical/surgical history , physical examination , vital sign , 12-lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , neurological assessment , alcohol breath test , urine drug screen , urine pregnancy test woman childbearing potential conduct . Trained qualified Investigators use usual standard care surgical technique perform surgery . The use fentanyl analogue permit ( surgery ) . Intraoperative administration opioids analgesic , local anesthetic , anti-inflammatory agent prohibit unless need treat adverse event ( AE ) . Subjects must remain hospital least 72 hour surgery order undergo postsurgical assessment . In addition , subject must return 84 hour 96 hour study assessment . Day 7 Follow-Up Visit : All subject return Day 7 follow-up visit , include vital sign measurement , 12-lead ECG , neurological assessment , blood sample collection PK analysis , AE assessment . Postsurgical Safety Assessments : This include cardiac assessment ( i.e. , 12-lead ECG ) , neurological assessment , vital sign . Adverse event record time ICF sign Day 30 . If cardiac neurological AE special interest SAE occur study , unscheduled PK blood sample must collect . In addition , 12-lead ECG , vital sign , appropriate clinical laboratory test must conduct . Cardiac AEs special interest include chest pain ( angina , myocardial infarction ) , abnormal/irregular heart rate ( bradycardia , tachycardia , extrasystole ) , shortness breath require intervention . Neurologic AEs special interest include alter mental status/altered sensorium , rigidity , dysarthria , seizure , tremor , metallic taste , tinnitus , perioral numbness , visual disturbance , severe worsen dizziness . Additionally , follow event special interest persist occur beyond 72-hours postdose : dizziness , hyperesthesia , muscular twitching , tingling/paresthesia . Postsurgical Efficacy Assessments Will include pain intensity score use 10 cm visual analog scale ( VAS ) use supplemental opioid rescue medication . Pharmacokinetic Assessment : Blood sample PK analysis obtain predose ( Day 1 prior study drug administration ) ; 15 minute , 30 minute , 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 , 60 , 72 , 84 , 96 hour begin study drug administration ; Day 7 . Number Planned Patients enrollment 15 adult subject .</detailed_description>
