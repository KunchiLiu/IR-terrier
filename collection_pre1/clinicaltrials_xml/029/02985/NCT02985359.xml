	<brief_title>Impact Evaluation WFP-Implemented Nutrition Program Malawi</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prevalence child stunt high ( ~47 % ) Malawi . In response , Government Malawi , technical support WFP , launch 3.5 year comprehensive nutrition program provide small quantity Lipid-based Nutrient Supplement ( LNS ) comprehensive infant young child feeding ( IYCF ) water sanitation , hygiene ( WASH ) social behavior change communication ( SBCC ) package . The aim study evaluate impact comprehensive nutrition program reduce stunt improve linear growth child 6 24 month age improve infant young child feed knowledge practice rural Malawi . The study design quasi-experimental one program district one comparison district . The program impact evaluate use three round cross-sectional panel data baseline ( January-March , 2014 ) , midline ( January-March , 2015 ) , endline ( January-March , 2017 ) . Required sample size cross-sectional panel ( n = 2400 ; 1200 per district time point ) pregnant lactate Women ( n = 1200 ; 600 per district time point ) . The study also include following component : - Longitudinal study : Two longitudinal cohort child ( derive child age 6-7 month assess baseline mid-line ) follow every 6 month 24 month age . Sample size ~132 ; 66 per district cohort . As child main study , group assess anthropometry . - Qualitative study : qualitative study aim well understand facilitator barrier program participation , factor influence behavior change among target household . In-depth interview ( IDI ) mother ( n=34 ) household member ( n=15 ) , focus group discussion ( FGD ) community leader ( n=1 11 village chief ) program staff ( n=1 12 community leader action nutrition ( CLAN ) n=2 total 21 care group volunteer [ CGV ] ) elucidate perception program , Nutributter ( NB ) , SBCC message . - Process evaluation : The process evaluation focus describe test program 's implementation theory evaluate document program input , implementation process delivery , output . The process evaluation begin broad collection review available program document data , use development implementation program theory . To extent possible , study use exist coverage utilization data program 's monitoring system , collect additional data need fully diagram understand program implementation activity , procedure , fidelity program design . As final step , result process evaluation use illustrate program implementation activity may expect contribute program impact . - Cost effectiveness study : In addition calculate cost per child cover nutrition program Ntchisi , Malawi , investigator use incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ( ICER ) approach report cost per case stunting avert cost per 0.1 unit change mean length-for-age z-score ( LAZ ) .</detailed_description>
