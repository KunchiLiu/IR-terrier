	<brief_summary>This open-label , multi-center clinical trial , aim evaluate efficacy safety combination oral Navelbine Cisplatin follow metronomic oral Navelbine Patients advance Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer . The study comprise two stage . In 1st stage ( Week 1-12 ) , patient receive combination chemotherapy . In 2nd stage ( Week 13-25 ) , patient complete combination chemotherapy acceptable tolerance progressive disease ( PD ) allocate 2 arm , evaluate efficacy safety maintenance chemotherapy metronomic oral Navelbine ( Arm A ) regimen ( Arm B ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oral Navelbine Cisplatin Followed Metronomic Oral Navelbine Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In 1st stage ( Week 1-12 ) , patient receive combination chemotherapy , i.e . Platinum Navelbine , 4 cycle . The regimen : Navelbine oral 60mg/m2 d1,8 first cycle ; oral 80mg/m2 day1,8 sequential cycle q3w plus cisplatin : 75mg/m2 d1 q3w . In 2nd stage ( Week 13-25 ) , patient complete combination chemotherapy acceptable tolerance PD allocate 2 arm , evaluate efficacy safety maintenance chemotherapy metronomic oral Navelbine ( Arm A ) regimen ( Arm B ) . The allocation do sequence site , i.e. , first subject complete combination chemotherapy acceptable tolerance PD allocate Arm A , second allocate Arm B , . Arm A continue oral Navelbine 3 time weekly maintenance therapy , 12 week , till progression , unacceptable toxicity death occur . As contrast , Arm B receive therapy per physician 's choice . Arm A : Navelbine oral 50mg three time per week ( Day 1 , 3 , 5 week ) Arm B : Physician 's choice ( Navelbine oral ) compute tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) do screen visit , Week 7 , Week 13 ( initiation maintenance therapy ) , Week 19 ( 6 week maintenance therapy ) , Week 25 ( 12 week maintenance therapy ) , evaluate tumor response . The Disease Control Rate ( proportion patient complete response ( CR ) , partial response ( PR ) stable disease ( SD ) ) 6 week 12 week maintenance therapy evaluate separately 2 arm . And Arm B observational study , provide rationale control group select future study .</detailed_description>
