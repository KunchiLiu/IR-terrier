	<brief_summary>TLIF popular lumbar interbody fusion technique perform anterior interbody fusion . Pedicle screw provide initial stability develop correct deformity , improve rate fusion speed patient 's postoperative recovery . Conventionally , open approach require , use bilateral pedicle screw fixation provide stability gold standard . However , increase stiffness fuse segment reduce bone mineral content adjacent vertebra , biomechanical study indicate increased stress level adjacent fusion may increase adjacent segment pathology . Therefore , unilateral pedicle screw fixation consider mean decrease stiffness instrument segment . Recently , researcher show unilateral instrumented spinal fusion provide comparable result effective bilateral fixation . In addition , cost-effectiveness approach worthy attention . To knowledge , randomize controlled study compare unilateral versus bilateral instrument TLIF lumbar degenerative disease report . The purpose study compare clinical radiographic outcome series patient lumbar degenerative disease use instrumented TLIF unilateral bilateral pedicle screw fixation .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion : Signed informed consent . Patient willing available examination schedule study duration . Patient symptom low back pain leg pain , tingling , numbness weakness obviously affect daily life work ; Lumbar DDD diagnose use patient history imageconfirmation Has respond conservative treatment period 6 month ( e.g . bed rest , physical therapy , medication , manipulation , spinal injection , ) . Has systemic infection , highly communicable disease , inflammatory autoimmune disease ( e.g . osteomyelitis , crohn 's , rheumatoid arthritis , systemic lupus , gout , HIV/AIDS , active tuberculosis , venereal disease , active hepatitis ) . Has presence active malignancy Has history severe allergy Has significant medical history , investigator 's opinion , would make good study candidate . Pregnant , may become pregnant within followup period study Has spinal condition interfere clinical outcome ( e.g . spinal structural deformity , spinal fracture , ankylose spondylitis , spinal tuberculosis , spinal infection , spinal tumor , symptomatic cervical spinal disease ) Has undergone previous lumbar surgery Has severe osteoporosis ( Tscore â‰¤ 3.5 ) BMI &gt; 35kg/m2 Has diagnosis , require postoperative medication interfere fusion , steroid . Has history endocrine metabolic disorder know affect osteogenesis ( e.g . Paget 's disease , renal osteodystrophy , EhlersDanios syndrome osteogenesis imperfecta )</criteria>
