	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Intranasal Dexmedetomidine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study organize prospective , randomize , double-blind trial child meet study criterion randomly separate three test group ( IN DEX , MIDDEX , NOMIDDEX ) one control group ( CTRL ) . Patients schedule complete one quadrant dental care per sedation . Dental procedure perform include composite restoration , sealant , stainless steel crown , pulp therapy , extraction , exact number type dependant patient 's individual treatment plan . Group IN DEX receive placebo dose flavor water follow 3 mcg/kg intranasal dexmedetomidine conjunction 50/50 nitrous oxide/oxygen calculate flow rate . If adequate sedation obtain within 60 minute drug administration , sedation consider failure procedure terminate reschedule completion care use deep sedation general anesthesia , keep normal office policy . Second dos intranasal dexmedetomidine placebo give . Group MIDDEX receive 3 mcg/kg intranasal dexmedetomidine 0.5 mg/kg oral midazolam 100 % oxygen calculate flow rate ( oxygen administration function placebo nitrous oxide ) . If adequate sedation obtain within 60 minute drug administration , sedation consider failure procedure terminate reschedule completion care use deep sedation general anesthesia , keep normal office policy . Second dos intranasal dexmedetomidine oral midazolam give . Group NOMIDDEX receive 3 mcg/kg intranasal dexmedetomidine , 0.5 mg/kg oral midazolam , 50/50 nitrous oxide/oxygen calculate flow rate . If adequate sedation obtain within 60 minute drug administration , sedation consider failure procedure terminate reschedule completion care use deep sedation general anesthesia , keep normal office policy . Second dos intranasal dexmedetomidine oral midazolam give . The control group , Group CTRL , receive placebo dose normal saline 0.5 mg/kg oral midazolam 50/50 nitrous oxide/oxygen calculate flow rate . Midazolam chosen control due well documented history use pediatric procedural sedation . If adequate sedation obtain within 60 minute drug administration , sedation consider failure procedure terminate reschedule completion care use deep sedation general anesthesia , keep normal office policy . Second dos intranasal dexmedetomidine oral midazolam give . The initial flow rate nitrous oxide/oxygen calculate multiply patient 's respiratory rate estimate tidal volume . Tidal volume estimate 10 ml/kg . The flow rate adjust patient 's pulmonary need . At conclusion procedure , patient give 100 % oxygen least 5 minute allow recover stable vital sign , level consciousness , motor function , adequate hydration pain control discharge . All intranasal drug placebo administer use MAD300 Nasal Drug Delivery Device , manufacture Wolfe Tory . Typical particle size deliver nare 30-100 micron . The device 1.65 inch length , tip diameter .17 inch , internal dead space 0.07 ml . Dexmedetomidine draw manufacturer 's vial administer non-diluted ( 200 mcg/ml ) . The medication administer nearly immediately ( less 1 minute withdrawal original vial ) . A maximum 1ml administer per nare . All nasal administration drug placebos occur approximately 30 minute schedule procedure start time orally administration drug placebos occur approximately 15 minute schedule procedure start time . Administration inhale agent placebos begin approximately 5 minute prior schedule procedure start time . This delay allow coincident onset drug effect . In accordance Bon Secours policy evidence base guideline , vital sign patient monitor Bon Secours nurse time drug administration discharge . Pulse oximetry , heart rate , respiratory rate , end tidal CO2 monitor continuously . Blood pressure measure via appropriately size arm cuff every 5 minute , begin 5 minute prior first drug placebo administration end patient meet discharge criterion . The sedate dentist present supervisory role duration sedation remain immediately available patient discharge . In accordance Bon Secours policy , patient require history physical complete primary care provider maximum 30 day prior date procedure . Patients also require observe hospital pre-operative fasting guideline ( NPO solid , milk , formula &gt; 6 hour , breast milk &gt; 4 hour , clear liquid &gt; 2 hour ) . Topical local anesthesia ( 2 % lidocaine 1:100,000 epinephrine ) administer prior operative procedure facilitate pain control . Patient caregiver give appropriate post-operative instruction . Each patient follow phone call even procedure next day inquire complication whether child return baseline activity . Age , weight , gender , ASA status , dosages drug use , monitor provider , procedural time , adverse event , require intervention , quality sedation record . Apnea , desaturation , airway obstruction , bradycardia , hypotension , fever , inability complete procedure consider minor adverse event . Major adverse event define death , aspiration , cardiac arrest , unplanned hospital admission , level-of-care increase . If patient 3 consecutive blood pressure reading ( take 5 minute interval ) fall 5th percentile age , hypotension protocol initiate . The hypotension protocol consist : ( 1 ) Placement IV . ( 2 ) Administration 20 ml/kg IV normal saline every 5 minute ( maximum 60 ml/kg 15 minute ) ( 3 ) Concentration nitrous oxide reduce 25 % , applicable additional sedative agent administer ( 4 ) If blood pressure improve intervention patient remain adequately sedate , schedule dental procedure complete . ( 5 ) If intervention unsuccessful blood pressure improve , procedure terminate patient transferred emergency room level care increase . In event patient experience rage , agitation , paradoxical excitation , restrain use protective stabilization safety . Consent protective stabilization obtain consent sedation study participation obtain . Patient olfaction assess preoperatively postoperatively use standard anesthesia olfactory oil possible ( base pt age developmental status ) . Nasal mucosa examine preoperatively postoperatively attend sedationist . Abnormalities refer patient 's primary care provider . Sedation quality patient behavior evaluate use University Michigan sedation scale . Safety assess analyze adverse event . Efficacy assess analyze quality sedation base score University Michigan Scale .</detailed_description>
