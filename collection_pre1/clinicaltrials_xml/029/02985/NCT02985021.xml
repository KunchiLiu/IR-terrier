	<detailed_description>This phase 2 study combination docetaxel carboplatin patient germline inactivation gene homologous recombination pathway , include BRCA1 , BRCA2 , ATM . PRIMARY OBJECTIVE To assess rate 50 % Prostate Specific Androgen ( PSA ) decline docetaxel carboplatin EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES To assess PSA response duration docetaxel carboplatin To assess response measurable disease To assess time progression bone lesion measurable disease ( RECIST ) To assess response docetaxel carboplatin patient germline alteration somatic alteration DNA repair pathway gene ( BRCA1 , BRCA2 , ATM )</detailed_description>
