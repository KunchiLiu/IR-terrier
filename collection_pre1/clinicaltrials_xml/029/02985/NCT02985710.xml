	<brief_summary>Sudoscan™ ( Impeto Medical , Paris France ) use electrochemical skin conductance novel noninvasive method detect sudomotor dysfunction . Several small study recently show Sudoscan use assessment small fiber polyneuropathy ( diabetes mellitus ) perform non-invasively , quickly effectively . The investigator aim study use Sudoscan rare disease condition associate small fiber polyneuropathy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment Small Fiber Neuropathy Rare Diseases Using Sudoscan</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Small fiber polyneuropathy ( SFPN ) diagnose combination symptom , sign confirmatory diagnostic testing . Nerve conduction study sensitive enough case leave ankle skin biopsy measurement intraepidermal nerve fiber density ( IENFD ) main diagnostic tool . Despite utility reproducibility , skin biopsy invasive , expensive require central laboratory processing interpretation . Quantitative sudomotor axon reflex testing ( QSART ) also routinely used evaluation small fiber neuropathy sudomotor axon also involve . This test however remain technically challenging require test condition specialize lab always suitable patient ' population . By compare finding skin biopsy and/or QSRT , accept gold standard diagnose SFPN , investigator seek find fast , less-invasive way diagnose monitor small-fiber polyneuropathy rare diseases use Sudoscan measurement .</detailed_description>
