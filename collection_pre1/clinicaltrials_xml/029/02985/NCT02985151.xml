	<brief_title>Interventional Study Evaluate Appearance Surgical Scars After Laser Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In dermatology , use Light Amplification Stimulated Emission Radiation ( laser ) revolutionize management various condition include angioma , vitiligo , wrinkle , scar . ( Omi , 2014 Chapas , 2008 ) Scars result sub-optimal collagen production wound heal lead topographical irregularity . To effectively modify defect , treatment must capable penetrate epidermis elicit dermal remodel depth least 1 mm . The 10,600 nm carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) laser utilizes high energy short duration vaporize intra- extra-cellular water , result tissue ablation cause substantial thermal injury dermis , reduce likelihood additional scarring . The CO2 laser stimulate collagen production theoretically improve scar thickness , pliability , texture . This study prospective , randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled trial evaluate efficacy fractionate carbon dioxide laser improve surgical scar head neck 3-5 study visit duration 12.5 month . Scar assessment base objective change identify picture take Canfield Vectra M3 3D Imaging System subjective change identify Patient Observer Scar Assessment Scale ( POSAS ) , validate scar scale . As secondary objective , study evaluate tolerability laser , assess severity duration know side effect laser therapy erythema , edema , burn sensation , post-inflammatory pigment change , infection , scar , xerosis , pruritus , bronzing , adverse event arise follow treatment . Subjects give diary treatment document information .</detailed_description>
