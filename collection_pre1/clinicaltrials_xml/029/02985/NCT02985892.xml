	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Chronic nonspecific low back pain ( LCI ) high incidence world population lead disability . Several therapeutic approach study treat pathology , investigate efficacy one form treatment per group . Studies show effect Segmental Stabilization patient LCI , gap effect association trunk stretch segmental stabilization exercise pain disability LCI . Therefore , objective study investigate effect association trunk stretch segmental stabilization exercise chronic non-specific low back pain short medium term . Method / Design : It control , randomize , prospective , blind clinical trial quantitative approach , perform Clinical School Physiotherapy UFPB . Participants study 34 subject sexes , age 18 80 year , pain equal great 3 Numerical Pain Scale ( 0/10 ) randomize two group : Placebo Stretching Group + Segmental Stabilization ( n = 17 ) exercise placebo stretch segmental stabilization ; And Segmental Stretching-Stabilization Group ( n = 17 ) , submit segmental stabilization exercise associate trunk stretch ; Both group 12 session . The result pain intensity , functional capacity , overall effect perception , clinical-psycho-functional assessment , per IMMPACT recommendation clinical trial effectiveness efficacy treatment chronic pain , make blind After intervention , three six month randomization . Discussion : Because design , possible blind evaluator , randomizer , patient . At end research hope contribute clinical decision-making process choice therapy improve pain disability patient non-specific chronic low back pain .</detailed_description>
