	<brief_summary>( 1 ) Due miss childhood vaccination program , majority adult patient NAFLD Canada immunity hepatitis B . ( 2 ) Adults NAFLD receive HBV vaccine reduce immunogenic response set obesity ( i.e. , protective anti-HBs titre ) . Aims : ( 1 ) To determine sero-prevalence immunity hepatitis B cohort prospectively evaluate adult NAFLD patient . ( 2 ) To prospectively determine HBV vaccine response ( anti-HBs titre ) adult NAFLD patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Prospective Study HBV Immunity HBV Vaccination Patients With NAFLD Canada</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) truly global human pathogen affect least 2 billion people worldwide include ~240 million chronic hepatitis B ( CHB ) carrier risk end-stage liver disease . The diagnosis CHB confirm persistence HBV surface antigen ( HBsAg ) serum &gt; 6 month . However , latent form HBV infection know occult hepatitis B infection ( OBI ) characterize low-level viremia ( i.e. , HBV DNA &lt; 200 IU/ml ) despite undetectable serum HBsAg describe unclear clinical consequence . A safe effective HBV vaccine available ~3 decade consist recombinant HBsAg contain major viral antigenic epitope induces protective neutralize antibody HBsAg ( anti-HBs ) response &gt; 85 % child vaccinate . Canada low HBV-endemic region Alberta , Ontario , public health use maternal screen HBsAg identify baby at-risk CHB . Thus , infant bear HBsAg ( + ) mother give passive-active immunoprophylaxis hepatitis B immune globulin ( HBIG ) HBV vaccine within 12 hour birth , well 2 dos ~2 ~6 month age . Testing infant anti-HBs recommend 9 month ensure immunity . In late 1990 's , universal HBV childhood vaccination program initiate Canadian province jurisdiction . In Alberta Ontario , school-age child schedule receive 3-dose HBV vaccine series grade 5 . However remain significant proportion adult Canadians ( i.e. , born 1985 ) miss childhood vaccination program . Although current guideline recommend certain high-risk population receive hepatitis B immunization , appropriate identification compliance generally much low adult compare child . According recent Canadian Association Study Liver Disease guideline , adult diabetes , well patient chronic liver disease receive hepatitis B vaccine . The basis recommendation two-fold , ( 1 ) diabetic may risk blood-borne virus ( BBV ) exposure contact contaminate blood glucose monitoring device ( 2 ) diabetic patient increase risk metabolic syndrome development non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) . The improvement blood glucose monitoring device , increase knowledge reduce risk HBV exposure patient diabetes . Further , investigator ' initial seroepidemiological survey acute HBV outbreaks Alberta reveal decrease prevalence diabetic patient . Therefore main incentive HBV vaccination diabetic due concomitant risk metabolic syndrome advance liver disease due NAFLD . There limited data HBV vaccination NAFLD patient . Further study require North American adult ( Canadian population ) . The investigator propose adult NAFLD undergo comprehensive screening hepatitis B immunogenicity , addition screen infection , catch booster vaccination administer non-immunized patient confirmatory immunity test thereafter .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects 1860 year age , provide sign informed consent Diagnosis NAFLD/NASH accord expert assessment ( image , TE , abnormal lab test and/or liver biopsy ) No evidence prior infection immunity hepatitis B ( negative HBsAg , antiHBs , antiHBc ) . Subjects &lt; 18 year age , Subjects refuse vaccination Have document immunity / prior exposure hepatitis B ( i.e. , positive antHBs , antiHBc , HBsAg ) Pregnancy HIVpositive Decompensated cirrhosis ( i.e. , ChildPugh Class B C ) due impact immune response . Subjects &gt; 60 exclude , due effect age reduce response HBV vaccination .</criteria>
