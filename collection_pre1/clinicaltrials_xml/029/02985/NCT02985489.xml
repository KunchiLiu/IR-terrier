	<brief_title>Pre-Operative Parenteral Nutrition Malnourished Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective To determine impact pre-operative PN therapy malnourish patient IBD compare standard care nutritional therapy development total post-operative complication . Secondary Objectives To assess impact pre-operative PN therapy malnourish patient IBD compare standard care nutritional therapy incidence post-operative infectious complication Primary Endpoint The primary endpoint incidence post-surgical complication malnourish patient receive pre-operative PN therapy compare standard care therapy Secondary Endpoints The secondary endpoint cumulative incidence post-operative infectious complication IBD patient receive surgery hospital length stay patient receive pre-operative PN therapy compare standard care nutritional therapy METHODS Study Design This prospective multi-center randomize control study . Allocation either intervention control group randomize base block system ( size 4 ) . The randomization sequence computer generate . Conjoint Ethics Review Board Approval study protocol seek conventional manner . Withdrawal Criteria ( ) If catheter - related complication ( include infection ) result catheter removal ; ( b ) If patient meet goal therapeutic PN rate ; ( c ) If duration PN initiation surgery le 7 day ( e.g . patient need emergency surgical intervention ) Recruitment Consent The overwhelming majority patient IBD admit Gastroenterology Inpatient Service . As , recruitment study take multi-pronged approach stream-lined . All Gastroenterologists Gastroenterology ( GI ) Fellows train FMC PLC make aware protocol rounding , aware ask eligible patient would willing speak research assistant study participation . In addition , research coordinator assign study review inpatient electronic medical record , Sunrise Clinical Manager ( SCM ) daily identify newly admit inpatient study site IBD . The research coordinator review study eligibility newly admit inpatient GI Fellows rotate GI service , approach patient protocol review consent deem eligible . All participant undergo prospective consenting via write informed consent either family member . Study Intervention Experimental Group Participants assign experimental group commence PN therapy deliver central venous catheter ( CVC ) access within 24-48 hour admission . For study , Olimel use PN formulation choice . Specifically , Olimel 5.7 % electrolyte prefer study product . CVC access readily obtain FMC PLC within duration central venous access team designate team purpose . A registered dietitian ( RD ) specifically recruit study prescribe PN eligible patient base individualized nutritional assessment . Eligible patient malnourish definition , result conservative initial PN dose minimize risk refeeding syndrome . The study RD calculate energy requirement base predictive equation , Harris Benedict Equation determine target goal . The target protein calorie requirement meet within 48-72 hour PN initiation . The optimal duration delivery PN preoperatively define Klein et al , support earlier meta-analysis Detsky et al . The Klein meta-analysis 14 prospective randomize trial show consistent benefit preoperative PN , show 10 % reduction overall postoperative complication . Thirteen 14 study meta-analysis provide PN least 7 day , lead Klein suggestion use PN consider unless duration therapy anticipate minimum 7 day . In accordance , PN administer minimum 7-days prior surgery . Control Group Participants assign control group receive standard care ( SOC ) nutritional therapy . Control group patient assess RD assign medical unit patient admit ( independent RD assessment ) . The unit RD follow standard nutrition screening process determine nutrition risk , follow complete nutrition assessment presence nutrition risk . Conventionally , patient complete calorie count clinical observation unit RD , nutrition support , typically enteral nutrition recommend oral intake inadequate . Failure EN meet goal calorie intake may result PN therapy discretion unit RD treat team .</detailed_description>
