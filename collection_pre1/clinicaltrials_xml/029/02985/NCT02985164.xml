	<brief_summary>Radiation become dreadful effect outcomes tremendous expect . As result , anesthetists become inevitable target radiation exposure since monitor patient closely operation . Unfortunately , radiation may immediate sequela , accumulation adverse effect . These sequelae happen mean direct exposure reflection . The reflected ray inversely proportional distance origin target . Practically , radiation source protect individual cover glass shield . Siriraj hospital tertiary , general university hospital 2,200 bed . Annually , Endoscopy centre 700 patient undergoing endoscopic retrograde cholangio pancreaticography ( ERCP ) . Normally , fluoroscopy pancreatic biliary duct visualisation need anesthesia . Though procedure operate well-equipped , radiating-protection room ; many medical personnel include 1-2 endoscopists , 2 scrub nurse , 1-2 anesthetist 1 x-ray man , still chance irradiation . During ERCP , medical personnel particularly anesthetist rinse radiation . Though always wear lead apron collar shield protect ray , normally position - le 1 meter - close fluoroscopy . Due advancement technology , anesthetists remotely monitor patient surgical procedure . This might cause less effect ray upon . As result , whether position anesthesia personnel relate distance x-ray source would help alleviate effect radiation exposure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study approve Siriraj IRB . Inclusion criteria patient underwent ERCP procedure . Exclusion criteria none . The project terminate 19 August 2016 A total 222 case include without need inform consent . At Endoscopic unit A nurse anesthetist perform venous cannulation right forearm transfuse 5 % dextrose half-strength normal saline . Then patient transfer ERCP theatre . The patient monitor non-invasive blood pressure ( NIBP ) , percutaneous arterial oxygen saturation ( SpO2 ) , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) administer oxygen 3LPM via nasal cannula . A co-researcher reset prepare 4 pocket dosimeter ( PDS ) label PDSa1 , PDSa2 , PDSb1 PDSb2 . The PDSa1 PDSa2 place outside inside lead shirt respectively . The shirt-covered box close anesthetic machine . This box would represent anesthetic personnel duty mark position A . The PDSb1 PDSb2 place outside inside glass shield control room respectively . This glass shield would represent personnel work operate theatre mark position B . Both position A B 160 cm . floor . After anesthesiologist administer narcotic induction agent patient ( total intravenous anaesthesia , TIVA ) , endoscopist commenced procedure . A co-researcher turn PDS device soon surgeon start fluoroscopy , turn whenever use radiative source . When study complete , PDA device keep solid dry place . The lead apron hang specific area cover bag . The device A lead apron 0.5 mm . 0.25 mm . thickness front back ( BT medical ) respectively . A thyroid shield 0.5 mm . thickness . A paper box 30x1510 cm . dimension . A radiative dosimeter ( Ludlum model 25-IS &amp; 25-IS-1 Personal Radiation Monitor , 501 Oak street , Sweetwater , Texas , USA ) characteristic detail follow : Ludlum model 25-IS &amp; Model 25-IS-1 Radiation detect Gamma ( X ray ) typically &lt; 18 count per minute per milliroentgen/hr . Beta response typically &lt; 0.10 milliroentgen/hr Display range For 25-IS : 0.01 milliroentgen/hr 10 sievert/hr For 25-IS-1 : 0.01 millisievert/hr 10 sievert/hr Size . 7.6 x5.4x1.7 cm ( H x W x thickness ) Weight . 158.6 g. Including battery Linearity . Reading within 10 % true value within calibration range Analysis data Data express mean standard deviation analyse use SPSS version 18.0 . Categorical data compare use Chi-square test ; , record data use dependent t-test . A p &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant difference 95 % confidence interval .</detailed_description>
