	<brief_summary>The investigator aim address issue novel image quantification method use CZT-based SPECT , capable dynamic data acquisition therefore feasible quantification coronary flow . The investigator use kinetic modeling technique design study allow absolute flow quantification . To make study practical , investigator develop protocol include acquisition rest stress scan within scan shorter 30 minute . The SPECT-measured flow validate flow measure cardiac MRI scan . Patients high CAD risk recruit clinical trial . Data human subject use determination performance develop algorithm . With proposed rapid scan absolute quantification capability , investigator expect increase diagnosis accuracy maintain patient throughput .</brief_summary>
