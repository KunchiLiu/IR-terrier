	<detailed_description>The study single-center , randomize , 2-arm , crossover design . Twelve healthy men woman age 20-45 recruited study . Interested subject ask come Clinical Nutrition Research Center ( CNRC ) IIT Campus , Chicago , IL , study take place screen visit determine eligible participate study . The screening visit take 2-2.5 hour . Prospective subject must read , sign date write Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) approve Informed Consent Form prior perform study procedure . At on-site screen visit , subject ask arrive overnight fast 10-12 hour well-hydrated . Subject instructed aim water intake least 8-10 cup 24 hour screen visit . Determine eligibility participate include subject complete series questionnaire related health , medication use , dietary habit , physical activity history . Anthropocentric ( height , weight waist circumference ) , ear temperature , vital sign ( blood pressure heart rate ) measure . Body mass index ( BMI ) calculate height weight measurement . BMI estimate body fat base height weight applies adult men woman . Fasting blood glucose level capillary blood finger prick test . For vital sign measurement , subject sit comfortable chair , foot uncrossed floor ask rest quietly 5 minute measure blood pressure heart rate . Arm vein assess use vein access scale test . Subject instructed complete 24-hour food recall . Based result questionnaire , BMI calculation , health evaluation 24-hour food recall , subject meet inclusion exclusion criterion invite participate study . Eligible subject train instructed record food beverage consume 3-day period food record diary . Study staff provide food record form train subject . Eligible participant ask come center two test day . Test Day 1 follow screen visit least 7 day washout adhere diet instruction . At Test Day visit , subject arrive clinic 7 9 fast 10 12 hour well-hydrated well-rested state . If take medication ( ) morning , ask take medication ( ) home instead bring clinical nutrition center take presence study investigator medication ( ) take time Study Day visit . Study protocol adherence corroborate ask period fast state .

Subjects experience unusual stressful event ( loss job , loss love one , divorce , etc… ) reschedule late time agree upon subject investigator . Subject ask medication intake health status since last visit ensure subject maintain good health medication intake . After confirm compliance protocol , anthropometric measurement vital sign ( blood pressure , heart rate ear temperature ) take . A finger prick fast blood glucose take confirm subject fasting . A licensed healthcare professional ( LHCP ) evaluate place catheter antecubital site subject 's non-dominant arm . A catheter thin flexible tube allow sample blood one port throughout Study Day . Once catheter place , baseline blood sample take ( Time point T -5 ) . Subject ask rest 5 minute , another baseline blood sample take ( T 0 ) . After complete 2 baseline blood sampling , subject receive serve 100 % orange juice 100 % orange juice orange pomace fiber base computer generate randomization sequence . The randomization sequence assign subject first Study Day visit ( Test Day 1 ) . Additional blood sample take 15 , 30 , 45 , 60 , 75 , 90 , 105 120 minute start orange juice .
