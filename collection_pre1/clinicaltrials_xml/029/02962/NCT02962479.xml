	<brief_summary>This study aim compare biological community stool sample obtain age , diet BMI-matched subject five study group : subject ankylose spondylitis ( AS ) never treat tumor necrose factor ( TNF ) inhibitor , subject ankylose spondylitis previously currently treat TNF inhibitor , subject non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis ( nrSpA ) never treat tumor necrose factor ( TNF ) inhibitor , subject non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis previously currently treat TNF inhibitor healthy participant . The difference fecal microbiota composition explore use shotgun metagenomic sequencing University Washington . The investigator predict study confirm significant difference fecal microbiota composition ( FMC ) AS nrSpA patient control .</brief_summary>
