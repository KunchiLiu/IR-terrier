	<brief_title>Exercise Prior Oesophagectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The number patient oesophageal cancer rise dramatically UK . Curative cancer surgery ( oesophagectomy ) offer around 40 % affected patient . However , oesophagectomy major operation high risk complication . Around 1 3 patient suffer complication surgery , mostly due heart lung problem . Most complication due surgery , related patient 's physical fitness operation . Studies surgery , oesophagectomy , show complication may reduce improve patient 's physical fitness operation . The ExPO team develop pre-operative Personalised Exercise Programme ( my-PEP ) , specifically patient undergo oesophagectomy . my-PEP 4 main component : three exercise modality ( aerobic exercise , breathe exercise muscle strengthen ) ; fourth participant 's potential barrier exercise assessed behavioural change technique ( BCTs ) suggest improve exercise engagement trial . In total , 32 patient due undergo oesophagectomy Norfolk Norwich Hospital recruit randomly divide 2 arm 16 . One arm receive my-PEP standard 3-4 month prior surgery , receive standard care advice exercise home . The research objectives obtain feasibility data whether my-PEP acceptable , adhered safe , whether improves patient fitness standard care . Follow 90 day surgery obtain preliminary imprecise estimate whether my-PEP reduces complication . If ExPO trial show promise area , inform justify future large multi-centre trial definitively answer whether my-PEP reduce complication oesophagectomy . If , my-PEP could potentially change improve pre-operative management oesophageal cancer patient across NHS .</detailed_description>
