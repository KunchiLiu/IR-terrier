	<brief_summary>The purpose study try find critically ill patient receive antibiotic , ceftolozane-tazobactam , process body . Investigators would like study antibiotic concentration dose antibiotic reach right concentration necessary kill bacteria cause infection . The process drug travel body blood , broken remove body call pharmacokinetics ( PK ) . We measure PK take blood sample specific time antibiotic give . Investigators would like study patient receive dialysis patient receive dialysis . This information antibiotic process critically ill patient unknown important know whether dos doctor give patient fight infection adequate . If antibiotic concentration low blood , give bacteria opportunity become resistant antibiotic lead antibiotic less effective bacteria potentially expose future patient infection limited range effective antibiotic . Patients consent , give antibiotic prescribed . Blood sample take drip already patient arm antibiotic start , 15 45 minute , 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 8 hour . Patients dialysis blood sample take dialysis machine blood reach dialysis filter ( blood sample non dialysis patient ) also blood sample take filter 45 minute , 2 6 hour . Dialysis patient also 5 separate sample ultrafiltrate take ( approximately 10mls ) - ultrafiltrate waste product dialysis process . The total amount blood 40mls equal 2 tablespoon . The dialysis patient 50mls blood taken.Information patient ICU stay also record .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Ceftolozane-tazobactam recently emerge highly valuable option management severe Gram-negative infection include cause multi-drug resistant ( MDR ) organism , demonstrate superior antibacterial activity pathogens frequently cause serious infection critically ill , Pseudomonas aeruginosa Enterobacteriaceae spp , compare commonly use beta-lactam antibiotic . Although continued reduction pathogen susceptibility commonly use antibiotic ICUs could multifactorial , potential contribution inappropriate antibiotic exposure undoubtedly significant . Numerous clinical study report sub-therapeutic antibiotic concentration ICU patient across different antibiotic class , conventional dosing regimen . This due mark change pharmacokinetics ( PK ) pharmacodynamics ( PD ) antibiotic critically ill arise disease-related physiological change . Ceftolozane structural analogue ceftazidime , share similar PK property ceftazidime , beta-lactams , short half-life 2 hour , distribution extracellular fluid , predominant renal elimination , make vulnerable disease-related PK alteration critically ill. Inappropriate antibiotic exposure ICU also arise due use extracorporeal therapy continuous renal replacement therapy ( CRRT ) . Many beta-lactam antibiotic share similar physicochemical PK property ceftolozane efficiently clear CRRT machine . However extent total drug clearance CRRT variable due different modality operational setting across different institution , also due variable residual renal clearance associate degree renal impairment . The traditional dosing consideration patient undergo CRRT mainly focus notion renal impairment generally consider low dos without give appropriate consideration possibly high extracorporeal clearance , thus risk dose . In similar fashion , product information ceftolozane-tazobactam prescriber 's information United States Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) , recommend ten-fold lower-than-normal dose use renal replacement therapy ( maintenance dose 150mg versus 1.5g normal renal function ) . However , date limit data clinical study CRRT ICU patient confirm low dose provide appropriate antibiotic exposure . Lessons study beta-lactams suggest ceftolozane may subject extensive variable clearance CRRT . It therefore , essential describe adequacy dose patient receive CRRT , give fact several additional pathophysiological factor affect PK PD antibiotic even absence extracorporeal circuit . This prospective observational study describe , firstly , PK ceftolozane-tazobactam ICU patient receive CRRT , secondly , influence CRRT PK dose requirement ceftolozane-tazobactam critically ill patient . This study generate new PK data ICU patient describe exposure ceftolozane-tazobactam recommend dose regimen thereby allow assessment adequacy and/or define appropriate dosing . Further , provide invaluable insight alter dose need patient receive CRRT enable use patient prediction necessary dosing correction account due effect CRRT .</detailed_description>
