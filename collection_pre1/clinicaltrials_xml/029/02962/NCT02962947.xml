	<brief_title>MELABLOCK : A Clinical Trial Efficacy Safety Propranolol 80 mg Melanoma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cutaneous malignant melanoma ( CMM ) represent major public health problem.Although melanoma account 4 % dermatologic cancer , responsible 80 % deaths skin cancer ; 14 % patient metastatic melanoma survive five year . The probability survival melanoma stage II/IIIA 15 year around 50 % . Treatment dacarbazine , fotemustine , temozolomide , interferon -- -α interleukin -- -2 propose metastatic melanoma , drug exert poor efficacy . More recently , ipilimumab , block cytotoxic T -- -lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 potentiate antitumor T -- -cell response approve treatment HLA -- -A*0201-positive patient unresectable stage III IV melanoma . This treatment find delay mortality 4 month , although , clinical trial fraction patient live much longer . However , drug cause severe fatal side effect almost 13 % patient , prompt FDA qualify approval mitigation strategy . There 14 death relate study drug ( 2.1 % ) , 7 associate immune -- -related adverse event . These finding suggest use ipilimumab non metastatic patient . After surgical resection specific pharmacotherapy recommend patient stage II/IIIA CMM metastases find . β -- -adrenoceptor antagonist ( β -- -blockers ) belong one widely use class drug clinical practice . Their use mainly direct chronic management hypertension , although also prescribe ischemic heart disease , heart failure , anxiety , tremor , migraine glaucoma , Initial pharmacoepidemiological evidence show β -- -blockers may reduce cancer risk . Indeed , β -- - blocker report exert certain degree protection prostate cancer . More recently , β -- -blocker treatment concomitant diseases find significantly reduce distant metastasis , cancer recurrence , cancer -- -specific mortality breast cancer patient . Infantile hemangiomas common benign tumor infancy . Over last year , propranolol become popular successful treatment infantile hemangioma . The ability ß -- -adrenoceptors increase vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) subsequent angionenetic pathway contribute identification mechanism primary target ß -- -blockers limit cancer progression treat hemangioma . The recent observation propranolol treat successfully case infantile lymphangiomatosis simulatneously reduce VEGF level strengthen hypothesis . Preclinical study propose activation β -- - adrenoceptors play detrimental role melanoma , vitro study show melanoma tissue express β1 -- - β2 -- -adrenoceptors isoproterenol potent inducer VEGF , IL -- -8 IL -- -6 gene expression human melanoma cell support role β -- - adrenoceptors pathway . Thus , role ß -- -adrenoceptors promote angiogenesis , support basic clinical evidence , represent robust work hypothesis explain beneficial effect ß-blockers indifferent model cancer , include melanoma . In prospective cohort 121 consecutive patient thick melanoma ( Breslow &gt; 1 ) , investigator recently find use β -- -blockers concomitant disease 1 year associate reduce risk CMM recurrence . After median follow -- -up time 2.5 year , tumor progression observe 3.3 % treat ( n=30 ) subgroup 34.1 % untreated ( n=91 ) subgroup . Cox model progression indicate 36 % ( 95 % CI : 11 % -- -54 % ; P=.002 ) risk reduction year β -- -blocker use . No death observe treated group , whereas untreated group 24 patient die . This study suggest first time exposure β -- -blockers associate reduce risk progression thick CMM . In large group 741 patient thick thin CMM invetigators recently confirm association β -- -blocker prescription ( 79 patient ) reduction risk CMM recurrence death . The investigator hypothesize treatment propranolol reduces risk recurrence CMM decrease overall mortality . Study Design The investigator propose randomize double -- -blind placebo -- -controlled clinical trial ( RTC ) evaluate whether treatment propranolol 80 mgR/die reduce risk CMM recurrence mortality . Patients resect stage II/IIIA CMM recruit various Centers Italy . Participants randomly assign propranolol treatment placebo ( 1:1 ratio ) , treat least 1 year follow 2 year . Recruitment proceed simultaneously different Centers , complete 2 year . Complete physical examination , measure study compliance perform baseline , well interim visit , every 4 month . The primary outcome entire trial , however , estimate assess reduction overall mortality five year . The invetigators also evaluate general CMM recurrence CMM specific mortality . Study population/Study Sites The propose RCT conduct across Dermatology Plastic Surgery center primarily Tuscany also sit Italy necessary additional European country . The end follow-up determine recurrence , death , last day follow-up . Recruitment , Randomization Treatment Assignment Potential study participant recruit among patient treat Dermatology Plastic Surgery center Tuscany/Italy . All screened subject center assign ID number irrespective whether randomized receive study treatment . Randomization perform use web -- -based procedure . Randomization patient number participant generate computer two treatment assignment . Unblinding provided recruitment , data collection , laboratory analysis whole follow complete . Protection confidentiality achieve limited access database . At baseline invetigators also measure anthropometric variable weight , height . Arterial blood pressure , pulse rate ECG record . Subjects enrol ask : hormone therapy , statin use ; medical condition xeroderma pigmentosum , basal cell nevus syndrome , lupus erythematosus , organ transplantation immunosuppressive therapy ; history psoriasis ; history depression ; concomitant medication . The participant ask return recruitment clinic 13 follow -- -up visit month 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 20 , 24 , 28 , 32 , 36 , 42 , 48 , 54 60 . At alternate visit receive next 8 month supply medication study participant . The physician perform complete physical examination , include measurement body weight , blood pressure pulse rate , ass general health study participant . We collect -- -dated information health status sign recurrence melanoma . Dosage Administration Study participant randomize 80 mgR propranolol daily placebo . Concomitant medication Patients discourage take unspecified medication . However medication , vitamin mineral supplement herbs take participant document Case Report Form ( CRF ) include : start stop date , dose route administration , indication use . Methods monitor adherence The following method adherence monitoring use : blister evaluation subject self -- - reporting , keep current practice investigator rely heavily tool . Withdrawal criterion Study Participants able withdraw study time . Reason subject discontinuation may include : recurrence , adverse event compromise patient 's ability participate study , serious acute emergency ( i.e. , heart attack , stroke acute abdomen surgery ) . Subjects discontinue treatment encourage participate follow -- -up examination maintain intention -- -to -- -treat analysis . After 3 year treatment patient terminate intervention period follow annual basis 2 year unless early termination study . After 546 patient randomize , accrual close . When last randomized subject conclude 3 year treatment 2 year follow -- -up , study consider close . The Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) , Ethics Committee regulatory authority make decision terminate study earlier . This decision could base factor unacceptable adverse event , poor accrual compliance interim analysis . Staffing Scheduling Coordinating Centre Field Activities : study study coordination center Department Preclinical Clinical Pharmacology University Florence , coordinate different aspect study field conduction . Prof. Alessandro Mugelli expert cardiopharmacology , Prof. Niccolò Marchionni , expert clinical cardiology Dr. Sara Gandini , expert data management biostatistics assist Dr. Vincenzo De Giorgi Prof. Pierangelo Geppetti coordination study . The clinical investigator lead PI , Dr. Vincenzo De Giorgi , responsible study recruitment , clinical examination patient assess patient safety . Study set-up take approximately 6 month occur begin funding period . After 6 month study set -- -up period 9 year active data collection period ( i.e. , time first person enter trial last person complete final 24 month follow-up visit ) , last 6 month study close -- -out activity . These activity include final data entry cleaning , final data analysis , report writing . The entire study begin study set-up end study close-out take 7 year complete ( two year accrual , 3 year treatment , 2 year follow-up ) . Sample size calculation Results previous prospective study 741 melanoma patient show , median follow -- -up time 4 year , Cox-regression model overall mortality indicate 38 % ( 95 % CI : 10 % -- -57 % ; P=.02 ) risk reduction year β -- blocker use . Cautiously , consider hazard ratio 0.6 randomize placebo-controlled phase-II trial . A total sample size 546 ( split equally two group ) give u 90 % power estimate improvement OS five year achieve 90 % power detect improvement give survival five year 0.70 increase 0.82 treatment group ) significance level ( alpha ) 0.05 use two -- -sided log rank test . These result assume 3 sequential test make use O'Brien-Fleming spending function determine test boundary hazard proportional .</detailed_description>
