	<brief_title>Multicenter Prospective Cumulus Cell Test Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Currently , embryo selection embryo transfer do basis morphological characteristic . The morphology base selection procedure limit predictive value . The need additional oocyte/embryo evaluate method therefore require . This method preferentially : non invasive , objective , available early development . Each oocyte surround cumulus cell , cell normally dispose assisted reproductive technique ( ART ) -procedure . A diagnostic test base cumulus cell fit al require criterion . In current study use oocyte diagnostic test base cumulus cell gene expression evaluate . Primary purpose : Validate non invasive diagnostic test , cure infertility condition improve ART-treatment reduce physical psychological effect ( eventually fail ) ART procedure potential side effect procedure patient . Quality assurance plan Data check Source Data Verification : The aim , study design , eligible patient population , study plan specific requirement discuss several occasion test site . Clear collaborative agreement make partner involve study . These stipulate study protocol require action party specific time point communication procedure . A trial initiation meeting conduct site PI . Interim evaluations site monitor validation data registration foreseen . These initiate soon 10 patient include study occur every extra 5 patient include . Data check verification foresee regular basis do train study manager different study center . Definitions : For study patient match control serum human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) measure day 14-17 pick . If positive , hCG follow day 20 25 ( positive beta-hCG Pregnancy ) . All patient positive hCG follow : 1 ) detect development foetal sac positive heartbeat week 7-8 pregnancy ( Clinical Pregnancy ) , 2 ) routine ultrasound evaluation week 12 , 20 32 pregnancy , 3 ) data delivery child health ( Live Birth ) . The total number pregnancy obtain stimulation cycle include study refer Cumulative Pregnancy study group . Study design Data analysis : The study prospective match control assessor blind study . Most detail study design already describe else ware document . It however note assessor perform additional diagnosis oocytes use CC-Test blind eventual development oocyte embryo quality embryo base morphology . Sample size assess base retrospective study perform Follicle Biology research laboratory ( FOBI ) UZBrussel . These indicate ongoing pregnancy rate ( OPR ) two control group 30-40 % expect OPR 50 % -70 % number participant require 20 distinguish difference power 80 % . For reason least 30 informative patient include study arm test site . Clinical patient data related inclusion exclusion criterion available evaluate local investigator prior enrolment patient study . Absence data related evaluation ART procedure outcome exclude patient analysis . Data inconsistency range result consider absent data . The statistical analysis result perform professional statistician experience field , terminology endpoint , use best fit statistical method endpoint . For analysis primary secondary endpoint include amongst others : Chi-square analysis , Kaplan-Meier analysis multiple regression analysis , base generalize linear model . Interim analysis : A first evaluation do 20 case , transfer CC-Test , complete . This comprise data positive beta-hCG pregnancy , clinical pregnancy ( 7weeks ) .</detailed_description>
