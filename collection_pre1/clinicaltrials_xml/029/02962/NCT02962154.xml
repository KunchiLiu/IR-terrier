	<brief_summary>The purpose project answer fundamental question mechanisms underlying mental stress ischemia patient coronary artery disease , mood disorder , , identify potential biomarkers psychosocial risk factor associate condition . To achieve goal , investigator use cutting-edge cardiovascular functional neuroimaging tool study mental stress ischemia carefully control laboratory setting subject recruit four patient population : 1 ) patient recently sustain myocardial infarction ; 2 ) patient undergo non-emergent invasive coronary angiography ( without know coronary artery disease ) ; 3 ) patient diagnosis major depressive disorder ; 4 ) patient diagnosis bipolar 1 bipolar 2 disorder .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Mental stress ischemia occur psychosocial mental stressor trigger imbalance supply demand oxygen cardiac myocytes . Epidemiological study indicate mental stress ischemia common , occur 20-25 % patient coronary artery disease ( CAD ) portend poor prognosis . The underlying mechanism think involve stress-induced activation sympathetic nervous system associate effect cardiovascular function . But neurobiological cardiovascular factor interact generate mental stress ischemia unknown . Furthermore , patient major depressive disorder , bipolar disorder , stress-related psychiatric condition elevate rate cardiovascular co-morbidities , include sudden cardiac death , yet mental stress ischemia study extensively psychiatric population . The purpose project answer fundamental question mechanisms underlying mental stress ischemia patient coronary artery disease , mood disorder , , identify potential biomarkers psychosocial risk factor associate condition . To achieve goal , investigator use cutting-edge cardiovascular functional neuroimaging tool study mental stress ischemia carefully control laboratory setting subject recruit four patient population : 1 ) patient recently sustain myocardial infarction ; 2 ) patient undergo non-emergent invasive coronary angiography ( without know coronary artery disease ) ; 3 ) patient diagnosis major depressive disorder ; 4 ) patient diagnosis bipolar 1 bipolar 2 disorder .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Cardiac Subjects : 1 . Male female subject , age 50 year 2 . Able provide inform consent . Must fluent english speaker . 3 . Known coronary artery disease ( CAD ) define prior PCI , CABG , prior MI , prior abnormal stress test invasive coronary angiography ( ICA ) 4 . Patients hemodynamically stable Exclusion Criteria Cardiac subject : 1 . Evidence ongoing myocardial infarction homonymic instability 2 . Positive pregnancy test unknown pregnant state time enrollment woman childbearing potential 3 . Known contraindication cardiovascular CT angiography intravenous contrast ( A ) Known allergy ( B ) Renal dysfunction ( GFR &lt; 30ml/min ) ( C ) Contraindications betablockers nitroglycerin adenosine ( D ) Irregular heart rate control administration betablockers 4 . Patients contraindication MRI scan ( A ) NonMR compatible device material implant ( B ) Known allergy gadolinium contain contrast agent ( C ) Renal dysfunction ( GFR &lt; 30 ml/min ) Inclusion Criteria Psychiatric Subjects 1 . Male female subject , age 50 year 2 . Must fluent Englishspeakers due design mental stress task . Able provide inform consent . 3 . Subjects stable meet DSMV criterion diagnosis major depressive disorder , bipolar 1 disorder , bipolar 2 disorder , assess initial screen interview phone confirm structured clinical interview first day study . Exclusion Criteria Psychiatric Subjects : 1 . Subjects history seizure disorder , stroke , Parkinson 's disease , form dementia , head injury result loss consciousness exclude study . 2 . Contraindications MRI assess screen interview use NYPresbyterian Hospital MRI Checklist prior scan also serve exclusion criterion . They include claustrophobia ; history metal implant ( include brace , orthopedic implant , cochlear implant , implanted cardiac pacemaker , implant cardioverter defibrillator , ocular implant ) ; weight 250 pound ( owe size MR scanner bore ) ; woman currently pregnant breastfeed . 3 . Subjects indicate chance may pregnant ask take pregnancy test . They inform potential false positive result due diet , vitamin , supplement , overthecounter medication . A positive pregnancy test necessitate exclusion study , result disclose participant . 4 . Patients currently treat beta blocker daily ( stand ) benzodiazepine exclude , unless , judgment prescribe physician , dose withheld morning study session , due potential medication mask neurobiological cardiovascular response mental stress . 5 . Investigators also assess additional psychiatric exclusion criterion screen interview structure clinical interview : patient bipolar 1 disorder currently manic ; patient mood disorder currently complicate hallucination , delusion , psychotic feature ; patient active suicidal ideation ; patient meet DSMV criterion comorbid substance abuse disorder within last 12 month exclude . Other psychiatric comorbidities permit . Subjects meet psychiatric cardiac inclusion criterion also enrol study .</criteria>
