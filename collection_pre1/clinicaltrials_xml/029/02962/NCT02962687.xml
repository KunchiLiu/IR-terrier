	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Older adult complex care need constitute large rapidly expand group Veterans receive care within Veterans Health Administration ( VHA ) . Medically complex old Veterans , often multiple chronic condition ( MCC ) well interact functional psychosocial challenge , account disproportionate amount health care resource . Importantly , Veterans also experience disproportionate amount suffering ; bad functional status , high symptom burden , spend time acute care setting hospital emergency department . The investigator ' experience recent study suggest substantial proportion older medically complex Veterans unrecognized cognitive impairment ( CI ) , contribute disproportionate need care adverse outcomes . The Cumulative Complexity model posit complexity result accumulate interact clinical social factor contribute patient 's workload ( e.g . make appointment manage complicated medicine regimen ) well impact patient 's capacity perform everyday task include related health care . Imbalance two- i.e . workload exceed capacity-is primary driver disruption care negative outcome . Older patient MCC , high health care utilization , CI often find perfect storm complexity , simultaneously experience escalate workload demand set reduced capacity . OBJECTIVES The primary objective pilot study : Examine feasibility acceptability 12-week care management program medically complex Veterans CI , deliver via telephone video visit . - Feasibility examine calculate overall rate eligibility enrollment , well rate attrition , adherence nurse call video visit , interview completion . - Acceptability assess use in-depth interview study participant ( Veterans Care Partners ) , primary care provider , study staff . Assess usability perceive value video-enhanced care management , compare telephone-based , among old Veterans medical complexity CI . - Usability video-enhanced program examine use System Usability Scale ( SUS ) . - Perceived value associate delivery method explore questionnaire in-depth interview study participant study staff . METHODS Veterans age 65 old high medical complexity base Care Assessment Need ( CAN ) score screen CI use reliable valid instrument develop use telephone . Veterans CI , self-identified Care Partner , participate nurse-led care management program design provide structure cognitively-appropriate information support two key area : ( 1 ) care coordination ( reduce workload ) ( 2 ) protect cognitive health ( build capacity ) . Evidence-based strategy improve care coordination promote cognitive health enhance video visit allow improve communication nurse Veteran/Care Partner , facilitate expand assessment Veteran his/her home environment . Study measure include SUS , participant feedback , measure intervention effectiveness include health physical function ( PROMIS 29 ) , physical activity level ( PASE ) , depression ( PHQ-9 ) , anxiety ( GAD-7 ) , acute care day ( hospital ER ) . ANTICIPATED IMPACT Results preliminary study use inform development randomize clinical trial evaluate impact 12-month video-enhanced care management program medically complex old adult CI . Given large number medically complex Veterans affect unrecognized CI , essential intervention target population scalable , technology-enhanced intervention offer way expand reach new care model . Proactive recognition management medically complex patient high priority VHA , medically complex Veterans CI constitute one high risk group . The result study high relevance VHA , outside VA , give urgent need develop innovative mean improve care medically complex old adult .</detailed_description>
