	<brief_title>Transplantation Basal Cell Layer Suspension Using Derma-rolling System Vitiligo</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Condition : stable lesion non segmental segmental vitiligo adult . Background : The best method transepidermally deliver isolated cell ( melanocyte ) yet define . Microneedle treatment `` ex vivo `` human skin cause many thin vertical epidermodermal fissure variable depth injury dermis regard length needle . This kind treatment could able create small epidermal defect allow deliver melanocyte epidermal site . An approach replenish melanocyte injection dissociate epidermal cell suspension syringe recently successfully use . So , hypothesize use dermaroller 0.2mm needle length cause tiny microinjuries strictly epidermis could offer simple , minimally invasive painless method melanocyte transplantation . Main objective : To demonstrate efficacy interest dermaroller use 0.2mm needle length transplantation basal cell layer suspension epidermis depigmented vitiligo skin . Secondary objective 1 . To assess control effect use dermaroller alone vitiligo lesion . 2 . If transplantation successful , assess duration need obtain good coalescence complete repigmentation vitiligo lesion .</detailed_description>
