	<brief_summary>Distal radius ( Colle 's ) fracture adult patient commonly reduce emergency department casting . Standard care currently require x-ray performed fracture reduction , inadequate reduction may subject repeat attempt high risk require surgery . This study ass use point-of-care ultrasound ( POCUS ) addition standard care tool decrease angulation fracture site reduction perform . If angulation decrease , would suggest POCUS distal radius fracture reduction could decrease number fail reduction attempt therefore number repeat reduction attempt .</brief_summary>
