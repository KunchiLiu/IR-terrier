	<detailed_description>This study explore feasibility idea use standard , FDA-approved patient monitor detect ventilatory depression play record nurse 's voice prompt patient name breathe . The voice prompt occur addition traditional alarm sound monitor . The study device consist commercially available physiologic monitor , speaker , laptop computer . The physiologic monitor include pulse oximeter motion sensor , capnometer , nasal airway pressure sensor ( build nasal cannula ) . Nasal pressure commonly use clinical monitor sleep apnea detection polysomnography test sleep lab . The study conduct patient admitted hospital follow surgery . Patients monitor first 24 hour surgery , first recovery room ( post anesthesia care unit , PACU ) hospital floor . The study enroll patient high likelihood experience ventilatory depression and/or partial complete airway obstruction . This patient group include know suspected obstructive sleep apnea surgery associate moderate severe postoperative pain require significant opioid administration surgery . The study compare effectiveness prompt patient breathe routine clinical practice PACU hospital floor . The hypothesis compare standard monitoring intervention clinical staff , digitize breath prompt prompt patient breathe quickly , lead high oxygen-hemoglobin saturation respiratory rate throughout first 24 hour patient 's hospital stay follow surgery . For patient safety purpose , experimental design study implement device shadow monitor . Patients instrumented standard physiologic monitor per routine practice hospital location ( PACU floor ) . There change clinical staff interact patient ( i.e . prompt breathe , check vital sign , administer medication , assess patient well-being , etc . ) Clinical staff may disable device time patient comfort safety question . This study involve use already clear medical device use accordance indication clear label . What unique output monitoring device use prompt patient directly name breathe . The goal study test feasibility idea patient respond prompt breathe digitize prompt system . If concept successful patient surgery , healthy volunteer previous test , future research step would include design device test clinical trial patient general floor .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients meet follow criterion invite participate study : 1 . Patients undergo surgical procedure associate post operative hospital stay least 24 hour . 2 . Patients know suspected obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) . Known OSA define sleep hypopnea study within last 10 year consistent OSA . Suspected OSA define patient screening questionnaire ( STOPBang ) score 58 ( A score consistent high risk OSA ) . The STOPBang questionnaire build component anesthesia preopreative evaluation EPIC . OR 3 . Patients undergo surgical procedure associate significant post operative pain require opioid analgesic manage pain . Sample procedure include major extremity surgery , spine surgery , abdominal surgery , chest surgery require post operative patient hospital stay . Nurses meet follow criterion invite participate study : PACU nurse charge care consented patient . 1 . Patients discharge home day surgery . 2 . Vulnerable population include pregnant woman , prisoner , people require legally authorize representative consent 3 . There exclusion criterion PACU Nurses</criteria>
