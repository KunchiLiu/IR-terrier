	<brief_summary>This two arm Phase I study within Pacific Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Consortium ( PNOC ) . This study look determine safety recommend phase 2 dose modify measles virus ( MV-NIS ) child young adult recurrent medulloblastoma atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor ( ATRT ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Modified Measles Virus ( MV-NIS ) Children Young Adults With Recurrent Medulloblastoma Recurrent ATRT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open label , multi-center , Phase I study assess safety administer MV-NIS directly tumor bed ( locally recurrent medulloblastoma ATRT patient ) subarachnoid space ( disseminated recurrent medulloblastoma ATRT patient ) . For locally recurrent patient , MV-NIS directly administer tumor bed follow standard care surgical resection . For patient disseminated recurrence , MV-NIS inject via lumbar puncture ( LP ) . This one-time administration either locally disseminate recurrence . Patients closely monitor 30 day injection , follow evaluation 6 month progressive free survival overall response rate .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>For stratum A , patient must local recurrent disease ( define negative spine MRI negative cytology within 21 day prior study registration ) undergo resection local recurrence part standard care . Children must undergo consider standard care upfront therapy include either surgery follow high dose chemotherapy stem cell rescue multimodality therapy surgery , radiation chemotherapy . For stratum B , patient must disseminate recurrent disease ( defined multifocal disease , positive spine MRI include leptomeningeal disease and/or positive cytology within 21 day prior study registration ) adequate cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) flow base spine MRI evidence bulky disease bulky disease present base CSF flow study per institutional guideline . Children must undergo consider standard care upfront therapy include either surgery follow high dose chemotherapy stem cell rescue multimodality therapy surgery , radiation chemotherapy . Prior Therapy : The patient must fail least one prior therapy surgery follow high dose chemotherapy stem cell rescue multimodality therapy surgery , radiation chemotherapy prior study registration . Patients must fully recover acute toxic effect prior chemotherapy , immunotherapy , radiotherapy prior enter study . Myelosuppressive chemotherapy : Patients must receive last dose know myelosuppressive anticancer chemotherapy least three week prior study registration least six week prior nitrosourea . Biologic agent : Patient must recover toxicity potentially related agent receive last dose biologic agent ≥ 7 day prior study registration . For agent know adverse event occur beyond 7 day administration , period must extend beyond time adverse event know occur . The duration interval discuss study chair . For biologic agent prolonged halflife , appropriate interval since last treatment discuss Study Chair prior registration . Monoclonal antibody treatment : At least three halflives must elapse prior registration . Such patient discuss study chair prior registration . For bevacizumab , patient must receive last dose ≥ 32 day prior study registration . Bone Marrow Transplant : Patient must : ≥ 6 month since allogeneic bone marrow transplant prior registration ≥ 3 month since autologous bone marrow/stem cell prior registration Radiation : Patients must : Had last fraction local irradiation primary tumor ≥12 week prior registration Had last fraction craniospinal irradiation total body irradiation ≥ 12 week prior registration • Age ≥ 12 month less equal 39 year age • Karnofsky ≥ 50 patient ≥ 16 year age , Lansky ≥ 50 patient &lt; 16 year age ( See Appendix A ) . Patients unable walk paralysis , wheelchair , consider ambulatory purpose assess performance score . Patients preexist neurological deficit need stable prior surgery LP determine investigator . Antimeasles virus immunity demonstrate IgG antimeasles antibody per institutional guideline ( within 21 day prior study registration ) . Organ Function Requirements ( within 7 day prior study registration ) Adequate Bone Marrow Function Defined : Peripheral absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1000/mm3 Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3 ( transfusion independent , define receive platelet transfusion least 7 day prior enrollment ) . Adequate Renal Function Defined : Creatinine clearance radioisotope glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) great equal 70mL/min/1.73 m2 A serum creatinine base age/gender follow : Age Maximum Serum Creatinine ( mg/dL ) Male Female 1 . 2 year 0.6 0.6 2. &lt; 6 year 0.8 0.8 6 &lt; 10 year 1 1 10 &lt; 13 year 1.2 1.2 13 &lt; 16 year 1.5 1.4 16 year 1.7 1.4 The threshold creatinine value table derive Schwartz formula estimate GFR utilize child length stature data publish CDC . Adequate Liver Function Defined : Bilirubin ( sum conjugate + unconjugated ) less equal 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) age SGPT ( ALT ) less equal 110 U/L . Serum albumin less equal 2 g/dL . • The effect MVNIS develop human fetus unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry , duration study participation 4 month completion MVNIS administration . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . • Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Exclusion Criteria Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy within 3 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier Patients receive investigational agent History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition measles virus vaccination Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement Female patient childbearing potential must pregnant breastfeeding . Female patient childbearing potential must negative serum urine pregnancy test ( within 7 day prior study registration ) HIVpositive patient Patients low CD4 count ( &lt; 200/µL 14 % total lymphocyte count ) Patients inability return followup visit obtain followup study require assess toxicity therapy Exposure household contact know immunodeficiency Allergy measles vaccine history severe reaction prior measles vaccination History chronic hepatitis B C infection History organ transplantation Patients evidence extraneural disease Patients chronic steroid use immunosuppressive agent</criteria>
