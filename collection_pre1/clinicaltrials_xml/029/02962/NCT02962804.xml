	<brief_summary>There two primary aim study : 1 ) determine tolerability feasibility combination hypofractionated radiation therapy PD-1 inhibition nivolumab , 2 ) determine ability hypofractionated radiation therapy enhance response rate PD-1 inhibition versus PD-1 inhibition alone compare observe response rate combination therapy previously report response rate inhibition alone .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients metastatic recurrent renal cell cancer progress standard Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor ( TKI ) therapy metastatic primary tumor suitable palliative radiation eligible study . Treatment consist nivolumab plus hypofractionated radiation therapy . The primary endpoint objective response rate , compare historical control 25 % use nivolumab alone establish CHECKMATE 025 clinical trial . Patients continue nivolumab disease progression withdrawal consent . Follow-up continue 2 year .</detailed_description>
