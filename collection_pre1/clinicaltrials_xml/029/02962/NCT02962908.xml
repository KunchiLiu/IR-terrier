	<brief_summary>FLU-v vaccine aim protect wide range flu virus . The purpose study measure immune response induce FLU-v vaccine . This study look safe FLU-v administer successful preventing flu reduce severity flu symptom . The study require 222 healthy volunteer 18-60 year old . Participation study take maximum 7 month consist 5 visit . During visit 1 , subject examine doctor make sure eligible enter study . A 15ml blood sample ( tablespoon ) take check general health follow general physical exam . Medical history personal information collect . Subjects receive traditional flu vaccine past 6 month , female pregnant breastfeed allow study . Subjects childbearing age must agree use effective contraceptive method . At visit 2 , subject randomly allocate one four treatment group summarise : - Treatment 1 : FLU-v ( test vaccine ) start study ( Day 0 ) 21 day later - Treatment 2 : FLU-v ( test vaccine ) additional substance add [ know Montanide ISA 51 ] improves effect test vaccine . Injection give Day 0 Placebo ( test vaccine ) alone 21 day later - Treatment 3 : Placebo ( test vaccine ) injection Day 0 21 day later - Treatment 4 : Placebo ( test vaccine ) additional substance add [ know Montanide ISA 51 ] Day 0 Placebo ( test vaccine ) alone 21 day later Treatment inject skin upper arm day 0 ( visit 2 ) 21 day later ( visit 3 ) . Blood sample take treatment ( day 0 ) , day 42 ( visit 4 ) 180 ( visit 5 ) immune response induce vaccine . Subjects ask complete diary card write side effect may experience vaccination . Subjects also ask complete another diary card document flu-like symptom experience December 2016 March 2017 , time officially consider flu season . During period , subject experience flu-like symptom , collection nose tonsil swab arrange study site confirm whether flu .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomised , Double-blind , Placebo-controlled Phase IIb Trial Test FLU-v Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Current seasonal influenza vaccine mainly induce immune response viral membrane glycoprotein . These protein , however , undergo continuous mutation process call antigenic drift . To prevent immune escape , annual vaccination late predicted viral strain adopt . Such vaccination strategy pose inconvenience cost-inefficiency , also result poor protective effectiveness vaccinate strain mismatch actual circulating strain . The latter point especially concern pandemic outbreak , large geographical area affect general population naïve newly re-assorted viral strain due antigenic shift . Objective : To evaluate safety immunogenicity influenza vaccine ( FLU-v , suspension adjuvanted emulsion ) target conserve immunogenic region influenza A B viruses healthy adult , particular show TH1 cytokine response 42 180 day first injection great adjuvanted FLU-v unadjuvanted FLU-v placebo . Study design : A total 222 study participant recruit . The study follow factorial design two factor treatment ( FLU-v / placebo ) formulation ( unadjuvanted / suspension , adjuvanted / emulsion ) . Subjects randomise two stratum ( age 18 40 , age 41 60 ) one follow treatment regimen : - Group 1 ( n=74 ) : FLU-v ( unadjuvanted ) suspension pH neutral HCl/NaOH ( 0.5mL ) Day 0 Day 21 - Group 2 ( n=74 ) : ( 0.5mL ) ISA-51-adjuvanted FLU-v emulsified water injection ( WFI ) Day 0 , saline ( 0.5mL ) Day 21 - Group 3 ( n=37 ) : saline solution ( 0.5mL ) Day 0 Day 21 - Group 4 ( n=37 ) : WFI ISA-51 emulsion ( 0.5mL ) Day 0 , saline ( 0.5mL ) Day 21 Each administration give subcutaneously . Solicited unsolicited adverse event ( AEs ) collect AE questionnaire/diary card day 42 . Adverse event ( AEs ) serious adverse event ( SAEs ) collect entire study period . The treatment administer start third quarter 2016 order provide protection subsequent influenza season start December 2016 . Blood sample take subject day 0 ( FLU-v vaccination ) , 42 ( 21 day second dose ) 180 ( 159 day second dose ) evaluation FLU-v-specific cellular humoral immune response . Clinical symptom score ascertain severity incidence RT-PCR-confirmed influenza A and/or B infection record subsequent influenza season ( December 2016 March 2017 ) decide clinical efficacy test vaccine . Study population : Healthy volunteer age 18-60 year . Intervention : FLU-v investigational influenza vaccine lyophilise product contain 500 microgram total peptide reconstitute either 0.01M HCl ( 0.25ml ) 0.01M NaOH ( 0.25ml ) achieve volume 0.5ml , emulsify WFI ( water injection , 0.25ml ) ISA-51 ( 0.25ml ) achieve volume 0.5ml . Primary study parameters/endpoints : For immunogenicity : To compare change baseline ( Day 0 ) treatment cellular immune response , specifically TH1 cytokine , group 42 180 day follow FLU-v vaccination . For safety : ( 1 ) To evaluate solicit AEs subject 21 day last dosing study vaccine ( FLU-v ) ; ( 2 ) To evaluate unsolicited AEs SAEs subject entire study period first dose FLU-v . Secondary study parameters/endpoints : To evaluate humoral immune response specific FLU-v TH2 cytokine baseline group 42 180 day follow FLU-v vaccination . Exploratory study parameters/endpoints : For immunogenicity : To evaluate change baseline cellular immune response base additional CMI assay ELISPOT ( Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSpot ) group 42 180 day follow FLU-v vaccination , subset subject choose random . Clinical efficacy : ( 1 ) To evaluate efficacy FLU-v vaccine reduce incidence RT-PCR confirm influenza A and/or B infection subject influenza season 2016-2017 . ( 2 ) To evaluate efficacy FLU-v vaccine reduction symptom score among RT-PCR confirm influenza A and/or B infection case influenza season 2016-2017 . The relationship efficacy cellular humoral response explore possible . The effect previous influenza vaccination immunogenicity FLU-v assess post-hoc exploratory analysis stratification data base exposure influenza vaccine previous 24 month . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : The intended application IMP prophylactic vaccine prevent influenza virus infection induce enhance influenza-specific immune response . The FLU-v vaccine design deliver either naturally particulate suspension ( i.e . adjuvant ) emulsify adjuvant . Particulate emulsify protein preparation preferentially take phagocytic cell ( e.g . dendritic cell ) responsible induce primary immune response . Treatment FLU-v four dose 263 μg/occasion two dose 553 μg/occasion , without adjuvant , well tolerate animal sign systemic toxicity . In pre-clinical study , subcutaneous administration ISA 51 result systemic toxicity . At injection site occasionally adjacent tissue inject material remain surrounded mild chronic inflammatory response . As IMP provide one presentation ( 500 μg combine peptide ) lyophilize form suspension seal single-use vial , overdose highly unlikely . In single centre , randomise , double blind phase I study safety , tolerability immunogenicity FLU-v safety tolerability concern identify dos administer ( 250 μg 500 μg FLU-v ) subject clinical study safety tolerability concern identify follow administration adjuvant subject ( 1 ) . FLU-v vaccine candidate demonstrate immunogenic human , measure ex vivo γ-interferon production ( 1 ) . Clinical experience Montanide ISA 51 date back 1990s trial related cancer Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ( AIDS ) . Currently , cancer trial melanoma , colorectal , prostate , cervical , brain cancer leukemia ongoing . Frequency vaccination often 2 4 week , number injection reach 40 . Route immunization often subcutaneous volume injection reach 3mL . Most common local reaction local pain , tenderness , erythema granuloma injection site . Less frequently , mild moderate transient induration swell described . General reaction mainly 'flu-like symptom chill , fever headache . Lethargy nausea also observe . The intensity usually mild moderate . No biological change generally observe . As Placebo vaccine provide seal single-use vial , overdose highly unlikely ( Influenza virus ( FLU-v ) vaccine Investigator 's Brochure , Edition 2.0 , 07 September 2015 ) .</detailed_description>
