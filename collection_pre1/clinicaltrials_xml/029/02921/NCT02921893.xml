	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study well ixazomib citrate , lenalidomide , dexamethasone work treat patient polyneuropathy , organomegaly , endocrinopathy , monoclonal gammopathy , skin change ( POEMS ) syndrome . Ixazomib citrate may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , lenalidomide dexamethasone , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving ixazomib citrate , lenalidomide , dexamethasone may work well treat patient POEMS syndrome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ixazomib Citrate , Lenalidomide , Dexamethasone Treating Patients With POEMS Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I. Normalization VEGF 3 cycle therapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Toxicity safety combination ixazomib citrate ( ixazomib ) , lenalidomide , dexamethasone . II . Hematologic response 3 cycle therapy . III . Hematologic response rate and/or VEGF response 12 month . IV . Overall survival . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Improvement peripheral neuropathy ( Overall Neuropathy Limitations Scale [ ONLS ] , Modified Neurological Impairment Score POEMS [ mNIS+7POEMS ] , performance score ) , ascites/effusions , diffuse capacity lung carbon monoxide ( DLCO ) 3 cycle therapy . II . Improvement peripheral neuropathy ( ONLS , mNIS+7POEMS , performance score ) , ascites/effusions , DLCO , positron emission tomography ( PET ) -scan ( abnormal baseline ) 12 month ( group ) 24 36 month ( group 2 ) . III . Time VEGF response , hematologic response , clinical response . IV . Time VEGF progression , hematologic progression , clinical progression . V. Doses deliver tabulated establish tolerance study drug . VI . To describe change bone biomarkers treatment ixazomib , lenalidomide , dexamethasone . OUTLINE : Patients assign 1 2 group . GROUP I : Patients receive ixazomib citrate orally ( PO ) day 1 , 8 , 15 , lenalidomide PO daily ( QD ) day 1-21 , dexamethasone PO day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo standard care autologous stem cell transplant ( ASCT ) complete 3 course treatment . GROUP II : Patients receive ixazomib citrate PO , lenalidomide PO QD , dexamethasone PO Group I . Treatment repeat every 28 day 13 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month every 6 month 36 month .</detailed_description>
