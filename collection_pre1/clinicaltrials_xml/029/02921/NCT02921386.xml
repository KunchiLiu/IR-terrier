	<detailed_description>This Phase 2 , open-label , randomize , cross , pharmacokinetic study . Subjects initially dose 2 week ( Run-In Phase ) allow suppression endogenous testosterone production , allow oral TU reach steady state . The subject confine clinical unit undergo PK Phase study . During PK Phase study , subject undergo five-period cross-over oral TU dose twice daily . Subjects dose morning evening immediately prior protocol-defined meal . The protocol-defined breakfast contain various level fat include 15 g , 30 g , 45 g , breakfast consistent fat calorie content high-fat breakfast consistent recommendation Guidance Industry Food-Effect Bioavailability Fed Bioequivalence Studies ( December 2002 ) , fast ( meal 4 hour post-dose ) . Subjects randomize designated sequence protocol-defined breakfast , fast state . The subject require consume entire breakfast within 20 minute PK Phase . The protocol-defined evening meal require consume within 20 minute . The 5 meal period occur sequential day . Approximately twenty ( 20 ) subject enrol order ensure completion 16 subject .</detailed_description>
