	<brief_title>Trial Comparing ELUVIA Versus Bare Metal Stent Treatment Superficial Femoral and/or Proximal Popliteal Artery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The EMINENT study prospective , multi-center study confirm superior effectiveness ELUVIA stent versus Self-Expanding Bare Nitinol Stents treatment lesion 30-140 mm long locate femoropopliteal artery subject symptom classify Rutherford categories 2-4 . The study 2:1 randomize ( ELUVIA vs Self-Expanding Bare Nitinol Stents ) , control , single-blind , superiority trial ( RCT ) . The objective study confirm superior effectiveness ELUVIA Drug-Eluting Vascular Stent System ( ELUVIA Stent ) treat Superficial Femoral Artery ( SFA ) and/or Proximal Popliteal Artery ( PPA ) lesions 140 mm length compare bare metal stent , collect additional data include health economics data .</detailed_description>
