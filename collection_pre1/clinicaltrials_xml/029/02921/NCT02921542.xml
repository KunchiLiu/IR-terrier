	<detailed_description>Purpose : To evaluate vessel lumen quality ( gain ) patient outcome base treatment predetermine laser treatment protocol patient present vary lesion type morphology : homogenous ( plaque uniform texture-smooth regular ) , heterogeneous ( plaques non-uniform texture-smooth irregular surface ) , calcific ( consist calcium ) restenotic ( reoccurring narrow vessel follow prior treatment ) associate peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) . Participants : 60 patient PAD undergo revascularization procedure ( treatment narrow blood vessel ) involve knee ( ATK ) lesion ( ) eligible treatment laser atherectomy ( option treatment block blood vessel . ) Procedures ( method ) : Patients ' qualify lesion assess angiography ( test use special dye camera take picture blood flow artery ) intravascular ultrasound ( IVUS ) categorize ( homogenous , heterogeneous , calcific restenotic ) determine treatable laser atherectomy per standard care . Qualified patient undergo standard care treatment Spectranetics Turbo-Power laser catheter three pass increase setting 'low ' ( 40/60 ) , 'medium ' ( 50/40 ) 'high ' ( 60/60 ) , respectively . After pas , assessment lumen quality residual stenosis ( narrow still present treatment ) determine angiogram IVUS . The operator may finish procedure per standard care/investigator discretion protocol define laser pass complete .</detailed_description>
