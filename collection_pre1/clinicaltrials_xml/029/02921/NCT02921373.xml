	<brief_summary>Cell-based therapy form stem cell-based immune cell-based therapy become important treatment option either approve clinical use show promise clinical trial . One issue regard cell-based therapy , cell inject subject , easy way track go , assess whether adequate number cell arrive intend therapeutic target long persist give location . To address issue non-invasive image method develop use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . When used appropriate cell label contrast agent , Cellular MRI track cell non-invasively vivo . Detection cell accomplish inert imaging agent contain MRI sensitive fluorine-19 ( 19F ) nucleus . The objective study demonstrate 19F-MRI safe use human subsequently use track cell-based immunotherapy future clinical trial . The long term goal able quantify immune cell migration secondary lymphoid tissue potentially tumor correlate therapeutic outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : None currently available Good Manufacturing Practices ( GMP ) -grade MRI cell label agent approve use Canada . There one iron oxide nanoparticle GMP grade preparation commercially available suitable label immune cell population investigator interested track vivo . The investigator , instead , choose develop commercially available , GMP-grade 19F-based perfluorocarbon , know Cell Sense , purpose track immune cell-based vaccine therapy vivo . This agent successful use phase I clinical trial United States approve second trial current recruiting , oversight FDA . The cell trace agent Cell Sense ( CS-1000 ) inert , non-metabolizable tracer . As CS-1000 taken-up incorporate cell traditional pharmacodynamic pharmacokinetic analysis animal human appropriate , adsorption biodistribution vary cell type , therefore do . In vitro study toxicity towards various cell type yield evidence adverse effect various cell function . Cell Sense also show non-mutagenic use Ames Forward thymidine kinase ( TK ) assay . Some limited skin irritation observe &gt; 2,500 fold Cell Sense expect maximally injected human inject intradermally rat . Examples MRI cell track label include superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles 19F-containing compound perfluorocarbon . The advantage use cellular MRI track cell non-radioactive tracer use suitable longitudinal study . MRI offer 3D image exquisite soft tissue contrast . The additional advantage use 19F iron-based agent 19F positive , easily quantifiable contrast cell label agent . Furthermore , 19F-background MRI signal human whereas MRI involve iron confound different imaging artifact negative contrast agent difficult accurately quantify . The investigator particularly interested whether immune cell arrive secondary lymphoid organ lymph node . Study Design : Open label , dose escalating , single centre , phase I study accrue ( ) 6 healthy adult ( b ) 6 prostate cancer patient . Three healthy adult three prostate cancer patient enrol first cohort . Whole blood ( 150 ml ) obtain venipuncture . After process blood obtain peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) , half PBMC treat Cell Sense 8-24 hour . Given robustness data use 5 donor dry run , investigator propose compare label v unlabeled cell release criterion . However , investigator collect data information research purpose . Three million ( 3 x 106 ) Cell Sense label autologous PBMC administer intradermally cohort 1 subject . The three healthy adult 3 prostate cancer subject test concurrently . If grade 2 high adverse event observe 1st cohort , concurrent enrolment proceed recruit second set 3 healthy adult subject second set 3 prostate cancer patient . The second cohort subject subject design escalation dose 2-3 x 107 Cell Sense-labeled autologous PBMC administer intradermally . Endpoints : Primary Endpoints : Determine feasibility use Cell Sense detect monitor migration PBMC human Secondary Endpoints : - Confirm optimize 19F Cell Sense detection Hydrogen- 1 ( 1H ) anatomical image parameter image use 19F/1H dual coil . - Determine Cell Sense-labeled PBMC migration drain lymph node detect . - Determine lymph node area interest image change size injected side compare contralateral side . - Quantify number Cell Sense-labeled PBMC detect . - Evaluate safety parameter ( toxicity ) define : - adverse event . - serious adverse event . - change laboratory determination vital sign parameter assess medical history , physical examination clinical laboratory test . The following category use grade adverse event : - Grade 1 : interfere daily activity , - Grade 2 : interferes daily activity , treatment require , except paracetamol , - Grade 3 : prevents daily activity require treatment . - Grade 4 : Life-threatening NIH FDA ( CTCAE v 4.0 ) guideline use determine severity adverse event</detailed_description>
