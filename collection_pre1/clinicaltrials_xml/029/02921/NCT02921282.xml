	<detailed_description>It know cannabinoid dopamine receptor important modulators response nicotine associate cue . In study participant genotyped determine whether relationship CB1 D3 gene reinforce property nicotine subjective effect nicotine-associated cue . In one session , participant choose two different cigarette , different property . In another session , physiological response crave measure presented cue remind participant nicotine . At point study , blood collect genotyping process study whether CB1 D3 genotype influence responses nicotine cue .</detailed_description>
