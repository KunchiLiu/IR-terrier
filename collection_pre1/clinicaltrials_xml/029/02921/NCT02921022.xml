	<brief_summary>The purpose study test good bad effect study drug call PEGPH20 . PEGPH20 alone consider investigational . The Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve market sale PEGPH20 , authorize use research study human . PEGPH20 could shrink cancer also cause side effect . PEGPH20 enzyme break specific tissue component call hyaluronan produce tumor . Pancreatic tumor often large amount hyaluronan . The removal hyaluronan tumor may decrease tumor growth .</brief_summary>
