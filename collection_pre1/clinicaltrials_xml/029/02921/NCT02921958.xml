	<brief_title>The Life Participation Parents Outcome Measure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction Purpose : The Life Participation Parents assessment tool design measure parent 's ability participate daily life raise child special need . Previous study establish effectiveness instrument provide valuable information design family-centered goal intervention . Further investigation need determine instrument sensitive enough measure change intervention . This study design develop LPP assessment provide family-centered intervention child special needs family investigate child characteristic lead issue parental participation . Background : Parents raise child special need encounter many challenge daily life . However , initial study use LPP determine challenge predict age , gender , diagnose child , time child therapy , age , gender , marital status parent . These challenge unique individual therefore instrument need assess individual parental need facilitate family-centered intervention.Family-centered practice pediatric occupational therapy involve work parent , family , child special need facilitate participation life engagement occupation . Occupational therapy practitioner frequently interpret family-centered practice parental involvement establish facilitate child- related goal . However , family-centered practice go beyond child-related goal incorporate change quality life whole family . Families interdependent , intervention child significant impact life participation entire family , especially parent . Raising child special need influence parent 's time usage , health , choice activity . To provide best-practice family-centered intervention , therapist need understand individual barrier life participation child , parent , family member . The LPP 22 item self-report questionnaire use 5 point Likert scale . Each item also space qualitative comment regard response . It design used clinical practitioner occupational therapist , physical therapist , speech language pathologist determine issue parent participate daily life . The issue identify LPP initiate conversation parent clinician assist develop family-centered intervention goal . The LPP develop use Occupational Adaptation frame reference provide item efficiency effectiveness parent 's ability participate life activity effect raise child special need . A preliminary principle component analysis reveal evidence two subscales . The LPP take approximately10 minute complete parent score easily therapist . Two questionnaire ( Infant Toddler Sensory Profile Child Behavior Checklist ) use investigate impact child behavior parent participation . Occupational therapist treat numerous young child sensory processing abnormality due developmental delay . Sensory process commonly understood mean process brain receives make use form ( tactile , auditory , visual etc . ) sensation generate behavioral response environment . Research show 45 % 96 % child Autism Spectrum Disorders ( ASDs ) developmental disorder present sensory abnormality , sensory-related behavior often drive referral occupational therapy . The majority research area focus school-age child ASDs . The parent child identify increase level stress disruption family life participation routine result . Since family member interdependent , member 's ability participate occupation affect health health others . There virtually research sensory abnormality sensory-driven behavior young child ( 0-3 years-old ) affect parent participation occupation . This critical factor occupational therapy intervention young child families.3 . Summary Project : The propose study use pretest - intervention - posttest longitudinal design assess sensitivity LPP measure change . A previous study establish response LPP static short term ( 2-3 week ) focus intervention pretest posttest ( Fingerhut , 2013 ) . At pretest , parent participant child age 3 also ask complete Infant Toddler Sensory Profile ( ITSP ) Child Behavior Checklist ( CBCL ) . This information correlate parent participation LPP investigate effect child characteristic parent participation.4 . Study Procedures : Occupational therapist participant recruit pediatric occupational therapy clinic early intervention program throughout Texas . Occupational Therapists ( OTs ) ( n=30 ) approach investigator ask 2 parent current client complete LPP ( n=60 ) . If parent identify issue therapist believe would amenable family-centered intervention 3 month time frame parent enrol longitudinal study . If therapist continue recruit enroll 2 parent . Parents child age 3 also ask complete ITSP CBCL initial stage . This information use investigate effect measure child characteristic parental participation . The parent child age 3 may also enrol longitudinal aspect study depend issue describe LPP . Parents child age 3 continue recruit 50 participants.For parent recruit longitudinal aspect study , therapist use information LPP explore response parent collaboratively establish one family-centered goal related item item LPP . The therapist design intervention address goal addition establish intervention provide child family . The study researcher provide information family-centered intervention , training , strategy assist therapist provide effective family-centered intervention.Intervention provide three month child 's therapy discontinue . At point ( 3 month discontinuation ) , parent complete LPP . The therapist complete short survey include goal establish , intervention provide , observe outcome intervention . Therapists also interview regard experience use LPP facilitate family-centered intervention . Data Analysis/ Study Questions1 . Is significant positive change overall LPP score parent participant whose intervention outcome describe positive therapist ? ( Wilcoxon sign rank test ) . 2 . Is significant positive change LPP Items closely related establish goal parent participant whose intervention outcome describe positive therapist ? ( Wilcoxon sign rank test ) .3 . Do level sensory processing measure Infant Toddler Sensory Profile ( ITSP ) correlate parent participation measure LPP ? 4 . Do level maladaptive behavior , measure Child Behavior Checklist ( CBCL ) correlate level parent participation measure LPP ? 5 . Does pattern sensory presentation measure ITSP correlate maladaptive behavior measure CBCL ? Study data ( demographic data ) LPP completion ( pretest longitudinal study ) add data previous study ( n= 162 + 60plus ) confirmatory principle component analysis ( oblique rotation ) .</detailed_description>
