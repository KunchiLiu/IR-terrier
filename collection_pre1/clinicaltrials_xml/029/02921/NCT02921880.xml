	<brief_title>Does Cardiac REhabilitation Improve Functional , Independence , Frailty Emotional outCOmes Following Trans Catheter Aortic ValvE Replacement ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Aortic stenosis common form valvular heart disease elderly associate high morbidity mortality cardiac symptom develop ( 1 ) . In patient high risk serious complication surgery , Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation ( TAVI ) show result reduction mortality improvement quality life compare medical therapy ( 2 , 3 ) . Due age increasingly complex nature patient aortic stenosis , frailty functional assessment become high-priority theme within patient management . Frailty term widely use describe multidimensional syndrome loss reserve ( energy , physical ability , cognition , health ) give rise vulnerability . Several publication deal impact frailty mortality morbidity elderly population . Functional status evaluate ability undertake Activities Daily Living ( ADL ) demonstrate frailty onset dependence ADL strongly associate . 4.2 PRE-CLINICAL DATA/CLINICAL DATA Cardiac rehabilitation complex intervention offer patient heart disease include component health education , advice cardiovascular risk reduction , physical activity stress management . Cardiac rehabilitation physical activity recommend treatment cardiac valve surgery positively improve morbidity , exercise capacity quality life emotional well-being . The National Institute Healthcare Excellence The Department Health wider European guideline agree patient receive heart valve replacement benefit cardiac rehabilitation . 4.3 STUDY RATIONALE AND RISK/BENEFIT ANALYSIS A literature search reveal publication specifically outline impact receive programme cardiac rehabilitation , follow TAVR study aim address question . The ethical dilemma conduct research elderly patient undergone TAVR associate clinical trial elderly population . The dilemma consist need develop new well treatment option particular group patient whilst protect patient harm . We anticipate study allow u understand feasibility undertaking study group patient agree participate research study prior TAVR procedure . The pilot study help u understand logistics provide cardiac rehabilitation programme patient data generate allow u understand benefit relate functional , independence , frailty emotional domain patient group . The outcome pilot study may allow u plan future study aim develop appropriate guideline relate provision cardiac rehabilitation patient group . 4.4 MANAGEMENT OF POTENTIAL STUDY RISKS Patients eligible TAVR , determine multi-disciplinary team , see out-patient clinic in-patient area Research Nurse Manager delegate research nurse . Full inform consent obtain research intervention undertaken . Functional , independence , frailty emotional assessment include 6 minute walk teat , 4m gait speed walk , hand grip strength , questionnaires cognitive assessment . Patients undergo TAVR per routine practice discharge safe . The research nurse team collect clinical data admission . All patient attend clinic review 4 week post implant , research consent reaffirm patient randomised receive cardiac rehabilitation programme standard care . A personalised programme cardiac rehabilitation develop expert physiotherapist . Patients cardiac rehab group assess cardiac rehabilitation prior intervention take place . Patients monitor exercise full emergency equipment available emergency . Patients standard care group access TAVR nurse specialist well designate Consultant research nurse team ask advice time .</detailed_description>
