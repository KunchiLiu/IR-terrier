	<brief_title>Florida Cardiovascular Quality Network</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Florida Cardiovascular Quality Network ( FCQN ) quality outcome registry . In diverse group clinical site Florida , large number patient know possible stable ischemic cardiovascular disease ( SIHD ) refer cardiovascular stress test enrol quality demonstration registry . This registry base hypothesis evidence-based clinical guideline appropriate use criterion ( AUC ) , provide site time care ( point care ) , may improve physician clinical decision , thus , overall quality value care individual patient population . Specifically , study registry utilize multiple proven software tool point care : ( 1 ) Seattle Angina Questionnaire ( SAQ ) method measurement patient angina symptom ; ( 2 ) FOCUS , American College Cardiology ( ACC ) software provide clinical decision support ( CDS ) primary method determination AUC patient clinical indication cardiovascular stress test ; ( 3 ) CATH/PCI , ACC / National Cardiovascular Data Registry ( NCDR ) provide clinical decision support primary method determination AUC cardiac catheterization laboratory ; ( 4 ) PINNACLE , ACC/NCDR clinical registry provide extensive database clinical quality metric ; ( 5 ) ACC CARDIOSMART software module primary patient education tool effective risk factor modification . The application clinically proven software tool , apply point patient care , may assist physician compliance ACC guideline base AUC may directly result increase SIHD patient treat guideline direct medical treatment well guideline direct interventional treatment . It anticipate increased compliance ACC guideline AUC may directly correlate improved patient clinical outcome .</detailed_description>
