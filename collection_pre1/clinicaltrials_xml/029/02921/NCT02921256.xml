	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well veliparib work combination chemotherapy radiation therapy treat patient rectal cancer spread start nearby tissue lymph node ( locally advance ) . Veliparib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , modify ( ) FOLFOX6 regimen , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell shrink tumor . Giving veliparib combination chemotherapy radiation therapy may kill tumor cell give surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Veliparib Combination Chemotherapy Treating Patient With Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To demonstrate absolute improvement neoadjuvant rectal cancer ( NAR ) score experimental regimen compare control . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare overall survival ( OS ) . II . To compare disease-free survival ( DFS ) . III . To estimate rate disease progression chemotherapy ( prior chemoradiation ) . IV . To compare rate pathologic complete response ( nodes tumor ) . V. To compare rate clinical complete response rate ( cCR ) . VI . To compare rate negative circumferential margin . VII . To compare rate completion cycle neoadjuvant chemotherapy . VIII . To compare rate completion full course chemoradiation . IX . To compare rate sphincter preservation . X . To compare toxicity safety intervention . XI . To explore correlative molecular predictor response distant failure . XII . To explore relationship radiographic finding pathologic outcome . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive mFOLFOX6 regimen consist oxaliplatin intravenously ( IV ) 2 hour , leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour day 1 , fluorouracil IV continuously 46-48 hour day 1-2 . Treatment repeat every 2 week 8 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . 3-4 week last mFOLFOX6 patient undergo radiation therapy receive capecitabine orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) Monday-Friday 5 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive mFOLFOX6 regimen consist oxaliplatin IV 2 hour , leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour day 1 , fluorouracil IV continuously 46-48 hour day 1-2 . Treatment repeat every 2 week 8 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . 3-4 week last mFOLFOX6 patient undergo radiation therapy receive capecitabine PO BID veliparib PO BID Monday-Friday 5 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
