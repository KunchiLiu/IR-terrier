	<brief_summary>The present study design open label study patient mild cognitive impairment dementia evaluate long term tolerability potential efficacy tyrosine kinase inhibitor . Baseline outcome measure study utilize validated test appropriate repeat measure affect practice effect . Advantages study include fact neuropsychological test instrument advance MRI image protocol routine clinical deployment provide high degree availability reliability diagnosis monitoring change status . Quality assurance tightly control . The study population sufficiently broad condition interest sufficiently prevalent recruitment project number subject limit factor . For Phase I trial propose 20 patient sample determine frequency common side effect population study . Subjects administer initial dose bosutinib , dosage progressively increase course study . The initial dose bosutinib 100 mg tablet , per day . The dose increase tolerated 300 mg per day . All subject start 100 mg/day dose increase 100 mg month lower dose tolerate without significant side effect . That say , subject take 100 mg/day every day first month , 200 mg/day every day second month , 300 mg/day every day third month remainder study , provide adverse reaction prohibit continuation dosage . The investigator use Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) Version 4.0 monitor , evaluate , report adverse reaction ongoing basis . Stopping dose reduction rule report adverse reaction take package insert bosutinib .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In order subject consider study , follow criterion require : â€¢ Cognitive decline mild cognitive impairment ( Clinical Dementia Rating Stage 0.5 ) moderate dementia ( CDR Stages 1 2 ) All patient , accord routine best practice evaluation include neurological interview examination screen reversible cause cognitive change depression , substance abuse , vitamin deficiency systemic illness . All patient Beck Depression scale blood test B12 thyroid hormone . Patients EKG , particular screen QT prolongation relative counterindication use tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy . According package insert bosutinib , investigator propose use age range dosage route comparable overlap routine application drug . In addition , investigator propose dosage range substantially low usually recommend treatment leukemia . The QDRS scale give patient ; cut score 1.5 use qualify patient dementia score ( CDR ) 0.5 ( ref 19 ) . All patient lumbar puncture ABeta 42 Tau proteins Alzheimer 's Spectrum . This spinal fluid examination show sensitive specific Alzheimer 's disease ( ref 20 ) . Cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) tau level also elevate alpha synucleinopathy frontotemporal lobar degeneration ( ref 21 ) . The lumbar puncture perform entry . All patient advance MRI brain include volume measurement hippocampus ( ref 22 ) , arterial spin labeling ( ASL ) perfusion scan ( ref 23 ) MRS prefrontal , precuneus , hippocampus occipital lobe . Patients cognitive decline decrease perfusion temporal parietal frontal region brain ASL perfusion , show characteristic change MRS volumetric evaluation compare age match control subject . MRI also demonstrate patient tumor , hydrocephalus , subdural hematoma structural etiology cognitive decline . On entry , patient CDR stage least 0.5 least one abnormal image biomarker none exclusion criterion . Baseline , six month , twelve month , eighteen month two year ( completion ) test include Quick Dementia Rating System ( QDRS ) stag follow battery test : - Repeatable Battery Assessment Neuropsychological Status ( RBANS ) , - Standardized 25 foot time gait test - Nine Hole Pegboard Test , - Montreal Cognitive Assessment Test version 1,2,3 ( MOCA ) , - Brain imaging repeat one year two year . CSF study demonstrate good sensitivity specificity mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) dementia Alzheimer 's type ( ref 5 ) . MRI volumetrics , perfusion scan magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) show excellent discriminate value among Alzheimer 's dementia ( AD ) , Parkinson 's spectrum degeneration ( PDD/DLB ) frontal temporal lobar degeneration ( FTLD ) subgroups responsive change patient 's progress MCI dementia ( ref 6 ) . The rationale behind criterion support importance subject cognitively able effectively speak , listen , read English , cognitive capacity give inform consent . All subject start 100 mg/day dose increase 100 mg month lower dose tolerate without significant side effect . Adverse reaction scale accord CTCAE v.4 . If subject experience severe adverse reaction dose , subject require dose reduction toxicity dose 100 mg/day , subject remove study . If subject experience moderate adverse reaction dose &gt; 100 mg/day , dose reduce 100 mg maintain low dose 1 month . If subject experience moderate severe adverse reaction low dose , subject remove study . After 1 month , dose increase 100 mg . If subject experience adverse reaction elevate dose , he/she resume original up-titration schedule ( i.e . increase 100 mg every month 300 mg/day ) . If subject experience moderate symptom elevate dose , dose reduce 100 mg maintain low dose maximally tolerate dose . The duration treatment 1 year . To minimize risk , subject see weekly toxicity monitoring first month treatment , biweekly second month treatment . On week subject visit , subject status assess basis phone call respective care taker . The care taker determine QDRS stag time initial consultation . The care taker individual intimately familiar close contact subject . After first two month , visit monthly basis . Mild , moderate , severe adverse reaction report ongoing basis . The rationale extend administration allow reliable assessment tolerability . The primary endpoint evaluate tolerability many initial 20 subject discontinue due adverse reaction . Subjects discontinue moderate severe adverse reaction rating accord CTCAE , remediable dosage reduction .</detailed_description>
