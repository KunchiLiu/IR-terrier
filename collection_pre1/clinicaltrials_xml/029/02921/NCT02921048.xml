	<brief_title>Effects Omega-3 Fatty Acids Ambient Air Pollution Exposure Healthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose : To examine relationship blood level dietary eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) cardiopulmonary response environmental air pollution healthy adult . EPA DHA two important omega-3 fatty acid mainly find seafood fish oil associate beneficial effect human physiology . Participants : Healthy 35-55 year-old male female subject screen dietary intake EPA DHA . Qualified volunteer divide two group , group 1 : individual voluntarily take least 3 g/wk EPA DHA dietary source include fish oil supplement ocean fish/shellfish consumption period least 6 month prior enrollment study ; group 2 : individual consume 1 serve size ( 4-6 oz ) /month ocean fish/shellfish , 1 pill/month fish oil supplement 6 month period precede enrollment . Procedures ( Methods ) : In observational panel study , subject come U.S. EPA Human Studies Facility 5 session , consist 2 consecutive visit day . The following endpoint collect : blood pressure , heart rate variability measurement , blood biomarkers , endothelial cell function , retinal venule arteriole diameter , lung function . Air pollution exposure assess use area-specific air quality data derive local air monitoring station interfaced activity monitoring GPS track location subject .</detailed_description>
