	<brief_summary>This Phase II Small Business Technology Transfer Research ( STTR ) deliver comprehensive patient communication solution communication-impaired patient intensive care unit may help decrease day delirium , decrease anxiety level , reduce sedation exposure proximal outcome know associate decreased mechanical ventilation day , short length ICU hospital stay , low healthcare cost . The primary goal Phase II STTR proposal define user requirement product specification develop prototype VidaTalk , patient-centric , touch pad communication software , provide mechanically ventilate ( MV ) patient evidence-based solution effectively communicate need care provider family . A secondary goal test impact VidaTalk clinical outcome . This study use mixed method include observation interaction hospitalize patient use VidaTalk tool , survey medical record data extraction , product evaluation brief interview , satisfaction survey family member ICU patient , focus group Registered Nurses . Specific Aim 1 . Develop commercial prototype VidaTalk include multilingual customizable message , compatibility tablet device , picture symbol , integration mobile communication device . Specific Aim 2 . Demonstrate usability iterative user assessment test clinical setting . Specific Aim 3 . Test clinical efficacy VidaTalk via android application MV patient examine qualitative quantitative endpoint clinical setting . Aim 3 hypothesis : MV patient use VidaTalk demonstrate significant reduction patient-reported communication difficulty frustration , anxiety , sedation exposure , delirium/coma-free day , improved patient family satisfaction ICU care compare MV patient receive attention-control ( i.e. , tablets health education application ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Treatment-induced communication impairment one common distressful symptom mechanically ventilate intensive care unit ( ICU ) patient associate anxiety , panic , anger , frustration , sleeplessness , distress.This Phase II Small Business Technology Transfer Research ( STTR ) deliver comprehensive solution may help decrease day delirium , decrease anxiety level , reduce sedation exposure proximal outcome know associate decreased mechanical ventilation day , short length ICU hospital stay , low healthcare cost . The primary goal Phase II STTR proposal define user requirement product specification develop prototype VidaTalk ( previously TouchTalk ) , patient-centric , touch pad communication software , provide mechanically ventilate ( MV ) patient evidence-based solution effectively communicate need care provider family . A secondary goal test impact VidaTalk clinical outcome ( e.g. , patient-reported communication difficulty frustration , anxiety , sedation exposure , delirium/coma-free day , improved patient family satisfaction ICU care ) . This study use mixed method include observation interaction hospitalize patient use VidaTalk communication tool , survey medical record data extraction , product evaluation brief interview , satisfaction survey family member ICU patient focus group Registered Nurses . Our Phase I STTR successfully deliver beta prototype meet technical feasibility criterion ; however , additional requirement emerge common theme user test market analysis . The current study meet identify need VidaTalk operate android device , customizable patient ' unique message need , use picture symbols communication , able route patient request provider present bedside . Specific Aim 1 . Develop commercial prototype VidaTalk include multilingual customizable message , compatibility tablet device , picture symbol , integration mobile communication device . Specific Aim 2 . Demonstrate usability iterative user assessment test clinical setting . Specific Aim 3 . Test clinical efficacy VidaTalk via android application MV patient examine qualitative quantitative endpoint clinical setting . Aim 3 hypothesis : MV patient use VidaTalk demonstrate notable reduction patient-reported frustration communication difficulty , anxiety , sedation exposure , delirium/coma-free day , improved patient family satisfaction ICU care compare MV patient receive attention-control .</detailed_description>
