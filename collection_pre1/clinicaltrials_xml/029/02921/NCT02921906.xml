	<brief_summary>Neonatal diabetes diagnose 6 month age cause high blood glucose level due pancreas secrete insulin . Neonatal diabetes cause change DNA region call KCNJ11 gene . KCNJ11 encode channel pancreas act switch turn 'on ' 'off ' insulin secretion . A change KCNJ11 result faulty channel , keep insulin secretion 'switched ' . The diabetes treat tablet call sulphonylureas switch pancreatic channel 'on ' , allow secrete insulin response gut hormone call incretins . Previous research show patient switch insulin sulphonylureas well blood glucose control , include few episode hypoglycaemia ( glucose drop low ) , also avoid need injection . It think serious side effect sulphonylureas uncommon KCNJ11 neonatal diabetes . Some patient report low glucose meal think may make much insulin eat meal protein low amount carbohydrate . The investigator test give study participant different meal measure amount insulin , glucose incretin hormone blood afterwards .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Food Composition Postprandial Insulin Secretion Neonatal Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anecdotal evidence routine clinical care suggest patient sulphonylurea-treated KCNJ11 neonatal diabetes , eat , may experience mild hypoglycaemia food consume lack carbohydrate . It suggest may due regulation insulin secretion via incretin pathway oppose classical ATP pathway . Therefore investigator hypothesise food relatively high protein content compare relatively high carbohydrate content result excessive insulin secretion relatively low glucose value KCNJ11 patient . This would contrast healthy control subject subject SU-treated T2D insulin secretion moderate ambient glucose via classical ATP pathway . The investigator formally study hypothesis compare insulin , glucose incretin hormone responses high protein meal high carbohydrate meal people KCNJ11 neonatal diabetes , people without diabetes people sulphonylurea-treated Type 2 Diabetes .</detailed_description>
