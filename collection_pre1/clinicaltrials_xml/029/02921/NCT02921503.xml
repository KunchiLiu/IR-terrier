	<detailed_description>Primary Study Endpoints The primary endpoint study measure would topical steroid prescription record ( include unit size , potency , number prescription ) study participant use app . Secondary Study Endpoints The study participant also ask take survey rate user satisfaction clinical utility . 2.1 Scientific Background Gaps The literature show patient dermatologic condition may receive appropriate management PCPs . Dermatologic condition common , affect 20-36 % patient PCP office ; however PCPs report diagnostic management uncertainty.1,2 PCPs show prescribe either inappropriately high-potency TCS , conversely , inappropriately low-potency TCS.3 In addition , recently find drug cost may higher multiple small tube dispense treatment course.4 Thus , opportunities reduce cost prescribing large unit , indicate ; however PCPs may knowledge effectively cost-efficiently prescribe TCS . Teaching information sufficient , since ( 71 % ) medical school provide nine few hour instruction first two years.5 Importantly , mobile device apps provide significantly increased access point-of-care tool , use provider , demonstrate well clinical decision-making improve patient outcomes.6,7 Thus , goal develop point-of-care decision support app educate PCPs facilitate evidence-based care lower health care cost . The mobile application develop team Penn State Hershey result obtain systematic literature review quality assessment clinical practice guideline topical corticosteroid use . The quality guideline assess use AGREE II tool . After app user enters information concern patient ' rash location desire treatment duration , app generate list recommend topical steroid ( focus specific quantity potency ) patient 's particular area need . It ultimately physician whether follow modify recommend suggestion . Study Rationale Smartphone application rise rapidly popularity healthcare field . 85 % clinician report owner smart phone , 50 % use apps practice.8 Use smartphone technology clinical decision support tool may mean improvement primary care practice assist standardization prescribing practice TCS allow dermatologist availability patient high need .</detailed_description>
