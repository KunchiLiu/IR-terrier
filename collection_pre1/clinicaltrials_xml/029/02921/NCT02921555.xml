	<brief_title>Endovenous Corticosteroid Pulses Moderate Ulcerative Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Oral corticosteroid ( CS ) treatment choice moderate flare ulcerative colitis ( UC ) patient 5-aminosalicylic acid ( 5ASA ) maintenance therapy . However , efficacy oral CS limit , 50 % remission rate available randomize control trial ( RCTs ) . By hand , uncompleted disease remission CS use , , clinical endoscopic remission , associate high risk hospitalization need immunomodulator colectomy UC . Uncontrolled data suggest intravenous CS ( IV CS ) may increase remission rate also reduce proportion patient develop steroid-dependency index course CS . The hypothesis study addition 3-day high-dose IV CS pulse schedule administer outpatient infusion unit , add conventional oral CS course increase endoscopic remission rate reduces 1-year proportion patient develop steroid-dependency . This randomized , phase IV , open-label , multicenter , control study . The planned number patient include 148 , distribute two treatment arm ( without initial high-dose CS pulse ) , stratify regard disease onset mesalazine use . The main end-point proportion patient steroid-free , clinical endoscopic remission 8 54 week , rescue therapy . The demonstration high efficacy propose treatment schedule would impact low requirement conventional immunosuppressive therapy ( thiopurines ) biological agent , reduce hospitalization surgery . Moreover , treatment regimen allow outpatient management moderate flare . Baseline characteristic analyze descriptive statistical analysis conventional method . Categorical variable compare use Mann-Whitney test continuous variable Student T test . In order evaluate primary endpoint Chi square test perform compare proportion patient study group achieve clinical endoscopic steroid-free remission 8 week maintain without steroid salvage therapy rescue therapy 54 week . Per protocol ( PP ) intention-to-treat ( IT ) analysis make The Per Protocol analysis include participant adequately adhere protocol , particular receive total amount intervention . Missing outcomes data treat non-response imputation ( NRI ) . The intention-to treat-analysis include randomize patient analysis , retain group allocate , except patient miss outcomes complete treatment regimen due SAE criterion treatment failure . In order evaluate secondary endpoint Chi square test Student T test perform study group . Cumulative probability relapse , steroid dependency surgery evaluate group Kaplan-Meiery , compare use log-rank test . Finally , association analysis early clinical response , clinical endoscopic remission week 8 week 8 54 perform chi-square test Student T test ; variable reach Pvalue ≤ 0.1 include logistic regression analysis .</detailed_description>
