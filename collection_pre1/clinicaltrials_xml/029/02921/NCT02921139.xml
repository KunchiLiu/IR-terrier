	<brief_summary>Till , trans-arterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) still one common modality treat hepatocellular carcinoma patient unresectable intermediate stage . However , residual viable HCC TACE uncommon , lead poor overall survival TACE alone . Recently , stereotactic ablative radiotherapy ( SABR ) report potentially useful curatively manage early-stage HCC retrospective study . Thus , conduct randomized clinical trial test role SABR eradicate post-TACE residual tumor therefore encourage . The present phase-III trial intend compare clinical outcome TACE + SABR TACE + re-TACE HCC patient post-prior-TACE residual tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparing Re-TACE Versus SABR Post-prior-TACE Incompletely Regressed HCC : Randomized Controlled Trial ( TASABR )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Developing effective treatment modality crucial manage HCC patient unresectable intermediate stage . Nowadays , many therapy use treat group HCC patient , include TACE . However , residual tumor TACE uncommon . In conventional , re-TACE recommend manage residual tumor . However , accumulate overall survival still poor consecutive TACEs , lead low rate &lt; 20 % 5 year . In regard , radiotherapy prove effective manage HCC patient , especially novel technique name SABR . When compare conventional-fractionated radiotherapy , SABR demonstrate well treatment response few side effect manage primary metastatic liver tumor . In literature , phase I II trial TACE plus SABR show excellent local control rate promise 1- 2-year survival rate . However , till , head-to-head comparison TACE + SABR consecutive TACEs .</detailed_description>
