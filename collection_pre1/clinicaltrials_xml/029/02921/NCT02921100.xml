	<brief_summary>150 patient suspect pancreatic malignancy plan enrol study . Equal cytological sample patient undergoing EUS-FNA examined digital image analysis conventional cytology respectively . The investigator aim compare efficacy DIA conventional cytology diagnose pancreatic cancer . Further , investigator also collect blood sample enrol patient advance study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison DNA Ploidy Conventional Cytology</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The conventional cytology interpret independently two cytopathologists , blind DIA result . The conventional cytologic diagnosis classify abnormal cell , atypical cell , suspicious malignant cell malignant cell . The specimen examine two experienced cytopathologists . Any disagreement specimen would refer third cytopathologist provide final consensus . The former two diagnosis determine positive , latter two negative . DIA form cytologic analysis quantifies cellular constituent use spectro photometric principle sister technique flow cytometry . Computer analysis pixel produce digital image nucleus cellular constituent . Quantification DNA content , chromatin distribution , nuclear morphology determine suggest feature malignancy . ThinPrep specimens prepared previously described.Per specimen , DNA content least 500 cell select quantification use image analyzer ( Landing Medical High-tech , Wuhan , Hubei , China ) mean integrated optical density lymphocytes serve internal standard control . All histogram suggest presence ( 1 ) cell DNA &gt; 5c ; ( 2 ) diploidy cell high proliferation rate 10 % total cell find proliferation fraction ; ( 3 ) population aneuploidy stem cell , call positive malignancy . Images cell report DNA amount great 5c examine microscopically cytotechnologist exclude artifact dust , air bubble , overlap cell , etc . &gt; 5c cell gallery . All final diagnosis confirm histopathology long term follow .</detailed_description>
