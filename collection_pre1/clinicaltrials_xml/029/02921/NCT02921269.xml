	<brief_title>Atezolizumab Bevacizumab Treating Patients With Recurrent , Persistent , Metastatic Cervical Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess anti-tumor activity ( proportion patient objective response Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors version 1.1 [ RECIST 1.1 ] criterion ) atezolizumab bevacizumab patient recurrent , persistent metastatic cervical cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate duration progression free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) . II . To assess safety Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events version 4.0 ( CTCAE v.4.0 ) . III . To describe efficacy combination atezolizumab bevacizumab measure objective response , PD-L1 expression tumor immune cell measure semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) . IV . To describe efficacy combination atezolizumab bevacizumab measure objective response , intratumoral peripheral T-cell receptor ( TCR ) clonality tumor infiltrate lymphocyte proportion . OUTLINE : Patients receive atezolizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30-60 minute bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
