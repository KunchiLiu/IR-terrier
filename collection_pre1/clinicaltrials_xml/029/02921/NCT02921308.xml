	<brief_title>Pulmonary MRI Ex-preterm Children With Without BPD To Understand Risk Emphysematous Changes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Knowledge Date : Bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD ) , common pulmonary complication prematurity , occur 41 % infant born 28 week ' gestation . Defined need oxygen 36 week ' postmenstrual age,2 BPD result longterm morbidity child adult , include reduce lung function , early cardiovascular disease premature death The report severity impairment varies , study conduct small number child differ degree prematurity . Furthermore , unclear marker sensitive predict long-term respiratory compromise . While functional measure study , micro-structural difference , may quantify use pulmonary magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , evaluate population , may provide early quantitative marker future respiratory disease , include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . Recent advance clinical care preterm infant permit survival ever premature infant , alveolar development incomplete , represent new , relatively unstudied grow cohort new form BPD . This BPD associate arrested alveolar growth development , reduction alveolar surface area pulmonary capillary blood volume . Yet , little known trajectory associate lung change childhood . Traditional measure pulmonary function lower school age child history BPD preterm-born without BPD , may still within normal reference range . There , however , evidence pulmonary function decline steeply age 8-18 year BPD low infant lung function predict low adult lung function . This particularly concern since increase recognition preterm bear adult significant burden early lung disease . Emphysema report young adult history prematurity less extreme prematurity see today . X-ray compute tomography ( CT ) image detects pulmonary abnormality 98 % , emphysema 47 % less premature cohort young adult . Not CT abnormality , however , impaired pulmonary function test ( PFTs ) , thus highlight limitation conventional PFTs detect disease . In childhood , PFTs , powerful indicator global lung health , may relatively insensitive detect early pulmonary structural change regional lung abnormality . Pulmonary dysfunction may cause symptom rest correlate PFTs childhood , may become apparent exercise , infection , age . Structural change lung parenchyma may already present childhood may earlier marker current future respiratory disease conventional PFT . Such change may detect pulmonary MRI lung , show COPD pilot work BPD MRI significant advantage CT , include lack exposure ionize radiation high resolution fine tissue structure . Recent advance pulmonary MRI , include ultra-short echo time pulse sequence , generate pulmonary image enhance parenchymal signal intensity rival CT image visualization lung parenchyma vasculature . MRI emerge research tool may ultimately replace CT pediatric thoracic image task serial evaluation . To Investigators knowledge , conventional ultra-short echo time 1H MRI study child history prematurity BPD perform quantify microstructural pulmonary abnormality . The Investigators therefore propose study compare pulmonary micro-structural ( MRI ) functional ( PFT ) abnormalities premature child without history BPD . The investigator hypothesize pulmonary tissue destruction and/or emphysematous change evident MRI bad ex-premature infant history BPD without history BPD . Further , investigator hypothesize MRI sensitive detect lung change PFT , MRI change correlate PFT abnormality . Ultimately , information form basis future longitudinal study evaluate progression pulmonary disease ass effect new treatment strategy population . Research Questions Amongst 7-9 year old child history prematurity ( &lt; 28 week ' gestation ) , compare without history BPD 1 . Are measureable difference pulmonary micro-structure , quantify use MRI signal intensity ( primary question ) ? 2 . What association pulmonary micro-structural measurement quantify use pulmonary MRI pulmonary function outcome ( secondary question ) : 1. airflow limitation , measure forced expiratory volume one second ( FEV1 ) , FEV1/FVC , mid-expiratory flow ( FEF25-75 ) 2. lung volume gas trapping , measure total lung capacity ( TLC ) , residual volume ( RV ) RV/TLC ratio 3. diffusion capacity carbon monoxide ( DLCO ) , marker pulmonary alveolar volume pulmonary diffusing capacity 4. respiratory symptom , social environmental exposure history healthcare utilization , assess validate questionnaire ( ATS-DLD-78-a ) Methods Study Setting : This cross-sectional study carry three Canadian tertiary care pediatric centre ( Children 's Hospital Eastern Ontario , Ottawa , Ontario , The Hospital Sick Children , Toronto , Ontario Centre Hospitalier Universitaire ( CHU ) Sainte-Justine , Montreal , Quebec ) . Ethics approval obtain participate site . Analysis : Descriptive statistic use describe two group . The primary analysis comparison signal intensity child history BPD without , adjust exposure earlier ( 24-26 week ) later ( 27-28 week ) gestational age , use two-way analysis variance . Secondary analysis examine association MRI signal intensity PFT , well signal intensity respiratory symptom ATS-DLD-78-c questionnaire , use Spearman correlation . Exploratory analysis also examine association PFT respiratory symptom , well parental smoking exposure , relationship obstetrical neonatal historical factor signal intensity , PFT , respiratory symptom . Feasibility : Imaging Feasibility : The MRI pulse sequence foundation study previously develop validate 3T GE scanner Dr. Parraga , serve Co-Principal Investigator propose research.42 The MR acquisition enable use MR infrastructure 3 sit 32 channel cardiac coil . Proof-of-concept presence extensive emphysema provide 25 year old history prematurity BPD , significant MRI-evidence widespread alveolar acinar duct abnormality consistent emphysema Recruitment Feasibility : Each year , approximately 400 infant bear &lt; 28 week ' gestation attend neonatal clinic follow-up visit 18 month age , three participate centre . As already establish database child site , identification eligible study participation easily achieve . At CHU Sainte-Justine , approximately 80 child age 5-7 year see annually previous study recruit 5 year , participation rate 60 % , support feasibility study . Anticipated Results Conclusions The Investigators anticipate significantly severe pulmonary micro-structural abnormality , evidence low pulmonary mean signal intensity , 7-9 year old bear less 28 week ' gestation , history BPD , compare child bear less 28 week ' gestation without BPD . The investigator expect mean MRI-derived signal intensity correlate significantly PFT measurement , well presence chronic respiratory symptom increase healthcare utilization . This first study use innovative MRI technique relation functional testing help characterize regional pulmonary tissue destruction and/or emphysematous change present child history extreme prematurity , without BPD . In particular , MRI measurement may sensitive marker early lung disease PFT respiratory symptom . Since child may manifest sign respiratory impairment presence stressor , knowledge MRI change may prompt earlier aggressive respiratory support treatment prevent respiratory compromise . Ultimately , may opportunity future intervene additional treatment may halt progression adult lung disease . This particularly important , give increase body evidence early COPD-like disease group . This work may identify BPD-COPD overlap syndrome , unique pathophysiology potentially differential response treatment traditional COPD . Potential Challenges : Children recruit study neonatal follow-up clinic database capture graduate neonatal nursery survive 18 month . It possible family may since relocate lose follow-up and/or willing participate research study age 7-9 year differ willing/able participate . Further , study child able perform PFT cooperate MRI , investigator exclude significant neurodevelopmental delay , may also severe lung disease . As main study outcome , however , necessary . Inclusion child history BPD ensure severe end spectrum early pulmonary complication , expect severe lung disease , study . Exercise test another methodology ass pulmonary cardiovascular function . It beyond feasibility budget ( $ 200 per test ) study also require coordination task may challenge participant . Nonetheless , important consideration future work . There precedent pulmonary MRI child , particularly prematurity BPD . Traditionally , MRI consider suboptimal comparison CT lung parenchyma imaging , due low tissue density loss signal magnetic field inhomogeneity air lung interface . Novel ultra-short echo time ( UTE ) pulse sequence , however , permit great signal pulmonary parenchyma , make MRI viable strategy assess emphysematous change population , without exposure ionize radiation . In neonatal intensive care unit , MRI show signal decrease suggestive alveolar simplification ( emphysema ) severe BPD . It possible child history extreme prematurity without BPD also degree pulmonary parenchymal change MRI , although still expect abnormality severe history BPD . This study , however , power detect small difference signal intensity group observe adult COPD study . The investigator use healthy term control group purpose research ass radiological functional biomarkers help clinician researcher identify among preterm born child great risk long-lasting pulmonary problem would benefit treatment . Relevance : The ever grow population extremely preterm born individual , represent approximately 27,000 Canadians less 18 year old , approximately 40 % BPD , risk development early COPD-like emphysematous change . Thus , neonatal condition may origin substantial disproportionately high burden adult lung disease , associate significant morbidity mortality . Prematurity BPD , addition smoking , one strong predictor obstructive airway disease later life . In order promote lung health reduce global burden chronic lung disease , necessary understand trajectory lung growth , development decline across lifespan at-risk population . Use novel imaging strategy , sensitive PFT respiratory symptom quantify early change lung , provide new knowledge natural history BPD population . Furthermore , MRI change quantify improvement associate therapeutic intervention safely serially evaluate across lifespan . This particularly important exciting , give new therapy horizon treat BPD , include stem cell treatment .</detailed_description>
