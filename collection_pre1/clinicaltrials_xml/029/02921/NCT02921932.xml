	<detailed_description>Frailty geriatric syndrome , define increase vulnerability stressor lead state decrease physiological resistance . It characterise `` constellation symptom sign describe heterogeneous response older adult physiological metabolic challenge . '' While frailty necessarily synonymous chronological age , prevalent among old adult population associate threefold increase risk mortality major morbidity postsurgery . Thus , become critically important healthcare system develop strategy design improve clinical outcome high-risk population undergo surgery . Currently clear intervention proven modify syndrome frailty impact postoperative outcomes . This study investigate novel multidisciplinary approach implement within short time frame prior surgery . We plan study efficacy preoperative `` bundle '' intervention , consist preoperative physiotherapy , nutritional support cognitive exercise elderly frail patient undergo major abdominal surgery , evaluate outcome base 1 ) length hospital stay 2 ) Functional recovery surgery 3 ) post-operative complication .</detailed_description>
