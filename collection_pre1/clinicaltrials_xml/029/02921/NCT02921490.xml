	<brief_summary>Chronic pain incur half trillion dollar lose productivity ( healthcare , lose wage , etc ) annually . The common source low back pain ( LBP ) , often facet joint . The clinical evaluation facet joint challenge anatomic imaging finding facet joint ; degenerative change ; correlate poorly pain . Therefore , difficult select appropriate candidate patients/facet joint treat . Misguided percutaneous treatment cost thousand dollar per session delay diagnose . Very limited retrospective information suggest high grade peri-facet MRI signal change correlate side LBP . However , fully characterize imaging finding correlate expert clinical exam/percutaneous response , preclude robust meaningful clinical impact . Minimal retrospective data concludes inflammatory change identify FDG-PET exam , evidence correlation patient pain lacking . Limited DWI exist inflammatory spondyloarthropathies myopathy , also lack . This exploratory study investigate utility FDG PET activity MRI signal change around facet joint clinical management low back pain . This study help determine image biomarkers could change clinical management . Additionally , provide data vital planning large prospective study evaluate ability image biomarkers predict response comparison medial branch block RF ablation treatment facet joint pain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>FDG PET/MRI Evaluation Facet Joint Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>10 patient clinical suspicion least 60 % likelihood low back pain arises lumbar facet joint recruit clinic . The clinician rate likelihood clinically facet joint origin pain assign theoretical treatment plan base initial clinical impression . They indicate facet joint , , would refer percutaneous treatment . The patient undergo FDG PET/MRI lumbar spine IV gadolinium . The MRI signal change enhancement lumbar facet joint grade 2 radiologist blind clinical data . The FDG PET scan activity facet joint grade two nuclear medicine radiologist blind clinical information . The clinician segmentally unblended image data follow : 1. facet joint high grade MRI signal change , 2. facet joint MRI signal change , 3. facet joint high grade PET activity , 4. facet joint PET activity . At 4 step , clinician indicate information would potential alter clinical care ( assume image biomarker question would surrogate inflammation pain ) information concordant clinical impression . The clinical course patient follow 1 year undergo PET/MRI examination .</detailed_description>
