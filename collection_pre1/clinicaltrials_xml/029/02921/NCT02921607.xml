	<detailed_description>Heart failure significant public health issue prevalence 2 % , among leading cause hospital admission worldwide , particularly over-65 year . Patients heart failure frequently require acute hospitalisation increase risk mortality ( half heart failure patient die within five year initial diagnosis , American Heart Association ) . The high hospital admission rate readmission reduce quality life significantly drive cost health care provision patient . Moreover , high variability report readmission rate across institution country , indicate structure health care delivery variable significant importance outcome population . This study set investigate clinically effective cost- efficient method deliver care patient heart failure focus phase immediately hospital admission , hospital stay immediate discharge period , analysis current standard practice Ireland United Kingdom .</detailed_description>
