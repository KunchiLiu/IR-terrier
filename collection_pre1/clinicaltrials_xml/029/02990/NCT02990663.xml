	<brief_summary>High blood pressure common presence increase risk cardiovascular mortality morbidity ( notably stroke , myocardial infarction , congestive heart failure ) . Given blood pressure normally high day overnight , blood pressure lower medication traditionally take morning . However randomize trial 2156 Spanish hypertension patient publish 2010 ( `` MAPEC '' ) , suggest large ( 61 % ) reduction mortality cardiovascular morbidity medication instead take bedtime . This degree benefit far exceed establish method cardiovascular risk reduction - surprisingly large effect require independent confirmation practice change . BedMed pragmatic randomize control trial ( target N = 8750 ) facilitate 300 Canadian family physician member Pragmatic Trials Collaborative . During conduct trial consent hypertensive primary care patient , already establish one antihypertensive medication , randomize either morning bedtime antihypertensive use . Patient orient trial outcome evaluate potential benefit harm draw largely administrative health data routinely collect resident Canada 's publicly fund health care system . This trial event driven ( end upon occurrence 406 primary outcome event ) expect run period roughly 3 year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>THE OPPORTUNITY BEDTIME PRESCRIBING MIGHT PROVIDE : Blood pressure normally exhibit circadian rhythm relatively low pressure sleep . ( Ref 1 ) Lack sleep time `` dip '' correlate strongly adverse cardiovascular event BP correlate strongly event measure night ( i.e . sleep ) . ( Ref 2-5 ) Motivated observation , Spanish researcher study effect take BP medication BEDTIME ( effect nighttime BP would greatest ) versus conventional morning use , BP medication take . The result study ( MAPEC trial ) striking . ( Ref 6 ) Over median 5.6 year follow-up , adverse cardiovascular event occur 187 1084 subject take BP medication morning 68 1072 subject take BP medication bedtime ( relative risk 0.39 , 95 % CI [ 0.29-0.51 ] , p &lt; 0.001 ) . This 61 % reduction adverse event similar individual component primary outcome ( include death cause , stroke , MI , new angina pectoris , CHF retinal artery occlusion ) . If true , switch bedtime prescribe would impact health hypertensive patient whether high BP treat . However extraordinary claim require extraordinary evidence - independent replication surprising finding need widespread practice change occur . BEDMED : The BedMed trial pragmatic primary care trial intend verify whether bedtime antihypertensive use , compare conventional morning use , reduces major adverse cardiovascular event . It design adaptive randomize registry trial within community primary care draw trial outcome baseline covariates provincial administrative claim data ( vital statistic , hospital separation , physician service , prescription dispenses , laboratory data ) . Covariates primary analysis include age , sex , physical frailty ( continuous , determine Tilburg Frailty Indicator Physical Components sub-score ) , cognitive impairment ( continuous , determine Short Blessed Test score ) , current smoking status , hospitalization 6 month prior enrolment , ≥3 baseline BP med ( resistant hypertension ) , presence/absence specific diagnosis ( diabetes , CHF , stroke/TIA , coronary artery disease , sleep apnea ) , BMI &gt; 30 , ≥ 4 additional non-BP lowering medication ( polypharmacy ) , kidney disease ( claim data renal insufficiency diagnosis eGFR le 40 ) , end-stage kidney disease dialysis . Subgroup analysis base presence absence covariates carry ( use age threshold ≥ 70 yr , Tilburg physical frailty threshold ≥ 3 , Short Blessed cognitive impairment threshold ≥ 7 ) . BedMed government funded/facilitated , event driven ( trial break upon 406 primary outcome event ) , 300 volunteer primary care provider recruit , expect enrol 8,750 consent community patient hypertension , rely heavily collaboration volunteer family physician Pragmatic Trials Collaborative ( www.PragmaticTrials.ca ) recruit trial Alberta SPOR Support Unit 's Data Platform - facilitate access analyze relevant administrative database ( http : //www.aihealthsolutions.ca/initiatives-partnerships/spor/ ) . DIURETIC SUB-STUDY : The `` adaptive '' element BedMed trial design refers interim examination bedtime diuretic tolerance . Although commonly believe diuretic ca n't take bedtime without induce unwanted nocturia , sparse evidence literature suggest may case . ( Ref 7,8 ) Rather exclude patient whose medication diuretic investigator instead initially include patient evaluate bedtime diuretic tolerance early trial determine whether patient continue enrol . Specifically , upon allocate bedtime dose 203 patient whose BP medication AM diuretic ( exclude diuretic / non-diuretic combination pill ) investigator analyze 6-week compliance bedtime allocation participant single morning BP medication ( type ) . If diuretic compliance worse , `` adaptive '' trial design exclude enrolment additional patient whose BP medication diuretic . The BedMed investigator report bedtime diuretic tolerance separate ( advance ) main BedMed analysis . INTERIM SAFETY ANALYSIS : An independent data safety monitor board ( DSMB ) organize chair Jim Wright ( Cochrane Hypertension Review Group Coordinating Editor ) review data upon reach 200 event ( estimate occur ~20 month ) . If p ≤ 0.001 benefit ( Haybittle-Peto boundary - recommend reduce chance stop early magnifying benefit ) , p ≤ 0.05 harm , DSMB apply clinical judgement make recommendation steer committee whether trial break early .</detailed_description>
