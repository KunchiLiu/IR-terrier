	<detailed_description>A cerebral aneurysm ( also know intracranial intracerebral aneurysm ) weak thin spot blood vessel brain balloon fill intermixes parent artery blood . Aneurysms occur age . Global incidence varies country , report prevalence range 5.1 19.6 case per 100,000 person . With development image technology great attention pay people overall health , aneurysms detect . The combination sophisticate imaging equipment , frequent use imaging patient , aforementioned emphasis optimum health , lead great proportion asymptomatic aneurysm discover . The common type aneurysm saccular ; , aneurysms likely occur woman . The devastate presentation intracranial aneurysm subarachnoid hemorrhage ( SAH ) . It estimate , average , five percent population afflict incidence aneurysm rupture ( SAH ) 6 9 per 1000 000 individual . Mortality approach 50 % , few 60 % survivor return independent living . Invasive treatment aneurysm begin open surgical procedure refer 'surgical clipping ' . This treatment consider gold standard treatment aneurysm . The first neurovascular interventional medical device Guglielmi Detachable Coil ( GDC ) , develop test mid-1990s introduce Dr. Guido Guglielmi Target Therapeutics , Fremont , California . These bare platinum coil electrolytically detach placement aneurysm sac . It take approximately one decade prove coil superiority surgical clipping , publication result ISAT Study . Since time , coil become sophisticated makeup conformation . Coil use also mainstay neurovascular procedure .</detailed_description>
