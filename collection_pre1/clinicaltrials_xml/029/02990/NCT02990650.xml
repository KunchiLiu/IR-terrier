	<brief_title>Outcomes Associated With Progressive Balance And Gait Training Using The KineAssist® Robot</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several study investigate use balance gait training demonstrate significant improvement walk speed train stroke survivor . The inherent risk associate balance gait training require therapist vigilant provide safety support challenge task . As result , consumer challenge furthest limit therapist put inordinate amount physical effort safety control . KineAssist® Design , LLC collaboration Rehabilitation Institute Chicago , develop KineAssist® Balance Gait Training System ( KineAssist® ) . The KineAssist® novel device allow full freedom motion trunk pelvis gait balance task , additional postural control enhance balance stability . These function available device follow individual overground minimal interference . The availability postural control complex omnidirectional movement task allow clinician guarantee consumer safety body weight support time provide grade task challenge fullest limit consumer capability . This KineAssist® revolutionary first device fully interactive responsive movement intention consumer therapist overground challenge balance gait activity . Accordingly , long-term objective research test efficacy robotically enhance , progressive gait balance training improve walk outcomes post-stroke . The following two aim design test whether KineAssist® provide challenge train environment typical physical therapy , compare walk outcome result long-term ( 6 week ) training . Aim : Using randomize control research design , compare walk outcome result gait balance train standard physical therapist interaction versus train addition KineAssist®t . Overall , study important advance development effective clinical intervention individual impair locomotor ability post-stroke . This study provide critical information physiological effect clinical outcome provide important evidence use new class robotic technology accommodate clinician consumer stroke rehabilitation .</detailed_description>
