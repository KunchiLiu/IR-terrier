	<brief_title>A Clinical Trial Screening Atrial Fibrillation ( AF-CATCH )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Study name : A randomized clinical trial atrial fibrillation screen use automate electrocardiogram system elderly Chinese population 2 . Rationale : The incidence atrial fibrillation rise continuously.The main detrimental effect atrial fibrillation complication stroke.Failure diagnosis management atrial fibrillation incidence stroke lead high mortality disability . It therefore imperative diagnose manage atrial fibrillation timely effective fashion prevent complication atrial fibrillation , screen follow use proven therapy , warfarin . An automated handheld ECG system base smartphone recently become available screen atrial fibrillation high risk people.However , system effectively use widespread screen atrial fibrillation remain question require investigation . Moreover , repeat recording higher yield atrial fibrillation diagnosis [ 11 ] , certain constitutes optimum number ECG recording balance cost effectiveness . The present study therefore design randomize control trial investigate whether frequent ECG recording analysis automate ECG system would significantly improve detection atrial fibrillation compare single annual ECG screen elderly Chinese population community health centre . 3 . Objective : The primary objective investigate whether frequent ECG recording analysis automate ECG system ( 4 times/year ) would significantly improve detection atrial fibrillation compare single annual ECG screen.The secondary objective explore whether even frequent ECG recording analysis ( 8 times/year ) would improve detection atrial fibrillation . 4 . Study design : The present study design randomize control trial parallel group ( two ) 5 . Study population : Men woman age least 65 year ( n=7000 ) recruit 5 community health center city Shanghai . Eligible patient meet following inclusion exclusion criteria.Inclusion Criteria:1 ) Age≥65 year ; 2 ) Absence atrial fibrillation baseline ; 3 ) Willing capable visit outpatient clinic his/her long-term follow-up . Exclusion Criteria:1 ) Known persistent paroxysmal atrial fibrillation : Sinus rhythm pharmacological electric cardioversion , radiofrequency ablation ; Use anticoagulant therapy atrial fibrillation ; Use medication heart rate control ; Untreated atrial fibrillation.2 ) Serious life-threatening disease , , cancer , severe cardiac , cerebral , liver , kidney disease , etc ; 3 ) Difficult long-term follow-up visit reason 6 . Randomization treatment : Eligible subject randomize 1:1 ratio usual intensive screen group 3500 patient group , within intensive screen group 3:1 ratio intensive intensive subgroup 2625 875 patient , respectively . 1 ) Usual screen group : ECG recording baseline plus 1 year follow-up ; two ECG recording total . 2 ) Intensive screen subgroup : ECG recording baseline plus quarterly follow-up , month 3 , 6 , 9 12 ; 5 ECG recording total . 3 ) More intensive screen subgroup : ECG recording baseline plus weekly first month follow-up quarterly afterwards , week 1 , 2 , 3 4 month 3 , 6 , 9 12 ; 9 ECG recording total . The automated electrocardiogram analysis system AliveCor® Heart Monitor use perform ECG recording analysis immediate diagnosis atrial fibrillation . At one year follow-up , follow-up questionnaire administer physical examination perform . All detected case atrial fibrillation evaluate regular 12-lead ECG , refer specialist ' centre treatment . 7 . Follow : In usual screening group , patient followed-up community health centre baseline 12 month follow-up . In intensive screen group , patient followed-up baseline 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 month follow-up . In intensive screening subgroup , patient followed-up weekly first month follow-up 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 month follow-up . 8 . Sample size estimation : The detection rate atrial fibrillation single 12-lead ECG 2.5 % elderly people live Shanghai Of 2.5 % , 0.5 % aware atrial fibrillation . The detection rate atrial fibrillation ECG record baseline another 12 month could estimate 2.0 % elderly people without awareness atrial fibrillation . The primary hypothesis detection rate could improve 50 % frequent ECG recording . If =0.05 , power=80 % one-sided test assume , 1:1 ratio would use assign patient usual intensive ECG screening , study require sample size 3013 subject per group . In consideration 15 % super-addition , approximately 3500 eligible subject per group enrol . The number require subject whole trial 7000 . 9 . Timeline : Enrollment rate : 1000 patient /month ; Planned publication /presentation : June 2019 ; Start subject enrollment : December 2016 ; End subject enrollment : June 2017 ; End study : June 2018 10 . Organization : The study conduct single research center ( Ruijin Hospital ) 5 community health center . Patients recruit follow community health physician 5 community health center , supervision cardiologist Ruijin Hospital . ECG record community health center . Atrial fibrillation initially diagnose software build smart phone . ECG also transmit cloud platform storage analysis . If atrial fibrillation detect , 12-lead ECG immediately perform verification confirmation diagnosis atrial fibrillation . The identified patient atrial fibrillation refer outpatient clinic Ruijin Hospital management .</detailed_description>
