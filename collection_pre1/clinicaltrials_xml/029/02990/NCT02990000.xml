	<brief_summary>Research show mental health care ( MHC ) provider differ significantly ability help patient . In addition , provider demonstrate different pattern effectiveness across symptom functioning domain . For example , provider reliably effective treat numerous patient problem domain , others reliably effective domain ( e.g. , depression , substance abuse ) yet appear struggle others ( e.g. , anxiety , social functioning ) , reliably ineffective , even harmful , across patient domain . Knowledge provider difference base largely patient-reported outcome collect routine MHC setting . Unfortunately , provider performance information systematically use refer assign particular patient scientifically base best-matched provider . MHC system continue rely random purely pragmatic case assignment referral , significantly `` water '' odds patient assigned/referred high perform provider patient 's area ( ) need , increase risk assigned/referred provider may track record ineffectiveness . This research aim solve exist non-patient-centered provider-matching problem . Specifically , investigator aim demonstrate comparative effectiveness scientifically-based patient-provider match system compare status quo pragmatic case assignment . The investigator expect scientific match group significantly well treatment outcome ( e.g. , symptom , quality life ) high patient satisfaction treatment . The investigator also expect demonstrate feasibility implement scientific match process community MHC system broad dissemination easily replicate scientific match technology diverse health care setting . The importance work patient understated . Far many patient struggle find right provider , unnecessarily prolongs suffer promotes health care system inefficiency . A scientific match system base routine outcome data use patient-generated information direct patient provider set . In addition , base multidimensional assessment , allow wide variety patient-centered outcome represent ( e.g. , symptom domain , function domain , quality life ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Enhancing Mental Health Care Scientifically Matching Patients Providers ' Strengths</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Significance : Mental illness extraordinary highly burdensome public health problem . Unfortunately , even individual access mental health care ( MHC ) , care often substandard . Research consistently demonstrate approximately 10-15 % patient deteriorate experience harm treatment . Further , rate combine no-change rate , 40 % less patient meaningfully recover . Importantly , treatment research illuminate substantial variability provider ' outcome . Simply put , MHC provider impact treatment outcomes , stakeholder lack systematic access valid actionable information optimize effective patient-provider match . Without collect disseminate performance data , stakeholder lack vital information base health care choice personalize treatment . Conversely , potentially immense advantage match patient provider base scientific outcome data . Patients , stakeholder , researcher , clinician endorse apply knowledge transfer high priority . In response , investigator develop piloted technology test match concept patient-centered health model . Prominent health care agency place outcome/performance measurement center core initiative . The Institute Medicine specifically recommend integrate provider performance data treatment decision-making . Despite rhetoric , 2 Cochrane Reviews combine could identify 4 study address question minimal methodology standard ; result mixed . Importantly , none involve targeted dissemination intervention , none involve MHC . Previous research , include , empirically demonstrate substantial difference project treatment effect size depend therapist patient refer . The key evidence gap need rigorous test effectiveness target MHC provider-performance dissemination intervention compare standard/pragmatic referral case assignment . Relatedly , PCORI call increase `` precision '' `` personalize '' treatment , focus tailoring . The match algorithm respond directly high priority call customize care personal evidence-based way . Study Aims : The aim CER test effectiveness innovative , scientifically inform patient-therapist referral match algorithm base MHC provider outcome data . The investigator employ randomize controlled trial ( RCT ) compare match algorithm commonplace pragmatic referral matching ( base provider availability , convenience , self-reported specialty ) . Psychosocial treatment remain naturalistically administer varied provider ( e.g. , psychologist , social worker ) patient complex mental health concern within partner clinic network , Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates ( HVMA ) . The investigator hypothesize scientific match group outperform pragmatic match group decrease patient symptom treatment dropout , promote patient functional outcome , outcome expectation , care satisfaction , well patient-therapist alliance quality . Doing establish match algorithm mechanism effective patient-centered MHC . Study Description : The investigator compare effectiveness naturalistic MHC either without scientific matching aid double blind , individual level RCT . The investigator first conduct baseline assessment HVMA therapist ' ( N=44 ) performance ( across 20 case ) determine strengths treat 12 behavioral health domain measure primary outcome measure match algorithm base : Treatment Outcome Package ( TOP ) . TOP already administer routinely partner network . Based year predictive analytic research , tool classifies therapists `` effective , '' `` unclassifiable/ineffective , '' `` harmful '' TOP domain . The blinded therapist cross condition . A research assistant ass baseline new adult patient ( N = 264 , 6 per therapist , base power analysis ) refer mental health primary care provider . The patient exclusion criterion people primary decision-maker care . Thus , patient present multitude problem across spectrum diagnosis . In addition diagnostic interview relevant measure dependent variable demographic characteristic , baseline assessment include risk-adjusted TOP score inform experimental group match . Next , patient randomly assign match group scientific match group . Treatment outcome assess regularly mutual termination 16 week . Ancillary assessment include self- clinician-rated global distress , therapeutic alliance quality , patient outcome expectation , treatment dropout , patient satisfaction . Primary analysis involve hierarchical linear model examine comparative rate pattern change outcomes . Although performance measurement exist decade research begin explore impact disseminate provider performance data health care outcome , ( ) rarely employ RCT design , ( b ) typically focus correlate passive dissemination distal systems-level outcome , ( c ) conduct outside MHC . This research address limitation investigate comparative effectiveness use MHC provider outcome inform assignment/referral patient scientifically match psychotherapist . This comparator ideal represent status quo virtually attempt make use scientific data match specific patient specific therapist prove track record patient 's area ( ) need .</detailed_description>
