	<brief_summary>In 2011 , premier Canadian province territory select diabetes foot care 1 3 significant target pan-provincial action . Of 210,000 people diabetes Alberta , 5,250 seek treatment foot ulcer annually . In Alberta 2014-15 425 low limb amputation ( LLA ) . Moreover , tremendous reduction quality life patient attendant negative effect family . The 5-year mortality rate new-onset diabetic foot ulcer 43-55 % high 74 % patient undergoing LLA ( CIHI , 2013 ) . The Diabetes Foot Care Clinical Pathway Project ( DFCCPP ) aim optimize method early detection treatment foot ulcer effort reduce LLA 50 % implement High Risk Foot Teams ( HRFTs ) across province start 3 Pilot site . Existing staff expertise knowledge diabetic foot care assess treat patient moderate high-risk finding . In conjunction DFCCPP , efficacy technological advancement develop Alberta-based small-to-medium enterprise ( SME ) improve diabetic foot outcomes evaluate . Exsalt® SD7 Wound Dressings ( Exciton Technologies , Edmonton , AB ) demonstrate in-vitro in-vivo provide rapid effective antibacterial activity easy-to-use format , thus create enhance wound heal environment support patient quality life . The objective propose work twofold , namely 1 ) quantify clinical efficacy exsalt® Wound Dressings locally infect diabetic foot ulcer progress heal current standard care : evaluating key indicator infection , Infectious Diseases Society America ( IDSA ) wound classification , wound size ; identify benefit foot ulcer heal 2 ) evaluate subjective patient outcome : satisfaction , perceive benefit , compliance . Evaluating benefit utilization Exciton exsalt® Wound Dressings combine DFCCP .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>2 Background Information 2.1 Device Description Exsalt® Wound Dressings ( Test Dressings ) contain oxidize silver oxysalts deposit throughout non-woven polyester/High density polyethylene non-adherent dressing . Silver exsalt® Wound Dressings inhibit microbial growth dress . The concentration silver oxidize silver specie dress 0.4 mg/cm2 ( 2.5 % w/w ) . The exsalt® dressing show effective vitro Staphylococcus aureus , Escherichia coli , Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Enterococcus faecalis . Exsalt® Wound Dressings maintain antibacterial activity 7 day Pseudomonas aeruginosa Staphylococcus aureus . Exsalt® Wound Dressings indicate management partial full thickness wound , include decubitus ulcer , venous stasis ulcer , diabetic ulcer , first second degree burn , graft donor site , acute chronic wound . The dressing may use debrided grafted wound . 2.2 Study History The Canadian Institute Health Information estimate foot wound ( diabetes lead cause ) present 4 % hospital inpatient , 7 % homecare client 10 % long-term care resident ( CIHI , 2013 ) . Ulcerations critical event loss limbs amputation create avenue infection may exacerbate necrotic tissue ischemia . Of 210,000 people diabetes Alberta , 5,250 seek treatment foot ulcer annually . In Alberta 2014-15 425 LLA perform 309 diabetic patient represent increase 89 LLA 2010-11 . The 5-year mortality rate new-onset diabetic foot ulcer 43-55 % high 74 % patient undergoing LLA ( Ollendorf et al , 1998 ) . Moreover , tremendous reduction quality life patient negative effect family . The Diabetes Foot Care Clinical Pathway Project ( DFCCPP ) aim optimize method early detection treatment foot ulcer effort reduce LLA 50 % improve patient 's quality life . Therefore , need effective tool prevention management local infection diabetic foot ulcer . 2.3 Device History Exsalt® wound dressing date formally evaluate ( include clinical study post-market surveillance ) 125 patient throughout North America Europe . In study , many wound etiology investigate include : venous leg ulcer , diabetic ulcer , diabetic neuropathic ulcer , post-surgical wound , wound result trauma , skin tear , pressure ulcer , burn wound , chronic non-healing ulcer . The formal clinical evaluation investigate safety efficacy Exsalt® wound dress device . Data feedback generate support wound healing , increase granulation tissue lessen pain , odor , sign infection ( Thomason et al , 2016 ; Lemire et al , 2015 ) . The wound dress show support progression wound closure wound heal without sign toxicity side-effects . 2.4 Risk Summary Precautions need take use exsalt® Wound Dressing use patient know sensitivity silver ; compatible oil-based product , petrolatum ; compatible magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) procedures ; remove prior administer radiation therapy ; come contact electrode conductive gel electronic measurement ( e.g . EEG , ECG ) . Additionally , frequent prolong use Exsalt® wound dressing may result permanent discoloration skin . 2.5 Benefit Summary Benefits product vs. silver antimicrobial include rapid sustained bactericidal activity ; broad spectrum activity ; minimize pain ; reduce stain skin ; non-toxicity human tissue ; decrease likelihood resistance ; cost-effectiveness require less silver . 2.6 Good Clinical Practice Regulatory Requirements 2.6.1 Regulatory Requirements : Exsalt® Wound Dressing Exsalt® Wound Dressings exsalt® SD7 exsalt® T7 license Canada Health Canada January 2011 March 2012 , respectively . Exsalt® wound dress `` indicated management partial full thickens wound decubitus ulcer , venous stasis ulcer , diabetic ulcer , 1st 2nd degree burn , graft donor site ' acute chronic wound . '' 3 Study Objectives &amp; Purpose The purpose pilot study evaluate effectiveness Exciton exsalt® Wound Dressings combine DFCCP patient locally infect diabetic foot ulcer . The objective propose work twofold , namely 1 ) quantify effectiveness exsalt® Wound Dressings locally infect diabetic foot ulcer progress heal current standard care : evaluating IDSA wound classification , pain , wound size , sign symptom infection one-arm prospective repeat measure pilot study 2 ) compile subjective patient outcome : satisfaction , perceive benefit , compliance . Evaluating benefit utilization Exciton exsalt® Wound Dressings combine DFCCP . Specifically , follow work objective propose : 1 . A prospective , single-arm , repeated measure study pilot use Exsalt® wound dress chronic wound within outpatient clinical setting ; evaluate benefit utilization exsalt® Wound Dressings within DFCCPP . 2 . Repeated measure evaluate reporting wound infection classification ( IDSA ) , pain score , wound size , key indicator infection ; pre post-intervention . Quantifying impact intervention diabetic foot ulcer local infection , healing , associate pain . Qualifying subjective patient outcome include satisfaction , benefit , compliance . Incidence safety adverse event report within scope pilot study . 3.1 Research Questions The research propose design address follow question : 1 . What impact ( monitor key indicator infection , wound size , wound classification ) application exsalt® Wound Dressing utilized primary dress four week outpatients diabetic foot ulcer mild local infection non-responsive use standard-of-care. ? 2 . What clinical utility use Exsalt® wound dress perspective clinical staff patient ? 3 . What benefit utilization Exciton exsalt® Wound Dressings combine DFCCP ? 4 Pilot Study Design 4.1 Study type A prospective , single-arm , repeated measure study pilot study coordinate DON-SCN use exsalt® Wound Dressings mildly infect chronic diabetic foot ulcer wound within three outpatient clinical setting ; evaluate pre post-intervention .</detailed_description>
