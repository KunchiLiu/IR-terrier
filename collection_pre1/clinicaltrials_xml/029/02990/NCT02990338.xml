	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : To demonstrate benefit isatuximab combination pomalidomide low-dose dexamethasone prolongation Progression Free Survival ( PFS ) compare pomalidomide low-dose dexamethasone patient refractory relapse refractory multiple myeloma ( MM ) . Secondary Objectives : - To evaluate Overall Response Rate ( ORR ) per International Myeloma Working Group ( IMWG ) criterion arm . - To compare Overall Survival ( OS ) two arm . - To evaluate Time To Progression ( TTP ) arm . - To evaluate Progression Free Survival ( PFS ) high risk cytogenetic population arm . - To evaluate Duration Response ( DOR ) arm . - To evaluate safety treatment arm . - To determine Pharmacokinetic profile isatuximab combination pomalidomide . - To evaluate immunogenicity isatuximab . - To assess disease-specific generic health-related quality life ( HRQL ) , disease treatment-related symptom , health state utility , health status .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multinational Clinical Study Comparing Isatuximab , Pomalidomide , Dexamethasone Pomalidomide Dexamethasone Refractory Relapsed Refractory Multiple Myeloma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The duration study patient include period screen 3 week . Patients continue study treatment disease progression , unacceptable adverse reaction , patient ' wish reason discontinuation . During follow-up , patient discontinue study treatment due progression disease follow every 3 month ( 12 week ) survival ( cut- date ) , patient discontinue study treatment prior documentation disease progression followed-up every 4 week disease progression , every 3 month ( 12 week ) survival ( cut-off date ) .</detailed_description>
