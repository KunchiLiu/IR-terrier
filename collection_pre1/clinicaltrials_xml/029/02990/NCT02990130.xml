	<brief_title>Patient Fitness Body Composition During Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This proposal aim characterize biochemical physiologic factor contribute change patient fitness body composition hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HCT ) hematologic malignancy . The investigator hypothesize : 1 ) HCT hematologic malignancy associate change biochemical physiologic factor reflect patient fitness 2 ) Baseline ( pre-HCT ) post-HCT change biochemical physiologic factor reflect patient fitness associate HCT-related clinical outcomes.This pilot study involve patient enrol Seattle VA Bone Marrow Transplant Unit ( BMTU ) treatment hematologic malignancy . No vulnerable population include . The study group consist 60 patient hematologic malignancy treat HCT . Measurements patient fitness , body composition , inflammatory milieu perform visit HCT , 30 day ( +/- 10 day ) HCT . For patient continue receive care Seattle VA , additional visit ( exceed 6 total ) may request periodically 2 year HCT . Data collection may include : 1 . Blood test perform clinical standard care may include : anabolic catabolic factor IGF-1 , GH , IGFBP-3 , free weakly bound testosterone , IL-6 , CRP , TNF-alpha , pre-albumin . 2 . Measurements fitness obtain clinical standard care may include : rest energy expenditure ( REE ) assess indirect calorimetry ; body composition measure bio-impedance ( BIA ) dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA ) scan ; handgrip strength ; stair climb power ; 6-minute walk test ; muscle strength ; maximal oxygen consumption ( VO2 max ) ; previously validate questionnaire assess patient quality life ( QOL ) functional status . 3 . Additional data may collect protocol include clinical laboratory data acquire per standard clinical care pertain subject ' co-morbidities , hematologic disease treatment history , clinical course include nutritional status , use nutrition support , estimate nutritional requirement per routine dietitian assessment . A Food Frequency Questionnaire administer dietitian addition routine clinical assessment . The primary endpoint study change time patient fitness assess 6 minute walk test HCT . Secondary endpoint include marker anabolism catabolism , data collect mention .</detailed_description>
