	<brief_summary>Circumcision commonly perform procedure newborn male . Clear recommendation and/or guideline pain control procedure exist . The purpose research compare various form analgesia evaluate effective pain reduction . The investigator hope study provide definitive guideline best form analgesia use circumcision . It important perform study ensure future newborn ' pain circumcision effectively manage .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness Analgesia During Circumcision</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Procedure/Interventions/Drugs Several form analgesia , include local anesthetic cream local anesthetic administer injection , compare method pain control circumcision . All analgesic already use intra-operative pain control circumcision . The drug use study local anesthetic amino-amide group , include lidocaine prilocaine . Because consensus best anesthetic circumcision , investigator propose comparative study . Children take part research put group select chance . There three different group . One group serve control group , three group combination anesthetic test . The control group receive usual anesthetic use normal nursery pain control circumcision , combination group receive additional anesthetic agent . Randomization group do use random sequence generator . The intervention patient place seal envelope , open individual perform circumcision time procedure schedule . The following intervention use : EMLA Topical Product : EMLA cream eutectic mixture 2.5 % lidocaine 2.5 % prilocaine , use topical anaesthetic diminish pain cutaneous procedure . Seventy minute prior circumcision , newborn place circumcision mold leg restrain , attach monitor . 1 gram EMLA cream apply nurse penis use syringe wrap dress ( Tegaderm ) . After sixty minute return circumstrep , reattached monitor , leg restrain . The Tegaderm drug remove , infant leave settle circumcision take place . Dorsal Penile Nerve Block ( DPNB ) : Dorsal penile nerve block anesthetic technique first described 1978 , since extensively evaluate management pain circumcision . DPNB do 1 % lidocaine without epinephrine inject two site base penis ( 2 10 o'clock ) . Ten minute prior circumcision , newborn place circumcision mold leg restrain , attach monitor . A total 2 mg/kg 1 % lidocaine without epinephrine use perform block , equal aliquot milliliter inject two site base penis . The block do circumciser . Five minute block circumcision perform . Ring Block : Ring block another anesthetic technique describe 1990s also examine pain control circumcision . Ring block do 1 % lidocaine without epinephrine inject band around penis halfway along shaft . Ten minute prior circumcision , newborn place circumcision mold leg restrain , attach monitor . A total 2 mg/kg 1 % lidocaine without epinephrine use perform ring block inject band around penis . The block do circumcise physician . Five minute later circumcision perform . Intervention group : Control group : ( 1 ) EMLA Combination Groups : ( 2 ) EMLA + Sucrose ( 3 ) EMLA + Ring Block + Sucrose ; ( 4 ) EMLA + Sucrose + DPNB For group procedure detailed EMLA , DPNB , ring block follow depend patient grouping . General : EMLA use patient . Videotaping : In order ensure study properly blind , video-taping procedure need take place . A video camera set capture infant 's face torso monitor , individual performing circumcision . The video label numerically , patient name . Videos view two individual ( present circumcision responsible obtain consent ) , possible third viewer may require resolve conflict opinion . The video tape see individual , data collection pain score . They keep possession two principal investigator lock drawer office time . The video tape destroy completion study . Outcomes : The primary outcome variable pain score . Pain score consist behavioral component infant facial expression , cry , breathe pattern , arm movement , leg movement . Secondary outcome include effect heart rate , cry time , oxygen saturation ( obtain monitor ) . Patients ' participation end time investigator . Significant new finding convey parent newborn . Risks The main risk participation study : 1. adverse effect might result circumcision , pain , bleeding , surgical trauma , local infection , meatal stenosis . 2. adverse effect may result drug , allergic reaction 3. adverse effect might result specific drug administration technique , EMLA may result methemoglobinemia local skin reaction blanch , edema , erythema . DPNB ring block may result bruising , bleeding , hematoma injection site . 4. adverse effect anesthetic erroneously inject systemically . Although investigator take step minimize risk study , may also unforeseeable risks.The parent may choose withdraw consent time study . Benefits All anesthetic use study already show play role pain reduction circumcision , however seem effective others . The participate child directly benefit study , since pain control extent circumcision procedure . Furthermore , study provide conclusive evidence effective method analgesia , guideline institute future newborn pain successfully control procedure .</detailed_description>
