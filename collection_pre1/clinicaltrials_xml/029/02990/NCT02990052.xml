	<brief_title>Conservative Treatment vs. Volar Plating Distal Radius Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Volar plating become standard approach treat unstable distal radius fracture . The incidence surgically treat patient distal radius fracture increase many fold begin millennium , owe mostly increase number volar plating . The striking increase plate fixation occur old patient group , especially female . With volar fixed-angle plate , near-anatomic , stable fixation relatively low complication rate , achieve even osteoporotic bone . There randomize , prospective study compare result volar plat conservative treatment , compare patient age 65 year . Quite little known result compare conservative treatment volar plating patient age 65 year . Main goal study compare functional radiological result conservative treatment volar fixed-angle plating management distal radius fracture patient age 50 year old .</detailed_description>
