	<brief_title>Reduced Nicotine Cigarettes Smokers With Without Alcohol Use Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current proposal examines response two RNCs , one low nicotine content ( RNC Low ; 0.03mg ) one moderate nicotine content ( RNC Moderate ; 0.8mg ) daily smoker without AUD . Participants ( N = 70 ) attend total five visit laboratory . The first visit classify participant either AUD ( n = 35 ) Non AUD ( n = 35 ) gather baseline data . Participants assign undergo two experimental condition ( i.e. , exclusive smoking RNC Low Moderate home environment 7 day ) double-blind , randomize , crossover design . The two experimental condition separate 7-day period return smoke participant ' brand cigarette . On first last day two experimental condition , participant smoke assigned RNC laboratory , data toxicant exposure ( i.e. , boost exhaled carbon monoxide plasma nicotine cotinine ; solanesol smoke cigarette butt ) , subjective acceptability ( i.e. , subjective response ; risk perception ; relative reinforcing efficacy ) ; smoke compensation ( i.e. , smoke topography measure ) relate smoke RNC collect . During 7-day period exposure RNCs , participant provide daily data alcohol nicotine use , nicotine withdrawal , smoke urge , alcohol urge via telephone-based Interactive Voice Response technology . The strength study design evaluate between-group ( i.e. , AUD v . Non AUD ) within-person ( i.e. , RNC Low v . Moderate ) differences response RNCs , furthermore , examine whether increased nicotine withdrawal , smoke urge , alcohol urge mediate relation decrease nicotine exposure alcohol consumption . Results study show mechanism underlie drink smoking may need addressed future integrate intervention problem immediately inform practical implementation market-wide reduction cigarette nicotine content among smoker AUD .</detailed_description>
