	<brief_summary>This Phase 1a-b study newly diagnose patient biopsy-proven head neck cancer ( squamous cell carcinoma ) undergo standard radiation therapy treatment cisplatin . BMX-001 add radiation therapy cisplatin expect reduce radiation-induced mucositis xerostomia also potential benefit survival head neck cancer patient . In Phase 1a , safety tolerability BMX-001 assess use Continual Reassessment Method ( CRM ) maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . BMX-001 give subcutaneously first load dose zero four day prior start chemoradiation follow twice week dos one-half load dose duration radiation therapy plus two week . In Phase 1b safety efficacy BMX-001 evaluate . Impact mucositis xerostomia also assess . A maximum 48 patient enrol MTD dose determine Phase 1a confirm MTD . The investigator hypothesize BMX-001 add standard radiation therapy cisplatin safe pharmacologically relevant dos patient newly diagnose head neck cancer . The investigator also hypothesize Phase 1b study addition BMX-001 reduce severity radiation-induced mucositis xerostomia patient receive head neck radiation therapy .</brief_summary>
