The purpose study determine whether new mobile health ( mhealth ) intervention assist people safe use opioid analgesic ( OA ) medication leave emergency department ( ED ) . The specific aim project : ( 1 ) adapt enhance exist motivational intervention decrease non-medical opioid use ED visit optimize intervention intensity duration reinforcement learning ( RL ) ; ( 2 ) examine impact RL-supported intervention non-medical opioid use level six month post-ED visit ; ( 3 ) examine impact RL intervention opioid-related behavior adverse outcome drive opioid use , overdose risk behavior , subsequent opioid-related ED visit .

	<detailed_description>The propose study test efficacy interactive voice response ( IVR ) reinforcement learning ( RL ) support motivational intervention deliver emergency department ( ED ) visit participant recent non-medical OA use receive OA ED prescribe OA ED discharge , compare enhance usual care ( EUC ) . In intervention condition , IVR call ask participant report information health medication use touch-tone phone , base response may receive brief extended motivational message IVR call , may assign receive 20 minute motivational enhancement session study therapist phone . Because helpful intensity intervention unknown likely vary patient , project use artificial intelligence strategy call reinforcement learning ( RL ) . The RL system continuously `` learn '' success prior action similar situation similar patient order select action likely reduce non-medical opioid use participant call . The propose study screen ~ 5,600 ED patient enroll 600 ED participant randomize control trial ( RCT ) . Participants randomize intervention condition ( n=300 ) EUC ( n=300 ) . All participant re-assessed 1 , 3 6 month post-ED visit level non-medical OA use relate outcome . The RCT complement qualitative interview inform later implementation .</detailed_description>
