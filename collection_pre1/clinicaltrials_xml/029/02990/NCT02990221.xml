	<brief_summary>The main objective study compare effectiveness ingenol mebutate gel ( 150 mcg / g per day , apply predetermine area 25 cm2 skin face scalp , 3 day consecutive ) cryotherapy ( application 5 second freezing time lesion locate predetermine skin area 25 cm2 face scalp ) treatment actinic keratosis field cancerization . Study detail : This study randomize . 50 subject least two actinic keratoses grade I II , locate two different district 25 cm2 skin face scalp , meet inclusion criterion enrol study investigator three different center mention . The investigator assess effect treatment confocal microscopy digital dermoscopy . The investigator acquire image select area face scalp treatment . Data collect analyzed coordinating centre . Procedure study : Recruitment subject ; random assignment treatment ( ingenol mebutate gel 150 micrograms/g cryotherapy ) two skin area 25 cm2 subject recruit ; evaluation two area reflectance confocal microscopy digital dermoscope . The measurement carry time 0 , 1 month 6 month . The investigator must fill form subject beginning ( day 0 ) , 1 month end study ( 6 month ) . The subject must complete questionnaire beginning ( day 0 ) , 1 month last follow-up visit ( 6 month ) . Measurement parameter : Dermoscopy confocal microscopy use assess percentage reduction actinic keratoses damage cancerous area two select area treat ingenol mebutate gel cryotherapy , respectively . Adverse / side event collect visit investigator contain another form .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study design compare efficacy topical ingenol mebutate ( 150 mcg/g daily select facial scalp target area 25 cm2 , 3 consecutive day ) cryosurgery ( apply freeze time 5 second , lesion include area 25 cm2 face scalp ) This national , post-marketing ( phase 4 ) , label , interventional , randomized trial . Subjects attend screen visit assess eligibility . Two area treatment patient identify ( e.g . scalp cheek two different part bald scalp ) , two area randomize 2:1 ratio : one treat cryosurgery one Picato Gel . The cryosurgery perform day visit ( 1 application freeze time 5 second , lesion include area 25 cm2 face scalp ) Picato gel 150 mcg apply home patient , accord current indication ( RCP : 3 consecutive day total three application area 25 cm2 ) Subjects follow 24 week ( 6 month ) cryosurgery application ( Visit 1 ) . Adverse event patient compliance record 7 day cryosurgery application 5 day first Picato gel application ( Visit 2 ) . The number AKs present within treatment area count Visit 1 ( Baseline AK count ) Visits 3 - 4 ( AKcount ) . The data obtain provide information effect Picato gel versus Cryosurgery recurrence rate AKs . Furthermore , trial also provide data effect Picato gel versus Cryosurgery appearance rate new AKs . The final result subject include Final Clinical Study Report original submission . This include final result primary secondary endpoint well 6-month recurrence Adverse Event data .</detailed_description>
