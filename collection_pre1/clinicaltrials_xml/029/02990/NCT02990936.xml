	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine impact tumor growth velocity survival patient oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma treat ( chemo- ) radiotherapy . Patients stag I IV oropharyngeal primary squamous cell carcinoma ( OPSCC ) elect radiotherapy radiochemotherapy curative intent select . Tumor volume number size pathological neck lymph node ( small diameter &gt; 1 cm ) assess diagnostic CT-scan ( DiCT ) treatment plan CT-scan ( RtCT ) use summation area technique . Tumor progression tumor double time calculate base DiCT RtCT . Tumor proliferation assess biopsy specimen Ki67 immunohistochemistry mitotic index . HPV status evaluate PCR p16 immunohistochemistry . Ulcerative exophytic aspect notice . Tumoral kinetics pattern correlate disease free survival overall survival patient OPSCC . These pattern compare HPV status proliferation marker order study clinical signification [ time frame : 5 year ] develop predictive marker tumor progression head neck cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prognostic Impact Tumor Growth Velocity Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma Treated Radio ( Chemo ) Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Head neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) represent 90 percent head neck tumor one frequent human neoplasm ( Jemal 2007 ) . During last decade , radiotherapy emerge standard treatment HNSCC number patient treated modality continuously increase . Moreover , treatment schedule radiotherapy improve require preparation therefore time consume . Thus , wait time prior radiotherapy become major concern many country report delay 70 day even more.Clinicians involve treat HNSCC face problem rapidly grow tumor despite significant progress understand tumor , development progression remain currently unpredictible time diagnosis . In retrospective trial , Laccourreye et al . studied time progression symptom sign ( TPSS ) diagnosis treatment 966 HNSCC case show give tumor stage , long TPSS , good vital prognosis , local lymph node control . But clear definition fast grow tumor , objective measurement . Oropharynx squamous cell carcinoma ( OPSCC ) , frequent HNSCC localization , mainly treat radiotherapy mostly present advanced stage . A CT-scan perfomed time diagnosis . Several week later , second CT-scan necessary treatment plan order define tumoral target volume . This necessity provide opportunity compare tumoral volume exams , thus assess tumoral progression . In pilot study conduct Institut Gustave Roussy , study retrospectively tumor loco-regional progression wait time diagnostic treatment plan CT-scans cohort patient oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma , treat radio ( chemo ) therapy April 2005 April 2007 . We demonstrate 53 % patient presented tumoral progression &gt; 50 % within mean wait time 42.1 +/- 15.7 day . We consider situation regrettable , prospective trial clearly need determine clinical consequence finding . The current project aim study prospectively loco-regional tumoral progression within wait time diagnostic treatment plan CT-scans cohort patient OPSCC . Patients oropharyngeal primary squamous cell carcinoma elect radiotherapy radiochemotherapy curative intent select . Tumor volume , number size pathological cervical lymph node ( small diameter &gt; 1 cm ) assess diagnostic CT-scan ( DiCT ) treatment plan CT-scan ( RtCT ) use summation area technique ( computerized delineation ) . Tumoral progression tumor double time calculate base DiCT RtCT order define different tumoral kinetics pattern . Human papillomavirus ( HPV ) status assessed polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) p16 immunohistochemistry . As primary objective , study tumoral kinetics pattern disease free survival ( DFS ) overall survival ( OS ) patient OPSCC order study clinical signification [ time frame : 5 year ] . As secondary objective , correlate tumoral kinetics pattern HPV status patient OPSCC , compare tumoural kinetics proliferation marker ( Ki67 , mitotic index ) order develop predictive marker tumour progression head neck cancer . An complementary objective compare tumor kinetics pattern endoscopic aspect ( ulcerative versus exophytic )</detailed_description>
