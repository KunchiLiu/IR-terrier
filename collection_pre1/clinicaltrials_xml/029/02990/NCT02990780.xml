	<brief_title>Accelerated Hypofractionated vs. Conventionally Fractionated Concurrent CRT LS-SCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Small-cell lung cancer account approximately 13 % lung cancer , one-third patient present limited stage SCLC diagnosis . Currently standard care LS-SCLC concurrent chemotherapy thoracic radiation therapy , prophylactic cranial irradiation achieve good response combine chemoradiotherapy , yield median survival 15 23 month 5-year survival rate 26 % . The optimal dose/fraction LS-SCLC remain debatable . For SCLC characteristic rapid double time high growth fraction , also evidence suggest prolonged interrupt overall radiation time contribute treatment failure poor outcome accelerate repopulation.In previous study also find overall radiation time might play important role treatment LS-SCLC patient treat high biologically effective dose ( BED , include time factor ) &gt; 57 Gy favorable local control survival . This randomise prospective phase III study base patient limited stage SCLC , define disease confine one hemithorax hilar , mediastinal , supraclavicular node without pleural effusion , safely encompass within tolerable radiation field . The purpose study add information current medical literature efficacy safety accelerate hypofractionated vs. conventionally fractionate concurrent chemo-radiotherapy limited-stage SCLC . Patients randomize two group . The control group undergo induction chemotherapy follow conventionally fractionate concurrent chemo-radiotherapy.The experimental group receive induction chemotherapy follow accelerate hypofractionated concurrent chemo-radiotherapy.The investigator compare overall survival ( OS ) two group .</detailed_description>
