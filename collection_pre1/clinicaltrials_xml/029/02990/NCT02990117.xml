	<brief_summary>The introduction inhale medication primary treatment asthma lead substantial improvement asthma control [ 1 , 2 ] . However , uncontrolled asthma still common represent considerable burden patient society [ 3 , 4 ] . An important reason poor asthma control consequently , increase healthcare expenditure suboptimal adherence prescribe regimen [ 5-7 ] . Real-world market research study hospital across China report physician perceive 23 % patient fully compliant medication regime ( 77 % non-adherent ) , compare 55 % European Union 63 % US [ AZ internal document ] . The physician report rate full adherence lower patient-reported rate ( 38 % ) . Poor patient adherence challenge frequently mention ( 41 % physician ) treat asthma . [ 8 ] However There evidence driver patient behaviour around low adherence depth research need There little evidence variation determinant asthma inhaled treatment across different age group Our research aim address data gap Mean research guide development new module Red Scarf patient education program .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study site ( ) number subject plan 8 level-3 hospital across West China participate study . 40 well control asthma patient participate structure interview stage1 total number 300 patient expect participate cross sectional survey stage 2 . Study period Estimated Time CSP approve Oct. 2016 First subject Jan. 2017 Last subject Aug. 2017 Database lock Dec. 2017 CSR Mar . 2017 Study design It study include 2 stage , stage 1 structured patient interview investigator , Stage 2 multi-center , cross-sectional survey . 40 eligible asthma patient and/or family supporter invite participate one-time face face structure interview stage 1 . Around 350 eligible asthma patient invite participate cross sectional survey Information relevant data compliance inhale treatment therapy response measurement compliance risk factor ( determinant explore stage 1 ) collect accord CRF , inputted on-line electronic questionnaire data capture ( EDC ) system site investigator ( ) , valid data take statistical analysis . Target subject population Stage 1 : Asthmatic patient adequate asthma control ( define GINA partly un-control due inhale treatment compliance ( physician judgement ) Stage 2 : Asthmatic patient visit outpatient clinic interview investigator . Objectives Stage 1 : Primary Objective : Outcome Measure : Non- Assumptive Deep Dive Qualitative Scoping investigate determinant poor adherence ICS treatment structure interview &amp; taskforce workshop Decide key measure phase2 survey steer committee group review . Categorized `` risk factor '' ( patient behavior/belief , social status , medical care availability etc . ) likely lead poor patient adherence inhale treatment adherence partly uncontrolled asthma patient 1 . Therapy related factor 2 . Patient related factor 3 . Provider related factor 4 . Disease relate factor 5 . Practice system related factor Questionnaire measure asthma patient adherence determinant survey stage 2 Stage 2 : Primary Objective : Outcome Measure : To investigate relationship different risk factor ( determinant explore stage 1 ) treatment adherence identify top 5 determinant closely relative inhalation treatment adherence Decide key measure phase2 survey steer committee group review . Asthma patient compliance level Inhaled treatment ( ICS ICS/LABA ) use validate MARS-A scale questionnaire . Risk factor ( determinant explore stage 1 ) measurement response asthma patient Secondary Objective : Outcome Measure : Similar objective deferent life-stage group asthma patient . Similar analysis different life-stage group patient ( 18- 30 , 31-45,45-60 , 60+ ) Statistical method - All result describe . In general , descriptive statistic ( number , mean , median , standard deviation , minimum maximum ) present continuous variable . The frequency percentage subject level category present categorical variable . Where appropriate , 95 % confidence interval construct . - Risk factor analysis perform use univariate multivariate regression model explore relationship risk factor compliance level . In addition multivariate analysis use variable , step-wise variable selection use . The level variable inclusion exclusion set 0.15 . The important variable ( ) force model applicable .</detailed_description>
