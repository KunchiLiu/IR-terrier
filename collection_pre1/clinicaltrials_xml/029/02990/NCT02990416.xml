	<brief_summary>This study evaluate effectiveness add single four-day treatment fusion protein A-dmDT390-bisFv ( UCHT1 ) — plus single palliative tumor radiation — standard care KEYTRUDA ( Pembrolizumab ) therapy treatment metastatic melanoma . The result measure compare combine therapy historical data KEYTRUDA alone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A-dmDT390-bisFv ( UCHT1 ) Fusion Protein With Ionizing Radiation Pembrolizumab Treatment Stage IV Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose trial test hypothesis A-dmDT390-bisFv ( UCHT1 ) act immunomodulator late stage metastatic melanoma combine palliative radiation ( induce prim activated T cell tumor antigen ) Pembrolizumab . A-dmDT390-bisFv ( UCHT1 ) , anti-T cell immunotoxin currently study treatment cutaneous T cell lymphoma CD3+ malignant disease ( NCT00611208 NCT02943642 ) . During course study , data accumulate A-dmDT390-bisFv ( UCHT1 ) could act immunomodulator . This base observation four six partial response convert complete response time range 6 24 month follow completion 4-day treatment protocol ( serum half life ~45 min . ) treatment take place . Complete response duration 4-6+ year . Checkpoint inhibitor revolutionize treatment certain solid tumor , notably melanoma , NSCLC renal cancer . Yet overall response rate remain low mechanism limit response elucidate . Based finding checkpoint inhibitor high response rate tumor neoantigen burden high ( 1 mutation per megabase , Shumacher &amp; Schreiber , 2015 ) investigator propose increase neoantigen burden combine two distinct manipulation : 1 . Treatment anti-CD3 fusion protein Resimmune day 1-4 induce 20-fold increase CD8+ central memory T cell 2 . Treatment anti-PD1 day 16 q . 3 week block PD-1/PD-L1 negative regulation newly activate T cell ( Blake et al. , 2015 ) block high level PD-1 tumor microenvironment ( Ahmadzadeh et al. , 2009 ) . Palliative tumor radiation day 5 provide tumor antigen release need convert expanded central memory T cell effector memory T cell . The study single-arm , uncontrolled phase I/II trial estimate safely combine treatment estimate efficacy term RECIST 1.1 patient stage Stage IV metastatic melanoma . The primary endpoint clinical response define progression-free survival ( PFS ) . The second end point tolerability treatment . Secondary end point consider overall survival ( OS ) . The study conduct 2 phase . In phase I ( safety ) , investigator enroll 6 patient . In first stage , 25 total patient enrol . Using Simon 's two stage minimax design phase II trial , investigator plan enroll maximum 63 patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All patient must histologically prove stage IV metastatic melanoma consist least two lesion &gt; = 1.5 cm would occupy radiation field . Patients must treatment naïve except treatment BRAF inhibitor . Patients melanoma must antiDT titer &lt; 20 μg/ml . Patients brain metastasis ocular mucosal lesion enrol discretion PI provide nonbrain nonocular metastatic lesion available target radiation therapy Patients must performance status &lt; 2 Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group scale ( see Appendix ) . Patients must fully recover toxicity prior therapy BRAF inhibitor . Adequate bone marrow function define ANC &gt; 750 uL , WBC &gt; 1000 uL , platelet &gt; 60,000 uL Hb &gt; 9g/dL Patients must : bilirubin &lt; 1.5 mg/dL , transaminases &lt; 2.5 X ULN , albumin &gt; 3 gm/dL , creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dL , adequate pulmonary function physical exam pulse oximetry adequate cardiac reserve ( EF &gt; 50 % normal ) . Patients must normal echocardiogram without evidence cardiac chamber hypertrophy , dilatation hypokinesis . The Sponsor must provide copy test Sponsor approve enrollment . In addition , sponsor must receive list current medication take patient Sponsor approve enrollment . Patients must give write informed consent prior registration ( see Informed Consent ) . Females male must willing use approve form birth control study 2 week completion . Patients age 1880 eligible provide stage IV melanoma negative BRAF fail BRAF inhibitor treatment fail intolerant establish therapy know provide clinical benefit condition adequately consent agreed forgo FDA approve clinically meaningful therapy . Failure meet criterion set forth Inclusion Criteria . Inability give inform consent psychiatric problem , complicate medical problem . Serious concurrent medical problem , uncontrolled infection , disseminate intravascular coagulopathy ( DIC ) . Preexisting cardiovascular disease , exception well control essential hypertension sit B.P . &lt; 155 systolic &lt; 90 diastolic without evidence structural heart disease one episode myocardial infarction &gt; 8 month ago .

Referring physician ask verify refer patient exclusionary history list 3.2 copy verification must send Sponsor Sponsor approve enrollment . Because betablockers associated adverse event anaphylactic reaction reaction occur IV infusion proteins study drug , sponsor require patient receive betablockers hypertension convert another antihypertensive reagent 23 week prior receive study drug . Angiotensin inhibitor , angiotensin receptor blocker calcium channel blocker acceptable . Pregnant nursing woman exclude study . History congestive heart failure . History cirrhosis liver . Prior treatment alemtuzumab ( Campath ) similar agent procedure depress blood T cell count 50 % low limit normal .</criteria>
