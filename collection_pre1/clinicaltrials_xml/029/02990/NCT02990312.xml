	<brief_summary>The purpose proof concept , pilot study determine whether unique combination human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) co-receptor antagonist , Maraviroc , mammalian target rapamycin ( mTOR ) inhibitor , Sirolimus , HIV-infected kidney transplant recipient impact chemokine receptor 5 ( CCR5 ) density , HIV-reservoir , rejection transplant kidney . 15 HIV-infected kidney transplant recipient recruit immunosuppressant regimen change include mTOR inhibitor ( Sirolimus ) unless already one . In addition , Maraviroc add HIV regimen , unless already Maraviroc . Blood take measure marker HIV reservoir , CCR5 density expression , immune activation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study pilot , prospective , single-center , open-label , non-randomized , non-controlled clinical trial . 15 HIV-infected kidney transplant recipient enrol study . Recruitment conduct renal transplant infectious disease outpatient clinic University Maryland . The study include patient stable glomerular filtration rate ( GFRs ) &gt; 25 suppressed HIV CD4 count &gt; 200 . These patient recruit University Maryland 's transplant nephrology infectious disease clinic . The transplant nephrology clinic multidisciplinary clinic incorporates nephrologists , pharmacist aid medication management , coordinator assist patient coordination care . All patient screen either Institute Human Virology ( IHV ) Clinical Research Unit transplant nephrology infectious disease clinic . At visit , patient sign informed consent approve institutional review board ( IRB ) , history physical examination , screen clinical research lab drawn . Additional requirement Trofile test prior enrollment . Eligibility determine base upon result . Study drug prescribe ( patient already take ) start day 0 interval history physical examination perform safety lab ( pregnancy test woman childbearing potential ) check . The medication fill patient 's pharmacy , use insurance Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve drug . Patients initially monitor weekly sirolimus level renal function , sirolimus pre-determined ( transplant nephrologist ) steady state . They follow week 4 , every 12 week new medication combination . Safety lab ( blood count , renal liver function ) , HIV viral load , cluster differentiation 4 ( CD4 ) count , rapamycin level review visit check within specified time period lab repeat study visit . Patients also advise study adherence monitor adverse event . Safety adverse event monitoring occur study visit . Research nurse inquire adverse event may may relate study drug . Any unfavorable medical occurrence record , whether consider related patient 's participation research temporally associate patient 's participation research . Any grade 3 4 AEs serious adverse event ( SAEs ) review occur study team . Adverse event ( AEs ) classify grade 3 high occurring frequency great expect study team report IRB principal investigator . The end treatment visit occur week 96 . Clinical safety lab ( blood count , renal liver function ) , HIV viral load , CD4 count rapamycin level perform visit do pre-specified time period . Patients give option , conjunction transplant nephrologist infectious disease provider , discontinue continue new medication time .</detailed_description>
