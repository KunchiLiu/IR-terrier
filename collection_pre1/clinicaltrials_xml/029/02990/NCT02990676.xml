	<detailed_description>Due space constraint extensive description research study find study protocol . 1 . Background Rationale Huntington 's disease ( HD ) cause CAG repeat trinucleotide expansion within first exon huntingtin gene cause range symptom include motor , cognitive psychiatric disturbance , significantly affect daily activity , independence quality life , even early stage disease . Cognitive dysfunction early HD disease process well document include specific problem attention , cognitive flexibility memory . Indeed , difficulty share attention one task demonstrate specific core deficit HD . Cognitive training intervention , focus executive function , present potentially exciting non-pharmacological treatment option neurodegenerative disease include HD . Studies HD mouse previously demonstrate executive function impairment , include deficit attention subsequent study show cognitive training benefit HD mouse prevent onset cognitive motor disease symptom . This work suggest early cognitive training intervention significant long-lasting beneficial effect HD symptom . Although systematic study mouse model HD require inform translational aspect cognitive training intervention , result provide important proof principle evidence cognitive training provide benefit mouse model HD . Studies human population suggest cognitive training , via repeatedly conduct task require specific aspect executive function attention , reason memory , improve cognitive function people age . Computerised cognitive training study also conduct number neurodegenerative disease include Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . These study find computerised cognitive training improve cognition PD AD . However , systematic literature review Europe PubMed Central use keywords , 'Huntington 's disease ' 'cognitive training ' 'cognitive therapy ' 'brain training ' 'executive function training ' conduct year 1950 2015 , produce 2 result . A review cognitive burden HD paper exercise mouse model HD benefit cognitive symptom . Thus , use cognitive training HD considerably research area knowledge cognitive training yet explore HD . Therefore , feasibility study , one propose application crucial trialing novel potential therapeutic intervention . The outcome measure use determine patient benefit cognitive training study vary significantly study . Furthermore , first time intervention use people HD . Therefore , outcome measure use cognitive training study determine patient benefit need carefully explore defined prior begin study . The candidate outcome measure use study choose include cognitive motor measure specific people HD best evaluate outcome intervention . Difficulty share attention show specific problem HD . Attentional sharing measure clinically use dual task participant require two task time . The two task modality walk carry tray , different modality walk combined cognitive component counting . Dual task study show people HD reduce attentional sharing capacity , particularly dual task cognitive element . As ability complete dual task increase attentional demand key skill everyday life , deficit task severely affect independence , increase risk fall reduce quality life . The propose study use dual task performance ass feasibility , acceptability gather preliminary efficacy data effect cognitive training intervention people HD . Environmental enrichment show improve disease symptom HD mice retrospective study regard lifestyle people HD suggest passive sedentary lifestyle , lack enrich activity , may contribute early onset disease symptom . There also preliminary evidence motor training produce functional benefit HD accumulate evidence feasibility functional improvement in- out-patient exercise rehabilitation programme . Motor train exercise study show multi-modal exercise intervention well tolerate associated improvement movement , cognition mood alongside increase health relate quality life .

Participants ask complete range computer paper base cognitive task , motor task interview first research visit , may coincide ENROLL-HD visit . Participants invite back complete baseline assessment feasibility study within next 4 week . After randomisation , allocate intervention group receive 12-week home-based cognitive training intervention , support home visit email telephone reminder , preferred . Those allocated control group ask continue normal although also receive home visit . At 6 week optional MRI scan conduct addition cognitive task . 12 week complete baseline assessment , participant invite back complete final outcome assessment . 4 . Participant Selection The Cardiff HD Centre Enroll-HD ( previously Registry ) site many patient attend clinic enrol study ( REC . 04/WSE05/89 ) . Patients already enrol global Enroll-HD observational study invite take part study . The progression symptoms Enroll-HD participant monitor longitudinally . One optional component within Enroll-HD study give permission participant contact additional affiliated HD research study , cod data access researcher conduct HD related research . As , full clinical data set include full medical medication history available research participant data may use study . In addition , investigator would like gather view family member , friends carers . Participants ask provide consent investigator talk family member , friend carer , may attend research visit participant , involvement study . If informed consent obtain , via participant date consent form , family member , friend carer invite interview study . 5 . Recruitment 5.1 . Number Participants This initial proof principle study ; thus formal sample size calculation complete . The investigator aim recruit 50 participant target randomise 40 participant . The suggested number base previous literature regard cognitive training disease consider MRI optional component study . The study team fund MRI scan 16 participant study , scan conduct first come first serve basis fund scan use participant able scan . This study essential step towards large systematic study cognitive training inform design delivery trial , well provide data inform power calculation estimate sample size future . 5.2 . Recruitment Process Potential participant , already consent participate ENROLL-HD may approach clinical visit inform study . Potential participant receive information sheet study give sufficient time ask question discuss study researcher . If require , potential participant take information sheet home discus study family friend . Potential participant wish consent remind change mind withdraw without reason time . If potential participant willing proceed study , ask sign consent form study assessment begin . 5.3 . Informed Consent The participant allow much time need consider Participant Information Sheet ( PIS ) opportunity question research team independent party decide whether he/she participate study . All participant procedure explain detail , include study design randomise , MRI scan optional component withdraw time . Informed consent obtain mean participant dated signature date signature person present obtain informed consent . The original signed form retain study site . After informed consent receive first study visit take place . Participants remind withdraw study time , without need give reason affect current future care . Participants ask consent process family member carer ask opinion cognitive training intervention , optional component consent form . If consent provide ask family member , friends carers attend clinic participant , ask read separate information sheet . If agree participate , ask sign consent form interview regard study . 5.4 . Health Checks/Screening Required Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) Scanning MRI scan optional component study . Thus , part pre-screening process , participant screen contraindication MRI . In addition , comprehensive screening MRI contraindication complete immediately MRI scan researcher MRI operator participant allow scanning room . 5.5 . Randomisation Procedures As study include intervention control group , randomisation perform use minimisation procedure programme ensure balance group categorical variable age cognitive function . Minimisation perform researcher , consider age cognitive result recently publish global ENROLL-HD study data . Age cognitive function give weight minimisation procedure . Age classify two category : 1 ) &lt; 45 year 2 ) &gt; 45 year . The total cognitive score participant Montreal Cognitive Assessment , use classify participant two category . The randomisation procedure carefully explain potential research participant specifically outline PIS CF . Randomisation perform participant sign CF complete initial baseline assessment . Participants allocate control group ask carry normal . Once allocate group , participant receive allocation letter detail group randomise . Unfortunately , due licence restriction allocate control group able use cognitive training software first research visit baseline outcome assessment second third research visit . It make clear potential participant end study , stop use cognitive training software access login system expire . 6 . Study Procedures 6.1 The 12-week Cognitive Training Intervention The 12-week cognitive training intervention complete participant home . The intervention support email , text telephone reminder ( prefer participant detailed Case Report Form ) home visit . Home visit conduct active control group , twice first 4 week , second 4 week complete final 4 week , assess impact visit adherence programme . Although additional home visit may necessary participant concern use software . During research visit , active group , researcher ensure participant comfortable software , offer support guidance battery cognitive assessment perform . For control group home visit researcher complete cognitive test battery talk participant day . The intervention design conduct minimal supervision something explore participant friend , family member carer interview . When complete home visit , researcher comply Lone Workers Policy existence Cardiff HD Centre discuss visit research team prior complete ensure safety compromised time . Participants ask complete training programme provide use HAPPYneuron software minimum 30 minute 5 time week 12 week . After participant completes 30 minute train programme free complete 'games ' available HAPPYneuron computerise cognitive training software . Completion cognitive training programme monitor support use email telephone reminder ( preferred participant ) home visit researcher . This allow patient adherence cognitive intervention programme monitor therefore feasibility acceptability programme participant explore . Each participant provide unique log . The software provide interface allow researcher track regularity use progress study participant . Therefore , investigator able remotely determine often long participant use software analyse participant performance cognitive task . Furthermore , performance participant specific task , cognitive training session measure used determine improvement specific cognitive task , example response accuracy response time , throughout study . Participants make aware researcher able see training activity throughout study . The cognitive training software investigator plan use study easy use , automate , provide non-biased data recording , provide interface allow researcher track compliance remotely . It previously validate healthy control patient depression , show patient benefit include improve cognition functionality . At end study participant login detail expire longer able access cognitive training software , make clear PIS . The intervention design complete independently , although feasibility study , agreement participant , investigator specifically explore involvement friend , family member carers use semi-structured interview begin end study . 6.2 . Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) Scanning Cardiff University world lead brain imaging research centre ( CUBRIC ) provide access state art research facility equipment . Therefore , MRI scan use study , optional component , great explore biological effect , cognitive training programme may . Prior consent , potential participant screen contradiction MRI . Further screening conduct prior MRI scanning procedure . MRI scan optional component feasibility study , therefore participant want undergo MRI scanning procedure , still able take part study . Participants also make aware free withdraw MRI scan component study time , without need give reason affect care receive . If participant consent MRI , MRI scan procedure carefully explain discussed participant participant opportunity experience 'mock ' MRI scanner , feel may helpful . The MRI scan conduct research visit 6 week intervention . An MRI scan conduct fully trained MR Operator help researcher MR safety train . The scan acquire 3T Siemens Prisma scanner 32 head coil . The MRI scan protocol include scan assess structural scan ass gross macrostructure , microstructural scan assess white matter myelination change well quantitative fMRI measure rest cerebral blood flow . The complete scanning protocol expect last long 90 minute , lead participant ensure comfortable throughout scan procedure . 7 . Data Collection For majority assessment procedure , data collect paper data collection form result test subsequently transfer secure online database . The data online database verify paper form ensure data integrity . Original data collection sheet file store securely TMF . For semi-structured interview , question ask orally researcher , audio record transcribed verbatim . Although flexibility may necessary avoid need protocol amendment . A list topic include interview schedule participant family member , friends carers attend research visit participant include : - How intervention perceived/was receive ? - Expected perceived impact daily routine - Expected perceived impact family members/ carers - Overall expectation - Expected perceived acceptability ( support help require ) - Thoughts view randomisation procedure - Potential barrier complete intervention - General view comment cognitive training intervention 8 . Data Analysis As propose study feasibility study use computerise cognitive training people HD , study formally power . The primary aim feasibility , eligibility , recruitment acceptability study evaluate . Adherence propose cognitive training intervention adverse effect also report . Therefore , crucial inference make allow estimation parameter inform definitive future trial specific patient population . 8.1 . Statistical Analyses Summary statistic demographic ( age , gender , height weight ) disease burden score report . Descriptive data include evaluation eligibility , recruitment , retention rate acceptability , adherence intervention , 95 % confidence interval . The completion outcome measure assessment also report . Graphical illustration use check distribution outcome data . Successful adherence intervention define complete 12 week computerise cognitive training minimum 3 , 30 minute session per week . This feasibility study ; thus estimation retention rate may difficult small sample size . Therefore , suggest retention rate great 75 % , investigator consider intervention feasible . If proportion retain less great 65 % , investigator consider adjust intervention increase future investigation . The qualitative work help establish retention rate end study . A retention rate lower would require substantial change intervention therefore would require pilot feasibility study . Changes outcome assessment analyze use analysis covariance ( ANCOVA ) baseline score variable addition balance variable ( age UHDRS TMS ) covariates . Data collection perform via HAPPYneuron software system initially data collection form transfer database . Data completeness monitor point collection ; therefore , investigator expect large amount miss data . As intention inform future confirmatory trial , investigator explore feasibility outcome apply trial population . The investigator consider internal reliability outcome measure , previously use HD apply computerised cognitive training intervention . 9 .
