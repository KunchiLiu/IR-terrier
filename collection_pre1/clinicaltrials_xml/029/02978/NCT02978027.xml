More 50 % alcohol health consequence occur risky , non-dependent drinker . Increasing efficacy efficiency brief intervention medical setting could significantly reduce public health impact risky drinking . Despite overall positive finding brief intervention , high level variability effect , meta-analyses report significant unexplained heterogeneity outcome likely account difference intervention component strategy . There intense interest conduct motivational interviewing ( MI ) inform brief intervention risky alcohol use medical setting , little empirical information available regard MI behavioral interpersonal style component drive effectiveness . Following promise efficacy trial counsel application , MI translate brief ( 5-15 minute ) interaction subject randomize control trial methodology . Lack mixed-methods , Stage 1 treatment development evidence inability provide consistent delineation key intervention component mechanisms action . Variability factor likely responsible wide variability effect observe meta-analyses brief intervention . Many MI skill behavior require significant training supervision increase patient-provider interaction time .
