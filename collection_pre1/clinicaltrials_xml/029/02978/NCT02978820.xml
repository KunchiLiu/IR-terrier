	<brief_summary>Scoliosis specific exercise show improve curve progression study compare different exercise approach adolescent idiopathic scoliosis ( AIS ) . The objective study compare effect Core stabilization ( CS ) exercise Scientific Exercises Approach Scoliosis ( SEAS exercise ) addition brace wear patient AIS . It important compare different exercise method different aspect scoliotic deformity , curve progression , angle trunk rotation , body symmetry , cosmetic trunk deformity , satisfaction treatment quality life .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Comparison Core Stabilization Exercise With Scientific Exercise Approach Scoliosis Idiopathic Scoliosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim study investigate whether adolescent idiopathic scoliosis receive scoliosis specific exercise approach , SEAS exercise , accordance brace approach moderate curve would great improvement curve progression , trunk deformity , body symmetry quality life adolescent receive exercise therapy base general core stabilization approach similar intensity . Thirty female patient AIS age 12 to16 year , moderate curve ( 20 45 degree ) randomly divide two group . One group receive CS exercise , receive SEAS exercise forty-min weekly four month . Both group undergo full-time bracing ( 23 hour per day ) intervention . Outcome base Cobb angle , angle trunk rotation , body symmetry ( Posterior Trunk Symmetry Index ) , cosmetic trunk deformity ( Walter Reed Visual Assessment Scale ) quality life ( Scoliosis Research Society - 22 Questionnaire ) measure baseline intervention period . Results analyze use paired sample t-test compare repeat measurement independent sample t-test compare group .</detailed_description>
