	<brief_title>Trans-spinal Direct Current Stimulation Primary Orthostatic Tremor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Regain function improvement motor skill major challenge motor disorder spinal cord function play key role . The grow development non-invasive brain stimulation past decade lead significant progress understand neuronal abnormality patient movement disorder open new vista experimental treatment . However , treatment currently limit due high cost lack possibility use outpatient . Recently , trans-spinal direct current stimulation ( tsDCS ) emerge novel tool modulate non-invasively spinal cord excitability . This may excellent alternative epidural stimulation , sole technique available alter spinal function invasive fashion . The overall goal study assess potential tsDCS restore spinal cord function patient primary orthostatic tremor ( POT ) , disorder little current therapeutic resource high disability patient . Using crossover , randomize , double-blinded approach , cathodal ( 2mA , 20 min ) sham tsDCS ( active electrode thoracic level reference electrode right shoulder ) deliver 15 patient POT . The maximal time upright position determine force platform , cortical excitability assess transcranial magnetic stimulation ( input / output curve tibialis anterior muscle short-latency afferent inhibition ) EMG activity low extremity muscle measure ( PRE ) , immediately 30 minute current offset ( POST0 POST30 respectively ) . Cathodal sham tsDCS deliver two different session washout period least 7 day . The investigator anticipate cathodal tsDCS sham tsDCS able modulate sensory motor function POT , turn , lead functional improvement .</detailed_description>
