	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well talimogene laherparepvec work nivolumab treat patient lymphomas respond treatment non-melanoma skin cancer spread place body respond treatment . Biological therapy , talimogene laherparepvec , use substance make live organism may stimulate suppress immune system different way stop tumor cell grow . Monoclonal antibody , nivolumab , may block protein need tumor cell grow spread . Giving talimogene laherparepvec nivolumab may work well treat patient lymphomas non-melanoma skin cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Talimogene Laherparepvec Nivolumab Treating Patients With Refractory Lymphomas Advanced Refractory Non-melanoma Skin Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine frequency patient respond ( response rate ) talimogene laherparepvec ( T-VEC ) monotherapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine local response rate T-VEC inject tumor . II . To determine response rate T-VEC + nivolumab ( NIVO ) . III . To identify potential pre-treatment on-treatment correlative biomarkers local systemic immune response . OUTLINE : Patients receive talimogene laherparepvec intratumorally ( IT ) day 1 . Patients without response week 12 , may also receive nivolumab intravenously ( IV ) 60 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 14 day 1 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 12 week 3 year .</detailed_description>
