	<brief_summary>This study aim improve continence patient spinal cord injury use electrical stimulation . The Finetech Vocare Bladder System implantable sacral nerve stimulator improve bladder bowel function patient spinal cord injury ( SCI ) . It commercially available Britain country since 1982 , use thousand patient SCI improve bladder , bowel sexual function . It receive FDA approval 1998 Humanitarian Device Exemption H980005 H980008 provide urination demand aid bowel evacuation . Electrical stimulation produce bladder contraction improve bladder void spinal cord injury usually combine cut sensory nerve reduce reflex contraction bladder , improve continence . However , cut nerve undesirable side effect . This study cut sensory nerve . This study test use stimulator inhibit bladder contraction stimulate sensory nerve improve continence spinal cord injury .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Human subject recruit VA Palo Alto Health Care System people clinically complete spinal cord injury . Subjects meet selection criterion describe screened identify whose reflex bladder contraction inhibit neuromodulation use low level electrical stimulation via electrode skin dorsal genital nerve . Serial filling cystometries perform clinical urodynamic laboratory Spinal Cord Injury Service VA Palo Alto . Bladder capacity compliance record cytometrogram . Subjects whose reflex bladder contraction significantly inhibit neuromodulation offer enrollment trial . Subjects whose reflex bladder contraction significantly inhibit neuromodulation , wish participate study , able continue usual form bladder management . After screen , select subject offer surgical implantation Vocare Bladder System FDA-approved manner , without posterior rhizotomy . Because posterior rhizotomy perform , afferent axon sacral nerve intact stimulate surgery via electrode connect implanted stimulator . The Vocare Bladder System implant FDA-approved manner without posterior rhizotomy . After implantation , subject evaluate urodynamic laboratory . Stimulation apply S34 sacral nerve bilaterally , effect bladder capacity continence measure . Continence urine document bladder diary . These diary complete initially inpatient SCI Service home apply neuromodulation via implant . It expect sacral neuromodulation method associate significant increase bladder capacity continence . It possible neuromodulation associate increase bladder capacity continence . If , subject still able use conventional method manage continence loss function . Participants whose bladder capacity continence improve neuromodulation use implanted stimulator offer opportunity continue use stimulator duration study review three-month interval . At end study review usual clinician contra-indications continue use stimulator offer opportunity continue use continue clinical follow-up usual clinician . Participants whose bladder capacity continence improve neuromodulation use implanted stimulator , wish continue use implant stimulator , review usual clinician offer bladder management use prior study . The implanted stimulator switch , remove unless participant wish remove investigator participant 's usual clinician consider participant 's interest remove . It usually simpler safer participant leave stimulator implanted inactive . All participant provide appropriate documentation regard safety electromagnetic compatibility device . The investigation justify potential benefit great potential risk , follow : The potential benefit research subject : 1 . Improved bladder capacity 2 . Improved continence The potential benefit research others : Evidence bladder capacity continence spinal cord injury improve electrical stimulation without cut nerve . The risks subject reasonable relation anticipate benefit subject others 1 . The high prevalence severity clinical complication cause bladder complication spinal cord injury 2 . The paucity method restore continence spinal cord injury safe , effective without undesirable side effect This study primarily aim demonstrate safety , feasibility proof concept . It may also produce statistically clinically significant evidence efficacy use plan future clinical trial . Significance : If technique reduce reflex bladder contraction implant stimulation S34 nerve bilaterally successful , open door effective use neuromodulation continence spinal cord injury .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects include meet follow criterion : Complete spinal cord injury ( AIS grade A ) least 2 year duration neurological level ( ISNCSCI level ) C4 Impaired bladder empty due Detrusor External Sphincter DyssynergiaDESD ( uncoordinated contraction bladder external urethral sphincter ) show videourodynamic testing . The criterion DESD diagnosis presence open bladder neck without stress incontinence , close external urethral sphincter fill void phase fluoroscopic assist urodynamic study . Impaired continence due detrusor hyperreflexia Subjects exclude meet follow criterion : Absence reflex contraction bladder show urodynamic test Absence reflex contraction external urethral sphincter show urodynamic test EMG External sphincterotomy , urethral stricture previous urethral sphincter bladder prostate surgery History pelvic fracture Subjects anticoagulant coagulation disorder Immunosuppressed subject Active recurrent pressure ulcer , particularly sacral , ischial trochanteric area Active untreated infection Active implant medical device cardiac pacemaker defibrillator Progressive spinal cord injury Pregnancy Mechanical ventilator dependency Any significant comorbidity illness would preclude participation increase risk participate study Inability unwillingness follow study protocol give inform consent</criteria>
