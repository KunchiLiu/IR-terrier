	<brief_summary>Long hour daily sit lack Physical Activity ( PA ) risk factor morbidity mortality . People movement disability , include adolescent Cerebral Palsy ( CP ) tend lead sedentary life styl poor physical fitness . Adolescents CP find inactive day thus , great risk disease general population . In addition , year , people disability experience physical functional deterioration . Reducing sedentary behavior increase daily activity reduce health risk factor among adolescent CP , reduce secondary impairment preserve function . Interventions include exercise alone result physical activity participate structure training continue cessation intervention . The objective study establish effective program aim promote active life style among adolescent young adult CP evaluate outcome . Specific objectives- Stage 1- Identifying barrier facilitator reduce sedentary behavior increase physical activity among adolescent young adult CP . As well , identify mediator , need preference reduce sedentary behavior increase physical activity among adolescent young adult CP . Stage 2- Based stage 1- Establishing intervention reduce sedentary behavior increase physical activity among adolescent . Stage 3- translate develop questioner study . - Translating ASK-Performance ASK-Capability questionnaire Hebrew validate Hebrew translation . - Developing self-efficacy perception questioner increase physical activity reduce sedentary behavior . - Translating Hebrew , adjust validate activity diary . Stage 4- evaluate effectiveness propose intervention program reduce sedentary behavior increase physical activity among adolescent young adult CP .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Stage 1 focus group- Identifying barrier facilitator reduce sedentary behavior increase physical activity well , identify mediator , need preference reduce sedentary behavior increase physical activity . Stage 2- Based stage 1- Establishing intervention reduce sedentary behavior increase physical activity among adolescent . The intervention group receive behavior-modification group . The control group get physical exercises.Stage 3- translate develop questioner study . - Translating ASK-Performance ASK-Capability questionnaire Hebrew validate Hebrew translation . - Developing self-efficacy perception questioner increase physical activity reduce sedentary behavior . - Translating Hebrew , adjust validate activity diary . Stage 4- evaluate effectiveness propose intervention program reduce sedentary behavior increase physical activity among adolescent young adult CP . The outcome measure measure change base line intervention 4-6 month intervention finish . All partner project obtain approval experiment human subject local committee . Each subject ( parents/guardians participation minor subject ) able sign inform voluntary consent form , consistent Helsinki Declaration , read detailed explanation oral Q/A session investigator . Recruitment : Prospective focus direct mail personal contact initiate parents/guardians child CP ambulatory , see physiotherapist social group school . Inclusion exclusion criterion Focus Groups : - 30 adolescent Cerebral Palsy - age 14-25yrs - mobility level GMFCS I , II &amp; III - 20 Typically Developed individual age group - verbal ability suitable discussion - Cognitive level sufficient comprehend cooperate measurement . - Parent individual ( 18 ) agree participate study Exclusion criterion : - Unstable medical situation - Progressive degenerative condition Central Nervous System ( CNS ) musculoskeletal system . Inclusion exclusion criterion intervention group : - adolescent young adult bilateral spastic CP - GMFCS level I , II III - age 14-25 yr - speak native language fluently - able follow verbal instruction - willing train group . The exclusion criterion : adolescent young adult orthopedic surgery tone reduction intervention ( e.g . botulinum toxin injection , history baclofen pump selective dorsal rhizotomy ) within 6 month prior study - exercise induced asthma cardiac problem . Inclusion criterion validation ASK &amp; Self Efficiency Questionnaire study : - 30 Children adolescent CP - age 5-20yrs - GMFCS I ; II ; III . - Cognitive level sufficient comprehend cooperate measurement . - Parent subject ( 18 ) agree participate study Exclusion criterion : - Unstable medical situation - Progressive degenerative condition CNS musculoskeletal system Outcome measurement : 1 . Habitual Physical Activity ( HPA ) .Physical activity record use `` ActivPAL3™ '' ( PAL Technologies , Glasgow , UK ) tri-axial accelerometer-based activity monitor . 2 . 6 min walk test ( 6minWT ) : This test measure self-paced distance meter walk 6 minute flat , firm surface . 3 . 10 meter walk test ( 10MWT ) : This self-paced test measure gait speed , important safe community mobility ( e.g. , cross street response signal ) . 4 . Timed Up-and-Go ( TUG ) : This test measure mobility able walk ( assistive device permit ) . 5 . Functional Mobility Scale ( FMS ) : The FMS use three distance ( 5 , 50 500m ) represent typical distance walk child home , school , wide community . 6 . The Activities Scale Kids ( ASK ) child self-report measure physical disability . It design child five 15 year age experience limitation physical activity due musculoskeletal disorder . 7 . The Pediatric Evaluation Disability Inventory™ Computer Adaptive Test ( PEDI-CAT ) measure ability three functional domain Daily Activities , Mobility Social/Cognitive . The PEDI-CAT 's Responsibility domain measure extent caregiver child take responsibility manage complex , multi-step life task . 8 . Self efficiency questionnaire : evaluating perception self efficiency engage physical activity reduce sedentary behavior . Statistics : Focus group : Coding text theorizing : In grounded theory research . Identifying anchor allow key point data gather . Collections cod similar content allow data group . Repeated measure analysis variance ( ANOVA ) use determine effect compare two group method . A correlation test take place ASK Capability PEDI-CAT . A correlation test take place ASK PERFORMANCE result accelerometer . One-way ANOVA test separation sample severity group , accord GMFCS level , use age co-variant .</detailed_description>
