	<brief_summary>This prospective study examine use 99mTc-Annexin V-128 ( AxV-128/Tc ) single-photon emission compute tomography ( SPECT ) /computerized tomography ( CT ) technology image functional assessment lung patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , healthy volunteer smoker without COPD healthy volunteer subject without smoke history . The aim study determine patient COPD increase AxV-128/Tc signal SPECT/CT .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) third lead cause death characterize clinical symptom spirometry . Additional measure diagnosis take use image modality CT . However , evaluation lung destruction COPD limit inability visualize activation pathological process since image modality able evaluate end-organ damage . In proposal , investigator aim assess molecular image probe target apoptosis , cellular process know pathogenic COPD . Apoptosis , process program cellular death , correlate COPD severity see normal adult lung . In past several year investigator demonstrate successful ability AxV-128/Tc detect apoptosis vivo preclinical animal model smoke exposure emphysema model . Additionally , Phase 1 study demonstrate safety agent healthy patient . Therefore , investigator bring AxV-128/Tc forward probe image apoptotic disease process lung patient COPD . The investigator determine image signal correlate serum biomarkers apoptosis inflammation . It investigators ' hypothesis AxV-128/99mTc imaging show increase uptake lung patient COPD , signal intensity correlate accept marker apoptosis inflammation . If successful , approach powerful tool potentially predict disease progression diagnosis , identify patient risk disease exacerbation relate lung function decline , monitor response disease target therapy . The total effective dose combine SPECT CT scan 6.2 millisievert ( mSv ) . This effective dose patient receive standard 2 dose rest stress cardiac nuclear imaging study well within range current clinical nuclear imaging test . The exact long term risk development cancer diagnostic radiological procedure currently debate image procedure study aim keep total radiation burden As Low As Reasonably Achievable ( ALARA ) .</detailed_description>
