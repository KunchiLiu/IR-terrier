	<brief_summary>Lung cancer ( LC ) usually diagnose advanced stage continue lead cause cancer relate death worldwide . Cancer cachexia frequent among patient LC affect 80 % patient advanced stage disease , relate high risk complication , length hospital stay , bad overall survival . During cancer cachexia , muscle fat mass waste , however , loss muscle mass associate higher treatment related toxicity , loss functional status , short progression free survival overall survival different type cancer various treatment . Hence , preservation muscle mass function important focus multidisciplinary treatment patient LC . Pulmonary rehabilitation ( PR ) know improve pulmonary function , reduce fatigue improve exercise tolerance patient LC undergo curative surgery . However , study focus efficacy PR patient advance cancer undergo palliative care chemotherapy target therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The main objective study determine effect pulmonary rehabilitation program pulmonary function muscle mass . Moreover , effect exercise tolerance , inflammatory response , quality live overall survival explore . Patients randomized intervention group ( IG ) control group ( CG ) . Patients IG schedule receive 12 session PR period 4-6 week ( 2-3 session/week ) . CG receive information recommendation physical activity . Both group receive nutritional assessment intervention need .</detailed_description>
