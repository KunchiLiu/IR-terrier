	<brief_title>Adjuvant Chemotherapy In Elderly With Colon Cancer Stage III</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients ≥ 75 year undergone surgery colon cancer stage III , eligible inclusion study . Non-eligibility include patient obvious impaired cognitive physical function patient live nursing home . After sign informed consent , patient first undergo geriatric assessment . Patients classified fit intermediate function , significant cardiovascular disease , randomize 2:1 randomization process either chemotherapy ( Arm A : Capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 bid day 1-14 q3 week , 8 cycle ) chemotherapy ( Arm B : observation ) . The purpose study examine tolerability chemotherapy elderly ( &gt; 75 year ) patient operate colon cancer stage III . There little evidence benefit tolerability therapy elderly ; recommend individual consideration elderly . In study , comprehensive geriatric comprehensive geriatric assessment perform first , exclude frail patient patient serious comorbidities cardiovascular disease . Fit intermediate patient randomize 2/3 receive chemotherapy capecitabine tablets 6 month , 1/3 receive chemotherapy . A new geriatric assessment perform 6 12 month . The main objective study examine whether chemotherapy lead significant loss function , secondary aim include survival , quality life , prognostic effect biomarkers . The study may provide useful information selection patient tolerate benefit adjuvant chemotherapy .</detailed_description>
