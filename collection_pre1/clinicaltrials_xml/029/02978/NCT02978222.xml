	<brief_summary>This blind , randomize , parallel group Phase II trial . Patients platinum sensitive ovarian cancer ( defined time progression &gt; 6 month penultimate platinum contain regimen ) either tumor response stable disease upon complete last platinum contain regimen randomize either vaccine regimen GM-CSF adjuvant GM-CSF adjuvant alone control group . Treatment administer consolidation therapy within 12 week last administration platinum . The vaccination phase include 6 administration study drug 4-week interval . Unless progress go off-study , patient monitor tumor response relapse progression every 12 week enrollment . Once patient off-study , follow quarterly contact study completion survival cancer status . The total duration patient 's participation study 2 year . Assessment tumor response , disease progression recurrence conduct every 12 week end treatment documented disease progression .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Folate Receptor Alpha Peptide Vaccine With GM-CSF Versus GM-CSF Alone Patients With Platinum Sensitive Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter double-blind control randomized Phase II study evaluate activity folate receptor alpha ( FRα ) peptide vaccine consolidation treatment follow completion le 4 cycle platinum contain regimen patient recurrent platinum sensitive , non-mucinous ovarian , fallopian tube primary peritoneal cancer . Patients enrol receive two previous platinum-containing regimen . Patients must determine platinum sensitive completion penultimate platinum therapy prior enrollment study . Platinum sensitivity determine &gt; 6 month &lt; 24 month completion patient 's final platinum dose . In addition patient demonstrate tumor response stable disease upon last platinum-containing regimen ( per RECIST v1.1 and/or CA125 GCIG criterion ) prior enrolment study . Following consent patient eligibility confirm . Patients need start treatment study drug within 12 week last dose chemotherapeutic agent platinum-containing regimen . Following randomization , patient administer TPIV200 GM-CSF adjuvant GM-CSF control alone . Patients tumor assessment do every 12 week ± 1 week 2 year , objective disease progression patient withdraws consent .</detailed_description>
