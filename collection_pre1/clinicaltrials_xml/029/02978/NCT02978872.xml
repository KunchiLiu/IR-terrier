	<brief_title>Quantra Determination Coagulation Parameters Arterial Venous Blood</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Quantra System fully integrate automated vitro diagnostic device utilizes SEER Sonorheometry , ultrasound-based technology , characterize dynamic change viscoelastic property blood sample coagulation clot lysis . Viscoelastic testing perform use exist technology typically perform arterial sample obtain patient undergoing surgical procedure , although reference range test establish venous blood . The aim study evaluate potential difference Quantra measurement determine arterial versus venous blood sample obtain patient undergoing cardiac surgery .</detailed_description>
