	<brief_summary>This observational study involve chart review patient see bariatric clinic since 2012 The Ohio State University ( OSU ) . Obese patient divide two group accord metabolic profile ( healthy v unhealthy ) . The assignment group determine presence diagnosis hypertension , diabetes mellitus and/or dyslipidemia . The presence least 2 diagnosis define metabolically unhealthy . Then , group divide base presence Obstructive Sleep Apnea diagnosis . All data collect review patient 's electronic medical record bariatric clinic database ( investigator collect variable age , gender , race , BMI , smoke status , presence diagnosis Obstructive sleep apnea , hypertension , diabetes , hyperlipidemia ) . The investigator analyze data establish correlation sleep apnea subject ' metabolic profile .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Obesity associate numerous metabolic complication include Type 2 diabetes mellitus , hypertension , dyslipidemia , cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) several form cancer . However , presence obesity-related metabolic abnormality varies among obese individual . The phenotype metabolically healthy obese ( MHO ) individual initially described 1980 include subset obese patient ( defined BMI ) manifest typical metabolic abnormality associate obesity . Although result conflict highly dependent patient population diagnostic criterion metabolic health , individual tend preserve level insulin sensitivity , absence hypertension , favorable lipid , inflammatory , hormonal , hepatic , immunologic profile compare majority metabolically abnormal obese ( MAO ) patient . This seem paradox underscore excess body weight sole determinant obesity-related complication allow novel pathogenic investigation . The postulated mechanism ( ) underlie differential metabolic profile individual well know physiologic molecular basis 'healthy ' obesity remain relatively undiscovered . In addition , recent meta-analysis demonstrate although MHO patient comparable metabolic profile normal weight individual , risk adverse , long-term CV mortality outcomes remain high , call question clinical importance healthy obese categorization . Despite knowledge gap , limited number study recently attempt elucidate process lead MHO profile , include characterization lifestyle factor , adipocyte size , amount location ectopic fat , inflammatory mediator , immune cell , difference gene expression . The prevalence obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) increase increase BMI also link various cardiometabolic abnormality . Patients OSA experience repetitive episode hypoxia reoxygenation transient cessation breathing may provoke adverse systemic effect . These effect reflect increased level biomarkers link endocrine-metabolic cardiovascular disease . OSA may exert negative effect cardiovascular system multiple mechanism include hypoxemia , sleep disruption , activation sympathetic nervous system , inflammatory activation . In spite connection , contribution deleterious effect determine phenotype obese patient ( MHO vs. MAO ) unknown . Furthermore , prevalence OSA two subset well establish . In study , investigator hypothesize prevalence OSA high MAO compare BMI-matched MAO patient Aim 1 : Define prevalence OSA metabolically-healthy obese metabolically abnormal obese ( MHO MAO ) patient . Aim 2 : Elucidate association OSA disease severity parameters marker clinically available abnormal metabolic profile ( elevate cholesterol , blood pressure , fast glucose/hemoglobin A1c , inflammatory marker , insulin resistance available ) .</detailed_description>
