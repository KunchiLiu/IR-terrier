	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Ga-68PSMA PET/MRI Assessment PSMA-positive Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective The primary objective pilot image study determine feasibility use positron emission tomography/ magnetic resonance ( PET/MR ) [ Ga-68 ] prostate-specific membrane antigen ( PSMA ) I &amp; T stag treatment monitoring PSMA express tumor . [ Ga-68 ] PSMA PET/MR finding compare standard care imaging , patient follow , histopathology available . [ Ga-68 ] PSMA PET/MR use change patient ' treatment plan . Investigators assess PET/MR test-retest reproducibility compare baseline [ Ga-68 ] PSMA PET/MR PET/MR initiation ( within 2-6 week ) therapy evaluate [ Ga-68 ] PSMA suitable biomarker treatment monitor assessment early treatment response . Secondary Objectives - To compare early change PET biomarker ( [ Ga-68 ] PSMA ) tumor uptake treatment response assess completion therapy ( prediction treatment response ) . - To compare change MRI signal intensity ( multi-parametric MRI ) treatment response assess completion therapy . - To compare result multi-parametric MR image [ Ga-68 ] PSMA uptake . - To assess combination quantitative PET MRI metric . Study Design Patients , enroll study , undergo baseline [ Ga-68 ] PSMA PET/MR assess level [ Ga-68 ] PSMA tumor uptake . Patients positive [ Ga-68 ] PSMA tumor uptake ( defined [ Ga-68 ] PSMA uptake twice background activity ) receive systemic therapy undergo [ Ga-68 ] PSMA PET/MR 2-6 week start treatment . Patients positive [ Ga-68 ] PSMA tumor uptake also offer participate test- retest study 2nd [ Ga-68 ] PSMA PET/MR prior treatment . Patients therefore undergo maximum three [ Ga-68 ] PSMA PET/MR imaging procedure . The first two test-retest Ga-PSMA-PET/MRI perform separate day allow radioactive decay . There ( e.g . clinically indicate ) PET scan perform day [ Ga-68 ] PSMA-PET/MRI .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients PSMApositive tumor include prostate cancer , breast cancer , lung cancer , tumor type know express PSMA Patients able tolerate PET/MRI scan Informed consent must give signed Subjects meet mention inclusion criterion Subjects refuse give and/or sign inform consent Patients history serious adverse event relate previous MRI PET/CT Patients unable undergo MRI scan due exclusion institutional MRI restriction policy mention standard institutional MRI inform consent form Patients currently pregnant breast feeding . A pregnancy test within 72 hour first PET/MRI perform . Anticancer treatment ( chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy ) within last 2 week . Renal insufficiency : elevate Creatinine and/or Glomerular Filtration Rate ( GFR ) &lt; 40ml/min/1.7sqm ( exclusion criterion contrast enhance MRI ) Patients know allergy component contrast enhance MR agent receive MR contrast agent .
