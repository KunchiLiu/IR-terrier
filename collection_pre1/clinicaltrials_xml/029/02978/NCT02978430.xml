	<brief_summary>The aim study compare implementation computer-assisted goal direct fluid therapy ( GDFT ) standard care fluid therapy major abdominal surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Implementation Computer-Assisted Intraoperative Goal-Directed Fluid Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fluid therapy one main tool use anesthesiology maintain adequate hemodynamic stability . Goal-directed fluid therapy ( GDFT ) base cardiac output and/or dynamic parameter fluid responsiveness ( e.g . pulse pressure variation ) show decrease post-operative complication . The main inconvenience protocol base therapy technical complexity require considerable time , attention , vigilance . GDFT assist closed-loop system , compare manual GDFT , associate longer preload independent state could increase clinician adherence protocol . To day study compare closed-loop assist GDFT standard care . Goal : This study compare result study entitle `` Crystalloids Colloids Goal direct Fluid Therapy With Closed-loop Assistance Major Surgery '' ( NCT02312999 ) standard care group ( start retrospectively first include patient study ) fluid therapy base static variable ( e.g . arterial pressure , heart rate , central venous pressure ( CVP ) , urine output . ) These group consist population undergo type surgery . Hypothesis : A protocolized approach use computer-assisted GDFT compare standard care associate less fluid administration less blood transfusion .</detailed_description>
