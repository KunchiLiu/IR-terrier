	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : - To assess efficacy MGCD516 patient advance liposarcoma evaluate progression free rate 12 week compare historical control . Secondary Objectives : - To evaluate safety profile MGCD516 assess adverse event rate ( accord National Cancer Institute CTCAE version 4.0 criterion ) patient treat agent . - To assess efficacy MGCD516 patient advance liposarcoma evaluate overall response rate ( accord RECIST 1.1 criterion ) , progression free survival overall survival patient treat agent .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MGCD516 Advanced Liposarcoma Other Soft Tissue Sarcomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sarcomas comprise heterogeneous group uncommon solid tumor mesenchymal origin , 50 subtypes define . In 2015 , approximately 11,930 people diagnosed sarcoma , 4,870 die malignancy . The primary management localize sarcomas surgical resection feasible . Unfortunately , therapeutic option patient metastatic unresectable disease remain limited . The various subtypes sarcoma differ greatly clinical molecular characteristic well response traditional cytotoxic agent radiotherapy . Outcomes generally poor advanced disease , doxorubicin combination gemcitabine docetaxel elicit objective response 25 % patient , median overall survival diagnosis metastatic disease limit 12 18 month . For majority patient advance sarcoma , outcomes remain disappointing , new approach urgently need .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Stage 1 , histologically confirm welldifferentiated dedifferentiated liposarcoma . If stage 1 Simon II stage design fail meet endpoint liposarcoma patient , additional 16 patient enrol , compose 4 MPNST , synovial sarcoma , alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma alveolar soft part sarcoma ( otherwise , additional 16 patient welldifferentiated dedifferentiated liposarcoma would enrol ) . Pathology review occur center enrol patient trial . Disease must locally advance unresectable metastatic . Disease may resect associated level morbidity deem unacceptable treat clinician consider eligible . Patients must measurable disease RECIST criterion version 1.1 . Patients must evidence disease progression , either clinically radiographically , within 8 week prior study enrollment , determine principal investigator . Patients must treat least one prior systemic regimen sarcoma . Adjuvant systemic therapy qualifies prior therapy purpose study . There upper limit previous line therapy receive . A prior line systemic therapy may include prior investigational agent receive part clinical study . Patients must age 18 year old . Because dose adverse event data currently available MGCD516 patient less 18 year age , child exclude present study , eligible future pediatric trial . Patients must demonstrate ECOG performance status 0 1 . Patients must demonstrate normal organ marrow function define : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1,500/mm3 Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3 Creatinine ≤ 1.5 time upper limit normal OR Calculated creatinine clearance &gt; 45 mL/min Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 time upper limit normal AST/ALT ≤ 1.5 time upper limit normal Patients must demonstrate adequately control blood pressure time study entry , define blood pressure ≤ 150/100 mmHg study screen least one two screening conduct least 24 hour apart . If blood pressure meet guideline initial measurement , subsequent measurement screening need . Blood pressure may assess automate manual method appropriately trained clinician nurse . Patients must normal leave ventricular systolic function , demonstrate transthoracic echocardiogram MUGA scan show normal left ventricular ejection fraction . The effect MGCD516 develop human fetus unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control , abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Men treat enrol protocol must also agree use adequate contraception prior study , duration study participation , 4 month completion MGCD516 administration . If patient agree , consider eligible . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Patients must receive treatment chemotherapy , immunotherapy , radiotherapy investigational agent malignancy within 28 day precede study registration . Patients may receive treatment nitrosureas mitomycin within 42 day prior study registration . Patients may receive treatment small molecule target agent ( include offlabel investigational use ) within 14 day precede study registration , provide represent least 7 halflives agent . Toxic effect prior therapy ( except alopecia ) must resolve grade 1 less accord NCI CTCAE v4.0 patient 's baseline time registration . Patients may receive investigational agent purpose concurrently . Patients may require ongoing treatment ( ) gastric pH modify medication include proton pump inhibitor H2 blocker ( patient may switch antacid ) , ( b ) medication know sensitive substrate substrate narrow therapeutic index Pgp BCRP transporter and/or ( c ) medication know cause QTc prolongation risk Torasades . Please see Appendix 1 list prohibit concomitant medication study entry . Patients brain metastasis symptomatic may enrol . Those subject untreated brain metastasis ≤ 1 cm may asymptomatic plan surgery , radiation corticosteroid use may consider eligible discretion principal investigator . Subjects brain metastasis treat stable least 1 month eligible asymptomatic receiving corticosteroid . Patients may history allergic reaction hypersensitivity microcrystalline cellulose ( Avicel PH302 ) polysorbate 80 ( Tween 80 ) , component drug product MGCD516 . Patients may uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia , uncontrolled diabetes mellitus uncontrolled psychiatric illness would limit compliance study requirement opinion principal investigator . Additionally , patient must free impairment ability swallow absorb oral study drug . Patients may pregnant nursing . Pregnant woman exclude study teratogenic effect MGCD516 adequately study . A negative pregnancy test must document 7 day less prior registration . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother MGCD516 , breastfeed must discontinue prior registration clinical trial . Patients may know HIV infection . HIVpositive patient combination .</criteria>
