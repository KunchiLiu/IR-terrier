	<brief_summary>The aim study determine 99mTc Annexin V-128 ( AxV- 128/Tc ) single photon emission compute tomography ( SPECT ) -computed tomography ( CT ) detect perioperative lung injury . The investigator study patient undergo major surgery , specifically Whipple procedure ( pancreatico-duodenectomies ) compare AxV-128/Tc SPECT-CT scan surgery Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) non-COPD patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Lung injury commonly detect unless structural damage occur . SPECT-CT scan use specific tracer light detect apoptosis ( program cell death ) use detect even minor lung injury example smoke inhalation animal may sensitive detect less severe injury . The present study aim study SPECT-CT scan use tracer apoptosis , 99mTc Annexin V-128 ( AxV- 128/Tc ) , detect lung injury major surgery . Prolonged ventilation surgery cause minor lung injury usually clinically detect . The investigator plan study 40 patient ( 20 patient pre-existing lung disease-COPD 20 patient normal preoperative lung function ) undergoing Whipple operation major surgery . The investigator obtain SPECT-CT scan 2-3 day surgery compare uptake radioactive tracer plasma marker lung injury ( Soluble Receptors Advanced Glycation End Products ( sRAGE ) , Interleukin 6 ( IL-6 ) , Clara-cell 16 lung surfactant protein D ( SP-D ) among others ) . The investigator ask subject undergo spirometry testing , blood draw urine collection . In addition , SPECT-CT scan last approximately 1 hour perform prior surgery 2-3 day post-operatively ( still hospitalize ) . The total effective dose combine SPECT CT scan 6.2 millisievert ( mSv ) . This effective dose patient receive standard 2 dose rest stress cardiac nuclear imaging study well within range current clinical nuclear imaging test . The exact long term risk development cancer diagnostic radiological procedure currently debate image procedure study aim keep total radiation burden As Low As Reasonably Achievable ( ALARA ) .</detailed_description>
