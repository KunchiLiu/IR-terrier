	<brief_title>Proton Dose Escalation Patients With Atypical Anaplastic Meningiomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial intend optimize treatment grade II grade III ( atypical anaplastic ) meningioma . Standard treatment atypical anaplastic meningioma surgery . For grade III ( anaplastic ) meningioma , post-operative radiotherapy would perform case use standard fractionation schedule total dose ~60 Gy . For grade II ( atypical ) meningioma , although small patient datasets support early onset radiotherapy , standard treatment still irradiate tumour recurrent resection macroscopically incomplete . Total dose 54 ~60 Gy apply use standard fractionation schedule . A major problem treatment atypical anaplastic meningioma beyond surgery radiotherapy , experimental treatment option probability local recurrence 50-100 % within first 5 year grade II grade III meningioma . The present trial develop evaluate efficacy dose-intensified radiotherapy treatment schedule incompletely resect meningioma total dose 68 ( grade II ) 72 Gy ( grade III ) . To minimize normal tissue toxicity , boost dose complete radiotherapy apply use proton . The expectation high recurrence-free survival compare previous report outcome standard dose ( 60 Gy ) radiotherapy .</detailed_description>
