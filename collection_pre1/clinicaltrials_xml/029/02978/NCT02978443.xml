	<brief_title>A Biomarker Study Advanced Mucosal Acral Lentiginous Melanoma Receiving Nivolumab Combination With Ipilimumab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Immunotherapy HD-IL-2 produce durable benefit 10 % patient metastatic cutaneous melanoma . The antitumor activity IL-2 limit least part immunosuppressive immune-regulatory force within tumor microenvironment . Antibodies CTLA4 ( e.g . ipilimumab ) , PD1 ligand ( PD-L1 ) produce long-term benefit approximately 20-40 % patient advanced melanoma . In addition , combination ipilimumab anti-PD1 antibody , nivolumab , show tumor responses 60 % patient advanced melanoma . These finding lead FDA approval ipilimumab nivolumab indication treatment patient advance melanoma nivolumab cancer . While data excite , patient enrol prior study metastatic MCM ALM . There prospective immunotherapy study conduct MCM ALM-specific population . Therefore activity ipilimumab + nivolumab combination subset patient remain unknown Reliable predictive biomarkers use immune checkpoint inhibitor need identify pretreatment patient likely respond early treatment assay could help identify mechanisms tumor response resistance necessary improve therapy . Although tumor PD-L1 expression tumor confers higher treatment response rate , responses nivolumab nivolumab + ipilimumab alone note 55 % 41 % patient , respectively , PD-L1- tumor . Therefore , reliable predictive biomarkers need . Recently , extensive study metastatic colorectal cancer demonstrate new scoring system well density immune cell infiltrate center tumor invasive margin , describe Immunoscore , could accurately separate group patient high Immunoscore improve DFS , OS low Immunoscore histopathological stag system . A recent study also demonstrate relationship degree pre-treatment CD8+ tumor infiltrate lymphocyte ( TILs ) infiltration PD-L1 expression invasive margin advance cutaneous melanoma improve long-term clinical benefit patient advance melanoma receive pembrolizumab monotherapy . Further , appear association tumor response clonality immune infiltrate base next-generation sequence method use evaluate T-cell receptor rearrangement pre- response checkpoint inhibitor therapy . Also , high mutational burden correlate overall survival patient cutaneous melanoma treat ipilimumab lung cancer treat anti-PD1 . However , biology MCM ALM distinct cutaneous melanoma multiple level . Consequently , utility predictive biomarkers develop cutaneous melanoma remain unknown .</detailed_description>
