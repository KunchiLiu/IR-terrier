	<detailed_description>Methods reliably predict cutaneous wound heal unreliable clinical judgment inadequate . This problem health care provider common dilemma evaluate patient Emergency Department . While capillary blood perfusion skin recognize requirement healing , objective method reliably quantify necessary physiological parameter lack . In large part , due difficulty visualize record capillary blood flow . Despite technical advance blood flow image capillary circulation remain poorly characterize . That , current methodology image medium-to-large caliber vessel , small capillary . The investigator hypothesize new technology , objective assessment capillary flow achieve fluorescence-mediated photoplethysmography ( FM-PPG ) methodology , evaluation use objectively determine wound heal promptly versus require adjunctive intervention . FM-PPG currently use clinically clinic worldwide way image blood flow , apparatus provide relative measurement . Thus , investigation Observational nature Interventional . With repeated evaluation week , current FM-PPG allows assessment make whether wound condition improve . The investigator device contain new image software , theory , offer precise quantification capillary blood flow . If true , single measurement may provide data necessary predict patient danger heal thus require aggressive , time expensive painful intervention - even bad - limb amputation . This protocol test proof-of-concept first evaluate cutaneous capillary follow 30 normal , healthy individual 30 individual present treatment variety skin wound clinic . FM-PPG methodology require intravenous injection small amount fluorescent dye , indocyanine green ( ICG ) . ICG FDA-approved agent safely used 4000 patient . The area skin measure position camera low-power laser instrument take fluorescent picture . The ICG dissolve sterile salt water injection one one half tablespoon inject vein . Typically , measure sequence consist obtain fluorescence image rate approximately 30/second period 15 second . Following acquisition initial transit angiogram sequence , several additional 15-second-long image sequence acquire next half-hour , without additional injection . At 60 second follow dye injection , two teaspoon venous blood withdrawn . This blood use laboratory determine ICG dye concentration verification concentration determine camera image part FM-PPG software algorithm ( circulate dye concentration need calculation quantitative blood perfusion ) . Since study first employ methodology capable acquire absolute tissue blood perfusion data multiple subject , exist database indicate normal range variation skin tissue perfusion occur normal subject . Since abnormal perfusion clearly recognize normal range variation establish , first 30 subject normal individual . Then follow 30 subject patient undergo wound heal therapy .</detailed_description>
