	<brief_summary>Stereotactic radiosurgery ( SRS ) increasingly administer sole treatment brain metastasis , order spare acute long term side effect associate whole brain radiotherapy . Local control SRS treat lesion good , patient tend develop additional brain metastasis subsequently . Nivolumab modulator immune system . Treatment Nivolumab associate increase local control survival patient non-small cell lung cancer clear cell renal cell carcinoma . In presence Nivolumab , treatment brain metastasis SRS may trigger immune reaction cancer . Therefore , combination SRS Nivolumab may reduce development new brain metastasis improve patient survival . The purpose study assess effect combine Nivolumab SRS control cancer progression . SRS administer patient receive Nivolumab .</brief_summary>
