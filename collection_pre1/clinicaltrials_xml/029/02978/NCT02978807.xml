	<brief_summary>The objective study determine appropriate effective approach diagnosis gestational diabetes mellitus ( GDM ) among pregnant woman receive focus antenatal care Moi Teaching Referral Hospital ( MTRH ) . This do performing random blood sugar , fast blood sugar , 1 hr/2hr glucose tolerance test , HbA1c participants meet eligibility criterion provide write , informed consent . The specific research question : appropriate screening diagnostic strategy patient receive antenatal care MTRH ?</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1.0 Background Worldwide , 70 million woman reproductive age diabetes impaired glucose tolerance place risk complication hyperglycemia pregnancy . The global prevalence rate gestational diabetes mellitus ( GDM ) vary 12 % 14 % depend population study . ( 1,2 ) The estimate prevalence GDM report Western ( 11.6 % ) South Africa ( 3.8 % - 8.8 % ) lack publish result consistency diagnosis , treatment , outcomes Eastern Africa , extent problem GDM unknown Kenya . ( 2 ) Estimates study sub-Saharan Africa ( SSA ) reveal widely variable prevalence range 2.4 % 14 % different methodology population different risk category . This lack focus investigation GDM Kenya concern preliminary , unpublished data Kenyan Global Network Study birth outcome suggest 5.5 % birth weight Western Kenya great 4000g , suggest substantial potential burden diabetes mellitus ( DM ) GDM population . ( 3 ) Maternal hyperglycemia pregancy predispose offspring glucose intolerance future fetal programming . ( 1,4,5 ) This vicious cycle influence perpetuate incidence prevalence diabetes population . Infants born mother diabetes experience double risk serious injury birth , triple likelihood caeserean delivery quadruple incidence newborn intensive care unit admission . ( 6-8 ) These maternal , fetal , neonatal morbidity attributable diabetes pregnancy prevent early diagnosis DM effective treatment . Within landscape care Western Kenya , pregnancy may time woman present medical care . Therefore , pregnancy opportune time receptive audience screen possible pregestational diabetes , promote health education , diagnose glucose intolerance woman transition beyond postnatal period . MTRH second large referral hospital Kenya serve referral center whole Western Kenya . Although access healthcare limited rural area Kenya , Antenatal Clinic hospital serve 12,000 new mother annually . Screening GDM antenatal clinic MTRH currently limit routine urinalysis glucosuria . Sutherland colleague find 11 % unselected obstetric population 1418 woman random glucosuria . However , 1 % glucosuria abnormal glucose tolerance test.9 Glucosuria common pregnancy show correlate diagnosis GDM . 2.0 Rationale Specific Aims The use routine urinalysis screen strategy GDM consistent national international guideline . ( 10-13 ) There currently consensus best method screen GDM rural setting lack infrastructure venous test . There variety test strategy predominantly test resource-rich setting use standard care worldwide . Unfortunately , test strategy validate implemented resource-constrained setting like exist Western Kenya . ( 2 ) In United Kingdom , general lack consensus ; center employ 75g glucose tolerance test ( Sensitivity 29 % Specificity 96 % - value 75g 2hr postprandial random blood sugar glucose tolerance test ) , others adopt two-stage protocol , start 50g screen , follow , abnormal , 75-g glucose tolerance test . Also , accord WHO criteria ADA guideline GDM diagnosis , random blood sugar &gt; 11mmol/L ( 198 mg/dL ) fast blood sugar &gt; 7.0mmol/L ( 126 mg/dL ) meet threshold diagnosis GDM . ( 12 ) Because uncertainty , International Association Diabetes Pregnancy Study Groups ( IADPSG ) recently help provide great clarity issue issue suggest guideline diagnose gestational diabetes overt diabetes pregnancy . They recommend 75gm oral glucose tolerance test cutpoints derive Hyperglycemia Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes ( HAPO ) study patient receive GDM screen . As suggested IADPSG guideline emerge body literature , grow support utilization glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) diagnose diabetes . ( 16 ) Lipska colleague report woman people African-American ethnicity likely identify dysglycemia use HgbA1c fast blood glucose . A notable weakness study perform adult age 70-79 thus unlcear whether HbAIC use diagnostic tool pregnancy . None currently available study evaluate use A1c 's GDM include African woman . ( 17-20 ) Several study also raise concern accuracy HbA1c African population HbA1c result tend high see population . ( 21-23 ) Because various approach currently propose IADPSG guideline , still considerable debate appropriate test employ recommend perform fast blood sugar , HbA1c , random plasma glucose woman first prenatal visit . If diagnosis diabetes make assessment , recommend 75g oral glucose tolerance test perform 24th 28th week pregnancy test GDM . By combine result several study also analyze additive benefit combine different strategy . Through investigation conclude analyze fast blood sugar alone enable identify 8.3 % evaluable population , 1 hour glucose measurement identify another 5.7 % , 2 hour glucose measurement identify additional 2.1 % . One major limitation investigation , however , cohort include patient reflective rural SSA population investigator trial serve Western Kenya . This theme illustrate throughout background deficiency publish result regard GDM SSA population . ( 10 ) The IADPSG diagnosis approach also assume vast majority expectant mother frequent contact healthcare system include early prenatal visit subsequent visit throughout pregnancy . This trend commonly see SSA large proportion expectant mother deliver home minimal contact healthcare system . ( 2 ) Because dynamic , clear need simplify diagnostic approach GDM also assess relative utility test strategy ( ie . random blood sugar , fast blood sugar , 1 hr/2hr glucose tolerance test , HbA1c ) . Through proposal , investigator hope take first step towards address GDM set assess relative effectiveness point care test strategy , comparison gold standard approach use 75gm oral glucose tolerance test representative understudied population .</detailed_description>
