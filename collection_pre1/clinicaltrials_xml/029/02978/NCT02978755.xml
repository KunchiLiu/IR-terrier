	<brief_summary>First human study , assess safety profile , pharmacokinetics preliminary antitumor activity GM102 , new compound ( monoclonal antibody ) , administer alone patient previously treat gynecological cancer bear AMHRII ( anti-mullerian Hormone Receptor II ) receptor . The primary objective study determine GM102 recommend dose .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>AMHRII reexpressed subset gynecological cancer . GM102 humanize low fucose monoclonal antibody high affinity AMHRII receptor . GM102 act enhanced capability engage immune effector cell ( macrophage , natural killer ( NK ) cell ) trigger ADCC ( antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity ) phagocytosis tumor cell . Patients gynecological tumor express AMHRII receptor tumor cell archive tissue determine prior study entry eligible C101 study . C101 consist phase I part ( dose escalation ) phase Ib part ( expansion ) . The phase I part design determine recommend phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) use classical 3+3 dose-finding design . In six successive escalate dose cohort , patient receive GM102 infusion every 2 week maximum 6 cycle . A Trial Steering Committee ( TSC ) analyze qualify toxicity provide recommendation accord dose administration rule define protocol . At end phase I part , RP2D determine TSC , take account dose limit toxicity ( DLTs ) , overall toxicity , pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics effect GM102 . The Phase Ib part study confirm tolerance select dose ( RP2D ) assess antitumoral activity GM102 two cohort patient Sex Cord-Stromal tumor AMHRII positive gynecological tumor . Patients treat maximum 12 cycle .</detailed_description>
