	<brief_summary>A two-arm randomise control trial patient receive post-prostatectomy radiotherapy adjuvant salvage setting , patient randomise receive daily ProSpare ( obturator ) guide IMRT Centre standard ( non-obturator ) guide IMRT .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial Assessing Post-Operative Use ProSpare , Rectal Obturator Prostate Cancer Radiotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Surgery remove prostate gland one way treat prostate cancer . Some patient receive radiotherapy surgery cancer may completely remove . Radiotherapy area prostate cause side effect , cause bowel bladder symptom well reduce sexual function . Radiotherapy alone also standard treatment prostate cancer . At Royal Marsden Hospital Institute Cancer Research investigator design patented device call ProSpare improve accuracy radiotherapy . The device already develop tested 80 patient prostate radiotherapy well tolerate . Treatment accuracy improve radiation dose rectum reduce . Patients give valuable feedback comment ProSpare 's design use , investigator incorporate final design . It important test ProSpare multi-centre randomise control trial . The investigator aim determine whether ProSpare reduce side effect report patient radiotherapy prostatectomy . The ProSpare device insert patient rectum daily radiotherapy treatment . The disposable device stay place 15 minute day . The curve device design follow shape rectum stay correct place securely locate anal sphincter . ProSpare contain small `` marker '' - steel ball bear - `` see '' standard scan take radiotherapy treatment . Treatment adjust daily treatment account patient movement radiotherapy set-up variation . As result , treatment accurate use standard method radiotherapy localisation . This mean radiotherapy `` safety margin '' place around prostate bed reduce . The dose rectum bladder well structure associate erectile function reduce . This may lead improvement side effect cause radiotherapy . Other way identify treatment target area image guide radiotherapy ( IGRT ) include insertion fiducial marker - usually form gold seed prostate prostate bed . This become standard practice radiotherapy centre prostate radiotherapy technically complex prostate bed radiotherapy routinely use . ProSpare additional advantage non-invasive without risk infection associate fiducial insertion . Patients randomly select either standard treatment use ProSpare daily adjust set-up margin . During treatment , patient ask question give questionnaire complete , ask bowel , urinary sexual function . The investigator look result group see treatment ProSpare benefit improve side effect radiotherapy . If benefit see , aim ProSpare guide radiotherapy become part standard treatment prostate bed radiotherapy nationally internationally .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion : 1 . Patient undergone radical prostatectomy 2 . Histologically confirm prostatic cancer 3 . Patient due receive postoperative prostate bed radiotherapy either adjuvant salvage* set 4. WHO performance status 01 randomization 5 . Normal anal tone assess rectal examination 6 . Age &gt; 18 year 7 . Written inform consent 8 . Able independently complete patient questionnaires 1 . Lymph node distant metastasis prostate cancer 2 . Pelvic lymph node radiotherapy plan 3 . Prior pelvic radiotherapy 4 . Previous invasive cancer past 3 year , exception nonmelanoma skin cancer 5 . Symptomatic haemorrhoid anal condition affect adequate insertion retention rectal obturator 6 . Planned chemotherapy within 2 month completion adjuvant salvage radiotherapy 7 . Musculoskeletal condition limit flexibility mobility make patient self insertion ProSpareâ„¢ difficult 8 . Comorbid condition likely impact advisability prostate bed radiotherapy ( e.g . inflammatory bowel disease , previous colorectal surgery , significant bladder instability urinary incontinence )</criteria>
