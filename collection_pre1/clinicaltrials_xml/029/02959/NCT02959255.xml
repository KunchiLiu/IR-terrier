	<brief_summary>Helicobacter pylorus ( H. pylorus ) infection highly associate gastrointestinal disorder , include peptic ulcer disease , gastric cancer , gastric mucosa associate lymphoid tissue lymphoma.1 In 1994 , H. pylorus classify group carcinogen International Agency Research Cancer . Since , many consensus conference clinical guideline worldwide establish treatment H. pylorus infection . Despite H. pylorus infect estimate 50 % global population , universally effective regimen everyday clinical practice . The current European Helicobacter Study Group Guidelines first line empirical treatment H. pylori infection propose variety treatment strategy , optimal treatment H. pylorus infection require careful attention local antibiotic resistance eradication pattern . Most recently , Toronto Consensus Treatment Helicobacter pylorus Infection Adults strongly recommend H. pylori eradication regimen give 14 day . Recommended first-line strategy include concomitant nonbismuth quadruple therapy ( proton pump inhibitor [ PPI ] + amoxicillin + metronidazole + clarithromycin [ PAMC ] ) traditional bismuth quadruple therapy ( PPI + bismuth + metronidazole + tetracycline [ PBMT ] ) .The aforementioned statement international work group specialist choose Canadian Association Gastroenterology outmost importance , especially country increase antibiotic resistance , like Greece , resistance rate &gt; 20 % clarithromycin &gt; 40 % metronidazole .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>10-day Versus 14-day Concomitant PAMC First-line Treatment Strategy Eradication H. Pylori Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Greece , efficacy 10-day concomitant PAMC scheme recently establish , knowledge head-to-head comparison evaluate treatment time ( 10 versus 14 day ) therapeutic regimen try . We decide conduct randomize double blind control clinical study compare 10-day versus 14-day concomitant PAMC therapeutic scheme first-line treatment strategy eradication H. pylorus infection , country increase dual resistance clarithromycin metronidazole ( bismuth unavailable ) . The primary end point study treatment efficacy ( primary secondary antibiotic resistance ) , secondary end point patient compliance safety . This open label prospective randomize trial hold Army Share Fund Hospital ( NIMTS ) , Athens , Greece , conduct Hospital 's Department Gastroenterology . Written inform consent obtain participant enrollment . The study must approve hand Institutional Review Board Hospital . Interventions A physician recruit obtain patient ' demographic data medical history . Using sealed envelope , eligible patient randomize two group , research assistant assign therapy accord treatment allocation keep envelope . In first group , patient assign 10-day concomitant PAMC therapy ( 40mg esomeprazole twice daily , 500mg clarithromycin twice daily , 1gr amoxicillin twice daily , 500mg metronidazole twice daily ) . In second group , patient assign concomitant PAMC therapy 14days . Each envelope contain precise write instruction regard treatment schedule , dose , time medication ingestion , instruction available , need , via telephone . Follow-up outcome To confirm compliance , patient ask bring remain medication 5 day end treatment count rest pill . Patients compliance &lt; 80 % exclude study per protocol ( PP ) analysis . Patients also interview reason responsible miss dos regimen , well occurrence new worsen medical condition lead seek medical attention . Adverse event classify minor major , later lead discontinuation treatment . Four week treatment period ( administration PPIs antibiotic ) , confirm H. pylorus eradication use C13-UBT staff member blind eradication arm patient . In case treatment failure , repeat endoscopy perform biopsy specimens take ( two antrum two body stomach ) . Biopsy specimens culture antibiotic susceptibility determine amoxicillin , tetracycline , clarithromycin , metronidazole , levofloxacin aid agar dilution test , accord standard European protocol.14,15 The microbiologist perform agar dilution test blind treatment . If first-line eradication therapy fail , second-line therapy administer , accord antibiotic susceptibility . Statistical analysis In study , clinically significant difference eradication two group 15 % . In order achieve 80 % power detect difference , along alpha level 0.05 allocation ratio 1:1 , calculate need sample 364 patient . Since convenient clinical sample , study terminate either reach number patient study 's timeline limitation . Baseline characteristic compare difference observe eradication rate study group assess . The result study analyzed intention treat ( ITT ) PP population . The ITT analysis include randomize patient take least one dose study medication ( regardless compliance ) . The patient whose infection statuses unknown follow treatment consider treatment failure purpose ITT analysis . The PP analysis include patient least 80 % compliance ( exclude patient unknown H. pylorus status follow therapy major protocol violation ) .</detailed_description>
