	<detailed_description>During study visit clinician applies transcranial light therapy side participant 's forehead 30 minute . The study involve , 1 screen visit may last 3 hour , 24 transcranial light therapy treatment visit , 1 post-treatment visit ( 26 total visit Massachusetts General Hospital ) . If participant qualifies study , assign participant chance receive either active transcranial light therapy sham transcranial light therapy treatment . During sham transcranial light therapy visit , transcranial light therapy device produce near infrared wave ( e.g. , light energy penetrate skin cranium ) . Participants equal chance assign active transcranial light therapy sham transcranial light therapy first randomize . Neither participant , clinician , research staff know study group participant belongs . Participants randomize second time 6-weeks study . If participant sham group first 6-weeks , participant may receive active transcranial light therapy treatment re-randomization . If participant already active transcranial light therapy group first 6-weeks participant continue receive active treatment . All , participant 1 3 chance receive active transcranial light therapy treatment point study .</detailed_description>
