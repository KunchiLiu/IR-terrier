	<detailed_description>Methods : An authorization translate survey Spanish obtain survey author . The translation cross-cultural adaptation carry base guideline international criterion propose Sperber . The NEQOL translate independently English Spanish two professional translator . Each one provide write report , combine author new version contain reliable translation question . The new version back translated English two different professional translator , blind original version NEQOL . A new English version develop combine write report . The aim back translation compare item new English version original NEQOL . Each item new English version compare original questionnaire 30 native English speaker . The success translation evaluate use two scale comparison : comparability language similarity interpretability . Each one use Likert scale range 1 ( extremely comparable/ extremely similar ) 7 ( comparable/ similar ) . A mean score question obtain . Questions mean score three less include Spanish version . The Spanish version NEQOL test 10 subject diagnose GERD , subject provide feedback survey content , use make final correction . The questionnaire contain fourteen question ; every statement refers impact esophageal condition quality life . There five option rank true true , every option mean numerical value , high grade questionnaire express well quality life low impact health-related quality life . Patients 18 year old chronic esophageal disorder , require functional esophageal test ph-impedanciometry and/or high-resolution manometry , include . Written inform consent obtain . All participant complete questionnaire perform functional esophageal test gastroenterologist specialized functional esophageal pathology perform esophageal test analyze result . Finally , data questionnaire compare esophageal test result order stablish correlation impact quality life measure questionnaire test result . Statistical analysis : Base line characteristic analyze use Chi-square Fisher Test categorical variable , Mann-Whitney Test continue variable . Continuous variable express mean +/- standard deviation . The sensitivity , specificity , predictive value accuracy calculate 95 % Confidence Interval ( 95 % CI ) . A P value le 0.05 consider statistically significant . All statistical analysis perform use SPSS software suite v.22 .</detailed_description>
