	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Pulmonary hypertension severe disorder define elevated mean pulmonary arterial pressure ( mPAP ) &gt; 25 mmHg rest . A classification different type pulmonary hypertension establish accord share pathologic clinical feature well similar therapeutic option recently update . Five major category define include 1 ) pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) , 2 ) PH owe leave heart disease , 3 ) PH owe lung disease and/or hypoxia , 4 ) chronic thromboembolic PH ( CTEPH ) 5 ) PH unclear multifactorial mechanism . PAH commonly define elevate PAP ( &gt; 25 mmHg rest ) normal pulmonary arterial wedge pressure ( &lt; 15 mmHg ) , characterize pre-capillary arteriopathy presence vascular remodel formation plexiform lesion , increase pulmonary vascular resistance ( PVR ) , may result right heart failure . PAH may idiopathic ( IPAH ) , heritable ( HPAH ) associate drug/toxin exposure medical condition include connective tissue disease , congenital heart disease , human immunodeficiency virus portal hypertension . Familial case already report early fifty , 2000 , bone morphogenic protein receptor type 2 gene ( BMPR2 ) identify gene responsible 70 % HPAH 20 % IPAH . BMPR2 belong superfamily growth factor receptor , include bone morphogenic protein ( BMPs ) transform growth factor beta ( TGF-Î² ) consequently control cellular function proliferation , migration , differentiation apoptosis . BMPR2 mutation may favor activation p38MAPK-dependent pro-proliferative pathway , also ; key player cytokine-induced inflammatory signal pathway . Although BMPR2 mutation carrier develop PAH 10 year earlier non-carriers display severe hemodynamic change , 20 % BMPR2 mutation carrier develop PAH . A role inflammation pathogenesis PAH suggest . A predictive role various cytokine recently evidence PAH . The investigator observe elevated C-reactive protein ( CRP ) circulating level PAH evidence predictive role CRP PAH . Interestingly , heterozygous null BMPR2 mouse fail develop PAH unless additional inflammatory insult apply . More recently , inhibition leukocyte recruitment show impair PAH progression mouse genetic ablation endothelial BMPR-II . This consequently suggest inflammation could play role second hit BMPR2 mutation carrier develop PAH . Besides , lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 ( Lp-PLA2 ) also name plasma platelet-activating factor-acetylhydrolase ( PAF-AH ) , product PLA2G7 gene enzyme capable inactivate platelet-activating factor ( PAF ) , potent lipid mediator inflammation potent vasoconstrictor , analog . Several study evidence increase PAF-AH mass activity hypercholesterolemia coronary heart disease . In recent meta-analysis include 70,000 patient 32 epidemiologic study , high circulate PAF-AH level identify independent predictive risk factor cardiovascular event . When over-expressed rodent , Lp-PLA2 display anti-inflammatory property reduce atherogenesis , suggest potential anti-inflammatory role Lp-PLA2 . Lp-PLA2 polymorphisms identify Lp-PLA2 activity strongly associate genetic variant relate LDL- cholesterol level . In preliminary study , investigator observe diminished Lp-PLA2 activity plasma PAH patient , together low total LDL-cholesterol level . HYPOTHESIS &amp; OBJECTIVES Regarding previous current result investigator , hypothesize combine analysis different inflammatory biomarkers BMPR2 mutation , currently analyze patient diagnose idiopathic familial PAH , could contribute establish early diagnosis consequently well orientate therapeutic strategy . Moreover , BMPR2 gene mutation responsible 70 % HPAH 20 % IPAH ; among human BMPR2 mutation carrier , 20 % develop PAH , suggest BMPR2 mutation unique cause develop PAH second hit , inflammation , would require play trigger role development PAH . METHODOLOGY 1 . Identification biomarkers For current study , one aim identify one several biomarkers could predict adverse outcome PAH . To address aim , investigator would like evaluate level CRP , total cholesterol , HDL-cholesterol , triglyceride , albumin , Lp-PLA2 activity , Thrombin Activatable Fibrinolysis Inhibitor ( TAFI ) vitamin D blood plasma patient diagnose PAH UZ Leuven ( Campus Gasthuisberg ) . To perform analysis , investigator would need 5 tubes blood : - one EDTA send Hospital Laboratory ( CRP , lipid profile albumin ) ; - one citrate measure TAFI ( Laboratory Pharmaceutical Biology , KU Leuven ) ; - one EDTA prepare plasma store laboratory Pneumology ( KU Leuven ) , aliquot send INSERM UMRS937 ( Paris , France ) , measure Lp-PLA2 activity ; - one EDTA send CME genomic DNA isolation study BMPR2 , ALK-1 ENG mutation ; genomic DNA store potential future genetic ; - one Silica Clot Activator send Hospital Laboratory ( vitamin D ) . 2 . Human pulmonary arterial cell isolation Another aim investigate whether relationship impair BMPR2 signal inflammation could result dysfunction pulmonary arterial cell PAH . To achieve objective , investigator propose investigate : i. vitro effect inflammatory mediator macrophages activation human pre-capillary pulmonary arterial endothelial cell ( PAEC ) proliferate migrate property PASMC BMPR2 carrier non-carriers PAH patient ; ii . expression distribution inflammatory mediator , receptor BMPR2 human lung parenchyma distal pulmonary artery ; iii . ex-vivo vasoreactive effect inflammatory mediator mention isolated human pre-capillary pulmonary artery . iv . Moreover , pulmonary arterial endothelial cell harvest patient undergo right heart catheterization use recently describe technique , consist isolate endothelial cell balloon Swan-Ganz catheter commonly use perform right heart catheterization patient . 3 . Pulmonary tissue collection Lung parenchyma collect ) PAH patient time lung transplantation , ii ) eventually unused donor lung iii ) tissue surround lung tumour resection patient without COPD . Pulmonary pre-capillary endothelial smooth muscle cell isolate , maintained culture store low passage number liquid nitrogen . Two piece lung parenchyma snap frozen RNA isolation protein extraction ; one piece fix paraformaldehyde process immunohistochemistry analysis .</detailed_description>
