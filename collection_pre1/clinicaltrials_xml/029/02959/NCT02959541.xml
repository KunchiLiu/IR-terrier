	<detailed_description>Cytotoxic treatment patient colorectal cancer ( CRC ) include various different drug 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) cornerstone regimen . Leucovorin ( LV ) frequently use part standard treatment regime advance CRC combination 5-FU . In numerous randomized clinical trial addition LV 5-FU show significantly improve antitumor activity prolong survival patient receive adjuvant chemotherapy treatment advance disease compare treatment 5-FU single drug therapy . In European country 5-FU give infusion 46 hour combination two hour infusion LV . This regime call deGramont schedule . In Nordic country , 5-FU LV often give bolus injection accord regime call Nordic FLV . Leucovorin prodrug metabolize methylenetetrahydrofolate ( mTHF ) order increase inhibition target enzyme thymidylate synthase ( TS ) . Due low concentration reduce folate form intracellular lack knowledge pharmacodynamics LV use infusion . When 5-FU/LV use today introduce technically possible measure different metabolite reduce folate blood tissue . In literature one publish reference measure blood concentration two hour infusion LV . However , recently possible separate quantitate different folate use sensitive Liquid Chromatography/Masspectrometry ( LC/MS ) method . Furthermore stated difference enzyme activity gene involve transport metabolism folate may responsible large inter individual difference folate tissue concentration . This study design gain understand single intravenous infusion LV affect folate concentration blood , tumor adjacent mucosa tissue . By use LC/MS method recently develop possible quantitate different metabolite LV small tissue sample well blood . It possible measure quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction technique ( PCR ) important gene involve folate transport metabolism ( ( SHMT1 ) , SerineHydroxyMethylTransferase1 ( ABCC3 ) ATP-binding cassette , sub-family C , ( CFTR/MRP ) , member 3 ) ) .</detailed_description>
