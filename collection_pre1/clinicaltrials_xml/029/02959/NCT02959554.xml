	<brief_title>Study Which Therapy Either Switched Nivolumab After 3 Months Treatment Therapy Continued With Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Patients With Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma ( RCC ) Disease Control</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , open-label , phase II trial . Patients advance metastatic renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) randomize two arm either receive Nivolumab continuation Tyrosin Kinase Inhibitor ( TKI ) treatment receive 1st-line therapy . Patients must receive first line therapy VEGFR-TKI ( Sunitinib Pazopanib ) prior study inclusion 10-12 week document disease control ( PR/SD ) accord RECIST 1.1 time study entry . Eligible patient randomize 1:1 either Nivolumab TKI arm . Dosage Nivolumab : 240 mg i.v . D1 every cycle ( Q2W ) 16 week . After 16 week 480 mg i.v . D1 every cycle ( Q4W ) disease progress , intolerable toxicity , withdrawal consent end study . Dosage Sunitinib : According Standard Care ( SOC ) . Recommended dose 50 mg p.o . daily 4 consecutive week follow 2-week rest period ( schedule 4/2 ) comprise complete cycle 6 week ( disease progress , intolerable toxicity , withdrawal consent end study. ) . Dosage Pazopanib : According Standard Care ( SOC ) . Recommended dose 800 mg p.o . daily continuously ( disease progress , intolerable toxicity , withdrawal consent end study . ) .</detailed_description>
