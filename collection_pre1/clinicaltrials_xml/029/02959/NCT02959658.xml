	<brief_title>Dimethyl Fumarate Treatment Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple sclerosis ( MS ) chronic , inflammatory disease central nervous system presume caused T cell-mediated autoimmune process . PPMS register treatment option symptomatic treatment exists . Progressive form MS characterize clinically gradual symptom development without superimposed relapse . Fumarates long know disease-attenuating effect psoriasis . They routine use dermatology Germany several decade . Dimethyl fumarate interesting property combine immunological effect , least partly mediate interference nuclear factor kappa B transcription factor , also anti-oxidative neuroprotective effect mediate activation transcription factor Nuclear factor ( erythroid-derived 2 ) -Related Factor 2 ( NRF2 ) . Dimethyl fumarate currently approve treatment relapsing-remitting MS European medicine Agency dose 240 mg twice per day . Neurofilament light chain ( NFL ) treatment responsive biomarker neuronal axonal death appear cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) associate long-term prognosis MS . The concentration often elevate progressive MS patient . Treatment effect measure measuring change neurofilament light chain concentration course 48 week treatment either active drug placebo .</detailed_description>
