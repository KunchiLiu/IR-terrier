	<brief_summary>In patient resectable pancreatic duct adenocarcinoma ( PDAC ) , curative surgery follow adjuvant chemotherapy currently standard care . However , long-term result still poor , median disease-free overall survival 14 month 23 month . The corresponding 5-year overall survival rate 20 % . Chemotherapy surgery ( neoadjuvant chemotherapy ) allow identification patient rapidly progressive metastatic disease time preoperative restaging ( surgery avoid patient ) , may increase rate free margin resection ( R0 ) reduce risk local recurrence . Even though single-agent gemcitabine 5-FU validate adjuvant metastatic setting , objective response low ( around 10 % ) , whereas combination chemotherapy exceed response rate 30 % advanced disease . In metastatic PDAC , palliative FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy demonstrate effective ( term response rate progression-free survival ) well tolerate . Interestingly , response rate increase use two chemotherapeutic agent advance pancreatic cancer , justify use alternative neoadjuvant FOLFOX-based chemotherapy arm . PANACHE-01 open , non-comparative , randomise , multicentre Phase II study design assess safety efficacy two mode neo-adjuvant chemotherapy ( FOLFIRINOX &amp; FOLFOX ) relative current reference treatment ( surgery adjuvant chemotherapy ) resectable PDAC . Patients immediately resectable PDAC ( definition base NCCN 's ( American National Comprehensive Cancer Network 2014 ) late guideline ) randomise either pancreatectomy adjuvant chemotherapy 4 cycle neoadjuvant chemotherapy either FOLFOX FOLFIRINOX . The patient neoadjuvant chemotherapy arm receive postoperative chemotherapy 4 month ( 8 cycle ) .</brief_summary>
