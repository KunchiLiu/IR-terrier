	<brief_title>Effectiveness Safety Evaluation Aqueduct 100-device</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There predominantly two major dilatation technique employ dilate cervix . The first technique use expansible dry solid material , laminaria ( seaweed ) insert cervix dry stiff form . In cervix come contact body fluid cause laminaria swell enlarge cervical cavity . The second widespread procedure , involve use series solid , rod like instrument graduate diameter use serial fashion physician ( Hegar dilator ) . The physician first insert rod like dilator replaces dilator next high diameter . This procedure continue adequate dilatation occur . The Problem above-mentioned method shortcoming : use laminaria method ( rarely do ) require preliminary patient visit , insertion laminaria rod extremely slow typically involve often much 10-12 hour significant amount dilatation occur . The use rod-like instrument ( Hegar ) require general regional anesthesia , local anesthetic use , patient nevertheless frequently experience great amount discomfort procedure . The mechanical dilatation cervix demand large amount longitudinal force may damage even puncture cervix uterus . Aqueduct 100 catheter use dilate various body cavity especially human cervix . The device enable continuous , fast safe dilatation cervix pre-determined diameter pre-procedure intrauterine surgery .</detailed_description>
