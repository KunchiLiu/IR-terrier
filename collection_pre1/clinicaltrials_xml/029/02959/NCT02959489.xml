	<brief_title>Risk Evaluation Education Alzheimer 's Disease - Study Communicating Amyloid Neuroimaging ( REVEAL-SCAN )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) brain disease common form dementia . Clinical trial prevention AD move enroll subject increasingly earlier time-points , focus upon individual cognitively normal also biomarkers associate increase risk develop AD . Detecting one specific biomarker brain scan , i.e . amyloid-beta protein , currently use inform diagnose cognitively impaired individual , use may expand pre-clinical AD case preventive therapy develop . In REVEAL-SCAN clinical trial , investigator examine psychological behavioral impact learn `` elevate '' `` elevate '' amyloid neuroimaging result pertain risk progress Alzheimer 's disease dementia age 85 among cognitively normal old adult . The study 's goal learn communicate amyloid brain scan result risk develop AD dementia age 85 diverse population cognitively normal old adult . Findings relevant future decision-making research trial clinical practice . Study sit enroll old , cognitively normal individual ( 270 total ) use APOE genotyping enrich enrollment sample roughly half scan elevated amyloid brain scan result half scan elevate amyloid result . From enriched sample , participant ( approximately 25 % African-American ) receive Alzheimer 's Disease Dementia Risk Assessment base know risk factor . Half participant randomize also learn amyloid brain scan result time , half learn scan result 6 month later . Cognitive , psychological , behavioral outcome compare two group . Participants follow 9 month 7 in-person visit 5 phone call . REVEAL-SCAN first multisite randomized clinical trial explore benefit , risk limitation disclose amyloid result , help researcher clinician understand downstream implication emerge technology become increasingly utilized compile comprehensive neuroimaging profile old adult risk develop Alzheimer 's disease dementia .</detailed_description>
