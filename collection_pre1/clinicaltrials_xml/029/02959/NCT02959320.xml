	<brief_summary>Displaced femoral neck fracture one group hip fracture patient commonly treat cement hemiarthroplasty ( HA ) total hip arthroplasty ( THA ) . In elective hip arthroplasty population , direct anterior approach ( DAA ) show effective help patient quickly obtain high postoperative function . This approach also show effective arthroplasty displace femoral neck fracture study . However , study directly compare two approach hip arthroplasty femoral neck fracture utilize anterolateral approach ( ALA ) versus posterior approach ( PA ) DAA versus PA. No study aware directly compare DAA ALA . The DAA ALA two popular approach bipolar hemiarthroplasty institution , set determine difference .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Displaced femoral neck fracture one group hip fracture patient commonly treat cement hemiarthroplasty ( HA ) total hip arthroplasty ( THA ) . Compared receive THA , recipients HA tend less active , debilitate , dependent gait aid care others . In population , increase stability decrease operating time associate HA think important minimal increase function population could achieve THA . Additionally , cement femoral stem HA think result less pain , increase function , less periprosthetic fracture risk compare cementless stem . With relative pre-injury debility femoral neck fracture population , especially receive HA , important optimize aspect patient care allow participate therapy return preoperative functional level quickly possible . Furthermore , intervention population minimize physiologic insult surgery much possible . In elective hip arthroplasty population , direct anterior approach ( DAA ) show effective help patient quickly obtain high postoperative function . This approach also show effective arthroplasty displace femoral neck fracture study . However , study directly compare two approach hip arthroplasty femoral neck fracture utilize anterolateral approach ( ALA ) versus posterior approach ( PA ) DAA versus PA. No study aware directly compare DAA ALA . The DAA ALA two popular approach bipolar hemiarthroplasty institution , investigator set determine difference .</detailed_description>
