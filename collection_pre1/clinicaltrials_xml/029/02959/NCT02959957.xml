	<brief_title>Disturbance Intestinal Microbiota Temocillin v Cefotaxime Treatment Febrile Urinary Tract Infections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Temocillin narrow spectrum antibiotic activity gram negative bacteria inclusive many ESBL produce bacteria . Temocillin approve marketed European country since 1980´s Sweden . The aim study find ecological favorable alternative cephalosporin treatment common indication . The hypothesis treatment temocillin cause less disturbance intestinal microbiota least comparable efficacy . The study perform open prospective multicentre study two parallel group compare 2 g temocillin three time daily 1-2 g cefotaxim three time daily 7-10 day male female adult patient febrile urinary tract infection .</detailed_description>
