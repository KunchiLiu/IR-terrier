	<brief_summary>This Prospective open-label , comparative pivotal study comparison self-assessments blind investigator assessment . Pregnant woman attend labor delivery unit hospital emergency clinic reporting unidentified wetness ( undetermined whether amniotic fluid leakage urinary incontinence ) enrol study . After informed consent obtain , subject give single AL-SENSE use 12 hour perception wetness . Product Usage After usage , subject read record occurrence color change AL-SENSE 10 minute liner removal mark change color blue green designate form . The subject fill questionnaire regard product usage experience liner color reading help investigator , validate IFU reading comprehension . A blinded clinician perform `` standard clinical diagnosis '' ( clinical assessment ) . The standard clinical diagnostic method include follow test : ( 1 ) Pooling test , ( 2 ) Ferning test , ( 3 ) pH test pH paper . A positive Pooling test and/or positive result pH test Ferning test define positive clinical test result .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pivotal Study Rx Al-Sense Liner Amniotic Fluid Leakage Screening</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study design demonstrate performance AL-SENSE develop Common Sense Ltd. safe effective use indicate patient may experience amniotic fluid leakage . The AL-SENSE extend shelf-life product technically simple , fast react , visually readable , therefore enable woman test cause unidentified wetness , confirmation physician . Principles operation : Vaginal fluid discharge time collect non-intrusive panty liner . If user observe blue green stain , result test positive . The AL-SENSE polymer matrix stain blue green color pale yellow background pH level fluid contact great cutoff value . The AL-SENSE indicate pH level elevate level equal great 6.5 . This choice 6.5 unit cutoff level limit case false positive reduce unnecessary alarm . Summary Study Design Design : Prospective open-label , comparative pivotal study comparison self-assessments blind investigator assessment . Patient Population : Pregnant woman , age 18 . Baseline/ Screening Subjects attend labor delivery unit hospital emergency clinic reporting unidentified wetness ( undetermined whether amniotic fluid leakage urinary incontinence ) enrol study . After informed consent obtain , subject give single AL-SENSE use 12 hour perception wetness . The clinician explain proper use handle AL-SENSE read result . The participant provide instruction use also direct read Instructions For Use ( IFU ) prior apply AL-SENSE pad . Product Usage After usage , subject read record occurrence color change AL-SENSE 10 minute liner removal . The subject fill questionnaire regard product usage experience liner color reading help investigator , validate IFU reading comprehension . Clinical Diagnosis A blind clinician perform `` standard clinical diagnosis '' ( clinical assessment ) , record result worksheet include case report form . The standard clinical diagnostic method include follow test : ( 1 ) Pooling test , ( 2 ) Ferning test , ( 3 ) pH test pH paper .</detailed_description>
