	<brief_summary>Concussion common type brain injury throughout life . Study seek improvement long-term residuum follow adolescent adult post-traumatic injury often associate contact sport accidental cause . Typically define reversible head injury temporary loss brain function . Symptoms range physical , cognitive , pain ( headache ) emotional sign consistent TBI Post-Traumatic Stress Syndrome . Use AD-cSVF parenteral delivery encourage repair damage decrease function follow concussion , particularly contact , repetitive sport injury . Range damage measure Grade I-III accord graduate severity . Unfortunately , less information available repetitive concussion long-term health issue .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Concussion Syndrome ( CS ) TBI common injury produce temporary long-term damage impact brain function . Symptoms sometimes transient , sometimes long-term depend severity and/or repetitive damage . Signs vary recurrent headache , mental fog , emotional change physical sign loss consciousness , amnesia behavioral change ( irritability , loss concentration ability , etc . ) , cognitive impairment ( slow reaction time , memory loss ) , recur sleep disturbance . Common cause include sport injury , automobile accident , fall , blunt trauma head , explosive/blast injury production acceleration injury Treatment often involve monitoring , physical rest , limit cognitive activity ( compute , video game , texting , study ) . Most often single episode usually resolve improve ( particularly recur headache ) within 3-4 week . It estimate &gt; 6/1000 occurrence rate apply . Repetitive injury seem make person susceptible additional damage , particularly injury precedes resolution earlier damage . There appear also make person require less impact produce degree severity . It become recognize repeated concussion increase risk later life dementia , Parkinson 's severe depression . Most serious sign evaluate loss consciousness , seizure , worsen headache , diplopia/pupil change , loss recognition , vomit , focal neurological problem , change personality . There consensus definition concussion TBI . Most concussion consider mild TBI ( mTBI ) group , rarely demonstrate structural brain damage acute subacute state . Late brain MRI change difficult clearly point identify specific area presume damage . This study intend examine safety efficacy parenteral introduction AD-cSVF case CS TBI , categorically examine outcome accord elapsed time original concussive event . No delineation recurrent damage injury make within study .</detailed_description>
