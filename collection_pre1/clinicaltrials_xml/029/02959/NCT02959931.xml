	<detailed_description>Many study show increase potassium diet potassium pill help low blood pressure . Also , amount oral potassium take improve well participant blood vessel work . These study focus potassium give form pill . The investigator interested effect potassium consume food source effect arterial health blood pressure . The world health organization ( WHO ) recommend K⁺ intake least 3510 mg/day food adult , exclude impaired K⁺ excretion . In study investigator aim provide approximately 75 % ( approximately 2000 mg ) total daily recommend intake potassium one meal . The investigator know whether dietary potassium ( pill form ) acutely improve arterial health cause decrease blood pressure . The investigator hypothesis see improvement vascular function follow high potassium meal compare low potassium meal .</detailed_description>
