	<detailed_description>By time Alzheimer 's Dementia ( AD ) relate disorder diagnose , brain sustain substantial insult limit efficacy current treatment . Preventive intervention urgently need majority prevention study require large number participant , long follow-up period , frequent study visit . It feasible many geriatric patient attend clinic treatment daily basis due mobility transportation restriction , associate cost , lack rural clinic location . Interventions deliver remotely , administer within individual 's home , allow preventative treatment make accessible wider range individual . Thus , overall goal project assess feasibility impact design implement at-home intervention aim prevent long-term cognitive decline improve cognition individual currently at-risk develop AD . These high-risk individual target proposal : ( 1 ) old adult Mild Cognitive Impairment ( MCI ) , ( 2 ) old adult Major Depressive Disorder ( MDD ) , ( 3 ) old adult MCI MDD . The propose intervention combine cognitive remediation ( CR ) non-invasive brain stimulation - transcranial Direct Current Stimulation ( tDCS ) , deliver participant ' home environment . Twenty couple ( 40 participant ) recruit , one member define `` patient '' second member define `` caregiver '' patient . These caregiver facilitate delivery study intervention ( i.e. , CR+tDCS ) . Participants diagnosis MCI MDD , caregiver , receive open-label , active CR+tDCS period 8 week . Both CR tDCS show induce neuroplasticity improve cognition . The aim pilot study assess feasibility deliver combined intervention home .</detailed_description>
