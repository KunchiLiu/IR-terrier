	<brief_title>Acupuncture Point P6 Stimulation Reduction Nausea Vomiting During Cesarean</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The design study consist randomization subject undergoing cesarean section regional anesthesia one three group . The study blind ; participant know method treat difference site nature acupuncture point P6 stimulation . The randomization patient do computer avoid bias informed consent form ( ICF ) sign patient . The computer generate three set random number three group . Once consent form sign , investigator allocate patient serially group number . The randomization create study begin assign 180 subject one three group receive treatment follow : Group I ( n=60 ) : Will control group patient give traditional medical therapy receive acupuncture point P6 stimulation prior administration standardize epidural anesthesia , outline . Group II ( n=60 ) : Will receive traditional medical management , consist 10 mg metoclopramide IV 8 mg ondansetron IV immediately prior administration standardize regional anesthesia , outline . Group III ( n=60 ) : Will receive acupuncture point P6 stimulation . This stimulation chi channel master heart ( MH8 position ) small depression volar surface distal right forearm crest wrist . The device put patient operate room prior administration regional anesthesia remove cesarean section complete . The device remove patient operating room , patient transport recovery room . Patients receive continuous stimulation level comfortable patient prior administration standardize regional anesthesia , outline . After subject randomly assign one three group , subject receive standardize regional anesthesia consist 2 milliliter ( 10 milligram ) 0.5 % bupivicaine 20 microgram fentanyl 100 microgram epinephrine . Patients offer subjective assessment level nausea scale 0-10 ( 0 = nausea , 10 = worst nausea every experienced ) . An Apfel score , use predict risk experience post-operative nausea vomiting ( PONV ) , also determine subject .</detailed_description>
