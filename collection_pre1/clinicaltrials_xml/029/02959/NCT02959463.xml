	<brief_title>Adjuvant Pembrolizumab After Radiation Therapy Lung-Intact Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign 1 2 group . Your doctor decide group . Up 12 participant enrol group . If enrol Group A , already receive least 2 cycle chemotherapy possibly lung-sparing surgery . You receive radiation therapy one side chest , thorax , technique call `` hemithoracic radiation . '' You receive pembrolizumab . If enrol Group B , may may chemotherapy immunotherapy . You receive surgery . You receive radiation therapy course 1-3 week region include entire side chest , thorax . You receive pembrolizumab . Study Drug Administration : In group , receive pembrolizumab vein 30 minute Day 1 3-week cycle radiation therapy , 2 year . Study Visits : When receive radiation , visit every 3 week receive immunotherapy : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 1-2 tablespoon ) draw check immune system , side effect , check status disease . You CT and/or PET scan check status disease radiation therapy , Cycle 4 , every 3 cycle thereafter . If doctor think need , may extra image . You PFT check lung function Cycle 7 every 6 cycle . End-of-Study Visit : When stop receiving study drug : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 1-2 tablespoon ) draw check immune system , side effect , check status disease . - You PFT check lung function . Length Study : You may continue take study drug 2 year . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . If disease appear get bad tumor appear get large , may still able receive study drug doctor decide best interest . Sometimes disease appear get bad study drug actually work . However , risk continue receive study drug disease may actually get bad . You still risk side effect due study drug . This could also delay start treatment . The disease may get bad point longer able receive treatment . If choose receive study drug disease get bad , continue study visit describe . The study doctor discus option . Your participation study follow-up visit . Follow Up : About 30 day last dose study drug , physical exam . About every 12 week last dose pembrolizumab : - You physical exam . - You may CT PET scan check status disease . - If doctor think need , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) may draw routine test . - At Weeks 12 24 , PFTs perform . If unable make visit , contact phone check health . This investigational study . Radiation therapy deliver use FDA-approved commercially available method local control metastatic primary tumor . Pembrolizumab FDA approve commercially available treatment unresectable metastatic melanoma , lung cancer . Its use study investigational . Up 24 participant take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
