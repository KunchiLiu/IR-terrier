Secondary endpoint include change peak calf muscle perfusion thigh cuff occlusion/hyperemia , 6-minute walk distance , blood biomarkers ( LDL cholesterol , fibrinogen , high sensitivity c-reactive protein ( hs-CRP ) , lipoprotein ( ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial Alirocumab Plaque Regression Peripheral Arterial Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PAD characterize low limb arterial obstruction due atherosclerosis . There 8.5 million people PAD U.S . Recent data general population 40 demonstrate incidence PAD define ankle brachial index ( ABI ) 4.3 % . Another study 3000 patient , mean age 59 , demonstrate prevalence 3.9 % . The prevalence age-dependent , rise 14.5 % 70 . In population risk include diabetic smoker , incidence nearly 30 % . Standard cardiovascular ( CV ) risk factor also risk PAD , especially smoke , diabetes , hypertension , African-American race chronic kidney disease . The annual rate CV event include myocardial infarction , stroke , CV death 5-7 % . The adjusted risk die CV event 2-fold high without PAD . Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) method accurately quantify atherosclerotic plaque superficial femoral artery ( SFA ) patient PAD . These measure perform rapidly reproducibly intraclass correlation 0.997 intraobserver reproducibility , 0.987 intraobserver , 0.996 test-retest reproducibility , Plaque regression statin show use technique PAD . Alirocumab PCSK9 inhibitor effectively reduce LDL cholesterol 70 % patient statins intolerant statin . This injectable agent proven safe well-tolerated , yet study specifically patient peripheral arterial disease.The study double blind , placebo-controlled , randomize study Alirocumab vs. placebo 54 patient PAD . Baseline visit : Informed consent sign . Vital sign take blood drawn fast baseline value . A MRI would perform black blood image SFA leg . Approximately 10-15 cm leg would cover , use specifically design surface coil ( Machnet , Leiden , NL ) . The imaging would start bifurcation common femoral proceed distally . The pulse sequence use black blood turbo spin echo proton density weight sequence 3mm slice thickness 3mm gap subsequently interleave . A single slice extensive amount plaque choose image plaque characteristic include T1- T2-W imaging . Finally , calf muscle perfusion study perform leg symptomatic and/or low ABI absence claudication symptom . The calf wrap flexible surface coil 3T scanner . Subjects place supine MR scanner calf magnet isocenter . A thigh cuff inflate 250 mmHg 5 min . Arterial spin label image mid-calf obtain immediately release cuff.Regions interest draw relative blood flow map correspond calf muscle group measure perfusion ml/min/100g . Randomization : The study statistician block randomization let pharmacy know . Patients treatment group begin treatment alirocumab match placebo , 150 mg subcutaneously every 2 week . Treatment continue 26 treatment 1 year . Final Visit : This repeat initial visit vital sign , blood draw lipid panel , repeat MRI exact protocol initial visit .</detailed_description>
