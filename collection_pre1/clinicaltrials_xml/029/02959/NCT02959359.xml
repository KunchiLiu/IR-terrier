	<detailed_description>Chronic hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection major etiology hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) . For early stage HCC , surgical resection radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) mainstay curative treatment . However , recurrence still major issue surgery RFA . According previous report , cumulate recurrence rate small HCV-HCC 72.4 % 5 year . PEG-interferon plus RBV treatment standard care chronic hepatitis C ( CHC ) Taiwan . NHIRD data show PEG-IFN plus RBV treatment reduce 12 % recurrence rate 5 year ( 64 % vs 52 % ) curative resection HCC . However , select patient eligible tolerable IFN-based treatment surgical resection sustain virological response vary . Harvoni genotype 1 HCV sovaldi plus ribavirin genotype 2 HCV achieve high SVR recommend AASLD EASL . All-oral regimen , tolerable effective HCC patient curative treatment IFN-based treatment . Mixed HCV genotype infection account 10 % CHC patient Taiwan . Sovaldi-based treatment plus ribavirin effective Sovaldi plus rivavirin treatment genotype 2 HCV , well mixed genotype 1 2 HCV infection . As genotype 1 2 lead HCV genotype Taiwan , It simplify regimen anti-HCV treatment Taiwan use Harvoni plus ribavirin , genotype 1 2 HCV also mix genotype 1 2 HCV infection . Although unexpected high recurrence rate HCC patient DAA treatment report . However , one recent study show low risk HCC recurrence DAA treatment . Harvoni all-oral regimen , tolerable effective HCC patient surgery IFN-based treatment . The oral regimen would beneficial eradicate HCV viral load subsequently reduce risk recurrence curative resection HCV-HCC . In study , investigator plan enroll 130 HCV-HCC patient confirm curative treatment HCC , either surgery RFA . For case fulfil inclusion/exclusion criterion , 12 week Harvoni plus ribavirin treatment provide case ( single arm design ) . The primary objective study annual recurrence-free survival curative resection HCV-HCC 5 year . The secondary objective study SVR 4/12/24 DAA , regression fibrosis , incidence liver-related complication ( EV bleeding , ascites ) DAA treatment , overall survival 5 year . A hospital-based cohort HCV-related HCC undergo surgical resection RFA Taipei Veterans General Hospital Investigated Sites recruit historical control . The historical control include HCV-HCC undergoing curative treatment without Peg-interferon plus ribavirin treatment ( cohort 1 ) Peg-interferon plus ribavirin treatment ( cohort 2 ) curative treatment ( surgical resection RFA ) HCC .</detailed_description>
