	<brief_title>Outcome Percutaneous Mechanical Thrombectomy Treat Acute Deep Venous Thrombosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The conventional treatment acute deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) anticoagulation therapy , recommend international guideline . Anticoagulation prevents recurrent venous thrombosis , pulmonary embolism , death . Early thrombus removal consider standard medical care deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) . Early thrombus removal offer potential early restoration venous patency preservation valve function . Percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy ( PMT ) use number catheter-based mechanical device deliver thrombolytic agent well produce combination thrombus fragmentation , distribution thrombolytic drug throughout thrombus , and/or thrombus aspiration . The purpose study compare efficacy Percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy ( PMT ) follow standard anticoagulant therapy , anticoagulation therapy alone , treatment acute proximal low extremity deep vein thrombosis .</detailed_description>
