	<brief_summary>Background : Insertion central venous catheter ( CVC ) could lead variety complication . To detect complication , Chest X-ray ( CXR ) still reference standard . However , major limitation perform CXR 's critical care set . Aim/objectives : The objective study compare use bedside ultrasound ( US ) conventional CXR visualization accuracy safety CVC placement . The aim eventually replace X-ray bedside ultrasound gold standard confirmation CVC-placement critically ill patient , thereby reduce radiation exposure unnecessary delay CVC use . Methods : The bedside US perform student attend physician , blind CXR finding . After US examination , attend physician ( student ) fill structure form , base establish protocol . CXR perform US examination assess radiologist . The radiologist blind finding bedside ultrasound prevent bias . Final diagnosis determine examination complete medical chart .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Most patient admit intensive care unit undergo central venous catheterization ( CVC ) already receive CVC . Over 5 million CVC placement perform year United States . An indication central venous access example peripheral vein inaccessible administration potent vasoactive drug norepinephrine dopamine . Three anatomical site frequently use insert CVC : subclavian , jugular femoral site . Although central venous catheterization offer multiple advantage , associate adverse event could hazardous patient . Mechanical , infectious thrombotic complication could occur . Most common mechanical complication include arterial puncture , hematoma pneumothorax . Besides mechanical complication , malposition CVC could also lead complication , include phlebitis , perforation , venous thrombosis occlusion . Malposition CVC tip right atrium could also lead arrhythmia . The frequency primary mal-positioning show 3.7 % . A recent multicenter trial , include 3471 catheter 3027 patient , show subclavian-vein catheterization associate low risk bloodstream infection symptomatic thrombosis involve high risk pneumothorax compare jugular-vein femoral-vein catheterization . The risk mechanical complication subclavian , jugular femoral catheterization 2.1 % , 1.4 % 6 % respectively . To date , post-procedural chest X-ray ( CXR ) reference standard detect mechanical complication . Some study suggest consider reliable procedure detect complication absence clinical symptom . In addition , read bedside CXR alone accurate identify intra-atrial tip position . The exceedingly low complication rate right internal jugular vein catheterization suggest , detect pneumothorax intra-atrial malposition , routine post-procedure CXR neither necessary accurate cause delay catheter use . Omitting need CXR could reduce healthcare cost well . Due clear advantage , already increase role ultrasonography critical care set . In comparison radiography , advantage ultrasound patient expose radiation , often faster perform . Compared traditional 'blind ' landmark method , ultrasound-guided subclavian cannulation reduces fail catheterization complication associate subclavian catheterization . Advantages ultrasound-guided cannulation include correct identification vein , detect variable anatomy reduce event arterial puncture . Due develop knowledge technique ultrasound , suggest would suitable method replace CXR role detect pneumothorax identify CVC tip position . A small number study already demonstrated effect . In study evaluate use ultrasound diagnostic modality patient CVC placement subclavian jugular vein . This research proposal aim evaluate US examination diagnostic tool misplacement , bleed pneumothorax CVC-placement . Combining different strategy previous study . develop `` tHe UltraSound evaluation Cvc Insertion '' i.e . HUSCI-protocol . Hereby , aim improve accuracy The outcome measure sensitivity specificity US . In addition , diagnostic concordance US CXR patient CVC placement study . If US catch clinical relevant finding accurately replace standard expensive harmful CXR standard diagnostic tool patient CVC-placement future . We hypothesize US confirm correct CVC placement detect potential associate complication accurately .</detailed_description>
