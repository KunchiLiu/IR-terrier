	<detailed_description>Identification patient high risk heart attack important task emergency medicine physician . Currently , physician use variety different score system stratify risk heart attack . Heart rate variability ( HRV ) measure derive noninvasive cardiac monitoring . This data collect simple , non-invasive chest strap 10-minute recording session . The purpose proposal collect heart rate variability data patient admit emergency department chest pain . The intent measure association heart rate variability various risk stratification score system chest pain . The investigator propose enroll patient admit emergency department chest pain . In addition HRV data , clinical risk factor obtain , use validated clinical risk score system . The team follow patient 's clinical course order include information determine cause chest pain . The goal understand HRV augment common risk stratification score system patient present ED chest pain .</detailed_description>
