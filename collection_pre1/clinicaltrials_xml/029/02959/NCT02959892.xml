	<brief_title>A Single-Dose Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) Study Determine Effect TAK-041 Amphetamine-Induced Dopamine Release Central Nervous System ( CNS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug test study call TAK-041 . This study look brain penetration single oral dos TAK-041 effect amphetamine-induced dopamine release CNS . The study enroll participant 12 evaluable participant complete study procedure . The first 4 participant enrol study receive dose 20 mg TAK-041 0.50 milligram per kilogram ( mg/kg ) dose amphetamine . The dose subsequent participant determine base result amphetamine-induced dopamine release first 4 participant ( 5 40 TAK-041 0.25 0.50 mg/kg amphetamine ) . This multi-center trial conduct United Kingdom . The overall time participate study approximately 92 day . Participants remain confined clinic 3 4 day 2 confinement period .
