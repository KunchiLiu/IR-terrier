	<brief_title>A Study Chimeric Antigen Receptor T Cells Combined With Interventional Therapy Advanced Liver Malignancy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Designer T cell prepare PBMC patient suitable donator leukapheresis , activate re-engineered express chimeric antigen receptor ( CARs ) . There three option CAR-targets : GPC3 hepatocellular carcinoma ; mesothelin pancreatic cancer metastatic ; CEA colorectal cancer metastatic . Cells expanded culture return participant vascular interventional therapy intra-tumor injection dose （1.25~4）×107 CAR positive T cells/cm3 tumor bulk . The volume cell product time cell perfusion process last would depend way cell perfuse .</detailed_description>
