	<brief_title>Preventing Pressure Ulcers With Repositioning Frequency Precipitating Factors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose 9 nursing home ( NH ) cluster randomize study determine whether reposition frequency extend NH resident low , moderate , high risk pressure ulcer ( PrU ) development visco-elastic ( VE ) high-density foam support-surfaces without compromise PrU incidence . The investigator also determine change medical severity interact change risk level reposition schedule predict PrU development . PrUs result primarily pressure bony prominence occlude blood flow tissue . Current PrU prevention protocol recommend reposition moderate , high , severe risk resident minimum every 2 hour . The investigator propose include low risk resident study suggest develop PrUs . New pressure redistribution mattress may make 2 hour reposition unnecessary , optimal time reposition remains unclear . Aims 1 ) determine difference incidence new PrUs NH resident ( low , moderate , high risk level ) use VE surface reposition 2 , 3 , 4 hour frequency ; 2 ) determine medical severity component ( measure modify Comprehensive Severity Index ) , change clinically assess risk-level ( low , moderate , high measure Braden Scale ) , reposition schedule , interaction associate PrU development ; Exploratory Aim : Evaluate PrU prevention intervention approach NH group reposition 2 , 3 , 4 hour : 1 ) compare intervention resource cost ( VE surface , Leaf service/sensor use , fix variable labor cost train reposition ) incremental cost-effectiveness ratio cost per % reduction PrUs , 2 ) explore staff resident satisfaction intervention approach . The investigator randomly assign NH one 3 study arm ( 2 , 3 , 4 hour ) provide standard nursing care . Leaf Patient Monitoring System use sensor worn continuously monitor reposition . Periodic safety care check perform ensure skin integrity . Residents admit study NHs least 3 day 6 week intervention , without exist PrU , use specialty support surface , low , moderate , high risk PrU development include analysis base intention treat . The outcome , difference PrU incidence , determine whether reposition frequency extend low , moderate , high risk resident . Medical severity component clinically assess risk level examine assessment assessment change relation PrU development , thus identify severity component associate new PrUs . Data monitor investigator daily . Data analysis management perform HSIR . NH staff resident satisfaction intervention approach explore use focus group . This study advance knowledge reposition frequency clinically assess PrU risk-level relation medical severity . Outcomes research contribute future guideline precise preventive nursing practice refinement PrU prevention guideline .</detailed_description>
