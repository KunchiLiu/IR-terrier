	<brief_title>Impact Fever Prevention Brain Injured Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple study demonstrate fever / elevated temperature associate poor outcome brain injured patient ; however , conclusive study demonstrate fever prevention/controlled normothermia associate good outcomes . This study conduct assess impact advanced temperature control prevent fever brain injured patient . The fever prevention group use Arctic Sun Temperature Management System compare standard care patient fever may spontaneously develop . If fever develops patient standard care group , treat standard fever care measure accord step-wise algorithm , consist primarily intermittent antipyretic ( e.g. , acetaminophen ) cool blanket , necessary , advance targeted temperature management device .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Admitted primary neurological diagnosis ischemic stroke , intracerebral hemorrhage , subarachnoid hemorrhage 2 . Prior onset acute symptom , consider functionally independent ( mRS 02 ) 3 . Meets diseasespecific criterion 1 . Fever ( ≥38°C ) prior study enrollment 2 . Preexisting neurological , psychiatric , condition would confound neurological assessment would make difficult accurately assess neurologic and/or functional outcome 3 . Has premorbid condition poor likelihood survival 6 month 4 . Has premorbid mRS ≥3 5 . Diagnosed brain death 6 . Is undergoing therapeutic hypothermia therapy 7 . Has sustain neurological injury felt catastrophic little chance recovery 8 . Has skin condition use ArcticGel Pads contraindicate ( i.e. , skin sign ulceration , burn , hive , rash ) 9 . Has poor skin integrity poor tissue perfusion 10 . Participation concurrent investigational / interventional study ( medical device drug )</criteria>
