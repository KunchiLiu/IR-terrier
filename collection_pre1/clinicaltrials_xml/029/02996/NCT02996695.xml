	<detailed_description>The propose study single site , double-blinded , randomize , placebo-controlled clinical trial PfSPZ-CVac safety , tolerability , immunogenicity efficacy naturally occur malaria malaria-exposed Malian adult . The overall goal study evaluate regimen PfSPZ-CVac ( PfSPZ Challenge chemoprophylaxis ) safe , well-tolerated , provide sterile protection naturally-occurring malaria malaria-experienced adult . Participants receive three immunize PfSPZ Challenge injection via direct venous inoculation ( DVI ) four week apart chloroquine chemoprophylaxis . The PfSPZ Challenge dose 204,800 PfSPZ . This base result study Europe Africa . In T端bingen , Germany , 100 % malaria-na誰ve adult receive three dos 51,200 PfSPZ every four week chloroquine chemoprophylaxis protect homologous control human malaria infection ( CHMI ) . At time , study PfSPZ Vaccine malaria-experienced adult Mali Tanzania demonstrate high dos PfSPZ require demonstrate immunogenicity high grade protection malaria-experienced adult comparable achieve malaria-na誰ve adult study USA . For reason , dose select study four-fold high dose use T端bingen , Germany . Controls receive 0.9 % sodium chloride ( NaCl ) placebo . All participant receive standard chemoprophylactic regimen chloroquine ( CQ ) 10 week . Chloroquine give load dose ( 600mg chloroquine base ) two day first administration PfSPZ Challenge , follow weekly dos chloroquine ( 300mg chloroquine base weekly ) . Participants also treat 7-day regimen artesunate ( 200 mg per day ) last PfSPZ Challenge dose 204,800 sporozoite malaria parasite clearance , one week last CQ dose give . A total 62 participant randomize 1:1 ratio one two group inoculate PfSPZ Challenge 0.9 % NaCl DVI total 62 adult participate study . Participants recruit MRTC 's Bougoula-Hameau site . All volunteer recruit healthy adult age 18 45 year . Safety infectivity data collect . Volunteers , clinical laboratory investigator blind group allocation . Participants follow every four week last vaccination outpatient active malaria diagnosis treatment . Passive follow-up accomplish continuous availability study staff onsite diagnose treat malaria medical issue arise . The primary objective study assess safety tolerability PfSPZ Challenge compare placebo among malaria-experienced adult take chloroquine prophylaxis ( PfSPZ-CVac ) . The secondary objective : 1. ass protective efficacy PfSPZ-CVac naturally transmit P. falciparum malaria infection diagnose thick blood smear microscopy , 2 . To assess protective efficacy PfSPZ-CVac naturally transmit P. falciparum malaria infection diagnose qPCR , 3. ass expand efficacy PfSPZ-CVac compare placebo , 4. examine immune response P. falciparum malaria infection .</detailed_description>
