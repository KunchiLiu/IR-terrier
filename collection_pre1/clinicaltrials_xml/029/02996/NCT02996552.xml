	<brief_summary>The therapeutic strategy make patient ≤2 + functional tricuspid regurgitation ( TR ) extremely controversial : observational study suggest perform tricuspid annuloplasty patient undergoing mitral valve surgery dilate tricuspid ring , regardless degree failure , may provide clinical benefit , observational study benefit document . The ESC Guidelines assign class IIa recommendation patient tricuspid regurgitation≥ 2+ dilated annulus , surgery concomitant repair replacement mitral valve ; mean although debate still ongoing , experimental evidence expert opinion favor effectiveness usefulness intervention patient clinical feature . The aim study establish effectiveness tricuspid annuloplasty early stage . The investigator enrol patient TR≤2+ annular dilation undergo mitral valve repair . Primary end-point freedom recurrence TR≥3+ progression 2 degree compare pre-operative , discharge 12 month surgery , assessment transthoracic echocardiography . Secondary endpoint demonstrate superiority combine treatment ( M &amp; T Repair Group ) compare single treatment ( Mitral-Only Group ) 5 10 year surgery . This experimental superiority , prospective , spontaneous , single-center , randomized trial . Patients randomly assign two parallel arm allocation ratio 1:1 , receive mitral repair ( Mitral-Only group ) ore mitral tricuspid repair ( M &amp; T Repair group ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Annuloplasty Not-Severe TR Patient Undergoing MV Repair Versus Mitral Repair Only ( NOSTRUM )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current guideline recommend surgical treatment secondary tricuspid regurgitation ( TR ) patient mild moderate TR undergo mitral valve ( MV ) surgery significant dilatation tricuspid annulus document . Indeed , several observational series small randomized study show presence tricuspid annulus dilatation , treat less severe secondary TR may lead progression tricuspid disease despite correction associate left-sided lesion . The vast majority data , however , come series include patient functional mitral regurgitation ( MR ) include limited number . Only report describe evolution mild moderate TR context dilate cardiomyopathy ( DCM ) , result usually limit early mid-term follow-up . In past , concept less severe secondary TR decrease MV surgery alone widely accept size tricuspid annulus use guide decision-making process term TR correction . The aim study establish effectiveness tricuspid annuloplasty early stage . The investigator enrol patient TR≤2+ annular dilation undergo mitral valve repair . This single center single-blind parallel group randomize control trial . Patients randomly assign two parallel arm allocation ratio 1:1 , receive one two surgical procedure . Patients match inclusion criterion preoperative evaluation recruit . Patient randomize accord computer-generated list casual number . Information patient allocation keep closed opaque envelop nobody know patient allocation randomization . Patients blind allocation . The day surgery patient subsequently randomize two arm : 1 . M &amp; T Repair Group 2 . Mitral-Only Group Each group consist 71 patient . All patient receive mitral valve repair patient enrol M &amp; T Repair Group Edwards MC3 Tricuspid ring implant . Primary end-point freedom recurrence TR≥3+ progression 2 degree compare pre-operative , discharge 12 month surgery , assessment transthoracic echocardiography . Secondary endpoint demonstrate superiority combine treatment ( M &amp; T Repair Group ) compare single treatment ( Mitral-Only Group ) 5 10 year surgery . For statistical analysis data express `` average + - standard deviation '' percentage . A `` probability value '' le 0.05 consider `` statistically significant . '' Outcomes compare use `` X2 '' analysis categorical variable `` t-test '' continuous . The data analyze use SPSS version 11.5 ( SPSS Inc. , Chicago , IL , USA ) Windows ( Microsoft Corp , Redmond , WA ) . Survival freedom reoperation TR≥3+ TR progression &gt; 2+ compare preoperative , analyze method Kaplan-Meier . The analysis `` univariate '' possibly `` multivariate '' risk factor perform `` Cox proportional hazard regression '' .</detailed_description>
