	<brief_title>The Incidence Impact Vocal Cord Dysfunction In Patients Undergoing Thoracic Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives : Primary : Estimate prevalence vocal cord dysfunction thoracic surgery association vocal cord dysfunction immediate post operative respiratory complication thoracic surgery . Secondary : 1 . Estimate prevalence vocal cord dysfunction pre-operative patient population undergo thoracic surgery , i.e . baseline prevalence . 2 . Estimate incidence new vocal cord dysfunction post-operative period , i.e . incidence new dysfunction 3 . Estimate association vocal cord dysfunction respiratory , voice , swallow , mortality outcomes 4 . Estimate impact vocal cord immobility hospital length stay , ICU admission rate duration Population : All patient undergo thoracic surgery Health Sciences Centre Winnipeg , Canada . This tertiary care centre population-based referral base 1.5 million people Schematic Study Design : Enrollment Vocal Cord Mobility Assessment 1 Total N=141 : Obtain informed consent . Screen potential participant inclusion exclusion criterion ; obtain history Perform Flexible Nasolaryngoscopy otolaryngology resident , document videorecording Vocal Cord Mobility Assessment 2 Post operative day 1-2 Perform Flexible Nasolaryngoscopy otolaryngology resident , document videorecording Collection functional outcome Hospital Discharge Death Collection data respiratory , voice , swallow , cardiovascular mortality outcome , hospital length stay ICU admission duration Review Vocal Cord Mobility Assessment expert ( Laryngologist ) review videorecordings nasolaryngoscopy Statistical Analysis Final Assessments Association vocal cord immobility functional outcome death . 2.1 Background Information Research Question : In patient undergo thoracic surgery , incidence respiratory associate complication 30 day post-operative period among with/without Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve ( RLN ) Injury ? Background : The issue RLN injury important clinical challenge thoracic surgery , respiratory complication great source morbidity surgical population . Clinical care experience literature demonstrate high incidence respiratory complication ( 20-60 % incidence pneumonia esophagectomy 20 % death rate contract pneumonia ) post-operative thoracic surgery population . The thoracic surgery population uniquely elevate risk respiratory complication due high prevalence COPD , nature primary surgical procedure directly diminish pulmonary function toilet ; possible RLN injury . The modifiable element triad RLN injury , appear important element base clinical experience limit literature available . The RLN supply motor innervation vocal cord ; vocal cord closure consider important protective mechanism aspiration lung . Patients RLN injury demonstrate 5-fold risk contract pneumonia , 5-fold risk reintubation tracheostomy , 40-60 % long hospital stay patient without RLN injury . The current literature base substantially lack regard incidence RLN injury , estimate vary 4-80 % base retrospective review prospective study fail examine patient . The high quality study demonstrate RLN injury rate range 20-40 % major procedure esophagectomy pneumonectomy . With recent advent injection laryngoplasty vocal cord medialization , practical mean potentially alter course pathologic triad . This procedure perform bedside local anesthetic , allow early intervention high-risk population bulwark aspiration . Prospectively examine incidence pre post-operative vocal cord immobility thoracic surgery patient mean quantify health burden associate RLN injury . Potential Risks Potential risk study include time involve consider participation , provide consent data subjective voice quality undergo flexible nasolaryngoscopy assess vocal cord status . No health , economic legal risk anticipate participant . Potential Benefits No direct benefit , either monetary health improvement accrue patient participation study . Study Outcome Measures Vocal Cord Mobility - Flexible nasolaryngoscopy visualize mobility status vocal cord . Voice - Voice Handicap Index 10 . Validated instrument use subjective assessment voice , 10 plain language question answer patient . Respiratory : Incidence pneumonia ( define CDC criterion ) intubation Swallowing : Oral diet v NPO diet texture tolerate discharge Cardiovascular : Myocardial Infarction define third universal criterion 2012 third ESC/ACCF/AHA/WHF , Cerebrovascular Accident define WHO MONICA criterion Neurology specialist consultation</detailed_description>
