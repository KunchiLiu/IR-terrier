	<brief_summary>Background : AD-HIES disease weaken immune system . It put people risk infection , particularly Staph Candida infection . Researchers want test vaccine may help keep people get infection , would help people AD-HIES . Objective : To test new vaccine NDV-3A protection infection yeast Candida bacterium Staphylococcus aureus ( Staph ) . Eligibility : Adults age 18-55 AD-HIES Healthy volunteer age 18-55 Design : Participants 6-7 study visit 6-7 month . They also contact phone visit . Participants screen medical history , physical exam , blood urine test . Participants 2 baseline visit . They repeat screen test . They sample saliva , stool , skin , mucus ( oral , nasal , and/or vaginal ) collect . Any eczema skin look . Participants fill symptom diary card record feel . Participants NDV-3A vaccine inject muscle arm . Participants return next 2 day . They physical exam . Blood collect . Participants 2 follow-up visit NIH . They physical exam . They blood , saliva , stool , skin , vaginal fluid , and/or mucus sample collect . Participants call month 5 month vaccination . There optional visit 6 week vaccination . Participants provide blood sample visit ... .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety , Tolerability , Immunogenicity One Dose NDV 3A Vaccine People With STAT3-Mutated Hyper-IgE Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Autosomal-dominant hyper-IgE syndrome ( AD-HIES ) characterize recurrent Staphylococcus aureus Candida epithelial infection , think due , part , lack Th17 cell differentiation , thus impair epithelial immunity . Treatment AD-HIES primarily supportive prophylactic antibiotic ; however , limited microbial resistance intolerance medication , infection still occur . Immunological intervention vaccine could improve quality life prevent infection altogether . The NDV-3A vaccine consist recombinant protein derive Candida Als3 adhesion protein . This protein homologous surface protein S aureus show preclinical study protect intravascular subcutaneous challenge S aureus . Therefore , NDV-3A represent first antifungal vaccine , also first vaccine provide cross-kingdom protection . In Phase 1 Phase 2 study healthy volunteer ( 150 receive vaccine ) , safety profile vaccine reassure vaccine elicits strong antibody response single dose vaccinee well Th1 and/or Th17 response majority vaccinee . We enroll 20 healthy adult volunteer 20 adult AD-HIES open-label , single-dose study assess immunological response safety/tolerability NDV-3A vaccine . We anticipate increase baseline anti-Als3 IgG within 2 week post-vaccination .</detailed_description>
