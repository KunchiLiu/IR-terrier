	<brief_title>High-Volume Image-Guided Injection Chronic Midportion Achilles Tendinopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background study - Overuse injury Achilles tendon common entity athlete . Especially middle age athlete risk . Elite run athlete lifetime risk sustain Achilles tendon injury 52 % . At moment usual treatment chronic midportion Achilles tendinopathy excentric exercise program . In case give great result , however significant group patient exercise program sufficient . Three United Kingdom-based case series evaluate efficacy High-Volume Image-Guided Injections ( HVIGI 's ) chronic midportion Achilles tendinopathy . They show promising result . However none study use comparative group . There consequently lack high-quality study field therefore investigator recommend treatment yet indication . Objective study - To investigate efficacy high-volume image guide injection ( HVIGI ) chronic midportion Achilles tendinopathy . Hypothesis - The average VISA-A score higher patient group treat progressive exercise program combination high volume image guide injection comparison group treat low volume injection control group combination progressive exercise program . Study design - A double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled clinical trial . Randomization stratification ( base activity level use Ankle Activity Score ) perform use computer-generated model . Measurements perform baseline , 2 , 6 , 12 24 week post injection . At every time point primary secondary outcome measurement collect . The painDETECT Pain Coping Inventory questionnaires derive baseline 24 week post injection . Study population - In total , 80 patient clinically diagnose chronic midportion Achilles tendinopathy include study .</detailed_description>
