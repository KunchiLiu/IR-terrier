	<brief_summary>Background : Acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) cancer white blood cell . It fatal treat . Treatment AML respond treatment ( refractory ) return treatment ( relapse ) often work . Researchers want see immunotherapy drug , combine less intense chemotherapy , may able help . Objective : To test pembrolizumab , combination decitabine , possible treatment people relapse refractory AML . Eligibility : Adults 18 year age old refractory AML relapse AML . Design : Participants first screen eligibility . The study count 21-day cycle . The initial phase study consist 8 cycle . Participants may study 2 year respond treatment . The first 3 week treatment usually do hospital . The rest may do outpatient . Participants get pembrolizumab begin cycle IV . Participants usually get decitabine IV day 8 12 day 15 19 every cycle . Participants give blood sample . Participants bone marrow exam . A needle inserted hip extract cell bone marrow . Some participant may give sample saliva inside cheek . Some participant may give small skin sample . The top layer skin remove . Some patient may require leukapheresis start treatment . This procedure remove leukemia cell blood stream .</brief_summary>
