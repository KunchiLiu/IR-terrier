	<detailed_description>Cardiac CT angiography ( CCTA ) emerge powerful commonly use diagnostic tool evaluation coronary artery disease . Advantages CCTA non-invasive approach , widespread availability high negative predictive value rule coronary artery disease . However , radiation exposure CCTA need consider , due potential risk malignancy induction . A decade ago , multicentre observational PROTECTION I study reveal dose-length-product CCTA range 568-1259 mGy x cm median 885 mGy x cm . This correspond estimate effective dose approximately 12 mSv . Furthermore , PROTECTION I demonstrate 7-fold variation radiation dose different study site implicate large potential dose reduction . Finally , significant difference detect radiation exposures CT system different vendor application dose-saving algorithm , imply approach dose reduction respect hardware software also relevance 2007 . Since variety technique develop enhanced order reduce radiation exposure CCTA . Earlier , ECG-controlled tube current modulation accept reduce radiation dose therefore use ECG-gated retrospective cardiac spiral scanning . Another dose-saving technique reduction tube potential conventionally 120 kVp 100 kVp non-obese patient . In PROTECTION II trial demonstrate diagnostic image quality maintain reduction tube potential 100 kVp radiation exposure significantly reduce 31 % . Development prospective ECG-gated axial ( sequential ) scan allow dose reduction , due administration radiation end diastole . In PROTECTION III trial could demonstrate diagnostic image quality maintain prospective ECG-gated axial scanning patient stable low heart rate radiation exposure reduce 69 % compare conventional spiral scan retrospective ECG gating . Using prospectively ECG-triggered high-pitch spiral CCTA image acquisition one cardiac cycle , additional dosage may save use select patient low stable heart rate . However , scan strategy attempt high-pitch scan first vulnerable motion artefacts bear risk repeat scan . In PROTECTION IV trial compare scan strategy high-pitch helical scanning first conventional scan first strategy . We could demonstrate maintenance image quality use strategy high-pitch helical scanning first , radiation exposure reduce 57 % , compare conventional scan first strategy . The introduction iterative image reconstruction technique advance raw data process let improvement image quality compare traditional filter back projection . This allow additional dose save image acquisition . In PROTECTION V trial demonstrate feasibility combine iterative image reconstruction technique reduction tube current 30 % leading maintenance diagnostic image quality save radiation dose linearly tube current . In summary , four randomize clinical trial PROTECTION II-V demonstrate different technique reduce radiation exposure CCTA apply clinical practice without compromise diagnostic image quality . The study show different approach also apply combination approach use different CT platform different CT vendor . Recent study demonstrate effective radiation dose one CCTA scan may reduce 0,3 mSv15 even 0,1 mSv small amount carefully select patient . However , remain unclear dramatically low dosage achieve diagnostic image quality maintain clinical routine . In order analyze magnitude radiation dose exposure CCTA today 's clinical practice , design international multicentric PROTECTION VI study . We assess variation radiation dose respect vendor , CT system study site . Furthermore , evaluate usage dose save strategy include above-mentioned daily practice analyze effect diagnostic image quality . On basis collect data , evaluate potential use additional dose saving site individually .</detailed_description>
