	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine difference patient outcomes general anesthesia versus spinal anesthesia give addition popliteal adductor canal nerve block foot ankle surgery . Popliteal adductor canal nerve block injection local anesthetic agent near nerve back front knee go foot ankle provide numbness surgery . These peripheral nerve block offer good pain control reduce need opioids ( opioids pain medication morphine , Dilaudid , oxycodone ) . General anesthesia involve flow oxygen anesthesia gas tube , along additional intravenous medication , cause unconsciousness unawareness sensation surgery . Spinal anesthesia involve injection local anesthetic lower back , cause numbness waist . In addition spinal anesthesia , sedative typically give intravenously cause relaxation sleepiness throughout surgery . General , spinal , nerve block anesthesia routinely use surgery Hospital Special Surgery . General spinal anesthesia typically used addition peripheral nerve block foot ankle surgery 1 ) allow surgeon use thigh tourniquet reduce bleeding , 2 ) provide anesthesia earlier , 3 ) prevent unwanted movement . However , unclear whether general spinal anesthesia provide well patient outcome give peripheral nerve block . Some report show , spinal anesthesia advantage general anesthesia term side effect nausea pain . However , advantage may also gain combine peripheral nerve block general anesthesia . Spinal anesthesia associate headache backache , although headache backache also happen operation perform general anesthesia . A previous study Hospital Special Surgery show low rate nausea among patient receive nerve block spinal anesthesia , nausea among patient receive nerve block general anesthesia . Therefore , primary aim study determine , treatment , either general spinal anesthesia advantage treatment term readiness discharge , side effect , pain patient satisfaction ambulatory foot ankle population .</brief_summary>
