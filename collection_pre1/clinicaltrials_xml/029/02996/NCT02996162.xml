	<brief_title>The Natural Course Hypercapnia Its Association With Long-term Respiratory Morbidities Premature Infants With Chronic Lung Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Data collection begin infant long require mechanical ventilation , CPAP , HFNC , twice per week NICU . Investigators obtain twenty minute end-tidal capnography data , use Masimo ISA modules continuous CO2 display . Five minute good quality data , approximately 30 breath per minute , provide approximately 150 data point . After filter artifact , mean range end tidal CO2 record interval . These recording start feed infant receive enteral feed . The capnography cannula place bedside nurse respiratory therapist conclusion feed remove later next feed . If data unable obtain , investigator attempt collect next regularly schedule interval . Available blood gas pCO2 also record NICU hospitalization . After discharge , consent subject follow BCH outpatient pulmonary clinic capnography record every clinic visit period twenty minute , mean range end-tidal CO2 record filter artifact . Available blood gas pCO2 pulmonary visit record ; blood gas sick encounter ( i.e . emergency room ) exclude . From available electronic medical record ( EMR ) clinic note data , investigator also record duration time respiratory support include positive pressure ventilation nasal cannula oxygen .</detailed_description>
