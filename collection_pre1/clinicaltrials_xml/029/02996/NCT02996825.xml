	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose mirvetuximab soravtansine gemcitabine hydrochloride treat patient folate receptor ( FR ) alpha-positive ovarian , primary peritoneal , fallopian tube , endometrial , triple negative breast cancer come back . Monoclonal antibody , mirvetuximab soravtansine , may interfere ability tumor cell grow spread . Drugs use chemotherapy , gemcitabine hydrochloride , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spreading . Given mirvetuximab soravtansine gemcitabine may work well treat patient FRalpha-positive ovarian , primary peritoneal , fallopian tube , endometrial , triple negative breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mirvetuximab Soravtansine Gemcitabine Hydrochloride Treating Patients With FRa-Positive Recurrent Ovarian , Primary Peritoneal , Fallopian Tube , Endometrial , Triple Negative Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) recommend phase II dose ( RP2D ) gemcitabine hydrochloride ( gemcitabine ) give combination mirvetuximab soravtansine ( IMGN853 ) patient FRalpha-positive recurrent ovarian , primary peritoneal , fallopian tube , endometrial cancer , triple negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To explore toxicity , response rate ( RR ) progression free survival ( PFS ) three expand cohort heavily pre-treated FRalpha-positive ) TNBC patient ; b ) endometrial cancer patient ; c ) ovarian , primary peritoneal , fallopian tube cancer patient , treat initial recommend phase II dose . II . To provide additional safety data expand cohort help inform RP2D cohort . III . To evaluate relationship intratumoral level DM4 , tumoral expression FRalpha , plasma concentration DM4 48 72 hour follow first dose . IV . To determine pharmacokinetics ( PK ) DM4 gemcitabine give combination . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate role archival FRalpha expression substitute 48-72 hour ( H ) expression determine intratumoral concentration DM4 . OUTLINE : This dose escalation study . Patients receive mirvetuximab soravtansine intravenously ( IV ) day 1 gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 1 8 . Courses repeat every 3 week absence disease progression unexpected toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day every 12 week thereafter .</detailed_description>
