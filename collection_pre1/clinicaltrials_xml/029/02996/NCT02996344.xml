One Experimental learn group SP interaction person conduct remotely use secure webcam service ( OoVoo ) . All SP interaction record . Both group compare term suicide prevention skill use SP 'test case ' 6-month follow . The primary research question learn impact practice ( though SP simulation ) didactics alone . The hypothesis follow : H1 : All subject demonstrate improve suicide prevention knowledge pre post didactics maintain improvement 6 month didactics . H2 : Subjects experimental learn group report great satisfaction training , great self-efficacy identify respond patient risk suicide , great intention use , well use suicide prevention skill . H3 : Subjects experimental learn group also skillful respond patient risk suicide ( SP interview , measure objective observed rating ) compare control learn group 6 month didactics . Exploratory Aims : We examine moderator outcomes , difference among SP simulation ( i.e. , face-to-face vs. telehealth modality ) , growth improve skill observed multiple SP experience experimental learn group .</detailed_description>
