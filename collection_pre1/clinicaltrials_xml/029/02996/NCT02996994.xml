	<brief_title>Predictors Postoperative Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postoperative pain remain important consideration patient surgeon . Therefore , much attention bring toward investigate predictive factor postoperative pain . A systematic review 48 eligible study 23,037 patient show preexist pain , anxiety , age , type surgery four significant predictive factor intensity postoperative pain . However , paper evaluate type surgical approach . More recently , prospective observational study show preoperative State Trait Anxiety Inventory ( STAI ) Numerical Rating Scales ( NRS ) anxiety pain expectation independent predictor pain morphine consumption follow abdominal hysterectomy . To date , little known predictive factor postoperative pain urogynecologic patient population . The purpose study determine predictor postoperative pain specific urogynecologic patient population . We aim investigate relationship perioperative factor ( demographic medical history ) postoperative pain score postoperative day 1 patient undergone urogynecologic surgery , specifically vaginal reconstruction pelvic organ prolapse . This information would fill gap knowledge , would also allow u counsel patient accurately regard postoperative expectation . Furthermore , find positive correlation modifiable perioperative factor postoperative pain score , may able minimize effect future surgical case .</detailed_description>
