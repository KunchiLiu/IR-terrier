	<brief_title>Fractional Laser Assisted Steroid Therapy v Intralesional Steroids Treatment Keloids</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intralesional corticosteroid remain gold standard treatment keloid . However , effective therapy desperately desire . Ablative fractional laser ( AFL ) treatment facilitate delivery intralesional steroid deeply uniformly skin create vertical channel . Recent study show fractional laser assist steroid therapy effective treatment keloid . However study lack compare treatment modality gold standard intralesional steroid .</detailed_description>
