	<brief_summary>For preterm infant , defer cord clamp show improve short term long-term neonatal outcome without establish harm mother infant.The interference resuscitative measure neonate mother risk continue hamper implementation delay cord clamp many center around world.For reason , evidence seek time-honored , yet adopt method placental transfusion involve milk umbilical cord .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Deferred Cord Clamping Compared Umbilical Cord Milking Preterm Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Contrary delay cord clamping , milk umbilical cord do faster rate shorter time.Recent evidence demonstrate efficacy safety umbilical cord milk term preterm infants.A new evidence compare delay cord clamp umbilical cord milk preterm infant demonstrate high initial hemoglobin , blood pressure systemic blood flow preterm infant allocate umbilical cord milk arm.However , concern raise regard rapid infusion large volume blood relatively short time predispose hyperperfusion injury include intraventricular hemorrhage . This particularly problematic preterm neonates high risk neurological injury . It , though , advantage shorter timeframe allow effective resuscitation preterm neonates start soon possible . Thus , counter advantage disadvantage , practice adopt place . The author plan conduct randomize clinical trail compare efficacy safety umbilical cord milking defer cord clamp preterm infant le 32 week gestation .</detailed_description>
