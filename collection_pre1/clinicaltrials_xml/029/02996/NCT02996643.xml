	<detailed_description>Background : Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis ( AIS ) three-dimensional deformity spine associate vertebral rotation . Brace treatment commonly use non-surgical treatment . To obtain best possible outcome , best in-brace correction within patient 's accepted tolerance must provide . However , exist clinical practice , immediate in-brace correction measure design fit brace correction determine use radiograph . Objectives : The objective study use ultrasound method determine optimum tolerable applied pressure level provide maximum in-brace correction . Procedure : Control Group : In traditional method , brace construct use plaster cast patient 's trunk . Before plaster cast hardens , subject lie cast board multiple brace pad apply correct curve ( ) . The trim line , pad placement , area relief determined orthotist guide curvature see pre-brace PA spine radiograph . Intervention Group : Before apply plaster , subject lie custom design frame . Two ultrasound scan perform average Cobb value use baseline . Multiple adjustable brace pad , allow 6Â° freedom variable force , apply patient ' body accord orthotist suggestion . The apical brace pad use control major curve mark relative cast board reference location . The major pressure pad move 1 inch , 1 inch relative reference location . The 1 inch increment corresponds cast board , finer adjustment available . Two repeat ultrasound scan perform pad location ( total 3 location ) , average in-brace Cobb value estimate determine optimum apical brace pad location . Next , pressure increase incrementally tolerance level subject ; do inflate bladder apical brace pad . Another two ultrasound scan perform confirm maximum in-brace Cobb value obtain . The orthotist use configuration set pad size location plaster cast apply .</detailed_description>
