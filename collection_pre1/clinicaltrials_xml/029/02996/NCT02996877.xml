	<brief_title>Outcomes Percutaneous Revascularization Management Surgically Ineligible Patients With Multivessel Left Main Coronary Artery Disease : A Prospective Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives 1 . Compare 30-day mortality composite mortality morbidity follow high-risk percutaneous coronary revascularization predict Society Thoracic Surgeons ( STS ) survival morbidity patient severe multivessel leave main coronary artery disease ( CAD ) . 2 . Compare 12-month health status clinical outcome surgically ineligible multivessel leave main CAD patient treat PCI compare treat medical therapy alone . 3 . Understand association completeness revascularization long-term health status clinical outcome among patient multivessel leave main CAD treat PCI deem ineligible surgery . 4 . Compare 6-month 1-year survival among surgically ineligible high-risk PCI patient predict STS survival ( ASCERT risk model ) 5 . Determine justification surgical ineligibility cardiologist cardiac surgeon among patient severe multivessel leave main coronary artery disease ( CAD ) . 6 . Describe frequency predictor PCI versus medical management among surgically ineligible patient severe multivessel leave main CAD . 7 . Describe frequency predictor complete revascularization population . 8 . Describe cost cost per quality adjust life year ( QALY ) gain strategy management multivessel leave main CAD PCI versus medical therapy among surgically ineligible patient .</detailed_description>
