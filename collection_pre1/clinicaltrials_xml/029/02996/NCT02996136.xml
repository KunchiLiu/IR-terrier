	<detailed_description>This multicenter prospective study include nasal nasopharyngeal swab collect patient present flu-like symptom undergone routine test influenza virus strain type A B . The ARROW-FLU Influenza A &amp; B Test System qualitative result compare reference method identification Influenza A B determine clinical sensitivity specificity device . The ARROW-FLU Influenza A &amp; B Test system perform CLIA-waived non-CLIA waive clinical site . Device operator CLIA-waived site untrained intend user ( e.g . nurse , physician assistant , medical assistant , etc ) . A subject 's participation study consist single visit . Following completion inform consent process review Inclusion/Exclusion criterion determine eligibility , subject receive unique study identification number . After standard care sample , two ( 2 ) nasal nasopharyngeal swab obtain subject enrol study . The swab collect nostril alternate order designation test ( i.e . one ARROW-FLU Influenza System test reference test .
