	<detailed_description>Low 25 [ OH ] Vit D level become public epidemic increase recognition widespread insufficiency United States worldwide . Epidemiologic study associate low 25 [ OH ] Vit D level coronary risk factor adverse cardiovascular outcome . However , randomize trial need establish relevance 25 [ OH ] Vit D status cardiovascular health . While randomized trial evaluate vitamin D supplementation , none `` treat target '' ( i.e. , individual dosing adequate 25 [ OH ] Vit D level obtain ) , rather give `` blanket '' dose regardless 25 [ OH ] Vit D level .</detailed_description>
