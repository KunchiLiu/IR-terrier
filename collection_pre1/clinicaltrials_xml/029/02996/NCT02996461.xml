	<brief_summary>Background : People get Zika virus infect mosquito . They usually get sick . But birth defect report baby born mother Zika infection . In rare case , people Zika infection nervous system disease cause severe muscle weakness life threaten . A new vaccine make DNA code Zika virus protein could help body build immune response virus . Objectives : To see new vaccine Zika virus disease safe cause side effect . To study specific immune response vaccine . Eligibility : Healthy people age 18 50 Design : Participants screen : Medical history Physical exam Urine test Participants 18 visit 2 year . Participants randomly assign 1 3 group . All get 3 vaccine 3 separate monthly visit . They receive vaccine upper arm muscle . Some get needle syringe , others device use high pressure push vaccine skin . Vaccine visit last 4 6 hour . Participants get thermometer measure temperature ruler measure skin change injection site . They record data 7 day injection . Other visit last 1 2 hour . These include : Evaluation health change problem Blood test : Some sample may use future research . Participants side effect may extra visit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>VRC 320 : A Phase I , Randomized Clinical Trial Evaluate Safety Immunogenicity Zika Virus DNA Vaccine , VRC-ZKADNA090-00-VP , Administered Via Needle Syringe Needle-free Injector , PharmaJet , inHealthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>STUDY DESIGN : This Phase I , randomize clinical study evaluate safety , tolerability , immunogenicity 3 dose vaccination regimen Zika virus ( ZIKVwt ) DNA vaccine , VRC-ZKADNA090-00-VP . Subjects randomize one three group receive full 4 mg dose : 1 ) full dose one intramuscular ( IM ) injection needle syringe ; 2 ) split dose give two 0.5 mL IM injection needle syringe ; 3 ) split dose give two 0.5 mL IM injection PharmaJet , needle-free injection device . The primary hypothesis investigational ZIKVwt DNA vaccine safe well tolerate healthy adult . A secondary hypothesis vaccine elicit ZIKV-specific immune response . The primary objective evaluate safety tolerability vaccine healthy adult . Secondary objective related immunogenicity vaccine vaccination regimen . PRODUCT DESCRIPTION : The investigational vaccine , VRC-ZKADNA090-00-VP , develop Vaccine Research Center ( VRC ) , National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases ( NIAID ) , National Institutes Health ( NIH ) compose single closed-circular DNA plasmid ( VRC 5283 ) encode wild type ( wt ) precursor membrane M ( prM ) envelope ( E ) proteins H/PF/2013 strain ZIKV . ZIKVwt SUBJECTS : Healthy adult 18 50 year age . STUDY PLAN : Forty-five subject enrol NIH Clinical Center randomize 3 group receive study product Day 0 , Week 4 Week 8 . The protocol require 18 schedule clinic visit telephone follow-up contact study product administration . Solicited reactogenicity evaluate use 7-day diary card . Assessment vaccine safety include clinical observation monitor hematological chemical parameter clinical visit throughout study . VRC 320 STUDY SCHEMA : - Group 1 : - Administration Method = Single Dose Needle Syringe ; - Subjects = 15 ; - Administration Schedule = Day 0 ( ZIKVwt DNA ( 1 ( 1 mL ) injection ) ) , Week 4 ( ZIKVwt DNA ( 1 ( 1 mL ) injection ) ) , Week 8 ( ZIKVwt DNA ( 1 ( 1 mL ) injection ) ) - Group 2 : - Administration Method = Split Dose Needle Syringe ; - Subjects = 15 ; - Administration Schedule = Day 0 ( ZIKVwt DNA ( 2 ( 0.5 mL ) injection ) ) , Week 4 ( ZIKVwt DNA ( 2 ( 0.5 mL ) injection ) ) , Week 8 ( ZIKVwt DNA ( 2 ( 0.5 mL ) injection ) ) - Group 3 : - Administration Method = Split Dose PharmaJet ; - Subjects = 15 ; - Administration Schedule = Day 0 ( ZIKVwt DNA ( 2 ( 0.5 mL ) injection ) ) , Week 4 ( ZIKVwt DNA ( 2 ( 0.5 mL ) injection ) ) , Week 8 ( ZIKVwt DNA ( 2 ( 0.5 mL ) injection ) ) - Subjects Total = 45 ( All injection total dose 4 mg. ** Up 50 total enrollment permit additional subject need assess safety immunogenicity . ) STUDY DURATION : Subjects evaluate safety immune response throughout study 44 week follow first vaccine administration . Durability immune response evaluate two long term follow-up visit , occur 18 24 month</detailed_description>
