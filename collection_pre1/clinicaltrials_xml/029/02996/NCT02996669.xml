	<detailed_description>The specify aim study accelerate development effective treatment social impairment ASD validate outcome measure sensitive reliable assessment response treatment electroencephalography ( EEG ) eye-tracking ( ET ) biomarkers . These hypothesize outcome could use reduce heterogeneity sample via stratification , could possibly indicate early efficacy , and/or demonstrate target engagement . The consortium conduct naturalistic , longitudinal study preschool school-aged ( 6-11 year ) child ASD typical development ( TD ) intelligence quotient ( ) ( IQ ) range 50-150 . Children assess across three time point ( Baseline , 6 week 24 week ) use clinician , caregiver lab-based ( LB ) measure social impairment , along battery conceptually related EEG ET task independent rating clinical status .</detailed_description>
