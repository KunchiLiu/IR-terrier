	<brief_summary>The study 's main purpose evaluate safety performance LeadExx LC System ability safely extract lead . The study enroll 10 patient schedule CIED lead extraction . The decision upon lead extraction base upon applicable Heart Rhythm Society guideline European Heart Rhythm Association ( EHRA ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Performance LeadExx LC System Lead Extraction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The use implantable cardiac device exponentially increase , lead extraction become necessary procedure . But lead extraction potentially serious complication , include venous myocardial tear , cardiac tamponade , even death . Powered sheath , Excimer laser radiofrequency system , use extraction ICD pacemaker lead . However , Heart Rhythm Society ( HRS ) state `` possible predictor major complication implant duration old lead , female gender , ICD lead removal , use laser extraction technique , multiple lead , calcify lead '' . To reduce risk lead extraction procedure therefore reduce number abandon lead , LeadExx develop system . The LC system active disposable system provide sterile single use . The system comprise follow two main part : a. Dilation Unit ( DU ) - ( invasive , sterile ) b . Control Unit- ( CU ) - ( non-invasive , sterile fluid path ) The physical connection unit achieve 3 Luer lock connect CU Solenoids ' output 3 flexible tube proximal end DU . 1 . Dilation Unit ( DU ) : The dilation unit invasive sterile unit , comprise dilation tip connect shaft . The unit activate use hydraulic mechanism . The dilation tip thread lead , inserted vessel together connect shaft advance along lead , dilate surround tissue ultimately enable lead removal vein . 2 . Control Unit ( CU ) : The Control Unit non-invasive fluid path sterile unit , comprise various shelf module . The unit fill sterile Saline prior operation synchronize transfer Saline DU control advancement . I</detailed_description>
