Towards goal , investigator propose randomized clinical trial behavioral sleep treatment design specifically child DS , document impact sleep , also child 's daytime inhibitory control behavior problem , caregiver 's sleep stress level . The investigator randomize 80 family child DS age 6-17 receive either 5-session behavioral sleep treatment ( BST ; target sleep education , behavioral principle visual support ) general-education control condition ( CON ) . The BST cater unique need child DS , adapt intervention successfully treat behavioral sleep disturbance child autism1 .

	<detailed_description>The investigator long-term goal improve outcome child DS caregiver . Towards goal , investigator propose randomized clinical trial behavioral sleep treatment design specifically child DS , document impact sleep , also child 's daytime inhibitory control behavior problem , caregiver 's sleep stress level . The investigator randomize 80 family child DS age 6-17 receive either 5-session behavioral sleep treatment ( BST ; target sleep education , behavioral principle visual support ) general-education control condition ( CON ) . The BST cater unique need child DS , adapt intervention develop member investigator research team NIH support ( R34 MH082882 ) successfully treat behavioral sleep disturbance child autism41 . Pre- post-intervention , child undergo comprehensive assessment cognitive , behavioral , adaptive functioning involve direct test input parent teacher . Child parent sleep monitor via actigraphy parent-completed sleep diary , parent report stress level mood . As critical first step towards effective treatment , initial efficacy study address 3 aim : Aim # 1 : Test efficacy manualized BST improve sleep child DS . Hypothesis 1 : Sleep duration quality improve BST condition CON condition . Aim # 2 : Test impact BST daytime function child DS . Hypothesis 2 : Children receive BST make great gain inhibitory control , general behavior problem measure executive dysfunction CON condition . Aim # 3 : Test whether BST , focus child 's sleep , also impact caregiver ' sleep stress . Hypothesis 3 : Parents child receive BST improved sleep duration decrease stress .</detailed_description>
