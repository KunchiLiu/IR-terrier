	<brief_summary>The goal study determine whether clinical decision support ( CDS ) radiology affect number , type , appropriateness target high-cost radiology image order ( i.e . magnetic resonance ( MR ) , compute tomography ( CT ) , nuclear medicine ( NM ) Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) scan ) . The CDS deliver physician Aurora Health Care system . It deliver Epic , industry-standard electronic medical record software , ACR Select , lead decision support tool base American College Radiology ( ACR ) Appropriateness Criteria ( see http : //www.acr.org/Quality-Safety/Appropriateness-Criteria ) . The ACR Select tool rate image order scale 1-9 1-3 label 'usually appropriate ' , 4-6 'May appropriate ' , 7-9 'usually appropriate ' .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>With healthcare spending accounting almost one-fifth U.S. economy even large share public sector budget , substantial interest innovation healthcare delivery reduce `` use '' resource low value patient . As result , key need rigorous evidence scalable intervention aim improving efficiency U.S. healthcare sector general , public sector particular , account $ 1.25 trillion annual healthcare spending . In particular , widespread concern medical profession public sector cost health risk `` over-scanning '' . Estimates suggest many 30 % image U.S. unnecessary . Medicare direct spending `` high-cost '' scan ( e.g . MRs CTs ) $ 10 billion 2012 , 2 % total Medicare cost ; indirect cost likely considerably great , since image often trigger additional follow care . It also estimate 2 percent cancer U.S. due CT use . Reflecting concern , start 2018 Medicare longer reimburse high-cost scan unless order use `` acceptable '' Clinical Decision Support ( CDS ) system . Despite upcoming policy change , investigator know large-scale randomized trial impact CDS imaging . The intervention study provide Clinical Decision Support ( CDS ) target high-cost radiology order , ( MR , CT , NM , PET scan ) , healthcare provider treat patient setting affiliate Aurora Health Care system headquarter Wisconsin . CDS tool embed order entry system provide information guidance provider whether intend order `` appropriate '' whether highly recommended alternative . The randomization provider level : half receive CDS , remain half provider study serve control group . The CDS deliver order-entry software , Epic , ACR Select software , lead decision support tool base American College Radiology ( ACR ) Appropriateness Criteria . Recommendations appear CDS tool digitize version guideline create American College Radiology ( ACR ) . The guideline score appropriateness scan order give health indication , indication include common symptom diagnosis keywords , `` acute headache . '' In particular , indication-scan pair assign `` appropriateness rating '' 1-9 . Scores 1-3 'usually appropriate , ' 4-6 'may appropriate , ' 7-9 'usually appropriate . ' To learn CDS impact order behavior , investigator investigate whether exposed CDS order way avoids CDS , place via clerical worker choose different indication . The investigator plan analyze outcome across different setting ( Inpatient v Outpatient ED ) . Last , investigator find effect CDS order examine effect utilization , include length inpatient stay . The primary outcome number image order would produce best-practice alert suggest change . The investigator conduct power calculation use 7-month intervention window 6 month pre-period data calculate lag dependent variable control . With control , minimum detectible effect 13 % reduction compare mean 11 scan time period . In addition , investigator investigate number scan ( high-cost , high-cost score 1-3 , high-cost score 4-6 , substitution low-cost scan . The investigator also investigate whether treatment group order way avoids CDS , place via clerical worker choose different indication . The investigator plan analyze outcome across different setting ( Inpatient v Outpatient ED ) . Last , investigator find effect CDS order examine effect utilization , include length inpatient stay .</detailed_description>
