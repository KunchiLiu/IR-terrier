Approximately half fracture classify relationship hip joint capsule intracapsular . These fracture subdivide displaced undisplaced . The majority displace fracture treat replacement arthroplasty . Current treatment undisplaced fracture generally internal fixation fracture use screw plate , although centre prefer replacement arthroplasty . A recent randomised study patient Norway undisplaced intracapsular fracture treat either internal fixation arthroplasty report reduced complication re-operations patient treat arthroplasty . In addition functional result marginally good patient treat arthroplasty . Current practice UK generally treat fracture internal fixation . This study aim see replacement arthroplasty indeed lead advantage suggest Norwegian study . Patients satisfy inclusion criterion willing participate randomise receive either reduction internal fixation fracture screw plate device alternatively replacement femoral head artificial hip replacement ( hemiarthroplasty ) . After surgery patient receive treatment normal discharge home able , follow-up review hip fracture clinic . Subsequent follow-up research project phone call research nurse blind type treatment patient receive .
