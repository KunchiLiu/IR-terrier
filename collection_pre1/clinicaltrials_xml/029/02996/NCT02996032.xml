	<brief_title>CRUSH STUDY : Calculating Readmission Risk Ultrasound Heart Failure Failure Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heart failure ( HF ) result congestion lead cause admission person â‰¥65 year age 20-25 % patient readmitted within 30 day discharge . Efforts treat HF difficult without simple method detect early sign congestion direct therapy . Ultrasound detect evidence congestion increase cardiac filling pressure two week prior marker congestion weight gain patient symptom . Corrected flow time ( FTc ) measure ultrasound , easy perform vascular measure correlate cardiac filling pressure . Despite relationship FTc filling pressure , measure never study HF . The primary aim determine FTc predict patient risk readmission within 30 day . As secondary aim , investigator plan validate small study patient report ability pulmonary ultrasound predict readmission . This study demonstrate pulmonary ultrasound 100 % sensitive 68 % specific predict readmission 3 month , however investigation small validation need . It expect ultrasound able accurately safely predict patient readmitted within 30 day discharge . This proposal aim identify noninvasive measure well ass congestion HF predict readmission .</detailed_description>
