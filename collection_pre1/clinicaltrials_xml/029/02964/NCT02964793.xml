	<brief_summary>Fetal Growth Restriction ( FGR ) remain challenge topic clinician , researcher policy maker , central question improve performance screen pregnancy order provide appropriate care . The recent recommendation report French result raise awareness need improve growth screen France . Based exist literature , hypothesis great investment growth monitor base rigorous interpretation information available routinely implemented clinical assessment ultrasound allow significant gain detection . The current context provide opportunity evaluate application train program serial plot Symphysis Fundal Height ( SFH ) Estimated Fetal Weight ( EFW ) customise chart . This intervention consistent French guideline support monthly measurement SFH , use Customised Fetal Weight Reference ( CFWR ) , particular referral US ( Ultrasound ) examination , longitudinal interpretation growth . These guideline recently restate clinical practice recommendation issue French College Obstetricians Gynecologists . The intervention test trial include training professional standardization SFH measurement , introduction software , recommendation growth interpretation referral examination . Expected benefit increase antenatal identification growth restrict fetus without increase FP rate . Such program allow identify Small Gestational Age ( SGA ) fetuses receive appropriate antenatal care . This intervention could double detection rate SGA birth 20 40 % , correspond 32 000 infant nationwide annually antenatal care could improve . Main objective : To test effectiveness serial plot SFH EFW measure customise percentile chart support provider training , versus standard antenatal care , improve detection FGR . The aim investigator double rate antenatal detection 20 40 % among SGA infant , define birthweight 10th percentile GA .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Type study Randomized cluster trial Study objectives : Main objective : To test effectiveness serial plot SFH EFW measure customise percentile chart support provider training , versus standard antenatal care , improve detection FGR . Our aim double rate antenatal detection 20 40 % among SGA infant , define birthweight 10th percentile GA . Secondary objective : To measure impact screen program : 1 . Perinatal outcome : stillbirth neonatal morbidity mortality include risk severe growth restriction ( le 3rd percentile ) . 2 . Rate false positive likelihood ratio screen policy 3 . Modes onset labor delivery 4 . Resource use cost : number antenatal visit referral ultrasound examination indication evaluate Primary endpoint Detection FGR pregnancy , define : - The mention suspect growth restriction medical chart - And either least one referral additional US growth monitor - And/Or provider indicate delivery FGR among SGA birth , define infant birthweight 10th centile French CFWR . Secondary endpoint 1 . Perinatal outcome : late fetal death , Apgar score &lt; 7 5 min , pH &lt; 7 , resuscitation , severe growth restriction ( le 3rd percentile ) , admission neonatal unit , neonatal convulsion , intra-ventricular hemorrhage , hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy , death hospital stay 2 . Rate false positive ( equal 1-specificity ) , likelihood ratio screen policy 95 % confidence interval . The rate FP define suspect FGR among non-SGA birth accord CFWR . 3 . Modes onset labor delivery : labor induction indication , caesarean section indication ( include pre-labor caesarean caesarean section onset labor ) , provider indicate delivery 37 39 week GA 4 . Resource use cost : number antenatal visit , number referral ultrasound examination mean number US per woman , number umbilical artery Doppler examination Inclusion criterion : Singleton pregnancy , Booking 30 week GA maternity unit , Delivery participate unit Exclusion criterion : Terminations pregnancy , Known fibroid uterus uterine congenital malformation , Refusal participate , Minor patient HPAG cluster randomize trial involve 16 geographically dispersed French maternity unit . In maternity unit randomize intervention group , protocol growth monitoring support prior training healthcare professional implement pregnant woman receive antenatal care unit , whatever GA medical obstetrical risk . The intervention consist standardization current practice . Clinicians intervention maternity unit follow standardize protocol , ask measure SFH antenatal appointment , collect EFW 3rd trimester US , report value chart , monitor fetal growth accord protocol guideline . Practices remain unchanged control group . After delivery , inclusion exclusion criterion assess independent clinical research investigator , probably midwife . All SGA birth non-SGA birth accord French CFWR include answer main secondary objective . Data collection carry referent midwife . Recorded information include antenatal care provide , suspicion FGR , labor delivery mode , neonatal outcome discharge home . The use intervention also assess intervention maternity unit record information presence completeness customise chart medical record . Sites : 16 French maternity unit Duration : 24 month , include 6 month inclusion Number participant : 10 000 birth ( 625 per maternity unit )</detailed_description>
