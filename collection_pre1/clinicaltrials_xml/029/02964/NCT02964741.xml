	<brief_summary>This study investigate whether non-invasive brain stimulation , give 20 minutes/once per day ten day ( M-F ) reduce migraine pain . Thirty patient receive treatment , thirty receive `` sham '' procedure . Up thirty healthy volunteer ask undergo baseline assessment ( image , brain stimulation ) . Healthy volunteer data may use prior study ( NINDS-K23062946 project [ IRBMED # HUM00027383 ; Dr. Alexandre DaSilva , Principal Investigator ] ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Migraine debilitate chronic condition affect patient 's existence , childhood late adulthood . During frequent headache attack , sufferer show mark increased sensitivity noxious ( hyperalgesia ) even non-noxious stimulus , phenomenon call cutaneous allodynia affect 63 % patient . Although MRI-based technique provide insight brain mechanism migraine , many question regard molecular impact brain still unanswered . The overall goal project provide detailed understanding µ-opioid receptor mediate transmission brain migraine patient , one important central pain regulatory system human , long-term objective develop focused neuromechanism-driven method migraine research therapy . Preliminary study earlier project ( NINDS-NIHK23 NS0629946 ) use positron emission tomography ( PET ) [ 11C ] carfentanil , selective radiotracer μ-opioid receptor ( μOR ) , indicate decrease µOR availability ( non-displaceable binding potential ; BPND ) brain migraine patient headache attack allodynia , include area like thalamus periaqueductal gray matter ( PAG ) . µOR BPND objective measurement , vivo , endogenous μ-opioid availability , acute reduction reflect activation neurotransmitter system . This arguably one neuromechanisms centrally involved pain regulation , affect multiple element pain experience . Moreover , MRI-based report find finding co-localize neuroplastic change migraine patient . Conventional therapy unable selectively target dysfunctional brain region , paucity data reverse embed neuroplastic molecular mechanism available medication surgical therapy fail . Several study motor cortex stimulation ( MCS ) show epidural electrode primary motor cortex ( M1 ) effective provide analgesia patient refractory central . The rationale MCS stimulation base part thalamic dysfunction notice chronic pain migraine , also study demonstrate MCS significantly change thalamic activity . Evidently , invasive nature procedure limit indication highly severe chronic pain disorder . New non-invasive brain neuromodulatory method M1 , transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) , safely modulate activate µOR system , provide relatively last pain relief chronic pain patient migraine . However , electric field generate conventional analgesic montage widely spread across brain , lack specificity pain-related structure directly target . Recently , novel high-definition tDCS ( HD-tDCS ) montage create group able reduce exclusively `` contralateral '' sensory-discrimative clinical pain measure ( pain intensity/area ) chronic patient target precisely putative M1 region . It hop montage provide durable relief pain episodic migraine population . This phase 2 , single center , two-arm , double-masked , randomized investigation modulation µ-opioid mechanism migraine ( vivo ) . We enroll 60 patient episodic migraine ( 30 active M1 HD-tDCS group 30 sham group ) . Each participant undergo sequence event evaluation include baseline assessment , 10 day HD-tDCS , pre- post-PET MRI scan , questionnaire evaluate pain quality life .</detailed_description>
