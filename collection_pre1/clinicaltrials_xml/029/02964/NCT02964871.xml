	<detailed_description>Project Overview : The primary goal RAPID-LTCF conduct randomize , control clinical trial ( RCT ) ass effect on-site , rapid influenza detection long-term care facility ( LTCFs ) influenza-related hospitalization , death , healthcare-associated cost . The basic research question PICO format : Population : resident LTCFs across Wisconsin Intervention : early detection influenza couple infection control guidance Comparator : compare usual care Outcomes : result : 1. increase early detection report influenza outbreak ? 2. increase early antiviral treatment influenza ? 3. increase use antiviral prophylaxis at-risk resident ? 4. few hospitalization influenza season ? 5. reduced mortality influenza season ? 6. low healthcare associate cost influenza season ? Building two highly successful pilot QI projects—undertaken last two influenza seasons—that confirm feasibility desirability approach , exist , CLIA-waived , low-complexity rapid influenza diagnostic test ( RIDT ) high sensitivity high specificity population diagnostic platform use . RIDT analyzer configure wireless transmission anonymous test result cloud-based server real-time access public health . Detection influenza LTCF transmission public health real time trigger communication advice appropriate infection control measure reduce in-facility transmission . This approach high potential limit influenza 's effect LTCFs . Residents LTCFs high risk influenza infection due reduce efficacy influenza vaccine elder , close quarter , presence co-morbid medical condition , delay response time . Consequently , outbreak influenza significant respiratory virus easily spread within LTCFs cause substantial morbidity mortality population . Results RCT provide highly generalizable approach use low-cost , low-complexity easily-adapted tool protocols extremely early influenza detection response . It anticipate early outbreak recognition control LTCFs substantially reduce morbidity , mortality healthcare associate cost vulnerable population . Background : At present , 1.8 million individual live nation 's 16,000 nursing home additional 900,000 live assist living facility . Significant healthcare disparity exist individual ; recent study find large for-profit nursing home deliver significantly low quality care . Part disparity reflect fate infect influenza . Influenza pneumonia combine form 8th leading cause death United States . Outbreaks influenza respiratory virus common LTCFs result significant morbidity mortality among resident . This increased morbidity mortality due combination close quartering , resident co-morbid medical condition , delay medical response . Because high risk , influenza vaccination long recommend resident health care worker setting . Influenza vaccine , however , low efficacy old individual ; vaccine efficacy protection predominant influenza strain 2014-2015 estimate 14 % individual age 50 year old . Accordingly , elder ( age 65+ ) account 72.4 % Wisconsin 's influenza-related hospitalization 2014-2015 influenza season 63 % influenza-related ICU admission . Moreover , across country , rate attributable influenza hospitalization 313 per 100,000 individual age 65 year older . The current practice identify respond influenza outbreak LTCFs reactive delayed . Of 41 known influenza outbreak LTCFs 2010-2011 season New York , identify retrospectively report influenza hospitalization well LTCFs submit report Department Health . The availability CLIA-waived , low-complexity , sensitive specific rapid influenza detection test ( RIDTs ) facilitate on-site diagnosis early detection outbreak . Coupling RIDTs wireless transmission anonymous result directly public health official provide mean extremely early proactive outbreak recognition intervention . Program Goal : A randomized , control clinical trial assess effect on-site RIDTs LTCFs subsequent influenza-related hospitalization , death , healthcare-associated cost propose . LTCF nursing staff use RIDT technology screen resident acute respiratory infection ( ARI ) . The propose RIDT CLIA-waved , low-complexity test use benign nasal swab specimen . It configure send test result via wireless transmission cloud platform . From , data access real-time public health partner . Methods : Starting January 2013 , extensive experience Quidel SOFIA Influenza A+B system 20 clinical site 7 LCTFs test platform transmits influenza test result immediately cloud-based system public health access acquire . True `` real-time '' availability surveillance result achievable . Since initiation , highly innovative system work flawlessly . A plan conduct RAPID-LTCF three sequential influenza season adapt uncertainty influenza epidemiology propose . Twenty LTCFs across Wisconsin recruit participation randomize , follow stratification , intervention ( RIDT ) control ( usual care ) arm . Waived consent on-site specimen collection resident RIDT sit acute respiratory infection approve IRB . Nasal swabs test nursing personnel intervention site use SOFIA . Anonymous result send , via wireless transmission , daily review study team public health personnel . A positive influenza detection trigger direct communication LTCF personnel advice antiviral treatment , antiviral prophylaxis , appropriate infection control practice . Data collect site regard number course influenza antiviral medication provide influenza treatment influenza prophylaxis , number hospitalization , number death , associate healthcare cost annual , dynamic , 4-month risk window , base Wisconsin surveillance influenza pattern . An independent data monitoring safety board continuously review outcome halt study significant difference two arm emerge . Outcomes assess use standard statistical method . Significance : This program reflect full intent Wisconsin Partnership Program Wisconsin Idea identify high-risk population , combine research , education public health practice reduce disparity care experienced population . The application cutting-edge , inexpensive , high-performing reliable technology population traditionally under-served , high-risk individual would provide translatable model early proactive detection , response influenza LTCFs , thus allow appropriate medical ( antiviral ) public health ( in-room quarantining , enhance personal protection equipment , prophylaxis resident ) intervention .</detailed_description>
