	<brief_summary>Women recently release ( RR woman ) incarceration constitute vulnerable group characterize high rate untreated HIV sexually transmit infection ( STIs ) , substance use disorder ( SUD ) , mental health ( MH ) disorder trauma . This interconnected syndemic require help RR woman overcome multiple internal structural care barrier . This R34 build work conduct PI NIDA-funded K23 project , intervention call Women 's Initiative Supporting Health ( WISH ) develop improve RR woman 's engagement HIV , Hepatitis C ( HCV ) , primary medical care use Self Determination Theory ( SDT ) . The propose R34 project , natural extension prior work , conduct pilot randomize control trial ( RCT ) WISH intervention examine feasibility , acceptability , preliminary effectiveness .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The PI identify two priority need RR woman : ( 1 ) adequate HIV/HCV prevention counseling service , include HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) medication woman high risk , ( 2 ) primary care avenue address co-occurring SUD , MH disorder , trauma interfere HIV preventive care . WISH gender , trauma , culturally-specific , peer-delivered intervention design improve health service utilization health behavior . The propose pilot RCT examine feasibility , acceptability preliminary effectiveness WISH intervention community set . The WISH intervention ground Self-Determination Theory ( SDT ) , show support autonomy increase autonomous regulation perceive competence mediate engagement healthy behavior overcome internal structural barrier . A novel exploratory aim propose study examine whether related biologic change vary association SDT mediation measure . Serum inflammatory biomarkers interleukin ( IL ) -6 , IL-8 , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) coagulation marker D-dimer variation associate HIV vulnerability depression , biomarkers study relation SDT . This study randomize RR woman WISH intervention enhance treatment-as-usual ( eTAU ) control . WISH peer community health worker ( CHW ) conduct SDT-based individual session woman address autonomy competence regard linkage HIV risk reduction treatment , SUD treatment , primary care , structural empowerment . Structurally , peer part primary care medical team : ( 1 ) inform provider regard woman 's treatment need readiness ; ( 2 ) navigate RR woman link HIV risk reduction service include prophylaxis provider ; ( 3 ) help woman overcome systemic barrier care . The investigator examine SDT mediation measure , associate internal structural barrier , treatment engagement adherence , HIV risk behavior , inflammation . Specific aim follow : Aim 1 : Evaluate feasibility acceptability WISH intervention community setting : Aim 1 Outcomes : Participant mix method feedback study intervention procedure . Aim 2 : Assess preliminary effectiveness WISH improve engagement adherence need treatment associate outcomes 1 . Linkage HIV prevention service ; HIV risk behavior : Assess WISH intervention effect HIV prevention service engagement primary outcome , adherence , reduction HIV risk behavior 2a . Hypothesis : WISH intervention show preliminary effectiveness improve use preventative service , include pre-exposure prophylaxis , self-reported HIV risk behavior , STIs 2 . SUD tx : Examine engagement adherence treatment secondary WISH outcome . Hypothesis : WISH intervention show preliminary effectiveness increase SUD , primary care , MH treatment initiation , engagement , continuity care , reduce substance use &amp; MH symptom . Aim 3 : Assess WISH mechanism action : Assess preliminary effect difference know SDT mediator relation Aim 2 outcome . Hypothesis : SDT measure mediate relationship intervention Aim 2 outcome . Exploratory Aim : Explore inflammatory biomarker outcomes WISH : Measure serum IL-6 , IL-8 , CRP , D-dimer associate SDT mediator intervention control subject . Hypotheses : IL-6 , IL-8 , CRP , D-dimer level associate SDT mediator correlate . Implications : RR woman high risk syndemic risk factor HIV/HCV , SUD , mental health disorder , trauma . Yet , engagement need care group exceedingly low innovative intervention need address problem . To investigator 's knowledge , first study assess SDT-based intervention design address urgently need improvement provision utilization HIV primary care service RR person . The intervention incorporate health behavior change , CHW training , peer-navigation , target biological behavioral mechanism change HIV risk . It develop community training infrastructure lead reduced disparity HIV acquisition</detailed_description>
