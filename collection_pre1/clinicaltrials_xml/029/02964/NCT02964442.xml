	<brief_title>Brown Adipose Tissue Activation Energy Expenditure Capsinoids Stimulation With Trimodality Imaging Using 18-FDG-PET , Fat Fraction MRI Infrared Thermography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It know human adult posse viable brown fat quantity may critical maintenance normal basal metabolic rate ( BMR ) body weight , dispel myth BAT present infancy thermoregulation . There data suggest obesity associate insufficient BAT . So far know arguably 'gold standard ' methodology BAT imaging human 18-FDG-PET . Yet 18-FDG-PET imaging significant limitation , give restrict spatial resolution non-trivial level ionize radiation ( 2.8 mSv ) . The International Commission Radiological Protection recommend radiation exposure general public exceed 1mSv/year 1.5 mSv/year background radiation . In addition , 18-FDG-PET depends glucose uptake BAT directly measure key metabolic activity , namely fatty acid oxidation . Finally , PET scan costly . This make present gold standard far ideal research tool investigate BAT physiology . Thus first objective project develop alternative activate BAT image method base ionize radiation . We interested advance infrared ( IR ) thermography method assess BAT activity develop novel image processing algorithms IR thermography . Much extant literature describe use `` average temperature '' instead IR heat flux use physical principle radiative heat transfer thermodynamics quantify heat BAT . Also , IR digital still-shots mostly employ past whereas none report analysis IR flux use video sequence accurately integrate time-varying heat energy output . Without precision capture process rich IR data , value IR thermography tool BAT research limit . It thus crucial convert IR image readout reflect energy output . We thus develop , validate apply automatic IR image processing computer software efficiently calculate BAT activation . In proposal also improve validate anatomical fat fraction MRI tool evaluate BAT volume base high water content BAT compare WAT . Fat fraction image MRI propose proper validation do due difficulty match PET MRI data BAT . Instead use pharmacologic agent ( e.g . beta 3-adrenergic receptor agonist mirabegron ) administer activate BAT instead cold stimulus , employ capsiate ( i.e . capsinoids - non-spicy analogue capsaicin pepper chilies ) prove effectively stimulate BAT thermoneutral condition confirm PET scan . We conduct preliminary study approve DSRB show effectiveness capsinoids stimulate BAT . There publication document use MRI distinguish BAT WAT , advantage disadvantage . In present study , perform proof-of-concept study simultaneous acquisition MRI 18-FDG-PET dual-modality fusion MRI-PET scanner available Clinical Imaging Research Centre ( CIRC ) image BAT human , correlate IR thermography cervical supraclavicular region ( SCR ) metabolic rate accurately measure whole body calorimeter . Whole body calorimetry real gold standard ass BAT activity measure nonshivering thermogenesis . IR far validate 18-FDG-PET mouse rodent , equivalent validation human publish . If IR thermography show equivalent superior 18-FDG-PET imaging , set new gold standard BAT image boon study BAT biology human .</detailed_description>
