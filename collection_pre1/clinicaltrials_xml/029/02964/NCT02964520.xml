	<brief_title>EEG Alpha/Theta Neurofeedback Reduce Trait Anxiety</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Since late 1960s neurofeedback treatment ( NFT ) use treat adult individual anxiety disorder . Yet relate , evidence-based research study conduct mid-1970s late 1990s . Therefore , NFT efficacious treatment anxiety problem remain unclear . The literature research disclose study , use sample size 10 subject less per experimental control group result mix : Orne &amp; Paskewitz ( 1974 ) Watson &amp; Herder ( 1980 ) find significant effect size anxiety symptom reduction Egner , Strawson &amp; Gruzelier ( 2002 ) find significant difference subjective activation level alpha/theta ( A/T ) NFT sham group . On hand , Hardt &amp; Kamiya ( 1978 ) , Plotkin &amp; Rice ( 1981 ) , Sargunaraj , Kumaraiah , Mishra , &amp; Kumar ( 1987 ) , Rice , Blanchard &amp; Purcell ( 1993 ) , Vanathy , Sharma , &amp; Kumar ( 1998 ) , Sarkar , Rathee , &amp; Neera ( 1999 ) , Eismont Lutsyuk , &amp; Pavlenko ( 2011 ) , Gruzelier , Thompson , Redding , Brandt &amp; Steffert ( 2013 ) find significant anxiety symptom reduction NFT . The U.S. National Institutes Health 's National Center Complementary Integrative Health ( NCCIH ) time endorse NFT efficacious treatment anxiety problem . General hypothesis : A ten-session NFT protocol up-training alpha ( 8-11 Hz ) theta ( 5-7.5 Hz ) frequency band lower subjective experience trait anxiety elevate mean theta lower alpha amplitude EEG recording individual moderate high trait anxiety ( individual ' subjective experience trait anxiety theta/alpha ratio sham NFT condition change ) . Control treatment expectation self-efficacy 1 . There significant difference treatment sham group treatment expectation / self efficacy measure Stanford Expectations Treatment Scale ( SETS ) Rotter Locus Control Scale . 2 . There significant difference treatment sham treatment group pre-and post treatment satisfaction measure assessment measure SETS modify outcome scale . Treatment effect hypothesis : The treatment group average : 3. show high mean theta high alpha amplitude within session sham group . ( The mean theta/alpha ratio within session calculate add theta/alpha ratio begin end first 8-minute NFT block end second third NFT block divide four ratio four ) . 4. high mean linear increase theta amplitude high linear decrease Alpha NFT session individual sham group ( → learn curve ) . 5. feel subjectively deactivate calm ( assessed Thayer 's ActivationDeactivation Adjective Checklist ( AD-ACL ) ) end session sham group . 6. feel subjectively deactivate calm session NFT sham group . 7. show decrease self-rated anxiety symptom ( measure State Trait Anxiety Inventory ( STAI ) , Beck Anxiety Inventory ( BAI ) Generalized Anxiety Item Scale ( GAD-7 ) sham group . 8. show high mean linear increase theta amplitude low mean alpha amplitude within across session correlate high score deactivation relaxation treatment group sham group . 9. show high mean linear increase theta amplitude low mean alpha amplitude across session correlate low pre-post treatment score STAI , BAI , GAD-7 inventory treatment group sham group , meaning= &gt; high negative correlation STAI , BAI , GAD-7 change score mean linear increase theta amplitude low mean alpha amplitude across session expect treatment group change group . 10. high alpha theta distribution mini-QEEG , particularly Pz region . Adults prior NFT experience score moderate high State Anxiety Inventory Questionnaires ( STAI-Y ; score : &gt; 66 % ) , low Beck Depression Questionnaire ( BDI-II ; score : &lt; 19 ) , may may diagnose anxiety disorder , serious co-morbid mental health neurological condition , Major Depressive Disorder , Bipolar Disorder , Schizophrenia , Substance Use Disorder , epilepsy tic disorder include study . After pre-screening , participant assign experimental sham NFT condition randomize MATLAB protocol ( seven random zero/one vector four integer length , equally make zeros one , represent experimental ( digit 1 ) control group participant ( digit 0 ) ) . Experimental sham group reward uptraining power particular wave frequency use auditory , visual , number reward . The two reward sound ( low pan flute sound steel drum sound ) playing sustain MIDI sound amplitude modulation depend power respective wave frequency . The reward criterion set 250ms refractory period 200 m reward . Participants also show fly dragon loop video ( Vulcan fly ) become bright color alpha and/or theta power visual reward see reward percentage number screen beside loop video . Both group train three segment eight minute NFT 90 break ( depend participant ' preference ) segment . The experimental A/T NFT group receive ten session A/T NFT — specifically up-training alpha ( 8-11 Hz , low pan flute sound ) theta ( 5-7 Hz , steel drum sound ) . The sham NFT group receive ten session two alternate NFT protocol . In odd-numbered session ( 1,3,5,7,9 ) lobeta ( 13-16 Hz pan flute sound ) hibeta ( 16-22 Hz , steel drum sound ) uptrained alpha ( 8-11 Hz ) , theta ( 5-7.5 Hz ) hibeta ( 23-30 Hz ) inhibit . In even numbered session ( 2,4,6,8,10 ) beta ( 13-16 Hz , pan flute sound ) hibeta ( 16-22 Hz , steel drum ) down-trained alpha ( 8-11 Hz ) , theta ( 5-7.5 Hz ) hibeta ( 23-30 Hz ) inhibit . The BrainAvatar® 4.0 suite ( Brainmaster Technologies , Inc ; http : //www.brainmaster.com ) , use NFT . Pz select EEG record site , A1 reference A2 ground electrode . The sample rate set standard 256 Hz per second resolution &lt; 0.01 Hz , 10,000 amplification . Impedance set &lt; 10 kOhms . Filters use band pas filter ( 80Hz high 60 low pas ) A/D low pas filter ( allow 0-30 Hz activity ) . Smoothing time 0.5s 3 dB . The artifact rejection threshold set 200 microV . Statistical analysis : The overall design propose study call mixed ANOVA Treatment condition ( A/T vs. sham ) serve between-subjects , pre/post level anxiety , within-subjects factor . Treatment effectiveness ( across group ) would reflect significant within-subjects effect efficacy NFT specifically would reflect interaction whereby significantly improvement ( i.e . lower trait anxiety ) would find A/T contrast Sham-Control condition . In mixed analysis kind , total ( N = 27 ) participant require detect moderate size ( f = .25 ) interaction effect within-subjects effect adequate power ( .80 ) . Specifically : ANOVAs - pre-and post-treatment ( &amp; 10 session neurofeedback ) mean theta/alpha ratio sham treatment group - pre-and post-session ( 10 session ) mean theta/alpha ratio within individual &amp; session compare sham &amp; treatment group - pre-and post-session ( 10 session ) Activation Deactivation Adjective Checklist ( AD-ACL ) score within individual - pre-and post-session ( 10 session ) AD-ACL score session - pre- post treatment STAI anxiety score treatment sham group - pre- post treatment BAI anxiety score treatment sham group - pre- post treatment GAD-7 anxiety score treatment sham group - pre-and post treatment mini-QEEG pattern treatment sham group Correlations / regression analysis : - individual learning curve A/T treatment condition ten session : mean theta/alpha ratio individual session - correlation AD-ACL pre- post treatment score theta/alpha ratio pre-and post treatment - correlation SETS score pre- post treatment score theta/alpha ratio pre-and post treatment - correlation STAI pre-and post treatment score theta/alpha ratio pre-and post treatment - correlation BAI pre-and post treatment score theta/alpha pre-and post treatment score - correlation GAD-7 pre-and post treatment score theta/alpha pre-and post treatment score - correlation Rotter Locus Control score theta/alpha ratio pre-and post treatment Qualitative Analysis : - mental strategy use NFT train effective different strategy perceive individual subject - specific change ( ) thought , feeling behavior everyday life individual subject perceive</detailed_description>
