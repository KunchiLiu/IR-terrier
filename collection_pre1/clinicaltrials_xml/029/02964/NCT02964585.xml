	<brief_summary>The investigator hypothesize Cana may able improve number function CD34+ endothelial progenitor cell . The investigator also propose expect cardiovascular benefit independent HbA1C reduction . In proposed study investigator plan recruit patient type 2 diabetes less equal 15 year duration ( early phase diagnosis ) , stable dose metformin least 3 month still remain inadequately control HbA1C 7 % 10 % ( value inclusive ) , overtly control ( &gt; 10 % HbA1C ) . Subjects begin take 100 mg Cana placebo initial 4 week . Subjects withdraw study medication placebo tolerate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Role Canagliflozin CD34+ Cells Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mild CKD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetes affect 11 % adult United States project nearly double 2025 . Both diabetes obesity associate endothelial dysfunction , oxidative stress , endothelial cell inflammation , cardiovascular pro-thrombotic state common cause kidney disease . Use sodium-glucose link transporter ( SGLT-2 ) inhibitor show promise improve glycemic control , weight reduction , hypertension even change circulate Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system ( RAAS ) nitric oxide ( NO ) . However , whether group drug effect cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) risk modification endothelium endothelial progenitor cell surrogate cardiovascular renal risk outcome measure , unclear . The investigator previously show CD34+ cell , derive peripheral blood act cellular biomarker reliable serum base marker CVD risk estimation . Serum base inflammatory marker useful endothelium already damage inflame . Such serum base biomarkers take several month change give preventive predictable information whether particular medication may affect future endothelium . This study endothelium progenitor crucial . In investigator ' previous study prediabetes population aerobic exercise intervention , investigator demonstrate CD34+ cell responsive change therapy intervention within 2-4 week use reliable non serum base cellular bio-marker . CD34+ cell endothelial progenitor cell use clinically improve collateral circulation extensively study robust cardiovascular biomarker . Therefore study CD34+ cell patient , without Canagliflozin ( Cana ) give vital information medication effect endothelium . This particularly important another SGLT2 inhibitor Empagliflozin show unparalleled positive cardiovascular effect oral hypoglycemic agent . Of course , question arise whether clinical trial effect secondary glucose effect direct effect SGLT2 inhibitor endothelium . Multiple glucose transporter identify human cell include GLUTs , SGLTs even taste receptor ( TLR2 TLR3 ) . The investigator know SGLT transporter present tubular cell clearly block SGLT2 cell beneficial . Information glucose transporter stem progenitor cell almost nil . In lab investigator show presence GLUT1 , SGLTs TLR3 CD34+ cell . The investigator also demonstrate hyperglycemia toxic CD34+ cell , CD31+ positive mature endothelial cell . The investigator hypothesize block SGLT2 CD34+ cell beneficial rather detrimental . As far glucose uptake CD34+ cell concerned glucose transporter sufficient , fact lesser amount glucose entry hyperglycemic milieu ( type 2 DM patient ) may less pro-inflammatory less pro-apoptotic . Our preliminary data indicate mRNA gene expression SGLT1 SGLT2 note human CD34+ cell however SGLT2 mRNA gene expression up-regulated several fold human CD34+ cell presence hyperglycemia ( 20mM glucose ) . However non primary commercially obtain human endothelium ( HUVEC ) show similar result . An explanation could SGLT2 expression decrease cell transition progenitor mature endothelium . From result investigator believe SGLT2 inhibitor effective progenitor mature endothelium . The investigator therefore hypothesize CD34+ cell ideal biomarker study effect drug . It possible Cana , block SGLT2 receptor , may influence CD34+ cell surface receptor include glucose transporter influence function ( importantly migration ) . If particular medication positively influence stem/progenitor cell migration medication positively influence endothelial dysfunction vascular complication diabetes . The investigator particularly interested note effect Canagliflozin , SGLT2 inhibitor glucose transporter GLUT 1 4 look SGLT 1 2 CD34+ cell . It helpful discern effect particularly choice oral diabetic medication type 2 diabetes population practically limited metformin , DPP4 inhibitor SGLT2 inhibitor . The investigator plan investigate effect Cana CD34+ cell , placebo match study . The investigator plan recruit subject type 2 diabetes follow characteristic : 1 ) overweight , mild moderately obese ( BMI=25.0-39.9 ) ; 2 ) individual early type 2 diabetes ( ≤15 year ) inadequate control , HbA1C= 7.0 10.0 % , Metformin ( 1-2 grams/day ) 3 ) history presence macrovascular complication CKD high stage 2 . The subject Metformin per ADA , Metformin 1st line care along life-style modification . While Metformin may affect inflammatory biomarkers , effect minimal best , particularly presence CKD endothelial dysfunction . Also placebo cana group Metformin . The investigator recruit total 40 patient ( 20 individuals/per group ) approximately 20 % drop rate two year investigator hope retain 32 individual ( 16/group ) . Individuals group match sex , age , race . Participants assess baseline ( week 0 ) , 2 4 month drug intake .</detailed_description>
