	<brief_summary>Takayasu arteritis ( TA ) chronic large-vessel vasculitis mainly affect aorta major branch . The epidemiology pathophysiology TA still unclear China , although many study do . Our previous study support National Natural Science Foundation China indicate cytokine hs-CRP , NT-proBNP tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-α ) use monitor TA activity , HLA gene allele associate TA Chinese han population . Further investigation large sample need fully understand pathophysiology TA . The purpose study build Chinese national registry system TA obtain real-world information , current status characteristic , diagnosis , disease activity , severity disease , treatment outcome Chinese TA patient . To analysis development effective disease monitoring treatment strategy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Takayasu arteritis ( TA ) chronic vasculitis cause inflammation aorta main branch characterize adventitial thicken cellular infiltration tunica medium , local destruction vascular smooth muscle cell elastin . The disease rare commonly occur China . In last decade , result study indicated HLA-DPB1 , HLA-DQA1 , HLA-DQB1 HLA-DRB1 gene allele associate TA Chinese Han population . And clinical feature patient TA analyze . The cytokine hs-CRP , NT-proBNP tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-α ) use monitor TA activity . But still many unknown field TA , epidemiology pathophysiology . This study build Chinese national registry system TA obtain real-world information , current status characteristic , diagnosis , disease activity , severity disease , treatment outcome Chinese TA patient . To analysis development effective treatment strategy .</detailed_description>
