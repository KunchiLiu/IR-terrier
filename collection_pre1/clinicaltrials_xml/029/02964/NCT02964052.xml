	<brief_summary>Use intravenous ( IV ) thrombolysis intra-arterial ( IA ) recanalization treatment rapidly increase , However , despite treatment , recanalization rate 22.6 - 70 % 30-50 % patient show meaningful clinical improvement . Mechanisms futile recanalization may include 1 ) large ischemic core , 2 ) poor collateral , 3 ) presence comorbidity . In regard , develop selection criterion use acute stroke image comorbidity warrant . Investigators recruit consecutive acute stroke patient receive IV thrombolysis and/or IA recanalization treatment . This study perform prospective design develop CT-based clot , core collateral score comorbidity index select stroke patient high risk treatment . Investigators firstly establish CT-based score comorbidity index use pre-existing cohort database . Using CT-based comorbidity index , Investigators validate multi-center prospectively cohort . In addition , Investigators assess cost-effectiveness selecting patient base comorbidity index .</brief_summary>
