	<brief_summary>Neurofibromatosis Type 1 ( NF1 ) common genetic disorder associate four time great risk learn disability , include read disability , deficiency neurofibromin - protein important signal pathway regulate learn memory . Our previous work ( NS49096 ) demonstrate school-age child NF+RD respond standard phonologically-based reading tutor originally develop treat read disability general population . Combining work researcher suggest medication ( Lovastatin ) may counteract effect deficient neurofibromin , possibly ameliorate learn disability NF1 , investigator propose examine synergistic effect medication plus reading tutoring .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Neurofibromitosis Type 1 ( NF1 ) common autosomal dominant neurocutaneous syndrome . The common concern NF1 learning disability ( LDs ) . Approximately half child NF1 LDs , common reading disability ( RDs ) .The purpose research gain deeper understand characteristic treatment RDs NF1 . The Investigator evaluate three different group ( see list ) determine differential outcome group children.with NF+RD . 1 . Reading tutor program medication call Lovastatin 2 . Reading tutor program Lovastatin ( placebo ) 3 . No reading ( sham ) tutoring Lovastatin</detailed_description>

	<criteria>This study open native English speaker meet eligibility criterion regardless race , gender , minority socioeconomic status . A child exclude he/she meet follow criterion , determine initial telephone screen well review medical/developmental history prior testing : 1. previous diagnosis Intellectual Disability ; 2. know uncorrectable visual impairment ; 3. document hearing impairment great equal 25 dB loss ; 4. medical contraindication MRI procedure ( e.g. , metal device ) ; 5. know IQ 70 ; 6. pervasive developmental disorder ; 7. know neurologic pathology , include epilepsy , spina bifida , cerebral palsy , traumatic brain injury , optic glioma , brain tumor ( UBOs ) . 8 . Comorbid severe psychiatric disorder also exclude . Children meet criterion ADHD , Oppositional Defiant Disorder , adjustment disorder , and/or mild depression eligible long take psychotropic medication , exception stimulant medication ADHD . Because ADHD highly comorbid NF1 ( ~50 % ; 116 ) , important finding clinical trial generalizable ( cf . 117 ) , Investigator include child ADHD include take stimulant medication . Because investigator recognize importance take ADHD account , investigator also incorporate measure ADHD ( categorical continuous variable ) well stimulant status moderator analyse . This approach consistent Lovastatin clinical trial NF1 ( e.g. , 8 ) . Reading disability ( RD ) define score less 25th percentile Letter Word Identification Word Attack subtests Woodcock Johnson Psychoeducational BatteryIII . This accepted definition RD reading research 118 . The Investigator anticipates recruit participant meet RD criterion study unlikely appeal family child struggle academically ; however , criterion meet participant include randomization procedure clinical trial , courtesy family , allow opportunity participate tutor choose . ADHD symptomology well status determine DSM5 criterion require symptoms present least two setting ; therefore , two questionnaire administer child 's parent teacher . See specific criterion ADHD diagnosis confirmation/exclusion . Measures Determine ADHD Status and/or Diagnoses : The following measure use determine ADHD status presence psychiatric diagnosis would preclude inclusion study . All measure develop DSMIV guideline . The Investigator DSM5 criterion enough time measure test DSM5 ; however measure remain appropriate capture necessary data u make determination relevant comorbid diagnosis . In particular , diagnostic criterion ADHD continue base 18 diagnostic symptom , split equally inattentive hyperactive/impulsive behavior , threshold least six symptom least one domain make diagnosis . Also DSM5 diagnostic specifier map directly onto previous DSMIV subtypes ADHD . Changes DSM5 diagnostic criterion include less stringent requirement symptom problematic 12years old compare DSMIV age 7years . There remain requirement symptom occur one setting . Overall , measure remain appropriate capture necessary data make determination ADHD diagnosis , Investigator also continuous data may pertinent research question . Parents teacher fill questionnaires clinical interview parent ( ) conduct . Conners Third Edition ( Conners 3 , 119 ) behavioral rating scale provide information variety symptom ADHD ( inattention hyperactivity/impulsivity ) well crosscut symptom anxiety , depression . Completed parent teacher use appropriate form . Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale IVHome School Versions 120 Likert scale complete child 's behavior past 6 month . The item develop ass symptom ADHD . Completed parent teacher use appropriate form . Diagnostic Interview Children , Fourth Edition ( DICAIV ; 121 ) semistructured interview , design determine psychiatric diagnosis , include ADHD . Completed parent . Behavioral Rating Inventory Executive Function 122 executive function questionnaire capture Initiate , Inhibit , Working Memory , Plan/Organize , SelfMonitor . Completed parent . Pediatric Medical Developmental History Questionnaire ( develop house ) use screen condition would preclude inclusion study provide review child 's birth , developmental , medical history . Completed parent . ADHD Status : ADHD status base DSM5 criterion . All diagnosis confirm Dr. Rimrodt , neurodevelopmental pediatrician . To meet criterion ADHD , child must score positively one two parent scale positive ADHD diagnosis DICAIV . Specifically , must rating 2 high 6 9 item assess inattention and/or 6 9 item assess hyperactivity/impulsivity ADHD Rating Scale IV and/or Tscore &gt; 65 either Inattention Hyperactivity/Impulsivity scale Conners 3 . Subjects must also meet criterion ADHD one two teacher rating scale ( Conners 3 DuPaul ) . During test child ADHD remain prescribed stimulant medication . Children consider free ADHD meet criterion ADHD parent teacher rating scale use diagnose ADHD ( i.e . must rating 2 high few 4 9 item assess inattention few 4 9 item assess hyperactivity/impulsivity ADHD Rating Scale IV Tscore &lt; 60 Hyperactivity Inattention scale parent teacher Conners 3 ) . They also meet criterion ADHD DICAIV . Participants ambiguous ADHD diagnosis</criteria>
