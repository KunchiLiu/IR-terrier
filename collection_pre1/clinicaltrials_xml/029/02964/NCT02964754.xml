	<brief_title>Digital Three-dimensional Imaging Models Repair Complex Long Bone Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>History current related study The internal fixator difficult completely fit bone surface site complex long bone fracture , reduce firmness fixation . From safety point view , establishment digital three-dimensional measurement model undoubtedly reliable intuitive way . Digital three-dimensional model establish CT scan , model greatly reflect site degree fracture , reduce anatomical parameter , high degree simulation feasibility . Adverse event 1 . The investigator record adverse event , include screw loosen fall , steel plate fracture bending , joint stiffness , delay heal non-healing , peripheral nerve injury infection . 2 . If severe adverse event occur , investigator report detail , include date occurrence measure take treat adverse event , principle investigator institutional review board within 24 hour . Data collection , management , analysis open-access 1 . Data collection : Case report form demographic data , disease diagnosis , accompany disease , drug allergy history , adverse event collect , process use Epidata software ( Epidata Association , Odense , Denmark ) , collate , record electronically data manager use double-data entry strategy . 2 . Data management : The locked electronic database accessible lock project manager , alter . All data regard trial preserve Affiliated Hospital Qinghai University , China . 3 . Data analysis : The electronic database statistically analyze professional statistician create outcome analysis report submit lead researcher . An independent data monitoring committee supervise manage trial data , ensure scientific stringent trial yield accurate complete data . 4 . Data open access : Anonymized trial data publish www.figshare.com . Statistical analysis 1 . Statistical analysis perform use SPSS 19.0 software , follow intention-to-treat principle . Normally distributed measurement data express mean ± standard deviation , minimum maximum . Non-normally distributed measurement data express low quartile ( q1 ) , median upper quartile ( q3 ) . 2 . Fisher 's exact test perform comparison total efficacy incidence adverse reaction preoperatively 6 month postoperatively . Mann Whitney U test use compare Harris score , Visual Analogue Scale , operation time hospital stay two group . The significance level α = 0.05 .</detailed_description>
