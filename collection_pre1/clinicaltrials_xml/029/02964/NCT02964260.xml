	<brief_title>RCT TAE Simultaneously Combined Thermal Ablation Large Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The treatment method `` Transarterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) sequentially combine thermal ablation '' recommend large HCC patient NCCN Guideline Chinese guideline `` Diagnosis Treatment Primary Liver Cancer '' . The detail sequential method consist one time TACE follow thermal ablation least one month later make tumor completely inactivate . The thermal ablation include multiple applicator radiofrequency microwave ablation . However , method include disadvantage . 1 ) The limitation lipiodol dosage one TACE session 30ml many patient needs session TACE ; ( 2 ) Lipiodol chemical drug easy leak patient hepatic arteriovenous fistula . ( 3 ) Repeated TACE could cause serious side effect . ( 4 ) Tumors many patient still control grow large ablate TACEs increase metastasis risk affect efficacy survival time . However , TAE simultaneously combine thermal ablation another combination type reduce interval time two procedure one month 1-3 day . TAE remove chemical drug use embolic agent Embosphere obstruct vessel enhance effect follow ablation . The main aim reduce interval remove chemical drug make tumor completely inactivate one hospitalization like surgical operation , hop bring less side effect , good efficacy longer survival time . Thus investigator launch prospective , multicenter randomize control clinical trial compare 3-years overall survival , safety , social economic benefit TAE simultaneously combine ablation TACE sequentially combine ablation . The investigator expect acquire Ia-level evidence-based medical evidence accept clinical guideline , popularizing , demonstrate therapy .</detailed_description>
