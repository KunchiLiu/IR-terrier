	<detailed_description>Extubation intracranial tumor surgery desirable order make early diagnosis intracranial complication . Extubation however , may associate haemodynamic metabolic change e.g . agitation , increase oxygen consumption , catecholamine secretion , hypercapnia systemic hypertension . These change cause cerebral hyperemia , intracranial hypertension lead cerebral oedema haemorrhage , thus important smooth extubation minimal haemodynamic metabolic effect . Incidence cough emergence general anesthesia range 38 % 96 % . This may also result postoperative intracranial hemorrhage , intracranial hypertension , cerebral edema intraocular hypertension.This detrimental neurosurgery . Several modality study prevent cough emergence , include extubation deep plane anesthesia prove unreliable . So far , reliable method recommend standard care . Tramadol , synthetic opioid aminocyclohexanes group , centrally act opioid analgesic use treat moderate-to-severe pain inhibitory effect M1 M3 muscarinic receptor . It also reduce incidence cough improve extubation quality , provide stable haemodynamics emergence . It neither cause respiratory depression , affect intracranial pressure ( ICP ) cerebral perfusion pressure ( CPP ) . Other potential advantage administer tramadol include long duration action , rapid recovery , limited depression respiratory function effect platelets thus make safe medication use neurosurgical patient craniotomy . The onset effect follow single dose 3 5 minute peak effect 45 minute . Aim study observe effect single dose tramadol quality tracheal extubation judge incidence cough haemodynamic change emergence anesthesia . OBJECTIVE : Primary Objective : To observe effect single dose tramadol ( 1mg/kg ) administer 45 minute extubation haemodynamic response ( measurement B.P H.R ) extubation . Secondary Objective : To measure quality emergence general anaesthesia measure frequency cough , laryngospasm episode desaturation . OPERATIONAL DEFINITION : Emergence Period : This define time recovery spontaneous breathe give reversal tracheal extubation . Quality emergence : Good quality emergence define extubation associate coughing , bucking , tachycardia , hypertension , laryngospasm bronchospasm . Tachycardia hypertension : Rise heart rate blood pressure 20 % baseline value . Extubation response : Physiological response relate blood pressure heart rate extubation trachea call extubation response , HYPOTHESIS : Tramadol obtund haemodynamic cough response extubation thus result good quality emergence supratentorial craniotomy .</detailed_description>
