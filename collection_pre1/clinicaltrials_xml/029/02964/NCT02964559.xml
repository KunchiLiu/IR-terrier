	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab Patients With Locally Advanced Metastatic Skin Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : -To establish response rate pembrolizumab metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : -To determine 6-month progression-free survival 1 year overall survival metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma skin ( cSCC ) treat pembrolizumab . OUTLINE : Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 3 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day every 8-12 week .</detailed_description>
