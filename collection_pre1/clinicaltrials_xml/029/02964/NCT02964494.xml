	<brief_title>The Congenital Dyserythropoietic Anemia Registry ( CDAR )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To establish maintain CDA registry ( CDAR ) : comprehensive registry subject diagnosis type congenital dyserythropoietic anemia North America . Subjects physician express interest participate national/international registry could promote research understand rare disease-group . CDAs consist heterogeneous group rare genetic disorder cause ineffective erythropoiesis characteristic finding multinuclear erythroid precursor bone marrow . The hematopoietic lineage seem unaffected . The diagnosis CDA clinically challenge base identify characteristic morphology erythroblasts bone marrow subject present chronic anemia , frequently evidence hemolysis suboptimal reticulocytosis , iron overload . Three type well-defined marrow morphology , although recent classification recognize seven different genetic type . Since certain gene defect identify different type CDAs , understand biology pathogenesis diseases improve . However , many gap still exist understand relate molecular mechanism primarily due rarity disease lack systematic approach study subject . In addition , heterogeneity observe among subject clinical overlap hematologic disorder , namely hemolytic anemia brisk erythropoietic response may associate erythroid dysplasia , ineffective erythropoiesis , complicate diagnosis often delay appropriate diagnosis therapy . The purpose CDAR establish database bio-repository CDA subject family order systematically study rare disease-group . Data regard subject collect confidentially initial presentation diagnosis periodically thereafter long period time ( &gt; 15 year ) . In addition , blood , bone marrow and/or DNA sample enrol subject store research study aim improve understanding , diagnosis , treatment CDA .</detailed_description>
