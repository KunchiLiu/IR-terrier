	<brief_summary>This pilot study part global project aim good define understand feature FBSS/POPS `` post-operative persistent syndrome patient ( shorten `` FBSS '' follow project ) . FBSS acronym Failed Back Surgery Syndrome , define chronic condition result spinal intervention . Despite anatomically successful spine surgery , significant proportion patient experience chronic refractory back leg pain . In recent multicentre study conduct 100 refractory FBSS patient , ( ESTIMET Study ) , mean delay pain occurrence FBSS diagnosis 5 year . Therefore , FBSS pattern potential responder stratification might guide u eventually develop decision tool identify FBSS patient . Easing help diagnosis FBSS improve referral yield specialist accelerate patient flow care pathway . Hence , FBSS patient , usually present long stand history pain , would access `` appropriate '' therapy earlier . This could lead good outcome . The aim multicentre , prospective study collect specific data collect routine order well define understand potential FBSS population accelerate diagnostic optimize choice appropriate treatment . A multidisciplinary approach pain management clinical network , structure Poitiers , ensure exhaustive characterization FBSS patient care pathway collect . In addition , since cooperation orthopaedic neuro spine surgeon common relationship find Europe ( observed Poitiers ) , study also aim well understand development interaction physicians/professionals substantial advantage would result bridge gap . The N3MT ( NeuroMapping Tools ) software develop Poitiers collect data assess objectively pain surface intensity change , before/after treatment , quantitative measurement , use central key project .</brief_summary>
