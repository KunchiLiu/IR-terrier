	<detailed_description>Latinas suffer disproportionately breast cancer relative non-Latina Whites ( NLWs ) , include late stage detection . While controversy breast cancer screening , non-adherence guideline-concordant screening continue major modifiable determinant breast cancer outcome disparity . Thus , increase participation breast cancer screen among Latinas , especially care corresponds clinical academic guideline , public health priority . Participatory approach popular method improve screen within group include approach 1 ) deliver education non-adherent Latinas 2 ) train community health advocate ( community health worker , breast cancer survivor ) engage breast health promotion .

Participants 150 Latinas history health volunteerism , residence one two targeted area , non-adherence US Preventive Services Task Force screen guideline . Aim 1 intervention evaluation involve analysis compare difference receipt medical record-confirmed screening within six month participate study .
