The subject willing able provide inform consent comply study protocol . 5 . The subject seek treatment nasal airway obstruction due Nasal Valve Collapse ( NVC ) willing undergo inoffice nasal implant procedure alone turbinate reduction procedure . 6 . The subject appropriate nasal facial anatomy receive Latera Implant . 7 . The subject agree followup examination twelve ( 12 ) month post operatively . 8 . The subject fail benefit appropriate maximal medical management [ e.g. , nasal steroid ( least 4 week ) ; antihistamine ; oral decongestant ; nasal strip , stent , cone ] .
