	<criteria>1 . Subject document calcific native aortic valve stenosis initial aortic valve area ( AVA ) ≤1.0 cm2 ( AVA index ≤0.6 cm2/m2 ) either mean pressure gradient ≥40 mm Hg jet velocity ≥4 m/s , measure echocardiography and/or invasive hemodynamics . 2 . Subject document aortic annulus size ≥27 mm ≤29 mm base site 's assessment preprocedure diagnostic imaging ( confirmed Case Review Committee [ CRC ] ) . 3 . Subject symptomatic aortic valve stenosis NYHA Functional Class ≥ II . 4 . There agreement heart team ( must include site investigator interventionalist site investigator cardiac surgeon ) subject high extreme operative risk surgical valve replacement ( see Note 5 definition extreme high risk , require level surgical assessment , CRC confirmation ) TAVR appropriate . Additionally , subject least one following : Society Thoracic Surgeons ( STS ) score ≥8 % OR If STS &lt; 8 , subject least one follow condition : Hostile chest Porcelain aorta Severe pulmonary hypertension ( &gt; 60 mmHg ) Prior chest radiation therapy Coronary artery bypass graft ( ) risk reoperation Severe lung disease ( need supplemental oxygen , FEV1 &lt; 50 % predict , DLCO &lt; 60 % , evidence severe pulmonary dysfunction ) Neuromuscular disease create risk mechanical ventilation rehabilitation surgical aortic valve replacement Orthopedic disease create risk rehabilitation surgical aortic valve replacement Childs Class A B liver disease ( subject Childs Class C disease eligible inclusion trial ) Frailty indicate least one following : 5‑meter walk &gt; 6 second , Katz ADL score 3/6 less , body mass index &lt; 21 , wheelchair bound , unable live independently Age ≥90 year Other evidence subject high extreme risk surgical valve replacement ( CRC must confirm agreement site heart team subject meet high extreme risk definition ) Note 5 : Risk operative mortality morbidity must assess via inperson evaluation site cardiac surgeon must confirm CRC ( must include experienced cardiac surgeon ) . Extreme operative risk high operative risk define follow : Extreme Operative Risk : Predicted operative mortality serious , irreversible morbidity risk ≥50 % 30 day . High Operative Risk : Predicted operative mortality serious , irreversible morbidity risk ≥15 % 30 day . 5 . Heart team ( must include cardiac interventionalist experience cardiac surgeon ) agree subject likely benefit valve replacement . 6 . Subject ( legal representative ) understand study requirement treatment procedure , provide write informed consent . 7 . Subject , family member and/or legal representative agree ( ) subject capable return study hospital require schedule follow visit . 1 . Subject congenital unicuspid bicuspid aortic valve . 2 . Subject acute myocardial infarction within 30 day index procedure ( define Qwave MI nonQwave MI total CK elevation ≥ twice normal presence CKMB elevation and/or troponin level elevation ) . 3 . Subject cerebrovascular accident transient ischemic attack within past 6 month prior study enrollment . 4 . Subject endstage renal disease GFR &lt; 20 ( base CockcroftGault formula ) . 5 . Subject preexist prosthetic aortic mitral valve . 6 . Subject severe ( 4+ ) aortic , tricuspid , mitral regurgitation . 7 . Subject need emergency surgery reason . 8 . Subject history endocarditis within 6 month index procedure evidence active systemic infection sepsis . 9 . Subject echocardiographic evidence new intracardiac vegetation intraventricular paravalvular thrombus require intervention . 10 . Subject Hgb &lt; 9 g/dL , platelet count &lt; 50,000 cells/mm3 &gt; 700,000 cells/mm3 , white blood cell count &lt; 1,000 cells/mm3 . 11 . Subject require chronic anticoagulation therapy implant procedure treat warfarin ( anticoagulant permit first month ) least 1 month concomitant either aspirin clopidogrel . 12 . Subject gastrointestinal bleed require hospitalization transfusion within past 3 month , clinically significant bleed diathesis coagulopathy would preclude treatment require antiplatelet regimen , refuse transfusion . 13 . Subject know hypersensitivity contrast agent adequately premedicated , know hypersensitivity aspirin , P2Y12 inhibitor , heparin , nickel , tantalum , titanium , polyurethane . 14 . Subject life expectancy le 12 month due noncardiac , comorbid condition base assessment investigator time enrollment . 15 . Subject hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy . 16 . Subject therapeutic invasive cardiac vascular procedure within 30 day prior index procedure ( except balloon aortic valvuloplasty pacemaker implantation , allow ) . 17 . Subject untreated coronary artery disease , opinion treat physician , clinically significant require revascularization . 18 . Subject severe leave ventricular dysfunction ejection fraction &lt; 20 % . 19 . Subject cardiogenic shock hemodynamic instability require inotropic support mechanical support device . 20 . Subject severe vascular disease would preclude safe access ( e.g. , aneurysm thrombus cross safely , mark tortuosity , significant narrowing abdominal aorta , severe unfold thoracic aorta , symptomatic carotid vertebral disease ) . 21 . Subject thick ( &gt; 5 mm ) protruding ulcerated atheroma aortic arch . 22 . Subject arterial access acceptable LOTUS Edge delivery system compatible Lotus Introducer define Instructions For Use . 23 . Subject current problem substance abuse ( e.g. , alcohol , etc. ) . 24 . Subject participate another investigational drug device study reach primary endpoint . 25 . Subject untreated conduction system disorder ( e.g. , Type II second degree atrioventricular block ) opinion treat physician clinically significant require pacemaker implantation ( base late available ESC guideline ) . Enrollment permissible permanent pacemaker implantation . 26 . Subject severe incapacitate dementia .</criteria>
