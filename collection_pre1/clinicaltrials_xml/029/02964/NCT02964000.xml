	<detailed_description>Previous study low level laser therapy report beneficial effect level pain patient variety chronic pain condition . We design control , double blind , randomize study determine active laser group would reduction need 'PRN pain medication ' . Screening Testing 1 . Urine-toxicology screen . 2 . Assessment level activity range motion functional capacity evaluation upper and/ low extremity . 3 . Current drug history use analgesic medication include opioid non-opioid analgesic medication . 4 . Drug history current medication along non-traditional alternative treatment ( e.g . acupuncture , massage , herbal treatment , etc . ) Protocol Outline After obtain write informed consent , patient ask complete pre-screening `` entry '' questionnaire ( e.g. , SF-36 ) . 11- point Verbal Rating Scale ( VRS ) pain rest physical activity ( 0= none 10= severe ) , level physical activity ( 0=inactive 10= fully active ) , quality sleep ( 0=poor 10=excellent ) . Current analgesic [ pain ] medication daily PRN medication . Randomized active ( Phoenix Thera-Lase [ PTL ] ) `` Low level '' PTL group use computer generate random number table . Treatment Sessions After obtain write informed consent participate study sign standard HIPPA form , patient ask describe location current pain symptom . Pre-treatment baseline assessment VRS pain rest physical activity ( e.g . walking , climb stair ) Kinesiology functional capacity evaluation ( FCE ) upper and/ low extremity low back ( depend location pain ) . Current opioid non-opioid analgesic medication usage Clinical opioid withdrawal scale ( COWS ) baseline ( COWS repeat end 1st , 2nd , 3rd week treatment ) . Treatment session - Active low level therapy 20 - 40 min Monday , Wednesday , Friday 3 week . Post- treatment session VRS pain rest ambulation immediately treatment After end 3-week treatment period Repeat pre-screening questionnaire . Kinesiology functional capacity evaluation ( FCE ) upper and/ low extremity low back ( depend location pain ) . Long-term Follow Up 30-days last treatment session , standardize follow-up questionnaire administer .</detailed_description>
