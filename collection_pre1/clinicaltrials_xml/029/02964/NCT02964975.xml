	<brief_summary>Several meta analysis compare successful Percutaneous Coronary Intervention Chronic Total Occlusion ( PCI-CTO ) unsuccessful PCI-CTO show significant reduction short-term long-term mortality . To knowledge till today prospective randomize trial compare percutaneous revascularization CTO optimal medical therapy . For reason quality live improvement one important indication revascularization elective patient CTO . In contemporary literature Seattle Angina Questionnaire ( SAQ ) psychometrically solid disease-specific instrument design ass functional status patient angina . It comprise 19 question quantify five clinically relevant domain : physical limitation , angina stability , angina frequency , treatment satisfaction disease perception/quality life . In open prospective study patient CTO coronary artery randomize two group : first - patient percutaneous coronary intervention chronic total occlusion optimal medical therapy second group - patient optimal medical therapy ( control group ) . Primary endpoint quality life secondary endpoint mayor adverse cardiovascular event ( MACE ) . All patient complete Seattle Angina Questionnaire randomization 6 month follow-up .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Coronary artery chronic total occlusion ( CTO ) define complete occlusion coronary artery last three month ( TIMI 0 coronary flow occlude segment ) . In absence serial angiogram , occlusion duration assume base clinical data regard event cause occlusion . Consensus document Euro CTO club suggest 3 level certainty : ) Certain ( angiographically confirm ) : minority case previous angiogram ( instance previous CABG operation , acute myocardial infarction ) confirm presence TIMI 0 flow &gt; 3 month prior plan procedure ; b ) Likely ( clinically confirm ) : objective evidence acute myocardial infarction territory occlude artery without possible culprit artery &gt; 3 month current angiogram ; c ) Possible ( undetermined ) : CTO TIMI 0 flow angiographic anatomy suggestive long-standing occlusion ( collateral development , contrast staining ) stable angina symptom unchanged last 3 month evidence silent ischemia ; case recent acute ischemic episode ( acute myocardial infarction unstable angina worsen effort angina ) , culprit artery occlude vessel present . CTO often find . In spite , uncertainty lesion revascularized way . If symptom objective proof ischemia viability area occlude artery distribution , recanalization CTO consider . Several study show presence chronic total occlusion collateral circulation may produce supply oxygen preserve viability . However assessment collateral circulation adenosine stress test show abnormal coronary reserve 90 % reduced mean collateral enough Therapeutically uncertainty lead partially technical complex procedure revascularization CTO PCI , success rate 60-70 % importantly low revascularization rate non-CTO lesion ( 98 % ) . During last decade significant improvement technology , equipment technique percutaneous revascularization procedure CTO increase procedural success rate ( around 90 % ) . On hand separate view regard possibility treat patient coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) , specially patient single coronary disease Metaanalysis perform O'Connor SA et al . show presence chronic total occlusion non infarct artery patient acute myocardial infarction significantly increase mortality . Furthermore several mataanalyses analyze effect PCI CTO survival , show significant reduction mortality rate short term also long term follow . Studies enrol metaanalyses retrospective prospective registry compare successful PCI CTO PCI CTO failure . There different explanation clinical result ( mortality reduction ) : 1. direct benefit achieve coronary flow myocardial perfusion improve ventricular function reduces risk malignant arrhythmia 2. patient PCI unsuccessful probably serious coronary atherosclerosis fibrosis contribute procedural failure great mortality ( 3 ) . Similar previous metaanalyses study conduct Prasada et al . show significantly great mortality group procedural failure . Study conduct Hoye et al . show significant increase 5-year mortality rate , CABG MACE group procedural failure . Authors explain difference survival pharmacological management confound factor . Also author state good prognosis successful procedure probably relate improve left ventricular function reduce risk malignant arrhythmia . To knowledge , prospective randomize study compare PCI CTO optimal medical therapy . For reason quality life improvement one important indication revascularization CTO elect patient . However , contemporary literature little data regard quality life assessment patient CTO . Quality life assessment important indicator successful revascularization patient coronary artery disease . `` Seattle Angina Questionnaire '' ( SAQ ) validate quality life assessment patient coronary artery disease . This questionnaire base five different domain : physical limitation , angina stability , angina frequency , treatment satisfaction , disease perception . So far quality life assessment SAQ use four study . Two compare result SAQ patient successful recanalization CTO patient procedural failure . They prove significant improvement SAQ score patient recanalized CTO . Third study compare revascularization strategy ( PCI vs. CABG ) optimal medical therapy patient diagnose CTO . In group treat medical therapy change score SAQ domains one year follow-up , patient revascularized CTO territory improvement SAQ score document three domain ( Physical restraint , angina frequency disease perception ) . Fourth study compare quality life CTO PCI vs.PCI non CTO lesion . In group similar improvement document domain 6 month follow-up . So far prospective randomize study conduct examine quality life patient CTO .</detailed_description>
