	<brief_title>Safety , Pharmacokinetics , Tolerability Efficacy Tolvaptan Children Adolescents With ADPKD ( Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tolvaptan demonstrate delay decline kidney function adult rapidly progress ADPKD ( CKD stag 1 3 ) measure estimate glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) Total Kidney Volume ( TKV ) . This trial first trial tolvaptan child adolescent ADPKD . Subjects study randomly assign one two group Phase A ; tolvaptan placebo . Participants equal chance assign either treatment group stratify age gender follow cohort : - Female subject age 12 14 year , inclusive - Female subject age 15 17 year , inclusive - Male subject age 12 14 year , inclusive - Male subject age 15 17 year , inclusive Phase ( A ) study last 12 month . After time , subject qualify assign tolvaptan treat tolvaptan 24 month ( Phase B ) . A qualified subject define one complete Phase A investigational medicinal product ( IMP ) , willing continue trial , adverse event ( AEs ) , would require IMP discontinuation . Participants study require make monthly visit study clinic closely monitored course study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Key Male female subject age 4 17 year ( inclusive ) diagnosis ADPKD define presence family history and/or genetic criterion AND least 10 renal cyst , measure least 0.5 cm , confirm upon magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) inspection ; subject age 12 year must least 4 cyst least 1 cm size , confirm ultrasound . Weight ≥ 20 kg . Subjects estimate glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73m2 within 31 day prior randomization ( use Schwartz formula , eGFR = 0.413 × height [ cm ] /serum creatinine mg/dL ) . Independent toileting . Ability swallow tablet . Key Liver function test include AST ( aspartate aminotransferase ) , ALT ( alanine aminotransferase ) &gt; 1.5 × upper limit normal ( ULN ) . Nocturnal enuresis . Need chronic diuretic use . Subjects advanced diabetes ( eg , glycosylated hemoglobin &gt; 7.5 , and/or glycosuria dipstick , significant proteinuria , retinopathy ) , evidence additional significant renal disease ( ) ( ie , currently active glomerular nephritides ) , renal cancer , single kidney , recent ( within 6 month screen ) renal surgery acute kidney injury . Subjects disorder thirst recognition inability access fluid . Subjects critical electrolyte imbalance , determine investigator . Subjects , risk , significant hypovolemia determine investigator . Subjects clinically significant anemia , determine investigator . Subjects 12 year age old contraindication , interference MRI assessment ( eg , ferromagnetic prosthesis , aneurysm clip , severe claustrophobia ) . Subjects history take vasopressin agonist/antagonist . Subjects take medication concomitant illnesses likely confound endpoint assessment , include take approve ( ie , market ) therapy purpose affect polycystic kidney disease ( PKD ) cysts tolvaptan , vasopressin antagonist , antisense ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) therapy , rapamycin , sirolimus , everolimus , somatostatin analog ( ie , octreotide , sandostatin ) . Subjects cyst reduction surgery within 6 week screen visit .</criteria>
