Visual display axial plane objectively candidate plan Dose-Volume Histograms also part treatment planning procedure . Dose prescription . Normalization treatment plan cover 95 % PTV prescription dose . The minimum PTV dose ( volume least 0.03 cc ) must fall 95 % prescription dose . The maximum dose within PTV must exceed 107 % prescribe dose . All RT dos calculate inhomogeneity correction take account density difference within irradiated volume ( i.e. , air , lung , soft tissue , bone ) . Dose record . The follow dose parameter record . - Prescription point dose . - Minimum maximum dose PTV average dose PTV . - Hot spot outside PTV . - Dose organ risk Dose homogeneity . - The dose prescribed PTV . Heterogeneity acceptable 95 % - 107 % . - The minimal dose target volume , identified central plane field dose distribution , 42.75 Gray ( Gy ) ( 95 % protocol dose ) control arm 34.2 Gy experimental arm . - The maximal target dose ( defined great dose target volume deliver area great 2 cm ) , identified central plane ≤ 107 % prescribe dose . ( 48.15 Gy control arm 38.52 Gy experimental arm ) . - If Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy ( IMRT ) contemplate , International commission Radiation Units ( ICRU ) 83 guideline follow . Treatment Verification . Electronic portal image , obtain course treatment first day treatment week thereafter compare digitally reconstruct image CT scan . Chemotherapy protocol All patient receive 4-6 cycle Rituximab , Cyclophosphamide , Doxorubicin , Vincristine Prednisolone ( R-CHOP ) chemotherapy base stage disease . Follow-up Protocol : All patient follow follow : - From completion radiotherapy 2 year : first visit 3 month +/- 1 month 6 monthly . - Thereafter , patient follow yearly till death . The following investigation perform every visit . - Clinical examination , weight , performance status , include common toxicity criterion adverse event ( CTCAE ) v4.0 scale acute reaction late effect - Lactate dehydrogenase ( S LDH ) , thyroid function test ( TFT ) , Complete blood count ( CBC ) , Renal function test ( RFT ) liver function test ( LFT ) clinically indicate . - A Fluoro De-oxy glucose positron emission Tomography compute tomography ( FDG-PET-CT ) scan 3 month treatment repeat partial response completion chemotherapy ( PET positive disease ) event clinical suspicion relapse . - 1 year post-radiotherapy : Pulmonary function test ( PFT ) , 2D Echo thereafter base suspicion . Treatment case progression In case disease progression relapse , patient treat salvage chemotherapy accord hospital policy . Treatment toxicity assessment Acute late toxicity assess use National Cancer Institute-Common Toxicity Criteria ( NCI-CTCAE version 4.0 ) Criteria evaluation . The definition endpoint use trial : Relapse : It define development new lesion either previously treat area , outside treat area distant sit B-symptoms follow complete remission ( CR ) least 3 month end treatment . If interval shorter event evaluate progression . Toxic effect : These measure use CTCAE version 4 Quality life ( see special section ) Survival : 1 ) Event Free Survival ( EFS ) : From time randomization till relapse progression death due cause death due disease . 2 ) Overall Survival ( OS ) : From time randomization death due cause /death due disease . Response rate measure use Revised response criterion Lymphoma International Harmonization Project . The response measure Complete response ( CR ) , Partial response ( PR ) , stable disease ( SD ) Progressive disease ( PD ) . Statistical consideration . Statistical design Sample size calculation . The trial non-inferiority design . The expected EFS ( Event Free Survival ) control arm 70 % 2 year base average EFS patient treat R-CHOP trial US Group adult lymphoma research ( GELA ) . The maximum acceptable non-inferiority margin 7 % hazard ratio 1.3 correspond 63 % EFS experimental arm 2 year . With Type I error ( α ) 0.05 ( 1 side ) power test 80 % , expect duration recruitment 4 year , minimal follow 2 year total number event need 369 , sample size 754 patient ( arm ) . Considering attrition rate 10 % , total sample size estimate 840 patient ( 420 arm ) . - One interim analysis plan primary endpoint 2.5 year 25 % likely number event ( 92 event ) observe . Using O'Brien stopping rule , boundary interim analysis final analysis 3.75 1.64 respectively . - Stopping rule criterion : The experimental arm ( reduce dose ) stop , switch control arm interim analysis , 25 % event occur experimental arm . Analyses conduct agreement intention-to-treat principle . Descriptive statistic generate range outcome variable , particular gauge whether randomization result balanced distribution patient characteristic across experimental condition . These include frequency statistic like mean , median standard deviation . Definition end-points 1 . Event Free Survival : From time randomization till relapse progression death due cause death due disease . 2 . Overall Survival : From time randomization death due cause /death due disease . 3 . Local Control : From time randomization till disease control site radiation . The test use endpoint : 1 . To estimate event free survival overall survival , Kaplan Meier curve present two arm , correspond median EFS OS , survival estimate 2 year correspond 90 % confidence interval ( CI ) . 2 . Cox proportional hazard analysis use assess effect different variable survival specifically stratification factor . The treatment effect term hazard ratio present correspond 90 % CI . Decision make base upper limit 90 % confidence interval around HR EFS . If upper limit 1.34 , low dose radiotherapy arm declare non-inferior standard arm .
