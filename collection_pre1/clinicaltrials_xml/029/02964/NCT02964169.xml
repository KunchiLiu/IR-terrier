	<detailed_description>HIV status availability ART find widely influence desirability expectation child among childbearing woman live HIV ( Nieves et al. , 2015 ; Kaida et al. , 2011 ) . Up 85 % pregnancy within 3 year follow ART often unwanted , often leading illegal abortion maternal death ( Desgrees-Du-Lou et al. , 2002 ) . Uganda 's HIV epidemic decline time sero prevalence 7.2 % decline attribute part improve prevention behavior like condom use , reduction multiple concurrent partnership strategy prevent unwanted pregnancy . Specifically , HIV prevalence estimate 7 % among woman attend antenatal clinic Uganda ( UN , 2010 ) . Whereas ART availability improve general health outcome viral load suppression immune reconstitution , still high unmet need family planning among HIV positive woman Uganda ( Snow et al. , 2011 ) , modern contraceptive prevalence 33 % general population despite widespread promotional message across country . This continue expose HIV positive woman increase risk unwanted/unplanned pregnancy , perinatal HIV transmission , pregnancy complication , increased economic burden care self others among others . The high average fertility rate 5.9 child per woman Uganda may complicate immunity wellbeing already burden HIV positive woman family even amongst already access HIV care ( Muyindike et al. , 2012 ; Homsy et al. , 2009 ) . Supporting HIV positive woman delay prevent unwanted pregnancy may improve woman 's health family planning choice , regular health review , support . A cohort study do Mbarara amongst HIV-infected woman document 50 % enrolled woman desire ( another ) child 4 year since ART initiation , 51 % serodiscordant partner , 45 % use effective contraceptive method . Key predictor contraceptive use family planning goal within DYAD . One key predictor effective contraceptive use male partner involvement CD4 count . The WHO recommend dual contraception ( use condom hormonal permanent method ) prevent HIV transmission unwanted pregnancy ( WHO,2014 ) .This prospective intervention study aim provide information whether continuous family plan accessibility support measurable impact pregnancy intention contraceptive usage among postpartum HIV positive mother deliver MRRH , SW Uganda . General objective To test effect family plan availability support intervention pregnancy intention use effective contraception among recently postpartum woman live HIV deliver MRRH . Specific objectives 1 . To assess influence intervention pregnancy intention among recently postpartum HIV positive mother deliver MRRH , SW Uganda one year intervention . 2 . To assess impact intervention ( voucher ) contraceptive uptake among recently postpartum HIV positive mother deliver MRRH , SW Uganda 3 . To assess influence intervention ( SMS +Partner involvement ) contraceptive uptake among recently postpartum HIV positive mother deliver MRRH , SW Uganda 4 . To identify factor influence pregnancy intention contraceptive use 5 . To assess influence intervention incidence unintended pregnancy among recently postpartum HIV positive mother deliver MRRH , SW Uganda 6 . To explore decision making challenge perception family planning among HIV positive woman . 7 . To assess role sexual partner pregnancy intention effective contraceptive use Methods This prospective randomized control trial 2 arm . I . The investigator intend enroll total 320 HIV positive woman deliver MRRH . The participant equally randomize intervention arm ( Family plan support ) control group ( family plan support , except routine counseling follow discharge ) . These woman follow 1 year . Their male partner also voluntarily choose participate study . Eligibility also require access mobile phone . II . Intervention group . Following delivery , participant give voucher freely access five family planning option choice . A voucher also give spouse/sexual partner due identify effect family plan utilization ( Ashraf et al. , 2014 ) . Although family plan already free , usually stock out . The voucher therefore incentive access family plan timely ( maximum 1 hour wait time ) continuously study case stock out . These include ; condom ( 40 condom ) , injectables , contraceptive pill , copper IUD contraceptive implant . The woman contact 6 week postpartum initiation family planning study nurse well trained specialize family plan care support HIV positive woman do yet . The choice family plan entirely participant . For woman select oral contraceptive pill , woman send daily [ adherence support ] reminder first 4 month , weekly reminder ( via SMS ) next 4 month monthly next 4 month . This level SMS support find positive impact adherence ( Haberer et al. , 2016 ) . Sexual partners/regular spouse woman intervention arm also receive reminder weekly [ daily monthly ] throughout study . The reminder also send monthly one choose injectable contraception [ consider whether 's 2-month 3-month injectable ] 12 study month . Daily reminder also send woman choose male female condom . Routine review family plan do woman intervention arm alongside routine visit HIV clinic post-natal PMTCT visit . Interviews study participant do baseline , 6 12 month postpartum . The spouses/ sexual partner contact , enrol interviewed baseline , 6 month 1 year . III . Control group : These counsel family plan discharge enrol . They interview baseline , 6 month 1 year . Data reproductive history , HIV/AIDS experience , socio-sexual relationship , fertility aspiration , use knowledge family planning , decision making , perception Family planning , alcohol use , food security , education , socio-economic , side effect undesirable effect , economic social support document . Natural family plan method like lactation amenorrhea , withdrawal method others present mixed literature , paint grim picture effectiveness standalone contraceptive method especially among HIV positive woman . All woman advise exclusively breast feed 6 month ART ( MoH , 2015 ) . Because hormonal contraception inclusive estrogen interferes breast milk production among lactate mother , progestin-only method recommend woman . IV . Randomization : Consecutive number range 001 320 computer generate indicate 2 main group mother randomly assign enrol . These consecutive number label top opaque envelope . To eligible , mother must HIV positive , delivery within last 48 hour , 18 year age , anticipate begin family plan 6 week postpartum , must mentally stable qualify family plan method available . Once eligibility mother confirm , invite participate study . The aim study detail procedure involve trial , potential side effect therapeutic benefit explain randomization occur . Once mother consent participate study , study number allocate nurse research assistant ( recruit work ward/post natal clinic study ) take next series similar opaque envelope provide conceal allocation group . These opaque envelope label computer-generated list number group allocation ( either Intervention group Control Group ) mother randomize block 20 . Nurse research assistant blind group allocation eligibility study participation confirm . The research assistant also blind hypothesis study . A blood sample drawn baseline confirm HIV status CD4 cell count case unknown time enrollment . This do support woman enroll recommend Option B+ case woman yet lifelong ART ] . A different study nurse enrol train specifically collect data participant . The socio-demographic data obstetric characteristic document . Other document potential covariates contraceptive use like participant age , primary partner 's age , primary partner 's HIV status , personal partner fertility desire , number child , recent CD4 cell count , Efavirenz-containing ART Regimen ( due association decreasing level hormonal contraception thus recommend dual method teratogenicity concerns- although concern find exaggerated ) , socio-economic status , body mass index , education level , time ART . Prior contraceptive use experience , fertility desire/ pregnancy intention aspiration measure use CDC pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System Instrument ( Ahluwalia et al. , 1999 ) Effective contraception use define consistent use [ self report observational chart review study nurse family plan clinic ] family planning method ( include consistent condom use ) , include dual contraception ( use condoms another contraceptive method-hormonal permanent ) HIV-sero discordant couples/partners ( participant know partner 's status ) . A primary partner define either regular spouse , also regular sexual partner recent sexual partner main partner name . These sexual partner also enrol interviewed baseline 1 year . In case consent mother end serious adverse event , time indication document report . In case woman change contraceptive method , reason change also document . Data Preparation All data cross check completeness entry . Data cod enter independently excel sheet export STATA Version 12 statistical analysis . For variable , reference category identify . Data Analysis Plan Data analysis intention-to-treat ( ITT ) consist mother randomize thus suppose treat ( Lesaffre , 2008 ) . Descriptive statistic use describe key characteristic study participant . Different variable explore normal distribution . Continuous variable compare binary outcome contraception effectiveness pregnancy intention use t- test . Selected demographic , clinical , post-natal factor compare difference similarity three group . Crude relative risk derive . Relative risk 95 % confidence Interval ( two tail ) calculate use compare contraception effectiveness pregnancy intention group . Factors associate effective contraception use pregnancy intention explore use univariate analysis result whose p value ≤ 0.10 , multivariate analysis do rule confound factor . Data Reporting The mean present standard deviation . Relative risk odds ratio present 95 % confidence Intervals . Two-tailed statistical analysis use statistical significance define level p &lt; 0.05 .</detailed_description>
