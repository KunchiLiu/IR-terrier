	<brief_summary>Patients assume cognitive performance rapidly return baseline anesthesia surgery . Several study show one week major non-cardiac surgery 27 % patient postoperative cognitive dysfunction ( POCD ) 10 % patient 3 month . Very study assess incidence POCD beyond 3 month . POCD significantly reduce quality life . Identifying risk factor POCD important associate prolonged hospital stay , loss independence , premature retirement . There urgent need measure document level cognitive change associate surgery easy use tool , prior admission discharge . This information use plan appropriate care path identify test efficacy potential new treatment alter negative trajectory .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Postoperative cognitive dysfunction ( POCD ) think affect significant proportion patient major surgery ( 10 % 3 month ) . This potentially major public health issue patient POCD prolong hospital admission , loss independence mortality . Undoubtedly , POCD prevalent devastate previously report , decision undergo elective surgery influence risk develop POCD . Given scope issue , deficiencies literature surround POCD concern . There many methodological issue previous study diagnosis POCD perioperative period . It imperative true nature postoperative cognitive change elucidate preoperative risk stratification appropriately determine . This lead care pathways intervention modify possible downward change thereby reduce negative impact patient health care system . Study Hypothesis : The incidence postoperative cognitive change joint arthroplasty population influence postoperative complication , pre-existing mild cognitive impairment , pre-existing comorbid condition . Study Objectives : 1 . To conduct pilot study six 12 month assess rate recruitment ( goal 15 participants/month ) postoperative in-person follow-up ( 6 week 4.5 month ) , determine large-scale study 600 participant feasible 2 . To determine sensitivity accuracy Cognigram ( CogState Brief Battery - CBB ) detecting change cognitive function perioperative period 3 . To determine whether pre-existing mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) , preoperative chronic inflammatory state , acute postoperative complication affect change postoperative cognitive function</detailed_description>
