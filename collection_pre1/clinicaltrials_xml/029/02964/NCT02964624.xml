	<brief_summary>Osteoarthritis ( OA ) common type degenerative joint disease . Furthermore , despite incidence amongst high chronic disease , effective biomarkers , diagnostic aid image technology available assist management OA . Mounting evidence suggest non-pharmacological treatment exercise/physical therapy may lower risk onset progression OA mitigate inflammation . However , mechanical unload overloading , see disuse overuse , lead upregulation several proinflammatory molecule enhance tissue degradation , whereas , dynamic moderate mechanical loading exerts anti-inflammatory anti-catabolic effect articular cartilage suppress mediator inflammation . However , lack robust biomarkers measure effectiveness physical therapy , represent critical gap biotechnology , obliterate progress optimal application therapy . Our central hypothesis circulating level specific molecule could serve robust biomarkers quantitative measure OA burden , prognosis , progression treatment efficacy . The objective project identify evaluate mediator serve biomarkers OA progression treatment . Recently , high mobility group box chromosomal protein 1 ( HMGB-1 ) suggest markedly upregulated OA . However , presently inhibitor HMGB1 could use therapeutically . Previous result show gentle exercise tool mitigate HMGB1 production local systemic macrophage , thus inflammation . Serum concentration HMGB1 evaluate biomarker OA patient relate functional capacity knee joint OA patient rehabilitation protocol ( RP ) . The RP consist three rehabilitation session/week eight week . The efficacy RP evaluate functional scale Western Ontario &amp; McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis ( WOMAC ) , Scale measurement health relate quality life use EuroQol five dimension questionnaire ( EuroQOL-5D ) , Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) , physical function test . Besides clinical assessment , serum level classical pro-inflammatory cytokine , hyaluronan HMGB1 evaluate . A correlation physical improvement RP serum biomarkers perform .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Detailed Description : Methods/Design 1 . Participants textually verbally informed right , benefit possible risk , objective methodology study , participant sign free informed consent form . 2 . Study Design Prior rehabilitation protocol ( RP ) , participant perform one adaptation session functional test apply minimize learning bias . In second session 5 minute warm cycle ergometer ( CEE ) , Time Up Go ( TUG ) test apply , follow isometric strength test . In third day , warm , one repetition maximum test conduct . At end RP , test repeat . Blood sample collect baseline ( day 0 ) , 1 month ( day 30 RP ) 2 month ( day 60 RP ) . 2.1 . Rehabilitation protocol ( RP ) The RP consist 3 exercise session/week 8 week . Each session begin evaluation pain participant . If pain high four , analgesic protocol ( AP ) contain ultra-sound , laser transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation ( TENS ) apply . After AP , participant execute rehabilitation protocol pain decrease low four . Starting warm exercise cycle ergometer ( CEE ) , 5 minute free cadence , intensity set 90 % intensity obtain incremental test ( see item 2.2a ) maintain 10 min . Afterward , four set ( 8-12 repetition ) three different resistance exercise ( RE ) ( leg press , knee extension knee flexion ) perform 70 % load correspondent 1RM test ( see item 2.2b ) one minute interval set exercise . During CEE Borg scale take every two minute RE omnibus ( OMNI ) scale take end every set monitor intensity . At end session , cool global stretching exercise inferior member perform VAS evaluate . Ten second tension stretch position target hamstring , quadriceps , gluteus maxim ums , gastrocnemius , thigh adductor abductor . 2.2 . Rehabilitation intensity parameter . 1 . Cycle ergometer incremental test ( CEEIT ) . After 5 minute warm free cadence cycle ergometer , intensity increase every 3 minute participant register 11 13 Borg scale consider moderate intensity correlate blood lactate concentration threshold anaerobic threshold , respectively . 2 . One repetition maximum . The test start warm 5 10 repetition estimate moderate load ( ± 40-60 % 1RM ) . After 1 minute rest 3 5 repetition perform high load ( ±60-80 % 1RM ) 5 minute rest . Then one attempt estimate 1RM give . If participant fail lift load two repetition test stop , otherwise 5 minute rest load increase test performed . Only five attempt per day permit maintain test reliable . Sample size calculation The estimation sample size determine basis great improvement subscale physical function WOMAC score , use G.Power 3.15 software . Based 10 % expect difference baseline measure RP standard deviation 30 physical function WOMAC , 65 participant need significance level 0.05 , power 80 % .</detailed_description>
