	<detailed_description>Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension ( CTEPH ) rare potentially life-threatening disease pulmonary circulation . Management CTEPH require precise differential diagnosis , long life anticoagulation confirm qualification surgical treatment experience multidisciplinary team . The gold standard treatment operable patient pulmonary endarterectomy ( PEA ) , highly effective restore functional status improve life expectancy . Nevertheless , even lead CTEPH referral centre almost 50 % patient remain medical treatment alone , grim perspective regard life quality expectancy . Recently , balloon pulmonary angioplasty ( BPA ) emerge promise new interventional option non-operable CTEPH . The development BPA far rapid . It take 13 year first case-report publication first series 17 patient treat BPA Boston/US another 13 year result first European series 20 patient report Oslo/Norway . In Poland BPA start perform non-operable CTEPH patient 2013 , motivate expect poor prognosis , compare surgical PEA offer . The aim study analysis efficacy safety BPA procedure . The BPA perform two senior interventional specialist - cardiologist radiologist extensive experience coronary , pulmonary general vessel intervention support perfusion nurse . All patient undergo BPA give inform consent first BPA intervention . The limited experience experimental nature BPA emphasise candidate . A standard BPA procedure typically perform right femoral vein , anticoagulation unfractionated heparin periprocedural period . A long ( 70 90 cm ) sheath introduce pulmonary trunk support pigtail catheter . Selective super-selective catheterisation lobar artery , segmental appropriate subsegmental artery perform demonstrate variety clot : `` web '' , `` ring '' , `` occlusion '' , `` pouch '' lesion reduction parenchymal opacification injection vascular contrast medium . Balloon catheter ( diameter 1.25-6.0 mm ) position select lesion dilate several second . Immediate selective angiography perform dilation confirm satisfactory result present improvement contrast medium distribution venous return . Control angiography do rule residual stenosis sign vessel injury . Following BPA procedure , patient move ICU 48 h surveillance . Right initiation BPA 3-6 month last session , full workup make , include : World Health Organization ( WHO ) functional class , 6-minute walk test ( 6MWT ) , concentration biomarkers ( NT-proBNP , Troponin T , sST2 ) , cardiopulmonary exercise test , echocardiography , electrocardiography right heart catheterization include measurement right atrial pressure ( RAP ) , pulmonary artery pressure ( PAP ) , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure ( PCWP ) , cardiac output ( CO ) , cardiac index ( CI ) , pulmonary vascular resistance ( PVR ) , mixed venous oxygenation ( MVsat.O2 ) systemic oxygenation ( AOsatO2 ) . Additionally patient fill Short Form 36 ( SF36 ) quality life questionnaire initiation BPA 3-6 month last session .</detailed_description>
