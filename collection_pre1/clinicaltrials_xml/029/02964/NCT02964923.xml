	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate effect Second-Generation Antipsychotic ( SGAs ) glucose lipid metabolic parameter patient schizophrenia , explore relationship gene polymorphism ( drug metabolic enzyme , Endogenous Cannabinoid Receptor Type 1 ( CB1 ) ) SGAs-induced glucose lipid metabolic disorder Chinese Han person schizophrenia take one SGAs ( olanzapine , risperidone ziprasidone ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genes Polymorphisms Metabolic Effects Second Generation Antipsychotic Drugs Patients With Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SGAs use main tool treat schizophrenia , however，the mechanism glucose lipid metabolism disorder brings still unclear . Based previous study , investigator find CB1 gene close connection metabolism disorder.The investigator suppose CB1 also significant role regulation energy metabolism hypothalamus . In study , investigator recruit 300 Patients schizophrenia define Diagnostic Statistical Manual-5 ( DSM-5 ) , age 18 60 , participant receive 6-week systematic treatment one SGAs ( include olanzapine , risperidone oral solution , ziprasidone capsule ) , battery assessment treatment effect safety . Plasma concentration test regularly , gene polymorphisms CB1 associate energy metabolism conduct second generation gene detection techniques.This study could provide evidence data achieve aim individualized medication , reduce drug ' side effect , also throw light production medication correct metabolism disorder .</detailed_description>
