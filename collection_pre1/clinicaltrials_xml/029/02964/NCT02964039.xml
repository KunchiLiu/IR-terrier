	<brief_title>A Novel Mechanics-based Intervention Improve Post-stroke Stability</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Every year , approximately 15,000 American Veterans experience stroke , estimate cost acute follow-up care hundred million dollar . Following stroke , restoration improvement walk high-ranking goal among patient , half population able return typical level community ambulation . The resultant decrease independent mobility strongly associate decline quality life . Gait instability common contributor limited mobility either increase fall-risk fear fall , current intervention address post-stroke gait instability limit success . This project conduct initial test novel elastic force-field design improve post-stroke gait stability target motor learn . The result experiment serve basis development novel gait rehabilitation technique , potential increase quality life thousand Veterans save million dollar .</detailed_description>
