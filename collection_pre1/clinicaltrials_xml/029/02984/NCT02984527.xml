	<detailed_description>The study crossover clinical trial effect two intervention compare subject . The two intervention : - Intimate hygiene water soap - Intimate hygiene prepackaged disposable wet wipe Null hypothesis : Same effectiveness reduce microbiological count skin Alternative hypothesis : Significant different effectiveness reduce microbiological count skin Each individual receive two intervention random order . The effect intervention microbiological count patient skin evaluate patient . A crossover trial require half number participant reduce confound factor . All participant receive sequence two different intervention . But sufficient gab two intervention ensure washout period avoid crossover effect . In study 12-24 hour . The study use block randomization , without intra block correlation achieve allocation balance time . Furthermore may prevent predictable allocation . Microbiological sampling moisten swap aseptic technique , sterile equipment sterile recovery medium ( Stewarts Medium ) use obtain skin sample patient intimate hygiene water soap wet wipe . Differences microbiological skin count compare ( delta value ) two intervention intervention . Data blind microbiological count statistical analysis . Analyses : Data structure CASTOR store secure Team Collaboration Software Tool ( SharePoint ) . Descriptive analysis include mean , median , confidence interval , standard deviation , standard error . Statistical analysis perform use STATA . Test difference perform simple t- test Wilcoxon sign rank test , depend distribution data . A multiple regression analysis include possible confounders consider .
