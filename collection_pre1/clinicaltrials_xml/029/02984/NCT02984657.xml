	<brief_title>Reverse Trendelenburg Positioning Its Effect Outcomes : Retrospective Study Consecutive Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intraoperative pulmonary aspiration cause death lead morbidity . In addition , reliable estimate aspiration rate uncertain . In part , ambiguity relate lack prospective data . Relevant study retrospective chart review result voluntary reporting database . Furthermore , aspiration diagnosis imprecise . The finding certain aspiration bile particulate matter tracheobronchial tree endoscopic visualization . However , diagnosis presumptive intraoperative postoperative development new chest x-ray infiltrate attendant tachypnea , hypoxia , wheeze , change ventilator airway pressure . Most patient undergo general endotracheal anesthesia supine horizontal position . However , evidence literature demonstrate supine position mechanically ventilated patient risk aspiration ventilator associate pneumonia ( VAP ) . During intensive care unit ( ICU ) mechanical ventilation , Institute Healthcare Improvement recommend elevate head bed prevent pulmonary aspiration VAP . Other investigation show profound relationship horizontal position intra-operative aspiration . There substantial operating room , ICU , animal investigative evidence aspiration occur despite presence cuffed endotracheal tube . Likewise , previous work group show 30 % perioperative hypoxemia rate , significantly associate horizontal positioning . The post-operative length hospital stay 2 day longer hypoxemia , compare hypoxemia ( p &lt; 0.0001 ) represent total 300 additional day 2 month study . The purpose retrospective study repeat investigation adopt recent policy change 10-degree Reverse Trendelenburg position routine surgical patient , unless deem inappropriate either anesthesiology operating room nursing staff .</detailed_description>
