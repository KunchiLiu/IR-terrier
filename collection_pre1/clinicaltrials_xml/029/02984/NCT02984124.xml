	<brief_title>Communication During Hospitalization About Resuscitation Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Increasing evidence suggest high quality palliative care old patient improve quality care , patient family satisfaction , cost care . However , specific palliative care intervention investigate , exactly provide care remain unclear . One important component high quality provider-patient communication discuss cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) within context patient 's value goal care . Unfortunately , conversation often rush , focused procedure rather patient 's goal value , CPR often offer choice menu . Elderly hospitalized patient unlikely make decision CPR prior hospitalization , discussion often leave patient family feel burden , stress , concern . Outcomes in-hospital CPR chronically ill old patient continue poor , despite decade effort toward improvement . The investigator aim change paradigm CPR discussion older adult unlikely benefit CPR . This study randomize control trial compare innovative `` informed assent '' approach discuss CPR versus usual care attention control old hospitalize adult life-limiting illness severe functional impairment , enrol patient family member three different study site . Informed assent include : 1 ) elicit value goal , 2 ) explain CPR context illness , 3 ) care statement patient receive CPR value include avoid burdensome therapy unlikely provide benefit . Thus , provider elicit value , convey information , state assessment , allow patient family disagree . The investigator hypothesize informed assent improve quality satisfaction communication CPR ; reduce burden potentially harmful CPR discussion , include reduce patient family symptom depression anxiety ; reduce intensity care health care utilization . The intervention build prior work investigate CPR outcome older adult perform pilot study inform assent intervention inpatient outpatient .</detailed_description>
