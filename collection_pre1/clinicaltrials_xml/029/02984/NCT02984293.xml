	<brief_summary>Statins widely use drug treat hypercholesterolaemia . In general , safe drug . However , one third statin user experience muscle symptom , commonly mild without conventional laboratory sign muscle damage . However , muscle symptom often lead poor compliance cholesterol-lowering therapy , reduce effectiveness . Recent data highlight potential role immune system development statin-induced muscle pain . Variation LILRB5 gene associate statin intolerance . We aim investigate impact LILRB5 genetic variability tolerability immune response atorvastatin healthy volunteer . The study undertaken Tayside Institute Cardiovascular Research ( TICR ) Ninewells Hospital , Dundee . We recruit participant donate sample GoSHARE study . The participant healthy , recruit accord genotype LILRB5 ( information available GoSHARE ) . The volunteer enter randomise cross-over study two treatment period . During treatment period one , participant commence atorvastatin placebo ( dummy drug ) . Before end treatment period , blood urine sample take muscle symptom questionnaire complete assess tolerability immune response study drug exposure . After four week , study drug stop washout period three week cross-over commences . Thereafter , treatment period two , alternate study drug start , tolerability assess similar period one . The study last approximately 11 week . The volunteer total 5 visit TICR .</brief_summary>
