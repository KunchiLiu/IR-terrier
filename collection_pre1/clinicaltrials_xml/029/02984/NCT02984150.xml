	<brief_title>Effect Intragastric Administration Fatty Acids Generalized Reward Sensitivity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Earlier research Faculty Economics Business ( FEB ) demonstrate generalization reward sensitivity sensory stimulation different domain . As increased sensory stimulation sexual domain ( Van den Bergh et al . 2008 ) power domain ( Briers et al . 2007 ) , preference immediate small financial reward increase deferred pay . Hongda , DeWitte &amp; Warlop ( 2008 ) able neutralize effect domain-specific financial satiation . In research , The investigator investigate possible influence ( subliminal ) intragastric administration fatty acid reward sensitivity power domain , whether effect generalize financial sexual domain . Previous research Translational Research Center Gastrointestinal Disorders ( TARGID ) show administration neutralize effect mood-priming ( Van Oudenhove et al. , 2011 ) . This study aim examine implication finding motivational domain . 60 healthy heterosexual men come lab twice , fatty acid condition , control condition ( counterbalance , randomly assign sequence condition ) . In session dv 's measure ( first three task counterbalance , progressive ratio task always end ) . At end second session , participant also compete series interindividual difference measure ( scale ) . This research form start collaboration TARGID Center Research Marketing Consumer Science KU Leuven Faculty Business Economics . The current paradigm largely base early study Prof. Dr. Lukas Van Oudenhove show effect intragastric administration identical fatty acid solution test mood regulation ( Van Oudenhove et al. , 2011 ) . The procedure perform study , place thin nasogastric tube frequently use TARGID research research absolutely proven safe , mention adverse reaction numerous previous study . Similar study research group already approve Medical Ethics Committee , always see Prof . Tack ensure study conduct researcher receive adequate training acquire sufficient experience specific procedure start study . The procedure carry healthy volunteer perfectly safe manner .</detailed_description>
