	<detailed_description>Cochlear implant use cochlea ( part inner ear ) send electrical signal activation auditory nerve restore hearing deaf patient . For patient without function auditory nerve , auditory brainstem implant ( ABI ) , place surface brainstem central location restore hearing . Unfortunately , hear performance ABI typically low performance cochlear implant . There several reason low success ABI . Due tumor and/or tumor removal process NF2 condition , potential damage cause brainstem level link poor performance . The anatomical change cause tumor also make difficult properly visualize place ABI surface array correct location . In addition , large tumor need remove , large cavity brainstem space possibility ABI surface array move initial location time . Therefore , past 16 year , new implant develop international collaboration present electrical stimulus midbrain region , inferior colliculus . This new implant call auditory midbrain implant ( AMI ) . The current version consist two shank 11 electrode contact linearly space along shank . The two shank insert inferior colliculus align electrodes along different pitch layer able stimulate individually vary temporal pulse pattern . In period 2006 2010 , former version current AMI implant evaluated five NF2 deaf patient hear restoration . This first AMI implant consist one shank contrast current two-shank array . Encouragingly , clinical trial time show AMI safe five patient . All patient achieve improvement hear capacity , especially form environmental sound awareness lip-reading enhancement . One patient additionally attain good speech perception within upper range ABI NF2 patient . However , speech perception yet level attain cochlear implant patient . Based experience additional study animal , develop second version AMI consist two shank implant inferior colliculus expect provide significant improvement hear performance compare previous AMI stimulate effectively across three-dimensional inferior colliculus . The purpose clinical trial evaluate safety , reliability , performance new two-shank AMI deaf NF2 patient . The ability consistency place AMI array inferior colliculus also evaluate .</detailed_description>
