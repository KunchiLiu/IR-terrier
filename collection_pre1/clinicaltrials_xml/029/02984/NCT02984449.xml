	<brief_summary>Rationale : Patients undergo cardiac surgery risk develop perioperative complication major adverse cardiac event , mainly related preoperative status type surgical procedure . Postoperative exercise base cardiac rehabilitation ( CR ) effective therapy prolong survival improve quality life . However , little known effect post-operative complication , quality life return work combine pre- post-operative CR program encompass physical therapy , dietary counseling , psychological support life style management compare CR program , provide cardiac surgery . Objective : determine whether pre- postoperative ( PRE+POST ) CR program improve short ( three month ) long term outcome ( one year ) cardiac surgery ( i.e . reduction postoperative surgical complication , readmission hospital major adverse cardiac event conjunction improvement physical component health relate quality life ) , compare postoperative CR ( POST ) . Study design : A Prospective Randomized Open control trial , Blinded End-point . Patients randomize two standard care CR program . One group start POST CR program surgery . The group randomize combined PRE+POST CR program . Study population : Patients ( age &gt; 18 year ) admit elective coronary bypass surgery , valve surgery and/or aortic surgery Main study parameters/endpoints : The primary outcome composite weight endpoint postoperative surgical complication , re-admissions hospital , major adverse cardiac event health relate quality life ( two domain : physical function physical problem ) , three month one year surgery . Endpoints determine independent endpoint committee , blind group allocation . Secondary , study focus physical health ( cardiorespiratory fitness , muscle strength functional status ) , psychological health ( feeling anxiety depression ) , work participation , economics , lifestyle risk factor ( physical activity smoke behavior ) , self-efficacy illness representation .</brief_summary>
