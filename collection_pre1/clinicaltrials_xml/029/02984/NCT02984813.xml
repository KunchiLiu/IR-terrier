	<brief_summary>This study multi-armed protocol design evaluate safety efficacy two different combination nutritional supplement ( study drug ) ( Glauco-Health Glauco-Select ) choose potential protect retinal ganglion cell oxidative stress , low-grade inflammation , mitochondrial dysfunction patient open-angle glaucoma diabetic retinopathy . Oxidative stress retinal cellular dysfunction measure use Retinal Metabolic Analyzer ( RMA ) randomize , single center , double mask study . Patients glaucoma divide three treatment arm randomize receive either Glauco-Health , Glauco-Select , placebo .</brief_summary>
