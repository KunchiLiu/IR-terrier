	<brief_title>FLABRA : Frontline Approach BRCA Testing OC Treatment naïve Population . A LATIN AMERICA Epidemiologic Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>FLABRA cross-sectional , multi-center , epidemiological observational study design evaluate prevalence BRCA mutation newly diagnose ovarian cancer patient across understudied ethnic group Latin America . Secondary objective study evaluate prevalence sBRCAm versus gBRCAm newly diagnose ovarian cancer patient describe current ovarian cancer counsel treatment approach pattern front line set across Latin America . In Screening Visit , consecutive eligible patient newly diagnose ovarian cancer within last 120 day invite participate . After provided consent , patient ask provide ethnicity cancer family history information . Patients self-identify one define broad ethnic group ( Native American , Afro-Caribbean , Caucasian ) base self-reported ancestry information . Archived tumor block twenty 10-µm section eligible patient request local pathology lab use BRCA mutation test . Patient medical record review data relevant ovarian cancer diagnosis , include basic demographic , medical history , treatment history . During Devolution Visit , result tumor BRCA test communicate patient , information counsel approach treatment plan record medical chart . This Devolution Visit last visit study case non-mutated patient . For patient BRCA mutation identify tumor , additional test blood look specific point mutation find tumor perform investigate patient harbor germline BRCA mutation . For patient visit organise communicate result patient data regard germline test result record medical chart patient .</detailed_description>
