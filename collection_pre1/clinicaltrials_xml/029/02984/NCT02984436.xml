	<brief_summary>This prospective observational cohort study ED patient acute chest pain symptom suggestive ACS . Blood sample collect study participant High-Sensitivity Cardiac Troponin T ( hs-cTnT ) analysis . Results hs-cTnT used research purpose . Providers blind result participant treat healthcare provider per standard care . Participants 30 90 day phone follow-up ascertain study outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>High-Sensitivity Cardiac Troponin T OPtimize Chest Pain Risk Stratification</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 8 million - 10 million patient complain chest pain present Emergency Department ( ED ) annually United States . To avoid miss diagnosis acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) , physician use liberal testing strategy . Thus , &gt; 50 % ED patient acute chest pain hospitalize comprehensive cardiac evaluation ( serial cardiac biomarkers stress test angiography ) . However , &lt; 10 % patient ultimately diagnose ACS , pervasive over-triage cost estimate $ 10 billion - $ 13 billion annually . Current care pattern acute chest pain fail focus health system resource , hospitalization stress testing , patient likely benefit . It demonstrate accelerated diagnostic protocol ( ADP ) , call HEART Pathway , utilizes clinical decision aid ( HEART score ) serial Cardiac Troponin ( cTn ) measure sensitive ACS ( &gt; 99 % ) substantially reduce hospitalization , stress testing , cost compare usual care . The HEART Pathway use contemporary serial cTn measurement 0 3 hour exclude index myocardial infarction ( MI ) rely clinical feature ( history , ECG , age , risk factor ) identify patient likely downstream event . However , HEART Pathway limitation : ) It identify 20 - 40 % patient early discharge b ) develop high-sensitivity cTn assay become available . Able detect MI earlier great accuracy contemporary assay , hs-cTn assay potential integrated decision aid improve chest pain risk stratification . In near future , hs-cTn assay replace contemporary assay United States .</detailed_description>
