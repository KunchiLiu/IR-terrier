	<brief_summary>BACKGROUND : Despite prevalence patellofemoral ostearthritis ( OA ) , joint receive relatively little attention OA literature treatment option individual patellofemoral OA . Patellar misalignment associate radiographic progression patellofemoral OA symptom magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , cartilage loss measurement bone marrow lesion . The hypothesis correction patella disorder use strategy brace adhesive bandage handle symptom progression OA . OBJECTIVE : To compare effect brace design stabilize patellofemoral joint compare neoprene sleeve kneecap opening patient patellofemoral OA . METHODS : Fifty-two patient patellofemoral OA co-morbidities ( Two : overweight obesity , hyperglycemia , dyslipidemia , hyperuricemia , high blood pressure ) divide two group accord knee brace receive : Functional Bracing patellofemoral ( group 1 ) neoprene knee sleeve patella opening ( group 2 ) . Both group orient clinical treatment osteoarthritis metabolic syndrome ask daily exercise addition report daily consumption drug month place orthotics three month place . They evaluate questionnaire WOMAC Lequesne , ask perform five-times-sit-to-stand-test , Timed-up-and-go ( TUG ) six-minute walk test moment immediately prior placement brace , one , three 12 month brace .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All patient sign inform consent randomize asked participate 4-hour course knee osteoarthritis . They send home form fill medication consume daily month . They return hospital accord data give www.randomization.com , receive one two brace one knee depend symptom . The functional brace medial , lateral , superior inferior `` ruber band '' center patella patella groove . The traditional neoprene sleeve brace patellar opening also try reinforcement neoprene sleeve . Prior bracing , patient deliver prior month medication form , answer WOMAC Lequesne questionnaire , perform TUG , FTSST six-minute walk test . They instruct use brace 2 hour first day increase half hour per day maximum 12 hours/day . In case difficulty brace 12 continuous hour , allow use least 4 hour 2 hour interval return bracing . Patients sleep/rest without brace ( ) . They use brace physical activity unless water . The primary objective evaluate compare short-term benefit knee stabilization compression . Therefore , follow-up assessment , make prior brace one three month . The evaluation include delivery registration medication consume daily ( along hour use orthosis ) , WOMAC Lequesne questionnaires functional evaluation . X-rays without brace ( Front Schuss , profile Axial ) measurement affect joint space make inclusion one year . Panoramic X-rays low limb perform inclusion measure internal external femoral-tibial angle . Complaints ( pain , slip , swell , skin lesion ) satisfaction ( decrease pain , mobility improvement ) use brace seek encounter . Patients ask weekly physical activity ( intensity , type hour physical activity ) adverse effect use orthotics . Weight height measure assessment calculate BMI . The secondary objective improvement pain , stiffness long-term function ( 1 year ) . Therefore , brief analysis result three month , clinically significant difference group , patient use brace best result . Therefore study case series . If group show clinically relevant improvement significant difference orthotics , study remain two arm clinical assessment , questionnaire , functional radiographic one year . If none group show clinically relevant improvement three month , study terminate . Adverse effect use orthotics also record one-year visit . All patient advise discontinue use brace telephone secretary case adverse effect period official evaluation proper conduct .</detailed_description>
