	<brief_summary>Synopsis : In country , increase number parent refuse , vaccine adopt delay vaccination schedule . Vaccine hesitancy ( VH ) global phenomenon need measure addressed . However , date , effective strategy identify . Dr Gagneur develop validate new approach educate parent newborns vaccination , base motivational interviewing ( MI ) technique . MI method elicit strengthen motivation change base person 's argument change show effective adoption many preventive health behavior . This approach validate vaccination pilot study well provincial RCT Quebec . Now proof concept make Quebec , investigator validate approach context ( e.g . English-speaking province setting different way deliver maternity care childhood vaccine ) . Hypothesis : An educational strategy , base MI technique , deliver maternity ward increase parent ' intention vaccinate infant , reduce VH score increase infant ' vaccine uptake Quebec . This approach may applicable across country order tackle VH thus improve infant ' vaccine coverage ( VC ) . Objective : To evaluate impact MI intervention parent ' intention vaccinate child VH score infant ' VC 3 month age , pan-Canadian context . Methods : Multicentre RCT maternity ward 5 province ( QC , BC , ON , NS/PE ) . Parents randomize receive MI intervention ( intervention group ) receive information flyer vaccine ( control group ) . MI intervention deliver research assistant first receive standardized training session content technique MI . Parents complete self-administered questionnaire measure knowledge vaccination intention well VH intervention . Immunization data collect online questionnaire send child reach 3 month age . Expected benefit : The strategy validate across different immunization program 5 Canadian province take account difference logistics cultural context . Results study provide provincial national public health authority effective strategy tackle VH .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES Main objective : To evaluate impact motivational interviewing ( MI ) intervention parent ' intention vaccinate infant vaccine hesitancy ( VH ) score Pan-Canadian context . In order explore difference intervention 's impact accord cultural organizational factor , analysis also conduct level center . Specific objective : 1 . To assess parent ' intention vaccinate infant intervention immediately intervention , globally center level . 2 . To assess parent ' VH score intervention , immediately intervention infant 3 month age , globally center level . 3 . To assess parent ' knowledge , attitude beliefs ( KAB ) vaccination intervention , immediately intervention infant 3 month age : - Descriptive analysis accord composite model inspire Health Belief Model ( HBM ) , Theory Planned Behavior , VH measure ( base validate questionnaire ) ; - Research determinant vaccination intention . 4 . To compare vaccine coverage ( VC ) 3 month age infant whose parent receive ( intervention group ) ( control group ) intervention maternity ward recruitment period . STUDY DESIGN This study multicentre randomize control trial ( RCT ) single unit randomization conduct maternity ward 5 province : Quebec ( QC ) , British Columbia ( BC ) , Ontario ( ON ) , Nova Scotia ( NS ) / Prince Edward Island ( PEI ) . In center , parent randomize receive MI intervention ( intervention group ) receive information flyer childhood vaccine ( control group ) . The flyer give mother control group one usually give parent maternity ward first home visit birth first week . Thus , flyer different accord participate region study . Randomization stratify center make block 4 , 6 8 participant . STUDY POPULATION Study participants The study population include 1,600 mother infant bear participate maternity ward recruitment period . Study center The study conduct 6 maternity ward locate 4 different center : 1 . Centre hospitalier universitaire de Sherbrooke ( CHUS ) , Sherbrooke , QC ; 2 . B.C . Women 's Hospital &amp; Health Centre , Vancouver , BC Surrey Memorial Hospital , Surrey , BC ; 3 . North York General Hospital , Toronto , ON ; 4 . IWK Health Centre , Halifax , NS Queen Elizabeth Hospital , Charlottetown , PE . The choice 6 maternity ward best compromise study feasibility diversity Canadian population . More 2,500 delivery per year occur maternity ward ( except Queen Elizabeth Hospital approximately 1200 annual birth ) , ensure feasibility study . CONDUCT OF STUDY Enrollment Each subject must participate informed consent process sign date inform consent form procedure specify protocol perform . Mothers attend participant maternity ward entirely free participate study . Benefits study chance parent discuss childhood immunization non-confronting non-judgemental climate improvement knowledge . Participation study involve risk , besides risk breach confidentiality precaution take . Regulatory consideration The study register ClinicalTrials.gov . Recruitment Mothers approach participate postpartum stay maternity ward . The MI intervention deliver research assistant ( RA ) ( research nurse ) first receive standardized training session content technique MI . Since postpartum stay may last less 24 hour province , RAs recruit mother chronological way accord birth time mother ensure meet high number mother possible . The recruitment conduct 4 6 month . In Quebec RCT , 25 participant recruit average week , feasible recruit 400 participant within 4 6 month . Study plan After mother agree participate , complete initial questionnaire ( Q1 ) ass intention vaccinate , VH score KAB vaccination , well socio-demographics characteristic . RAs collect questionnaire proceed randomization participate mother receive MI intervention receive flyer childhood immunization . Depending randomization result , RAs perform MI intervention parent give information flyer . RAs distribute similar questionnaire ( Q2 ) parent group assess intention vaccinate , VH score KAB vaccination , well satisfaction intervention receive ( MI flyer ) . Before leave maternity ward , parent return complete questionnaire RA designate place . When child 3 month age , online survey ( Q3 ) send participant email ass VH score KAB well child 's vaccine status . Standardization intervention To ensure content information session standardize similar center RA , reference document primary vaccination ( vaccine administer age 1 year ) make accord provincial recommendation center use training RAs . This training conduct 3 day include supervision via audio recording ( 2 day + 1 day ) . First , RAs participate 2-day centralized training seminar Montreal MI technique give certified trainer begin study . Subsequently , RAs practice MI skills 4 6-week trial period respective maternity ward . During time , RAs send online audio record MI intervention mother maternity ward ( separate inform consent form sign mother authorize record sending MI intervention ) . The audio recording securely transfer certified MI trainer web-based application name REDCap ( Research Electronic Data Capture ) . Based recording , certify MI trainer ass MI skill offer support feedback improve practice . After 6 week trial , study coordinator certify MI trainer visit center give individual feedback coaching RA . They observe validate MI intervention perform RAs identify possible barrier implementation study accord maternity ward . This training framework consistent literature since MI train indeed require train 2 step feedback train coach real situation initial training . Data collect 6-week trial period discard since RAs practise conduct study . Data use monitor good clinical practice ( GCPs ) center audit study coordinator . After training , RAs officially start recruitment maternity ward . The MI trainer available answer question offer support RAs regard MI technique throughout study . Confidentiality protection Source document contain name , address contact information participant store local site individual folder , identify assign participant identification number ( PID ) number . These document store locked filing cabinet secure research facility , control access , limited authorized staff investigator . No personal identifier appear summary report study data send coordinate center . STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS Sample size In order identify statistically significant amelioration 8 % parent ' intention vaccinate , take account basic intention vaccinate 78 % , risk alpha error 0.05 power 80 % , total 400 parent center include . This sample size also allow detect minimum 5 % reduction VH score center . The total sample 1,600 family allow detect significant amelioration 6 % infant ' VC . Data analysis A descriptive analysis response Q1 , Q2 Q3 conduct . Q1 Q2 responses well Q1 Q3 response ( KAB , vaccination intention VH score ) compare mother belong intervention group order ass intervention 's effectiveness , globally participate center . Q1 , Q2 Q3 response ( KAB , vaccination intention VH score ) also compare intervention control group order demonstrate MI intervention 's effectiveness compare information flyer . Parents ' intention vaccinate infant measure intervention dichotomize `` certainly '' vs. `` probably '' ; `` probably '' `` certainly '' compare covariates measure intervention . Multivariate logistic regression analysis conduct identify independent determinant influence vaccination intention . Regarding VC , define proportion child complete vaccine status total participate child . A child consider complete vaccine status receive vaccine antigen recommend respective provincial immunization schedule 3 month age . Q1 Q2 response ( KAB , vaccination intention VH score ) first compare use McNemar 's test Wilcoxon 's signed rank test pair data mother belong intervention group . Thereafter , Q1 , Q2 Q3 response ( KAB , vaccination intention VH score ) compare intervention control group use Chi-square test Fisher 's exact test appropriate continuous variable compare use Student 's t-test Mann-Whitney U test appropriate . Moreover , covariates compare vaccination intention use appropriate test mention . In multivariate analysis , collinearity variable include model check model adequacy assess Hosmer-Lemeshow test deviance test . Finally , VC analyze globally , compare proportion properly vaccinate child intervention control group use Chi-square test . The SAS software ( version 9.4 , SAS Institute , Inc. , Cary , NC ) use statistical analysis .</detailed_description>
