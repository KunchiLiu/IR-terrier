	<brief_summary>Prospective open-label , uncontrolled clinical study ass safety efficacy autologous culture epidermal graft contain epidermal stem cell genetically modify aid gamma-retroviral vector carry COL7A1 complementary DNA ( cDNA ) restoration epidermis patient recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa . The purpose study demonstrate safety efficacy one treatments genetically correct culture epidermal autograft ( Hologene 7 ) patient suffer recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa ( RDEB ) COL7A1 mutation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This monocentric , prospective , open label , uncontrolled clinical trial , phase I/II . Patients screen accord Study Inclusion Exclusion criterion candidate treatment inclusion none exclusion criterion meet . After confirmation eligibility , patient undergo biopsy collection autologous epidermal cell use produce tissue treatment . In case criterion meet , transplantation new culture transgenic epidermis plan accord procedure need patient . The study treatment consist surgical intervention new restored stem cell implantation . The surgery carry 2 stage , first aim take biopsy isolate epidermal cell include stem cell . The biopsy process laboratory regenerative medicine manufacturing site correct , expand prepared final sheet implant . Therefore , patient second intervention . In second surgery , genetically correct culture epidermal autograft ( Hologene 7 ) implant select area . The specialist surgeon either use local general anaesthetic implant operation . The treated area immobilized day operation . Antibiotics anti-inflammatory drug administer ( necessary ) prevent infection minimise swell . Three month transplantation , primary endpoint evaluate Investigator . The study completion reach 1 year ( secondary endpoint ) follow-up last transplant last patient accomplish . The end trial define last visit last patient last treatment .</detailed_description>
