	<brief_summary>The aim prospective , observational study determine incidence post-operative residual neuromuscular blockade ( PRNB ) patient undergo intra-abdominal procedure compare patient undergo noncardiac/non intra-thoracic procedure also require non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent ( NMBA ) administration . As intra-abdominal surgery independently associate post-operative pulmonary complication ( PPCs ) , important highlight factor , PRNB , could contribute complications.Although show risk adverse respiratory event reduce intra-operative quantitative neuromuscular monitoring , monitor widespread use.This study incorporate quantitative monitoring post-anesthesia care unit ( PACU ) set use Stimpod NMS450Â® effort show disparity incidence residual paralysis two patient population emphasize need implement accurate neuromuscular monitoring , especially already increase risk respiratory complication .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Incidence Residual Neuromuscular Blockade Intra-abdominal Surgery : A Prospective , Observational Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Residual paralysis non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent ( NMBAs ) common problem contributes adverse outcomes post-anesthesia care unit ( PACU ) .Unidentified residual neuromuscular blockade ( define train-of-four ( TOF ) ratio &lt; 0.9 ) report 30-42 % patient recovery room.Though current literature support use quantitative monitoring neuromuscular blockade , conventional qualitative TOF count monitor clinical sign ( head lift , grip strength ) continue used.There strong evidence show reduction clinically significant post-operative residual neuromuscular blockade ( PRNB ) implementation quantitative monitoring . Post-operative pulmonary complication ( PPCs ) notable adverse outcome residual neuromuscular blockade . The implementation quantitative monitoring may particularly beneficial patient already predispose PPCs secondary site surgery . The purpose study evaluate incidence PRNB use quantitative neuromuscular monitoring patient undergoing intra-abdominal procedure compare patient undergo surgical procedure also require NMBA administration .</detailed_description>
