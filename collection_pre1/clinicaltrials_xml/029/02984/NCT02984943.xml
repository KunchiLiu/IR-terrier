	<brief_title>The Effects Hyperbaric Oxygen Rheumatoid Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) chronic , systemic , inflammatory disorder unknown etiology primarily involve synovial joint , typically symmetrically . If untreated and/or uncontrolled , joint destruction due erosion cartilage bone cause joint destruction , joint deformity , loss physical function , severe disability , difficulty maintain employment.1 ACR/EULAR 2010 classification criteria2 score-based algorithm add score 4 category include , joint involvement , serology , acute-phase reactant duration symptom . A score &gt; 6/10 need classification patient definite RA . Non-pharmacologic supplementary therapy include patient education , rest , exercise , nutrition counseling , cardiovascular disease risk reduction , immunization decrease risk infectious complication immunosuppression . These important comprehensive management RA stag disease use addition drug therapy . Pharmacologic therapies typically start disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug ( DMARD ) , preferably soon possible diagnosis . DMARDs commonly use combination anti-inflammatory drug non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) glucocorticoid often use bridge therapy DMARDs become effective . The goal disease remission . To assess response , disease activity score use along inflammatory marker . Three patient active RA treat multi-place hyperbaric facility DGMC , Travis Air Force Base , CA , non RA-related indication , note significant improvement arthralgia , sleep pattern overall well-being course therapy . Two treat 2 atmosphere absolute ( ATA ) oxygen 90 minute daily Monday Friday . One patient receive 2 ATA air treatment protocol participant research study , subsequent course hyperbaric oxygen ( HBO2 ) 2 ATA . This pilot study . Patients recruited Rheumatologists , flyer Rheumatology Clinic thru Commander Calls . During first visit : The rheumatologist discuss trial point subject consent inclusion/exclusion criterion review . If subject qualifies see Hyperbaric physician physical examination determine safe subject receive HBO2 . After exam do subject schedule trial Hyperbaric session . Baseline visit do subject tolerate trial hyperbaric session . This visit include : 1 . A visit rheumatologist routine assessment establish baseline measurement use Disease Activity Scale ( DAS28 ) 2 . Labs ( CRP ESR ) , complete . MRI without contrast ultrasound do hand wrist proximal phalanx wrist . 3 . Subjective patient reporting capture use Multi-Dimensional Health Assessment Questionnaire ( MDHAQ ) 9 4 . Sleep quality track use Pain Sleep Quality Questionnaire ( PSQ-3 ) 10 . Surveys do study team member , The subject time schedule start 30 HBO2 treatment . Treatments daily , Monday Friday At month 2 , lab ( ESR CRP ) repeat . At month 3 month 6 visit subject see rheumatologist track disease activity use DAS-28 . Labs , MRI Ultrasound do . MDHAQ PSQ-3 administer time . If patient 's RA symptom worsen study , physician institute measure address cause . The medical monitor notified adverse event involve , record report IRB . Data : Data enter authorize study personnel . Demographic information collect include sex , age ethnic background accordance HIPPA compliance . Data collect study analyze various point time include physician exam , lab , radiologic study , joint inspection . Changes joint pain determine self-reporting result standard outcome measure questionnaire . A separate sleep survey administer .</detailed_description>
