	<detailed_description>In addition well-known effect Erythropoietin ( EPO ) erythropoiesis hypoxic condition , line evidence suggest protective effect reperfusion injury several tissue specific receptor . Preclinical study indicate broad variety cardioprotective action EPO . It improve cardiac function exercise capacity congestive heart failure , angiogenesis , limit myocardial inflammatory response , cardiac remodeling , infarct size apoptosis extension induce reperfusion injury . Activation EPO receptor endothelial cardiac cell suggest attenuate proinflammatory cytokine production inflammatory cell infiltration , increase nitric oxide production possible mechanism . Reperfusion injury unavoidable event cardiac surgery use cardiopulmonary bypass.It associate inflammation , cell injury attenuate contractility property . Although area concern many clinical study design different intervention , remain major challenge . EPO intervention heart reperfusion ( surgery/ percutaneous angioplasty ) new promise cardioprotection strategy main design several study conflict result .</detailed_description>
