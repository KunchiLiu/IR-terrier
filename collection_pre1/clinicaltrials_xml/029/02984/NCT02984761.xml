	<brief_summary>Patients stage I non-small cell lung cancer historically treat surgery whenever fit operation . However , alternative treatment know stereotactic radiotherapy appear offer equally effective alternative . Doctors believe good treatment therefore conduct study determine one may possibly better .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Veterans Affairs Lung Cancer Or Stereotactic Radiotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The standard care stage I non-small cell lung cancer historically surgical resection patient medically fit tolerate operation . Recent data suggest stereotactic radiotherapy may suitable alternative . This include result pool analysis two incomplete phase III study report 15 % overall survival advantage stereotactic radiotherapy 3 year . While data promise , median follow-up period short , result underpowered , finding contradiction multiple retrospective study demonstrate outcome surgery likely equal superior . Therefore , herein trial aim evaluate two treatment prospective randomize fashion goal compare overall survival beyond 5 year . It design enroll patient long life-expectancy , fit enough tolerate anatomic pulmonary resection intraoperative lymph node sample . This study design open Veterans Affairs medical center expertise treatment . The recruitment process include share decision make multi-disciplinary evaluation lung cancer specialist . Mandatory evaluation randomization include tissue confirmation NSCLC , stag FDG-PET/CT , biopsies hilar and/or mediastinal lymph node &gt; 10mm SUV &gt; 2.5 . Pre-randomization elective lymph node sample strongly encourage , require . Following treatment , patient follow minimum 5 year .</detailed_description>
