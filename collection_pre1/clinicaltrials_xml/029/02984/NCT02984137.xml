	<brief_title>Prospective Neuroimaging Investigation Idiopathic REM Sleep Behavior Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study include 3 group relation RBD : idiopathic RBD ( iRBD ) , PD- RBD , normal control without RBD . In group , neurological examination , olfactory testing , nonmotor symptom evaluation , neuropsychological evaluation ( detailed outcomes outcome section ) perform baseline evaluation enrollment . Image data obtain follow modality : brain magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , 18F-N-ω-fluoropropyl- 2β-carbomethoxy- 3β- ( 4-iodophenyl ) nortropane ( [ 18F ] FP-CIT ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) , 18F-fludeoxyglucose ( [ 18F ] FDG ) PET . To assess progression toward Lewy body disorder , patient iRBD group evaluate 2 , 4 year follow-up visit . Clinical , neuropsychological test , brain MRI , two PET scan administer . After 4 year , patient willing participate additionally followed-up yearly routine clinical visit clinical neurological examination obvious sign Lewy body diseases develop . In PD-RBD group , patient evaluate 3-year follow-up period amongst day routine clinic visit administer clinical neuropsychological test .</detailed_description>
