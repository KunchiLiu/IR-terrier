These experimental animal model show serotonergic activity hypothalamic level inhibit ejaculation reflex . Based physiological effect , selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) , serotonin agonist increase intravaginal ejaculation latency time ( IELT ) . A number study show exercise increase functional effect serotonin human brain . The effect physical activity level human health attract interest worldwide .
