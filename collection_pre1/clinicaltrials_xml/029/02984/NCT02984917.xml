	<brief_title>Anterior Transversalis Fascia Approach Versus Preperitoneal Space Approach Inguinal Hernia Repair Residents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>History current related study Inguinal hernia common surgical disease manifest protrusion abdominal cavity content inguinal canal abdominal wall defect . It common male female , overall incidence 5-10 % . Methods surgical repair abdominal wall defect inguinal region classify either 'tension'repairs 'tension-free ' repair . Herniorrhaphy repair posterior wall inguinal canal first describe Bassini 1887 , regard classic surgical method . As understanding anatomic location pathophysical characteristic inguinal hernia develop , American surgeon Lichtenstein propose new concept tension-free herniorrhaphy . This technique quickly adopt worldwide advantage include minimal invasion , technical ease , effectiveness , low complication rate , low recurrence rate , allowance resumption unrestricted physical activity . The common technique open tension-free herniorrhaphy . Many surgical repair method involve patch ( vary type material ) available inguinal hernia repair . Tension-free herniorrhaphy method include anterior transversalis fascia repair , preperitoneal repair , abdominal cavity patch repair combine repair approach . Lichtenstein herniorrhaphy representative technique anterior transversalis fascia repair . Preperitoneal repair technique include transabdominal preperitoneal , total extraperitoneal , Kugel repair technique . The combined repair approach refer tension-free herniorrhaphy use modify Kugel patch Ultrapro hernia system . There report effect different inguinal hernia repair approach postoperative complication , particularly regard severe postoperative complication , patient northern China . The incidence severe complication inguinal hernia repair relatively low , surgery lead physical impairment organ dysfunction greatly decrease patient quality life place heavy burden patient 's family society . At present , scarcity clinical evidence large-sample , randomize , control trial investigate effectiveness inguinal hernia repair via anterior transversalis fascia approach versus preperitoneal approach . Adverse event serious adverse event ( SAE ) According study protocol clinical judgment , AE/SAE occur herniorrhaphy report Department General Surgery , Fourth Affiliated Hospital China Medical University . AE refer adverse medical event occur herniorrhaphy patient clinical subject . SAE refer adverse postoperative medical event involve one follow criterion : Death , irrespective cause Life-threatening event Severe permanent disability organ dysfunction Hemorrhage Malformation , birth defect Hospitalization extend hospital stay Re-admission hospital Recurrence ( symptomatic ) inguinal hernia Statistical analysis Descriptive statistic use analyze data . For measurement data , number patient ( number miss patient ) , mean , median , standard deviation , first quartile , third quartile , maximum minimum described , 95 % confidence interval calculate . For count data , frequency relative number describe , 95 % confidence interval calculate . According whether difference score treatment normally distribute , pair t-test Wilcoxon sign rank test use comparison measurement data group . The chi-squared test Fisher 's exact test use analysis count data , Wilcoxon sign rank test use analysis rank data . The last-observation-carried-forward imputation method use effects-related visit data last visit miss . Full analysis set According intention-to-treat principle , patient receive least one treatment accord study protocol undergo least one evaluation regard curative effect baseline evaluation include full analysis set . Curative effect analysis Full analysis set analysis curative effect perform . The proportion patient complication , patient common complication , patient severe complication within postoperative 3 week analyze use descriptive statistic . The chi-squared test Fisher 's exact test use comparison difference group . If statistical difference exist group , Bonferroni method use adjust α value , pairwise comparison make . If change VAS pain score treatment meet normality homogeneity variance , analysis variance perform . If statistical analysis variance result significant , in-depth statistical analysis perform , Bonferroni method use pairwise comparison . Otherwise , Kruskal-Wallis test performed . If statistical result Kruskal-Wallis test significant , in-depth statistical analysis perform , independent Wilcoxon sign rank test performed . The Bonferroni method use adjust P value pairwise comparison . Safety evaluation Safety analysis analysis incidence postoperative complication perform use descriptive statistic . The chi-squared test Fisher 's exact test perform comparison group . If significant difference exist , Bonferroni method use adjust α value , in-depth pairwise comparison make group . Vital sign laboratory outcomes analyze use descriptive statistic . The paired t-test Wilcoxon sign rank test use analyze difference value surgery . Imaging data electrocardiogram analyze use cross tabulation . Economic analysis Cost-utility analysis use economic evaluation , sensitivity analysis cost utility perform . Interim analysis When adequate number patient enrol followed-up , interim analysis perform . When data include full analysis set recorded database , first interim analysis management period perform check whether core data collect suitable preliminary significant data analysis . According research progression , subsequent interim analysis data include database designate . After acquire approval Department General Surgery Scientific Construction Committee , Fourth Affiliated Hospital China Medical University , data collect Department General Surgery , Fourth Affiliated Hospital China Medical University likely analyze together data collect research center . In accordance applicable law regulation , information subject study keep confidential . The data interim analysis precisely describe statistical analysis plan . The interim analysis result submit sponsor project manager form statistical analysis report , slide co-sponsors . Sample size Investigators hypothesize anterior transversalis fascia repair reduce percentage patient postoperative pain 15 % compare percentage patient pain surgery . Taking α = 0.05 power = 80 % , final effective sample size n = 300 calculate . Assuming patient loss rate 20 % , investigator require 360 patient . This study plan perform nine institute investigate effectiveness inguinal hernia repair via anterior transversalis fascia approach versus preperitoneal approach patient northern China . Investigators plan include least 2,000 patient .</detailed_description>
