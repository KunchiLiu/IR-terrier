	<detailed_description>Making wean decision patient mechanical ventilator important clinical issue . It thus important decide accurately patient wean ventilator . To increase wean success , present common practice conduct spontaneous breathing trial get physiological signal may provide information capacity successful weaning . The common index rapid shallow breathe index ( RSBI ) , however , accuracy RSBI predict successful weaning question . Weaning failure usually result complex interplay multiple factor . Thus , predictor target single pathophysiologic mechanism tend unreliable heterogeneous abnormality . The investigator propose new mathematical model algorithm , capture essential feature variability rule physiological dynamic . Through modern adaptive signal processing technique , investigator develop index call WIN , evaluate 5 minute continuous physiological signal provide good perdition wean RSBI retrospective analysis . In study , investigator evaluate predictive power WIN RSBI prospectively patient undergo wean prospectively .</detailed_description>
