	<brief_title>Pituitary Dysfunction After Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The incidence aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage ( aSAH ) vary 6 10/100,000 subject per year major cause death disability . The mortality rate range 40 50 % , survive SAH high rate functional limitation could lead impaired quality life , include fatigue , depression , loss motivation . Because aSAH affect patient productive year life , disease important social , economic implication , early prediction long-term outcome base multiple factor include primary injury secondary insult well neurorehabilitation intervention . Recently , occurrence potential impact pituitary dysfunction aSAH gain increase interest . Several study demonstrate pituitary dysfunction SAH suggest pituitary dysfunction may contribute factor residual symptom SAH . However , question remain real prevalence impact dysfunction patient ' outcome acute chronic phase event . In two recent metanalysis , prevalence total pituitary dysfunction find pooled frequency 0.31 ( 95 % confidence interval CI : 0.22-0.43 ) [ Can et . ] 49.3.0 % ( 95 % CI 41.6 % -56.9 % ) [ Robba et al ] acute phase ( &lt; 6 month aSAH ) decrease chronic phase 0.25 ( 95 % CI : 0.16-0.36 ) [ Can et al . ] 25.6 % ( 95 % CI 18.0 % -35.1 % ) [ Robba et al ] . However , author find high heterogenicity different result available literature ; many difference find choice time pituitary function assessment SAH , diagnostic criterion unit measurement use establish diagnosis hypopituitarism SAH . Finally , clear hormone axis likely affect aSAH . It believe , among , incidence thyroid dysfunction relevant , associate severe clinical impairment symptom . In literature , prevalence thyroid dysfunction aSAH report 0 35 % . [ Karaka , Tanrivedi ] . Hypothyroidism include wide variety symptom include weakness , fatigue , depression , irritability , memory loss decrease libido . Should abnormalities complicate one third patient , hormone test eventually replacement become `` standard care '' test . In order define actual incidence abnormality , observational multicentric study test thyroid abnormality , include TSH , fT4 ( free thyroxine ) fT3 ( free triiodothyronine ) change , warrant . Secondary endpoint study include prevalence neuroendocrinological dysfunction influence patient ' outcome .</detailed_description>
