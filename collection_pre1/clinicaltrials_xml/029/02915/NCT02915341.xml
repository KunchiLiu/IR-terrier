	<brief_summary>The overall objective study extend previous work development method automatically detect time cocaine use cardiac interbeat interval physical activity data derive wearable , unobtrusive mobile sensor technology . The specific objective protocol characterize condition high quality continuous interbeat interval data physical activity data obtain specially developed smartwatch device natural field set among population cocaine user . In addition identify common failure scenario understanding wearability/usage pattern collect interbeat interval smartwatches , study extend previous work detection cocaine use via interbeat interval physical activity data previously obtain wearable chestband sensor . Information study contribute toward adaptation investigator ' exist computational model detect cocaine use via chest sensor , apply interbeat physical activity data obtain less obtrusive smartwatches .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study evaluate smartwatch device continuous field assessment physiological measure , include cardiac interbeat interval physical activity . These measure previously employ use wearable chest sensor develop model automatic in-the-field detection time cocaine use ; computational model use physiological data type use prior research detect cocaine use moment-by-moment stress use mobile sensor suite call AutoSense . AutoSense chest-worn device use collect measure heart rate via two-lead electrocardiograph ( ECG ) physical activity via 3-axis accelerometer transmit wirelessly Android-based smartphone initial processing data storage . The adapted AutoSense protocol incorporate smartwatches specially design continuously detect heart beat timing use optical photoplethysmogram ( PPG ) sensor rather ECG lead . Prior start protocol , investigator optimize collection cardiac interbeat interval data smartwatches via preliminary ambulatory study ( Co-Investigator Ertin Ohio State University ) . The development smartwatch device initial smartwatch computational model currently support separately ( outside human subject protocol ) National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network ( CTN ) . Investigators research assistant Ohio State University wear prototype smartwatch device AutoSense chest sensor waking hour five day capture cardiac interbeat interval data well identify initial fit usability problem prototype smartwatch device inform subsequent refinement . This preliminary ambulatory study separate protocol conduct Ohio State University oversight institution 's Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) , thus consider part 0073-Ot human subject protocol . Once preliminary study conclude , investigator conduct field test smartwatch AutoSense chest sensor wear 25 cocaine user two week ( 5 participant participate pilot test two week , smartwatch device may undergo refinement improve wearability and/or data collection among remain participant ) . Outcomes study characterize feasibility smartwatch device continuously detect interbeat interval physical activity data , characterize situation data yield sufficient quality application advance computational model ( e.g. , cocaine detection ) take place participant ' natural field setting . Secondarily , data trial use compare data yield two sensor suite wear ( smartwatch device AutoSense chest sensor ) . The data may also useful update computational model ( e.g. , cocaine detection ) previously develop AutoSense chest sensor data collect smartwatches . The result study may use inform future research type investigate technological improvement situation use mobile sensor unobtrusively characterize precipitant use pattern ( e.g. , contextual ) surround drug use event . It important note study design assess acceptability smartwatch among cocaine user , study evaluate utility use smartwatch measure cocaine use outcomes part clinical trial . Rather , investigator intentionally recruit participant frequently use cocaine compensate participate study design characterize feasibility use smartwatch collect reliable , continuous interbeat interval physical activity data natural field setting , characterize condition high quality data obtain smartwatches . If result promise , future research design large sample size explore clinically-relevant scientific question .</detailed_description>
