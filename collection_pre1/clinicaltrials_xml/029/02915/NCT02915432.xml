	<brief_title>The Study Evaluate JS001 Patients With Advanced GC , ESCC , NPC , HNSCC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Overall Design : This study phase Ib/II clinical study Recombinant Humanized Anti-Programmed Death Antibody 1 ( PD-1 ) Monoclonal Antibody infusion . It multicenter , open-label clinical study investigate preliminary efficacy safety JS001 4 indication include gastric adenocarcinoma ( GC ) , esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ( ESCC ) , nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ) , head neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) , unique unmet clinical need China . Subjects eligible study fulfill inclusion criterion exclusion criterion . Subjects diagnose gastric adenocarcinoma , esophageal squamous cell carcinoma , nasopharyngeal carcinoma , head neck squamous cell carcinoma receive treatment dose 3 mg/kg . If one certain indication reach predefined study endpoint dose 3 mg/kg , enrollment patient expand 10mg/kg group . Meanwhile , subject safety pharmacokinetic data dose group observe ongoing come phase I study , study may explore dose group determine RP2D relevant indication . To add new dose group ( ) , approval Data Safety Monitoring Committee ( DSMC ) Ethics Committee local study site obtain initiation subject enrollment . Study Treatment : This study plan conduct 3 mg/kg dose group study first . After enrollment , subject administer every 2 week ( Q2W ) 4 week cycle , absence benefit , acceptable toxicity , investigator decision , consent withdrawal death . If patient experience 1st onset disease progression investigator judge patient obtain clinical benefit study treatment , patient continue study treatment discussion investigator medical monitor sponsor authorize CRO approval obtain afterwards . If subject develop 2nd disease progression 1st disease progression , he/she permanently withdraw study treatment . Tumor Assessment : During study , tumor response assessment conduct every 8 week first year accord RECIST 1.1 criterion , every 12 week thereafter . Tumor response assessment also evaluate accord irRC frequency RECIST 1.1 . Pharmacokinetics : At least 10 patient ( limit indication ) 3 mg/kg dose group assign study site , complete serial pharmacokinetic blood sample first 3 cycle . If subject complete schedule sample collection due cause , another subject substitute . The schedule pharmacokinetic blood sampling refer Appendix 2 . If dose group open study , least 10 subject dose group participate serial pharmacokinetic blood sampling . Acquisition Tumor Tissue Specimen : Patients esophageal squamous cell carcinoma , gastric adenocarcinoma ( include adenocarcinoma esophageal-gastric conjunction ) head neck squamous cell carcinoma must provide tumor tissue specimens prior enrollment detect expression PD-L1 . Only patient positive PD-L1 expression eligible study . Subjects nasopharyngeal carcinoma must provide tumor tissue specimens prior enrollment future use subsequent exploratory research . If response verify partial response ( PR ) and/or progression disease ( PD ) subject nasopharyngeal carcinoma group head neck squamous cell carcinoma group tumor tissue could obtain , subject voluntarily participate subgroup study study . They provide tumor tissue exploratory research correlation tumor marker anti-tumor response level . All tumor tissue specimens provide sent designate central laboratory evaluation End Study : The primary endpoint study ORR . The study complete 12 month last subject first dosing data analysis conduct time . If still subject receive treatment study drug , subject transfer expansion study continue treatment study drug occurrence clinical benefit , unacceptable toxicity , investigator decide end treatment , withdrawal inform consent death .</detailed_description>
