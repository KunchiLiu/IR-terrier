Participants exclude intoxicated time trauma , seem cognitively impaired suffer severe head injury . After stratify 1:1 randomization either AEPET plus RBT ( n=10-15 ) RBT alone ( n=10-15 ) , consent participant complete baseline measure 3 therapy session , start within 1 week post-trauma . Participants schedule first 30-60 minute therapy session consent . Participants receive two face-to-face / telephone session close together possible , follow complete three questionnaire second session .

The anticipated outcome include low level PTSD depressive symptom AEPET + RBT vs. RBT alone self report semi structure interview 4-6 week . Significance : In test feasibility effectiveness AEPET novel treatment prevention PTSD within trauma ward , Sunnybrook Hospital would potentially pioneer feasible cost-effective method employ quick response , target treatment mitigate symptom PTSD depression trauma .</detailed_description>
