	<brief_summary>The inclusion criterion patient age 18 old ankylosing spondylitis , fulfilled 1984 modify New York criterion AS . Inclusion criterion enrich AS patient clinical remission , include follow definition : 1 . Administration etanercept 50 mg 6-week period least ; 2 . Acquisition Assessment SpondyloArthritis International Society criterion 20 ( ASAS20 ) response end treatment . We exclude patient develop complete spinal fusion . We also exclude patient kidney disease induced condition ; pregnancy ; suckle ; accompany chronic disease ; various infection acute stage ; infectious disease . At end trial , patient fulfil inclusion would stop etanercept treatment . Cotherapy disease modify anti-rheumatic drug non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug could continue maintain stable dose ; Patients follow time etanercept withdrawal per 6 week 3 year telephone . If symptom suggestive relapse problem occur , patient invite come back center . Relapse etanercept withdrawal define increase Bath Spondylitis Disease Activity Index ( BASDAI ) 15 score go back 80 percentage begin trial16 . The following data collect : demographic disease characteristic , therapeutic modification , clinical value ( BASFI , Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Global Score ( BAS-G ) ) , Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score ( ASDAS ) 1718 ) biologic value baseline trial time relapse . Adverse event safety measure also collect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Relapse Ankylosing Spondylitis Patients Withdrawal Etanercept After Clinical Remission : Following-up Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients follow 6 week telephone . The sample size least 30 people . If symptom suggestive relapse problem occur , patient invite come back center . Relapse etanercept withdrawal define increase Bath Spondylitis Disease Activity Index ( BASDAI ) score go back 80 percentage begin trial16 . The following data collect : demographic disease characteristic , therapeutic modification , clinical value ( BASFI , Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Global Score ( BAS-G ) ) , Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score ( ASDAS ) biologic value baseline trial time relapse . Adverse event safety measure also collect . Demographic baseline disease characteristic summarize descriptive statistic analyse one-way ANOVA continuous continuous variable χ2 test categorical variable . The Kaplan-Meier method use estimate time-to-relapse rate etanercept withdrawal . Time-to-relapse curve compare group patient receive 12-week 6-week treatment etanercept log-rank test . The influence follow variable include age，duration disease , onset age , BASDAI , ASDAS-CRP , C reaction protein ( CRP ) , erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( ESR ) examine use Cox proportional hazard model evaluate etanercept withdrawal time-to-relapse . Every continuous variable divide 3 category approximately 33 % 67 % first19 . If relative relapse rate significantly different 2 contiguous category , gather together . If clear difference observe 3 category , median use cut-off point . Normal value 6 mg/L CRP level test . The proportional hazard model use study effect factor time-to-relapse identify independent prognostic factor . Relapse rate present estimate standard error ( SE ) , follow-up time median ( interquartile range ) , hazard ratio estimate 95 % confidence interval . All analysis perform use SPSS software v16.0 ( SPSS , Inc , Chicago , IL ) .</detailed_description>
