	<brief_title>A Study Etirinotecan Pegol ( NKTR-102 ) Versus Treatment Physician 's Choice ( TPC ) Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer Who Have Stable Brain Metastases Have Been Previously Treated With Anthracycline , Taxane , Capecitabine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , randomize , active comparator , multicenter , international Phase 3 study NKTR-102 versus TPC patient metastatic breast cancer stable brain metastasis previously treat anthracycline , taxane , capecitabine either adjuvant metastatic setting ( prior anthracycline may omit medically appropriate contraindicate patient ) . In Group A , NKTR-102 administer dose level 145 mg/m2 q21d schedule 90-minute intravenous ( IV ) infusion Day 1 treatment cycle . In Group B , TPC administer per standard care . Patients randomized TPC receive single-agent IV chemotherapy , limited choice one follow 7 agent : eribulin , ixabepilone , vinorelbine , gemcitabine , paclitaxel , docetaxel , nab-paclitaxel . This study randomize approximately 350 patient use 1:1 randomization ratio stratification base geographic region , tumor receptor status , Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) status . At Screening , Investigator must determine TPC offer patient . Data collect subsequent anticancer therapy treatment group time patient come study treatment time primary data analysis OS . An independent data monitoring committee ( DMC ) ass interim safety efficacy data .</detailed_description>
