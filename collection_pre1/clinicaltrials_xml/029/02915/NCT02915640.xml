	<brief_title>Use Mobile Remote Device Optimize Pediatric Inter-facility Transportation : A Feasibility Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Paediatric Specialized Inter-facility transport utilize specialized team usually make respiratory therapist , paediatric critical care nurse , paediatric intensivist medical control . When Nurse Practitioner General Practitioner remote site paediatric acute care referral want arrange transportation initial call point two priority : first obtain patient history provide advice remote caregiver initiate specific therapy ; second mobilize specialized team patient . The period time give initial advice dispatch team time team arrives , often vulnerable period remote caregiver well patient . The ability directly visualize ass patient time , well assist specialized team arrive may provide improvement safety care patient . It may also improve triaging may make stabilization departure time efficient . Remote technology use initial patient assessment contact phone peripheral centre transfer acutely ill paediatric patient assess referral centre care provider . After assessment patient triaged either remain local community , transfer regional hospital provide paediatric acute care ( Prince Albert ) , transport Royal University Hospital Saskatoon tertiary care . Data collect include : - Duration time begin initial phone call first therapeutic intervention - Time stabilization - Time decision disposition - The duration contact health care provider patient - Number schedule follow-up contact specific patient within 24 hour - Number time refer centre re-consults - Of patient triaged stay local community many transport tertiary care centre within 24hrs - How many patient arrive tertiary care centre discharge within 24hrs - How many patient arrival deem unnecessary The nurse physician communicate Intensivist case complete post-encounter survey evaluate experience .</detailed_description>
