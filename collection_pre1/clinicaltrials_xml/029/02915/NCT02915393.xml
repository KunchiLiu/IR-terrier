	<brief_summary>Spleen Deficiency Syndrome ( SDS ) widely research issue , due limitation research method , scientific mechanism SDS bias comprehensive . SDS would research project deeply systematically modern life-scientific method . Based previous work , participant , SDS , suffer Qi deficiency syndrome -- chronic superficial gastritis -- chronic atrophic gastritis -- gastric cancer would include , correspond research would conduct molecular-cell-gastric tissue level , time , systematical biological database SDS would build systematical biological method , pioneer SPARS sequence technology create research group , proteomics metabonomics . Under work , investigator would conduct data mine molecular network analysis , verify key function . By analyze systematical biological feature syndrome relationship constitution disease , study would provide new basis objective reality syndrome , also offer crucial premise reveal biological basis syndrome correctly , important theoretical practical significance .</brief_summary>
