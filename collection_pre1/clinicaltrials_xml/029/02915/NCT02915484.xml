	<brief_title>Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation ( tDCS ) Chronic Post-Stroke Apathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Post-stroke apathy condition people show reduced emotion reduce activity stroke , beyond expect degree weakness . It occur , without , depression , associate disability slow recovery . It think due dysfunction front brain ( prefrontal cortex ) . Importantly , proven medical treatment post-stroke apathy . Transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) painless , noninvasive brain stimulation technique potential alleviate post-stroke apathy . TDCS involve send weak electrical current head , thereby excite brain underneath . This offer potential advantage medication tDCS directly target brain , medication need travel bloodstream reach brain . TDCS FDA-approved treatment condition , previous trial show may benefit movement language recovery stroke , well improve think ability . Studies show tDCS safe serious adverse event 10,000 subject study . This pilot study involve three visit Stony Brook University Hospital . The first baseline session subject perform outcome measure tDCS perform familiarization . The second third session stimulation session subject undergo intervention 20 minute test tDCS effect outcome measure . The effect tDCS single session expect last hour . Subjects receive one type stimulation one session another type session . If study find short term benefit tDCS post-stroke apathy support full clinical trial multiple session tDCS give may provide long-term benefit .</detailed_description>
