	<brief_summary>The aim study describe safety immunogenicity 0.5-mL dose ( 15 μg HA per strain ) Fluzone Quadrivalent vaccine child 6 35 month age . Primary objective : - To compare rate fever ( temperature ≥ 100.4°F [ 38.0°C ] ) follow 0.5-mL dose Fluzone Quadrivalent vaccine follow 0.25 mL dose Fluzone Quadrivalent vaccine 7 day either vaccination ( Dose 1 Dose 2 combine ) subject 6 &lt; 36 month age . Secondary objective : - To compare antibody response induce 0.5-mL dose Fluzone Quadrivalent vaccine induce 0.25-mL dose Fluzone Quadrivalent vaccine assess geometric mean titer ( GMT ) ratios seroconversion rate difference final vaccination subject 6 &lt; 36 month age . Other objective : - To describe safety 2 different dose level 2016-2017 formulation Fluzone Quadrivalent vaccine subject 6 &lt; 36 month age . - To describe immunogenicity 2 different dosage 2016-2017 formulation Fluzone Quadrivalent vaccine subject 6 month &lt; 36 month age . - To submit available serum approximately 30 subject Center Biologics Evaluation Research analysis World Health Organization , Centers Disease Control Prevention , FDA support formulation recommendation subsequent influenza vaccine .</brief_summary>
