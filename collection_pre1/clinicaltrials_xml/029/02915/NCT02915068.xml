	<detailed_description>Failure clinician-patient communication , lack clarity regard clinical treatment priority , recently , ineffective use health IT system exam room associate deficit achieve chronic disease management goal , increase healthcare utilization cost . Strategies communicate patient exam room presence electronic health record ( EHR ) describe literature . Whether strategy reach clinician demonstrate positive health outcome unclear . The investigator propose develop test feasibility patient outcomes interactive training module teach clinicians best practice communicate patient presence computer system exam room ( specifically EHRs ) . They propose modify expand internationally-recognized evidence-based Physician Asthma Care Education ( PACE ) program make suitable tool training primary care clinician effective use EHRs point care . The PACE program base concept skill strengthen communication patient-clinician relationship behavior change principle highly applicable patient asthma potential specific application EHR use clinical practice . The investigator first develop EHR edition PACE ( EHR-PACE ) literature expert review best practice clinician interact patient presence computer system exam room . They establish feasibility potential impact EHR-PACE via randomize design 125 patient 20 physician receive intervention follow outcome via survey 3 6 month post-intervention : patient satisfaction physician 's performance , asthma control , asthma-related quality life . Outcomes assess patient , physician receive intervention.Patients know arm doctor randomize to.The pilot trial compare two group primary care physician see patient asthma clinic equip certified EHRs . It hypothesize patient physician receive EHR-PACE training achieve good outcome compare physician receive EHR-PACE . EHR-PACE develop study expect high degree relevance improve patient-provider communication skill clinician see wide range patient variety practice setting integrate EHRs . Given PACE achieve dramatic outcome within two , 2-hour session , EHR-PACE potential become invaluable train tool busy clinician prove feasible effective . Ultimately , work potential high degree impact .</detailed_description>
