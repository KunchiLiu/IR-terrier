	<criteria>Males female age ≥18 year time inform consent form ( ICF ) Participants histologically confirm non clear cell renal cell carcinoma ( nccRCC ) receive chemotherapy advanced disease . Participants must one follow subtypes nccRCC : papillary , chromophobe , collect duct carcinoma ( CDC ) , renal medullary carcinoma ( RMC ) , unclassified . Radiologically measurable disease meeting follow criterion : At least 1 lesion ≥10 millimeter ( mm ) long diameter nonlymph node ≥15 mm short axis diameter lymph node serially measurable accord Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) v1.1 use computerized tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) ; Lesions external beam radiotherapy ( EBRT ) locoregional therapy radiofrequency ( RF ) ablation must show evidence subsequent progressive disease ( substantial size increase ≥20 % ) deem target lesion . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 1 . Blood pressure ( BP ) ≤140/90 millimeter mercury ( mmHg ) Screening without antihypertensive medication change antihypertensive medication within 1 week prior Cycle 1/Day 1 . Adequate renal function evidence calculated creatinine clearance ≥30 milliliter ( mL ) /minute accord Cockcroft Gault formula Adequate bone marrow function : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥1.5 × 10^9/liter ( L ) ; Hemoglobin ≥10.0 gram per deciliter ( g/dL ) ( correct growth factor transfusion prior first dose study drug ) ; Platelet count ≥100 × 10^9/L Adequate liver function : Bilirubin ≤1.5 × upper limit normal ( ULN ) except unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia Gilbert 's syndrome ; Alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ≤3 × ULN ( ≤5 × ULN participant liver metastasis ) . If ALP &gt; 3 × ULN ( absence liver metastasis ) &gt; 5 × ULN ( presence liver metastasis ) AND participant also know bone metastasis , liverspecific ALP must separate total use ass liver function instead total ALP . Voluntary agreement provide write informed consent willingness ability comply aspects protocol Predominant clear cell renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) Prior anticancer chemotherapy target therapy advanced nccRCC Prior exposure lenvatinib mammalian target rapamycin ( mTOR ) inhibitor Known intolerance lenvatinib , everolimus ( rapamycin derivative ) , excipients Major surgery perform within 3 week prior first dose study drug schedule major surgery study Gastrointestinal malabsorption , gastrointestinal anastomosis , condition might affect absorption lenvatinib everolimus Participants &gt; 1+ proteinuria urine dipstick test undergo 24 hour urine collection quantitative assessment proteinuria . Participants urine protein ≥1 gram ( g ) /24 hour ineligible . Fasting total cholesterol ˃300 milligram ( mg ) /dL ( ˃7.75 millimoles [ mmol ] /L ) fast triglyceride level ˃2.5 × ULN . Note : participant include initiation adjustment lipidlowering medication . Uncontrolled diabetes define fast glucose &gt; 1.5 time ULN . Note : In case threshold exceed , participant include initiation adjustment glucoselowering medication . Known history , evidence , interstitial lung disease active noninfectious pneumonitis . Significant cardiovascular impairment : history ( ) congestive heart failure great New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class II ; ( b ) unstable angina ; ( c ) myocardial infarction ; ( ) stroke ; ( e ) cardiac arrhythmia associate hemodynamic instability within 6 month first dose study drug Prolongation QTcF interval &gt; 480 millisecond ( msec ) Known history human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) positive Known active hepatitis B ( e.g. , hepatitis B surface antigen [ HBsAg ] reactive ) hepatitis C ( e.g. , hepatitis C virus [ HCV ] RNA detect ) Clinically significant hemoptysis tumor bleed within 2 week prior first dose study drug Participants central nervous system ( CNS ) ( e.g. , brain leptomeningeal ) metastasis . Other active malignancy ( except definitively treat melanoma insitu , basal squamous cell carcinoma skin , carcinoma insitu cervix bladder ) within past 24 month Females breastfeed pregnant Screening Baseline ( document positive betahuman chorionic gonadotropin [ βhCG ] human chorionic gonadotropin [ hCG ] test minimum sensitivity 25 International Units [ IU ] /L equivalent unit βhCG hCG ) . A separate baseline assessment require negative screening pregnancy test obtain 72 hour first dose study drug . Females childbearing potential : Had unprotected sexual intercourse within 30 day study entry agree use highly effective method contraception ( e.g. , total abstinence , intrauterine device , doublebarrier method [ condom plus diaphragm spermicide ] , contraceptive implant , oral contraceptive , vasectomized partner confirm azoospermia ) throughout entire study period 28 day study drug discontinuation Are currently abstinent , agree use doublebarrier method ( describe ) refrain sexually active study period 28 day study drug discontinuation Are use hormonal contraceptive stable dose hormonal contraceptive product least 4 week dose agree use contraceptive study 28 day study drug discontinuation Are use oral hormonal contraceptive agree add barrier method Note : All female consider childbearing potential unless postmenopausal ( amenorrheic least 12 consecutive month , appropriate age group , without know suspected cause ) sterilize surgically ( i.e. , bilateral tubal ligation , total hysterectomy , bilateral oophorectomy , surgery least 1 month dose ) . Males successful vasectomy ( confirm azoospermia ) female partner meet criterion ( i.e. , childbearing potential practicing highly effective contraception throughout study period 28 day study drug discontinuation ) . No sperm donation allow study period 28 day study drug discontinuation . Evidence clinically significant disease ( e.g. , cardiovascular , respiratory , gastrointestinal , renal , infectious disease ) opinion investigator ( ) could affect participant 's safety interfere study assessment Any medical condition opinion investigator ( ) would preclude participant 's participation clinical study Active current use illegal recreational drug Currently enrol another interventional clinical study use investigational drug device within past 28 day precede informed consent</criteria>
