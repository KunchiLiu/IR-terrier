	<detailed_description>The purpose study evaluate safety , tolerability , immune response DNA-HIV-PT123 vaccine use combination one two protein vaccine : Bivalent Subtype C gp120/MF59 ( Protein/MF59 ) Bivalent Subtype C gp120/AS01B ( Protein/AS01B ) . These protein vaccine may boost immune response DNA vaccine . The study enroll healthy , HIV-uninfected adult . Participants randomly assign one eight group , group receive different sequence vaccine study . Groups 1 4 receive DNA-HIV-PT123 vaccine , Protein/MF59 vaccine , placebo . Groups 2 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 receive DNA-HIV-PT123 vaccine , Protein/AS01B vaccine , placebo . Group 8 receive placebo . All participant receive assign vaccine Months 0 , 1 , 3 , 6 . Each visit include three injection . Follow-up visit occur Week 2 Months 1.5 , 3.5 , 6.25 , 6.5 , 9 , 12 . Study visit include physical examination , interview and/or questionnaire , HIV test HIV risk reduction counseling , urine blood collection . Participants may optionally choose provide stool , rectal fluid , cervical fluid , semen sample .
