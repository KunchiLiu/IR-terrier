	<brief_summary>Objective : This study examine effect elastic tape apply neck patient experience chronic neck pain . Background : Neck pain often persistent recurrent . Various treatment describe , include exercise manual therapy . Taping commonly use clinically management neck pain , however research field sparse . Methods : Elastic tape apply posterior cervical extensor muscle insertion origin patient experience chronic neck pain . Patients assess pre-taping , immediately post-taping , one week post-taping receive additional physiotherapy study . Subjective measure include Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) pain intensity , Neck Disability Index ( NDI ) determine level disability daily living , Tampa Scale Kinesiophobia ( TSK ) ass fear movement re-injury . Objective outcome measure include cervical range motion , velocity , smoothness , accuracy cervical motion . These kinematic measure collect use customise virtual reality system design evaluate neck motion disorder .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Cervical Taping Neck Pain Kinematics Patients With Chronic Neck Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neck pain common disorder , affect 30-50 % general population annually , comprise approximately 25 % patient receive physiotherapy outpatient clinic . Symptoms include pain stiffness neck , headache , dizziness , pain radiate shoulder upper limb . Physical impairment associate neck pain include decreased cervical range motion ( ROM ) , increased fatigability , compromise strength endurance cervical muscle , impaired sensorimotor control . A variety Physiotherapeutic intervention describe treatment neck pain . Taping passive technique , widely use treatment sport injury , muscle imbalance , impaired neural control . Clinically , tap use neck pain spite lack research regard effectiveness . In addition , mechanism elastic tape application affect tissue function yet unknown , various effect describe ability increase ROM , facilitate muscle proprioception , decrease pain . A literature search retrieve 3 relevant study examine use efficacy elastic tape cervical spine . Gonzalez-Iglesias et al . ( 2009 ) conduct randomized trial whiplash patient , Karatas et al . ( 2012 ) study effect tap surgeon cervical pain performing surgery , Saavedra-Hernandez et al ( 2012 ) - patient mechanical neck pain . All three study demonstrate short-term effectiveness elastic tap pain relief cervical ROM . However , sample small , mostly young participant , effect size described . Reported change small imply research need . The objective study evaluate short-term effect cervical elastic tap pain intensity , disability neck kinematics patient chronic neck pain . Materials Methods This study non-controlled trial pre-post test design single intervention group . Ethics approval obtain ethic committee , Faculty Social welfare Health Sciences University Haifa , Helsinki committee Rambam Health Care Campus Helsinki Committee . Participants A convenience sample 27 individual , 13 male 14 female , recruit via electronic medium . Inclusion criterion ( ) chronic neck pain ( &gt; 3 month ) , without referral upper limb ; ( b ) age 18 year ; ( c ) pain intensity≥ 30 % Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) . Subjects exclude physiotherapy previous 2 month , know skin allergy tape , evidence active vestibular disorder , medical condition may affect performance Rheumatic Arthritis , Diabetes Mellitus , neurological disorder , head injury , low limb pathology , local systemic infection , inability communicate provide inform consent , unstable fracture/dislocation , post-orthopaedic surgery upper body spine , pregnancy . Following screening , participant sign consent form . Virtual Reality Assessment A neck virtual reality ( VR ) system use assess cervical motion kinematics protocol Sarig-Bahat et al . ( 2010 ) . This system include off-the-shelf hardware customize software . Hardware include head-mounted display built-in tracker . Virtual environment software develop use Unity-pro software , version 3.40f520 . Cervical motion elicit interaction image video game display two monitor embed HMD . All dynamic motion data record VR session analyse software real-time . During game , participant act pilot fly airplane . The position airplane control participant 's head motion . Yellow target display HMD monitor participant contact within 5 second align airplane virtual target . Once target contact , new target would appear random location player 's task move towards . Based principle , VR assessment include ( ) evaluate cervical ROM , ( b ) cervical motion velocity , ( c ) cervical motion accuracy smooth head pursuit task . Taping Technique Kinesio®Tex Tape 23 use study . Two strip tape apply : The first layer Y-shaped strip 2 tail 2 side cervical vertebra , place posterior cervical extensor muscle apply insertion origin . The second strip I-shaped approximately 20cm long , transversally apply C5-C7 vertebra tension-on-base technique space correction technique . Study Procedure Patients screen inclusion exclusion criterion . The physiotherapist perform assessment tap technique qualify physiotherapist 13 year clinical experience musculoskeletal physiotherapy qualify Kinesio® tap practitioner . Each patient assess 3 time : pre- 20 minute post-taping day 1 , follow-up assessment 7 day later . Following subjective examination completion questionnaire , explanatory VR session provide minimize training effect reach stable level VR control . Patients evaluate upright sit position , trunk strap back rigid chair eliminate thoracic motion . Calibration perform session participant , instructed manufacturer . Each VR evaluation take 15 minute . Breaks provide need . Following assessment , tape apply . After washout period 20 minute post-taping application , second examination perform . No physiotherapy procedures provide . Patients instruct maintain elastic tape 5 day . They instruct remove tape symptom aggravate topical irritation appear . The third examination one-week initial examination include VR assessment without tape application . A paired-samples t-test use evaluate pre-post difference study outcome measure . Two paired-sample t-tests run : pre- vs. immediate post- , pre- vs. one week post-taping . Significance level set 5 % . Cohen 's calculated determine effect size . Data analyze use SPSS software , version 17 .</detailed_description>
