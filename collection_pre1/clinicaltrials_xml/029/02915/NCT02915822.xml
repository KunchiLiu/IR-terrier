	<detailed_description>This study assess feasibility prospective trial would randomise patient two group surgical correction Hallux Valgus - Open Scarf/Akin osteotomy Minimally Invasive Chevron/Akin osteotomy . Patients complete validated questionnaire ( Manchester Oxford Foot questionnaire ) preoperatively post operatively 6 month 1 year . Range motion Great Toe Metatarsal Phalangeal Joint also measure goniometer . This study assess ability recruit retain patient thus determine study compare surgical technique would feasible . In addition , data collect statistical difference change patient report outcomes , range motion two group calculate significance level p &lt; 0.05 . This study assess large study compare minimally invasive open Hallux Valgus correction would able perform</detailed_description>
