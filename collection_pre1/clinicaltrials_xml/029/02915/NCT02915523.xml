	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine biologically active dose entinostat , give combination avelumab , safe warrant investigation . Additionally , study evaluate effectiveness entinostat combination avelumab determine dose term progression free survival compare avelumab plus placebo patient refractory recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 1b/2 Study Avelumab With Without Entinostat Patients With Advanced Epithelial Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study comprise 2 phase : open-label Safety Lead-in ( Phase 1b ) follow Expansion Phase ( Phase 2 ) . The Expansion Phase evaluate efficacy safety entinostat avelumab administer Recommended Phase 2 Dose ( RP2D ) versus avelumab alone patient advanced epithelial ovarian cancer randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled setting . In Phase 2 , patient randomize 2:1 ratio receive avelumab plus entinostat avelumab plus placebo , respectively . All patient assess Screening specify time conduct study use standard clinical laboratory assessment . Patients assessed response radiological assessment . Patients continue receive appropriate cycle study treatment tumor progression adverse event ( AEs ) occur necessitate discontinuing therapy determine Investigator .</detailed_description>

Nonepithelial ovarian carcinoma ovarian tumor low malignant potential ( i.e. , borderline tumor ) Another know malignancy progress require active treatment ( exclude adequately treat basal cell carcinoma cervical intraepithelial neoplasia/cervical carcinoma situ melanoma situ ) . Prior history cancer allow , long active disease within prior 5 year . Diagnosis immunodeficiency receive systemic steroid therapy form immunosuppressive therapy within 7 day prior enrollment . Active autoimmune disease might deteriorate receive immunostimulatory agent Previously treat histone deacetylase inhibitor ( i.e. , vorinostat , belinostat , romidepsin , panobinostat ) , PD1/PDL1blocking antibody ( i.e. , atezolizumab , nivolumab , pembrolizumab ) , cytotoxic Tlymphocyte associate protein4 ( CTLA4 ) agent Currently enrol ( complete ) another investigational drug study within 30 day prior study drug administration A medical condition precludes adequate study treatment increase patient risk</criteria>
