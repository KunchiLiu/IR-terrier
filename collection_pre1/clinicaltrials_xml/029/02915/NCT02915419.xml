	<brief_title>Evaluation Survival Mature Second Premolar Treated With Regenerative Techniques</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>American Dental Association adopt tissue engineering concept pulp regeneration 2009 . Regeneration focus treatment immature necrotic teeth allow root completion , improve functionality durability affect tooth . Utilizing blood clot affect tooth immature root beneficial , act scaffold migration stem cell morphogens allow regeneration . Based success pulp regeneration treat immature teeth , ambitious dentist start look forward regenerate pulp mature teeth substitution conventional root canal treatment . On hand , lot clinician doubtful treating mature teeth protocol , small apical foramen might provide good portal entry stem cell growth factor , turn important success pulp regeneration.Doubts treat mature apex encourage researcher look alternative stem cell apical papilla , concept idea use alternative source stem cell growth factor platelet rich plasma ( PRP ) emerge . The use platelet rich plasma ( PRP ) potentially ideal scaffold regenerative endodontic therapy report treatment immature teeth . However , use bovine thrombin activation PRP issue controversy , require non autologous anticoagulant know hinder process pulp regeneration . This lead development second generation , platelet concentrate know Choukroun 's platelet rich fibrin ( PRF ) totally autologous nature . Platelet rich fibrin ( PRF ) promising , debatable whether use PRP PRF.The objective study evaluate novel regenerative technique , utilize platelet rich plasma platelet rich fibrin treatment second premolar teeth necrotic pulp , mature apex , periapical lesion . This trial prolong survival affect tooth , aid complete heal periapical lesion , regain pulp vitality sensitivity .</detailed_description>
