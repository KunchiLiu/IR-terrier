We know important chromophore treat atopic eczema ; phototherapy think work improve epidermal barrier function , beneficial effect skin microbiome local immunosuppression . It seem plausible several chromophore ( molecule absorb ultraviolet photon set chain effect aim ) 'targetting ' several chromophore different waveband help . For severe eczema respond adequately narrowband UVB ultraviolet A1 alone combination sometimes used centre UVA1 available .
