	<brief_summary>A substantial proportion individual leave poor residual functioning affect arm stroke . This tremendous impact quality life ability stroke survivor live independently . While exercise consider essential rehabilitation program , benefit generally far optimal lack proper dose term intensity . One way tackle problem develop good tool could predict individual 's potential adjust intensity exercise accordingly . One predict tool exists consist use non-invasive brain stimulation transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) , assess integrity descend motor pathway originate brain . TMS consist apply magnetic wand near scalp stimulate brain cell without induce pain discomfort . One goal current proposal use TMS test integrity motor pathway chronic stroke survivor . The level responses TMS use classify participant term potential recovery , determine optimal level exercise . The study also examine effect another non-invasive brain stimulation technique call transcranial Direct-Current Stimulation—tDCS determine whether enhance response strength training exercise affect arm . Half participant trained tDCS , half trained stimulator . The training program last 4 week ; 3X/week . Both clinical neurophysiological measure perform determine impact strength train intervention participant . Overall , propose project expect positive significant impact stroke survivor ' quality life .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The functional impact impairment UL follow stroke critical give close association residual strength affect UL performance activity post-stroke . Exercise key element recovery , even chronic stroke survivor . However , response exercise quite variable individual , reflect fact exercise intervention often base stroke survivor ' clinical score oppose potential recovery . Accordingly , client comparable clinical presentation often receive similar intervention , even though may exhibit different potential recovery . Hence , use suitable prognostic tool post-stroke recovery individualize intervention base individual potential recovery essential . One tool non-invasive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) . TMS elicit motor evoked potential ( MEP ) , turn provide measure conveniently assess integrity corticospinal pathway . MEP currently recognize good prognosis post-stroke potential recovery . Another factor improve response exercise modulate excitability sensorimotor circuit brain use transcranial Direct-Current Stimulation ( tDCS ) . Studies show prim motor cortex tDCS intervention promote motor recovery stroke patient . Goals : 1 ) To assess MEP amplitude stratification , use guide exercise prescription , optimize UL function chronic stroke survivor ; 2 ) To evaluate whether add tDCS individualized exercise intervention improve UL function . Methods : Participants stratify base MEPs amplitude affect hand . Within stratum , participant randomize two tDCS group : tDCS real tDCS sham . The strength training program target affect upper limb last 4 week ( 3 times/week ) .The tDCS apply anodal montage training session ( 12 session ; 2 mA ) 20 minute ( tDCS real group ) 30 second ( tDCS sham group ) .</detailed_description>
