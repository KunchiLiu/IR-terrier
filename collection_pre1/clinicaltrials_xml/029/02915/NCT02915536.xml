	<brief_summary>With implementation Universal Salt Iodization ( USI ) 1995 , China successfully combat Iodine Deficiency Diseases ( IDD ) . However , China country complicate iodine geographical environment wide natural variation iodine content drinking water . It report water iodine least 11 province city China high , nearly 31 million people exposed risk excessive iodine intake . This raise new public health concern safe upper level iodine intake establish ensure people avoid ingest excessive iodine intake continue implement USI control IDD . The investigator successfully explore tolerable upper intake level ( UL ) iodine Chinese adult conduct randomize double-blinded trial 256 euthyroid volunteer . However , due limit data safe upper intake level iodine child worldwide , current ULs iodine child extrapolate adult base body weight body surface area . As impossible ethically conduct randomized clinical trial regard excessive iodine intake child , investigator plan observational study investigate child live different drinking water iodine level 5 year , observe change thyroid function response iodine exposure level . Subtle change thyroid function thyroid volume child correspond different iodine intake level determine , contribute establishment UL iodine child . The aim : 1 . To establish tolerable upper intake level ( UL ) iodine child China . 2 . To define adverse effect excess iodine child . 3 . To monitor iodine status child live high water iodine area China .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The project design cross-sectional comparative epidemiological study , conduct area high water iodine adequate iodine intake , respectively . The research include follow three stage . First stage : In initial contact phase study , workshop subject matter hold Shandong province . Regions sample accord monitoring data water iodine collect Shandong Institute Endemic Disease Control Research , collaborative department study , well pre-investigation . Areas Shandong water iodine range 150μg/L 800μg/L iodine , correspond urinary iodine excretion ( UIE ) 300-800μg/L , investigate high iodine intake area ( HI ) ; region vary water iodine level within range include . Matching area Shandong 10-100μg/L iodine water , correspond UIE 100-299μg/L , select comparison area adequate iodine intake ( AI ) . Refresher course give investigator capacity laboratory staff update . All relevant local authority properly contact . Pre-investigations conducted determine water iodine level former iodine status resident , help investigator select suitable study area . A pilot study conduct small number subject , include 24h urine collection 3d dietary record ensure method appropriate feasible . Second stage : A cross-sectional study iodine intake thyroid function 7-14-yr-old child carry . This stage mainly include two part . In Part 1 , 24-h spot urinary sample ( 2 time ) child collect precisely evaluate daily iodine intake subject . Spot urinary sample take collection 24-h urine sample . Teachers parent train help child perform collection . 3d dietary record use collect information food nutrient intake participant . The parent ( guardian ) child train record food intake . The dietary record may start day week correspond day urine collection . The record comprise home food water intake well out-of-home food consumption . Food frequency questionnaire ( FFQ ) use combination dietary record evaluate long-term habitual iodine intake . Simultaneously , food sample , include locally-consumed food relatively high iodine content local resident generally consume frequently , sample determine iodine content , salt water . In Part 2 , Blood sample collect evaluate thyroid function thyroid auto-antibodies , thyroid volume child detect ultrasonography conduct professional technician Third stage : Iodine intake child calculate precisely comprehensively 24-h UIE dietary iodine intake ( described Part 1 ) . Adverse effect define parameter detect Part 2 .</detailed_description>
