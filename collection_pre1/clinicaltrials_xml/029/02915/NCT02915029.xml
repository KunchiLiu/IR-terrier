	<detailed_description>Hypothesis : ( 1 ) The Zuni Health Initiative ( ZHI ) integrate innovative approach Home base kidney care ( HBKC ) utilize tribal Community Health Representatives ( CHRs ) , Point Care ( POC ) technology , telemedicine motivational messaging conjunction patient preference Patient Activation Measures ( PAM ) chronic care model improve detection treatment Chronic Kidney Disease ( CKD ) relate risk factor ; ( 2 ) This model generalizable high-risk community e.g. , Hispanic American Indians Guadalupe , AZ study NIDDK , NIH-Phoenix . Specific Aim 1 : Re-phenotype prior participant , identify incident case CKD , estimate progression rate , identify participant propose study HBKC ; Specific Aim 2 : Conduct pilot study HBKC 120 people . Randomize household 1:1 allocation usual care versus HBKC . Compare change Patient Activation measure ( PAM ) , Adherence , BP , weight , HbA1c , UACR , eGFR lipid profile two group 1-year intervention period ; Specific Aim 3 : Inform design full-scale study estimate anticipated recruitment , adherence dropout rate , sample size reassess approach ; Specific Aim 4 : Assess exportability HBKC model Hispanics American Indians Guadalupe , AZ . Study Outcomes : ( 1 ) The PAM adherence ; ( 2 ) Changes clinical phenotype include Cr , UACR , A1c , body weight , BMI , fast glucose , blood pressure ( BP ) , plasma lipid , inflammatory marker ; ( 3 ) Changes quantitative trait diet score battery mental-health , self-efficacy , quality life instrument . Health Impact : The active participation Zuni tribal leadership IHS protocol , general affordability Zuni native CHR personnel , render outcome demonstrate proposal easily sustainable long term . If successful , program potential change best-practices CKD progression reduce health disparity cost-effective sustainable manner .</detailed_description>
