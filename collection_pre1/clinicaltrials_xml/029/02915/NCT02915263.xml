	<brief_summary>The goal pilot study obtain preliminary data magnitude treatment effect IVIG neuropathic pain neuropathy severity associate treatment induce neuropathy ( TIND ) . The investigator hypothesize immune globulin , administer intravenously ( IVIG ) , reduce pain associate treatment induce neuropathy reduce neuropathy severity . Treatment induce neuropathy diabetes , iatrogenic complication diabetes .

	<brief_title>The Efficacy Of Intravenous Immunoglobulin Therapy In Treatment Induced Neuropathy Of Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment induce neuropathy diabetes ( TIND ) , also refer insulin neuritis , think rare iatrogenic cause neuropathy occur set rapid glycemic control individual history prolong hyperglycemia . In recent paper , investigator report systematic review patient see tertiary diabetic neuropathy referral center result diagnosis TIND &gt; 10 % patient see 5 year period time . These individual develop symptom neuropathy consequence sudden improvement glycemic control . The neuropathy associate TIND painful small fiber autonomic neuropathy acute onset , also associate simultaneous development retinopathy nephropathy . TIND differs prevalent generalize neuropathy diabetes , distal sensory-motor polyneuropathy , several respect . The neuropathic pain acute onset , appear within 8 week glycemic change contrast insidious onset Diabetic sensorimotor polyneuropathy ( DSP ) . The pain TIND severe , poorly responsive intervention include opioids , whereas patient DSP respond non-opioid intervention . Although distribution pain length dependent individual TIND , frequently far extensive DSP associate allodynia hyperalgesia much prevalent . Autonomic symptoms sign common , prominent appear acutely , contrast relatively low prevalence , gradual onset slow progression DSP . Finally , pain autonomic feature may reversible patient . The pathogenic mechanism whereby change glucose result nerve damage and/or dysfunction know . Proposed mechanism include endoneurial ischemia due epineurial arterio-venous shunt , apoptosis due glucose deprivation , microvascular neuronal damage due recurrent hypoglycemia ectopic fire regenerate axon sprout , possibility unproven . A potential role inflammation cause TIND support study show increase pro-inflammatory cytokine provoke experimental hypoglycemia . This reinforced association hyperalgesia prior exposure hypoglycemia . Other microvascular complication commonly see patient TIND . The simultaneous development TIND , retinopathy nephropathy cohort suggest common systemic mechanism likely result microvascular disease . Prior report 'early worsen retinopathy ' associate great risk retinopathy development every percentage point decrease glycosylated hemoglobin , result parallel neuropathy development TIND . Furthermore , link hypoglycemia , production pro-inflammatory cytokine , development retinopathy propose . Treatment induce neuropathy iatrogenic cause acute , painful autonomic neuropathy patient poor glycemic control . Although underlying mechanism yet know , clear relationship rapid rate glycemic control development microvascular complication . Our preliminary data upregulation cytokine individual TIND , similar finding note early worsening retinopathy , suggest possibility early intervention may improve outcome . The investigator study 100 individual TIND longitudinal fashion . The characteristic disease progression well described related magnitude change HbA1c . All patient develop severe neuropathic pain progressive small fiber autonomic neuropathy . The neuropathy progress 18-24 month may gradually improve . The investigator study 4 patient TIND develop acute onset autonomic peripheral neuropathy set rapid glycemic control . All 4 individual regular detailed neurological examination , skin biopsy analysis nerve fiber density , autonomic function test retinal examination . Within 4 week onset neuropathic pain ( within 8 week change glucose level ) , offer trial immune globulin administration dose 2grams/kg divide 5 dos 0.4 grams/kg 5 day . In 3 4 patient significant improvement neuropathic pain ( &gt; 50 % ) autonomic dysfunction 4 week immune globulin administration . In addition , clinically significant increase intra-epidermal nerve fiber density 6 month ( finding see large cohort individual untreated ) . One patient exhibit clear improvement neuropathic pain autonomic dysfunction . Prior immune globulin administration investigator measure circulate cytokine level 4 individual . Those respond tend higher circulate cytokine level individual . The investigator propose prospective therapeutic study determine efficacy IVIG improve neuropathic pain nerve fiber structure function individual TIND . In addition , investigator attempt define mechanism predict success trial .</detailed_description>
