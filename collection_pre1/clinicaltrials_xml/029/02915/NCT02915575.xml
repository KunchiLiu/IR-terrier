	<detailed_description>Research Objective : To evaluate impact risk base decision support process care high-risk patient follow discharge hospitalization Acute Kidney injury . Experimental Strategy- rationale consideration : International guideline Chronic Kidney disease diagnosis management provide stage-based management approach reduce risk adverse cardiovascular renal outcome base estimate glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) proteinuria . Identified key quality indicator CKD care include use statin CKD patient great age 50 , diabetes cardiovascular disease , use ACEi ( angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ) ARB ( angiotensin receptor blocker ) patient proteinuria referral nephrology care sustain eGFR &lt; 30/ml/min/1.73m2 . patient low risk CKD effectively manage primary care give appropriate support . Study investigator evaluate identification CKD provide lab requisition study participant . Those medium high risk group CKD base risk index guide either primary care web-based CKD care pathway help Primary care Physicians identify , treat refer CKD patient use best practice , nephrology care , respectively . Transitional care intervention show effective prevent readmission chronic condition heart failure . Specialist care delivery often multidisciplinary clinic find improve prescription proven efficacious medication outcome number chronic disease setting include heart failure , Myocardial infarction , asthma CKD . As specific intervention treat Acute kidney injury ensure high adherence CKD care affect individual feasible , sustainable strategy . Participants The trial population comprise consent adult patient admit general medical surgical teaching ward 2 center , University Alberta Hospital Edmonton Foothills Hospital Calgary . Randomization Participants randomize either Control arm Experimental arm Control arm ( Usual Care ) : Participants discharge per usual ward discharge protocol . A requisition follow-up lab ( serum creatinine , serum electrolyte , urine albumin/creatinine ratio ) draw 90 day give participant . Appointments/referrals leave discretion care team . Experimental arm ( Risk Guided Follow-up ) : Participants stratify risk CKD three group : low ( &lt; 20 % risk CKD ) , medium ( 20-50 % risk CKD ) high ( &gt; 50 % risk CKD ) use risk index develop team . Specific follow-up guide risk status . Analysis Plan : The primary analysis follow intention-to-treat approach . In sensitivity analysis , outcome base predict risk CKD stratify . Descriptive statistic bivariate test association use appropriate evaluate group difference various time point follow-up . Associations key variable study outcomes analyze use appropriate univariate , multivariate mixed model multilevel analysis . No interim analysis plan due short duration trial .</detailed_description>
