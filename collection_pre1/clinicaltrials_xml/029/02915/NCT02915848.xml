	<brief_summary>Movement disorder Parkinson Disease , dystonia , tremor related abnormality part brain know basal ganglion . Recently , suggest basal ganglion work oscillation ( group neuron cycle activation/deactivation stimulate ) electrical signal . A treatment involve insertion electrode subthalamic nucleus ( STN ) electrical stimulation , know deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) , establish treatment advance Parkinson 's disease . However mechanism action still completely understood . Currently , DBS utilize `` open loop '' system whereby stimulation setting manually adjust depend patient ' clinical response . 1 . Determine whether local field potential ( LFP ) record STN stable 1.5 year period . 2 . Address whether STN LFP suitable control signal , use change DBS parameter</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Long-term Stability LFP Recorded From STN Effects DBS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design Methods Ten Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) patient schedule bilateral STN DBS recruit . DBS surgery perform Toronto Western Hospital per standard clinical care . The study perform two site : Toronto Western Hospital London Mobility Laboratory Western University . Recording STN LFP use externalize DBS lead , effect DBS different frequency PD motor symptom study Toronto Western Hospital . Gait study full body kinematic measurement , record LFP effect different stimulation frequency study London Mobility Laboratory ( LML ) Western University . An outline study timeline provide Table ( 2 , 3 4 ) . Standardized task perform provide Table 5.Ten PD patient bilateral DBS STN study six visit site ( TWH LML ) . There also presurgical baseline visit LML . Patients first study 1-3 day DBS electrode implantation implantation pulse generator . Local field potential ( LFP ) record bilateral STN DBS electrodes use externalize lead . Following internalization DBS lead insertion pulse generator ( Activa PC+S , Medtronic ) , patient study within 7 day second visit . DBS program perform per usual clinical practice . Patients study 1 , 2 , 6 , 12 18 month postoperatively . Visits Toronto Western Hospital ( TWH ) Visit 1 ( TWH V1 ) This visit obtain `` acute '' LFP record comparison chronic recording . Patients study 1-3 day electrode insertion lead externalize . This two day visit , one day medication state ( overnight withdrawal ) one day medication state random order . For medication state , 125 % levodopa equivalent first morning preoperative dose administer increase chance record levodopa-induced dyskinesia . Stage 1 : LFP record bilateral STN DBS electrodes together scalp EEG . Fig . 3 show schematic representation record setup . Surface EMG accelerometery use measure tremor frequency levodopa-induced dyskinesia . mUPDRS Rush dyskinesia rating scale ( medication recording ) assessment perform . Recordings make rest patient perform self-paced wrist extension movement . The prominent LFP frequency θ , β γ band oscillation rest voluntary movement medication state ( individualized frequency ) well electrode contact show prominent LFP oscillation determine patient . This record take one hour . The data analysis take one hour patient break . Stage 2 : This involve stimulation . The DBS lead connect external stimulator `` filter DBS '' device record LFP DBS . Four DBS condition study random order : 1 ) high frequency ( 185 Hz ) , 2 ) individualize γ frequency show maximum peak rest ( γ rest , determine stage 1 ) , 3 ) individualize γ frequency show maximum increase voluntary movement ( γ movement , determine stage 1 ) , 4 ) stimulation . The contact select base location within STN postoperative MRI use method publish group maximum change θ β band voluntary movement ( Stage 1 ) . The selected DBS contact cathode ( -ve ) anode ( +ve ) surface electrode place chest wall ( similar contact -ve , case +ve commonly use therapeutic DBS ) . Pulse width set at100 μs current high ( maximum 5 mA ) without induce adverse effect . LFP record electrode contact adjacent one use DBS use bipolar montage allow maximum cancellation stimulus artifact . For example , contact 2 use DBS , LFP record contact 1 3 . For condition , 15 min DBS resting follow mUPDRS assessment DBS maintain . Patients video record allow subsequent video score mUPDRS Rush dyskinesia rating scale blind raters . DBS right leave STN study random order , one side morning one side afternoon . Investigators perform complex stimulation protocol PD patient STN DBS . The second day study occur next day . The procedure Day 1 except medication status ( medication ) alternate Day 1 random order . Visit 2 ( TWH-V2 ) The purpose visit obtain early LFP record Activa PC+S device DBS programming begin . This visit conduct within 4 week internalization DBS lead insertion pulse generator ( Activa PC+S ) , pulse generator turn program . The visit conduct two day , one day medication state ( overnight withdrawal ) one day medication state random order Visit 1 . The procedure identical Visit 1 record LFP rest self-paced wrist extension task , follow test 4 different stimulation condition . However , LFP record Activa PC+S device use real-time uplink mode provide continuous record rather externalize lead . Since device record LFP one pair contact electrode ( right left ) time , recording rest state examine difference medication , investigator use `` montage sweep '' mode record alternately six possible combination bipolar contact ( 0-1 , 1-2 , 2-3 , 0-2 , 0-3 , 1-3 ) electrode . For wrist extension movement , record bipolar contact pair produce great change γ oscillation dopaminergic medication voluntary movement base result Visit 1 . In addition , record adjacent contact pair . For example , contact 1-2 find produce maximum γ peak , contact 1-2 well contact 0-1 2-3 study . Each pair electrode contact study separate run . Following LFP record ( stage 1 ) , individual γ frequency peak establish . Stage 2 study effect DBS high frequency , γ rest , γ movement stimulation assess random order record STN LFP stimulation Visit 1 . The contact use DBS Visit 1 use monopolar montage ( contact -ve , case +ve ) . LFP record adjacent contact bipolar montage describe Visit 1 implant Activa PC+S device use LFP record Visits 3- 6 ( TWH-V3 , V4 , V5 V6 ) After Visit 2 , DBS program perform per usual clinical practice take 2-4 week complete . Patients study 2 , 6 , 12 , 18 month surgery . The assessment procedure identical Visit 2 except `` high '' frequency stimulation set set normally use patient clinical benefit ( 130-185 Hz ) instead 185 Hz . Visits London Mobility Laboratory ( Western University ) Visit 1 occur surgery obtain baseline gait kinematic measurement data medication state . For visit 2 , 3 7 , TWH visit occur 1-5 day London Mobility Laboratory visit . The γ frequency stimulation use London Mobility Laboratory visit `` γ movement '' frequency determine correspond TWH visit .</detailed_description>
