	<brief_summary>Essential hypertension complex trait result interaction environmental factor genetic factor . Our study aim detect differential expression LncRNAs epigenetic change DNA methylation associate salt sensitive hypertension human base chronic salt load study conduct Lantian county , China . Firstly , chronic salt load study conduct Chinese population differentiate salt-sensitive salt-resistant individual . Second , LncRNAs DNA methylation Chip analysis perform use sample collect salt-sensitive salt resistant individual , result analyze modern bioinformatics method seek differential genetic marker . In addition , investigator also try examine effect chronic salt load BP , ambulatory BP , microalbuminuria baPWV biochemical index . This project great significance reveal molecular genetics mechanism development salt , salt-sensitive hypertension .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The main content include : ( 1 ) Questionnaire design : questionnaire design accord research content purpose . The standard questionnaire use collect general information , dietary habit , lifestyle , medical history family history etc . ( 2 ) Anthropometric measurement : blood pressure , height , body weight , waist hip , pulse acquire medical practitioner receive professional training base World Health Organization ( WHO ) standard , pass relevant examination . ( 3 ) Dietary intervention : The dietary intervention comprise 3-day baseline observation period , low-salt diet 7 day ( 3g salt 51.3mmol sodium per day ) high-salt diet 7 day ( 18g salt 307.8mmol sodium per day ) . During baseline period , subject give detailed dietary instruction avoid table salt , cook salt , high-salt food 21-day study duration . To ensure compliance study participant intervention program , require breakfast , lunch , dinner study kitchen supervision study staff entire study period . All food cook without salt . Onsite study staff member add prepackaged salt meal individual subject indicate study protocol . ( 4 ) Blood urine sample collection : morning fasting blood , nocturnal enuresis , 24-hour urine specimen collect medical staff , blind tubes set accord 5 % total sample . Blood biochemistry include serum total cholesterol , HDL cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , triglyceride , fast glucose , creatinine hsCRP measure use automatic biochemical analyzer . The sodium potassium concentration urine measure flame photometry . The total sodium potassium excretion urine 24h calculated multiply concentration 24-h volume urine . ( 5 ) DNA methylation LncRNA detection : Using method modify hydrogen sulfite salt gene chip technology detect DNA methylation LncRNA . ( 6 ) LncRNA : LncRNA measure gene chip technology high salt intervention period . ( 7 ) Auxiliary examination : Auxiliary examination include carotid intima-media thickness , endothelium-dependent vasodilation ( FMD ) , measurements brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity ( baPWV ) electrocardiographic parameter . The measurement do hospital medical practitioner receive professional training pass relevant examination . ( 8 ) Data process statistic : investigator input data database , utilize software SPSS , STATA , Haploview FBAT analyze . ( 9 ) Quality control : ① Questionnaire strictly design amended epidemiologist clinical expert . ② A standardized `` Investigator Handbook '' stipulate accord guideline . ③ Staff member require rigorous train pas exam . ④ The investigation process strictly supervise principal investigator . ⑤ Data entry use parallel double entry method . ⑥ During laboratory testing , blank control blind detection apply ensure quality . ⑦Data analysis perform 2-3 postgraduate , inconsistent data need double check .</detailed_description>
