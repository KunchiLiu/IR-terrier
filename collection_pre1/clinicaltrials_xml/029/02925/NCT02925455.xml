	<brief_summary>This pilot randomize control trial intervention improve arm function child age 6 17 cerebral palsy upper limb hemiparesis . Twenty participant randomize either group treat neuromuscular electrical stimulation video game video game alone . Both group receive 6 wks treatment consist home lab session . Both experiment group control group intervention consist therapist-guided session rehabilitation clinic self-administered caregiver-assisted session home . While group receive task practice video game training , experiment group receive electrical stimulation device assist hand open practice . Changes upper extremity motor impairment function assess participant baseline , mid treatment , end treatment 3 mo follow-up .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Rehabilitation clinic session - These occur twice per week first 3 week per week second 3 week 6 week treatment . They therapist-guided last 90 min consist 45 minute contralaterally-controlled functional electrical stimulation ( CCFES ) -mediated video game 45 minute CCFES-mediated functional task practice . Early session focus train patient caregiver self-administer play CCFES-mediated video game home . As proficiency one game develop , game introduce . The functional task practice part session engage participant use CCFES system assist practice use hand activity lace bead , throw ball , eat finger food , play activity daily live . Prior start lab treatment , investigator assess hand extensor flexor muscle co-activation ( see ) . Home session - These consist CCFES-mediated hand open video game exercise caregiver assistance supervision need . As proficiency develop game add , home session increase duration 90 minute per day , determine treat therapist base adherence participant . Self report game difficulty engagement make completion game ( see )</detailed_description>
