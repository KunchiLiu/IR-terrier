	<brief_summary>It purpose study determine commercially available electronic stethoscope synchronize smart phone iPad application use accurate objective screen tool measure dysphagia . The investigator plan two phase ; Phase I investigators recruit normal subject establish normal swallow pattern , well optimal sensor placement ; Phase II investigator compare recording obtain electronic stethoscope obtain use videofluoroscopy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In study , investigator use commercially available electronic stethoscope ass dysphagia patient recently experience stroke . The Eko Core electronic stethoscope approve Food Drug Agency ( FDA ) currently available use health care context . Phase I In first phase study investigator try establish electronic stethoscope 's measurement normal swallow pattern . The investigator recruit healthy control auscultate swallow sound three location : anterolateral section neck , posterior section neck , superior sternum illustrate Figure 1 . After sensor place , participant ask perform follow test : - Dry Swallow - ask participant swallow saliva - Ask participant swallow 1 teaspoon water - Ask participant swallow 3 ounce water ( continuous ) - Ask participant swallow one teaspoon applesauce - Ask participant chew one cracker Healthy subject recruit advertisement use flyer . Interested individual able contact study coordinator email phone . Subsequently , participant present consent test CSMC rehabilitation gym ( North Tower 7215 ) Pacific Theaters Building ( 116 N. Robertson ) mutually agree time . The result test use determine electronic stethoscope 's measurement normal swallow pattern . Additionally , investigator determine optimal sensor location measure quality recording obtain location , get participant input regard prefer sensor location . Signal quality determine observe loudness swallow signal relative loudness background noise ( heartbeat , pulse , etc . ) three location . Phase II As part standard care , stroke patient CSMC undergo swallow screen nursing staff bedside . If patient fails bedside screen , referral make physician clinical swallow evaluation swallow therapist . If patient fail clinical swallow evaluation , referral make physician instrumental swallow evaluation often videofluoroscopy swallow study . At bedside , electronic stethoscope use monitor patient ' pharyngeal acoustic signal undergo swallow evaluation monitor member research team . During Phase II subject undergo evaluation electronic stethoscope . Regarding VSS , entirely dependent upon manage medical team physician . The investigator anticipate number patient undergo VSS . If VSS require , order timing determine medical team . Given dynamic nature acute inpatient setting , detail time VSS anticipate . Potential participant identify daily stroke list CS-Link , review investigator access list part routine daily operation . The investigator access patient list part quality oversight . Per request waiver consent/authorization , patient select list base inclusion/exclusion criterion . Subsequently , treat physician contact approval recruit patient . Once approval give , investigator visit patient ask willing participate . The investigator consent patient able communicate clear understanding study , demonstrate understand purpose , procedure , risk benefit study . If patient understand purpose study , risk , benefit consent . Eligible patient approached member research team discus study detail obtain consent . Once consent obtain , electronic stethoscope place location find Phase I optimal , patient ask perform follow test bedside videofluoroscopy swallow study : - Dry Swallow-Ask patient swallow saliva - Ask patient swallow 1 teaspoon water - Ask patient swallow 3 ounce water ( continuous ) - Ask patient swallow one teaspoon applesauce - Ask patient chew one cracker The following outcome measure evaluation : - Timing swallow onset ( time hyoid elevation ) - Duration pharyngeal phase swallow - Timing esophageal phase onset - Duration esophageal phase swallow - Coughing ( Yes/No ) - Throat clearing ( Yes/No ) - Pharyngeal pooling ( Yes/No ) - Spontaneous multiple swallow ( one ) clear bolus ( Yes/No ) The investigator compare data obtain use videofluoroscopy swallow study signal record electronic stethoscope determine whether pattern detect electronic stethoscope concur obtain via videofluoroscopy swallow study . Additionally , investigator compare result similar test perform nurse swallow therapist . Lastly , investigator compare data obtain electronic stethoscope healthy control Phase I data obtain stroke patient Phase II , investigator try determine whether signal record differentiate normal abnormal swallowing pattern . Patients compensate participation study .</detailed_description>
