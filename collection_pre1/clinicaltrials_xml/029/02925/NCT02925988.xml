	<brief_summary>Over past decade , technical advance improve efficiency continuous EEG record remote review , lead steep increase number continuous EEGs perform , emerge change consider standard care regard brain monitoring . Critically ill patient high risk CNS insult , result permanent neurologic disability untreated . Non-convulsive status epilepticus secondary brain injury often unrecognized without continuous EEG monitoring . There increase evidence continuous EEG monitoring facilitate early identification management change brain function , recent consensus statement conclude `` center provide critical care continuous EEG high level local resource allow '' . Neonatal neuro-intensive care rapidly develop field focus monitor develop brain . Without continuous EEG monitoring , neonates paroxysmal event suspicious seizure treat phenobarbital , often many month , inherent risk side effect . Because paroxysmal event neonate may may represent seizure , electrographic seizure may discernable clinical correlate , approach fails adequately diagnose seizure expose neonate possible harm , either medication overuse paroxysmal event electrographic correlate , under-treatment seizure without clinical manifestation . Amplitude-integrated EEG technology increasingly use simplify monitoring method , use few number electrodes usually interpret neonatologist trainee . This model implement investigator NICU . However , recent systematic review come conclusion amplitude-integrated EEG relatively low variable sensitivity specificity , therefore mainstay diagnosis management neonatal seizure . Continuous video EEG monitoring recommend gold standard critically ill neonate , expensive resource-intense method . An approach combine technique standardize algorithm may provide improved patient care resource-restricted environment . The investigator plan test hypothesis pilot project .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combined Amplitude-integrated Conventional EEG Monitoring High-risk Critically Ill Neonates</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HYPOTHESIS An algorithm combine conventional amplitude-integrated EEG monitoring increase specificity sensitivity seizure detection critically ill high-risk neonate resource-restricted environment . OBJECTIVES 1 . To describe sensitivity specificity amplitude-integrated EEG ( aEEG ) relative conventional EEG ( cEEG ) monitor high-risk critically ill neonates 2 . To evaluate feasibility algorithm combine amplitude-integrated conventional EEG monitoring high-risk critically ill neonate Long-term Objectives The propose pilot research project provide fundamental information essential designing future large scale study analyze standardize algorithm combine continuous EEG monitoring high-risk critically ill neonate investigator NICU , ultimate goal prevent secondary brain injury patient . Parents potentially eligible patient approach study team member receive study information . Consent attain sufficient time review consent form ask question . This prospective study . We aim enroll 20 neonate high risk seizure , consecutively . Monitoring Electrode positioning : The aEEG cEEG consist 3 5 8 14 electrode respectively . Neonatal EEG application set follow international standard protocol use investigator NICU . The electrode replace unless signal interruption . A local skin lesion might occur , rare case , prolong EEG ( 2-3 day ) . Monitoring protocol : Neonates receive amplitude-integrated EEG monitoring soon indication monitoring establish , conventional EEG electrode apply parallel , soon EEG technician available , usually within less 16 hour , many case within 1-4 hour . Amplitude-integrated EEGs read interpret continuously , currently standard care investigator NICU . Conventional EEGs interpret neurologist . During review process , neurology conventional EEG interpretation team blind result amplitude-integrated EEG read neonatology team , vice versa . Electrographic seizure event clinically relevant finding ( e.g . abnormality background activity ) communicate NICU staff ( accordance current practice ) . EEG monitoring perform long current NICU guideline require . Measures capture include : - Time duration seizure per clinical observation - Time duration seizure per amplitude integrate EEG - Time duration seizure per conventional EEG - Time duration background activity abnormality per amplitude integrate EEG - Time duration background activity abnormality per conventional EEG - Other relevant finding amplitude integrate EEG ( e.g . localization-related ) - Other relevant finding conventional EEG ( e.g . localization-related )</detailed_description>
