	<brief_summary>The investigator propose three-arm , pragmatic , cluster-randomized clinical trial base primary care . Participating Primary Care Providers ( PCPs ) randomize usual care one two intervention arm . The first intervention evaluate efficacy automate CDSS utilizes electronic health record ( EHR ) facilitate triple marker test ordering , guideline implementation BP management , compare usual care , among patient previous documentation eGFRcreat &lt; 60 ml/min/1.73m2 . The second intervention go step , evaluate whether CDSS plus pharmacist-led CKD management program ( CDSS PLUS ) improve BP management patient CKD NSAID toxicity knowledge among patient newly confirm higher-risk CKD ( eGFRcreat-cys ( &lt; 45 ) eGFR ( 45-59 ) + ACR ≥30 ) , compare CDSS alone . The primary clinical outcome BP level , secondary outcome related process care patient knowledge .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Electronic CKD Clinical Decision Support System ( CDSS ) Clinical Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Setting : The investigator conduct study within three General Internal Medicine ( GIM ) practice UCSF . These include general internal medicine faculty physicians resident practice primary care 10 clinical team . This trial specifically design work within framework exist infrastructure practice . Duration Intervention Period : 12 month total follow-up period 18 month Randomization : The unit randomization PCP ; 44 faculty physician , 3 nurse practitioner ( NPs ) 66 resident practice 10 clinical team . Training Pre-Trial Preparation : Prior begin trial , eligible PCPs UCSF GIM practice opportunity education Kidney Disease - Improving Global Outcomes ( KDIGO ) guideline form Grand Rounds . All clinical provider inform trial PI via email time opportunity opt-out . PCP randomization perform study coordinator use automated procedure . The PCPs randomize intervention option view training video design study PIs IT expert automate CKD CDSS . Blinding : The analyst remain blinded throughout trial data analysis . Intervention Details ( CKD CDSS ) : The CKD CDSS develop study PIs IT expert , refine use physician feedback . While tool automate much possible use electronic medical record , physician decision making require diagnostic treatment step CDSS . At time patient enrol , use EHR , investigator record date next scheduled appointment PCP . If patient schedule visit within 90 day , PCP receive initial basket message 14 day schedule visit . The purpose initial message alert PCP patient eligible CDSS facilitate ordering test prior study visit . At point , CDSS offer PCP three option : A ) order 3 test , B ) postpone , C ) n't ask . If PCP choose C , menu option appear select reason opt . These include exclusion criterion `` I deem test appropriate patient '' . If patient schedule appointment &gt; 90 day future , PCP receive similar message patient identify meeting enrollment criterion , follow subsequent message 14 day prior visit , . The CDSS allow `` second-chance '' test order order place prior encounter , engage medical assistant ( MA ) . In GIM practice , MA triages patient , obtain vital sign review due/overdue health care maintenance patient , MA able `` pend '' order physician consider sign visit . In case PCP yet order creatinine , cystatin C ACR eligible patient , order appear health care maintenance `` to-do 's '' MA `` pend '' . Study staff check intervention PCP schedule monthly basis upcoming appointment eligible patient previously schedule . Once test order , patient proceed laboratory normally would clinical practice . Patients alert pending lab via telephone call team MA ( usual practice ) . Patients cell phone receive additional reminder via secure text message ( newly available UCSF ) . Once lab performed test , result appear physician 's electronic inbox Results folder ( PCP usually expect ) . An additional customized result note send PCP patient , flag CKD-action require folder , ( see Figure 3 ) include recommended action item . These result include calculated eGFR creatinine , cystatin C combine creat-cys use CKD Epi equation . For determination CKD stage , investigator use combined equation , show best estimate measure glomerular filtration rate . For suggested action item , PCP signature require . Links KDIGO heat-map available . The note include reminder educate patient CKD status NSAID avoidance . A .dot phrase ( pre-populated phrase template appear preceded 'dot ' documentation area Epic ) use assessment plan section note patient information section visit summary available PCPs document patient education . CDSS PLUS : The rationale third arm base evidence clinical pharmacist nurse show effective physician alone achieve BP control setting . However , require much high cost electronic CDSS alone require patient attend many extra appointment . Thus important quantify add benefit clinical pharmacist program , well expenditures , feasibility acceptability , order identify effective feasible intervention . Upon receipt referral PCP , pharmacist schedule series appointment aim BP control , initiation up-titration angiotensin convert enzyme ( ACE ) / angiotensin receptor blocker ( ARB ) therapy albuminuria , assessment medication risk adherence , education . At visit , pharmacist measure record three seat BP reading per guideline , perform medication inventory . Management follow previously design algorithm follow establish guideline management high BP person CKD . The goal achieve BP &lt; 140/90 mmHg use ACE/ARB albuminuria unless contraindicate . An option goal &lt; 120/80 mmHg also available request PCP result SPRINT study change guideline . The intervention last 12 month . Initially , pharmacist follow-up visit every six week , patient 's BP control two consecutive visit , follow-up space every 12 week . At end 12 month , pharmacist longer follow patient . To verify fidelity intervention , pharmacist present several randomly choose case nephrologist involved algorithm design ( Dr. Peralta ) . The pharmacist use previously use test CKD education ( NKDEP ) NSAID education material .</detailed_description>
