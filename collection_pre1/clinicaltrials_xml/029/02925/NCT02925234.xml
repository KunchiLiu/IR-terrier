	<brief_summary>This prospective , non-randomized clinical trial aim describe efficacy toxicity commercially available , targeted anticancer drugs* prescribe treatment patient advance cancer potentially actionable variant reveal genomic protein expression test . The study also aim simplify patient access approve targeted therapy contribute program collaborate pharmaceutical company perform next generation sequence tumor biopsy biomarker analysis . Eligible patient advance solid tumor , multiple myeloma B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma standard treatment option longer available acceptable performance status organ function . A genomic protein expression test must perform tumor result must identify least one potentially actionable molecular variant define protocol . Results molecular profile test use determine appropriate drug ( ) among available protocol . The choice drug support list potential profile , molecular tumor board , knowledge library study coordinator review approval match . The protocol-specified treatment administer patient drug-specific eligibility criterion confirm fresh pre-treatment biopsy perform future genetic study . All patient receive treatment drug available protocol follow standard efficacy outcome include tumor response , progression-free overall survival well duration treatment . In addition , treatment related toxicity evaluate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Problem description : evidence building match target agent tumor characteristic improve outcomes . Such report fuel interest among patient physician use molecular test treatment plan standard treatment option exhaust . When oncologist aim provide personalized treatment patient though , obtain drug challenge since off-label prescribing , legal , generally reimburse insurance company . Furthermore , outcomes off-label treatment routine clinical practice systematically record . As result , research clinical community limit insight outcome , lead repetitive use ineffective treatment tumor type , effective treatment strategy might miss others . The latter especially relevant 'orphan disease ' , rare conduct formal phase II III trial . In summary , lack access potentially effective therapy one hand , lack knowledge broader use therapy , altogether lead sub-optimal use available resource . Envisioned solution study aim : creation drug-access program , patient treat registered targeted therapy match molecular tumor profile , outcomes therapy record systematically , per tumor profile tumor type ( important since become increasingly clear tissue origin important determinant outcome genetic abnormality ) . We hereby aim improve broaden use register targeted therapy , whilst facilitate patient access therapy . Plan investigation : patient treat approve targeted agent , select base result molecular profile test patient 's tumor . Eligible patient exhausted standard treatment option , tumor must harbor potentially actionable molecular variant define protocol . The study provide tumor board help physician understand profile test result treatment option , enable insight utility approach . In addition , next generation sequence perform fresh tumor biopsy additional biomarker discovery . Patients Netherlands USA include two similar though independent protocol ( DRUP TAPUR ) , allow data-exchange empowering trial . Expected outcome : early sign clinical activity approve drug outside label , provide effective personalize treatment option , improve patient outcomes access target therapy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Adult ( age &gt; 18 year ) patient histologicallyproven locally advanced metastatic solid tumor , multiple myeloma B cell nonHodgkin lymphoma longer benefit standard anticancer treatment treatment available indicate . * For GBM patient : Histologically confirm recurrent de novo glioblastoma ( primary ) , unequivocal first progression radiotherapy concurrent/adjuvant chemotherapy , least 3 month concomitant part chemoradiotherapy , stable decrease dosage steroid least 7 day prior baseline MRI scan . 2 . ECOG performance status 02 3 . Patients must acceptable organ function define . However , specific inclusion/exclusion criterion specify drugspecific study manual take precedence : 1 . Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 x 109/l 2 . Hemoglobin &gt; 5.6 mmol/l 3 . Platelets &gt; 75 x 109/l 4 . Total bilirubin &lt; 2 x ULN 5 . AST ( SGOT ) ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; 2.5 x institutional ULN ( &lt; 5 x ULN patient know hepatic metastasis ) 6 . Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 × ULN calculate measured creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min/1.73 m2 4 . Patients must objectively evaluable measurable disease ( physical radiographic examination , accord RECIST v1.1 patient solid tumor , accord IMWG , Lugano , RANO GCIG criterion , resp. , patient multiple myeloma , nonHodgkin lymphoma , glioblastoma ovarian cancer case CA125based evaluation ( please refer appendix detail ) [ 16 , 17 ] . 5 . Results must available tumor genomic protein expression test . Eligible test may include follow technology : fluorescence situ hybridization ( FISH ) , polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) , comparative genomic hybridization ( CGH ) , next generation sequencing ( NGS ) immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) . The test may perform primary tumor metastatic deposit , diagnostic laboratory within context another CPCT study , must reveal potentially actionable variant define Section 5 . The test result ( full pathology molecular diagnostics report ) must upload eCRF . 6 . Patients must tumor profile single agent treatment one EMA approve targeted anticancer drug include study potential clinical benefit base preclinical data clinical information ( see section 5 ) . 7 . A new ( obtain ≤2 month inclusion , without type anticancer therapy within ≤2 month ) fresh frozen tumor biopsy specimen extensive biomarker test mandatory start treatment target agent include protocol . *For GBM patient : The mandatory fresh frozen tumor biopsy sample obtain standardofcare surgical procedure ( i.e. , perform progression , cytoreduction , proof progressive disease , reduce mass effect surround brain tissue ) . Thus , surgical procedure standardofcare part trial participation . Fresh frozen tumor tissue must obtain ≤2 month inclusion , without type anticancer therapy within ≤2 month . After surgical procedure , patient must meet follow inclusion criterion : . Surgery must confirm recurrence . ii . A postsurgery MRI available within 48 hour follow surgery , must show residual measurable disease . iii . Craniotomy intracranial biopsy site must adequately heal free drainage cellulitis , underlie cranioplasty must appear intact time study inclusion . 8 . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . 9 . For orally administer drug , patient must able swallow tolerate oral medication must know malabsorption syndrome . 10 . Because risks drug treatment develop foetus , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) duration study participation , four month follow completion study therapy . Male patient avoid impregnate female partner . Male patient , even surgically sterilize , ( i.e . postvasectomy ) must agree one following : practice effective barrier contraception entire study treatment period 4 month last dose study drug , completely abstain sexual intercourse . 1 . Ongoing toxicity &gt; grade 2 , alopecia . 2 . Patient receive anticancer therapy ( cytotoxic , biologic , radiation , hormonal replacement ) except medication prescribe supportive care may potentially anticancer effect ( e.g. , megestrol acetate , bisphosphonates ) . These medication must start ≥ 1 week prior enrollment study . 3 . Patient pregnant nursing . 4 . Patients know active progressive brain metastasis . Patients previously treat brain metastasis eligible , provide patient experienced seizure clinically significant change neurological status within 3 month prior registration . All patient previously treat brain metastasis must stable least 1 month completion treatment steroid treatment prior study enrollment . * Additional exclusion criterion specific glioblastoma patient : 1 . Patients require anticonvulsant therapy must take nonenzyme induce antiepileptic drug ( nonEIAED ) . EIAED prohibit . Patients previously EIAED must switch nonEIAED least 2 week prior randomization . 2 . No radiotherapy within three month prior diagnosis progression . 3 . No radiotherapy dose 65 Gy , stereotactic radiosurgery brachytherapy unless recurrence histologically proven . 5 . Patients clinically significant preexist cardiac condition , include uncontrolled symptomatic angina , uncontrolled atrial ventricular arrhythmia , symptomatic congestive heart failure eligible . 6 . Patients know leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) &lt; 40 % eligible 7 . Patients stroke ( include TIA ) acute myocardial infarction within 3 month first dose study treatment eligible 8 .
