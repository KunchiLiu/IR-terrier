	<brief_title>Effects Gunnar Computer Glasses Viewing Comfort Performance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>&lt; Introduction &gt; When perform near work , one must focus ( accommodate ) point toward ( converge ) close distance , constantly re-focus eye order see small text image clarity . Sustaining effort lead eye fatigue eye strain , among host vision problem . Most visual task screen also demand heighten visual concentration decrease blink rate . Combined work heat air-conditioned office environment , lead over-evaporation tear film lipid deficiency , irritation dryness surface cornea expect . Disruptive glare excessive screen reflection ambient light also deteriorate image quality heap view discomfort . With extensive screen view also exacerbate discomfort people exist vision problem like eye muscle imbalance , astigmatism , farsightedness presbyopia . Since technology almost unavoidable modern life , prevention take lessen total toll eye visual system . Gunnar computer glass address issue provide mild yellow tint anti-reflection coating aim shield harmful blue light lessen strong glare . The glass also small amount magnification ( +0.5 D ) enhance acuity . The curved frame design retain moisture reduce dry eye symptom . All special character devise enhance visual performance minimize eye fatigue visual discomfort digital viewing . The current study aim validate aforementioned benefit . Gunnar over-the counter ( OTC ) computer glass adopt yellow lens cut active short wavelength lessen bright glare , often induce detrimental effect cause excessive illumination intense scatter reflection . While general benefit glare reduction well receive , benefit visual performance inconclusive . Some study report significant enhancement contrast sensitivity , fail see improvement visual acuity contrast sensitivity , even color distortion . Without argument , tint lens reduce transmittance visible spectrum change visible color certain degree . However , report reduction retinal illumination level necessarily lead reduced brightness ; instead , visual system automatically adjust illumination discounting , possibly help increase pupil size . In addition , decrement blue light arrive eye , scatter reflection chromatic aberration reduce . Together , reasonable believe visual acuity , contrast sensitivity , chromatic discrimination suffer may , instead , benefit filter yellow lens . These basic visual function may , turn , lead enhancement general visual performance routine office work . These test propose study . The current study test Gunnar 's OTC computer glass provide advantage , comparison glass , follow aspect computer-related office work : - Any enhancement visual performance basic visual function , include visual acuity , contrast sensitivity , color discrimination , etc . - Any enhancement visual performance typical office work , include reading , word-spelling check , number searching , target identification . - Any benefit preventing dry eye measure humidity outside inside frame ( visit Gunnar glass ) tear film break-up time view prolonged period time . - Any benefit objective view comfort measure view distance , blink frequency , post-viewing pupil size . - Any benefit subjective viewing comfort reflect questionnaire view symptom survey . - Any benefit view comfort visual performance increase environmental ventilation . - Any benefit view comfort visual performance increase environmental strong glare . - Any benefit life quality daily wear ( e.g. , view comfort , sleep quality quantity due amount stimulation blue light ) ? - Their willingness purchase ( select ) test Gunnar OTC glass , price willing pay . &lt; Study design &gt; Thirty-four subject , age 18 42 , plan recruit . This sample size base priori power analysis 80 % medium effect size alpha equal 0.05 . Subjects stratify 4 age group . About equal number ( 8Â±1 ) subject recruit group : - 18-23 yr old - 24-29 yr old - 30-35 yr old - 36-42 yr old Each subject schedule 3 visit : Visit 1 screen consenting , visit 2 lab test treatment 1 , visit 3 lab test treatment 2 . Between visit adaptation period assign treatment . Visit 1 : Screening visit - Day 1 , subject first join study - Obtain informed consent screen measurement ( VA , contrast sensitivity , tear film break-up time dry eye measurement , Dry eye questionnaire ( OSDI ) , view symptom survey ( VSS ) , history dry eye computer work behavior ) . - At end visit , half subject give pair Gunnar OTC glass adaptation 3 - 7 day ; half give treatment . All subject tell work front computer least 4 hour day , assign glass give . Adaptation 1 : - Starting Day 1 , 3 7 day , subject ask work front computer least 4 hour day assign treatment 1 . Visit 2 : Lab test treatment 1 - On day day 4 day 8 convenient subject , subject come lab assign glass condition . - Baseline measurement take , follow visual task 3 view condition . Subject ask fill VSS , give break , test another round task different view condition . - The total testing time 70 minute condition 4 hour complete visit . - The lab test procedure describe . - At end visit 2 , treatment alternate another 3-7 day adaptation . Adaptation 2 treatment 2 : - Starting day Visit 2 test , subject adapt second treatment ( Gunnar glass without glass ) another 3 7 day . Visit 3 : Lab test treatment 2 - The procedure Visit 2 repeat . - Subject ask rate preference wear Gunnar Glasses no-glasses perform computer task . - After visit , study complete subject . Details lab test procedure : - The study adopt crossover design . Each subject go three view condition ( control , bright light , strong ventilating ) base Latin Square order . 1 . In control condition , subject perform task regular office lighting ( 500 lux ) default lab ventilation condition . 2 . In bright light condition , ambient light increase 1500 lux . 3 . In strong ventilation condition , ceiling fan position top subject ceiling light location increase air flow . Visual performance task : - Baseline measurement ( 10 min ) : Upon arrival , subject ask fill VSS OSDI . Measurements dry eye condition , pupil size , accommodation status , blink rate take baseline visit . - Under view condition 1 : 1 . Visual task ( 60 minute ) : Visual acuity , contrast sensitivity , color perception , visual search number among number matrix , low-contrast target search , text reading , spell check perform fixed order . 2 . Post-task measurement dry eye measure ( Tear break time ) , pupil size , accommodation , blink rate well VSS take . - Break time 5-10 minute . - Repeat procedure two view condition . - Total time one lab visit 4 hour .</detailed_description>
