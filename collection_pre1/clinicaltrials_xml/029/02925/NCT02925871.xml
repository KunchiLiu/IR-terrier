	<brief_summary>There strong evidence early support discharge continue rehabilitation home ( ESD ) deliver interdisciplinary team reduces deaths dependency activity daily live stroke . Despite recommendation national guideline ESD implement place Sweden . There interdisciplinary team supply rehabilitation home coordinate transition lack . Such rehabilitation evidence base . The key component coordinate transition achieve benefit ESD know . The aim design , implement evaluate new person-centred transition stroke unit home achieve full ESD . The development person-centred transition perform together people stroke , significant others , stroke unit staff interdisciplinary team . Phase 1 , prospective observational study current transition stroke unit rehabilitation home without coordination . The aim identify factor facilitator barrier transition , patient caregiver outcome , use health care first year stroke . In phase 2 , co-design process new person-centred transition carry people stroke , significant others , stroke unit staff interdisciplinary home rehabilitation team . In phase 3 new person-centred transition implement form full ESD service evaluate cluster randomise control trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Missing Link- Development Evaluation Person-centred Transitions From Stroke Unit Home</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Project description A phase approach , recommend development evaluation complex intervention , use . In phase 1 current transition stroke unit home environment explore facilitator / barrier coordinate person-centred safe transition identify . Knowledge generate phase 1 inform phase 2 ; co-design process new coordinate person-centred transition conduct people stroke , significant others staff stroke unit interdisciplinary home rehabilitation team together . Knowledge phase 1 phase 2 inform phase 3 ; implementation evaluation miss link . Phase 1 Aims : Explore current state transition combine rehabilitation home , identify facilitator barrier person-centred transition , current patient caregiver outcome , satisfaction , resource use health service first year stroke . 1 . Design : prospective longitudinal observational study . Participants : people mild/moderate stroke , refer stroke unit home rehabilitation significant others ask participate discharge stroke unit . Power calculation indicate inclusion 300 participant stroke . Data collection : Baseline data medical socio-demographic aspect function collect medical record . Data satisfaction transition process collect Care Transition Measure ( CTM ) discharge stroke unit . At 3 , 12 month people stroke assess regard disability , perceive impact stroke , participation social activity , health relate quality life , perceive need health service satisfaction service receive use reliable validated measure structure interview . Data caregiver burden , life satisfaction informal care collect significant others . Data use health care obtain register Stockholms Läns Landsting . Analyses : Statistical analysis identify factor baseline associate satisfactory transition ( CTM ) , association perceive quality transition ( CTM ) patient significant outcomes 3 12 month . 2 . Data : Medical record review planning decision regard transition e.g. , criterion referral home rehabilitation , time planning , information exchange stroke unit interdisciplinary home rehabilitation team , use decision support . Analyses : Quantitative content analyses.c ) Participants : staff stroke unit interdisciplinary home rehabilitation team . Data collection : Focus group interview staff stroke unit experience identify candidate home rehabilitation , plan decision ; interdisciplinary team experience preparation rehabilitation home establish new contact people refer home rehabilitation . Analyses : Thematic analysis constant comparison . ) Participants : Strategic sample people stroke base satisfaction transition significant others . Data collection : Semistructured individual interview experience transition stroke unit home initiation home rehabilitation . Analyses : Thematic analysis constant comparison . Phase 2 Aims : Create prototype new person-centred coordinate safe transition process . Design : Workshops stakeholder use collaborative design process include reflection , analysis , description problem , visualization get common picture , model and/or prototyping . Participants : People stroke , significant others , staff stroke unit interdisciplinary home rehabilitation team series five workshop . Data collection : field-notes , diary documentation design process . The design process comprise six phase : 1 . Engage ; establish relationship participant . 2 . Plan ; generate idea goal . 3 . Explore ; learn experience transition stroke unit home . 4 . Develop ; turn idea context specific improvement . 5 . Decide ; choose improvement make , make . 6 . Change ; put decide improvement action i.e. , phase 3 . The improvement may involve decision support staff , patient significant others information support without support information technology . Phase 3 Aims : Implement new transition stroke unit home , ) evaluate new person-centred transition stroke unit home rehabilitation compare transition without coordination feasibility cluster randomise control trial regard satisfaction transition , patient caregiver outcome use health care first year stroke explore experience new transition stakeholder involve . Design : ) Cluster randomize control feasibility study . Interdisciplinary home rehabilitation team collaborate participate stroke unit Karolinska University hospital Danderyd hospital randomise deliver either new person-centred transition initiation rehabilitation home usual . Based core aspect person-centred transition identify phase I phase 2 transition design develop phase 2 interface coordinate transition stroke-unit interdisciplinary team identify organise . Participants : people mild moderate stroke , refer receive rehabilitation home participate stroke unit , significant others , staff participate stroke unit interdisciplinary team . Data satisfaction transition process collect CTM discharge stroke unit . At 3 , 12 month people stroke assess regard disability , perceive impact stroke , participation social activity , health relate quality life , perceive need health service satisfaction service receive use reliable validated measure structure interview . Data caregiver burden , life satisfaction informal care collect significant others . Data use health care obtain register Stockholms Läns Landsting . Analyses compare outcome people receive new person-centred transition transition usual perform intention treat . Analyses include health economic aspect new transition . b ) In addition , open end question ask participant stroke significant others pertain experience new person-centred transition rehabilitation home environment . Members participate interdisciplinary team staff participate stroke unit interview regard experience . The answer audio record transcribed verbatim . Analyses : Thematic apply analysis use constant comparison apply transcript interview identify experience ESD specifically person-centred transition staff stroke unit participate interdisciplinary team .</detailed_description>
