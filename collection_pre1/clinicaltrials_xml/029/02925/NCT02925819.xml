	<brief_summary>The objective study collect prospective registry case French patient undergoing assessment percutaneous treatment mitral valve disease native valve due deterioration surgical valve repair replacement . In patient , valvular surgery consider contra-indicated prohibitive risk . This registry evaluate morbidity mortality 24 month patient severe mitral valve disease include clinical trial . The association demographic , clinical , laboratory , echocardiographic variable treatment option morbidity mortality evaluate univariate multivariate analysis .</brief_summary>
