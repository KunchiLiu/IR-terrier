	<criteria>Participants must Stage IV , locally advanced metastatic ( T4b , N ; T , N23 ) urothelial bladder cancer transitional cell carcinoma ( TCC ) arise another location urinary tract , include urethra , ureter , renal pelvis . The diagnosis must histologically cytologically confirm . Mixed histology permit long TCC major component ( i.e . &gt; 50 % pathologic specimen ) . Pure predominant squamous cell carcinoma adenocarcinoma permit . Relapsed refractory one two prior line chemotherapy advance metastatic/recurrent disease ( least one cycle ) include PDL1 FGFR inhibitor . At least one regimen include platinum agent unless contraindicate subject . Prior neoadjuvant adjuvant chemotherapy ( without PDL1 FGFR inhibitor ) permit counted firstline chemotherapy , long subject progress within 12 month last dose . However , regimen neoadjuvant adjuvant chemotherapy count firstline chemotherapy patient progress within 12 month last dose . Age ≥ 18 year Eastern cooperative oncology group ( ECOG ) performance status ≤ 1 ( Karnofsky ≥ 60 % ) Participants must normal organ marrow function define : leukocyte ≥ 3000/mcL absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1500/mcL platelet ≥ 75,000/mcL hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL ≥ 5.6 mmol/L total bilirubin within normal institutional limit EXCEPTION : Subjects know Gilbert 's disease : total bilirubin ≤ 3 × institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase ( SGOT ) /Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 × institutional ULN EXCEPTION : Subjects document liver metastasis : AST and/or ALT ≤ 5 × institutional ULN creatinine within normal institutional limit OR creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 participant creatinine level institutional normal ( derive CockcroftGault formula [ Cockcroft 1976 ] ) albumin ≥ 2.5 mg/dL prothrombin time/international normalize ratio ( PT/INR ) partial thromboplastin time ( PTT ) ≤ 1.5 × institutional ULN Note : Screening lab perform within 10 day treatment initiation . Absence psychological , familial , sociological , geographical condition potentially hamper compliance study protocol followup schedule ( condition discuss subject study entry ) The effect B701 develop human fetus unknown . For reason PD1 inhibitor pembrolizumab may potentially cause fetal harm , woman childbearing potential ( define surgically sterilize free menses &gt; 1 year ) men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Men treat enrol protocol must also agree use adequate contraception prior study , duration study participation , 4 month completion study drug administration . Female childbearing potential negative urine serum pregnancy test within 72 hour prior receive first dose study medication . If urine test positive confirm negative , serum pregnancy test require . Female childbearing potential must willing use 2 method birth control surgically sterile , abstain heterosexual activity course study 4 month last dose study medication . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document Participants chemotherapy , target small molecule therapy , radiotherapy within 2 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 2 week earlier . Participants receive , receive , investigational drug device within 2 week prior first dose study medication . Participants receive major surgery must recover adequately toxicity and/or complication intervention prior start therapy . Participants diagnosis immunodeficiency receive systemic steroid therapy ( &gt; 5 mg prednisone equivalent ) form immunosuppressive therapy within 7 day prior first dose study treatment . Participants primary central nervous system ( CNS ) malignancy , untreated/active CNS metastasis ( progress require anticonvulsant corticosteroid symptomatic control ) . Individuals history treat CNS metastasis eligible , provide meet follow criterion : Evaluable measurable disease outside CNS Radiographic demonstration stability upon completion CNS direct therapy evidence interim progression ( least 4 week prior first dose study drug ) completion CNSdirected therapy screen radiographic procedure The screening CNS radiographic procedure ≥ 8 week since completion radiotherapy ≥ 4 week since discontinuation corticosteroid anticonvulsant Note : These exception include carcinomatous meningitis exclude regardless clinical stability . Participants history allergic reaction attribute monoclonal antibody therapy ( recombinant antibodyrelated fusion protein ) Participants active autoimmune disease require systemic treatment ( &gt; 5 mg prednisone equivalent ) past 2 year ( i.e . use disease modify agent , corticosteroid , immunosuppressive drug ) . Replacement therapy ( eg. , thyroxine , insulin , physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy adrenal pituitary insufficiency , etc . ) consider form systemic treatment . Participants know evidence active , noninfectious pneumonitis . Participants active infection require systemic therapy . Participants receive live vaccine within 30 day plan start study therapy . Note : Seasonal influenza vaccine injection generally inactivate flu vaccine allow ; however intranasal influenza vaccine ( e.g. , FluMist® ) live attenuate vaccine , allow . Participants prior anticancer monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) within 2 week prior Cycle 1 Day 1 recover ( i.e. , ≤ Grade 1 baseline ) adverse event due agent administer 2 week earlier . Participants unwilling unable discontinue use prohibit therapy , include cytotoxic chemotherapy , radiotherapy , immunotherapy biologic agent ( approved investigational ) treatment TCC ineligible . Participants uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Participants undergone major surgical procedure trauma within 4 week prior Cycle 1 , Day 1 . All wound must fully heal Cycle 1 , Day 1 Participants history malignancy could affect compliance protocol interpretation result . Individuals history curatively treat basal squamous cell carcinoma skin situ carcinoma cervix allow . Participants malignancy treat curative intent also allow malignancy remission without treatment ≥ 2 year prior Cycle 1 , Day 1 . Pregnant woman exclude study risk B701 unknown pembrolizumab PD1 inhibitor potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother B701 pembrolizumab , breastfeed discontinue . Women childbearing potential must agree use adequate birth control throughout study duration . Hepatitis B , hepatitis C , HIV serologypositive ( know history HIV seropositive status ) participant ineligible underlying disease confound interpretation important safety assessment , e.g . liver function test , increase potential reactivation exacerbation viral infection . Such individual may take require drug , may high risk opportunistic infection adverse effect . Hepatitis B , hepatitis C , HIV serologypositive individual exclude pivotal pembrolizumab clinical trial melanoma , safety drug set unknown . Known active bacterial , viral , fungal , mycobacterial , parasitic , infection ( exclude fungal infection nail bed ) screen major episode infection require treatment IV antibiotic hospitalization ( relate completion course antibiotic ) within 4 week prior Cycle 1 , Day 1 Has know history active TB ( Bacillus Tuberculosis ) Participants weigh &gt; 110 kg ineligible due study drug limitation</criteria>
