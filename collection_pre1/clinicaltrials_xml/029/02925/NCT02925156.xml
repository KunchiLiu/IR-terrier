	<brief_summary>This project examine whether individual ' amount activity energy expenditure ( AEE ) relate adiposity adiposity/diabetes-related hormone diverse sample 2500 , test ecological hypothesis decline level AEE important cause increase obesity currently take place many society . One goal use doubly label water and/or accelerometer objectively measure activity energy expenditure community sample five adult population across spectrum obesity risk . From site , ( i.e. , Ghana , South Africa , Seychelles , Jamaica , US ) , 500 black adult recruit . Among participant , AEE measure use accelerometer subset 75 per site , AEE also measure doubly labeled water . The doubly labeled water sample use confirm site-specific concordance accelerometer measurement estimate population mean level AEE . Additionally , body composition , dietary intake , fast glucose , insulin , adiponectin , leptin ghrelin measure . The relationships calorie expend activity body composition , dietary intake , glucose , hormone adipocytokines , within population use doubly label water accelerometer examine . In longitudinal study , weight measure 12 24-months , AEE accelerometer assess enrollment 2-years follow-up ; association change AEE change weight estimate . The central purpose project test whether AEE change AEE identify contributory mechanism population-wide weight gain , , quantify importance . In addition , seek understand interrelationship adipocytokines hormone ghrelin insulin well AEE regulation body weight across continuum body mass index ( BMI ) represent five population .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Modeling Epidemiologic Transition Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Populations world experience rapid increase prevalence obesity diabetes . To date , public health response emerge obesity epidemic almost totally ineffective . As first line response , professional body government organization issue prevention guideline , include recommendation level activity energy expenditure ( AEE ) . However , even fully implement , clear current recommendation AEE would impact trend age-related weight gain . In fact , virtually direct evidence bring bear question whether obesity epidemic result primarily even partially society-wide decline habitual physical activity ( PA ) . To date , epidemiologic research AEE rely crude measurement toolsâ€”primarily questionnaire . These self-reported data capture small fraction total variance activity potentially confound focus leisure-time PA. By contrast , direct measurement doubly label water ( DLW ) provide precise , unbiased estimate form non-resting energy expenditure . DLW also use validate new generation accelerometer efficient measurement tool large study . In study , objective measurement tool use examine `` ecology AEE '' . This study take place 5 country span range activity-obesity spectrum combine within-population person-level between-population ecological analysis . First , study examine whether individual 's amount pattern AEE related adiposity diverse sample 2,500 . Second , study evaluate whether decline level AEE important cause rapid increase obesity currently take place many society . As exploratory aim examine role select adipocytokines appetite hormone ghrelin .</detailed_description>
