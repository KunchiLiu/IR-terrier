	<brief_summary>This study healthy adult volunteer give either experimental Malaria vaccine saline control vaccine . Each volunteer receive three vaccination total . Volunteers randomly allocate one three group : Group 1 receive low dose Malaria vaccine day 0 , 28 , 56 . Group 2 receive high dose Malaria vaccine day 0 , 28 , 56 .

	<brief_title>A Study Assess Safety Immunogenicity Malaria Vaccine , R21 , With Matrix-M1 Adjuvant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomise , control , single-blind clinical trial evaluate safety immunogenicity malaria vaccine candidate regime three ( 3 ) dose R21/Matrix-M1 compare placebo , healthy West African adult volunteer live malaria-endemic area . The study take place Centre National de Recherche et de Formation sur la Paludisme ( CNRFP ) /Unite de Recherche Clinique de Banfora ( URC-B ) . Trial participant draw Banfora Health Demographic system , cover total population 30 , 000 . Community sensitisation undertaken engage community study recruit volunteer participation study . The CNRFP study team hold local community meeting explain study potentially eligible adult volunteer . During meeting investigator explain follow : need vaccine ; current status vaccine development ( include fact likely prolonged process ) ; study screening inform consent procedure ; risk vaccination unproven benefit vaccination . It stress experimental vaccine regimen guarantee provide protection , therefore still necessary seek treatment possible malaria even vaccination continue use protective measure bed net . It explain aid identification , photograph volunteer take eligible enrolled trial . After meeting , base list adult suitable age participation trial drawn DSS database , volunteer ask participate public lottery make randomly select participant invite screen visit . All propose volunteer thus select invited Banfora clinical trial centre screen visit . The Volunteer Information Sheet ( VIS ) contain detailed information study distribute proposed volunteer . The investigator endeavour ensure volunteer fully understand risk . Any volunteer appear less complete understanding consider unable give consent . If unable sign , volunteer ask thumbprint consent form presence impartial witness present screening procedure countersign consent form . Fully consented volunteer undergo full screening procedure . This consist medical history , physical examination , blood sample screen test . Volunteers randomise receive either three ( 3 ) dos R21/ Matrix-M1 placebo ( normal saline ) control . Simple randomisation study group do independent statistician base University Oxford . A randomisation code list generate independent statistician use guide clear Standard Operating Procedure ( SOP ) . Allocation concealment employ use opaque seal envelope . As single-blind clinical trial design , laboratory scientist blind vaccine allocation end study . Each volunteer monitor one hour ( longer necessary ) vaccination . Each volunteer visit home daily 6 day vaccination ( Days 0 , 28 , 56 ) field worker assessment record solicit unsolicited AEs diary card . If necessary volunteer continue see regularly observe AEs resolve stabilise . Scheduled visit CNRFP Days 0 , 7 , 28 , 35 , 56 , 63 , 84 , 140 . All volunteer follow Day 140 post-first vaccination adverse event .</detailed_description>

Willing pregnancy test screen vaccination time point . Agreement refrain blood donation course study . Written inform consent participate trial . The volunteer may enter study follow apply : Hb le 10.0g/dl Receipt investigational product 30 day precede enrolment , plan receipt study period . Prior receipt investigational malaria vaccine investigational vaccine likely impact interpretation trial data . Any confirm suspected immunosuppressive immunodeficient state , include HIV infection ; asplenia ; recurrent severe infection chronic ( 14 day ) immunosuppressant immunemodifying drug medication ( corticosteroid , mean prednisolone , equivalent , â‰¥ 0.5mg/kg/day ) within past 6 month ( inhaled topical steroid allow ) . Use immunoglobulins blood product within 3 month prior enrolment . History allergic disease hypersensitivity reaction likely exacerbate component study vaccine . Any history anaphylaxis postvaccination . History clinically significant contact dermititis . Pregnancy , lactation intention become pregnant study . Disturbances electrolyte balance , e.g . hypokalaemia hypomagnesaemia . History cancer ( except basal cell carcinoma skin cervical carcinoma situ ) . History serious psychiatric condition may affect participation study . History splenectomy . Any serious chronic illness require hospital specialist supervision . HIV Hepatitis B surface antigen seropositivity . Volunteers unable closely follow social , geographic psychological reason . Any clinically significant abnormal find biochemistry haematology blood test , urinalysis clinical examination . In event abnormal test result , confirmatory repeat test request . Any significant disease , disorder , find may significantly increase risk volunteer participation study , affect ability volunteer participate study impair interpretation study data .</criteria>
