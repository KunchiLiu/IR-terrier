	<brief_summary>The main study objective determine whether 24/7 automate closed-loop glucose control combine low glucose feature improve glucose control measure HbA1c . This open-label , multi-centre , multi-national , single-period , randomise , parallel group design study , involve 12 month period home study day night glucose level control either closed-loop system combine low glucose feature ( intervention group ) insulin pump therapy alone ( control group ) . It expect total 150 subject ( aim 130 randomised subject ) type 1 diabetes recruit paediatric outpatient diabetes clinic investigation centre . Participants subcutaneous insulin pump therapy . Subjects intervention group proven competency use study insulin pump study continuous glucose monitoring ( CGM ) device , receive appropriate training safe use closed-loop insulin delivery system low glucose feature . All subject regular contact study team home study phase include 24/7 telephone support . The primary outcome group difference HbA1c level 12 month post study arm initiation . Secondary outcome time spend glucose target ( 3.9 10.0mmol/l ; 70 180mg/dl ) , time spend glucose level target , record CGM , CGM-based metric . Safety evaluation comprises assessment frequency severe hypoglycaemic episode diabetic ketoacidosis ( DKA ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Purpose study : To determine whether 24/7 automate closed-loop glucose control improve glucose control measure glycated haemoglobin reduce burden hypoglycaemia compare insulin pump therapy alone . - Study Objectives : 1 . EFFICACY : The objective ass efficacy day night automate closed-loop glucose control improve glucose control measure glycated haemoglobin , compare insulin pump therapy alone . 2 . SAFETY : The objective evaluate safety day night automate closed-loop glucose control , term episodes severe hypoglycaemia adverse event . 3 . UTILITY : The objective determine frequency duration use automate closed-loop system . 4 . HUMAN FACTORS : The objective ass cognitive , emotional , behavioural characteristic participate subject family member response closed-loop system clinical trial use validated survey focus group . 5 . HEALTH ECONOMICS : The objective perform cost utility analysis inform reimbursement decision-making . - Study Design : An open-label , multi-centre , randomised , single-period parallel study , contrast day-and-night automate closed-loop glucose control insulin pump therapy alone . - Population : 130 participant randomise ( equal proportion age 6 12 year 13 18 year , minimum quota 25 % participant baseline HbA1c &gt; 8.5 % ) - Maximum duration study subject : 14 month - Recruitment : The subject recruit pediatric outpatient clinic center . - Consent : Written consent / assent obtain participant and/or guardian accord REC / IRB requirement - Screening Assessments : Eligible participant undergo screen evaluation blood sample full blood count , liver , thyroid function anti-transglutaminase antibody ( IgA level do within previous 12 month ) take . Non-hypoglycaemia C-peptide , glucose HbA1c also measure , urine pregnancy test females child-bearing potential performed . Surveys investigate participant ' quality life , psychosocial cognitive functioning , response current treatment distribute . Participants fit blind continuous glucose monitoring ( CGM ) device ass baseline glycaemic control . Instructions safely use , remove send back device provide . - Study Training : Training session use study CGM , insulin pump ( close loop system randomize intervention group ) provide research team . Training session use real-time CGM interpret real-time retrospective store data provide subject / carers use write material . - Run-In Period : During 1-2 week run-in period , subject continue use insulin pump . Data obtain blind CGM pump downloads may utilised therapy adjustment . - Competency Assessment : Competency use study insulin pump study CGM evaluate use competency assessment tool develop research team . Further training may deliver require . - Randomization : Eligible subject randomise use randomisation software use real-time CGM low glucose feature combine day night closed-loop conventional insulin pump therapy alone . A blood sample take measurement HbA1c urine pregnancy test females child-bearing potential . A blood sample centralise analysis HbA1c take screen randomisation &gt; 28 day apart . 1 . Automated day night closed-loop insulin delivery ( intervention arm ) combine low glucose feature ( interventional arm ) - Participants closed-loop group receive additional training session follow randomisation cover use study insulin pump real-time CGM , prior start closed-loop insulin delivery . Once confident use study pump CGM system , participant receive training require safe effective use closed-loop system approximately 2-4 week randomisation . During 2-4 hour session participant operate system supervision clinical team . Competency use closed-loop system evaluate . Thereafter , participant expect use closed-loop 12 month without direct real-time remote monitoring . 2 . Insulin pump therapy ( control arm ) - Refresher train key aspect insulin pump therapy provide . Subjects continue use insulin pump 12 month . - 3-month , 6-month , 9-month 12 month assessment : 1 . A blood sample take measurement HbA1c . 2 . Validated survey evaluate impact device employ quality life , psychosocial cognitive functioning , diabetes management treatment satisfaction complete . 3 . Participants study arm fit blind CGM system end follow visit . The sensor wear home 14 day send back research team . 12 month : Subjects/guardians invite join follow-up focus group gather feedback reaction current treatment ( closed-loop insulin pump ) , clinical trial , quality life change . - Study Contacts : In study visit , participant contact study team ( email phone ) monthly order record adverse event , device deficiency , change insulin setting , medical condition and/or medication . In case technical device problem relate diabetes management hypo- hyperglycaemia , subject able contact 24-hour telephone helpline local research team time . The local research team access central 24 hour advice technical issue . -- Procedures safety monitor trial : Standard operate procedure monitor report adverse event place , include serious adverse event ( SAE ) , serious adverse device effect ( SADE ) specific adverse event ( AE ) severe hypoglycaemia . Subjects ask test record blood ketone finger prick glucose 14.0mmol/l ( 250mg/dl ) , part safety assessment hyperglycaemia . A data safety monitor board ( DSMB ) inform serious adverse event unanticipated serious adverse device effect occur study review compile adverse event data periodic interval . -- Criteria withdrawal patient safety ground : A subject , parent , guardian may terminate participation study time without necessarily give reason without personal disadvantage . An investigator stop closed-loop intervention consideration benefit/risk ratio . Possible reason : 1 . Serious adverse event 2 . Significant protocol violation non-compliance 3 . Failure satisfy competency assessment 4 . Decision investigator , sponsor , termination subject 's best medical interest 5 . Pregnancy , plan pregnancy , breast feeding 6 . Allergic reaction insulin Efforts make retain subject follow final primary outcome assessment even intervention discontinue , unless investigator believe harmful subject continue trial .</detailed_description>
