	<brief_title>Maternal Dietary Lipids Omega 3 Essential Fatty Acids Profile Pregnant Women Term Their Fetuses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>DHA ( Docosahexaenoic Acid ) long chain omega-3 fatty acid important brain eye development function throughout life . It also support heart health . DHA abundant omega-3 brain retina naturally find breast milk . EPA ( Eicosapentaenoic Acid ) long-chain omega-3 fatty acid important overall health . However , unlike DHA , body store EPA significant quantity brain retina ( DHA find every cell throughout body , EPA ) . These Omega 3 fatty acid consider essential due inability human body create need consume nutritional source . Food consider rich omega 3 fatty acid fat fish green vegetable . Omega-3 fatty acid `` good fat , '' among important nutrient lack Western diet today . The average person developed country consume less 100 mg DHA daily . With increase awareness importance DHA , many people realize need make change diet add DHA-rich food supplement . Alpha Linolenic Acid ( ALA ) shorter-chain omega-3 serf source energy build block long-chain omega-3 fatty acid ( DHA EPA ) . This precursor omega 3 fatty acid abundant falx seed . The mother fetus metabolic mechanism enable transform ALA EPA , DHA endogenously . Women pregnancy predispose reduction unsaturated long chain fatty acid ( polyunsaturated Fatty Acid = PUFA ) omega 3 group . Lately , new hypothesis claiming reduce level essential acid expose fetus later adult life spectrum metabolic cardiovascular disease . New publication animal model show high rate obesity , insulin resistance diabetes cardiovascular damage mouse expose short chain fatty acid compare treat enriched ALA diet supplementation . Different nutritional gynecological health organization around world include FDA , recommend incorporate omega 3 fatty acid supplementation daily diet specifically pregnant woman order raise blood level develop fetus . However , normal fatty acid profile omega 3 group mother fetus n't describe yet . Furthermore , total effect future benefit fetus n't thoroughly study base mainly presumption . The aim study learn typical omega 3 fatty acid profile woman near delivery fetus compare woman productive year pregnant . Study method : Women close term visit obstetrical triage fit inclusion criterion offer participate study . Demographic medical obstetrical information collect medical file give sign informed consent . Blood sample ( one blood tube include 5 cc blood ) take insertion intravenous line delivery room , another blood sample take umbilical vein delivery separation fetus umbilical cord . Women control group - healthy non pregnant woman fertility year , recruit gynecological clinic . Similarly study group , one study researcher collect one tube blood sampling ( equal 5 cc blood ) . All sample send profile analysis omega 3 fatty acid .</detailed_description>
