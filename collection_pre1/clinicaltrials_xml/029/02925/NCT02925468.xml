	<brief_summary>The correction deep overbite assume involve incisor intrusion extrusion eruption premolars molar . The latter also assume major contributor grow patient vertical facial growth increase accommodate additional eruption posterior teeth anterior bite plane appliance . In study nature rate adaptation occlusal change follow insertion fix anterior bite plane reduction deep overbite grow patient investigate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All subject meet inclusion criterion inform study write consent sought participation . Subjects recruit new patient clinic routine treatment wait list . A standard initial lateral cephalogram take subject , unless already available within specify age range . Active growth determine use Bacetti CVM method . For Intervention group - intra-oral scanner use accurately record occlusal relationship prior insertion fix anterior bite plane ( T0 ) repeat immediately placement ( T1 ) . Each subject re-scanned six weekly basis period six month ( T2-T5 ) . Conventional clinical photograph three-dimensional stereophotogrammetry use assess vertical facial relationship T0-T5 . A lateral cephalogram take T5 assess skeletal change ass evidence intrusion eruption well determine alteration incisor inclination . A control group subject treatment wait list meet inclusion criterion use . An intra-oral scanner record baseline occlusal relationship ( T0 ) repeat six month ( T5 ) . The control group also standard pre-treatment lateral cephalogram take , well conventional three-dimensional stereophotogrammetry baseline ( T0 ) six month ( T5 ) . This allow change result growth assess whilst active orthodontic treatment take place . The primary outcome assessed nature change occlusal-vertical dimension rate occlusal adaptation relation facial growth change . The intra-oral scan photograph analyse use three-dimensional technology determine immediate change resultant occlusal adaptation change lower face height six weekly basis six month . All subject guardian intervention group ask complete short questionnaire immediately visit T1 T5 . This assess experience 3-D scanning bite plane ( applicable ) . We also assess knowledge overbite definition , process overbite reduction effect increase overbite oral health . The control group ask complete questionnaire T0 . The economic impact manage increase overbite initial phase treatment versus single phase comprehensive treatment investigate . A cost analysis perform investigate economic difference use bite turbos versus removable appliance reduce overbite .</detailed_description>
