	<brief_title>MRI Normal Ileal Pouches , Feasibility Study Dynamic MRI Enema Defaecating MRI Pouchography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ulcerative Colitis Ulcerative Colitis ( UC ) common inflammatory bowel disease , approximately 146,000 sufferer UK ( NICE , 2011 ) . Unlike inflammatory bowel disease , inflammation UC affect large bowel , start rectum extend proximally ( towards mouth end gut ) . Three four patient manage medical treatment acceptable control disease , patient may require surgical removal large bowel several reason . The one four patient colon remove ( colectomy ) either need emergency operation infection , perforation bleeding , plan operation failure medical management , intolerance medication , cancer steroid dependence ( 1 ) . Because inflammation confine colon , surgery curative . Having remove large bowel , option regard end remain small bowel , ileum . In 1978 Professor Sir Alan Parks Professor John Nicholls publicise operation 'restorative proctocolectomy ' ( RPC ) fold suture together loop small bowel create 'pouch ' take reservoir function rectum , give patient chance continence without need stoma ( 2,3 ) . This operation become extremely popular last 38 year , consider internationally gold standard 'restorative proctocolectomy ' patient choose permanent stoma ( 4 ) . The operation refine year since 's introduction ( 5 ) , roughly two third patient enjoy acceptable function . However , complication associate create RPC ; notably pelvic sepsis , fistula , poor mechanical function inflammation , mean cumulative rate pouch failure roughly 5 % five year , 15 % 15 year ( Ryoo et al . 2014 ; Remzi et al . 2015 ; Sherman et al . 2014 ; R. et al . 2012 ; Papadopoulos et al . 2010 ) . Pouch-Related Septic Complications St Mark 's Hospital one large UK cohort patient RPCs , tertiary referral centre pouch complication . Of reason pouch failure , chronic pelvic sepsis major cause , 50 60 % . This long term infection pelvis around near pouch , cause inflammation poor function . The pouch may become inflamed , know pouchitis , cause unknown , hypothesised inflammation cause change type bacteria present pouch oppose small bowel normal continuity . Generally speak , management pelvic sepsis cause pouch function surgically radiologically drain pelvic collection , eventually surgically remove pouch . The management pouchitis ( primary idiopathic pouchitis ) primarily antibiotic , prolonged case antibiotic ineffective may patient 's benefit treat inflammation steroid 'biologic ' medication . These medication act suppress body 's innate immune response , would inappropriate use medication true cause inflammation ongoing sepsis pelvis infection would likely become significantly bad , cause systemic infection ( sepsis ) . Unpublished research St Mark 's complete end 2015 http : //scripties.umcg.eldoc.ub.rug.nl/root/geneeskunde/2016/PloegVvander/ show 68 patient treated primary idiopathic pouchitis , 38 % incidental pre-sacral collection identify MRI , potentially consistent pelvic sepsis drive inflammation , rather inflammation rise primarily pouch . Five patient go drainage pelvic sepsis , resolution symptom one . Therefore , base series , significance pre-sacral collection MRI context pouchitis unknown . Beyond , know often find may present 'normal variant ' patient normal functioning pouch . The propose trial would help guide clinical management patient pouchitis pre-sacral collection . Pouch Evacuatory Dysfunction A different type problem ileal pouch inability easily evacuate pouch . The majority patient normally function pouch , pressure open bowel felt like people normal anatomy . Some patient difficulty evacuate pouch , often without obvious inflammatory anatomical cause . These patient often investigate defaecating pouchography , investigation use move x-ray image radio-opaque contrast material evacuate patient . A study conduct St Mark 's publish August 2016 ( 11 ) demonstrate investigation relatively poor diagnostic value , partly due fact establish range normal finding . Using move MRI image patient normal anatomy ( call MRI defaecating proctography ) replacing use x-ray moving image ( fluoroscopy ) much , great detail image , radiation exposure patient . This study would pilot trial use defaecating MRI patient pouch , ( defaecating MRI pouchography ) establish whether technique translate patient pouch instead rectum , establish range normal finding go utilise technique patient evacuatory dysfunction . This technique yet describe medical literature .</detailed_description>
