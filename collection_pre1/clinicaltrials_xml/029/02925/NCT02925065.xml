	<detailed_description>PROBLEM STATEMENT : Engagement musical activity find improve symptoms individual Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) , physical therapy music therapy demonstrate viable non-pharmacological intervention method improve motor function individual . Therapeutic instrumental music performance attribute physical , rhythmic social engagement combine immediate auditory feedback , potential bring additional neuro-rehabilitative effect associate musical engagement treatment design . However , , much research focus rhythmic aspect music . Few study examine active complex engagement music , learn play instrument , may help PD patient . Finger-style guitar instruction potential improve bilateral dexterity addition gain report music-based intervention patient PD . PURPOSE : The purpose pilot control prospective cohort study assess feasibility effect non-traditional finger-style guitar class quality life , motor symptom , upper extremity function , cognition , mood social participation individual PD . HYPOTHESIS : The investigator hypothesize 6-week bi-weekly finger-style guitar group intervention ( 12 session total ) addition usual routine treatment feasible intervention patient Parkinson 's Disease ( PD ) , result significant gain quality life , mood , social engagement , upper extremity function upper extremity dexterity compare control receive usual routine treatment . IMPORTANCE : The estimate overall prevalence PD world 315 per 100,000 individual overall , 2 per 100 individual 60 year age old , high estimate older individual live North America , Europe Australia ( Pringsheim , Jette , Frolkis , &amp; Steeves , 2014 ) . PD prevalence United States project rise 77 % 2010 2030 ( Dorsey et . al. , 2013 ) . Music rhythm-based intervention noninvasive , patient-oriented technique lack side effect . The guitar popular play instrument U.S ( Richard K Miller Associates , 2012 ) , principal instrument choice music therapist ( Krout , 2007 ) . It affordable portable , easy access commercial instruction . Non-traditional engagement finger-style music make guitar may broad impact PD improve quality functional upper extremity movement , decrease amplitude involuntary movement , increase social cognitive participation activity daily live , improve quality life .</detailed_description>
