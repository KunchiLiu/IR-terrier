	<brief_title>Safety , Tolerability , PK PD Posiphen® Subjects With Early Alzheimer 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Posiphen® , discover US National Institute Aging ( NIA ) selective inhibitor amyloid precursor protein ( APP ) production potential utility disease modify treatment AD . The present study confirm pharmacokinetics ( PK ) Posiphen metabolites plasma cerebral spinal fluid ( CSF ) . It also measure effect 23-25 day treatment period Posiphen CSF plasma level number biomarkers , inflammatory factor control proteins . It also expand safety data human extend treatment period 10 day treatment period 23-25 day . In addition , study measure concentration various soluble biomarkers CSF use SILK™ assay method directly measure effect Posiphen fractional synthesis rate Aβ40 CSF , help guide development Posiphen determine feasibility SILK™ multicenter trial .</detailed_description>
