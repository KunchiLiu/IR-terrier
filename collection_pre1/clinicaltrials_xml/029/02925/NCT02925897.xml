	<brief_summary>The prevalence people live problem due long-term condition ( LTC ) heart disease , diabetes arthritis England exceed 15 million , number one LTC continue grow ( LTCs ) . This population consume large proportion health service resource . Advancing age LTCs increase likelihood become housebound , detrimental effect health quality life . Health policy advocate health service model empowerment self-care . People live LTCs often knowledgeable look health find difficult adjust . Motivational technique demonstrate facilitate behaviour change change style communication directive collaborative . The use patient-centred conversational style communication show elicit willingness change professional-led directive consultation . Community nurse unique position influence housebound patient play great part caring , prevent complication long-term condition ill health . This study intend test feasibility acceptability train community nurse Understanding Behaviour Change , communication technique use motivational interview guide patient change behaviour . The opportunistic use motivational technique create participatory relationship patient , community nurse potentially represent effective intervention enable patient LTCs optimise way care . Motivational interview technique widely demonstrate bring behaviour change study context changing style communication housebound patient professional care .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Design Methods This study pragmatic mixed method explanatory design , consist clinical trial qualitative study . The result trial use inform interview protocol qualitative study , data analyse explore elaborate result trial . Phase one : Clinical Trial Design This parallel control , single blind trial . The outcomes patient care nurse undergone UBC compare outcomes patient receive usual care . Population : All patient refer caseload community nursing team consider inclusion trial . If patient community caseload consider housebound time treatment criterion acceptance onto caseload . The criteria infrequent absence home short duration require tax effort use line Medicare definition homebound ( U.S. Department Health Human Services 2010 ) . Blinding : The patient tell whether cared nurse receive UBC training . Randomisation : It intend trial resulting study would random controlled cluster design overcome . All eligible patient one locality expose intervention eligible patient locality expose . Randomising community nursing team level cluster trial could lead contamination , within locality nurse may cover team weekend period staff absence . If feasibility study lead large trial , would possible randomise locality level reduce bias . Non-randomised feasibility study reduce validity ( Craig et al 2008 ) . Setting : This feasibility study plan take place within two neighbour Clinical Commissioning Groups ( CCG ) serve population 335,000 people ( Office National Statistics 2011 ) . The intervention locality nine community nurse team link GP practice group three cluster . The patient usual care arm trial recruit neighbour CCG similar configuration community nursing team , include community matron specialist nurse . All nursing work patient intervention cluster train UBC . Sample : All patient potential participant admit community caseloads . In locality UBC use , patient see nurse expose motivational technique . The participant patient newly consecutively refer caseload either intervention community nurse team control team expect three contact community nurse . Recruitment procedure All patient potential participant meet inclusion criterion . Once identified staff care explain study give information sheet . If interested participate give consent form . They contact next day phone ask willing participate . If willing , next visit , usual carer investigator discus study determine understanding participate . If understand ask sign consent form . Their part trial consist complete questionnaire start 3 month treatment . The questionnaire administer either member care team researcher . The final Questionnaire give member usual care team researcher . The questionnaire administer either face face phone depend participant ' wish . Questionnaires supply envelope encourage candid response . Health service use measure investigator access data electronic record , patient consent , referral three month intervention . Intervention : Understanding Behaviour Change ( UBC ) training . UBC training structure Prevention Lifestyle Behaviour Change : Competency Framework ( National Institute Health Clinical Excellence 2007 ) . The training accredit Royal Society Public Health ( RSPB ) . The training aim enable learner understand behaviour associate active listening , effective hearing , reflect , check understanding use effective communication . UBC training also identify enable approach build relationship , knowledge behaviour change model explore individual 's motivation adopt positive health behaviour . The training enhance trainee ' skill support individual develop strategy enable plan implement change lifestyle health behaviour . The training support role play develop communication skill . Sixteen member staff community nursing team lead , community matron , specialist nurse train motivational champion UBC consist two day face-to-face training . The motivational Champions take multiple-choice exam set external examiner ass knowledge . The remain 20 staff one session four hour train , face-to-face , include role play . The training provide KCHT Improvement Team venue within locality . The champion provide supervision encouragement use UBC Intervention monthly action learn set . The action learn set attend two motivational champion two three staff . This allow staff reflect experience use UBC share learn acquire . To evaluate professional development champion ask complete questionnaire undertake train one month afterwards . This explore knowledge confidence behaviour change barrier facilitator implement learning . Themes questionnaire discuss action learn set . Intervention fidelity All staff assessment patient audiotaped assess researcher use UBC use Peer Proficiency Assessment ( PEPA ) ( Maestroleo et al 2009 ) . This process explain patient first consent part study record take place . The audio-recorder encrypt recording analyse use PEPA tool , investigator , delete . The PEPA tool develop evaluate fidelity use MI skill undergraduate peer counsellor . PEPA valid tool simple use demonstrate high inter-rater reliability master coder , experience peer counsellor minimally train peer counsellor ( Mastroleo et al 2009 ) . Phase two : Interview study Aim : To explore intervention arm patient ' experience service receive , interaction nurse impact ability care . Design : Qualitative Method : An interview protocol develop , inform analysis quantitative data . Interviews allow rich data collect , guide topic heading specific research area . This create flexibility focus depend upon interviewer skill listen actively , reflectively attentively guide control quality data ( Polit &amp; Beck 2008 ) . Each interview expect take hour may shorter , depend wish health individual patient . The interview audio tap permission interviewer take additional anonymised note identify patient unique number . Sample : Six patient intervention group interview rich qualitative data , explore view perception community nurse talked impact care . The sample interview select represent extreme result Consultation relational empathy measure ( Mercer et al 2004 ) . It initially intend interview six participant , important theme difference find may necessary widen inquiry explore phenomenon fully ( Kelly 2010 ) . Analysis : The audiotape transcribe verbatim , investigator agency use medical transcription KCHT , check accuracy interviewer . The transcript share patient check true representation intend meaning . The audio tape delete transcription ; transcript anonymised use patient identification number . The transcript read note take interview mean . They re-read identify theme best capture essential quality interview . Themes within section transcript identify , possible likely connection theme sought . A qualitative code book develop . The data cod code assign label . The code group theme , interrelate assigned small set category . Computer assist data analysis software NVivo use organise support rigorous data analysis ( St John &amp; Johnson 2004 ) . Bias : The researcher , deliver care group patient , interview participant use critical reflexivity , guard personal bias , write memo acknowledge personal preference , theoretical leaning investment research process ( Polit &amp; Beck 2008 ) . Integration quantitative qualitative result : The quantitative data examine data qualitative phase , test refine explanation outcome ( Cresswell &amp; Plano Clark 2012 ) inform design future study .</detailed_description>
