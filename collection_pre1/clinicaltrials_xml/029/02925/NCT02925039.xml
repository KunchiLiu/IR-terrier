	<brief_summary>The sit-to-stand ( STS ) movement key functional movement critical independent living . This movement physically demand conduct , especially old adult , presence physical impairment associate range condition , stroke , osteoarthritis , Parkinson disease hip arthroplasty . A limited capacity perform movement increase risk fall , dependency increase support personal care rehabilitation . Restoring independence movement , therefore , consider priority physical rehabilitation . Sit-to-stand capacity regain participate rehabilitation exercise . Providing feedback performance movement could enhance training . Thus , essential aspect physical therapy . Healthcare provider require meet need increasingly frail population well meet national , evidence-based , guideline improve outcomes condition stroke include increase practice repetition functional movement . Reliance rehabilitation staff provide practice , however , place limit practice volume , potentially restrict outcome . Using technology enhance safe , repetitive practice movement minimal supervision skilled professional would beneficial patient rehabilitation service . The primary aim study test acceptability feasibility STS training system enhance movement feedback patient undergoing rehabilitation . A secondary aim gather data effectiveness system compare conventional rehabilitation . This information inform statistically power phase 2 trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sit-to-stand Exercise Training With Performance Feedback</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research Design : This pilot randomise control study test acceptability feasibility sit-to-stand ( STS ) training system gather preliminary data effectiveness . Participants randomly allocate experimental group participant receive sit stand training enhance feedback system control group participant receive usual sit stand train provide treat therapist . Participants recruitment : Patients physical impairment affect capacity perform STS movement start active rehabilitation identify clinical team ward . If individual identify way indicate clinical team willing talk researcher study mutually convenient time arrange researcher speak individually patient study . An information sheet leave patient encourage read speak family friends possible participation . No le 48 hour information sheet provide , researcher make contact patient discuss participation take write consent agree . This recruitment process participation study interfere discharge plan study . Group allocation : Sealed opaque envelope contain randomly generate code treatment allocation give member clinical team . Once informed consent provide , envelope open randomise participant two group : 1 ) A control group conduct conventional sit-to-stand training 2 ) An experimental group conduct augment STS train use feedback system . Twenty participant randomly allocate group . Participants allocate either group attach physical activity monitor ( ActivePAL sensor , PAL Technologies Ltd , Glasgow ) researcher onto unaffected dominant side thigh . Full instruction provide use . The monitor small lightweight ( &lt; 15 gram ) capable detect store information movement position ( e.g . duration sit , stand number STS execution 24 hour aday 28 day ) .Data record medical note : Participants ' background information ( i.e . gender , age , height , weight , reason admission number type co-morbidities ) noted.Pre-assessments : Participants group ask carry follow baseline measurement researcher : 1 ) Timed performance five repetition sit stand movement ( FTSTST ) , able; 2 ) Abbreviated Mental Test -4 inclusion score 4 high ( AMT-4 ) ; 3 ) Tinetti Gait Balance Assessment ( TGBA ) ; 4 ) Elderly Mobility Scale Test ( EMST ) . These assessment already use clinical team . Training system : The rehabilitation staff supervise training session per normal practice . The researcher provide technical support session . The participant ask sit adjustable chair armrest . The height chair adjust researcher individual need . A loose vest pouch pocket fit near chest region worn participant . Help provide researcher need . An inertial sensor ( Spatial 3/3/3 , Phidgets Inc , Calgary , Alberta , Canada ) place pocket connect USB ( Universal Serial Bus ) cable laptop computer . The participant ask place foot portable balance plate ( BP5046 , Bertec Inc , Columbus , OH , USA ) , also attach laptop via USB . The system provide virtual reality environment simulates user get bus seat . The participant observe real-time movement avatar computerise image ( project wall projector ) . Real-time feedback performance ( balance , strength and/or coordination ) , verbally visually , provide throughout training . The game personalise suit different need base participant 's real-time performance . Training two three time week base advice current practice . During study , researcher check ward staff activity monitor ( ActivePAL ) still attach participant 's thigh free skin irritation . The researcher also change monitor seven day skin fully inspect cleaned necessary . After study , monitor completely remove researcher . The captured anonymised physical activity data download encrypt folder computer use exclusively study . It transfer secure computer University Strathclyde safe storage . Post-assessment : The researcher carry repeat baseline measurement end study . In addition , follow information record researcher acceptability feasibility : 1 ) Number session attend proportion total number session available; 2 ) Adverse incident , type number; 3 ) acceptability system semi-structured interview clinical team participant . The anonymised data analyse address three question : 1 . Is system feasible use old people undergo inpatient rehabilitation ? 2 . Is system feasible use clinical environment ? 3 . Can system improve sit-to-stand performance compare conventional training ? 4 . Is system acceptable point view user ( patient rehabilitation staff ) ?</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1 . Patients admit geriatric rehabilitation ward Gartnavel General ( Greater Glasgow Clyde Health Board ) . 2 . Patients physical impairment affect ability stand sit ( sit stand ) . 3 . Patients medically stable . 4 . Patients able give inform consent . 5 . Patients able complete STS movement with/without help mobility aid assistance one person . 6 . Patients able follow threeword instruction English . Exclusion 1 . Patients unable read feedback computer screen without use visual aid . 2 . Patients known epileptic/photosensitive experience blackout expose certain light pattern flash image . 3 . Patients coexist physical impairment prevent practice sittostand e.g . bilateral amputee acute exacerbation rheumatoid arthritis . 4 . Patients expect survive period study 5 . Patients active dermatological problem may preclude use double side sticky tape . 6 . Patients active medical condition may limit prescribed mobility exercise e.g . unstable angina .</criteria>
