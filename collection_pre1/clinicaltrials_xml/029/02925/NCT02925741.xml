	<detailed_description>Although large amount research publish contribute factor pressure ulcer , little research relate role bed linens play affect moisture , friction , shear may lead development unit-acquired pressure ulcer ( UAPU ) patient acute care setting . This study use traditional cluster randomize crossover design patient five medical intensive care unit Cleveland Clinic evaluate efficacy silk-like bed sheet underpads prevention Unit-Acquired Pressure Ulcers ( UAPU ) . Nurses assess patient unit three month standard bed linen three month silk-like linen . For unit , order intervention randomize . Adult hospitalize patient bed standard bed linens versus silk-like linen compare 1 ) rate development UAPU , 2 ) time develop first UAPU , maximum severity UAPU develop . Upon entry study , patient assess baseline skin integrity admit nurse . Demographic data ( MRN ; unit name ; type linen bed ; admit diagnosis ; date admission/discharge ; age ; gender ; race ; weight ; Braden score ; date , location , stag UAPU development ; lab value ( albumin , total protein ) ; category Charlson Comorbidity Index record data collection form research nurse . Bed linens change per unit protocol . A sample size 3456 patient estimate . Patient characteristic summarize use frequency percentages categorical factor mean , standard deviation , percentile median range continuous measure . Comparisons patient characteristic , include Braden score , Charlson comorbidity index , unit length stay hospital length stay , compare linen type use generalize linear mixed effect model . For primary outcome unit-acquired pressure ulcer rate , generalize linear mixed model , assume Poisson distribution outcome , unit length stay offset use . In model , linen type study period use fix effect unit include random effect . For time event analysis , frailty model use ass whether time first pressure ulcer differs treatment type . Generalized linear mixed model use secondary endpoint , include maximum severity observe pressure ulcer .</detailed_description>
