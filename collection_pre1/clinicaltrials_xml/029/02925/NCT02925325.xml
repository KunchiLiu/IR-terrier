	<detailed_description>GENERAL PURPOSE : To evaluate clinical change relate application music therapy treatment Residual Symptoms Depression . SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES : 1 . Compare pre post treatment residual symptom HAM-D-21 , BDI , SCL-90-R CIDRS level . 2 . Compare change pre post treatment obtain instrument quality life ( WHOQOL-BREF ) , function ( GAF PSP ) perceive stress ( PSS ) value . METHOD Design - A randomized control trial two treatment arm : experimental group Music Therapy ( MT ) ; control group Usual ( TU ) treatment . MT treatment group design complete period two month , outline 8 session ( one per week ) . The TU correspond usual clinical psychiatric treatment ( drug ) assign attend physician INPRF . POPULATION - patient attend outpatient department National Institute Psychiatry `` Ramon de la Fuente '' 20 45 , consider remission major depressive disorder ( MDD ) ( DSM-IV ) score ≤7 include point Hamilton Depression Scale ( HAM-D-21 ) / ≤9 point Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI ) , positive response drug treatment / remain pharmacotherapy phase continuation maintenance , report detection persistent residual symptom . In research , participant control group experimental group , remain drug therapy throughout study accord instruction attend physician , period type administration shall sole decision . In case protocol assessment conduct plan . In case change drug therapy researcher take note consideration final result . SAMPLE SIZE - According calculation make , sample size 48 patient . With allocation 24 patient treatment ( MT UT ) . It consider recruit approximate previous historical study SRD sample ( Fava et al. , 1996 ; Fava et al. , 1998 ) . To calculate sample size formula `` comparison two proportion '' ( Fernández , 2001 ) , use follow : Where : n = subject require sample Za = Z value correspond desire risk Zb = Z value correspond desire risk p1 = Value proportion control group , placebo control usual treatment . p2 = Value proportion group new treatment , intervention technique . p = average two proportion p1 p2 The follow data consider : - confidence level 95 % safety establish . - A power 80 % . - effectiveness standard treatment prevent relapse ( Fava et al set 32 % . , 1996 ; Paykel et al. , 1999 ; Fava et al. , 1998 ; Teasdale et al. , 2000 ; Ma &amp; Teasdale , 2004 ) . - set 70 % desired effectiveness MT prevent relapse , consider performance psychotherapy report ( Fava et al. , 1996 ; Paykel et al. , 1999 ; Fava et al. , 1998 ; Teasdale et al , 2000 ; Ma . &amp; Teasdale , 2004 ) . This account 15 % subject possible loss sample accord follow formula : Losses set n = ( 1/1-R ) show n = number subject lossless R = expect loss ratio</detailed_description>
