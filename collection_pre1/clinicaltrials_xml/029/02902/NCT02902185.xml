	<brief_summary>HIV replication effectively suppress acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) prevent highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) . However , HIV-infected people must remain treatment continuously avoid viral rebound progression AIDS . HIV persistence think stem primarily presence integrated copy proviral genome within long-lived cell . Because active viral gene expression cause cell death due viral cytopathic effect immune response , long-lived cell likely harbor transcriptionally silent , latent provirus . HIV-1 persistence long-lived cellular reservoir remain major barrier cure . HDACi potential activate ( `` Kick '' ) latently infect cell . This make HIV infect cell visible immune system ; immune response antiretrovirals ( ARVs ) able attack eliminate ( `` Kill '' ) infect cell . This study subsequent NCT02513901 . The purpose study verify efficacy multi-dose Chidamide combination antiretroviral therapy HIV-infected adult suppress viral load randomize controlled clinical trial .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sixty participant recruit stratified CD4 cell count ( 30 &lt; 500 cells/μL 30 ≥500 cells/μL ) . Each layer 1:1 randomly divide Chidamide group Placebo-controlled group.Chidamide Placebo administrate 10mg time , twice week , interval le 3 day . Chidamide Placebo intervention last 12 consecutive week . All participant keep antiretroviral therapy study . This study last 96 week , involve 16 study visit ( Screening , Week 0 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 14 , 16 , 20 , 24 , 36 , 48 , 60 , 72 , 84 , 96 ) every participant . At screen visit , participant give medical history undergo physical exam ; blood sample collect . If participant agree , blood sample may store future research .</detailed_description>
