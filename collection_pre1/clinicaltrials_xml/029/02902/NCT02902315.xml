	<brief_title>Antioxidants Combined With Cryotherapy Inflammatory Response After Resistance Exercise Untrained Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The regular practice physical exercise promote anti-inflammatory effect , reduces mortality cause , especially cardiovascular disease . On hand , physical exercise induces acute inflammatory response . Acute resistance exercise provoke mechanical metabolic stress may vary depend intensity , specificity , volume workload . During exercise , reactive oxygen nitrogen specie ( RONS ) form , production exceeds antioxidant enzymatic capacity ( Superoxide dismutase , Catalase Glutathione peroxidase ) non-enzymatic capacity ( vitamins A , C , E uric acid ) result oxidation cell constituent . This state oxidative stress promote one inflammatory response , activation mobilization circulate white blood cell induce transitory leukocytosis , observe immediately resistance exercise . The local neutrophilia induces amplification inflammatory response feedback result activation and/or mobilization white blood cell . This sequence physiological event lead muscular remodel although , process , occur functional insufficiency sensation pain and/or delay onset muscular soreness ( DOMS ) , deserve special attention , may lead interruption abandonment exercise , especially concern beginner practice . Numerous preventive approach study intend minimize inflammatory response cause resistance exercise , include supplementation vitamin C ( ascorbic acid ) E ( alfa-tocopherol ) . These vitamin exogenous antioxidant able prevent damage cause RONS consequently attenuate oxidative damage induce resistance exercise . Cryotherapy define therapeutic application substance remove heat body , thus lower temperature tissue . Immersion cold water ( ≤ 15ºC ) common method heat reduction . Cryotherapy attenuate microvascular dysfunction , decrease temperature , metabolism oxygen demand electron transport chain . As consequence , low amount RONS produce less damage cause adjacent molecule . The aim present research investigate effect concomitant supplementation vitamin ( C E ) cryotherapy ( immersion water 15ºC ) leukocytosis , inflammatory marker , oxidative stress parameter pain untrained individual submit resistance exercise session .</detailed_description>
