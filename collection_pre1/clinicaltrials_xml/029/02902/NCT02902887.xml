	<criteria>The following criterion must meet patient enrol study : 1 . Age 3 11 year old 2 . Intermittent exotropia ( manifest deviation ) meeting follow criterion : Intermittent exotropia distance OR constant exotropia distance either intermittent exotropia exophoria near Exodeviation least 10PD distance OR 15PD near measure prism alternate cover test ( PACT ) 3 . No previous surgical nonsurgical treatment IXT ( refractive correction ) 4 . Visual acuity bad eye 20/40 ( 0.3 logMAR ) good ATS HOTV age 3 5 20/25 ( 0.1 logMAR ) good ATS HOTV age 6 11 5 . No hyperopia great +3.50 D spherical equivalent either eye 6 . No myopia great 6.00 D spherical equivalent either eye 7 . Patients must wear refractive correction ( spectacle contact lens ) least one week refractive error ( base cycloplegic refraction perform within 6 month ) meet follow : Myopia &gt; 0.50 D spherical equivalent either eye Anisometropia &gt; 1.00 D spherical equivalent Astigmatism either eye &gt; 2.00 D ≤ 5 year old &gt; 1.50 D &gt; 5 year old Refractive correction patient meet refractive error criterion must meet following guideline : Anisometropia spherical equivalent must within 0.25D full anisometropic difference correction Astigmatism cylinder must within 0.25D full correction axis must within 5 degree full correction . For hyperopia , spherical component reduce investigator discretion provide reduction symmetrical . Prescribing refractive correction yield lenses myopic 0.50 D spherical equivalent ( SE ) consider deliberate overminus allow enrollment . However , prescribe correction prescribe le full cycloplegic hyperopic correction ( i.e. , prescribe reduced plus ) consider overminusing protocol allow patient without IXT hyperopic SE refraction range would typically prescribe refractive correction . For myopia , intent fully correct , spherical component undercorrected investigator discretion provide reduction symmetrical result 0.50 D SE residual ( i.e. , uncorrected ) myopia . Prescribing correction yield 0.50 D minus SE cycloplegic refraction SE consider deliberate overminus allow enrollment . Note refractive correction guideline requirement wear refractive correction least one week apply patient require refractive correction criterion also patient wear refractive correction . 8 . No atropine use within last week 9 . Gestational age &gt; 34 week birth weight &gt; 1500 gram 10 . Patient and/or parent willing accept randomization either observation CIAO therapy . 11 . Parent phone ( access phone ) willing contact 1 . Only phoria distance near 2 . Prior nonsurgical treatment IXT refractive correction ( e.g. , vergence therapy , occlusion , vision therapy/orthoptics , deliberate overminus spectacle 0.50D ) 3 . Previous amblyopia treatment refractive correction within 1 year 4 . Vision therapy/orthoptics reason within last year 5 . Interocular visual acuity difference 0.2 logMAR ( 2 line ATS HOTV patient 3 &lt; 7 year old 10 letter EETDRS patient ≥ 7 year old ) 6 . Investigator plan initiate amblyopia treatment</criteria>
