	<brief_summary>Data limit dietary intervention trial suggest cardiovascular health benefit extra virgin olive oil ( EVOO ) may increase phenolic content . However , EVOOs contain array bioactive compound , little information exist regard physiological effect specific chemical specie . Among EVOO-derived phenolic demonstrate anti-inflammatory effect animal vitro model oleocanthal , inhibitor cyclooxygenase ( COX ) . The current study compare impact acute intake ( 40 mL ) EVOO platelet reactivity healthy adult male ( n=9 ) . The volunteer randomly assign consume three EVOOs double-blind control trial . The EVOO characterize choose equivalency total phenolic content fatty acid profile , differ oleocanthal oleacein ratio .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact Extra Virgin Olive Oil Oleocanthal Content Platelet Reactivity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ten healthy adult male ( 20-50 year age ) enrol randomize triple-blind , control crossover study test acute effect oleocanthal-rich extra virgin olive oil intake platelet aggregation . Each participant ask participate four study day , separate least 1-week , randomized consume study day 40 mL ( ~3 tablespoon ) either oleocanthal-rich extra virgin olive oil ( OO ) , extra virgin OO match total phenolic oleocanthal-poor , refine OO low phenolic In addition oil , fourth study day visit , completion study visit involve oil intake subject ask take 400mg ibuprofen . Collection procedure perform time day avoid circadian effect . A blood sample ( 50 mL ~ 3.5 tbsp ) collect measurement platelet aggregometry COX metabolites . Following initial blood draw , subject consume assign test product day . Two-hours follow intake assign olive oil , second blood sample drawn ( 50 mL ~ 3.5 tbsp ) . After second blood draw , study day complete .</detailed_description>
