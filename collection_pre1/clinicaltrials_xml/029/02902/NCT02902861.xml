	<brief_summary>This multicenter , multinational ( 12 center plan , Germany 9 center France , Netherlands United Kingdom ( UK ) 1 center country respectively ) , randomize , double-blinded , placebo-controlled study . The primary objective evaluate efficacy methotrexate ( MTX ) patient moderate severe Psoriasis compare Placebo assess primary endpoint `` 75 % reduction Psoriasis Area Severity Index '' ( PASI 75 ) 16 week treatment phase . As secondary objective safety efficacy optimize treatment schedule assess use multiple method ( e.g . ( Serious ) Adverse Events ( ( S ) AE ) occurrence questionnaire )</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Patients With Psoriasis Treated With Methotrexate Using Optimized Treatment Schedule ( METOP )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The present study initiate increase knowledge optimal dose regimen thus optimize efficacy safety MTX treatment patient moderate severe psoriasis . In view describe risk-benefit profile MTX , initial dose least 15 mg per week administer subcutaneously follow 5 mg folic acid p.o . 24 hour MTX application seem appropriate . Since 20 mg MTX per week proven beneficial considerable part patient , respond sufficiently 15 mg MTX per week , study dose start dose 17.5 mg MTX per week , administer subcutaneously . At start dose , expect find high MTX efficacy possible , appropriate safety margin . If patient , `` 50 % reduction Psoriasis Area Severity Index '' PASI50 response achieve week 8 , dose increase 22.5 mg MTX per week . All dosage use study lay within approve dose range MTX . The study conduct double-blind , placebo control manner . Placebo choose control since comparator allow reliable interpretation safety efficacy data .</detailed_description>
