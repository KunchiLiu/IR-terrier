	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study fluordeoxyglucose ( fludeoxyglucose ) F-18 ( FDG ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) /computed tomography ( CT ) monitor early therapy response patient glioblastoma . Diagnostic procedure , FDG PET/CT , may help measure patient 's response earlier treatment . Chemotherapy induce rapid change tumor 's glucose consumption measure imaging . FDG PET/CT shortly start therapy may help identify early therapy response patient glioblastoma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess early response therapy glioblastoma patient use 18F-FDG PET/CT . II . Evaluate early change FDG uptake within 48 hour start therapy correlate objective response parameter Response Assessment Neuro-Oncology ( RANO ) survival . OUTLINE : Patients undergo standard FDG PET/CT scan 6-8 week start chemotherapy one additional FDG PET/CT scan within 48 hour start chemotherapy .</detailed_description>
