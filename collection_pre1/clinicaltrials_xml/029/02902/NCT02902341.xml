Methods : 351 patient undergo either elective CABG aortic valve surgery study . Patients receive NT enrol January 2013 December 2014 . A historical control group consist 142 matched patient . Preoperative nutritional status evaluate . Resting energy expenditure measure use indirect calorimetry calculate . Caloric intake caloric deficit assess . The primary endpoint evaluate whether NT could limit caloric deficit ( Intake Need Deviation ) . A secondary endpoint address potential effect NT morbidity mortality .

	<detailed_description>Background : Malnutrition , often present sarcopenic obesity , widespread among cardiac surgery patient independently related adverse postoperative evolution outcome . Nutritional status energetic need deficit cardiac surgery patient poorly document undernutrition , though readily modifiable , often overlooked condition hospitalization . The investigator aim ass whether nutrition therapy ( NT ) could alter caloric deficit , morbidity , mortality patient schedule non-emergency coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) aortic valve surgery . Methods : 351 patient undergo either elective CABG aortic valve surgery study . Patients receive NT enrol January 2013 December 2014 . A historical control group consist 142 matched patient underwent either type surgery . In patient , NRS 2002 MUST score use evaluate preoperative nutritional status . Resting energy expenditure measure use indirect calorimetry calculate . A dietician assessed daily caloric intake entire hospitalization . Caloric deficit calculate . According predefined flow-chart protocol , nutritional intervention launch different time point . Interventions vary nutritional modification oral supplementation , tube feeding , parenteral nutrition . The primary endpoint evaluate whether NT could limit caloric deficit ( Intake Need Deviation ) . A secondary endpoint address potential effect NT morbidity mortality . Patients follow one year surgery .</detailed_description>
