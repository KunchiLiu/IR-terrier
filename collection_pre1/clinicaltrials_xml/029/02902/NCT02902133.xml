	<brief_title>Acetazolamide Prevent Post Operative CSF Leak</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Transsphenoidal resection sellar parasellar tumor associate significant risk intraoperative cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) leak ( 25 % pituitary adenoma , nearly 100 % craniopharyngiomas complex tumor ) . Postoperative CSF leak dangerous complication result infectious meningitis . In patient intraoperative CSF leak , various type intraoperative repair minimize risk postoperative CSF leak range 8-10 % ( Gaynor et al. , 2013 ) . The risk postoperative CSF leak increase high flow CSF leak patient factor , particular obesity ( Dlouhy et al. , 2012 ) . The risk postoperative leak decrease prophylactic placement invasive lumbar spinal drain surgery ( Patel et al. , 2013 ) , lumbar drain associate various disadvantage include discomfort , prolong hospital stay , risk infection , bleed serious complication . Less risky strategy minimize risk postoperative CSF leak patient population need . Acetazolamide ( Diamox ) carbonic anhydrase inhibitor decrease production CSF reduce sodium transport across choroid plexus epithelium ventricle brain . Acetazolamide give orally IV , widely use clinically decrease CSF production patient idiopathic intracranial hypertension ( pseudotumor cerebri ) active CSF leak surgery head trauma . In one small pilot study , Acetazolamide use successfully lieu lumbar spinal drainage patient undergo elective thoracic aortic aneurysm repair . Acetazolamide well- establish safety profile rapid onset action ( 4 hour give IV , 12 hour give orally ) . We plan prospective pilot study Diamox intend assess safety possible effectiveness Acetazolamide prevention postoperative CSF leak high-risk patient undergo transsphenoidal surgery removal sellar parasellar tumor .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Elective transsphenoidal resection tumor expect result intraoperative high flow CSF leak ; tumor include craniopharyngioma , meningioma , Rathke cleave cyst . Elective transsphenoidal resection pituitary adenoma , BMI &gt; 25 , observe low high flow CSF leak surgery , confer elevate risk postoperative CSF leak . Patients voluntarily sign Informed Consent Adults unable consent Individuals yet adult ( infant , child , teenager ) Pregnant woman Prisoners Patients prior adverse reaction acetazolamide take aspirin concomitantly ( may increase risk adverse reaction acetazolamide ) Patients moderate severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( may increase risk adverse effect acetazolamide )</criteria>
