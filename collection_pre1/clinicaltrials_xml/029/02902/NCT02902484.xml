	<brief_title>Study Nintedanib Chemotherapy Advanced Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preclinical data suggest nintedanib inhibits primary tumor growth vivo xenograft model pancreatic cancer , well inhibit metastasis pancreatic cancer model . This effect appear primarily due nintedanib anti-angiogenic property . The study perform clinical study evaluate safety tolerability nintedanib combine standard chemotherapy ( Gemcitabine + nab-Paclitaxel ) metastatic pancreatic cancer . It utilize advance image correlate include dynamic contrast enhance Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( DCE-MRI ) correlate tumor grade microvessel density . For patient , treatment two phase : nintedanib monotherapy two week period ( Days 1-14 ) follow combination phase nintedanib plus chemotherapy ( Cycle 2+ ) .</detailed_description>
