	<brief_summary>This study investigate influence maintenance therapy progression-free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) combination therapy BRAF/MEK ( MAP-ERK kinase ) inhibitor PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab . In safety phase I part optimal dose pembrilizumab combination BRAF inhibitor MEK inhibitor safety three-drugs-combination regime determine . In randomized part 2 different maintenance therapy test toxicity efficacy . Patients disease control 6 month triple therapy randomize receive 2 different maintenance therapy , either continuation triple therapy administration pembrolizumab alone .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There grow interest understand best strategy use targeted therapy novel immunotherapy treatment advance melanoma . This study explore combination encorafenib plus binimetinib PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab patient BRAF mutant melanoma . Combination two clinically effective approach , target mutant BRAF pathway BRAF/MEK inhibition modulate immunological checkpoint control administration PD-1 antibody , prolong PFS OS even . This study investigate influence maintenance therapy PFS OS triple therapy . Patients disease control 6 month triple therapy randomize receive 2 different maintenance therapy investigate administration pembrolizumab sufficient maintenance disease control . For reason safety phase I study performed determine optimal dose schedule combination therapy ( encorafenib , binimetinib , pembrolizumab ) . In phase ii-part , patient receive triple therapy dos define phase I 6 month induction period . Patients complete partial response stable disease 6 month period randomize maintenance therapy : Arm A : Therapy induction period . Arm B : Therapy pembrolizumab dose 200 mg every 3 week .</detailed_description>
