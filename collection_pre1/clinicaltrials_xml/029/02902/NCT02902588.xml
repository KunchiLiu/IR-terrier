	<brief_summary>The purpose study confirm applicability usefulness novel method assessment permeability blood-brain barrier monitoring treatment patient meningitis . The propose technique base evaluation kinetics indocyanine green ( ICG ) outflow brain use near-infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) . Usefulness NIRS-based method analyze relation reference method , contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Clinical trial healthy volunteer patient diagnose blood-brain barrier disruption : - Performing lumbar puncture routine diagnostic procedure patient suspect neuroinfection . Biochemical assessment degree blood-brain barrier disruption base albumin ratio . - Enrollment patient diagnose neuroinfection study obtain informed consent . - Performing measurement involve fixation NIRS probe patient 's head intravenously inject optical contrast agent - ICG ( 5-10 mg bolus ) . The measurement time 15 min . Monitoring patient 's condition examination use pulse oximeter monitor . The examination perform later 12 hour lumbar puncture obtain reliable correlation result method . The party responsible technical aspect investigation Sponsor party responsible medical aspect ( include injection contrast agent ) Principal Investigator . - Conducting magnetic resonance test . The MRI imaging carry test optical method , slight time delay ( 24h ) . The gadolinium inject 5 mL/s ( 20 mL per patient ) . Calculating cerebral blood flow cerebrovascular permeability coefficient pass information patient 's doctor . 3 . The assessment contrast agent outflow kinetics parameter obtain use optical method 4 . The correlation result evaluation blood-brain barrier condition MRI , biochemical assessment cerebro-spinal fluid optical method .</detailed_description>
