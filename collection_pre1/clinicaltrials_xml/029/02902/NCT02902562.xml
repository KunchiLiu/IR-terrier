	<brief_title>Synovitis Therapy Response Inflammatory Arthritis With Contrast Enhanced Ultrasound</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Inflammatory arthritis affect approximately 1 % world population lead significant pain disability . Although radiographs identify characteristic pattern joint space narrow erosive change , finding typically late finding represent irreversible damage . With development disease modify anti-rheumatic drug ( DMARDs ) , goal identify pre-erosive inflammatory feature identify patient progress severe functional debility treat immediately . MRI gadolinium enhancement proven effective early detection soft tissue , bone erosion , synovitis , integrity ligament , cartilage bone marrow edema . However , MRI expensive , may impractical assess multiple joint relatively long examination time . Some patient may claustrophobia may contraindications gadolinium administration . The investigator overarch goal determine whether perfusion information provide novel ultrasound base technique , contrast enhance ultrasound superb microvascular imaging , use assessment treatment response DMARD therapy inflammatory arthritis . The recent advance evaluation vascularity tumor use contrast ultrasound technique also apply rheumatological disease . It ideal develop sensitive imaging technique routinely available relatively cheap . Ultrasound available low cost use assessment treatment response DMARD therapy</detailed_description>
