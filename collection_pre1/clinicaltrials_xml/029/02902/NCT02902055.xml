	<brief_summary>Paediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) manifestation severe , life-threatening lung injury . Care paediatric patient mainly supportive base work adult personal experience , include use mechanical ventilation . However , difference lung physiology immunology ( young ) child adults suggest adaptation adult practice paediatrics may justify . A study adult severe ARDS show early use neuromuscular blocking agent ( NMBA ) improve 90-day survival increase time ventilator without increase muscle weakness . It unknown also true paediatric ARDS</brief_summary>
