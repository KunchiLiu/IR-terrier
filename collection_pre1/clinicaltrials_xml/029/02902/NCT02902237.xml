	<brief_summary>In phase I clinical trial cancer patient suffer solid tumor lymphomas , recur and/or refractory standard treatment treat intravenously ( iv ) increase dos tTF-NGR ( tTF= truncate tissue factor ; NGR=Asn-Gly-Arg ) . The objective trial evaluate maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) intravenously ( iv ) infuse daily application tTF-NGR 5 day every 3 week patient cancer , obtain standard treatment know disease entity prior entry study . Further objectives determine perfusion vascular volume fraction measurable tumor lesion versus normal reference tissue tTF-NGR application MRI biological surrogate parameter biological activity investigational medicinal product ( IMP ) , tTF-NGR , obtain pharmacokinetic data .</brief_summary>
