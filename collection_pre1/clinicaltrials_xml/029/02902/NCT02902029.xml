	<brief_summary>Most patient locally advance metastatic tumor succumb disease . Thus , substantial need novel therapeutic strategy improve outcome patient advance metastatic melanoma . Targeting Ras/Raf signal pathway BRAF MEK inhibition well target immunologic checkpoint control antiPD-L1 antibody emerge treatment option . In study best time sequential use treatment option ( BRAF/MEK inhibition antiPD-L1 antibody ) patient unresectable metastatic BRAFV600 mutant melanoma assess .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating Efficacy Safety Sequencing Schedule Cobimetinib Plus Vemurafenib Followed Immunotherapy With Anti- PD-L1 Antibody Patients With Unresectable Metastatic BRAF V600 Mutant Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At time experience concern sequence strategy use two effective therapeutical approach target Ras/Raf signal pathway BRAF MEK inhibition target immunologic checkpoint control antiPD-L1 antibody . This prospective , open , multicenter , randomize phase II study patient unresectable metastatic BRAFV600 mutant melanoma . In study schedule treatment combine BRAF/MEK inhibition treatment anti-PD-L1 antibody assess . After 3 month run-in period vemurafenib cobimetinib , patient show disease progression treatment interruption 28 day run-in phase randomize 1:1 ratio : - either proceed vemurafenib cobimetinib disease progression subsequently cross-over atezolizumab treatment disease progression ( Arm A ) . - receive anti-PD-L1 antibody atezolizumab disease progression subsequently cross-back vemurafenib cobimetinib disease progression ( Arm B ) . In translational research program tumor tissue , blood plasma peripheral blood mononuclear cell analyze evaluate biologic effect treatment sequence molecular profile biomarker expression tissue plasma .</detailed_description>
