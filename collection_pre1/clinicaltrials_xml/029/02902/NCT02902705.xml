	<brief_summary>Many metabolic disturbance , protein-energy wasting , inulin resistance , dyslipidemia common feature chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) . However , date , underlie mechanism disturbance remain elusive . Many vitro study demonstrate white adipose cell exhibit dysfunction condition mimic uremic environment . In good agreement , several animal experiment report chronic kidney disease associate lipoatrophy , adipose tissue dysfunction ectopic lipid redistribution . The goal protocol collect study structural metabolic property white adipose tissue CKD stage V patient evidence adipose tissue dysfunction associate CKD . The primary outcome measure cellularity adipose tissue ( i.e . size adipose cell ) secondary measure study gene expression profile use microarray metabolic property adipose tissue ( i.e . lipogenesis ) . To end , 15 male adult volunteer 15 non-diabetic non-dialyzed CKD stage V patient , match age , gender body mass index ( BMI ) recruit Departments Nephrology Urology Lyon University Hospital ( Lyon , France ) . The biopsy abdominal subcutaneous white adipose tissue ( 2-3 g ) perform elective urologic surgery ( i.e . peritoneal dialysis catheter CKD patient radical prostatectomy non CKD patient ) .</brief_summary>
