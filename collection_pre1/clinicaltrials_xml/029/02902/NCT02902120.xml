	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether patient treat chronic hepatitis C ( HCV ) zepatier ( grazoprevir/elbasvir ) prior kidney transplant strong immune response compare patient treat kidney transplant . 25 patient chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) HCV treat zepatier 25 kidney transplant recipient chronic kidney disease treat zepatier . Blood marker immune function monitor group determine response therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study pilot , prospective , single-center , open-label , non-randomized , non-controlled , parallel clinical trial . 50 HCV genotype 1 infected patient CKD define glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) &lt; 50 , approximately 25 pre- transplant 25 post-transplant patient , enrol study . Recruitment conduct renal transplant nephrology outpatient clinic University Maryland . The study involve two cohort patient : - Pre-renal transplant - Post- renal transplant The pre-transplant cohort include patient GFRs &lt; 50 , regardless whether list transplant . These patient recruit University Maryland 's transplant general nephrology clinic , infectious disease clinic , dialysis center . The transplant nephrology clinic multidisciplinary clinic incorporates nephrologists , pharmacist aid medication management , infectious disease coordinator assist patient coordination care . The post-transplant cohort include renal transplant recipient live donor decease donor organ infect HCV prior transplantation GFRs &lt; 50 active HCV viremia . These patient also recruit University Maryland 's multidisciplinary transplant nephrology clinic infectious disease clinic . Screening All patient screen Institute Human Virology ( IHV ) Clinical Research Unit . At visit , patient screen labs drawn history physical examination perform . Additional requirement genotype test prior enrollment , transplant post-transplantation cohort , disease stag within 12 month enrollment liver biopsy , elastography , biochemical testing . For genotype disease stag within specify time frame , genotyping elastography repeat part study screen work . Eligibility determine base upon result within 6 week start study drug . Given reduce efficacy regimen patient genotype 1a presence baseline NS5A resistance-associated variant ( RAVs ) , investigator screen patient RAVs patient HCV genotype 1a time enrollment . Any patient genotype 1a HCV find NS5A RAVs undergo 16 week therapy accord current treatment guideline . Starting therapy Study drug administer start day 0 history physical examination perform safety lab check . All patient sign informed consent approve Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) prior administration study drug . Study visit treatment Patients follow every 4 week receive study drug . HCV viral load ( VL ) , safety lab hepatic panel perform visit . Patients also advise study adherence monitor adverse event . Safety adverse event monitoring At study visit , research nurse inquire adverse event may may relate study drug . Any unfavorable medical occurrence record , whether consider related patient 's participation research , temporally associate patient 's participation research . Adverse event ( AEs ) classify grade 3 high report IRB principal investigator . Any grade 3 4 AEs serious adverse event ( SAEs ) review occur study team . Safety lab also draw visit . Levels immunosuppressive agent also determine visit appropriate . The need dose modification patient 's immunosuppression time visit record . End treatment visit Patients see 12 week start study drug ( 16 week case genotype 1a patient baseline NS5A RAVs ) end study visit . HCV VL , safety lab hepatic panel perform visit . Patients also counsel study adherence investigator inquire adverse event . Post treatment follow visit Patients follow every 4 week 12 week complete treatment . HCV VL , safety lab hepatic panel perform visit .</detailed_description>
