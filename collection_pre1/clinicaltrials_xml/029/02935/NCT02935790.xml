	<brief_title>Selective HDAC6 Inhibitor ACY-241 Combination With Ipilimumab Nivolumab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 1b , open-label , dose-escalation cohort study . The study consist dose escalation assessment safety tolerability ACY-241 administer concurrently combination ipilimumab nivolumab patient advance melanoma . Treatment divide induction maintenance phase . Determine safety , tolerability , dose-limiting toxicity ( DLTs ) , maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) , recommend Phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) ACY-241 combination ipilimumab 1 mg/kg nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 3 week 4 dos 12-week induction period , administer nivolumab flat dose 240 mg every 2 week maintenance 1 year patient unresectable Stage III/Stage IV melanoma . It anticipate clinical study enable selection RP2D dose schedule 3-drug combination clinical testing . The trial include assessment pharmacodynamic activity ACY-241 .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients must sign dated Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee approve write informed consent form accordance regulatory institutional guideline . This must obtain performance protocolrelated procedure part normal patient care 2 . Patients must willing able comply schedule visit , treatment schedule , laboratory test , tumor biopsy , requirement study . 3 . All patient must either Stage IIIb/c Stage IV accord American Joint Committee Cancer ( AJCC ) ( 7th edition ) histologicallyconfirmed melanoma felt surgically unresectable order eligible . Please refer AJCC Cancer Staging Manual , 7th edition description tumor , lymph node , metastasis staging . All melanoma , except ocular/uveal melanoma , regardless primary site disease allow ; mucosal melanomas eligible . Patients must receive prior anticancer treatment metastatic disease ( example , limited , systemic , local , radiation , radiopharmaceutical ) . Exceptions : Surgery melanoma and/or postresection brain radiotherapy ( RT ) central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases and/or prior treatment adjuvant interferon ( IFN ) ( describe Exclusion Criterion 2 ) . All patient must disease status document complete physical examination image study within 4 week prior first dose study drug . Imaging study must include computerized tomography ( CT ) scan neck , chest , abdomen , pelvis , know site resect disease set Stage IIIb/c Stage IV disease , brain magnetic resonance imaging ( [ MRI ] , brain CT allowable MRI contraindicate ) . The complete set baseline radiographic image must available treatment initiation . 4 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status score 0 1 . 5 . Tumor tissue resect site disease must provide biomarker analyse 6 . Prior treat CNS metastasis must without MRI evidence recurrence least 4 week treatment . Patients must immunosuppressive dos systemic steroid ( ≥ 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent ) least 14 day prior study drug administration , must return neurologic baseline status postoperatively . • The 4week period stability measure completion neurologic intervention ( ie , surgery and/or radiation ) . 7 . In addition neurosurgery treat CNS metastasis , adjuvant radiation resection CNS metastasis allow . Immunosuppressive dos systemic steroid ( dos ≥ 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent ) must discontinue least 14 day study drug administration . 8 . Prior surgery require general anesthesia must complete least 4 week study drug administration . Surgery require local/epidural anesthesia must complete least 72 hour study drug administration . 9 . All baseline laboratory requirement assess obtain within 14 day first dose study drug . Screening laboratory value must meet following criterion : White blood cell ≥ 2000/µL Neutrophils ≥ 1500/µL Platelets ≥ 100 × 10³/µL Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 × upper limit normal ( ULN ) creatinine clearance &gt; 40 mL/minute ( use Cockcroft/Gault formula ) 10 . Patient Reenrollment : This study permit reenrollment patient discontinue study screen failure ( ie , patient dosed/has treat ) . If reenrolled , patient must reconsented . 11 . Males females ≥ 18 year age . 12 . Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must negative serum urine pregnancy test ( minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L equivalent unit human chorionic gonadotropin hormone ) within 24 hour prior start study drug . 13 . Women must breastfeed . 14 . Women childbearing potential must agree follow instruction method ( ) contraception duration treatment study drug ( ) plus 5 halflives study drug plus 30 day ( duration ovulatory cycle ) . The halflives nivolumab ipilimumab 25 day 18 day , respectively . Given blind nature study , WOCBP therefore use adequate method avoid pregnancy total 23 week posttreatment completion . 15 . Males sexually active WOCBP must agree follow instruction method ( ) contraception duration treatment study drug ( ) plus 5 half life study drug ( ) plus 90 day ( duration sperm turnover ) . The halflives nivolumab ipilimumab 25 day 18 day , respectively . Given blind nature study , men therefore use adequate method contraception total 31 week posttreatment completion . 16 . Azoospermic male WOCBP continuously heterosexually active exempt contraceptive requirement . However , must still undergo pregnancy test described section . Investigators shall counsel WOCBP male patient sexually active WOCBP importance pregnancy prevention implication unexpected pregnancy . Investigators shall advise WOCBP male patient sexually active WOCBP use highly effective method contraception . Highly effective method contraception failure rate &lt; 1 % use consistently correctly . 1 . Patients carcinomatosis meningitis history ocular/uveal melanoma exclude . 2 . Patients previous nonmelanoma malignancy exclude unless complete resection remission achieve least 2 year prior study entry additional therapy require anticipate required study period ( exception include , limited , nonmelanoma skin cancer , situ bladder cancer , situ gastric cancer gastrointestinal stromal tumor , situ colon cancer , situ cervical cancers/dysplasia , breast carcinoma situ ) . 3 . Patients active , know , suspect autoimmune disease . Patients type I diabetes mellitus , residual hypothyroidism due autoimmune thyroiditis require hormone replacement , skin disorder ( vitiligo , psoriasis , alopecia ) require systemic treatment permit enroll . For case uncertainty , recommend Principal Investigator consult prior sign inform consent . 4 . Patients condition require systemic treatment either corticosteroid ( ≥ 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent ) immunosuppressive medication within 14 day study drug administration . Inhaled topical steroid permit absence active autoimmune disease . 5 . Prior therapy melanoma follow exception allow : 1 ) surgery melanoma lesion ( ) , 2 ) adjuvant RT neurosurgical resection CNS lesion , 3 ) prior adjuvant IFN ( see qualifier ) . Specifically , patient receive prior therapy antiPD1 , anti PD L1 , antiPDL2 , antiCD137 , antiCTLA4 antibody ( include ipilimumab antibody drug specifically target T cell costimulation checkpoint pathway ) eligible . • Prior treatment adjuvant IFN allow complete ≥ 3 month prior treatment . 6 . Treatment direct melanoma ( eg , chemotherapy , target agent , biotherapy , limb perfusion ) administer prior complete resection adjuvant radiation neurosurgical resection IFN resect melanoma . 7 .
