	<brief_summary>Cyanoacrylate tissue adhesives successfully use wound closure . The purpose clinical trial compare cyanoacrylate tissue adhesives polytetrafluoroethylene ( PTFE ) suture donor site connective tissue graft . Two group volunteer randomly assign one two study group . The wound closure palatal donor area achieve polytetrafluoroethylene ( PTFE ) suture one group high viscosity cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive group . The surgical procedure perform one three calibrate periodontics resident . Data collect baseline-day surgery one week post-operatively . The primary outcome patient 's discomfort donor site first week surgery . Secondary outcome time required suture placement cyanoacrylate application , patient 's pain donor recipient site one week post-operatively , painkiller intake , presence absence inflammation modify EHI early-wound healing index .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A prospective , randomized clinical trial conduct determine whether cyanoacrylate tissue adhesives suture well tolerate patient receive soft tissue gum graft . Periodontal plastic surgery procedures become integral part periodontal treatment address esthetic functional demand . Several therapeutic modality free gingival graft [ 1 ] , pedicle flap [ 2 ] , connective tissue graft [ 3 ] , graft combine two lateral modality [ 4 ] guide tissue regeneration [ 5 ] use cover denuded root augment width thickness keratinize gingiva [ 4 ] . Among various surgical technique , subepithelial connective tissue ( SECT ) graft remain commonly use successful root coverage procedure [ 6 ] . The esthetic functional success SECT graft technique highly predictable reliable give common place clinical practice [ 7 ] . Subepithelial connective tissue graft procedure require harvest tissue donor area , usually palate [ 8 ] . This addition another surgical site extend complexity procedure increase patient discomfort [ 8 ] . Single interrupt [ 7 ] continuous interlock [ 8 ] suture suggest donor site . Suturing common method wound closure . Other biomaterials staple , adhesive tape , adhesive glue fibrin sealant use generally hasten pace heal [ 9 ] . Adhesives interact different material , merge allow remain whole [ 10 ] . Cyanoacrylates bio-adhesives discover Ardis 1949 first use surgery Coover et al 1959 [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] . When applied two opposing , wet , live tissue surface , ability cement place [ 15 ] [ 9 ] . Their general chemical formula CH2=C ( CN ) -COOR , R substitute alkyl group , range methyl decyl [ 16 ] [ 15 ] [ 14 ] [ 9 ] . They polymerize rapidly within second exothermic reaction follow contact proteinaceous surface form strong flexible bond [ 17 ] . Methyl cyanoacrylate first glue develop , tissue toxicity preclude use [ 9 ] . The process cause histologic toxicity think related byproduct degradation cyanoacetate formaldehyde [ 9 ] . Further research show change type alkyl chain compound one long molecular chain reduce tissue toxicity [ 9 ] . Cyanoacrylates simple , inexpensive practical adhesive . Cyanoacrylates use achieve hemostasis intraoral extra-oral surgical site treat ulcer , attach graft , manage cerebral spinal fluid leak , stabilize bone fragment plat , seal sinus membrane perforation , achieve peripheral nerve re-anastomosis ; periodontal dressing ; number dental application [ 9 ] [ 16 ] . They slough surface skin mucosa 7 10 day adhesive application [ 16 ] [ 9 ] [ 18 ] . Butyl cyanoacrylate bacteriostatic , biodegradable , hemostatic cyanoacrylate long half-life good tissue compatibility [ 15 ] [ 10 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] . It adhere moist environment available formulation appropriate use oral cavity [ 10 ] . It proven effective closure uninfected intraoral incision edentulous area mandible , extraction periapical surgery [ 9 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 18 ] . Few study focus evaluate wound heal assess patient-centered outcome palate donor area different harvest technique [ 8 ] [ 7 ] . To best knowledge , study compare different method wound closure donor site . This prospective clinical trial aim obtain information determine technique patient 's standpoint superior . The participant randomly assign one two group . The wound closure palatal donor area achieve polytetrafluoroethylene ( PTFE ) suture one group high viscosity cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive group . The surgical procedure perform one three calibrate periodontics resident ( CS , JB , DR ) . Patients follow 1 month post-operatively resident monitor heal process obtain patient feedback . Data collect baseline-day surgery , one day post-operatively 1-week follow-up appointment . Randomization achieve use computerized randomization scheme communicate surgeon surgery independent examiner ( AC ) . Participants block-randomized three operator balance . Anesthesia achieve great palatine block anesthesia local infiltration , need , palate 1.8ml Lidocaine 2 % 1:100,000 epinephrine . The single incision harvest technique choose . Following administration local anesthesia single incision make anterior hard palatal vault . The length incision depend size graft need . Once graft harvest pressure apply palate hemostasis achieve graft maintain moist environment . Using 5-0 PTFE suture , continuous interlock suture 4mm apart placed suture group leave 3-4mm tail . Thin layer cyanoacrylate apply rinsed saline least 3 time interval least 30 allow complete polymerization cyanoacrylate group hemostasis achieve . The harvested tissue graft suture donor site . The day surgery-a baseline record obtain ( see attach form ) . A load dose Amoxicillin 2g Clindamycin 600mg , case allergy penicillin , provide participant immediately surgery Ibuprofen 400mg pain control . Postoperative instruction also provide . They also provide ice pack first 24 hour minimize swell recipient site . Sufficient amount Ibuprofen 200mg provide bag participant consume 1-2 tablet po q4-6h PRN . They instruct return bag record number painkiller consume 1-week follow-up appointment . A pain visual analogue scale ( VAS ) questionnaire pain leave site unbearable pain right site give participant note level pain palatal site day surgery consumption painkiller . Participants encourage contact operator problem time . Post-operative complication like severe bleeding , infection , abnormal pain , root exposure teeth adjacent donor site sloughing , need address scheduled appointment , record 1 month surgery . At 1-week follow-up appointment modify early-wound healing index ( EHI ) [ 8 ] [ 25 ] , wound length width , presence normal abnormal inflammation record . The number painkiller consume 1st week surgery count record . Participants ask report self-medication pain . Sutures removed suture group . A 1-week follow-up VAS questionnaire give participant fill 1-week follow-up appointment . The participant ask note level pain donor recipient site level discomfort ( eat , speaking , . ) donor site week surgery . Photos take appointment . )</detailed_description>
