	<brief_summary>Absorbable suture generally accept majority vascular surgeon possible complication breakage suture anastomose level . Some experimental clinical study current literature demonstrate use absorbable suture may even reduce important complication restenosis . The aim study compare absorbable non-absorbable suture patient undergo peripheral vascular surgery vein bypass grafting .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Absorbable Sutures Vascular Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Infrainguinal vein graft procedure may perform , generally , patient critical limb ischemia ( CLI ) popliteal artery aneurysm ( PAA ) . Autologous vein graft , adequate available , usually prefer conduit , especially knee vascular district . Vein graft may complicate onset stenosis ( 30 % case ) . Such complication may develop , due myointimal hyperplasia along body graft , often , proximal distal anastomosis suture perform . In vascular surgery procedure , case arterial anastomosis , absorbable suture material generally prefer , mainly fear breakage suture line . Previous experimental study perform animal human recent clinical study perform human carotid surgery show absorbable suture use vascular surgery may even reduce development intimal hyperplasia may reduce postoperative stenotic complication . The aim study evaluate early long-term result absorbable suture use peripheral vascular surgery . This open-label , parallel group study . Patients undergo vein bass graft CLI PAA may suitable entry ASPeVas trial . They must satisfy follow inclusion criterion : Both sex . Age &gt; 18 year old . Patients undergo femoropopliteal femorodistal vein bypass grafting ; must able give informed consent ; significant co-morbidity make life expectancy less six month . The randomisation process consist follow : patient consent enter trial , envelop open patient offer type suture ( absorbable non absorbable ) regardless surgical technique go perform ( femoropopliteal femorodistal vein bypass graft ) . All patient followed-up , day operation ( time 0 ) subsequently 1 , 3,6,9,12 18 month . At appointment , Ankle Brachial Pressure Index ( ABPI ) measure Duplex scan ( DS ) perform . In particular , mean DS peak systolic flow velocity ( PSFV ) multiple site along entire graft measure . A graft risk failure define PSFV &lt; 45 cm/s ratio V2 ( peak velocity site stenosis ) V1 ( peak systolic velocity point within 2 cm normal adjacent graft ) &gt; 2 . Any irregularity , inflow/outflow problem , graft dilatation also record . Clinical sign fail graft collect : disabling claudication , ischemic pain , ischemic ulcer .</detailed_description>
