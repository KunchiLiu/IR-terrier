	<brief_summary>Respiratory muscle weakness fatigue related clinical deterioration patient Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) . Respiratory muscle training ( RMT ) key therapeutic strategy patient . It necessary therefore increase dissemination large scale , improve patientÂ´s adherence optimize control implementation training . The aim project design RMT device include light sound incentive , digital registration application analysis training session , study effectiveness new shorten RMT scheme high intensity could provide add value enhance implementation training patient COPD . From operational point view , research organize three package complementary work focus design new portable dual valve electronic light auditory incentive component . The conceptualization design software analyze performance individual continuous use valve , evaluation feasibility , safety efficacy shorten schedule respiratory muscle training adult patient COPD realize .</brief_summary>
