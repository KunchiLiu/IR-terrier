	<brief_summary>The purpose study see difference sweat ( amount small molecule content ) collect different site body different method sweat stimulation . Additionally , investigator want know whether amount small molecule content sweat individual time , across individual give time . Finally , investigator want know consumption over-the-counter anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen affect inflammatory mediator content sweat compare blood . This information help well understand composition behavior sweat assess potential utility routine clinical tool skin research .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subjects participate 4 study day visit schedule 1- week apart . During first study visit , investigator compare sweat collect follow pharmacological stimulation sweating ( use drug pilocarpine ) sweat collect follow physiological stimulation sweating ( use stationary bicycle ) . During second study visit , investigator collect sweat follow stimulation sweat drug pilocarpine inner part forearm ( near wrist ) also upper surface thigh ( near knee ) . During third study visit , investigator collect sweat follow stimulation sweat drug pilocarpine inner part forearm ( near wrist ) . During fourth study visit , investigator collect sweat sample follow stimulation sweat drug pilocarpine inner part forearm ( near wrist ) blood sample ( one teaspoon ) arm . After blood sweat collection , participant consume 400 mg ( two tablet ) ibuprofen . The investigator collect blood sweat 30 minute , 2 hour 4 hour participant consume ibuprofen .</detailed_description>
