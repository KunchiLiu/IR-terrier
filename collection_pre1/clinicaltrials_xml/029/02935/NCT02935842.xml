	<brief_summary>Due Parkinson 's Disease ( PD ) speech language ( SL ) deficit may occur . Further , literature report PD patient , undergone deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) , deficit regard voice quality ( e.g . loudness intelligibility voice ) , PD patient undergone DBS suffer deficit word retrieval speech apraxia symptom . To-date , therapeutic approach focus specifically SL deficit observe PD-DBS patient yet develop evaluate . Therefore , study investigate short-and longterm effectiveness specific intensive , high-frequency speech-language therapy term reduce SL-deficits compare nonspecific non-verbal sham treatment ( i.e . rhythmic balance-movement training ( rBMT ) ) well 'no-therapy ' condition .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In course Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) speech language ( SL ) deficit may often emerge . In addition , severe verbal fluency ( VF ) decline repeatedly observe context deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) PD . Interestingly , PD non-DBS patient deficit respect loudness intelligibility voice , PD patient undergone DBS ( PD-DBS ) suffer rather difficulty semantic phonemic word retrieval , speech apraxia symptom . However , to-date best knowledge , therapeutic approach focus specifically SL deficit observe PD-DBS patient yet develop evaluate regard effectiveness . Thus , study investigate short-and longterm effectiveness specific intensive , high-frequency speech-language therapy term reduce SL-deficits compare nonspecific non-verbal sham treatment ( i.e . rhythmic balance-movement training ( rBMT ) ) well 'no-therapy ' condition .</detailed_description>
