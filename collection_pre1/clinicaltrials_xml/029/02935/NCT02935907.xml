	<brief_summary>APG-115 novel , orally active small-molecule mouse double minute 2 homolog ( MDM2 ) inhibitor . Mechanistically , APG-115 increase p53 p21 overexpression , activate p53 - mediate apoptosis tumor cell retain wild-type p53 . APG-115 show strong dose- schedule-dependent antitumor activity multiple human cancer xenograft patient derive xenograft ( PDX ) model . The preclinical data generate APG-115 suggest may broad therapeutic potential treatment human cancer single agent combination class anticancer drug . APG-115 intend treatment patient advance solid tumor lymphomas . Upon completion Phase 1 dose escalation study establish maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) , dose-limiting toxicity ( DLTs ) , and/or recommend phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) , several phase Ib/II study implement accordingly .</brief_summary>
