	<brief_summary>A previous study reveal dysphagia preterm infant show statistically significant improvement swallow mechanism feed cold liquid barium compare room temperature liquid barium . The previous study first identify positive effect , although , assess 5 cold liquid swallow , immediately room temperature condition . This limited data set restrict efficacy safety use cold liquid clinical practice , emphasize need information . The present study aim objectively assess influence cold liquid pharyngeal swallow mechanism preterm infant dysphagia 10 minute cold liquid feeding . The investigator utilize videofluoroscopic swallow study ( VFSS ) analyze frequency severity pharyngeal swallow deficit room temperature swallow compare cold liquid swallow various time point within 10 minute feeding . Safety measure also obtain , participant axillary body temperature gastric content temperature , identify indicator development cold stress .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Swallowing dysfunction , medically define dysphagia , commonly occur infant bear prematurely due inadequate timing coordination sensorimotor sequence require safe swallowing . Approximately 70 % prematurely born infant diagnose oral , pharyngeal and/or esophageal phase dysphagia inverse relationship severity gestational age birth . ( 1 ) Swallowing extremely important infant child meet nutritional requirement growth development . When swallow dysfunctional , consequence devastate infant , possibly result morbidity , complication include pneumonia , respiratory disease , growth compromise failure thrive . ( 1-6 ) The implication swallow difficulty , therefore , considerable medical importance medical team work infant . A videofluoroscopic swallow study ( VFSS ) widely use assessment diagnosis neonatal dysphagia . VFSS definitive investigation objectively assess adequacy airway protection swallow allows simultaneous view bolus pass oral , pharyngeal esophageal stage swallow . ( 7 ) For infant feed bottle , clinician relies VFSS identify correct swallow dysfunction . Several therapeutic technique modification use VFSS improve swallow safety infant , various nipple flow rate , ( 8,9 ) feeding position , ( 10 ) pace infant 's sucking burst . ( 11 ) The frequently use modification thicken infant 's formula breastmilk thicker consistency , ( 12-14 ) however , thicken cause difficulty make undesirable option young infant treat neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ) . ( 15 ) These difficulty result clinician use alternate therapeutic technique treat dysphagia neonate . One alternate technique feed infant cold liquid stimulate safe swallow . ( 16-20 ) Original finding obtain investigator first indicate cold liquid swallow reduce airway compromise dysphagic preterm infant compare room temperature liquid . Specifically , occurrence deep penetration ( p=0.029 ) , aspiration ( 0.017 ) , mild penetration ( p=0.044 ) nasopharyngeal reflux ( p=0.006 ) decrease significantly cold swallow ( CS ) condition compare room temperature swallow ( RTS ) condition VFSS . Similar finding document adult dysphagia . ( 21-35 ) These positive effect theorize occur due cold liquid provide sensory receptor within pharynx increase sensory information trigger efficient swallow movement . ( 12,13,21-23 ) The original study assess 5 cold liquid swallow , provide important information regard immediate effect cold liquid pharyngeal swallow mechanism preterm infant dysphagia . Further information regard duration positive effect necessary prove reliability modification use bedside . This study design assess swallow mechanism dysphagic preterm infant feed cold liquid 10 minute objectively identify change time . In addition paucity evidence regard improve swallow function time , safety feed cold liquid remain questionable preterm infant population . The great concern infant development cold stress alter digestive functioning due cold temperature liquid . The effect cold stress infant observe body system , include cool skin , tachypnea , respiratory distress , desaturation , increase episode apnea bradycardia , increase gastric residual , emesis . ( 36 ) Several old study assess effect cold feed healthy term healthy pre term infant , however , study population may representative today preterm infant population due significant medical advance increase survival rate extremely preterm infant . Holt colleague ( 37 ) find difference sleep pattern , vocalization , motility , intake , feed behavior , weight gain , temperature regurgitation preterm infant weight &gt; 1,500gm , feed cold formula . Gonzalez colleague ( 38 ) find significant difference axillary temperature gastric residual preterm infant feed cold ( 0-4°C ) verse room temperature ( 25°C ) milk . Participants include 14 preterm infant gestational age birth ( GAB ) 28-30w , mean correct gestational age 32 week . Anderson Berseth ( 39 ) find difference infant ' antral duodenal motor activity assess via manometry , well gastric empty among cold ( 6°C ) , room temperature ( 24°C ) , body temperature ( 37°C ) feeding group . This study include preterm infant GAB 25-36weeks , mean birth weight 915-2,455g . Corrected gestational age 32-36 week time study . Feedings give random order 3 liquid temperature . Across temperature find infant empty approximately one third bolus feed 20 minute . And across temperature approximately 10-20 % bolus feeding remain stomach 2 hour post-prandially . The author propose thermo-receptors within gastrointestinal tract appear functional age group . Blumenthal colleague ( 40 ) find statistical difference stomach empty rate cold ( 0-4°C ) , room temperature ( 25°C ) body temperature ( 37°C ) formula 20 healthy preterm infant mean birth weight 2.75 ± 0-18 ( range 1.49-3.38 ) kg , gestation 37-7 ± 0.6 ( range 34-41 ) week . They also report infant cold feed well tolerate produce obvious clinical effect . To assess potential risk cold stress , participant 's body temperature obtain pre post cold liquid exposure . To assess digestive functioning , temperature participant 's gastric content obtain pre post cold liquid exposure extraction gastric content via naso-gastric tube ( NGT ) . If child naso-gastric tube place time study , subject enrol documentation stomach content temperature obtain .</detailed_description>
