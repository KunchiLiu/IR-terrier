	<brief_summary>The purpose study characterize Pharmacokinetic confirm popPK model derive healthy volunteer hospitalize adult infected respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) determine adult hospitalize respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) infection dose response relationship multiple regimens ALS-008176 antiviral activity base nasal RSV shed use quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction ( qRT-PCR ) assay .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Evaluate Antiviral Activity , Clinical Outcomes , Safety , Tolerability , Pharmacokinetics Orally Administered ALS-008176 Regimens Adult Participants Hospitalized With Respiratory Syncytial Virus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study conduct 3 phase : screening phase , treatment phase Day 1 Day 5/6 ( depend time load dose ) , follow-up phase total 28 day post randomization . Participants assessment complete Day 7 , Day 10 , Day 14 , Day 28 . Depending discharge date , assessment complete either hospitalized outpatient visit . The duration participant 's participation approximately 28 day . The study perform 2 part . Participants randomly assign one 2 treatment group part 1 , one 3 treatment group part 2 . Treatment group evaluate PK safety target approximately 24 participant enrol part 1 initiate part 2 ( approximately 90 participant part 2 ) . An Independent Data Monitoring Committee ( IDMC ) establish monitor safety participant review data unblinded manner regular basis ensure continue safety participant enrol study evaluate whether efficacy objective meet . The committee meet periodically review interim data . Based recommendation IDMC follow interim analyses/reviews , increase duration may implement .</detailed_description>
