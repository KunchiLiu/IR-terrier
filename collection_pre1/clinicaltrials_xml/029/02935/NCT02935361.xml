	<brief_title>Guadecitabine Atezolizumab Treating Patients With Advanced Myelodysplastic Syndrome Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia That Is Refractory Relapsed</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To identify safe dose guadecitabine combination atezolizumab assess safety tolerability combination patient myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) refractory lose confirm response one hypomethylating agent ( HMAs ) patient newly diagnose MDS . II . To evaluate efficacy guadecitabine combination atezolizumab treatment patient MDS refractory lose confirm response one HMAs . III . To evaluate efficacy guadecitabine combination atezolizumab treatment patient newly diagnosis MDS . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To measure impact combination guadecitabine atezolizumab overall survival among patient relapsed/refractory MDS . II . To measure impact combination guadecitabine atezolizumab overall survival among patient treatment-naive MDS . III . To evaluate impact combination guadecitabine atezolizumab duration response patient relapsed/refractory MDS treatment-naive MDS . IV . To evaluate impact combination guadecitabine atezolizumab transfusion-dependence among patient relapsed/refractory treatment-naive MDS . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine baseline expression/methylation program cell death protein 1 ( PD-1 ) T cell among patient relapse , refractory treatment-naive MDS . II . To quantify impact combination therapy guadecitabine atezolizumab PD-1 expression/methylation T cell . III . To correlate response expression/methylation PD-1 T cell expression program cell death-ligand 1 ( PD-L1 ) bone marrow patient MDS treat guadecitabine atezolizumab . IV . To investigate expression tumor antigens MDS blast combination therapy guadecitabine atezolizumab V. To investigate specific T-cell subset MDS blood bone marrow combination therapy guadecitabine atezolizumab . VI . To investigate specific antigen ( epitope ) recognize T-cells MDS blood bone marrow combination therapy guadecitabine atezolizumab . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study guadecitabine follow phase II study . Patients receive guadecitabine subcutaneously ( SC ) day 1-5 atezolizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30-60 minute day 8 22 . Courses repeat every 28 day 24 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 90 day every 6 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
