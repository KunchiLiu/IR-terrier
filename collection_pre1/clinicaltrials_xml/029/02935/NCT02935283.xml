	<brief_summary>In proximal urea cycle disorder ( UCD ) , particularly ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency ( OTCD ) , hyperammonemia ( HA ) cause increased brain glutamine ( Gln ) perturbation think core neurological injury . In contrast , distal UCD citrullinemia ( argininosuccinate synthetase deficiency ; ( ASSD ) argininosuccinic aciduria ( argininosuccinate lyase deficiency ) ; ( ASLD ) cognitive impairment neuropsychiatric disease common even absence acute HA . As consequence , citrulline argininosuccinate ( ASA ) metabolic product implicate neurotoxic . In project investigator use state-of- the-art neuroimaging neuropsychological method investigate whether patient OTCD chronically elevate brain Gln reduce myo-inositol ( mI ) level correlate regional brain structural abnormality neurocognitive dysfunction . The researcher investigate whether acute episode HA elevate brain Gln decrease mI level correlate magnitude cytotoxic edema whether Gln/mI ratio threshold identify cytotoxic edema follow cell loss . Finally , researcher investigate whether region brain damage ASSD and/or ASLD distinct OTCD compare brain Gln level ASSD ASLD absence HA OTCD . The investigator also seek determine brain citrulline ASA identify brain patient distal UCD whether correlate brain abnormality see MRI neuropsychological testing . This project elucidate chronology brain pathology acute hyperammonemia chronic UCD whether , proximal distal UCD differ pathophysiology brain damage .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>UCDs group rare genetic disease affect protein break body . The cause UCDs deficiency one eight enzyme responsible remove ammonia , waste product protein metabolism , bloodstream . Normally , ammonia convert urea remove body form urine . However , people UCDs , ammonia accumulates unchecked remove body . Toxic level ammonia build cause irreversible neurologic damage affect metabolism , cognition , sensation , movement . This study focus common enzyme disorder among UCDs , ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency ( OTCD ) , disorder inherit mother . Using different type magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , study evaluate UCD-related neurologic injury affect metabolism , cognition , sensation , movement adult OTCD . This study separate three section . The first study study longitudinal change OTCD . The second section study recovery OTCD participant hyperammonemic episode time . The third section longitudinal study distal urea cycle disorder . In case , participant study attend initial study visit include review medical history , current symptom , impairment , diet history ; physical exam ; full neurological exam ; cognitive motor test . During visit , participant undergo image study additional cognitive motor test 1-2-day period . This include standard MRI study four session consist functional MRI ( fMRI ) ( CNMC ) , diffusion tensor imaging , 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy . For fMRI study , participant perform various motor behavioral task image scanner . Magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) use study evaluate chemical makeup specific brain area . Diffusion tensor image use ass myelination major brain pathway alteration disease state . This study involve multiple time point participation . The study conduct Children 's National Medical Center Boston Children 's Hospital .</detailed_description>
