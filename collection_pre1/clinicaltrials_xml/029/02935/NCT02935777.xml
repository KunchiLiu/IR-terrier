	<detailed_description>Participants ask visit QMU clinical lab three time . The first visit general information , form completion , measurement consent plus practise session COMPASS , study computer software . Information consent form screen questionnaire complete . Basic information age , sex , weight , height blood pressure data record . Lab visit 2 3 , week apart , constitute intervention phase . Participants randomly assign either pomegranate extract ( PE ) placebo group.The researcher participant blind capsule take data collection complete . The randomisation process carry independent technical staff use internet random number generator site allocate treatment . The PE placebo capsule look identical place seal , label , pre-prepared opaque container number technician . At next lab session ( visit 2 ) participant begin randomise study arm , take either two pomegranate extract two placebo capsule water mouth . Participants repeat procedure visit 3 , crossover remain intervention . Thus participant A consumed placebo capsule visit 2 , participant would take pomegranate extract capsule visit 3 , follow washout period week . If participant B consume pomegranate extract visit 2 , participant would take placebo capsule visit 3 . At visit , participant complete two computer test session last approximately 45 minute - one pre one post capsule ingestion . After capsule take one hour absorption period next computer test session begin . Participants fast tea coffee overnight abstain period intervention morning . On day test , request refrain alcohol , recreational drug , vigorous exercise . Participants also require restrict herbal extract , food supplement polyphenols dark chocolate , fruit rich polyphenols antioxidant less three portion 24 hr beforehand . A 24 hour pre test food diary complete assist compliance . Participants also advise good night 's sleep - least 6âˆ’8 h night study day - stress usual . These aspect confirm participant allow commence session . Pre-study saliva collection complete home participant early morning . This provide biochemical marker aim support cognitive finding result Bond Lader mood questionnaire complete computer test . Instructions give participant saliva collection sample analyse cortisol cortisone . Participants instruct usual breakfast except coffee tea . Blood pressure take pre post study visit 2 3 . The baseline computerise cognitive test battery administer clinic 9am last around 45 min . The investigator observe participant consume scheduled capsule . After one hour quiet absorption period around 11am , blood pressure take . The post cognitive testing battery complete second post study saliva collection take . Participants complete intervention around 12 noon . All assessment carry QMU computer , laptop use participant baseline post intervention assessment . The cognitive testing conduct control laboratory condition assessment baseline post study always perform time day ( 0830 1200 ) participant . Participant response cognitive test record automatically computer software test battery visit 2 3 .</detailed_description>
