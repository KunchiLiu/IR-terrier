	<brief_summary>Corticosteroids indicate treat men ASAs . Although many study confirm clinical therapeutic significance corticosteroid treatment men ASAs , study find therapeutic significance corticosteroid treatment men ASAs . Moreover , although report show high fertilization conception rate couple husband ASAs , report show ASAs negative effect fertilization conception rate . These contradictory result leave therapeutic effect corticosteroid men ASA continue controversy . This controversy also extend include usefulness assist reproductive technology ( ART ) treatment patient ASAs . In regard , although study show pregnancy rate follow vitro fertilization ( IVF ) intracellular sperm injection ( ICSI ) similar men without ASA associate ASA , others report superiority ICSI IVF intrauterine insemination natural intercourse men ASAs . It possible patient ASAs also additional problem ( ) relate sperm bind oolemma fusion ovum well sperm head decondensation . The latter condition may negatively influence mask clinical significance corticosteroid pregnancy rate patient ASAs . Some patient might benefit corticosteroid conventional IVF treatment due impaired sperm fusogenic capacity addition ASAs . Human sperm penetration assay ( SPA ) , hamster oocyte free zona pellucida , sensitive tool address potential impairment sperm bind oolemma fusion oocyte well sperm head decondensation . Males poor SPA result benefit ICSI whereas good SPA result still benefit conventional IVF . The present study therefore conduct address therapeutic usefulness corticosteroid name prednisolone treatment immunologically infertile men undergo IVF ICSI determine SPA .</brief_summary>

In case , wife ` ova inseminated husband ` semen sample . Identified men positive ASAs randomly assign treatment without prednisolone three cycle . Infertile men treat prednisolone tablet , po , 21 day wife 's menstrual cycle . Briefly , prednisolone regimen start dose 5mg , tid , two week follow 5mg bid five day . This taper one tablet 5mg/day two day . Patients give one week rest treatment , prednisolone regimen repeat another two cycle Treated men recover ASAs control patient underwent SPA . Patients positive negative SPA result admit conventional IVF ICSI cycle , respectively . Initial number recruit couple positive ASAs 241 . However , data 197 couple include study . Data 44 couple omit , patient comply prednisolone regime poor responder hyperstimulation . Only first embryo transfer cycle follow IVF ICSI include analysis .</detailed_description>
