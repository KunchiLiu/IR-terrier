	<brief_summary>The present proposal aim combine state-of-the-art integrate transcranial brain stimulation , electroencephalographic record technique genetics computational model unveil mechanism underlie fundamental cortical network process - synchronization neuronal activity gamma band ( 30-80 Hz ) - source intersubject variability . By measure entrainment prefrontal cortex produce weak oscillatory current , study team provide new non-invasive strategy derive robust estimate cortical ability support gamma oscillation , critically overcome limitation associate current approach allow measure solely dependent intrinsic regional cortico-thalamic property . Consistent molecular evidence investigator biophysical model gamma oscillation , study team expect unambiguous measurement cortical capability straightforwardly map onto key genetic underpinnings relate dopamine neuregulin signal pathway . These computational model use offer critical mechanistic insight link genetic variation variability emergent circuit-level activity form cortical gamma oscillation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Low Dose Intravenous Ketamine Treatment Resistant Depression Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary goal project study effect Ketamine cortical neurophysiological function Treatment Resistant Depression ( TRD ) patient . There three key preclinical finding regard Ketamine antidepressant effect motivate current study : ) low dose Ketamine cause early increase glutamate neurotransmission ; b ) Ketamine initiate synaptic plasticity ; c ) ketamine infusion lead rapid improvement depression symptom ; ) specific expression and/or methylation marker measure blood cell isolate treated ex vivo ketamine significantly correlate clinical response treatment patient treatment-resistant depression ; The proposal essentially employ robust non-invasive neurophysiological technique , Auditory Steady State Response ( ASSR ) -gamma oscillatory response Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( TMS ) cortical excitability investigate finding patient treatment resistant depression . Study : In first session , one group TRD patient receive low dose Ketamine ( 0.5 mg/kg ) 40 minute group TRD patient receive placebo-saline infusion . In second visit , patient receive ketamine first visit receive placebo-saline infusion patient receive placebo-saline infusion receive ketamine infusion . The study randomize first session , 5 patient receive ketamine infusion 5 patient receive placebo . The randomization break data analyze . The study continue remain 10 patient , 5 receive ketamine infusion 5 patient receive placebo infusion first session . Ketamine Infusion : The study team use slow infusion ketamine/placebo-saline solution time period 40 minute . Study drug provide identical syrinx , contain clear solution 1 mL ketamine , e.g . 100 mg/mL 9 mL normal saline 1 ml saline solution . Cortical Excitability : TMS stimulation apply corresponding region contralateral primary motor cortex determine motor threshold examine motor cortical excitability measure Ketamine . The optimal coil position determine move TMS coil 1-cm increment motor cortical area deliver single pair magnetic pulse observe maximal contraction contralateral abductor pollicis brevis ( APB ) . Electromyography reading obtain APB muscle . TMS stimulation apply Left DLPFC Left Brodmann Area 6 investigate cortical excitability change ketamine . Electroencephalography ( EEG ) record concurrent TMS procedure . ASSR/EEG paradigm : Participants may engage auditory steady state response task click train 500-ms duration present binaurally 65 Â± 5 decibel ( dB ) . The click train repetition frequencies 40 Hz present context auditory oddball paradigm ensure participant attention stimulus . This task do participant undergo EEG recording . Blood Tests : Gene Expression Methylation : To identify alteration gene expression methylation marker induce ex vivo treatment peripheral blood mononuclear cell symptomatic patient treatment-resistant depression ketamine ass correlation clinical response ( measure reduction Hamilton Depression Rating Scale - HDRS ) . For end blood sample collect subject immediately first administration ketamine . Brain-derived neurotrophic factor , ( BDNF ) : Serum BDNF test perform . For end blood sample collect subject .</detailed_description>
