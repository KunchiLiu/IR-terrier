	<brief_summary>An increase number specific procedure describe surgical repair pelvic organ prolapse ( POP ) concomitant stress urinary incontinence ( SUI ) . The investigator introduce alternative operative method POP-Q II-III repair anti-incontinence trans vaginal mesh ( TVM ) anterior edge fix periurethral tissue level mid-urethra . The efficacy short- long-term complication profile , new surgical technique compare non-modified TVM .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Anti-incontinent Effectiveness mTVM Method POPQ Stage II-III Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prospective randomize double blind study comprise 152 woman present correction stress urinary incontinence ( SUI ) conjunction anterior compartment pelvic organ prolapse stage II-III ( POP-Q II-III ) Departments Obstetrics Gynecology University Szeged , Hungary , June 2016 June 2017 . After block randomization method , patient divide two arm , study group consist 76 patient undergo modified trans vaginal mesh operation ( TVM ) , rest 76 patient control group undergo traditional TVM operation . Inclusion criterion study coexist SUI POP Q St II-III signature inform consent . The exclusion criterion follow : urge , mixed neurogenic incontinence , occult SUI , previous mesh operation , anti-depressive medical therapy , cancer pelvic organ , urinary infection , sign void difficulty . The transobturator TVM operation ( Sergent et al . ) modofied insert stabilize suture , fix anterior edge mesh para-urethral tissue level mid-urethra two non-resolvable anchor stitch thereby promote proper elevation closure urethra . The hypothesis stabilize suture treat coexist SUI well . In case , urodynamic examination carry surgery urodynamic examination comprise uroflowmetry , cystography Valsalva leak point pressure test pelvic floor ultrasonography perform determine coexisting SUI . The efficacy POP repair take significant ( &gt; 1 cm ) improvement point Aa , Ba , C D accord POP-Q system ( International Continence Society ) follow-up . The anti-incontinence efficacy classify SUI diagnose urodynamic examination pelvic floor sonography . All patient fill two validated Hungarian language questionnaires `` A short form Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Urinary Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire '' ( PISQ-12 ) `` Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory '' PFDI . After one-year application phase patient follow 36 month . During follow- phase repeat urodynamic study , pelvic floor sonography urine culture do 3 , 12 , 24 36 month . The evaluation POP-Q system Bonney 's cough test PISQ-12 PFDI questionnaire perform every regular check-ups</detailed_description>
