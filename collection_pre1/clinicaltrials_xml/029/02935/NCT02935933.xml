	<brief_summary>Evaluate effect addition morphine , dexmedetomidine bupivacaine PVB could improve analgesic effect thus reduce postoperative morphine consumption development chronic neuropathic pain , compare PVB bupivacaine , patient undergo major breast cancer surgery , i.e. , modify radical mastectomy ( MRM ) breast conservation surgery axillary lymph node dissection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paravertebral Morphine Versus Dexmedetomidine Acute Chronic Postmastectomy Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breast cancer commonly diagnose malignancy lead cause cancer-related death among woman . Surgery follow chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy mainstay current management . Chronic pain , persistent postsurgical pain , recently consider infrequent breast cancer surgery ( BCS ) , affect 60 % 80 % breast cancer survivor . The exact cause chronic pain BCS clear , association acute postoperative pain chronic pain generation BCS . Postoperative pain intensity analgesic consumption significantly high patient develop chronic pain BCS , suggest optimize postoperative pain management may reduce chronic pain . preoperative paravertebral block ( PVB ) administration additional general anesthesia , consistently demonstrate improve acute postoperative pain control decrease length hospital stay . The role TPVB prevent chronic pain still evolve . Karmakar et al . shed light impact TPVBs prevent reduce severity chronic pain breast surgery . The discovery peripheral opioid receptor lead clinical application add opioids local anesthetic peripheral nerve block . Studies 1990s show mixed result addition morphine peripheral nerve block , two suggest enhancement analgesia duration several show benefit . Dexmedetomidine highly selective alpha-2 adrenoreceptor agonist show sedative analgesic effect . Although approve intravenous ( IV ) sedation , extensively use off-label indication , include neuraxial peripheral nerve block , good result . A significant prolongation duration analgesia report dexmedetomidine add LA epidural analgesia , caudal block , subarachnoid block , PVB , brachial plexus block , ulnar nerve block great palatine nerve block .</detailed_description>
