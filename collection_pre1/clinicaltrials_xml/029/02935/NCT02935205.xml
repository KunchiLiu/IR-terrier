	<brief_title>Enzalutamide Indomethacin Treating Patients With Recurrent Metastatic Hormone-Resistant Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess toxicity indomethacin enzalutamide give combination , determine prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) response define 50 % reduction baseline . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine overall response determine Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 criterion ( PCWG2 ) . II . To evaluate progression-free survival ( PFS ) overall survival castration-resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) patient treat indomethacin enzalutamide . III . To evaluate molecular correlative patient response outcome analysis patient baseline tumor specimen ( diagnostic biopsy ) along serial blood specimen . OUTLINE : Patients receive enzalutamide orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) indomethacin PO twice daily ( BID ) QD . Courses repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 month .</detailed_description>
