	<brief_summary>Prostate biopsy transrectal ultrasound ( TRUS ) guidance consider procedure choice diagnose prostate cancer . And diagnostic biopsy procedure ; patient perceive anxiety , biopsy ultrasound guide prostate biopsy exclusion . TRUS guide prostatic biopsy mainly perform outpatient clinic , men undergo transrectal prostate biopsy experience considerable psychological stress . It may attributable fear potential diagnosis cancer , anal route penetration , fact subject organ examine part sexual system anticipate pain matter fact issue discomfort pain perceive throughout procedure refer negative impact whole procedure , probe insertion biopsy puncture . Thus essential employ simple method liberate patient pain prostate biopsy . Some study recommend sedation , others recommend intra-rectal lidocaine gel others periprostatic nerve block others recommend Nitrous oxide inhalation effective method analgesia procedural relate pain discomfort prostate biopsy . The employment analgesic , sedation and/or narcotic medication may alleviate much discomfort associate transrectal prostate biopsy , treatment may associate additional risk . Furthermore , systemic medication administer , patient require conscious sedation monitoring procedure , may inconvenient relatively expensive addition unsuitability perform outpatient clinic basis . Therefore , simple form anesthesia desirable . Although wide variety anesthetic technique available transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy , include rectal administration lidocaine gel , periprostatic nerve block , intravenous propofol , narcotic intramuscular premedication , method may optimally prevent relieve pain .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>From November 2013 November 2014 , 336 patient fit inclusion criterion underwent transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy ( TRUSPB ) . Informed consent obtain patient detail description study . Bowel preparation cleanse enema ( sodium phosphate dibasic sodium phosphate enema ) antibiotic prophylaxis Levofloxacin 500 mg. prescribe . Patients randomize three equal group Group I : receive intravenous diazepam 5 mg slowly probe insertion Group II : receive 10 cc 1 % Lidocaine inject periprostatic nerve plexus bilaterally ultrasound guidance use 22 gauge 7 inch needle , prior injection caution take aspirate injection avoid accidental intravascular injection lidocaine , proper needle placement injection lidocaine sonographic hypoechogenicity create rectal wall base seminal vesicle cause seminal vesicle separate rectal wall appear raise ( fig.1 ) prostate biopsy begin 2 3 minute lidocaine injection . Group III : intravenous diazepam 5 mg slowly probe insertion 10 cc 1 % Lidocaine inject periprostatic nerve plexus bilaterally ultrasound guidance . Prostatic biopsy perform combined directed random technique extend random technique absence focal abnormality mean number biopsy 10 biopsy ( 9 12 biopsy ) do per patient . The sedation scale evaluate accord sedation scale . After procedure , discomfort pain experience perform biopsy technique grade use 10-point linear visual analog pain scale . All patient monitor procedure possible complication , patient also question regard adverse effect one week duration ( time receive histopathological result ) .</detailed_description>
