	<brief_title>Safe Use Speaking Valve Children During Sleep Using Trans-tracheal Pressure Measurement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previously show Passy-Muir speak valve safe use sleep child . There adverse cardiopulmonary event see wear speak valve sleep . However , trans-tracheal pressure measure child asleep wear Passy-Muir speak valve.The investigator hypothesize patient tolerate speak valve awake similar trans-tracheal pressure measurement asleep awake . The specific aim proposal : 1 ) show Passy-Muir speaking valve worn sleep similar trans-tracheal pressure manometry worn awake . The primary outcome measure show trans-tracheal manometry measurement similar Passy-Muir speaking valve patient awake asleep Secondary outcome ) record symptom ( i.e . choking , gag , increased respiratory rate , abnormal breathing pattern , cough , chest tightness aversion ) wear speak valve either awake asleep b ) record vital sign compare normal baseline age ( i.e . heart rate , respiratory rate , end-tidal carbon dioxide oxygen saturation ) awake asleep . Background significance : Previously show Passy-Muir speak valve safe use sleep child . However continue contraindicate use asleep . A small prospective study do 10 tracheostomized adult patient mean age 70 year show use speak valve one night seriously ill patient associate apneas significant desaturations . A cohort study 32 tracheostomized patient show 14 patient able tolerate speaking valve 24 hour ; even sleep . Pediatric patient tracheostomy tube often unable vocalize . Tracheostomy tubes allow exhale flow air bypass vocal cord open tube make speech difficult . This cause delay speech development poor speech . Speaking valve , like Passy-Muir valve , restore normal phonation promote language development young pediatric patient tracheostomy . Speech development benefit see speak valve . Speaking valve lead improvement swallow safety reduce aspiration , improve ventilator wean lead rapid tracheal decannulation , reduce secretion management , improve hygiene , enhance smell taste . Evaluation speak valve tolerance do monitoring vital sign ( i.e . respiratory rate , heart rate , oxygen saturation ) . In addition , measurement trans-tracheal pressure invaluable tool evaluate subject speak valve placement . Measurement trans-tracheal pressure predictive good tolerance valve . The measurement allow one quickly easily assess patency upper airway ability force air vocal cord . If pressure elevate , great 10 cm water inhalation phase 30cm water exhalation phase , would indicate obstruction upper part trachea ( i.e . subglottic stenosis ) . The pressure also evaluate respiratory function prior consider patient placement valve . Many child bear medically fragile due prematurity , multiple congenital abnormality acquire insult ( i.e . cardiac , neurologic , etc . ) may require tracheostomy tube placement due need chronic respiratory support . Initially , patient assess speak valve clear use , patient may apprehensive toward speak valve . If patient display discomfort , anxiety , dyspnea/respiratory distress air trap ( build-up subglottic pressure incomplete exhalation ) trial repeat subsequent day . However , one assume initial failure due aversion , may due resistance upper airway , vice versa . The purpose study continue validate safety Passy-Muir speaking valve asleep , use trans-tracheal manometry compare expiratory pressure manometry patient awake asleep .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>. Any subject age 018 year age resident St Mary 's Healthcare System Children chronic tracheostomy may enrol . Patients approve PassyMuir speak valve per St Mary 's Healthcare System Children write policy . . Patients meet criterion use speak valve ( i.e . unconscious and/or comatose patient , patient require 24hour inflated tracheostomy tube cuff due inadequate ventilation , foamfilled tracheostomy tube , severe airway obstruction , unmanageable thick secretion , severe risk aspiration , severely reduce lung elasticity , intend use endotracheal tube ) . ii . Patients acute illness baseline status . iii . Have kind respiratory distress .</criteria>
