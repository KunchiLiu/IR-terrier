	<detailed_description>Asthma concern 7 % French adult population . About 10 % uncontrolled disease , despite high dos inhale steroid combine long act beta 2 agonist adequate management aggravate factor . They account considerable asthma morbidity , mortality cost . New treatment need patient . Asthma characterize change eicosanoids metabolism , especially high production bronchoconstrictive cysteinyl leukotrienes LTB4 . Recent study also demonstrate relative low production lipoxin A4 , endogenous lipid mediator result lipo-oxygenase action , distinct CystLTBs , anti-inflammatory property , bronchial epithelial cell lung macrophage severe asthma patient , lead imbalance pro-resolving pro-inflammatory eicosanoids production airway . Such data suggest aspirin , induces lipoxins production , could restore lipoxins deficit severe asthma , demonstrate model . Interest aspirin also support data obtain asthma patient aspirin intolerance ( Aspirin induce asthma , AIA ) , characterize severe difficult-to-treat respiratory disease frequently associate nasal polyposis , overproduction leukotrienes increase expression leukotriene receptor . In particular group patient , aspirin treatment significantly improve nasal symptom , quality life , asthma rhinitis score , reduces need hospitalization nasal surgery . A reduction oral steroid use observed series . In group patient , aspirin also induce decrease interleukin 4 ( IL-4 ) Matrix metallopeptidase 9 ( MMP-9 ) level sputum asthma patient thus provide another explanation anti inflammatory effect aspirin asthma . Patients treat high dos aspirin ( 650 mg BID ) favorable course treat low doses.Aspirin desensitization consider cost-effective therapeutic intervention patient moderate-to-severe AIA However , study , come mostly team , criticize methodological reason , low evidence , small series , weak asthma characterization . Potential effect aspirin patient uncontrolled asthma without aspirin intolerance , present change arachidonic acid pathway close observed AIA , establish . Because similar change eicosanoid metabolism describe nasal polyp mucosa , pathology frequently associate asthma , hypothesize patient nasal polyp asthma could specific target aspirin treatment . Aspirin cheap treatment , compare biotherapies develop severe asthma . Hypothesis The investigator propose compare effect aspirin ( 600 mg twice daily ) versus placebo , give six month , asthma control patient uncontrolled asthma nasal polyposis , whatever aspirin level tolerance , randomize , double blind , placebo-controlled trial . Study objectives Primary objective To assess whether long term aspirin treatment could improve asthma control , compare placebo , patient uncontrolled disease nasal polyposis , whatever aspirin tolerance level . Secondary objective To assess effect long term aspirin treatment compare placebo , patient uncontrolled disease nasal polyposis , follow criterion : - lung function - number exacerbation - time first exacerbation - oral inhaled steroid use dose - Nasal symptom - Nasal sinus symptom severity - quality life - Lipoxin A4 , cysteinyl leukotrienes ( cystLT ) LTB4 level sputum - Reactions oral aspirin challenge - Gastro-intestinal bleeding Study design This multicentric , randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blinded phase III clinical trial .</detailed_description>
