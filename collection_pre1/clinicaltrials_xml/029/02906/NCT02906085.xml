	<brief_summary>One third migraine patient experience aura , i.e . dramatic , transient neurological symptom , often form visual disturbance , usually appear onset migraine headache . The likely underlying mechanism aura know cortical spreading depression , wave change electrical activity slowly spread outermost layer brain . It currently know cause aura initiate patient relationship aura migraine headache , e.g . treatment target aura mechanisms prevent subsequent headache . Due short-lasting unpredictable nature aura , possible approach systematic investigation experimentally trigger aura , currently method aura-triggering available . The overall goal propose project reveal early mechanism migraine attack investigate initiate factor aura migraine brain . Current animal evidence indicate infusion endothelin-1 ( ET-1 ) , naturally occur signal molecule release blood vessel , safe likely trigger migraine aura patient . In project investigator aim study effect ET-1 human brain , investigate aura-inducing effect ET-1 patient develop safe reliable method experimental induction migraine aura use ET-1 .</brief_summary>
