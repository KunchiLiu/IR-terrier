	<brief_summary>Phase I : evaluate safety tolerability two different dose regimen Thymosin alpha 1 patient advanced EGFR mutation positive NSCLC Standard Care ( SoC ) therapy . Phase II : evaluate efficacy term PFS Thymosin alpha 1 patient advanced EGFR mutant NSCLC take SoC compare SoC alone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>First Line Bio-immunotherapy With Thymosin Alpha 1 Patients With Sensitizing EGFR Mutation Positive Non Small Cell Lung Cancer Who Are Taking Standard Care Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase I/Phase II , multi-center , open label , randomize , parallel group study determine safety/tolerability/efficacy Thymosin alpha 1 patient sensitize EGFR mutation positive NSCLC take SoC versus SoC alone . The study conduct subject sensitize EGFR mutation positive Non Small Cell Lung Cancer . Subjects sensitize EGFR mutation positive NSCLC screen eligibility clinical center involve . The study conduct two part . In Phase I patient randomize one two different dose regimen Thymosin alpha 1 treatment duration 4 month . At completion Phase I , data review single dose regimen carry forward Phase II . In Phase II patient randomize SoC Thymosin alpha 1 plus SoC treatment duration 12 month . All patient follow approximately 18 month .</detailed_description>
