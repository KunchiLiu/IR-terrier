The sample size check power analysis ( 2 side test ) follow parameter : value Î± = 0.05 , value power 0.8 , value common standard deviation 0.1 . The sample size group ( A B ) set 175 . Considering potential drop-out , approx . 30 % , final sample size determine 245 per group . The randomization perform independent third party ( i.e. , nurse preoperative clinic ) .
