	<brief_summary>This two cohort , open-label , pilot study describe efficacy administration time tocilizumab CART19 ( CTL019 ) associate cytokine release syndrome safety event pediatric patient CD19 express relapsed refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia high versus low pre-infusion tumor burden follow redirect autologous T cell transduce anti-CD19 lentiviral vector ( CART19/CTL019 ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Tocilizumab Optimization Timing CART19 Associated Cytokine Release Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The duration active protocol intervention approximately 12-15 month screen visit . The protocol require approximately 12-18 month complete enrollment.Approximately 39 enrol patient reach least 35 infused patient , ultimate goal 15 patient high tumor burden cohort ( Cohort A ) . Inclusion criterion design include pediatric patient age 1-24 year CD19 express relapsed/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) .Tocilizumab give high disease burden patient , patient manage CRS per standard algorithm ( include subsequent tocilizumab , need ) . Two cohort define base upon pre-infusion high versus low tumor burden ; high tumor burden cohort ( high risk severe CRS ) receive early administration tocilizumab CRS management low tumor burden cohort ( low risk severe CRS ) receive standard timing tocilizumab CRS</detailed_description>
