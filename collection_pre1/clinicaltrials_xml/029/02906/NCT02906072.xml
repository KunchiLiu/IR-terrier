Two meal replacement prepare mix two scoop register plant-based commercially available nutritional powder ( Herbalife European Free From vanilla low GI meal replacement add plant herbs , without gluten , lactose soy , source protein pea ) ) oat meal fluid ( water plant milk without oil ) thus yield 250-400 ml shake . The total macronutrient composition intervention diet approximated/targeted 15 % protein , 70 % carbohydrates 15 % fat . Dietary fibre content approximate 40-45 g per day . No calorie count limit institute test hypothesis ad libitum intake interventional diet allow significant body fat reduction . Participants , introductory program presentation , opt follow propose dietary intervention include meal replacement , attend lecture health effect low-fat plant-based diet , adjust diet judgment attend weekly body composition follow-up measurement , serve control . All participant follow weekly interval . Evaluation dietary diary meal photograph use correct adjust deviation target dietary plan help participant prepare meal accord dietary plan . Weekly lecture rationale guidance attain low-fat plant-based diet give subject ( intervention control group ) . Differences group test t-test unpaired pair sample , appropriate . Mann-Whitney Wilcoxon Signed Rank test use non-normally distribute data . Chi-square test use categorical variable .
