	<detailed_description>Introduction : Patients primary unresectable advanced head neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) poor prognosis median survival 22 month ( Hauswald H Radiat Oncol 2011 ) .

During past year , demonstrate conventional chemotherapeutics ( anthracycline , oxaliplatin… ) induce type `` immunogenic '' cell death ( ICD ) characterize exposure calreticulin tumor cell surface , secretion ATP release HMGB1 result activation tumor immunity ( Galluzzi L Nat Rev Drug Discov 2012 ) . The Na/K-ATPase inhibitor , digoxin , favor ICD , combine cisplatin , drug know induce ICD . In preclinical model , synergy observe cisplatin digoxin lead significant therapeutic improvement ( Menger L Sci Transl Med 2012 ) . This effect seem mediate immune system combine therapy induced intratumor T cell infiltration produce cytokine ( Menger L Sci Transl Med 2012 ) . Hypothesis : Based preclinical data , hypothesis add digoxin conventional cisplatin base induction chemotherapy regimen unresectable advanced HNSCC increase efficacy therapy via induction anti-tumor immunity . Objectives : Main : primary objective ass clinical biological safety combination digoxin cisplatin-based chemotherapy . Secondary : The secondary objective investigate biological marker efficacy analyze recruitment functional T cell tumour biopsy treatment combination digoxin chemotherapy . Endpoints : Primary : grade 3 4 clinical biological toxicity ( Adverse Events grade National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( NCI CTCAE version 4.0 ) Secondary : - Clinical/radiological efficacy monitor 3 cycle chemotherapy assess Positron Emission Tomography-Scan ( PET-Scan ) , Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) , ( computerized tomography-Scan ) CT-scan - Progression Free Survival ( PFS ) ( month ) - Biological efficacy monitor : 1 . Analysis T cell recruitment biopsy HNSCC patient therapy . The T cell recruitment consider significant T cell increase least 25 % post-therapeutic compare pre-therapeutic biopsy . 2 . Analysis subpopulation T cell ( CD8+T cell , regulatory T cell ( CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ gamma-delta T cell ) tumor biopsy immunofluorescence analysis show potential high ratio effector/regulatory T cell therapy previously describe ( Badoual C et al Clin Cancer Res 2006 ) . 3 . Expression IFN IL-17 assess quantitative RT-PCR assay ( Taq Man ) look production Interferon gamma ( IFNgamma ) CD4+ CD8+T cell presence T cell produce IL-17 observe preclinical model , ( Menger L Sci Transl Med 2012 ) . Methodology : Pilot , single arm , open label , phase I/II study . Study conduct : Patients meet inclusion /exclusion criterion , give 3 cycle follow regimen : 1 ) digoxin ( 0.25 mg/day ) 7-day period ( digitalization time ) Day 1 Day 7 ; 2 ) chemotherapy regimen TPF ( Taxoter , Platin , 5-FU ) protocol Day 8 D12 ( continuous perfusion fluorouracil 120h , Cisplatin Day 10 Docetaxel Day 11 ) administer combination digoxin 0.25 mg/day Day 8 Day 9 ; 3 ) 15-day period treatment . The digoxin dose adjust achieve plasma concentration 0.6-1.2 ng/ml accord current recommendation heart failure patient ( dos adapt renal function , comorbidities , concomitant medication , age , plasma concentration ) . The risk relate digoxin treatment minimize study since duration exposure digoxin limit 9 day every 3 week 3 cycle ( total duration treatment 27 day ) . Biopsies perform first digoxin administration end 3rd cycle . Patients unacceptable adverse event ( e.g . patient grade 3 4 toxicity improve &lt; grade 1 despite drug hold 2 week ) withdrawn study . Patients estimate glomerular filtration rate ( estimate MDRD formula ) decrease 60 ml/min/1.73m2 time TPF chemotherapy study withdrawn study . Patients manage jointly oncologist cardiologist Clinical Investigation Center Oncology safety tolerability assess cycle : Physical examination include neurological hearing testing , body weight , WHO performance status Cardiac status : echocardiogram baseline daily ECG rest cycle chemotherapy ( Day 8 Day 12 ) Day 1 cycle inclusion . Plasma digoxin concentration plasma electrolytes creatinine ( inclusion , day 1 cycle 2 3 everyday TPF chemotherapy regimen cycle chemotherapy ) . Regular report adverse event ( AEs ) grade NCI CTC version 4.0 . An Independent Safety Committee receive information end treatment period patient , serious adverse event ( SAE ) occur . A formal meeting hold every 3 patient . Randomisation : none Duration participation patient : 18 week include inclusion protocol Length study : 28 month 1/2</detailed_description>
