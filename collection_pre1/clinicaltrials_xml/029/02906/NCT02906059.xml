	<criteria>Provide sign date informed consent prior study specific procedure Age 18 year old Histological cytological confirmation Colorectal Cancer ( CRC ) available tissue , currently stage IV Failure firstline anticancer therapy oxaliplatin bevacizumab base regimen ( either radiological documentation disease progression due toxicity ) subsequent relapse disease follow firstline therapy . Patients relapse within 12 month complete adjuvant FOLFOX also consider eligible . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance Status 0 1 At least one lesion , previously irradiate , accurately measure ≥ 10 mm long diameter ( LD ) spiral compute tomography ( CT ) scan ≥ 20 mm conventional technique ( conventional CT , MRI ) suitable accurate repeat measurement Tumor sample confirm KRAS NRAS [ codon 12 13 ( exon 2 ) , 59 61 ( exon 3 ) , 117 146 ( exon 4 ) ] BRAF [ codon 600 ( exon 15 ) ] mutation positive . Patients must able swallow AZD1775 capsule Treatment within 14 day prior first study treatment conventional therapy treatment within 28 day prior first study treatment investigational drug Received 1 line systemic treatment advanced/metastatic CRC and/or patient whose first line therapy contain oxaliplatin bevacizumab Prior treatment Wee1 inhibitor irinotecan contain regimen Any unresolved toxicity ≥ CTCAE Grade 2 previous anticancer therapy , except alopecia neurotoxicity . The last radiation therapy within 4 week prior start study treatment , limited field radiation palliation within 2 week first dose study treatment Recent major surgery within 4 week prior entry study ( exclude placement vascular access ) would prevent administration study treatment History hypersensitivity AZD1775 , irinotecan , excipients agent Brain metastasis spinal cord compression unless asymptomatic , treat stable steroid anticonvulsant least 3 month Laboratory value list ( laboratory result screen ) : Absolute Neutrophil Count ( ANC ) &lt; 1.5 x 10^9/L ( 1500 per mm3 ) Platelets &lt; 100 x 109/L ( 100,000 per mm3 ) Hemoglobin &lt; 9.0 g/dL Serum bilirubin &gt; Upper Limit Normal ( ULN ) Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) : &gt; 2.5 x ULN &gt; 5 x ULN , liver metastasis present Creatinine clearance &lt; 50 cc/min measure calculate Cockcroft Gault equation Cardiac condition follow : Uncontrolled hypertension ( BP ≥ 170/100 despite optimal therapy ) Heart failure New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class II Prior current cardiomyopathy If NYHA Class I heart failure , Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction ( LVEF ) Multi Gated Acquisition Scan ( MUGA ) Echocardiogram ( ECHO ) less 50 % Unstable ischemic heart disease ( myocardial infarction within 6 month prior start treatment , angina require use nitrate weekly ) Mean rest correct QT ( QTc ) interval use Fridericia formula ( QTcF ) &gt; 450 msec/male &gt; 470 msec/female ( calculate per institutional standard ) obtain 3 electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) 25 minute apart study entry , congenital long QT syndrome Patients significant ventricular supraventricular arrhythmia patient cardiac conduction abnormality control ( e.g . pacemaker medication ) . Any evidence severe uncontrolled systemic disease , active infection , active bleeding diatheses renal transplant , include patient know hepatitis B , hepatitis C human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) Refractory nausea vomiting , chronic gastrointestinal disease ( e.g. , inflammatory bowel disease ) , significant bowel resection would preclude adequate ingestion absorption oral agent Clinical evidence bowel obstruction time study entry Female patient pregnant breastfeeding , male female patient reproductive potential employ effective method birth control History another primary malignancy within 5 year prior start study treatment , except adequately treat basal squamous cell carcinoma skin cancer cervix situ . Patients early stage cancer , therapy least 3 year may enrol permission PI disease unlikely interfere primary endpoint study .</criteria>
