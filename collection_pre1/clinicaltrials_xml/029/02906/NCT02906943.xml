	<brief_summary>Substantial progress make treatment cancer use target therapy , work one patient might work another patient . Certain drug develop target specific molecule body believe part disease . Biomarkers specific characteristic cancer may help provide prognostic information ( e.g . well patient regardless treatment give ) help predict sensitivity resistance specific treatment . The study collect archival tumor sample ( previously collect biopsy surgical tumor sample ) provide biomarker data patient 's cancer , may help physician identify clinical trial new drug treatment may appropriate patient future may also guide use approved treatment may potentially benefit patient . Another goal study develop province-wide registry target gene sequence test result make available cancer researcher . Additional tumour tissue blood sample collect study participant also store biobank Ontario Institute Cancer Research future research . The study also look link data study health care databases collect information health care patient receive , include medical test , clinic visit , procedure participate study . Having information patient health relate DNA sequence may provide new insight cancer treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A recent survey clinical genetic test laboratory cancer diagnostics Molecular Oncology Advisory Committee Cancer Care Ontario identify disparity access use pattern next generation sequencing ( NGS ) across province Ontario . All fourteen respond laboratory indicate NGS instrument either currently use clinical testing , validation stage , plan purchase NGS instrument within near future . Respondents uncertain test perform , cost reimbursement would address provincial funding agency ( e.g . individual test vs. panel ) , deal informatics issue NGS testing , storage , variant interpretation , utilization long term . Given increase use multi-gene somatic mutation test routine clinical cancer care ( e.g . KRAS , NRAS , BRAF mutation colorectal cancer , EGFR mutation ALK translocation non-small cell lung cancer , BRAF , NRAS , cKIT mutation malignant melanoma ) , need expand infrastructure NGS panel test clinical laboratory . With single payer provincial health care system , also opportunity develop provincial-wide registry NGS panel-based test result repository genomically-characterized clinically-annotated tumor tissue blood sample accelerate development additional `` omic '' -based test clinical use . This study enroll patient advance , incurable solid tumor select Ontario hospital receive standard palliative treatment ( ) . Archival formalin-fixed paraffin embed ( FFPE ) tumor tissue request undergo target panel sequence . An additional FFPE tissue sample request time future research purpose . Patients also ask provide blood sample future research . A selected number gene annotate research report provide treating oncologist . In addition clinically report variant , target NGS test result test gene capture clinical research database access treat oncologist secure web-based portal . Following reporting target DNA sequence result web-portal , remain tumor DNA store clinical testing laboratory . Blood sample collect time consent additional FFPE research block slide collect research transfer centralized biorepository maintain Ontario Tumour Bank ( OTB ) comprehensive analysis Princess Margaret ( PM ) -Ontario Institute Cancer Research ( OICR ) Translational Genomics Laboratory ( TGL ) . Blood undergo standard germline DNA extraction plasma processing future circulate tumor DNA ( ctDNA ) RNA ( ctRNA ) isolation PM-OICR TGL . Selected patient sample characterize PM-OICR TGL test development , additional sequencing , discovery research . All patient ask provide permission data-sharing cancer researcher . The consent also include provision review patient health record review patient chart administrative database ( i.e . Cancer Care Ontario New Drug Funding Program , Provincial Cancer Registry , etc . ) obtain addition information time drug treatment survival .</detailed_description>
