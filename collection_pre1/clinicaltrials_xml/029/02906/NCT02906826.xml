	<detailed_description>Background : - Airway clearance use airway clearance technique ( ACT ) one core treatment child chronic lung disease cystic fibrosis , periciliary dyskinesia , non-CF bronchiectasis unable clear secretion effectively . One frequently use ACTs call positive expiratory pressure ( PEP ) use mask produce back pressure lung get air behind mucus mobilize airway . Unfortunately adherence perform ACT low report rate 40 - 70 % . Up present , way objectively measure adherence ACT . However , new technology , feasible connect electronic device PEP mask objectively measure often child actually performing ACT . This propose study would first study objectively measure adherence report adherence . Purpose : 1 . To objectively measure adherence , use electronic manometer attach PEP mask , report adherence . 2 . Secondly , objectively measure adherence connect electronic manometer age appropriate video game design operate PEP mask use properly . The hypothesis actual adherence lower report adherence , use video game feedback mechanism perform PEP , adherence improve . Methodology : -20 subject either diagnosis cystic fibrosis non CF bronchiectasis , age 6 - 12 year old recruit study . Subjects control , report adherence measure actual adherence . After enrollment , subject provide electronic device connects pressure port PEP mask . They tell device attach PEP Mask pressure port measure pressure . Subjects ask continue use PEP Mask prescribe 4 month refer period one . During time electronic device collect data pressure often PEP mask use . In addition subject parent ask keep log book often PEP Mask . At end 4 month , second 4 month period , electronic manometer connect software allow subject play video game operate correct breathe PEP Mask . During period actual adherence capture electronic device measure reported adherence period also actual adherence measure first 4 month period . Primary outcome rate adherence prescribe therapy , measure report objectively measure adherence first 4 month period . During second 4 month period , rate adherence compare rate adherence first 4 month period . Secondary outcome change FEV1 period one period two . It hop use fun video game perform airway clearance , adherence improve .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis Bronchiectasis either chestradiograph high resolution computerize tomography ; cystic fibrosis diagnose sweat test use quantitative method genotype two identifiable CF mutation . Age , 6 12 year age competent spirometry . Have use PEP Mask primary airway clearance technique previous 3 month . Willingness adhere prescribe treatment regimen . Clinically stable evidence respiratory exacerbation within month enrollment assess site Physician . Diagnosis Allergic BronchoPulmonary Aspergillosis , persistent culture B.cepacia complex within previous 1 year period . On active treatment nonTuberculous Mycobacterium Use intravenous antibiotic within previous 30 day enrollment . Initiation change maintenance therapy within 30 day enrollment . Use systemic corticosteroid ( 1mg/kg &lt; 20 kg 20 mg prednisone per day ) within 14 day enrollment . Concurrent participation another study could potentially affect present study . Presence condition abnormality opinion site Physician would compromise safety patient quality data .</criteria>
