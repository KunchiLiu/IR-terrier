Many structural systemic barrier impede integration treatment HIV substance use ( SU ) . The use mobile application combine evidence-based training model offer innovative approach improve care coordination link patient care need dual treatment . A mhealth application deliver via tablet device provide unique channel link HIV SU treatment provider locate off-site clinic . This study Stage I pilot feasibility study first use theory-based model care coordination develop Care Coordination Intervention ( CCI ) treatment provider serve HPWUD . This study seek develop secure mobile technology platform : ( ) enable rapid communication among provider multiple clinic , ( b ) improve linkage dual care , ( c ) improve coordination patient service . The CCI also utilize evidence-based training model increase provider knowledge relevant HIV , PrEP , SU issue . The propose method integrate dual care patient expect efficient easily disseminable platform integrate HIV/SU care facilitate communication provider multiple clinic allow efficient management patient treatment referral service utilization . This project examine acceptability , feasibility , sustainability potential use mixed-methods . A three-phase , top-down research approach adapt , refine , pilot test intervention conduct . Phase 1 include individual interview key stakeholder audit referral communication process within clinic . Phase 2 include development CCI . The investigator conduct functionality test conduct series interview key stakeholder inform iterative revision CCI . During Phase 3 , investigator train provider CCI evaluate feasibility , acceptability , sustainability potential among HIV SU treatment provider locate two different clinic via pre- , post-test design . Data gather organizational- , provider- , patient-levels . Compared pre-implementation CCI clinic , investigator expect post-implementation data result : ( H1 ) great satisfaction care coordination provider level ; ( H2 ) increase frequency improve quality interagency communication ; ( H3 ) enhance interagency professional relationship ; ( H4 ) increase dual care retention patient level . The long-term goal expand availability sustainable intervention improve coordination HIV SU treatment service . Data research form basis future multisite R01 proposal early career , new investigator applicant .</detailed_description>
