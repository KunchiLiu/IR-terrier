	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives : - Part 1 : To determine safety tolerability GZ/SAR402671 administer orally , compare placebo patient early-stage Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) carry GBA mutation pre-specified variant . - Part 2 : To determine efficacy GZ/SAR402671 administer orally daily , compare placebo patient early-stage Parkinson 's disease carry GBA mutation pre-specified variant . Secondary Objectives : Part 1 : - To assess pharmacokinetic ( PK ) profile oral dose GZ/SAR4027671 plasma administer early-stage Parkinson 's disease patient carry GBA mutation . - To assess exposure GZ/SAR402671 cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) administer early-stage Parkinson 's disease patient carry GBA mutation . Part 2 : - To demonstrate overall safety tolerability GZ/SAR4027671 administer orally early-stage Parkinson 's disease patient carry GBA mutation compare placebo . - To assess pharmacodynamic response daily oral dose GZ/SAR402671 plasma CSF measure glucosylceramide ( GL-1 ) administer early-stage Parkinson 's disease patient carry GBA mutation .</brief_summary>

Stable medication regimen PD drug least 30 day ( least 60 day rasagiline ) prior randomization . The patient willing abstain grapefruit contain product 72 hour prior administration first dose GZ/SAR402671 duration entire treatment period ( Periods 2 3 ) . Signed write consent . Exclusion criterion : Parkinsonism due drug ( ) toxin ( ) . Patients carry mutation gene GBA associate increase risk PD , specifically LRKK2 ( G2019S ) . Patients Gaucher disease ( GD ) , define presence 2 mutate GBA allele . Montreal Cognitive Assessment score &lt; 20 Screening Visit . Patients prior surgical history deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) . Patients baseline brain MRI without contrast show structural abnormality possible cause PD sign symptom . Hepatic insufficiency liver function test ( LFT ) &gt; 2 time upper limit normal Screening Visit . The patient prior know positive result follow test : hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) , antihepatitis C virus ( antiHCV ) antibody , antihuman immunodeficiency virus 1 2 antibody ( antiHIV 1 antiHIV 2 Ab ) . Patients positive hepatitis B surface antibody ( HBsAb ) test history prior hepatitis B immunization eligible criterion meet ( ie , negative test : HBsAg , hepatitis B core antibody [ HBcAb ] , hepatitis C [ HCVAb ] . Renal insufficiency define creatine &gt; 1.5 time normal Screening Visit .
