	<detailed_description>Low back pain common clinical affliction involve back muscle , nerve , bone . This condition mainly manifest limited lumbar mobility , decrease back muscle strength endurance , disorder well asymmetrical movement lower back muscle . Although symptom severely impact quality life work , patient report precise origin condition . Low back pain may associate mechanical musculoskeletal damage , inflammation , cancer , infection . More 80 % adult experience low back pain point lifespan , although patient 40-80 year old . As many country age population , incidence low back pain increase globally .

Previous study confirm treatment ultrashort wave improve blood lymph circulation diseased area enhance phagocytosis macrophage leukocytes , well anti-inflammatory effect , make effective treatment low back pain . Additionally , thermotherapy directly expand microvascular network external annulus fibrosus , increase vascular permeability , promote venous return partial metabolic waste , increase analgesic substance endorphin level vivo , suppress generation pathological excitatory focus brain , accelerate self-repair injured cell , thus improve low back pain . Chinese traditional massage also common clinical therapy . The application pressure waist , hip , low limb affect side body improve local blood circulation , promote absorption inflammatory exudate , reduce muscle tension , loosen abdominal adhesion , mitigate muscle spasm restore normal anatomical position . Indeed , efficacy massage treatment low back pain confirmed , accord five report address manipulation treat low back pain Science Citation Index four separate trial regard manipulation list ClinicalTrials.gov . Transpubic symphysis reset massage therapy treatment low back pain . Although efficacy treatment observe clinic , study report efficacy transpubic symphysis reset mitigating low back pain . Data collection , management , analysis , open access Data collection Two physician , participate experimental treatment evaluation , collect patient data . The investigator use double data entry strategy . The data summarize numbered research manager . A database establish use Excel software . For questionable data , data manager present data query table investigator review response . The researcher answer question return table soon possible . The data manager modify check data accord researcher 's answer . If necessary , data manager resubmit question sheet . Data management After blind review database confirmation , researcher charge , sponsor , statisticians lock database . The locked database alter preserve , along original record , Shengjing Hospital , China Medical University , China . Data analysis All data statistically analyze professional statistician . The result statistical analysis report researcher use prepare research report . An independent data monitoring committee responsible data monitoring management throughout entire trial ensure scientific accuracy , stringency , authenticity , integrity . Open access Published data available www.figshare.com . Statistical analysis All data statistically analyze use SPSS 17.0 statistical software package line intention-to-treat principle . Data express mean Â± SD . Measurement data analyze analysis variance independent sample . Normally distribute data analyze use group t-tests . Non-normally distribute data compare use Wilcoxon test .
