	<brief_title>Evaluating Clinic - Community Based Pain Self-care Programs Low-Income Hispanics Opioids</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Significance Over past two decade , opioid analgesic ( OA ) drug increasingly prescribe chronic pain despite little effectiveness treatment &gt; 6 month . In prospective cohort , OA therapy worsen pain disability promote sedentary lifestyle . Yet type intervention necessary chronic pain `` curable '' conventional sense patient must learn maintain lifestyle increase function , mobility , cognition despite pain . The safety threat OAs galvanize U.S. Department Health Human Services ( HHS ) develop National Pain Strategy use non-pharmacologic approach manage pain first line management . Unfortunately , patient-centered program improve function pain proactive daily self-care behavior available low income , minority patient likely receive poor quality pain care . For low income , predominantly Hispanic patient chronic pain , investigator conduct trial non-pharmacologic pain management program deliver clinic- versus community-based setting . The program setting offer similar educational content : pain physiology goal set well train exercise , stretch , massage , mindfulness technique . This program incorporate element evidence-based approach demonstrate improve outcome chronic back low extremity musculoskeletal pain . However , little known engage person chronic pain self-care management . Therefore , program test delivery intervention two different setting : individually clinic group convenient community-based location . Objective : For study , investigator randomize primary care patient treat chronic low extremity back pain OAs 6-month multimodality non-pharmacologic pain care program differ setting , educator , individual versus group education . In one arm , subject receive pain care program individually health educator clinic , second arm , subject teach group expert nearby public library . Study Design : The investigator conduct parallel group , randomize trial clinic- community- structured program educate promote pain self-care low-income , predominantly Hispanic patient age 35-70 receive least two month OA therapy chronic non-cancer back low extremity pain . A total 90 subject randomize : 1 ) clinic-based self-care program lead health educator offer evidence-based pain self-care education onsite , 2 ) community-based program organize community health worker ( CHW ) assist student physical therapy self-care education training deliver content expert . A low literacy PowerPoint educational program Spanish English deliver trained health educator clinic 6 monthly session last 30-45 minute . In community 9 session deliver 7 content expert every 2 week first three month month last three month , session last hour . To increase availability community , group session offer twice week . Sessions include : 1 ) Orientation pain program ; 2 ) Pain physiology exercises/stretching ; 3 ) Stress management mindfulness ; 4 ) Massage therapy approach ; 5 ) Nutrition ; 6 ) Sleep hygiene ; 7 ) Relapse prevention-exercise ; 8 ) Health literacy , Internet resource ; 9 ) Review long-term pain self-care strategy . In community setting , participant able practice stretch , exercise , self-massage , mindfulness technique expert . For clinic , session condense deliver 6 meeting . All subject give information work personally select goal home activity receive phone/texting support health educator ( clinic arm ) CHW ( community program ) . Patient progress monitor self-reported log activity measure well measure take baseline , 3- 6- month assess physical mental function , pain quality life . The investigator hypothesize patient arm study show improvement primary outcome 5-x sit-to-stand test , reflect improvement critical skill rise chair , car , toilet associate improvement gait speed overall psychosocial function , describe . These validated physical mental function measure ( see ) In addition , patient adherence meeting collect compare implementation two program . This trial offer valuable foundation subsequent study effect multimodality pain self-care program help patient reduce even avoid reliance risky OA therapy achieve desirable functional goal . Impact : If either patient-centered self-care program improve patient functional outcome , sustain expand preexist partnership primary care clinic library system future study target reduced reliance OAs lynchpin chronic pain management improve option decrease long-term OA use chronic pain .</detailed_description>
