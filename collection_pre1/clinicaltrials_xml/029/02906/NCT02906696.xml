	<brief_summary>Bosutinib type tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) commonly use treatment chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CP CML ) . The standard dose bosutinib often cause temporary , severe , diarrhea go away bosutinib stop dose lower . The goal clinical research study learn low dose bosutinib effective standard dose . Researchers think start low dose bosutinib slowly increase dose ( need ) , likelihood severity diarrhea side effect may lower patient CP CML . To help researcher learn low dose bosutinib effective regular dose , researcher test cytogenetic response drug . Cytogenetic test look genetic change cell ( study , BRC-ABL protein Philadelphia chromosome ) may affect disease may react study drug .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bosutinib Dose-Optimization Study Chronic Myeloid Leukemia ( CML )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : Each study cycle 28 day . You take bosutinib tablet mouth 1 time morning every cycle study . You take dose study drug breakfast small cup water ( 6 ounce ) . If miss vomit dose bosutinib , retake dose . Wait take next dose schedule . If study doctor think best interest , dose study drug receive may raise lower , depend react study drug . Study Visits : On Days 8 15 Cycle 1 , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . If doctor think appropriate , may blood draw local lab doctor 's office closer home . The result send study doctor review . The study doctor study staff may also call discuss result blood draw ask . This call last 5-10 minute . On Day 28 Cycle 1 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 3-4 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - You EKG . On Day 28 Cycle 2 : - Blood ( 3-4 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - If doctor think appropriate , may blood draw local lab doctor 's office closer home . The result send study doctor review . The study doctor study staff may also call discuss result blood draw ask . This call last 5-10 minute . On Day 28 Cycles 3 , 6 , 9 , 15 , 18 , 21 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 3-4 teaspoon ) draw routine test BCR-ABL level test . - You bone marrow aspirate cytogenetic testing , check status disease , check genetic mutation . Based result bone marrow aspirate , study doctor may decide best interest stop bone marrow aspirate continue perform test blood sample instead . The study doctor tell stop bone marrow aspirate . - During Cycle 3 , EKG . On Day 28 Cycles 12 24 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 3-4 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - You bone marrow aspirate cytogenetic test check status disease . - You either ECHO MUGA scan . - You complete questionnaire symptom view health . If disease appear get bad doctor think need , tests/procedures may repeat time check status disease . Length Study : You may continue take study drug 2 year . If doctor think best interest , may able continue take bosutinib dose take end study , part regular care . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study long-term follow-up complete . End-of-Study Visit : If stop take study drug Cycle 24 , within 7-28 day last dose study drug : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 3-4 teaspoon ) draw routine test BCR-ABL level test . - You bone marrow aspirate cytogenetic testing , check status disease , check genetic mutation . - You either ECHO MUGA scan . - You complete questionnaire symptom view health . Long-Term Follow-Up : You call member study staff every 12 week 2 year every 24 week next 2 year . During call , ask , start anti-cancer treatment , side effect may . After , call 4 time year study end withdraw study . Each phone call last 5-10 minute . If doctor think best interest , may come back clinic additional follow-up , part standard treatment . This investigational study . This investigational study . Bosutinib FDA approve commercially available treatment chronic phase CML . It consider investigational use bosutinib lower dose compare standard dose . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 42 participant take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients CML chronic phase resistance and/or intolerance frontline TKI therapy . Resistance define lack ( lack define response achieve lose give date mention hereafter ) CHR ( complete hematologic response ) within 3 month , lack MCyR within 6 month , lack CCyR within 12 month therapy frontline TKIs . In addition , loss MCyR , CCyR MMR time course therapy also consider resistance therapy .
