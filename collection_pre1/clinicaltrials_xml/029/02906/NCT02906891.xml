	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Nocturnal Hypoglycemia Prevention Type 1 Diabetes Using Vigilant Diabetes Management Companion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot study determine whether large-scale randomized trial feasible . The pilot study test Vigilant Diabetes Management System effective adult T-I Diabetes prevent nocturnal hypoglycemia , improve moderate hypoglycemia , improve diabetes quality life reduce fear hypoglycemia . 2ndary aim : Health care professional adoption technology - medication titrate change , report system facilitate treatment decision , provide meaningful feedback reduce time . This single center 12-week Pilot trial one arm . Subjects serve control . The study include usual care patient MDI ( multiple daily injection ) CSII ( continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion ) additional use Vigilant Diabetes Management System . There 4-week baseline period prior 12-week intervention . Subject participation 4-week baseline period last 2 4 hour two visit . Subjects participate intervention phase 12 week require one additional visit 2 3 hour 3 month , routine population . Participants provide wireless blood glucose meter duration study download Vigilant mobile application mobile phone . The Vigilant system store blood glucose test result , pattern event , user setting . In addition receive blood glucose measurement enter user , store displaying , Vigilant provide follow feature tool user : Blood Glucose Reading review editing : The user able review data log manually edit blood glucose result . Pattern Messages : Alerts user one pattern find result enter , include pattern indicative risk severe hypoglycemia next 24 hour . Long Term Control Summary : Identifies current retrospective blood glucose average variability . The following blood glucose pattern identify Vigilant application : Weekly monthly glucose average overall within daily time period Daily period infrequent test Daily period high , low variable blood glucose - Daily Pattern Messaging System . Patterns blood glucose indicative increase risk low blood glucose level next 24 hour - Hypo Risk Indicator . Weekly monthly blood glucose variability - Average Daily Risk Range ADRR . Vigilant incorporate Tutorial Mode offer detailed feedback meaning pattern analyse perform software . In addition , two separate training video develop patient clinician initiate use understanding device feature . Caregivers access information outline , well summary screen highlight glycemic control metric patient risk notification patient Vigilant , subject patient approval . Subjects recruit one diabetes clinic . Patients type I diabetes history nocturnal severe hypoglycemia assess see eligible study . All consider eligible approached give write , informed consent attend screen visit inclusion criterion check . At Screening Visit follow procedure perform criterion check document : Signed date informed consent Assignment subject number Inclusion exclusion criterion Demographics - date birth , gender , race ethnicity Subjects Diabetes history Clinician Professional history SMBG-self-monitoring blood glucose training study meter Use study hypoglycemia diary Completion study questionnaire After consent , participant participate 4-week run-in baseline period 12-week pilot intervention collect baseline data glycemic control hypoglycemia ass adherence test criterion . All participant ask conduct SMBG self-monitoring blood glucose three time day ask record clinical detail hypoglycemia event . At end 4-week baseline period , participant return study visit investigator complete following : Download SMBG hypoglycemia diary data Obtain A1C Affirmation participant commitment test record To continue study , subject need obtain least three blood glucose value per day record hypoglycemia symptom episode . Prior 12-week intervention period , study participant complete validate study questionnaire -Hypoglycemia Fear , Diabetes Empowerment Survey etc . At visit 2 , subject complete training Vigilant program . They watch video demonstration iPhone , Android iPod Touch explain use Vigilant device . Study participant provide wireless blood glucose monitor ask follow normal diabetes management program subsequent 12 week . They ask use Vigilant program home conjunction provide wireless meter subsequent 12 week , accord follow instruction : The subject follow typical blood glucose-testing regimen , exception must perform average least 3 fingerstick blood glucose measurement daily time . Subjects ask keep log HRI hypoglycemia risk indicator pattern message receive , enter glucose reading deliver time , diabetes management action choose perform message receive . Subjects ask log whether understand feedback give , action take address pattern , . Subjects require perform specific diabetes management action address identify pattern . Worksheets provide patient facilitate record keep pattern message feedback . It prefer subject use predominantly study supplied meter course 12 week home use two glucometers maximum . Subjects instructed change date time meter event change daylight saving time , travel different time zone , match iPod touch Phone clock time . Subject instructed proper SMBG technique include use water dry towel prior test , avoid alternate site testing , use second hanging blood drop . The subject ask demonstrate SMBG test visit document proper technique . Participants follow three month 12-week intervention period . Subjects also receive telephone email communication study manager within several day begin home use portion study ensure patient understands protocol enter data accord instruction . At time also ask send several screen shot application log data pattern identify , ensure device work accord intend use data enter . Another follow occur 4 week study patient ask question give instruction . Subjects involve study also allow Vigilant-using clinician see Vigilant pattern , also plan see Vigilant-using clinician least regular check Vigilant use period . This do Visit 3 , desire . A follow-up final visit occur three-month end 12 week intervention period , typical routine schedule usual care . Additional visit may schedule provider indicate diabetes management . The following procedure perform follow-up visit : Blood draw HbA1c Download SMBG data Review patient diary data Data collection hypoglycemia event Review Vigilant pattern message patient log Completion study questionnaire survey</detailed_description>
