	<brief_summary>This study seek : Assess `` normal '' intestinal event rate healthy subject , determine effect meal size individual 's intestinal rate , determine whether difference individual fast post-prandial setting . The investigator hypothesize follow : 1 . Fasting intestinal rate consistently less 14 event per minute , similar previously document bowel sound frequency . 2 . There uniform increase intestinal rate immediate post-prandial setting . There direct correlation maximal average post-prandial intestinal rate meal size . Likewise , meal size correlate time baseline fast intestinal rate . 3 . Males low body mass index ( BMI ) experience high maximal average post-prandial intestinal rate shorter time baseline fasting level compare female higher BMI , respectively .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>AbStats : Assessing Post-Prandial Intestinal Event Rates Healthy Individuals</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants complete baseline demographic medical data sheet comprising age , gender , race , ethnicity , height , weight , education , employment status , past medical history , current prescription over-the-counter medication . An AbStats device along log sheet provide subject , return upon completion participation . Upon waking , prior oral intake , participant place AbStats disposable sensor abdomen secure use adhesive tape . The sensor connect monitor record sound collected sensor interprets create intestinal rate reading , measure acoustic event per minute . The device display numerical intestinal rate reading , measure acoustic event per minute . The device display numerical intestinal rate participant record personal log sheet . The purpose value assess intestinal rate fasting . Participants eat small standardize breakfast comprise thinkThin oatmeal single serve bowl , toast English muffin butter , 11oz iced coffee . No addition substitution permit order standardize meal . The percent food eaten record log sheet . Lunch Day 1 `` small meal '' consist half turkey Swiss Corner Bakery sandwich , cup fruit , 12oz diet soda . It eat four five hour breakfast . No snack permit breakfast lunch . Again , pre-meal intestinal rate reading obtain 30 minute prior eat lunch ; participant secure device onto abdomen multiple time order gather post-prandial data . The intestinal rate record log sheet . The subject record intestinal rate every 30 minute 5 hour completion meal ( e.g. , lunch 12 pm , place sensor abdomen 10 minute 12:30 pm , 1:00 pm , 1:30 pm , 2:00 pm , 2:30 pm , 3:00 pm , 3:30 pm , 4 : 00 pm , 4:30 pm , 5:00 pm ) . Afterwards , participant eat freely data point obtain . Dinner meal choosing . Day 2 study largely similar Day 1 : participant measure fast intestinal rate upon wake eat standardize breakfast ( see ) . The main difference Day 2 participant eat `` large meal '' lunch consist full turkey Swiss Corner Bakery sandwich , cup fruit , small bag potato chip , small cookie , 12oz diet soda . The pre- post-lunch measurement note measure record . By perform , investigator assess preliminary intestinal rate measurement fast state , small lunch ( Day 1 ) , large lunch ( Day 2 ) .</detailed_description>
