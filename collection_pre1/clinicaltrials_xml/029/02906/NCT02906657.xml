	<brief_summary>Context Adverse drug event ( ADEs ) may occur hospitalized patient may result discrepancy patient 's current medication drug prescribe admission ( omission , commission , dose errors…. ) . Consequences discrepancy may mild ( e.g . isolated biological abnormality ) , may also lead severe clinical outcome . Medication reconciliation process create accurate list patient 's current medication order decrease discrepancy eventually ADEs . Information technology electronic health record great interest process . In France , medication dispense community pharmacy past 4 month register patient 's electronic pharmaceutical record . The impact record together pharmacist medication reconciliation test CONCIPAGE study . Design The CONCIPAGE study national , multicenter , cluster-randomized , two-period cross-over study . It estimate impact medication reconciliation , make pharmacist , use patient pharmaceutical record , occurrence ADEs hospitalization patient age 65 year . Fifteen hospital gather 20 center ( 8 geriatric department , 8 internal medicine department , 4 orthopedic surgery department ) participate study . An equilibrated randomization apply 20 center . The recruiting period last 24 month divide four 6-month consecutive period ( A , B , C , D ) . During first 6-month period ( period A ) , 5 center ( 1 5 ) apply one strategy ( intervention usual care ) 5 others ( 6 10 ) apply alternative strategy . Centers 11 20 recruit patient period A . During next period ( period B ) , center 11 15 16 20 apply intervention control strategy , center 1 10 apply 6-month wash-out period . During period C , center 1 10 apply alternative strategy compare applied period A ( cross-over design ) , center 11 20 apply 6-month wash-out period . During period D , center 11 20 apply alternative strategy compare applied period B , center 1 10 recruit patient period D. Description intervention During control period , intervention hold . The prior admission medication list make usual hospital physician : interview patient relative , prescription bring patient , call community physician pharmacist , hospital medical record , etc . This process result medication prescription list admission . During intervention period , local hospital pharmacist independently perform additional ( i.e . make hospital physician ) prior admission medication list , use above-mentioned source addition , help electronic pharmaceutical record . The medical reconciliation intervention period consist comparison pharmacist 's physician 's prior admission medication list . Such reconciliation might lead modification medication prescription make physician admission . Patient follow-up Patients include day admission followed-up 30 day . A study pharmacist enrol charge collect follow-up data patient . The study pharmacist visit center 2 , 4 , 7 month begin period . He/she study record patient include study , collect potential biological clinical abnormality , prescription antidotes diagnostic imaging , transfer ICU , death . Objectives The primary objective study assess impact medication reconciliation pharmacist use usual source plus electronic pharmaceutical record ADEs occur hospital setting . The secondary objective follow : - To assess severity preventability ADEs group . - To assess distribution ADEs group . - To compare 30-day mortality rate observe two group . - In intervention group , ass rate intentional ( treatment modification intend physician ) unintentional discrepancy prior admission medication list make pharmacist hospital physician 's prescription admission . - In intervention group , assess rate discrepancy hospital prescription admission prescription medical reconciliation . - To estimate cost-effectiveness intervention .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Medication Reconciliation Using Electronic Pharmaceutical Record : A Multicenter Study Hospitalized Elderly</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Context Adverse drug event ( ADEs ) may occur community hospitalize patient . A review literature report incidence ADEs vary 0.1 61.4 % . This wide range may explain different design case-mix study . For instance , incidence ADEs high surgical ward elderly , increase number prescribe drug . In elderly , risk ADE report 2-fold high young population . Some ADEs may prevent , example event associate intend know effect ( e.g . neutropenia cytotoxic drug administration ) . However , ADEs might prevent whenever related medication error ( omission , commission , dose error , prescription despite know allergies… ) . The proportion preventable ADEs report range 25 % 43 % total ADEs . ADE lead extra monitoring biological abnormality also serious case , temporary permanent harm , even death . Prolonged hospitalization also attribute ADE . Gastrointestinal tract event common type ADEs , follow electrolyte renal event , hemorrhage , metabolic endocrine event . Drugs involve cardiovascular drug , follow analgesic , antibiotic anticoagulant . Discrepancies patient 's current medication drug prescribe hospital admission hospital frequent ( 27 54 % ) report numerous study . Potential consequence discrepancy extensively study data deal clinical outcome sparse . Medication reconciliation process aim creation appropriate list patient 's medication , thus decrease medication discrepancy eventually ADE . Medication reconciliation perform physician , nurse , pharmacist . Usual source information medication reconciliation patient 's prescription attend physician , patient 's interview , hospital records… Additionally , information technology electronic health record great help process . In France , drug dispense patient community pharmacies 4 past month register his/her electronic pharmaceutical record available pharmacist nationwide . This database protect consulted recognition patient 's healthcare card . To date , contribution record medication reconciliation study . The CONCIPAGE study estimate impact medication reconciliation use patient pharmaceutical record , occurrence ADEs hospitalization patient age 65 year . Design The CONCIPAGE study national , multicenter , cluster-randomized , two-period cross-over study . It estimate impact medication reconciliation use patient pharmaceutical record , occurrence ADEs hospitalization patient age 65 year . Fifteen hospital gather 20 center ( 8 geriatric department , 8 internal medicine department , 4 orthopedic surgery department ) participate study . An equilibrated randomization apply 20 center . The recruiting period last 24 month divide four 6-month consecutive period ( A , B , C , D ) . During first 6-month period ( period A ) , 5 center ( 1 5 ) apply one strategy ( intervention usual care ) 5 others ( 6 10 ) apply alternative strategy . Centers 11 20 recruit patient period A . During next period ( period B ) , center 11 15 16 20 apply intervention control strategy , center 1 10 apply 6-month wash-out period . During period C , center 1 10 apply alternative strategy compare applied period A ( cross-over design ) , center 11 20 apply 6-month wash-out period . During period D , center 11 20 apply alternative strategy compare applied period B , center 1 10 recruit patient period D. Description intervention During control period , intervention hold . The prior admission medication list make usual hospital physician : interview patient relative , prescription bring patient , call community physician pharmacist , hospital medical record , etc . This process result medication prescription list admission . During intervention period , local hospital pharmacist independently perform additional ( i.e . make hospital physician ) prior admission medication list , use above-mentioned source addition , help electronic pharmaceutical record . The medical reconciliation intervention period consist comparison pharmacist 's physician 's prior admission medication list . Such reconciliation might lead modification medication prescription make physician admission . Patient follow-up Patients include day admission followed-up 30 day . A study pharmacist enrol charge collect follow-up data patient . The study pharmacist visit center 2 , 4 , 7 month begin period . He/she study record patient include study , collect potential biological clinical abnormality , prescription antidotes diagnostic imaging , transfer ICU , death . Objectives The primary objective study assess impact medication reconciliation pharmacist use usual source plus electronic pharmaceutical record ADE occur hospital setting . The secondary objective follow : - To assess severity preventability ADE group . - To assess distribution ADE group . - To compare 30-day mortality rate observe two group - In intervention group , ass rate intentional ( treatment modification intend physician ) unintentional discrepancy prior admission medication list make pharmacist hospital physician 's prescription admission . - In intervention group , assess rate discrepancy hospital prescription admission prescription medical reconciliation - To estimate cost-effectiveness intervention . Analysis set . The primary analysis conduct accord intent-to-treat principle ( ITT ) , individual level , consider every patient include irrespective patient 's follow-up take account cluster nature data . Sample size The calculation number patient take account cluster cross-over design result 44 patient per center per period . This figure round 50 patient per center per period ( integrate lose follow-up patient ) . We therefore intend include 2000 patient study . Once required 50 inclusion reach give center give period , inclusion stop center end period . Methods main endpoint analysis . The proportion patient least one ADE observe intervention group compare observe control group . A hierarchical logistic regression model develop make comparison , period , arm , cluster , handle fixed effect , order strategy , individual residual error handle random effect . To assess efficacy intervention test slope regression line statistically different 0 . Methods secondary endpoint analysis . The analysis secondary endpoint perform use methodological framework take account cluster period effect linear model ( continuous variable ) Poisson ( rate ) , depend type outcome analyze . Any comparison baseline variable ( consider cluster structure study ) base Mantel-Haenszel Wilcoxon sign rank test . Methods medico-economic analysis The analysis perform accord payer 's perspective horizon time 30 day , result estimate incremental cost effectiveness intervention , express cost per ADE avoid : [ hospital cost ( intervention ) - hospital cost ( control ) ] / [ number ADEs ( intervention ) - number ADEs ( control ) ] .</detailed_description>
