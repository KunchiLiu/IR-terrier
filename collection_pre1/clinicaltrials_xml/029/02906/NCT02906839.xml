	<detailed_description>Sleep apnea syndrome ( SAS ) common often undiagnosed disorder associate substantial cardiovascular morbidity mortality . SAS prevalence atrial fibrillation ( AF ) 20 % 75 % . SAS associate myocardial fibrosis electrical remodel favor recurrence AF despite medical treatment atrial ablation . Proportion patient SAS high patient high-frequency paroxysmal AF persistent AF low frequency paroxysmal AF . Furthermore , untreated SAS double risk recurrence AF electrical cardioversion . Noteworthy , , give large number potential candidate , patient AF screen SAS despite recent international guideline . Observational study suggest treatment SAS prevent recurrence AF episode randomise trial demonstrate adequate level evidence . In addition , SAS treatment continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) proven efficacy pathology cardiovascular outcome stroke less extend hypertension . In several country include France , CPAP reimburse national health service . However data cost effectiveness SAS treatment standpoint cardiovascular health cost study AF . Limits small randomize study observational cohort fairly illustrate recent result randomize trial , SERVE-HF study , raise question central SAS treatment mortality systolic heart failure patient . This multicentre randomize trial show difference global mortality group , even increase OR cardiovascular death patient treated central SAS . In context , need randomize trial AF , data safety monitor board , even important confirm result observational study . Our hypothesis SAS screening ( SAS-treatment screen positive ) patient present recurrent AF decrease risk recurrence AF , therefore decrease associate health cost . SAS largely under-diagnosed AF patient screen recommend despite lack high level-evidences efficacy SAS treatment AF recurrence , still low resource term SAS screen absence cost-effectiveness analysis . The investigator propose study design patient randomize SAS screen two group : - control group receive usual care follow-up AF ; - intervention group benefit screen SAS treatment relevant ( moderate severe SAS define apnea hypopnea index ( AHI ) &gt; 15/h ) , addition usual treatment AF . The cost-effectiveness systematic screening SAS AF never study despite personal economic burden SAS treatment . The investigator analyze consequence direct medical cost systematic SAS screen treatment patient AF whether SAS therapy would decrease healthcare resource utilization cost , via decrease AF recurrence . The main aim project assess effect SAS screening ( treatment SAS moderate severe , define apnea hypopnea index &gt; 15 / h ) recurrence AF twenty-four month follow-up period , patient optimal medical treatment AF ablation . A 2 group parallel , randomize ( 1:1 ratio ) , Prospective Open Blinded Endpoint ( PROBE ) , multicentric control trial superiority . The control group receive usual care follow-up AF . The intervention group benefit screen SAS treatment relevant , addition usual treatment AF . To minimize cross control intervention group , patient control group perform polygraph end 2 year follow . Both group stratify center . SAS diagnosis perform polygraphy score use international criterion ( American Academy Sleep Medicine 2012 ) . If AHI &gt; 15/h , treatment start , continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) mandibular reposition device ( MRD ) base type severity SAS . Both group follow 24 month cardiologist , somnologist / pulmonologist patient treat SAS .</detailed_description>
