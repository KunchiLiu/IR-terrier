	<brief_title>Evaluating Pharmacokinetics , Safety , Tolerability Bedaquiline HIV-Infected HIV-Uninfected Infants , Children , Adolescents With Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This purpose study evaluate pharmacokinetics ( PK ) , safety , tolerability bedaquiline ( BDQ ) combination optimize background multidrug-resistant tuberculosis ( MDR-TB ) treatment regimen HIV-infected HIV-uninfected infant , child , adolescent . The study enroll HIV-infected HIV-uninfected child 0 18 year age treat clinically diagnose confirm intrathoracic ( pulmonary ) MDR-TB certain type extrathoracic MDR-TB . Participants assign cohort base age . Cohort 1 include child 6 year age old less 18 year age ; Cohort 2 include child 2 year age old less 6 year age ; Cohort 3 include child 0 month age old less 2 year age . Cohort 1 divide two weight band , one participant weigh 15 kg less 30 kg one participant weigh 30 kg . Study visit occur enrollment ( Day 0 ) Weeks 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 20 , 24 , 32 , 40 , 48 , 60 , 72 , 96 , 120 . Participants Cohort 1 take BDQ day first 2 week . For next 22 week , BDQ take three time week . Dosing Cohorts 2 3 determine base data Cohort 1 . Study visit may include physical examination , blood urine collection , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , medical history review , assessment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Parent/legal guardian willing able provide write informed consent study participation ; addition , applicable per local Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) /Ethics Committee ( EC ) policy procedure , participant willing able provide write assent study participation . Age enrollment : Cohort 1 : 6 year age old young 18 year age Cohort 2 : 2 year age old young 6 year age Cohort 3 : 0 month age old young 2 year age Weight enrollment : Cohort 1 : At least 15 kg Cohort 2 : At least 7 kg Cohort 3 : At least 3 kg Documented HIV status define protocol HIVinfected participant HIVuninfected participant . Either confirm probable multidrug resistant tuberculosis ( MDRTB ) : Confirmed intrathoracic ( pulmonary ) MDRTB , without one follow form extrathoracic tuberculosis ( TB ) : Peripheral TB lymphadenitis Pleural effusion fibrotic pleural lesion Stage 1 TB meningitis Miliary abdominal TB , Other nondisseminated form TB disease More information criterion find protocol . Initiated optimized background MDRTB regimen per routine treatment decision , least two week 12 week prior enrollment , tolerate regimen well enrollment . If HIVinfected : Initiated acceptable antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) regimen define either zidovudine ( ZDV ) + lamivudine ( 3TC ) + abacavir ( ABC ) nevirapine ( NVP ) + 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTIs ) least two week prior enrollment . If male engage sexual activity could lead pregnancy female partner : Agrees use barrier method contraception ( i.e. , male condom ) throughout first 28 week study ( i.e. , four week discontinuation bedaquiline [ BDQ ] ) . If female reproductive potential , define reach menarche undergone document sterilization procedure ( hysterectomy , bilateral oophorectomy , salpingotomy ) : Negative pregnancy test screening within 48 hour prior enrollment . If female , reproductive potential ( define protocol ) , engage sexual activity could lead pregnancy : Agrees avoid pregnancy use least two follow contraception method throughout entire period study participation : condom , diaphragm cervical cap , intrauterine contraceptive device ( IUCD ) , hormonalbased contraception . It require method would initiate time study entry . Among Cohort 3 participant , documentation estimate gestational age birth le 37 week . Note : Infants bear HIVinfected woman eligible enrollment Cohort 3 regardless feed mode receipt antiretroviral drug ( ARVs ) prevention perinatal transmission . A clinically significant active medical condition concomitant severe ( Grade 3 high ) illness rapidly deteriorate health condition ( exclude TB ) , include immune deficiency ( exclude HIV infection ) , , opinion site investigator , would worsen participation study would prevent appropriate participation trial , would make implementation protocol interpretation study result difficult , otherwise make participant poor candidate clinical trial . Known presume severe extrapulmonary manifestation TB , include Grades 2 3 TB meningitis , osteoarticular TB . Pregnant lactating . A significant cardiac arrhythmia require medication history heart disease ( heart failure , coronary artery disease ) increase risk Torsade de Pointes . Mean QTcF interval great 460 m ( mean value QT interval , correct use Fredericia correction , electrocardiogram [ ECG ] perform triplicate ) . Clinically relevant ECG change include limited pathological Qwaves ( define great 40 m depth great 0.40.5 mV ) ; evidence ventricular preexcitation ; evidence complete incomplete leave bundle branch block right bundle branch block ; evidence second third degree heart block ; intraventricular conduction delay QRS duration great 120 m ; agerelated bradycardia define sinus rate less low limit indicate protocol . Known personal family history long QT syndrome . Having Grade 2 high follow abnormality time screen know within 30 day prior enrollment accord DAIDS Table Grading Severity Adult Pediatric Adverse Events ( `` DAIDS AE Grading Table '' ) , Version 2.0 , November 2014 : Absolute neutrophil count Creatinine Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) Total bilirubin , 1.5 time upper limit normal accompany Grade 2 high increase liver function test ( LFT ) Retesting screen abnormality list may do long screening period 30 day observe . The last/latest value use purpose final screening decision . Having participate clinical study investigational agent device , within eight week prior enrollment . Currently take disallow medication specify protocol . If take disallowed medication , `` washout period '' three day prior entry require .</criteria>
