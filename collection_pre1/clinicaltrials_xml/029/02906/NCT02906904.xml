	<brief_summary>Non Rapid Eye Movement ( NREM ) sleep parasomnias ( sleepwalk sleep terror ) frequent disable sleep disorder characterize arousal specifically slow wave sleep ( SWS ) dissociate brain activity may relate low nociceptive state . The investigator recently report frequent subjective complaint chronic pain , migraine headache wakefulness adult sleepwalker . They also describe frequent analgesia severe injure episode , suggest relationship dissociate brain activity nociceptive dysregulation . However , study include objective nociceptive measure retrospective assessment perceive pain parasomnia episode lifetime span might also introduce recall bias . The aims present study measure objective pain sensitivity patient NREM parasomnias match control 1 ) parasomniac episode , 2 ) light NREM sleep SWS , 3 ) wakefulness . Fifteen adult severe NREM parasomnia 15 age sex-matched control recruit . A 25 hour ( 8 AM 9 AM ) sleep deprivation protocol follow auditory stimulation SWS use trigger parasomniac episode . Thermoalgic stimulation graduate intensity apply wakefulness ( 8 PM ) determine nociceptive threshold . During recovery sleep follow sleep deprivation , investigator apply repeat subthreshold thermoalgic stimulation NREM stage 2 , SWS trigger parasomniac episode report behavioural/neurophysiologic nociceptive response . The investigator hypothesize low nociceptive threshold wakefulness sleepwalker decrease arousabiliy SWS parasomniac episode . This study may help good understand etiology mechanism underlie clinical enigma nociceptive dysregulation NREM sleep parasomnias .</brief_summary>
