	<brief_summary>This open-label , Phase II , single center trial pembrolizumab ( MK-3475 ) , lenalidomide dexamethasone subject high risk Multiple Myeloma ( hrMM ) post high-dose chemotherapy autologous stem cell transplantation ( ASCT ) . Patients high-risk MM define one follow abnormality undergone induction therapy follow single tandem melphalan -based ASCT consider eligible .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab + Lenalidomide Post Autologous Stem Cell Transplant ( ASCT ) High-risk Multiple Myeloma ( MM )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective trial establish progression free survival ( PFS ) ASCT follow consolidative therapy pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide dexamethasone evaluate safety pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide dexamethasone follow ASCT . The immunological analysis cell cytokine pre post-therapy determined patient bone marrow aspirate peripheral blood sample exploratory objective . The overall composition gut microbiome also determine patient stool sample . Patients follow response , EFS/PFS/OS safety endpoint every 3 week basis . Bone marrow aspirate specimen obtain screen complete study peripheral blood specimen obtain monthly basis evaluate correlative study .</detailed_description>
