	<brief_summary>The primary purpose study investigate effectiveness brief mindfulness-based intervention target chronic physiological underarousal post-concussive symptom follow mild head injury ( MHI ) , self-reported undergraduate university student . For purpose study , MHI define ( identify ) demographic questionnaire traumatic-based injury head - `` Have ever hit head force sufficient alter state consciousness '' ( consistent Kay et al. , 1993 criteria/definition ; American Congress Rehabilitation Medicine - ACRM ) . The investigator exclude congenital genetic injury .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Seventy subject , age 17 30 year old , Brock University recruit participate study . The ability speak write English requirement . University student invited participate study series individual group testing/training session ( n ≤ 15 ) five separate occasion ( two test session three train session ) . The testing/training session average , one week apart ( depend availability participant ) . Participants invite review consent form prior first test session via e-mailed recruit . At time , discussion student 's potential allergy sensitivity take place review 'Potential Risks ' . Participants give two copy write consent form complete ( one copy give participant copy researcher ) . Subjects advise alternate arrangement make prefer 'same sex ' researcher . All participant administer protocol questionnaire order . These test well-researched standard administration time applied . During first session ( pre-test ) , participant greet individually session lab set Jack Nora Walker Lifespan Development Centre test facility Brock University . The consent form read aloud participant researcher clarification , participant invite ask question time time throughout study . Participants undergo 3-minute physiological record complete two performance-based neuropsychological measure : Trail Making Test ( TMT ) measure cognitive flexibility Colour-Word Interference Test measure attention . For physiological measure , subject introduce Polygraph Professional ( 2008 ) equipment measure heart rate , electrodermal activity ( EDA ) , respiration blood pressure . Silver-silver chloride pad use collect EDA , place index fourth finger participant 's non-dominant hand . Electrodermal activation ( EDA ) responses measured term amplitude ( i.e. , height electrodermal response measure microsiemens [ µS ] ) . A pulse oximeter place middle finger participant 's non-dominant hand measure HR . Respiration record via two pneumatic chest band - upper place around chest low , around abdomen clothe . Blood pressure measure via blood pressure cuff place brachial artery/upper portion individual 's left arm . All core equipment cleanse alcohol swab use ; researcher provide participant antibacterial lotion prior application electrode ; electrode replace need . The sanitary procedure explain subject implement ( e.g. , experimenter 's use glove , use cleanse disinfected equipment use alcohol , etc. ) . In addition , participant ask complete self-report rating his/her arousal level physiological activity record ( use , example , Baker Good [ 2014 ] , participant show scale ( 1 10 ) laminate sheet ask provide self-report rating current arousal state ( 1 - e.g. , relax 10 - e.g. , stress ) . Subjects seat give time rest prior , , recording . Participants ask remain still relax comfortable position ( reduce physical movement ) record take 3- minute period . All physiological data record cod alphanumerically without personal identifier . Following physiological recording , Trail Making Test administer , subject ask connect series number lettered dot accord specific set rule . Subsequently , Colour-Word Interference Test administer , subject ask read aloud colour ink various colour word print . All neurocognitive test administer time constraint dictate test protocol . The participant accompany separate ( nearby ) room complete selection self-report questionnaire group test environment ( i.e. , 14 participant ) . Note : BDI-II score immediately student complete test ( i.e. , immediately leave test session ) . During group test session , participant ask complete selection untimed , self-paced self-report questionnaire measure follow : psychopathology - e.g. , depressive anxiety symptom ( Beck Depression Inventory [ BDI ] , Beck Anxiety Inventory [ BAI ] ) ; executive functioning ( Behavior Rating Inventory Executive Function - Adult [ BRIEF-A ] ) ; trait mindfulness ( Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire [ FFMQ ] ) , personality characteristic ( HEXACO Personality Inventory - Revised [ HEXACO-PI-R ] ) lastly demographic ( Everyday Living Questionnaire ) , include measure post-concussive symptom ( Post-Concussion Symptom Scale [ PCS ] ) . The first session expect take approximately 1.5 hour complete total . Following completion first test session , participant instruct sign-up cognitive training session , take place within one week follow pre-test session . Participants randomly assign either mindfulness training session ( experimental group ; n = 35 ) relaxation training session ( control group ; n = 35 ) . Both mindfulness training group relaxation train group meet approximately 30 minute week , across three separate training session . Participants greet group session lab set Jack Nora Walker Lifespan Development Centre test facility Brock University . Participants mindfulness training group partake interactive training session , involve learn core mindfulness-related concept , well engage progressively advanced mindfulness exercise . Note : For exercise involve consumption food product , participant notify advance ( immediately exercise ) food product involve exercise . Participants caution take consideration food allergy and/or dietary restriction may - precaution take risk food allergy minimize ( e.g. , select food nut-free ) . Following formal mindfulness session , participant instruct complete daily `` homework '' exercise ( approximately 5 minute per day ) , accessible handout audio recording Brock University Sakai site . Participants ask complete online questionnaire ( take approximately one minute complete ) day record detail regard daily mindfulness practice . The procedure relaxation training session similar mindfulness session . Participants relaxation train group partake interactive training session , involve learn link stress cognition , well engage progressively advanced relaxation technique focus reduce anxiety stress prior cognitively-demanding task . Following formal relaxation session , participant instruct complete daily `` homework '' exercise ( approximately 5 minute per day ) , accessible handout audio recording Brock University Sakai site . Participants ask complete online questionnaire ( take approximately one minute complete ) day record detail regard daily relaxation practice . At end every training session ( mindfulness group control group ) , participant ask complete short self-report questionnaire , measure state mindfulness ( i.e. , Toronto Mindfulness Scale [ TMS ] ) . During final session ( post-test ) , participant greet individually session lab set Jack Nora Walker Lifespan Development Centre test facility Brock University . The post-test session follow procedure pre-test session ( describe earlier ) . Participants complete physiological , neuropsychological , self-report measure describe pre-test session , two exception : ( 1 ) short version Everyday Living Questionnaire ( attach Post-Concussion Symptom Scale ) use assess change post-concussive symptom since first test session . As well , athletic , educational , familial , pre-test medical history information reassess . The post-test session take approximately 1.5 hour complete . Upon completion study ( end post-test session ) , participant debrief nature purpose study , thank participation . Overall , participation study exceed 6 hour . Included debrief form counsel contact information Brock University Counselling Services negative emotion surface result participation study . Participants also receive contact information principal investigator/faculty supervisor , principal co-student investigator . Finally , participant thank time participation , invite review result study completion ( August 2017 ) .</detailed_description>
