	<brief_title>Concordance Inivata Liquid Biopsy With Standard Care Tissue Testing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim study evaluate performance Inivata liquid biopsy analysis compare standard tissue biopsy analysis detection genomic alteration patient advanced lung cancer . Once select study full inform consent , patient blood draw allow detection cancer-related genomic alteration detectable within blood sample . These result compare result obtain genomic profiling via standard tissue biopsy take part routine care help determine whether 'liquid biopsy ' use guide treatment future patient . The result liquid biopsy use guide treatment decision study participant . In addition data-collection treatment receive non small cell lung cancer response treatment first 6 month post tissue blood analysis , though additional visit procedure require patient beyond initial blood draw .</detailed_description>
