If subject return schedule visit , every effort make contact subject . In circumstance , every effort make document subject outcome , possible . The investigator inquire reason withdrawal follow-up subject regard unresolved adverse event ( AEs ) . If subject withdraws study , also withdraws consent disclosure future information , evaluation perform , additional data collect . IDI may retain continue use data collect withdrawal consent . 7 . ASSESSMENTS 7.1 . Safety Safety monitoring study focus unanticipated problem involve risk participant , include unanticipated problem meet definition serious adverse event . 7.1.1 . Unanticipated Problems Unanticipated problem involve risk participant define , incident , experience , outcome meet follow criterion : • Unexpected term nature , severity , frequency give ( ) research procedure describe protocol-related document , IRB-approved research protocol inform consent document ; ( b ) characteristic participant population study ; - Related possibly related participation research ( possibly relate mean reasonable possibility incident , experience , outcome may cause procedure involve research ) ; - Suggests research place participants others great risk harm ( include physical , psychological , economic , social harm ) previously know recognize . 7.2 . Pregnancy Testing Pregnancy test perform required standard care IDI , i.e . woman 's request miss menstrual period . Pregnant woman withdrawn study . 7.3 . Post-Recruitment Illness Patients post-recruitment illness manage accordance standard care Uganda 's public health sector . 8 . ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING 8.1 . Adverse Events During study visit study clinician ass AEs may occur since previous visit . ART toxicities opportunistic infection enter electronic medical record per standard care , well outcomes ( e.g : death , hospitalization ) . The investigator generate submit annual report summarize adverse event . 8.2 . Serious Adverse Events An SAE untoward medical occurrence dose : Results death ; Is life-threatening ( immediate risk death ) ; Requires inpatient hospitalization prolongation exist hospitalization ; Results persistent significant disability/incapacity ( substantial disruption ability conduct normal life function ) ; Results congenital anomaly/birth defect , 8.3 . Severity Assessment This intervention study specific drug investigate . Patients enrol study document detail outcomes occur care IDI clinic . 8.4 . Causality Assessment Since test specific intervention/drug/device causality assess 8.5 . Reporting Requirements The investigator generate submit annual report summarize AEs . Since study test investigational drug intervention , causality assessment applicable , SAEs also report SRC , IRB Uganda National Council Science Technology ( UNCST ) annually aggregate . 9 . DATA ANALYSIS/STATISTICAL METHODS 9.1 . Sample Size Determination Based pre post ART assessment Burkino Faso Uganda anticipate quality life score ( MOS-HIV ) ART naïve patient increase least 15 point physical health summary ( PHS ) baseline 12 month ART use ( 34 , 35 ) . We estimate additional 5 point improvement receiving C4LTM would give 20 point improvement C4LTM 15 point call Life . In already ART estimate improvement establish ART 5 point improvement C4LTM nil access C4LTM . We also estimate 5 point increase mental health score receive C4LTM compare change without C4LTM start ART , low improvement 2 point mental health score already ART . The study power PHS QOL . For power 0.9 precision 0.05 would need minimum 273 arm ( overall 546 ) patient , mean PHS among patient C4L 58.2 compare 55.2 among patient without C4L . We include 10 % LTFUP/mortality rate give sample size 600 . The composition study participant estimate 300 patient Kasanagati 300 patient IDI . With proposed sample size , number depict 90 % power test even small difference mean PHS 12 month group patient without C4L . We also anticipate able detect change MHS QOL sample size . 9.2 . Analysis Endpoints 9.2.1 . Analysis Primary Endpoint Scales measure quality life There numerous measure quality life . For study choose use Medical Outcomes Study ( MOS-HIV ) Health Survey widely use health relate HRQoL measure PLHIV ( 36 ) . A recent review HRQoL measure currently use HIV/AIDS clinical trial find MOS-HIV one two suitable HIV target HRQoL measure [ 2 ] . The measure Functional Assessment HIV Infection ( FAHI ) ( 37 ) . The MOS-HIV scale choose validate various setting include Uganda , Luganda language version , find useful assess HRQoL PLHIV ( 38-40 ) . In HIV population Uganda MOS-HIV report Crohnbach 's α coefficient &gt; 0.70 five eight multi-item scale factor analysis support underlying physical mental health dimension ( 38 ) . In addition , measure self-administered ≤10 minute . The MOS-HIV measure HRQoL 11 area : health perception , bodily pain , physical function , role function , social function , mental function , vitality , health distress , cognitive function , QoL , health transition . One score scale range 0-100 high score imply good health ( 41 ) . In addition subscales , Physical Health Summary score ( PHS ) Mental Health Summary score ( MHS ) calculate . Intra patient QoL score compare use Paired T-tests overall change investigate . The effect calendar time QoL life score account analysis . Furthermore , change effect intervention different sub-groups HIV positives patient carry . For example , subgroup group analysis type duration ART exposure , time ART initiation , gender difference category . All analysis use robust standard error account individual patient level variances/correlations , well cluster ( facility ) correlation . The effect intervention also compare IDI Kasangati site . All analysis conduct use STATA , USA.Analysis Secondary Endpoints . Analysis secondary endpoint 1 . We undertake analysis MHS discuss primary endpoint ( PHS ) 2 . We undertake intention treat analysis virological outcome ( logistic regression ) 6 , 12 24 month . A viral load &gt; 50 c/ml consider virological failure 3 . We undertake intention treat analysis lose follow ( Cox regression ) . Lost follow define attend appointment &gt; 3 month . 4 . We compare knowledge HIV , ART associate health condition deliver message health tip section Call Life UgandaTM arm 6 , 12 24 month Call Life UgandaTM use . We add additional question MOSHIV tool adapt key population . 5 . We assess perception attitude Call Life UgandaTM tool thorough focus group discussion Key informant interview , target special population . We use purposeful sampling continue new theme emerge . We use NVIVO software cod theme . 6 . Cost analysis along study evaluation ; appropriate detailed cost evaluation also perform . It anticipate intervention prove effective , cost effective analysis would contribute develop sustainable scale strategy similar service across Uganda . The overarch research question address evaluation would : A ) From societal health care perspective , Call Life UgandaTM intervention , comparison usual care , preferable term cost , effect utility ? B ) What incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ( ICER ) Call Life UgandaTM comparison usual care ? C ) In comparison usual care , Call Life UgandaTM intervention preferable term cost utility remain life expectancy study population ? ( model base economic evaluation ) . 7 . We undertake intention treat analysis attendance ( Cox regression ) . Failure attend define attend appointment within 3 work day schedule attendance arm . 8 . For primary outcome , undertake sub-analysis follow group ; 1 . Pregnant woman already receive ART start ART . 2 . Male female positive partner discordant couple already receive ART start ART Call Life UgandaTM 3 . Male female young people ( age 15 24 year ) already receive ART start ART Call Life UgandaTM 4 . Male female patient already receive second line ART start second line ART Call Life UgandaTM 5 . Adult patient start ART We intend report study use standard reporting method randomize trial ( COHORT ) also follow newly publish mERA guideline report mHealth tool include outcome table ( 33 ) . Radomisation Patients randomly assign either one two arm , , without CDL . To ensure patient arm represent equally balanced arm , study use stratify randomization category patient start study form stratum interest . Within stratum , patient randomly assign C4L C4L . Randomization list wil generate independent statistician kept lock key two site . 9.3 .
