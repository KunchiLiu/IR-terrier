	<criteria>Have undergone first allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( alloHSCT ) donor source use bone marrow , peripheral blood stem cell , cord blood hematologic malignancy . Recipients nonmyeloablative myeloablative conditioning regimen eligible . Clinically suspect Grades II IV acute GVHD per MAGIC guideline , occur alloHSCT condition regimen antiGVHD prophylactic program . Subjects steroidrefractory acute GVHD , define follow : Subjects progressive GVHD ( ie , increase stage organ system new organ involvement ) 3 day primary treatment methylprednisolone ≥ 2 mg/kg per day ( equivalent ) . Subjects GVHD improve ( ie , decrease stage least 1 involve organ system ) 7 day primary treatment methylprednisolone ≥ 2 mg/kg per day ( equivalent ) . Subjects previously begin corticosteroid therapy lower dose ( least 1 mg/kg per day methylprednisolone ) develop new GVHD another organ system . Subjects tolerate corticosteroid taper , , begin corticosteroid 2.0 mg/kg per day , demonstrate response , progress 50 % decrease initial start dose corticosteroid achieve . Evidence myeloid engraftment ( eg , absolute neutrophil count ≥ 0.5 × 10^9/L 3 consecutive day ablative therapy previously use ) . Use growth factor supplementation allow . Has receive 1 alloHSCT . Has receive 1 systemic treatment addition corticosteroid acute GVHD . Presence GVHD overlap syndrome per NIH guideline . Presence active uncontrolled infection . An active uncontrolled infection define hemodynamic instability attributable sepsis new symptom , worsen physical sign , radiographic finding attributable infection . Persisting fever without sign symptom interpret active uncontrolled infection . Known human immunodeficiency virus infection . Active hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) hepatitis C virus infection require treatment risk HBV reactivation . Subjects whose immune status unknown uncertain must result confirm immune status enrollment . Serum creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dL creatinine clearance &lt; 40 mL/min measure calculated CockroftGault equation . Subjects evidence relapse primary disease , subject treat relapse alloHSCT perform . Unresolved toxicity complication ( acute GVHD ) due previous alloHSCT . Any corticosteroid therapy indication GVHD dose methylprednisolone equivalent &gt; 1 mg/kg per day within 7 day enrollment . Severe organ dysfunction unrelated underlying GVHD , include : Cholestatic disorder unresolved venoocclusive disease liver ( defined persistent bilirubin abnormality attributable GVHD ongoing organ dysfunction ) . Clinically significant uncontrolled cardiac disease include unstable angina , acute myocardial infarction within 6 month Day 1 study drug administration , New York Heart Association Class III IV congestive heart failure , circulatory collapse require vasopressor inotropic support , arrhythmia require therapy . Clinically significant respiratory disease require mechanical ventilation support 50 % oxygen . Currently breast feed . Received Janus kinase inhibitor therapy alloHSCT indication . Treatment JAK inhibitor alloHSCT permit . Treatment investigational agent , device , procedure , within 21 day ( 5 halflives , whichever great ) enrollment . Subjects participate GVHD prophylaxis study condition regimen discuss sponsor 's medical monitor enrollment . Any condition would , investigator 's judgment , interfere full participation study , include administration study drug attend require study visit ; pose significant risk subject ; interfere interpretation study data . Known allergy , hypersensitivity , intolerance study medication , excipients , similar compound .</criteria>
