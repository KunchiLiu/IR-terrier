	<brief_summary>Dental treatment individual diabetes mellitus , particularly type 1 diabetes ( T1DM ) , always represent challenge dentist . The literature provide scientific evidence show diabetes risk factor occurrence oral opportunistic infection , abnormal bone metabolism delay tissue repair , vary degree evidence . Hyperglycemia , well diabetes , know risk factor post-surgical infection , maintain glycemic control postoperative period standard health care . However , study impact glycemic control repair process tooth extraction . And , knowledge , n't evidence infection result oral surgery frequent individual diabetes antibiotic prophylaxis need individual invasive dental procedure . Some prospective study show people diabetes , especially type 2 ( T2DM ) , exhibit high frequency complication repair process tooth extraction compare healthy individual without diabetes . Recently , study conduct Fernandes et al. , 2015 , find high frequency delay epithelial cover alveolus 21 day tooth extraction individual T2DM , compare control group . Delay related infection day 60th surgery , alveolus totally epithelized . One author 's hypothesis delay alveolar epithelialization participant T2DM possible reduction Epithelial Grow Factor ( EGF ) saliva individual . Some study already demonstrate reduction salivary detection EGF individual diabetes . There n't prospective study literature disposal , evaluate intraoperative complication tooth extraction teeth already erupt individual T1DM , even post tooth extraction heal chronology epithelialization alveolus relation degree salivary EGF . The aim study evaluate intraoperative event post- tooth extraction healing , regard chronology repair event occurrence postoperative complication individual T1DM compare control group . Besides , study intend relate time complete epithelial cover alveolus EGF collect whole stimulated saliva .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Wound Healing After Tooth Extraction Individuals With Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , longitudinal , case-control study include 30 subject type 1 diabetes mellitus require extraction 1 erupt teeth , make part study group ( SG ) . Other 30 healthy subject , without diabetes mellitus , need tooth extraction make part control group ( CG ) . The group match gender age . This project submit Research Ethics Committee Dentistry College University Sao Paulo participant sign Consent Term . All subject agree participate research sign Consent Term . A questionnaire fill researcher , information obtain direct question participant , contaning demographic data ( gender , age ) , medical history , dental history , medication health problem . After anamnesis , researcher make clinical evaluation oral health see necessity tooth extraction . If indication tooth extraction , periapical radiograph perform . Also , require complimentary blood exam blood count , fast glycemia coagulation factor . Subjects use make use antibiotic least month tooth extraction exclude study . On day surgical procedure , measure , individual SG , quick exam glicated hemoglobin ( A1C ) equipment A1C Now+ Multi-Test HbA1c System Bayer速 . The glycaemia measure equipment Accu-Check速 , tooth extraction appointment post-surgery ( Day 3 , Day 7 , Day 21 , Day 60 ) . The blood pressure also measure tooth extraction . The saliva collection perform surgical procedure , least one hour patient fed . It collect stimulated saliva chew parafilm . In first minute patient normally chew swallow saliva , next five minute saliva produce deposited graduated Falcon tube . Salivary flow go measure expressed mililiters per minute . The collected saliva centrifuge 14000 rpm 15 minute . The supernatant collect freeze -80oC sediment content discard . The saliva analysis measure concentration EGF carry immunoassay use EGF ELISA kit ( Novex速 ) . The EGF concentration express optical density reading sample compare standard curve , aid microplate reader absorption 450nm , follow 570nm wavelength . The Invitrogen human EGF kit solid phase sandwich Enzyme Linked-Immuno-Sorbent Assay ( ELISA ) . A polyclonal antibody specific human EGF coat onto well microtiter strip provide . Samples , include standard know human EGF content , control specimen , unknown , pipetted well . During first incubation , Hu EGF antigen bind immobilize ( capture ) antibody one site . After wash , biotinylated monoclonal antibody specific Hu EGF add . During second incubation , antibody bind immobilized Hu EGF capture first incubation . After removal excess second antibody , Streptavidin-Peroxidase ( enzyme ) add . This bind biotinylated antibody complete four-member sandwich . After third incubation wash remove unbound enzyme , substrate solution add , act upon bound enzyme produce color . The intensity color product directly proportional concentration Hu EGF present original specimen . On day , measure blood pressure , glycaemia A1C , saliva collection , tooth extraction perform . No antibiotic prescribe surgery , prophylactic function . Individuals SG orient feed administer insulin normally . Subjects abnormal laboratorial exam abnormal glycaemia ( 70 400 ) re-evaluated tooth extraction post-pone . The tooth extraction perform dentist experience minor oral surgery , Special Care dentistry center Dental School University Sao Paulo . The subject group agree participate submit conventional extraction technique , technique patient Center . The participant receive intervention tooth extraction patient enrol study , follow : anesthetic block hold sindesmotomy , take periodontal , tooth dislocation aid lift removal tooth forceps . The surgical technique modify depend condition tooth alveolus , perform dental section osteotomy necessary . Finally , curettage socket hold simple suture silk thread 3-0 . At end surgery , blood pressure glycaemia measure . Information surgery procedure record , tooth extract , reason tooth extract ( caries , periodontal disease , orthodontic need ) , time spend surgery , number anesthetic tubes complication . It ask participant press gauze alveolar region 30 minute control bleeding . It prescript analgesic , every 8 hour , 3 day , case pain . The participant receive postoperative write instruction . Evaluation repair possible complication surgical wind hold 4 different moment , day 3 , 7 , 21 60 surgery . These evaluation always perform researcher , train calibrate . Will observe sign symptom edema , erythema , bone exposure , fever , pain analgesic need . Glycaemia measure appointment individual SG . Digitalized periapical radiograph perform day 7 60 . The repair process consider late follow event match period consider normal : day 3- alveolus fill blood clot fibrin ; day 7- alveolus fill granulation tissue ; day 21- complete epithelialization wound ; day 60- alveolus exhibit bone deposition , radiographically observe . In case delay complete epithelialization day 21 , subject accompany consultation every 7 day evaluation . If delay alveolar bone deposition day 60 , subject undergo another monitoring day 90 new radiography evaluation . In case post-extraction infection ( alveolitis ) , set recommend treatment describe Kaya et al. , 2011 , removal infect debris , abundant irrigation saline 0.9 % NaCl curettage . It also prescribe antibiotic , Amoxicilin 500mg Clindamicin 300mg , every 8 hour 7 day , anti-inflammatory , Nimesulide 100mg , every 12 hour 5 day ( Barasch et al. , 2008 ) . The pain evaluate assessed time appointment , Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) , consist direct question patient visual demonstration scale ( Annex A ) , zero total absence pain ten maximum bearable level pain patient . After 60 day surgery , post-operative classified : without complication complication , accord presence absence sign clinical symptom observe . It also classify : without delay delay , accord chronology repair observe . According Cheung et al. , 2001 , follow situation consider post-operative complication : - Acute alveolar infection : characterize pain , erythema , edema , purulent secretion fever ; - Acute inflammation alveolus : characterize pain , inflammation , perialveolar tissue , without purulent secretion fever ; - Alveolitis : characterize persistent throb pain bone exposure . All data transfer Excel spreadsheet analyze descriptively associate . Complications compare two group . Additionally , study group , investigate occurrence complication related A1C , glycaemia surgery day , well EGF saliva . Will hold subject ( SG CG ) least 3 periapical radiograph paralleling technique , tooth require extraction . The first radiograph perform time anamnesis , conventional radiographic film order diagnose need extraction assess condition tooth . The second third radiograph carry use digital sensor , day 7 day 60 , use digital device Soredex DIGORA Optime速 , evaluate alveolar bone repair grayscale concentration capture . For standardization 3 X-rays tooth subject , bite record subject carry silicone always use take radiograph . The alveolus consider repair without delay , day 60 , show complete bone deposition .</detailed_description>
