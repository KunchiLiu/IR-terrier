	<detailed_description>This prospective single center study enroll 200 patient undergo clinically indicate cardiac catheterization stable ischemic heart disease unstable chest pain , also undergo NIRS-IVUS direct coronary imaging culprit lesion base routine clinical indication . The NIRS/IVUS catheter use near-infrared light ( red laser light ) intravascular ultrasound ( sound wave ) identify fatty plaque coronary artery . Standard angiography , near-infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) intravascular ultrasound ( IVUS ) three widely use clinical method image narrow within coronary artery time cardiac catheterization . Independently study , patient agree cardiac catheterization ( angiogram - x-ray picture heart ) possible angioplasty procedure and/or stenting part clinical care . During cardiac catheterization blockage bad enough inflatable balloon attach end thin tube ( call catheter ) position narrowed part coronary artery . The balloon inflate , open artery blood flow easily . After balloon angioplasty procedure , stent may place coronary artery . A stent expandable metal tube help hold artery open blood continue flow artery . If doctor determines blockage indeterminate severity ( ≥20 % -≤70 % blockage ) require NIRS/IVUS assessment well assess severity blockage angioplasty and/or stenting necessary NIRS/IVUS catheter use . If severe non-culprit blockage incidentally identify , may treat discretion operator . After invasive coronary catheterization patient follow Beaumonts standard post procedureal treatment guidlines . Between one day one week invasive catheterization patient return research relate non-invasive coronary Cat scan . A coronary Cat scan repeat 24 month ( 2 year ) ass blockage indeterminate severity identify initial invasive cardiac catheterization . Upon arrival Cat scan nurse ask patient question , insert small tube one patient arm vein . Blood drawn small tub kidney function assess . All Cat scan complete Beaumont Hospital Institutional guideline coronary Cat scan . If significant blockage identify , patient may notify complete additional testing , may include stress test coronary angiogram . If non-cardiac incidental finding note require additional clinical imaging follow , patient primary care physician notify . A study doctor , nurse , research coordinator follow-up patient phone six time five year participate registry . Phone call perform follow interval date index procedure : 6 month ( ± 14 day ) ; 12 month ( ± 30 day ) ; 24 month ( ± 60 day ) ; 36 month ( ± 60 day ) ; 48 month ( ± 60 day ) ; 60 month ( ± 60 day ) ask patient collect major adverse cardiac event . The Plan enrollment period two year .</detailed_description>
