	<brief_title>Noninvasive Neuromodulation Prefrontal Cortex Subjects With Obesity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The hypothesis tDCS successfully engage prefrontal-related neurobehavioral cognitive control system , result decrease eat disinhibition therefore facilitation weight loss weight loss maintenance . To test hypothesis , 6-month randomize , sham-controlled , double-blind , intervention study design . Subjects undergo intervention follow components/phases : 1 . Phase 1 - Target engagement ( one session ) The purpose phase examine whether tDCS reach brain target , dorsolateral prefrontal cortex , influence performance neuropsychology test depend activity region . Results component study provide evidence target engagement . Genomic DNA extract whole blood sequence Catechol-O-methyltransferase ( COMT ) brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) polymorphism genotype . 2 . Phase 2 - tDCS alone ( two week ) During phase participant receive daily tDCS session course two week ( Monday Friday ; total=10 session ) . The purpose phase examine effect modulate activity prefrontal cortex tDCS body weight baseline/weight stable condition . Also analyse change appetite eat behavior . 3 . Phase 3 - tDCS plus hypocaloric diet ( two week ) . During phase participant undergo hypocaloric diet intervention aim achieve 5 % body weight reduction 3 month . The diet individualized basis physical activity level , age participant . This intervention conduct inpatient , well-controlled set guarantee adherence diet . Here diet intervention administer combination tDCS . tDCS applied every day ( Monday , Wednesday , Friday ) course two week . The purpose component examine acute change weight associate tDCS combination diet . Also analyse change appetite eat behavior . 4 . Phase 4 - Follow ( 6 month ) . During phase ( outpatient ) change body weight time assessed evaluate weight maintenance . Subjects ask come back laboratory 1 , 3 6 month . Also analyse change appetite eat behavior .</detailed_description>
