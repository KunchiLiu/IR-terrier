	<brief_summary>Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) severe disease Taiwan cause 7,000 death per year , majorly 70 % cause chronic hepatitis B virus infection . A repeat , long-term , severe chronic hepatitis would possible progress liver cirrhosis HCC . As previous record , might 2 % chronic HBV patient would progress liver cirrhosis , 5 % liver cirrhosis 's patient would develop HCC . In case , HBV patient also might directly develop HCC without liver cirrhosis phase .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) severe disease Taiwan cause 7,000 death per year , majorly 70 % cause chronic hepatitis B virus infection . A repeat , long-term , severe chronic hepatitis would possible progress liver cirrhosis HCC . As previous record , might 2 % chronic HBV patient would progress liver cirrhosis , 5 % liver cirrhosis 's patient would develop HCC . In case , HBV patient also might directly develop HCC without liver cirrhosis phase . Spirulina platensis kind ancient living 3.5 billion year , recognize kind space food National Aeronautics Space Administration ( USA ) contain numerous nutrient , especially vitamin B beta-carotene . Beta-carotene would convert vitamin A help keep health vision , skin , mucosa . With rich source vitamin B , especial B12 almost meal ( animal liver ) , 1.2 gram Spirulina platensis daily uptake would sufficient human daily need , also good source vegetarian . The investigator add B12 test trial secondary endpoint help monitor absorption rate Spirulina platensis human . Otherwise , plant pigment Spirulina platensis would also many bioactivities human healthy . Among bio-activities Spirulina platensis would contain anti-virus , anti-cancer , immune modulation , anti-inflammation , anti-oxidant , improve liver abnormality , liver cirrhosis ability . As previous small scale clinical trial result HBV patient provide Far East Bio-Tec Company , lamivudine combine oral Spirulina platensis would also improve sero-conversion rate HBeAg .</detailed_description>
