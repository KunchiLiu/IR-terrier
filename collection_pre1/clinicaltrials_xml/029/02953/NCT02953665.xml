	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Liraglutide Parkinson 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single center , double-blind , placebo-controlled study enroll 57 participant diagnosis idiopathic PD . Subjects enrol study randomize receive daily self-administered injection liraglutide ( 1.2 1.8 mg , tolerate ) placebo dose range 2:1 study design . Liraglutide approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treat adult Type 2 Diabetes ( T2D ) treat obesity , consider investigational study , approve use patient PD . Liraglutide belong class medication able stimulate receptor glucagon-like peptide 1 ( GLP-1 ) , naturally occur peptide find throughout much brain able increase incretin effect patient T2D , stimulate release insulin . Liraglutide reduce systemic brain insulin resistance , abnormality could help drive PD pathogenesis . Indeed , impaired insulin signal brain cause exacerbate many brain pathology behavioral abnormality see PD . Another GLP-1 agonist , name exenatide , evaluate patient PD , show significant improvement motor cognitive symptom . There reason believe liraglutide may prove superior exenatide treat PD . Eligible participant follow 13 month expect complete 8 in-person visit 1 telephone visit . The study measure liraglutide effect motor ( assessed change MDS-UPDRS part III ) non-motor symptom PD ( assess NMSS MDRS-2 ) 52 week treatment . The secondary outcome include measure association liraglutide 's effect peripheral insulin resistance , PD symptoms safety . Collection blood urine sample obtain monitor drug safety .</detailed_description>
