	<brief_title>Avelumab ( antiPDL1 ) Azacytidine Acute Myeloid Leukemia ( AML )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign study part dose level avelumab base join study . If Part A ( Phase 1B ) , assign dose level avelumab . Up 4 dose level avelumab test . Up 18 participant enrol dose level . If intolerable side effect see participant receive high dose level , next group participant receive low dose group . This continue high tolerable dose avelumab find . If Part B ( Phase 2 ) , receive high tolerable dose avelumab find Part A . Up 40 participant enrol Part B . If Phase 1B participant receive low dose avelumab Phase 2 dose find , dose may increase Phase 2 dose ( high ) . All participant receive dose level 5-azacytidine . Study Drug Administration : Each study cycle 28 day . You receive 5-azacytidine either vein 10-40 minute injection skin Days 1-7 Days 1-5 8-9 cycle . You receive avelumab vein 60 minute Days 1 14 cycle Cycles 1-4 , disease complete remission ( completely disappear ) , whichever come first . When disease complete remission , receive avelumab vein Day 1 cycle . Your health check 2 hour infusion . You give standard drug help decrease risk side effect . You may ask study staff information drug give risk . Length Study : You may receive study drug 24 cycle , long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study follow-up visit . Study Visits : On Day 1 cycle , physical exam , blood collect routine test . Starting Cycle 2 , also EKG Day 1 cycle . Twice weekly Cycles 1-3 , every 2-4 week , blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . On Day 28 Cycle 1 every 1-4 cycle , bone marrow aspirate cytogenetic test check status disease . Your doctor tell procedure . After first cycle treatment , may able receive 5-azacytidine injection infusion outside clinic close home . End-of-Study Visit : About 30 day last dose study drug : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - If doctor think need , bone marrow aspirate cytogenetic test check status disease . Follow-Up : Every 3-6 month 5 year last dose study drug : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . If doctor think need disease gotten bad , may bone marrow aspirate every 6-12 month 5 year last dose study drug . If come clinic follow-up visit , may call member study staff ask . These call last 10 minute time . This investigational study . Avelumab FDA approve commercially available . It currently use research purpose . 5-azacytidine FDA approve treatment myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) . Its use combination avelumab investigational . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 58 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients AML refractory ( salvage 2 ) relapse ( 2nd relapse ) . For patient prior MDS chronic myelomonocytic leukemia ( CMML ) MPN transform AML , therapy receive MDS , CMML , MPN NOT consider prior therapy AML . 2 . Prior therapy hydroxyurea , chemotherapy , biological target therapy ( e.g . FLT3 inhibitor , kinase inhibitor ) , hematopoietic growth factor allow . 3 . Age &gt; /=18 year . 4 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance Status &lt; /=2 . 5 . Adequate organ function : total bilirubin &lt; /= 1.5 time upper limit normal ( x ULN ) ( &lt; /= 3 x ULN consider due leukemic involvement Gilbert 's syndrome ) ; aspartate aminotransferase alanine aminotransferase &lt; /= 2.5 x ULN ( &lt; /= 5.0 x ULN consider due leukemic involvement ) . 6 . Adequate renal function define estimate creatinine clearance &gt; /= 30 mL/min accord CockcroftGault formula ( local institutional standard method ) . 7 . Patients must provide write informed consent . 8 . In absence rapidly progress disease , interval prior treatment time initiation 5azacytidine avelumab least 14 day OR least 5 halflives cytotoxic/noncytotoxic agent , whichever longer . The toxicity prior therapy resolve Grade &lt; /= 1 , however alopecia sensory neuropathy Grade &lt; /=2 acceptable . The halflife therapy question base publish pharmacokinetic literature ( abstract , manuscript , investigator brochure 's , drugadministration manual ) document protocol eligibility document . 9 . Continued 8 ) : Since effect avelumab 5azacytidine may delay , use one hydroxyurea patient rapidly proliferative disease allow start study therapy require washout . Concurrent therapy CNS prophylaxis continuation therapy control CNS disease permit . Patients CNS disease leukemic brain metastasis must treat locally clinically stable least 2 week prior enrollment ongoing neurological symptom relate CNS disease ( sequelae consequence treatment CNS disease acceptable ) . 10 . Females must surgically biologically sterile postmenopausal ( amenorrheic least 12 month ) childbearing potential , must negative serum urine pregnancy test within 72 hour start treatment . 11 . Women childbearing potential must agree use adequate method contraception study 3 month last treatment . Males must surgically biologically sterile agree use adequate method contraception study 3 month last treatment . 12 . Continued 11 ) : Adequate method contraception include : 1 ) Total abstinence line prefer usual lifestyle patient . Periodic abstinence ( e.g. , calendar , ovulation , symptothermal , postovulation method ) withdrawal acceptable method contraception . 2 ) Female sterilization ( surgical bilateral oophorectomy without hysterectomy ) tubal ligation least six week take study treatment . In case oophorectomy alone , reproductive status woman confirm follow hormone level assessment 3 ) Male sterilization ( least 6 month prior screen ) .
