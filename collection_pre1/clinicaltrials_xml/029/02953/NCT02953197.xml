	<brief_summary>Treatment cancer head neck , include oropharyngeal tumour , usually consist combination radiotherapy chemotherapy , although surgery may also play part . Radiotherapy work use high energy x-ray destroy cancer cell . Head neck cancer often respond well radiotherapy first instance proportion patient cure treatment . However , cancer cell destroy combination radiotherapy chemotherapy , patient , cancer come back . Studies suggest efficient kill cancer cell , therefore , good cure rate , achieve increase radiotherapy dose . However , past , possible due side effect . Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy ( IMRT ) new radiotherapy delivery technique allow well shape dose area need irradiate potential few side effect . If investigator use IMRT deliver intentionally high dose radiation ( call boost ) small select area whilst , time give standard treatment dos remain area , approach call IMRT dose-painting . These select area identify scan call 18F-FDG-PET ( 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography , also know 'PET ' scan ) type scan give information activity cancer . The purpose study find whether investigator use IMRT dose-painting boost dose region inside tumour appear active 18F-FDG-PET . If study show approach well-tolerated , investigator may able improve cure rate treatment . This would need test subsequent study .</brief_summary>
