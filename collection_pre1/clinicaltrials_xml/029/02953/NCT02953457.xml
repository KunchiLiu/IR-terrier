	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose olaparib give together durvalumab tremelimumab see well work treat patient ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer BRCA1 BRCA2 genetic mutation come back responded treatment . Drugs , olaparib , may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth kill tumor cell BRCA1 BRCA2 mutation . Monoclonal antibody , durvalumab tremelimumab , may help stimulate immune system different way attack stop tumor cell grow . Giving olaparib durvalumab tremelimumab may work well treat patient ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety toxicity combination PARP inhibitor olaparib anti-PDL1 antibody durvalumab anti-CTLA4 antibody tremelimumab . ( Phase I ) II . To assess impact combination olaparib durvalumab tremelimumab progression free survival ( PFS ) rate . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess impact combination olaparib durvalumab tremelimumab anti-tumor immune response patient recurrent platinum sensitive resistant refractory epithelial ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer carry germline and/or somatic BRCA1 BRCA2 mutation . II . To assess impact combination olaparib durvalumab tremelimumab PFS overall survival ( OS ) patient recurrent platinum sensitive resistant refractory epithelial ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer carry germline and/or somatic BRCA1 BRCA2 mutation . OUTLINE : This phase I , study olaparib durvalumab tremelimumab follow phase II study . Patients receive olaparib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) , tremelimumab intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour durvalumab IV 1 hour day 1 . Treatment olaparib continue 1 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Treatment tremelimumab repeat every 4 week 4 course treatment durvalumab repeat every 4 week 13 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 90 day , every 2 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
