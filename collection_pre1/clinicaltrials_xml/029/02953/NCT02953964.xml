	<brief_title>Memory Encoding Strategies People With Mild Cognitive Impairments</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>People dementia experience cognitive decline affect functional performance . It identify encode less effective people dementia . Rehabilitating encode stage , therefore , essential . A recent systematic review find effective intervention need include train individually select memory encode strategy . These strategy classify either perceptual ( visual ) semantic ( association ) memory encode strategy . Based literature , chief investigator ( Associate Professor Karen Liu ) run pilot study integrate home community centre cognitive training programme 20 elderly people memory problem use pre-test post-test comparison design . Extending positive result , aim project investigate effectiveness perceptual semantic encoding strategy ( compare control intervention ) . It also aim promote understanding memory loss dementia need early intervention family member participant .</detailed_description>
