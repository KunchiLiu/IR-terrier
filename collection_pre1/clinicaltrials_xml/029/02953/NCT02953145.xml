	<brief_summary>Cleft Palate condition affect 1 500 live birth . Current treatment surgery correct underlie anomaly . Children born cleft palate typically undergo surgery age 12 month . Standard way stop surgical bleed include direct pressure use electrocautery ( burn tissue ) . Other product available help lessen blood loss . One include fibrin sealant . Fibrin key component blood clot . When fibrin sealant apply variety potential benefit bleed control . One decrease pain post operatively It investigators belief use fibrin sealant , Tisseel , cleft palate surgery decrease pain enhance recovery child undergo cleft palate repair . The propose study randomly select child undergo cleft palate repair tisseel use incision . Through statistical test 40 child recruit ( 20 tisseel use 20 tisseel ) . The use tisseel know surgeon recovery room ward nursing staff . Post operatively , FLACC pain scale use score pain child throughout admission Stollery child 's hospital . The amount pain control medication require well time discharge also record . Statistical analysis data perform use accept method . Overall , investigator hope show fibrin sealant , tisseel , less amount post operative pain experience child undergo cleft palate repair .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Use Fibrin Sealant Reduce Post Operative Pain Cleft Palate Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cleft palate condition affect 1:500 birth . Current practice child enrol multidisciplinary care team undergo primary cleft palate repair 12 month age . These child admit hospital overnight observation airway compromise , bleed analgesic . The use fibrin sealant gain popularity use pediatric surgery become commonplace . It act hemostatic agent well adhesive . A review current literature fibrin sealant show adult child may decrease post operative inflammation pain . In 1994 Moralee et al publish use fibrin sealant tonsillectomy patient lieu diathermy result decreased pain early post operative period equally effective hemostatic method . Another study publish 2005 healy et al show fibrin sealant apply donor site thigh split thickness skin graft patient experience significantly less pain 14 day study period . Tisseel safe product use appropriately . It contraindicate injection intra-arterially allergy . It derive plasma however viral transmission show occur product . A full product monograph available . It investigators hypothesis use tisseel pediatric patient undergo cleft palate repair result decrease post operative pain . The propose study prospective randomize control trial . The control group electrocautery primary method hemostasis control treatment group tisseel apply incision . The primary outcome study post operative pain . Secondary outcome amount analgesic require hospital admission , time discharge , time first feeding , minor complication rates- infection , dehiscence , respiratory compromise , long term sequelae- oronasal fistula formation , need revision , velopharynegal insufficiency . Statistical calculation sample size determine 16 patient need group . This calculate base alpha 0.05 power ( beta ) 0.8 . Statistical significance set p &lt; 0.05 . Recruitment direct parents/guardians patient undergo cleft palate repair . Details study explain parent pre-operatively . Currently pediatric plastic surgeon Stollery Children 's Hospital use tisseel repair technique however investigator concrete data suggest clear benefit procedure . Two surgeon enrol patient perform surgery independently without assistance resident and/or medical student . After informed consent primary decision maker , patient randomize , via consealed envelop , tisseel use electrocautery use hemostatic mechanism . The parents/guardians blind randomization . The operating room staff know result randomization need prepare Tisseel product . All health care provider care patient recovery period blind randomization . Post-operative pain score determine use FLACC ( Face , Legs , Activity , Cry , Consolability ) score system . This system validate objective pain score system use young child post procedure . Patients assessed standard fashion . Pain score analgesic medication give record per current nursing policy well study record place patient 's chart . Parents show assess FLACC score patient discharge prior 72 hour , parent guardian ask record FLACC score certain time point . The record time first feeding record study record form . Patients discharge hospital current criterion safe discharge meet . Clinic follow conduct current standard method surgeon 's discretion . It note patient 's hospital chart enrol study order track long-term outcome list . Student t-test use compare outcome data . Demographic parameter collect validate randomization study group . Age time surgery , associate congenital malformation include cleft lip prior orthodontic surgery/interventions record stored password protect data storage device . Results study make available parent/guardians study patient . It estimate study require one year recruitment data collection primary outcome .</detailed_description>
