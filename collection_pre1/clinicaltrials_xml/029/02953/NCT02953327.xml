	<brief_summary>The propose test innate immune training pilot study 40 adult &gt; 50 year age people Guinea-Bissau . The hypothesis BCG vaccination associate increased innate immune training measure increase cytokine release vitro Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells ( PBMC ) stimulation e.g . Mycobacterium Tuberculosis , Staphylococcus Aureus , Candida Albicans Streptococcus Pneumoniae .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Testing BCG ( Bacille Calmette-Gu√©rin ) Vaccination Can Induce Innate Immune Training Adult People Above 50 Years Age Guinea-Bissau</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BCG develop vaccine tuberculosis ( TB ) , many study confirm ability induce potent protection infectious disease child . It recently show may link increased response innate immune system several non-specific pathogen BCG exposure , call 'innate immune train ' . This training ability BCG show child young adult . However , knowledge , study ability BCG induce innate immune training adult &gt; 50 year age conduct . Immune train elderly interest since increase age , immune system get weak , respond less adequately number infection , instance influenza . Thus , BCG able stimulate innate immune system mature adult well , could potentially reduce risk serious infection elderly . To investigate whether BCG innate immune training effect mature adult , randomize pilot study 40 adult &gt; 50 year age Guinea-Bissau conduct . The Bandim Health Project conduct multiple large-scale RCT 's demographic surveillance . HIV negative adult &gt; 50 year age recent HIV survey eligible present study . They check clinical sign TB HIV test preform enrolment . Exclusion criterion BCG vaccination within last 10 year , illness within last 14 day , clinical sign active TB , and/or positive HIV test . Those overtly ill treat referred hospital need . Those sign TB refer TB hospital examination . Those become HIV positive since test survey receive immediate counselling refer HIV clinic . Participants randomize either BCG vaccination placebo . To test innate immune system blood withdraw 3 time : intervention , 2 week 3 month intervention . There maximum 10 ml blood time , plus 3 ml first time Quantiferon . This small volume , maximum 33 ml cause problem participant . Quantiferon result use baseline test participant sensitize mycobacterium Tuberculosis . In blood , innate immune training effect BCG investigate study immune cell respond stimulate bacteria pathogen , cause serious infection . Provided BCG show induce innate immune training adult &gt; 50 year age , large randomize control trial follow see BCG vaccination reduces number acute infection adult &gt; 50 year age Guinea-Bissau .</detailed_description>
