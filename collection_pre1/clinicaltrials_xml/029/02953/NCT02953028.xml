	<brief_summary>Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) condition patient 's breathing cease sleep due collapse oro-pharynx . The consequence reduce quality sleep , increase risk develop cardiovascular disease increase risk accident cause daytime sleepiness . Among Norwegians 30-65 yr , prevalence OSA estimate 16 % . The golden standard OSA-treatment Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ( CPAP ) . This effective must use life . However , CPAP-treatment might uncomfortable patient , poor compliance result . An alternative Mandibular Advancing Splints ( MAS ) , perceive less troublesome may initiate high compliance . Through map patient characteristic , researcher investigate patient-type benefit two different treatment-devices . The aim study assess MAS treatment differ CPAP treatment respect efficacy , compliance impact health relate quality life among patient diagnose mild/moderate OSA . All OSA patient refer Ear- Nose- Throat-department ( ENT ) University Hospital , Northern-Norway ( UNN ) invite participate study . The sample size completion study 140 patient . Participants trial randomly allocate two treatment group , assess 4 12 month treatment . Data collect anamnesis , clinical examination , clinical photo , radiograph questionnaire concern general health relate quality life ( SF36 ) , oral health , cognitive aspect ( HADS ) , sleep quality ( PSQI ) , daytime sleepiness ( Epworth 's Sleepiness scale ) compliance .</brief_summary>
