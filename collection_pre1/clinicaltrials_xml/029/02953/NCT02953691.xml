	<brief_summary>The overall objective proposal explore association administration prebiotics GOS ( trade name : Bimuno Travelaid ; generic name : B galacto-oligosaccharides ) pain , anxiety , cognitive function perioperative period . The investigator ' central hypothesis subject consume GOS perioperative period demonstrate low level salivary cortisol , , operative procedure . In addition , investigator expect subject consume GOS low perceive level anxiety perioperative period . Finally , investigator hypothesize subject consume perioperative GOS perform better test cognition postoperative period . Such find would beneficial administration GOS perioperative period offer safe inexpensive adjunct current medical management perioperative anxiety .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exploring Impact Perioperative Galacto-Oligosaccharides ( GOS ) Stress , Anxiety Cognition</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AIM 1 : In anterior cervical decompression fusion ( ACDF ) subject , explore association prebiotics , anxiety , pain . Studies recently elucidate link certain prebiotics low perceive anxiety well biomarkers stress . In aim investigator explore association consumption prebiotics relationship perioperative anxiety / physiological stress response . The investigator hypothesize subject receive prebiotics lower perioperative anxiety stress versus control measure standardized survey biomarkers . Furthermore , investigator hypothesize low anxiety result lower postoperative pain score . AIM 2 : In ACDF patient , explore association GOS post-operative cognitive dysfunction . Stress anxiety know impair cognitive function . In addition , preclinical study , administration distinct keystone bacterial strain improve cognitive function anxious mouse model . In human , prebiotics probiotic show ameliorate stress response . In aim investigator seek explore association prebiotics perioperative cognitive outcome human . The investigator perform cognitive function test use time-tested battery use department study post-operative cognitive decline ( POCD ) . Subjects test cognitive function preoperatively ( T1 ) 1.5 month post-op ( T4 ) . The investigator hypothesize patient receive prebiotics perioperative period show less post-operative cognitive dysfunction control . A total 8 subject recruit Neurosurgery Clinics Duke University Health System . The target population include subject undergoing ACDF . Exclusion criterion include : pregnant woman , age &lt; 21 year , diagnosis depression , mental behavioral disorder , recent anxiolytic use , long-term opiate use , oral contraceptive use , recent antibiotic use .</detailed_description>
