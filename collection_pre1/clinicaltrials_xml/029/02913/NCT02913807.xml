	<brief_title>Traditional Versus Computerized Mandibular Reconstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Since introduction microvascular repair refinement technique , free tissue transfer become gold standard head neck reconstruction . Outcomes free tissue transfer also show financially favorable healthcare system improve quality life patient . The fibula osteocutaneous free flap establish workhorse mandibular reconstruction , provide large amount bone inherently thick cortical stock make ideal option create new mandible . Reconstruction mandible utilizes lock reconstruction plate secure vascularize bone position . Paramount successful mandibular reconstruction accurate contour plate restore aesthetic projection occlusive status patient . Computer-assisted , customized reconstruction plate along osteotomy jig ( Stryker , CMF ) in-use mandibular reconstruction . The customized reconstruction plate similar traditional plate except instead bend proper position , manufacture properly bent configuration . The stated benefit device would accurate contour result accurate restoration aesthetic projection face , well postoperative occlusive status , decrease operative time . This pilot study propose determine variation mandibular reconstructive outcome compare conventional technique manually bent stock reconstruction plat new method utilize pre-surgical planning customized/patient specific plating . While customized reconstruction plate jig study , head-to-head comparison versus traditional , hand-bent plate manually-cut osteotomy . The commonly use technique Boston Medical Center bend plat manually , however technique use consider standard care . All patient qualify reconstruction tumor ablation , per investigator institution 's tumor board recommendation eligible . Recruitment subject enrollment adhere IRB requirement . Patients enrol pilot study randomize free hand computerize group ( N=10 arm ) . All patient undergo preoperative photograph standard format . Those free-hand group undergo mandibular reconstruction use fibula free flap . The bar hand contour time surgery osteotomy estimate performed hand PI per usual technique . Those undergoing computerized reconstruction undergo presurgical computerize planning osteotomy reconstruction bar . The remainder procedure go per PI 's usual procedure mandibular reconstruction use fibula free flap . Postoperative treatment two group differ current standard care occur accord PI 's postoperative protocol . At six month , patient undergo CT scan evaluate osteotomy distance amount bony contact present . Measurements out inner gap capture well averages two . All subject arm match number osteotomy amount bony defect per procedure . Information regard length total procedure well time specific reconstruction ischemia time ( time clamp blood vessel take flap leg reconnecting neck , thus re-vascularizing flap ) flap collect . Also cephalometric analysis perform evaluate aesthetic result . See data section detail . All data collect organized statistical analysis perform two group . Significant difference report .</detailed_description>
