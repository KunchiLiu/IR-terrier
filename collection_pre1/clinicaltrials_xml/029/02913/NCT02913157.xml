	<detailed_description>In patient primary progressive multiple sclerosis ( PPMS ) ongoing slow continuous loss nerve cell , cause damage brain spinal cord . This ultimately become noticeable slowly continuously worsen disability . While cause ongoing damage unknown , appear least part damage may cause cell brain call `` microglia '' ( type immune cell reside brain spinal cord ) . These microglial cell beneficial role , instance clear away debris , also cause damage brain cell . In PPMS , microglial cell often find state activation , currently believe constant activation microglial cell likely important cause ongoing damage brain cell . Current treatment MS work relapsing-remitting MS , prevent relapse , far treatment effectively target PPMS . Therapies PPMS need . The investigator believe treatment target reduce activation microglial cell may useful treatment strategy . Hydroxychloroquine ( HCQ ) medication show decrease activity human microglia laboratory experiment . Animal experiment also show treatment HCQ reduce disease activity animal model MS. HCQ , therefore , may also reduce activity microglia people PPMS , hopefully prevent slow progression disability PPMS . HCQ currently approve Canada treat malaria rheumatic disease Systemic Lupus Erythematodes ( SLE ) Rheumatoid Arthritis ( RA ) . HCQ available tablet usually take two time per day . Doses 600mg per use clinical practice , investigator estimate dose 400mg daily , give two dos 200mg , sufficient decrease activity microglia patient PPMS . HCQ usually well tolerate . Following MinMax Simon-2-stage design , study require 35 patient complete 18 month follow-up . Presuming 20 % drop-out , investigator anticipate recruit 42 patient . The trial conduct follow : patient continuously enter study 35 patient complete 18 month follow-up least 75 % adherence measure study drug count .</detailed_description>
