However , scale involved 18 different image , complicate routine use parent , nurse primary health care physician . 4 . Because `` good '' , Bristol Stool Scale worldwide use describe stool infant young child . Pediatricians continuously repeat idea `` something adapted young child develop '' . This recently express symptom score develop awareness tool cow 's milk allergy . Method far - do 1 . The idea replace drawing adult stool use Bristol stool scale real picture real stools infant and/or young child , toilet train , thus wear diaper . 2 . The principal investigator ask nurse take picture stool hospitalize infant young child several month . Pictures hundreds diaper contain stool take . The principal investigator select 28 picture , collaboration nurse staff member , best represent 7 stool describe Bristol scale . 3 . These 28 picture send first core-group ( Hania Szajewska ( Poland ) , Annamaria Staiano ( Italy ) , Carmen Ribes-Konickx ( Spain ) , Christophe Dupont ( France ) , Raanan Shamir ( Israel ) ) , select seven `` best picture '' represent best original description Bristol Stool Scale .
