	<brief_summary>Acquired Brain Injury ( ABI ) damage brain cause head injury illness/disease stroke aneurysm . ABI often associate poor awareness ongoing symptom damage brain , cognitive , physical , psychological . A multi-disciplinary rehabilitation programme recommend help symptom . However , without self-awareness difficulty , people ABI poor motivation take part . The study aim discover whether show people short 'preparatory ' video ABI rehabilitation effect self-awareness , motivation take part rehabilitation offer . The study also aim investigate feasibility use preparatory video large scale across inpatient ABI rehabilitation , explore whether staff find deliver video easy incorporate routine practice . People invited take part study recruit specialist inpatient brain injury rehabilitation unit ( BIRT ) . People approach give information study involve , choose take part . Each participant ask fill series questionnaire . They support staff watch short video every two/three day , twelve week . Half participant show video right away , half wait six week , allow comparison group . The video aim improve understanding kind emotional and/or practical difficulty may experience , inform participant rehabilitation might like . After regularly watch video twelve week set participant ask complete another set questionnaire , staff ask complete evaluation find deliver video .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study repeated-measures design , lag control group , allow within- between-subjects analysis . The primary outcome variable motivation rehabilitation ( Motivation traumatic brain injury rehabilitation questionnaire - MOT-Q ) . Secondary measure include measure awareness ( Awareness Questionnaire - AQ ) behaviour change ( The Pittsburgh Rehabilitation Participation Scale - PRPS , participation statistic ) . Tertiary outcome assessment feasibility preparatory material intervention , complete BIRT staff ( Structured Assessment Feasibility measure - SAFE ) . Primary participant recruit brain injury inpatient unit Glasgow provide Brain Injury Rehabilitation Trust ( BIRT ) , information record case note . This include demographic , information brain injury , cognitive profile , participation statistic relate attendance BIRT rehabilitation programme . Primary secondary outcome measure ( MOT-Q , AQ ) complete . Participants randomly stratify ( time since admission , motivation rehabilitation ) two groupsÍ¾ intervention control . All participant view preparatory video 1:1 delivery member BIRT staff every 2-3 day period 12 week , control group delay exposure 6 week . During delay period , control group continue receive routine care BIRT rehabilitation staff . BIRT staff record number video schedule watch participant . Primary secondary outcome measure ( MOT-Q , AQ ) complete inpatient participant mid- post-trial allow exploration effect within-group comparison , between-group comparison control group . Staff participants complete AQ PRPS pre- post-trial . Routine participation statistic record staff gather pre- post-trial . Additionally , staff evaluate feasibility deliver protocol , complete SAFE questionnaire post-trial .</detailed_description>
