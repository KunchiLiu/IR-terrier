	<brief_summary>Exercise intervention prevent dementia delay cognitive decline gain considerable attention recent year . Human animal study demonstrate regular physical activity target brain function increase cognitive reserve . Although initial study indicate enhanced cognitive performance patient mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) follow exercise intervention , little known effect extensive , control regular exercise regimen neuropathology patient MCI . The aim study compare 12- month aerobic exercise programme versus stretch tone ( non-aerobic ) programme versus control group progression cognitive decline MCI . It hypothesize MCI-related decrease cognitive psychomotor function show less progression even improve one-year aerobic exercise intervention compare group patient undergo stretch tone exercise well control group provide intervention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This randomise controlled clinical intervention study take place across three European site ; German Sport University Cologne , Germany , University Nijmegen , The Netherlands Trinity College Dublin , Ireland . Seventy-five previously sedentary patient clinical diagnosis MCI recruit site . Participants randomise one three intervention arm . One group receive standardise one-year extensive aerobic exercise intervention ( 3 unit 45min / week ) . The second group complete stretch toning ( non-aerobic ) exercise ( 3 unit 45min / week ) third group receive usual care . Change outcomes measure baseline ( T0 ) , six month ( T1 ) 12 month ( T2 ) .</detailed_description>
