	<brief_title>Movement Pattern Training People With Intra-articular , Prearthritic Hip Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Significance : Intra-articular , prearthritic hip disorder ( PAHD ) result substantial dysfunction young adult propose precursor hip osteoarthritis . The number surgical procedure treat PAHD grow exponentially past decade , despite lack high level evidence guide treatment decision . The potential exist surgery become standard treatment rigorous investigation treatment option complete . This trend may partially due lack evidence relate rehabilitation . Although author believe rehabilitation improve function people PAHD , others state rehabilitation contra-indicated recommend surgery best option . There publish clinical trial support refute either opinion , therefore little known comparative effectiveness rehabilitation . Innovation : The investigator ' long term goal develop effective treatment strategy people PAHD improve function prevent delay onset OA . Movement pattern train innovative rehabilitation approach design reduce stress hip joint optimize biomechanics functional task task-specific instruction . Preliminary work suggest abnormal movement pattern may associate PAHD movement pattern training may effective treatment approach , however comparison standard rehabilitation complete . Purpose : This study design assess feasibility conduct multicenter randomize clinical trial ( RCT ) determine efficacy movement pattern training compare standard rehabilitation people PAHD . Participants enrol Washington University University Pittsburgh randomize one two treatment group , movement pattern train standard rehabilitation . In addition assess feasibility trial , preliminary estimate effect size treatment outcome obtain preparation future definitive trial . Post-treatment improvement patient-reported function measure Hip disability Osteoarthritis Outcome Score hip adduction motion functional task , propose mechanistic factor associate PAHD assess . Upon completion study , investigator position implement multicenter RCT definitively assess efficacy movement pattern training . Impact : Ultimately , movement pattern training determine effective , provide relatively inexpensive alternative surgical intervention . Further , theoretical concept movement pattern training could use possibly serve role injury prevention , well optimize post-surgical outcome require surgery .</detailed_description>
