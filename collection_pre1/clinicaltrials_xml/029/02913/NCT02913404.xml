	<brief_summary>The purpose study asses functional biomechanical outcome patient report outcome measure follow single bundle ACL reconstruction ( ACL-R ) compare single bundle ACL reconstruction extra articular tenodesis ( ACL-R+EAT ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ACL-reconstruction v ACL-reconstruction With EAT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Screening Protocol All participant express interest study receive screen interview determine eligibility participation study . The screening surgical patient perform one clinical research coordinator clinic Dr. Musahl . Potential participant pass screen interview provide copy informed consent form ( person via email ) . The potential participant review consent form detail member clinical team order ensure participant understands information contain consent form provide opportunity participant ask question study . If potential participant agree participate , consent form sign participant member clinical team . Surgical Protocol Baseline test surgery consist IKDC objective subjective score , KOOS score , Marx activity level , Lysohm Scale VR-12 . A radiologist grade clinical MRI ACL , meniscus , MCL , LCL , ALC injury . Quantitative pivot shift test perform anesthesia use PIVOT technology inertial sensor . Intraoperative grade ACL injury concomitant injury articular cartilage meniscus perform . If deem eligible final randomization occur follow intraoperative grading . Standard single bundle anatomic ACL reconstruction perform subject . Quadrupled hamstring tendon use cortical fixation femur tibia . ACL-R+EAT perform described Marcacci double hamstring tendon leave attached pe anserinus , anatomic tibial tunnel , staple fixation top position , rout graft superficial LCL , staple fixation Gerdy 's tubercle . Concomitant tear menisci root repair indicated . Research Scans After surgery , approximately 6 month , subject undergo CT scan bilateral knee . The CT scan use create volumetric model . These bone model match dynamic biplane x-ray . Subjects also undergo research MRI scan bilateral knee . The MRI scan use generate model knee articular cartilage . Testing Protocol Participants pas screen interview , consent participate study undergo surgical treatment schedule two test session University Pittsburgh Biodynamics Lab , research CT scan MRI scan UPMC Presbyterian . The participant assign study ID number use identify de-identified data associate participant . The study ID number record placed consent form folder remain lock file cabinet Biodynamics Lab . Female participant complete urine pregnancy test Biodynamics Lab prior X-ray , CT MRI scan . The result pregnancy test document either PI Research Assistant retain separate folder identify participant 's Study ID number . Functional biomechanical outcome measure 6 month 12 month use DSX Biodynamics Lab . Data obtain bilateral knee subject perform downhill run cut maneuver task simulate pivoting , task repeat three time ensure capture movement . There 3 static standing trial movement task image knee . Participants test within biplane X-ray system throughout study . Biplane radiographic image knee take 20 surgical patient , randomly assign ACL-R ACL-R+EAT . In patient prep-room Biodynamics Lab , member research team place reflective marker throughout body . Movement reflective marker track use conventional optical motion track equipment ( Vicon MX ) . Novel 's pedar system use measure pressure distribution foot participant dynamic movement trial . Each participant fit elastic sensor insole ( 1.9 mm thickness ) connect data log pack via cable . The cable secure around participant 's legs velcro minimize potential interference movement trial . The data logging pack fit belt sit around participant hip . The data logging pack send data computer system via Bluetooth . All trial perform instrumented treadmill collect ground reaction force 1000 Hz movement trial . This system contain two side-by side 30x180 cm belt . The belt drive independent ( synchronize ) motor system , belt/motor configure rigid platform support multi-axis load cell . This configuration enable assessment three-dimensional foot-ground reaction force ( vertical/ medial/lateral anterior/posterior ) , apply torque center-of-pressure location independently foot . The participant perform activity ankle riser place treadmill belt order image ankle DSX machine . The treadmill belt move ankle trial , use determine ground reaction force . The demographic questionnaire complete PI , Research Assistant Lab Manager place questionnaire folder contain de-identified participant information . This include age , sex , height , weight body mass index ( BMI ) along standard anthropometric measurement use Vicon Nexus motion measurement system . Participants aslo fill follow questionnaire : IKDC subjective , KOOS , SAS97 , VAS , Marx activity level , Lysohm Scale VR-12 .</detailed_description>
