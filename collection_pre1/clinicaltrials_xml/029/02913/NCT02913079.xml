	<brief_summary>Context Rationale : Uninterrupted sit associate increased risk diabetes , heart disease , death , even among people physically active . These relationship likely due increase post-meal blood sugar observe people sit long period ( e.g . &gt; 1 hour ) without interruption . In contrast sitting , stand result large reduction post-meal blood sugar level . Our group recently show sit-stand desk result large ( e.g . 2.5 hour/day ) reduction occupational sitting time . Taken together , finding suggest sit-stand desk may help reduce post-meal blood sugar level . However , yet examine field . Theoretical Approach Objectives : The objective randomize crossover study determine whether people low blood sugar use sit-stand desk , comparison desk use sit . Methods Procedures : Sixteen participant ask wear continuous glucose monitor measure blood sugar level 2 separate condition . During one condition , ask use sit-stand desk sit and/or stand much like 1 workday . During condition , ask work seat desk 1 workday . Participants provide identical meal eat two condition . We hypothesize participant low blood sugar level day use sit-stand desk , comparison day use traditional seat desk . Significance Future Use : If result support hypothesis , would suggest sit-stand desk may useful way reduce blood sugar level people risk diabetes . This could also lead large population-based intervention study health impact sit-stand desk .</brief_summary>
