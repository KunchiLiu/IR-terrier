	<detailed_description>Besides classical cardiovascular risk factor smoke , obesity , elevate cholesterol level diabetes also acute factor potentially trigger acute coronary event . The impact air temperature ( change ) humidity potential relevance . In addition , exercise associate increase oxygen demand myocardium blood pressure another trigger plaque rupture acute onset myocardial infarction . Male patient well patient previous coronary heart disease little regular exercise increase risk . Possible additional mechanism exercise induce myocardial infarction vasospasm change blood clot . Changes ambient temperature ( warm cold ) also induce vasospasm might result reduce perfusion plaque rupture . It seem male patient involve female patient . Taking exercise ambient temperature change consideration , heavy snowfall consecutive snow shovel augment risk acute myocardial infarction . The rationale study test mention constellation environmental factor well potential increase exercise significant independent impact incidence myocardial infarction</detailed_description>
