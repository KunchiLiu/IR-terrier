	<brief_summary>Dysfunctions tight stenosis thrombosis haemodialysis vascular access lead cause hospitalisation ( 20 % ) morbidity chronic haemodialysis patient incur significant related cost estimate one billion dollar USA . Dysfunctions vascular access generally treat conventional angioplasty least invasive procedure , alternative revision surgery . Angioplasty use inflatable balloon various diameter . Different type angioplasty balloon may need break fibrous venous stenosis , particular high-pressure balloon ( 20 atm ) cut balloon . These angioplasty procedure often painful dilation high technical success rate ( 90-97 % ) poor 1-year patency rate , vary 26 64 % depend team mean rate estimate 40 % study include large number patient , require several procedure . These invasive repeat procedure impair quality life patient end-stage renal disease permanent dialysis await kidney transplant vascular access patency vital . Due traumatic effect vessel wall , procedure induce cell proliferation process retrigger neointimal hyperplasia act preserve haemodialysis access key factor development new stenosis hence vicious circle stenosis-angioplasty . For past year , angioplasty balloon deliver anticancer drug ( Paclitaxel , Sirolimus , Everolimus ) develop . These drug , generally use high dos cancer chemotherapy , release small dos medical angioplasty device . During inflation , local release anticancer ( antimitotic ) molecule different layer vessel wall ( Paclitaxel lipophilic hydrophobic ) confers local antiproliferative action without systemic toxic effect associate high-dose chemotherapy . These medical device demonstrate efficacy term increase primary secondary patency rate procedures coronary artery angioplasty , femoro-popliteal sub-popliteal artery angioplasty ( treatment angina low limb arteriopathy ) . These drug-eluting balloon ( DEBs ) also CE mark recommendation indicate AVF anticancerangioplasties , randomise multi-centre clinical trial proven medical effectiveness , particular contribution term patency rate improvement . However , study animal model show significant result regard efficacy neointimal hyperplasia first single-centre clinical trial small sample size appear promise . The key assessment criterion primary patency dilate stenosis one year define patient efficaciously dialyse one year without re-intervention dilate lesion initial angioplasty . The delay occurrence dilation consider ( censored criterion ) . Patients non-evaluable primary endpoint ( death , lose follow-up… ) censor date late news .</brief_summary>
