	<detailed_description>Numerous line evidence suggest intervention confer therapeutic benefit cardiovascular health also associate improvement , preservation , cognitive function . Many researcher health care provider believe `` What 's good heart good brain . '' However , strong scientific evidence need prove hypothesis . The rrAD study 4-arm , multicenter , randomize trial ass effect aerobic exercise training intensive pharmacological reduction vascular risk factor cognitive performance old adult high risk AD , , high blood pressure , family history dementia subjective memory complaint . Furthermore , rrAD examine effect exercise vascular risk reduction brain volume , perfusion , neural network connectivity use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) .</detailed_description>
