	<detailed_description>Despite rapid improvement treatment cutaneous melanoma , little advance therapy uveal melanoma hepatic metastasis , fatal orphan disease establish therapy . Studies Dr. Sato others describe activity selective internal radiation Yttrium90 microspheres ( SIR-Spheres ) .There limited activity single agent immunotherapy drug ipilimumab ( anti-CTLA-4 ) nivolumab ( anti-PD-1 ) . In cutaneous melanoma combination ipilimumab nivolumab clearly synergistic improvement response rate progression-free survival single agent ; however yet establish uveal melanoma . Recent experimental clinical evidence suggest additional synergy radiation therapy immunotherapy . This synergy seem evident radiation give large fraction stereotactic treatment brachytherapy . The investigator explore synergy feasibility study 18 patient receive SirSpheres Yttrium-90 selective internal radiation give hepatic artery two treatment follow immunotherapy combination ipilimumab nivolumab . The immunotherapy give dose schedule establish FDA-approved cutaneous melanoma . Because generally low toxicity Yttrium-90 selective internal radiation therapy investigator feel give full dosage prior full dosage immunotherapy .</detailed_description>
