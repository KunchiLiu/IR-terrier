	<brief_summary>PART I Hormone therapy without definitive radiotherapy metastatic prostate cancer The goal clinical study PART I determine impact radiotherapy treatment combination standard androgen deprivation therapy compare androgen deprivation therapy alone control metastatic prostate cancer . The primary objective : determine disease progression free survival man metastatic ( M1 ) prostate cancer ( PC ) undergo androgen deprivation therapy without definitive radiotherapy primary tumor.The secondary objective : determine disease progression ( local , bone marrow , visceral ) men metastatic prostate cancer ( M1PC ) undergo systemic therapy with/without definitive radiotherapy primary tumor , determine expression number gene analyse 8 : 2 housekeep gene ; integrin subunit αv , β3 , β5 , α4β1 ; 3 EMT marker N-cadherin , E-cadherin , vimentin radiotherapy , radiotherapy time disease progression , determine plasma serotonin ( 5HT , 5 hydroxytryptamine ) . Subgroup analysis locally advanced prostate cancer ( serf control group integrins analysis ) : determine expression number gene analyse 8 : 2 housekeep gene ; integrin subunit αv , β3 , β5 , α4β1 ; 3 epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) marker N-cadherin , E-cadherin , vimentin radiotherapy , radiotherapy time disease progression . PART II Identification genetic determinant disease progression castrate resistance metastatic prostate cancer . The goal clinical study PART II ass feasibility genomic test multidisciplinary clinical management metastatic prostate cancer , gain insight specific genomic signature ( ) progressive metastatic prostate cancer natural course disease span primary tumor metastasis , test 'treatment selection ' and/or 'treatment adaptation ' mean evolutionary pressure represent mechanistic model castrate resistance ultimate treatment failure follow course androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PART I Standard therapy men present metastatic prostate cancer initiation androgen suppression , whereas radiotherapy surgery currently use palliative effort relieve symptom bleed , pain , obstruction . The integration radiation prostate prospectively explore metastatic setting . Although study evidence effect local therapy outcomes metastatic prostate cancer , hypotheses-generating data support concept appropriate question answer context randomized trial . Prospective data show improve outcome men locally advanced prostate cancer undergo multimodality therapy androgen-deprivation therapy ( ADT ) radiation therapy ( RT ) compare systemic monotherapy alone . Continuing spectrum disease , recent data present 2014 European Society Medical Oncology Annual Meeting show improved failure-free survival men clinically positive lymph node receive combination ADT RT versus ADT alone . Several population-based study show improved overall survival men metastatic disease undergo combination local systemic therapy versus standard-of-care systemic therapy alone . Previous study show initial event metastatic site arrival tumor cell rather cluster bone marrow-derived cell . This cell make local microenvironment secondary organ receptive tumor cell colonization stimulate endocrine factor release primary tumor . According , local treatment primary tumor could postpone formation growth distant metastasis ; metastatic prostate cancer may represent heterogeneous population impact local treatment disease progression survival might influence primary tumor characteristic . Many study support importance integrins prostate cancer development progression promote proliferation , invasion metastasis . Targeting specific integrins matrix interaction may provide way prevent metastatic bone prostate cancer . Serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine ( 5-HT ) well-known neurotransmitter mediates wide variety physiological effect . An increase number 5-HT-releasing neuroendocrine ( NE ) cell correlate prostate tumor progression . However , particularly unclear whether release 5-HT release 5-HT role tumor cell growth . Serotonin well-known mitogen mediates wide variety physiological effect via multiple receptor , receptor subtype 1 ( 5-HTR1 ) identify prostate cancer ( PC ) cell line . Recently , 5-HT find show growth-promoting activity functionally relate oncogene . Previous study show 5-HT stimulated proliferation prostate cancer cell mediate 5-HT receptor 5-HTR1A R1B secretion system prostate NE cell capable 5-HT synthesis metabolism play significant role prostate tumor generation progression . These finding crucial development potential drug slow prostate tumor progression . PART II Genomic alternation lead development metastasis , treatment resistance ultimate disease progression include multistep mutational event androgen signal axis , tumor suppressor gene oncogene finally DNA repair defect currently intensively study use large multinational collaborative effort ( Robinson Cell 2015 , PCF Stand Cancer West Coast Dream Team ) . Despite grow body data biology behind different phenotype metastatic prostate cancer see clinic , little known discovery specific gene/pathway involved multi-step process disease progression impact clinical decision , especially limited resource setting . Furthermore , knowledge gap address impact ADT , mainstay treatment metastatic prostate cancer , mutational landscape context hormone sensitive disease . For program start embrace personalise treatment paradigm essential gain insight integrate genomic data clinic even , test whether genomic test course disease patient metastatic prostate cancer feasible . Primary goal PART II study ass feasibility genomic testing pilot group five patient prostate cancer develop metastases large pool patient prostate cancer follow prospectively multidisciplinary clinic . Secondary goal determine level genomic instability principal mutational event metastasis oppose primary tumor , addition differentiate genomic outlook metastasis emergence castrate resistant disease . ( ) Aims 1 , 2 , 3 : To assess feasibility genomic test critical step management patient metastatic prostate cancer characterise genomic signature progressive metastatic prostate cancer In prospectively follow cohort participant prostate cancer , participant develop metastatic disease identify , approach genomic test initiation ADT . The investigator plan characterize genomics metastatic prostate cancer use whole exome sequence single nucleotide variation ( SNVs ) , gene rearrangement ( GRs ) copy number variants/alternations ( CNVs ) . Eligible participant develop measurable biopsiable metastatic disease ( i.e . lymph node bone lesion ) detect use classical radiological stag method ( bone scan , computerized tomography ) regardless underwent primary treatment method ( radical prostatectomy radiotherapy ) . DNA extract archived tissue ( formalin-fixed paraffin embed - FFPE ) biological specimens - either dominant lesion radical prostatectomy diagnostic prostate biopsy metastasis , use approve protocol nucleic acid extraction . Availability radical prostatectomy specimen large metastasis would allow significant amount tissue initial whole exome sequencing ( WES ) primary tumor metastasis ( 200x deep sequence relative 30x normal blood DNA sequencing ) . The plan obtain tissue metastasis onset castrate resistance ( clinically available ) well . Bioinformatics analysis perform obtain panel genomic change encompass whole disease spectrum . The investigator compare clonal signal determine metastatic clone present primary tumor time initial diagnosis , prior treatment treatment-resistant clone present early , initiation therapy metastatic disease . This test concept treatment ( ADT ) -induced selection versus adaptation course ADT develop novel signature SNV , CNV GRs within two level metastases yet clearly define . ( ii ) Aim 4 , 5 : Comparative analysis DNA profile primary tumor metastasis , project might augment knowledge site-specific signature ( ) predictive outcome highly heterogeneous population prostate cancer patient . Translational relevance The result generate proposed work might relevant push towards personalise therapy prostate cancer patient 's management . Currently , personalize approach area patient treat manner regardless underlie biology disease . In case example metastatic prostate cancer ADT primary treatment modality , potential clinical utility genomic signature predict failure hormonal therapy give insight drive mutation disease progression , primary tumor metastasis . Finally , relevant data gather feasibility genomic test multimodal management patient metastatic prostate cancer first time Croatia . There also point assess utility obtain genetic information presumable use targeted therapy make treatment decision real-world clinical set transitional eastern European country emerge pharmaceutical market .</detailed_description>
