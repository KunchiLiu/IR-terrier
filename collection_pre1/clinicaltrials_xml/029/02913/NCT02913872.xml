	<brief_summary>What capacity training need general practice implement routine spirometry eNO test child age 5-16 year ? Asthma common long-term disease childhood United Kingdom ( UK ) . Under-diagnosis under-treatment childhood asthma general practice ( GP ) report several European country include UK . This result poor symptom control increase risk asthma related death . It suggest under- over- diagnosis childhood asthma general practice could improve routinely use objective lung function test diagnosis monitoring . The propose objective lung function test ( spirometry exhale nitric oxide measurement - eNO ) already use routinely UK hospital , usually available general practice child care . Why important ? - Availability test help health professional general practice look child asthma well , hopefully improve asthma control . What study achieve ? - Though believe provide spirometry eNO general practice would beneficial , little data achieve . This study employ qualitative quantitative measure order evaluate resource require implement routine spirometry eNO test child primary care ; investigate impact would diagnosis child suspect asthma . How ? - The investigator work general practice around Leicestershire , UK . Firstly , identify barrier implement test , secondly train practice perform interpret spirometry eNO independently child . Children suspect previously diagnose asthma invite review lung function test . The investigator record time take train general practice perform interpret spirometry eNO independently , additional clinic capacity require provide test .</brief_summary>
