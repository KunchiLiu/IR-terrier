	<detailed_description>This single center prospective imaging study investigate utility hyperpolarized C-13 pyruvate/metabolic MR imaging . The current protocol serve companion image biomarker study pair therapeutic trial PI3K/mTOR pathway inhibitor ( e.g . CUDC-907 , BYL719 ) , well stand-alone protocol patient treat standard-of-care therapy inhibit PI3K/mTOR signal pathway ( eg . everolimus ) . In Part A ( run-in feasibility phase ) , patient undergo image single time point , without paired tumor biopsy . There follow imaging requirement treatment PI3K/mTOR pathway inhibitor . Iterative adjustment radiofrequency coil geometry image sequence undertaken optimize intra-tumoral hyperpolarized pyruvate/lactate signal-to-noise ratio goal achieve signal-to-noise ratio least 10 minimum 3 patient order proceed Part B study . In part B , patient undergo paired baseline hyperpolarized C-13 pyruvate image + tumor biopsy , initiate treatment agent inhibit PI3K/mTOR pathway . After 21 day ( +/- 14 day ) , patient undergo repeat hyperpolarized C-13 pyruvate MR image + tumor biopsy . Patients subsequently treat PI3K/mTOR pathway inhibitor disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , patient/physician decision discontinue therapy .</detailed_description>
