	<brief_title>Vedolizumab Subcutaneous ( SC ) Versus Intravenous ( IV ) Ulcerative Colitis Crohn 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug test study call vedolizumab . Vedolizumab test determine availability reaction body people moderately severely active Ulcerative Colitis ( UC ) Crohn 's Disease ( CD ) . This study look availability reaction vedolizumab people administer treatment subcutaneously ( SC ) compare people administer treatment intravenously ( IV ) . The study enroll approximately 200 patient moderately severely active UC CD . Participants randomly assign ( chance , like flip coin ) one five treatment group : - vedolizumab 300 mg IV - vedolizumab 300 mg IV vedolizumab 160 mg SC - vedolizumab 300 mg IV vedolizumab 108 mg SC - vedolizumab 480 mg SC vedolizumab 160 mg SC - vedolizumab 324 mg SC vedolizumab 108 mg SC All participant receive one treatment assign various treatment visit throughout study . This multi-centre trial conduct North America , Europe Asia . The overall time participate study approximately 41 week addition follow-up survey administer every 6 month 2 year . Participants make 16 visit clinic , include safety follow-up assessment 18 week last dose study drug .</detailed_description>
