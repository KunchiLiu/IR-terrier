	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) lead cause death Argentina death rate continue rise along risk factor CVD . Challenges control low- middle income country ( LMIC ) include low awareness , shortage train health care worker , overcrowd primary care center ( PCCs ) , overall lack resource health care system . Determining way increase screen community setting efficient referral PCCs significant priority reduce CVD burden Argentina . Previous work fund NIH show effective low-cost screening tool available , CHWs train use validate , simple non-lab base screen tool community identify high CVD risk , use mobile phone application tool reduce cost training screen time CHWs . What show whether person high risk CVD appropriately refer proper evaluation , treatment , effective management CVD PCCs . The Ministry Health Argentina institute incentive system REDES Program goal increase number uninsured high risk CVD screen , identify , refer , provide appropriate care treatment essential diagnostics medicine . We propose develop mHealth tool integrates cell phone application risk screen tool wirelessly directly connect electronic schedule system PCCs . This allow CHWs access appointment schedule system government clinic , allow make appointment identify high-risk individual time screen increase number referral follow-up visit individual attend . This integrate scheduling system allow text messaging use remind patient appointment schedule followup care . Finally , system integrate electronic record system PCC ongoing monitoring evaluation program implement . We propose pragmatic cluster randomize trial individual PCCs randomize either use integrated mHealth tool , usual screening procedure use exist paper base screening . The objective determine use mHealth tool increase number high-risk person show referral visit , increase rate subsequent follow-up care visit refer person , cost-effectiveness intervention .</detailed_description>
