	<brief_summary>Fatigue consistently rat top symptomatic complaint individual multiple sclerosis ( MS ) . Currently , MS Fatigue Impact Scale ( MFIS ) , subsection Multiple Sclerosis Quality Life ( MSQoL ) , clinical standard use neurologist monitor track fatigue individual MS . However , fatigue multidimensional phenomenon subjective measure poor limited relationship functional status . While previous study focus contribute factor fatigue sleep disorder diminish cortical excitability , line inquiry neglect role muscle structure function fatigue every day functional task . An alternative approach ass quantitative fatigue use anaerobic test method . However , knowledge need understand role quantitative fatigue play self-reported fatigue measure function daily activity . Our purpose determine association quantitative fatigue test performance-based measure mobility self-reported health-related quality life . Our secondary goal understand intrinsic property muscle tissue influence muscle performance Veterans MS .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Quantitative Fatigue Muscle Performance Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants complete study assessment DC VAMC . Disease severity assess medical staff complete EDSS . Peak torque assessment knee flexor extensor perform isokinetic dynamometer ( Biodex System 4 ) . Muscle morphology measure rectus femoris obtain use diagnostic musculoskeletal B-mode ultrasound ( Phillips EPIQ 7 180 Plus ) 10 Mhz linear transducer . The sonographic measure include muscle thickness echogenicity . The mode exercise test type muscle action influence assessment fatigue . Therefore , isokinetic fatigue measure knee extensor assess separate visit ( least 48 hour apart ) . Performance-based measure function include assessment patient mobility 25-foot walk test . Muscle power estimate timed sit stand test . Subjective measure fatigue quality life include MSQoL , MFIS , Neurology Quality Life Adult Fatigue Bank ( AFB ) .</detailed_description>
