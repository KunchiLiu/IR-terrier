	<brief_summary>Background Significance : The peptide hormone ghrelin drive hunger feed behavior , make focus obesity research . Released mainly stomach proximal small intestine , ghrelin peak prior meal , potentially prim gut anticipated nutrient . After eat , ghrelin abruptly decline , level vary 2- 3-fold fast fed state . Interestingly , obesity type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) , pattern disrupt . Individuals disorder chronically suppress ghrelin level little variation meal . Although ghrelin 's preprandial rise postprandial fall well-established phenomenon , role regulate glucose metabolism unclear . In mouse , increase preprandial ghrelin level improve glucose tolerance enhance glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) secretion . Ghrelin also stimulate GLP-1 secretion mouse human intestinal L-cells vitro . These finding suggest enhance postprandial GLP-1 novel role preprandial ghrelin surge . A ghrelin-incretin enteroendocrine axis could also explain poor postprandial GLP-1 secretion glucose tolerance subject T2D , give preprandial hypoghrelinemia . The investigator ' preliminary data demonstrate human , increase circulate ghrelin supraphysiologic range worsen glucose tolerance , despite increase GLP-1 secretion . The discrepancy finding one rodent could due difference study design and/or specie . For example , investigator ' study use continuous ghrelin infusion , result elevated level ghrelin pre- postprandially . Elevated postprandial ghrelin likely mitigate positive effect increase GLP-1 secretion raising level glucagon counter-regulatory hormone . This study seek delineate interaction ghrelin GLP-1 regulation glucose tolerance , beta-cell function , insulin sensitivity . The investigator hypothesize increase preprandial ghrelin enhance GLP-1 secretion consequently improve glucose tolerance healthy subject T2D . Confirmation hypothesis would advance investigator understand control glucose homeostasis important clinical therapeutic implication . Modulating ghrelin level may provide novel therapeutic strategy improve glucose tolerance individual T2D , affect estimate 350 million people worldwide .</brief_summary>
