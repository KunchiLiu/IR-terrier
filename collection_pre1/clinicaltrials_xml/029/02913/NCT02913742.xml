During traditional temporal lobectomy MTLE , neurophysiologic intraoperative monitoring ( NIOM ) use good identify epileptogenic tissue guide resection . Our study propose investigate utility NIOM LITT MTLE . Subjects draw refractory mesial temporal lobe epilepsy patient determine candidate LITT . During LITT surgery , addition placement stereotactic LITT probe , subject receive second small stereotactic electrode intraoperative monitoring epileptic discharge surgery . After surgery , regularly schedule follow-up , patient receive Quality Life Epilepsy questionnaire ( QOLIE-31-P ) , addition standard post-operative care . Endpoints surgical complication , fractional decrement epileptiform discharge pre- post-ablation recording , surgical outcome 6 month one year . Analysis severe complication express simple complication rate , overall complication , severe complication , hemorrhagic complication specific . The relationship fractional discharge decrement outcome assess regression analysis . Risks study stem placement stereotactic electrode intraoperative monitoring , represent small incremental risk beyond typical LITT MTLE .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Utility NIOM During LITT Refractory MTLE</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy ( MTLE ) common cause medication-resistant epilepsy adult . The standard treatment refractory MTLE surgical resection craniotomy . Stereotactic laser interstitial thermal therapy ( LITT ) new surgical technique use treat MTLE . Under MRI-guidance , laser probe inserted seizure focus heat use destroy tissue . Compared temporal lobectomy , LITT result shorter hospital stay , low complication rate , possibly less cognitive decline ; however , seizure freedom rate potentially low . During temporal lobectomy , neurophysiologic intraoperative monitoring ( NIOM ) use good identify epileptogenic tissue guide resection . This tool unavailable LITT procedure . Recently , investigator demonstrate two case NIOM depth electrode technically feasible LITT identify epileptiform activity intra-operatively . This prospective trial NIOM LITT mesial temporal lobe epilepsy . The investigator assess safety perform NIOM LITT whether data NIOM ( frequency characteristic epileptiform discharge record ablation ) associate seizure outcome . If association , NIOM could use prognostication could potentially even use guide surgery . Hypotheses : 1 . NIOM perform MRI-guided stereotactic depth electrode place parahippocampal gyrus adjacent LITT catheter safe , compare institutional LITT control without NIOM publish LITT complication rate . 2 . Greater magnitude fractional decrement discharge frequency pre-ablation post-ablation recording significantly associate well seizure outcome , measure International League Against Epilepsy ( ILAE ) surgical outcome score . Objectives : The primary project goal assess NIOM parahippocampal depth electrode safe LITT MTLE assess fractional decrement interictal discharge ( ID ) NIOM significantly correlate outcome . The study power address question priori . Post hoc analyse consist multivariate analysis patient demographic data , NIOM finding , operative parameter , quality life score , neuropsychiatric outcome also assess .</detailed_description>
