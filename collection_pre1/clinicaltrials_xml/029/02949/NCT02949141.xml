	<brief_summary>This study design evaluate use lung ultrasound compare chest x-ray diagnose pneumonia Nepal . Given ease , portability , relative ease teach ultrasound , would potential technology available many clinician throughout Nepal use adult pediatric patient present suspect pneumonia . This would especially useful remote area clinician limited access x-ray . Despite utility , use ultrasound diagnose pneumonia resource-limited setting like Nepal yet study . Therefore , study design prospective , clinical diagnostic study evaluate patient present suspect pneumonia use diagnostic imaging beside ultrasound compare chest x-ray use computed tomography gold standard diagnosis pneumonia .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Design : A prospective , convenience sample participant present suspected pneumonia train ultrasound investigator present Patan Hospital Emergency Department perform Patan , Nepal . This study do partnership Patan Hospital Emergency Department approval Nepal Health Research Council Patan Hospital 's ethical review committee . Study Setting : Located Kathmandu valley , Patan Hospital large urban hospital 35-bed Emergency Department see approximately 32,000 patient per year . Study Protocol : Prior enrol patient , investigator Emergency Department save lung ultrasound exam interpret exam . These exam independently review ultrasonographer ensure adequate skill lung ultrasonography . A kappa analysis scan perform . If kappa &lt; 0.6 , review lung ultrasound investigator repeat evaluation kappa 0.6 achieve . For participant meet inclusion criterion , consent obtain participant . Consent include explanation use bedside ultrasound chest CT scan diagnosis condition . This consent also include explanation risk benefit Nepali . These examination provide free charge participant . The investigator record patient demographic , symptom , lung exam finding , pre-test probability pneumonia ( low , intermediate , high ) data form . After initial clinical evaluation , bedside lung ultrasound perform . A Sonosite M Turbo ( Fujifilm Sonosite , Inc. ) ultrasound machine use . The ultrasound examination include ten view , two anterior view , two lateral view ( one include costophrenic angle ) , one posterior view chest wall . The investigator record finding diagnosis data entry form along post-test probability pneumonia ( low , intermediate , high ) . Participants get chest x-ray part standard evaluation . These reading record data sheet . Participants undergo chest compute tomography ( CT ) , diagnostic standard evaluate pneumonia . The chest x-ray chest CT read radiologist . The radiologist blind result previous study . The reading diagnosis accord CT record data form . Statistical Analysis The performance ultrasound diagnosis pneumonia express sensitivity , specificity , likelihood ratio . Since sensitivity ultrasound estimate around 90 % , order detect 20 % difference base CXR sensitivity 70 % , 62 patient need . McNemar 's test use evaluate statistical difference sensitivity CXR US .</detailed_description>
