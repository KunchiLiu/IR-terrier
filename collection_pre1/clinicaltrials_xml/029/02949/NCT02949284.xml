	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well androgen receptor antagonist ARN-509 work without abiraterone acetate , gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist , prednisone treat patient high-risk prostate cancer undergo surgery . Androgen cause growth prostate cancer cell . Hormone therapy use androgen receptor antagonist ARN-509 , abiraterone acetate , gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog ( GnRH agonist ) may fight prostate cancer lowering level androgen body make . Prednisone may either kill tumor cell stop dividing . Giving androgen receptor agonist ARN-509 without abiraterone acetate , GnRH agonist prednisone may work well treat patient prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Androgen Receptor Antagonist ARN-509 With Without Abiraterone Acetate , Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Analog , Prednisone Treating Patients With High-Risk Prostate Cancer Undergoing Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate effect neoadjuvant androgen receptor antagonist ARN-509 ( apalutamide ) without abiraterone acetate , GnRH agonist , prednisone feasibility perform nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy ( RP ) men high-risk prostate cancer ( PCa ) . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 3 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive androgen receptor antagonist ARN-509 orally ( PO ) daily 3 month . Patients undergo radical prostatectomy . ARM II : Patients receive GnRH agonist subcutaneously ( SC ) day 1 , androgen receptor antagonist ARN-509 PO daily PO 4 time , abiraterone acetate PO daily 4 time , prednisone PO daily 3 month . Patients undergo radical prostatectomy . ARM III : Patients undergo radical prostatectomy . After completion study treatment , patient follow 2 year .</detailed_description>
