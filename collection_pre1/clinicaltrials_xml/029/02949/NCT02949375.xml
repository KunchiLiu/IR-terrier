	<brief_summary>Primary objective : To evaluate change serum alanine transaminase [ ALT ] level Day 0 Day 28 , follow daily dos 4.5 6mg GRI-0621 compare placebo , patient chronic liver disease elevate serum level ALT . Serum ALT level use marker liver inflammation . To assess safety tolerability GRI-0621 two dos . Secondary objective : To assess change serum aspartate transaminase [ AST ] level baseline Day 28 , follow daily dos 4.5 6mg GRI-0621 match placebo , patient chronic liver disease elevate serum level AST . Serum AST level use second marker liver inflammation . To evaluate response 4.5mg GRI-0621 versus 6mg GRI-0621 term change serum ALT level baseline measure different trial time point . To assess change serum cytokeratin 18 [ CK-18 ] level baseline Day 28 , follow daily dos 4.5 6mg GRI-0621 match placebo , patient chronic liver disease . Serum CK-18 use marker hepatocyte cell death due either necrosis apoptosis . To measure Natural Killer T lymphocyte [ NKT ] cell activity baseline Day 28 follow daily dos 4.5 6mg GRI-0621 match placebo . To describe steady-state pharmacokinetics [ PK ] GRI-0621 patient chronic liver disease . Exploratory objective : To assess effect , , investigational product may serum triglyceride level .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This multi- centre , double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled phase 2a trial participant age 18 65 year chronic liver disease . It design assess safety , tolerability efficacy 4.5mg 6mg GRI-0621 administer daily 28 day . A total 60 participant randomise receive 4.5mg 6mg GRI-0621 match placebo 1:1:1 ratio . The investigational product administer orally daily morning duration 28 day . Participants return clinic follow-up safety efficacy assessment Days 7 , 14 , 21 28 . Additionally , PK sample perform Days 7 28 , sample immunological assay assess activity NKT cell draw Days 0 ( baseline ) 28 . An end-of-trial follow-up visit perform 14 day last dose investigational product Day 42 . The primary efficacy objective measure change baseline Day 28 serum ALT level . The baseline ALT level calculate mean Day -7 -1 Day 0 serum ALT result . Safety tolerability measure incidence severity adverse event change physical examination finding , physical measurement , vital sign , ECG find standard laboratory safety parameter ( include hematology , clinical chemistry , coagulation parameter urinalysis ) .</detailed_description>
