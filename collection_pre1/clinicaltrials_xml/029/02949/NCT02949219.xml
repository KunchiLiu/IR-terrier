	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab Treating Patients With Small Bowel Adenocarcinoma That Metastatic Locally Advanced Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether pembrolizumab administer small bowel adenocarcinoma ( SBA ) patient demonstrate antitumor activity measure confirm response rate . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess survival endpoint ( overall survival [ OS ] , progression free survival [ PFS ] ) , include stratify analysis tumor site . II . To assess whether pembrolizumab safe SBA patient assess adverse event . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether PD-L1 expression , measure immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) , microsatellite instability ( MSI ) status associate response rate overall . II . To determine Bim level tumor-reactive CD11ahighPD-1+CD8+ peripheral blood T cell objectively monitor response pembrolizumab determine excessive release soluble B7-H1 ( soluble [ ] PD-L1 ) tumor lead Bim upregulation treatment resistance SBA . III . To determine tissue-based factor , total mutational burden , correlate response pembrolizumab . OUTLINE : Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month , every 6 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
