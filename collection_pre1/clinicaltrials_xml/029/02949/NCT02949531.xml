	<brief_summary>Oxygen routinely give patient common condition COPD heart failure . There evidence behind give oxygen patient specifically heart failure due stiff heart . This study aim explore effect oxygen ability patient chronic heart failure ability exercise . Other common variable assess heart rate blood pressure observe response vary concentration oxygen . The concentration choose commonly offer hospital indeed deliver standard equipment find hospital country . It hop study effect short term oxygen patient heart failure help identify effectiveness oxygen long term therapy patient often breathless decrease exercise tolerance .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use Oxygen Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many patient reduce exercise tolerance preserve leave ventricular function . These patient label heart failure preserve ejection fraction ( HeFPEF ) , combine use echocardiography biochemistry . The prevalence incidence HeFPEF increase currently account around 50 % patient diagnosed HF . The last twenty year research lead great improvement available treatment heart failure reduce ejection fraction ( HeFREF ) ; however , current guideline suggest diuretic improve symptom patient HeFPEF : clinical trial several pharmacological intervention fail show convincing reduction morbidity mortality patient HeFPEF . The effect oxygen therapy exercise capacity remain poorly understood HeFREF , time write study , never explore HeFPEF . The investigator recently complete study show increase exercise time , exercise load peak exercise peak metabolic equivalent cycle ergometry 28 % oxygen supplementation increment 40 % oxygen supplementation use patient heart failure reduce ejection fraction . The investigator aim improve exercise time patient HeFPEF oxygen supplementation . Identifying correct dose oxygen aim avoid hyperoxygenation provide adequate oxygen improve exercise tolerance . Patients identified heart failure clinic invite screen visit . Eligible patient three treatment visit least one week apart ( visit different oxygen concentration i.e room air , 28 % 40 % oxygen , randomly determine sealed envelope ) Patients use standard cycle ergometry exercise work load increase every minute 5-10 watt . Patients encourage cycle tire . At end cycling , exercise time , peak metabolic equivalent , work load , shortness breath score note visit .</detailed_description>
