	<brief_summary>The purpose research see whether metformin improve response rate patient undergo chemotherapy radiation squamous cell carcinoma oral cavity , oropharynx , larynx hypopharynx . The purpose research also see effect , good bad , metformin therapy disease . Researchers also analyze tumor blood sample study patient test understand characteristic tumor respond metformin .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I/II Study OF Metformin Combination With Cisplatin Radiation Head Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Information laboratory study retrospective study patient disease show addition metformin ( commonly use medicine treat diabetes ) chemotherapy radiation improve rate cancer respond treatment . Metformin use frequently treatment patient diabetes illness , yet use treat patient type cancer . In research study , want see use metformin treatment chemotherapy radiation increase chance cancer respond treatment return .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Diagnosis : Patients must histologically cytologically confirm squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) oral cavity , oropharynx , hypopharynx larynx . Patients eligible inclusion must stage IIIIV SCC site base current AJCC clinical image base staging . Only patient HPV disease include Phase II component study ; HPV status ascertain use currently utilize clinical standard p16 overexpression via immunohistochemistry . 2 . Disease Status : Only patient active , measurable disease include study . 3 . Prior Therapy : Patients must fully recover acute toxic effect prior chemotherapy , immunotherapy , radiotherapy prior enter study . Patients treat chemotherapy ( i.e . cisplatin ) and/or EBRT cancer different , nonhead neck site , eligible trial . Patients previously treat chemotherapy and/or EBRT cancer head neck region , irrespective histology eligible participate trial . 1 . Myelosuppressive chemotherapy : Must receive within 4 week enrollment onto study ( 6 week prior nitrosourea ) . 2 . Hematopoietic growth factor : At least 7 day since completion therapy growth factor . 3 . Biologic ( antineoplastic agent ) : At least 7 day since completion therapy biologic agent . 4 . Monoclonal Antibody : At least 6 week must elapse since prior therapy include monoclonal antibody . 5 . Other : For agent know adverse event occur beyond 7 day administration , period must extend beyond time adverse event know occur . 6 . XRT : &gt; /= 14days local palliative XRT ( small port ) ; &gt; /= 90days must elapse prior TBI , craniospinal XRT &gt; /= 50 % radiation pelvis ; &gt; /= 45days must elapse substantial bone marrow radiation . 7 . Stem Cell Transplant Rescue : No evidence active graft vs. host disease &gt; /= 2 month must elapse since transplant . 4 . Age : Patients must &gt; /=18 year age . Because dose adverse event data currently available use metformin cancer patient &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study eligible future pediatric singleagent trial , applicable . 5 . Performance Status : ECOG performance status less equal 3 . 6 . Organ Function : Patients must normal organ marrow function define : 1. leukocyte &gt; 3,000/mcL 2. absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/mcL 3. platelet &gt; 100,000/mcL 4. total bilirubin within normal institutional limit 5 . AST ( SGOT ) &lt; /= 2.5X institutional upper limit normal 6. creatinine &lt; 1.5mg/dL OR 7. creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 patient creatinine level &gt; institutional normal 7 . Willingness Use Contraception : The effect metformin develop human fetus recommend therapeutic dose unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . 8 . Informed Consent : Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Concomitant Medications : Patients may receive investigational agent . 2 . Brain metastasis : Patients know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . 3 . Prior Allergies : History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition metformin . 4 . Patients diabetes mellitus ( DM ) exclude study . Criteria diagnosis diabetes mellitus follow : ) know diagnosis DM , b ) active treatment DM , c ) fast glucose level ≥ 126mg/dl ) hemoglobin A1c ≥ 6.0 % obtain within 30 day prior registration . 5 . Intercurrent Illness : Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 6 . Pregnancy : Pregnant woman exclude study metformin US FDA class B agent potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother metformin , breastfeed discontinue mother treated metformin . 7 . HIV : HIVpositive patient combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction metformin . In addition , patient increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Appropriate study undertake patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate . 8 . Patients take metformin reason eligible inclusion study .</criteria>
