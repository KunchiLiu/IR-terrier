	<brief_summary>The human microbiome compose unique group microorganisms occupy distinct habitat distribute throughout human body . The Human Microbiome Project recently evaluate bacterial composition microbiome 18 ( woman ) 15 ( men ) body sit . Much initial attention field microbiome research focus bacterial contribution `` healthy '' microbiome . However , clear microorganism , include fungi virus , also distribute throughout human body serve functional component microbiome . The population microorganisms reside within oral nasal cavity make important contribution human health disease . These contribution may especially important immunosuppressed patient , include patient receive myelosuppressive chemotherapy undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . In patient , organism typically consider commensal become pathogenic , either locally systemically . This observational study primarily undertaken evaluate oral nasal microbiota define population fungal organism reside within oral nasal cavity pediatric oncology patient receive protocol-directed chemotherapy associate supportive care .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Oronasal Microbiota Pediatric Oncology Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants recruit patient population St. Jude Children 's Research Hospital ( SJCRH ) . Participants enrol study accord underlying primary diagnosis : acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) patient undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) . Patients ask provide oral wash nasal swab sample three time point course treatment SJCRH . These sample use characterize comprehensively oronasal microbiota . - Group 1 include 30 patient newly diagnose AML . Within 72 hour start chemotherapy , patient provide oral rinse nasal swab sample . Participants provide two subsequent oral rinse nasal swab sample . The first ( second total oral rinse nasal swab sample ) provide within 7 day completion `` induction II '' therapy . The second ( third total oral rinse nasal swab sample ) collect within 7 day completion therapy . - Group 2 include 30 allogeneic HSCT recipient . Prior begin condition regimen , patient provide oral rinse nasal swab sample . Participants provide two subsequent oral rinse nasal swab sample . The first ( second total oral rinse nasal swab sample ) collect complete condition regimen day +10 ( plus minus 7 day ) . The second ( third total oral rinse nasal swab sample ) collect day +30 ( plus minus 7 day ) .</detailed_description>
