	<brief_title>Aripiprazole Adjunct Atypical Antipsychotics Weight Reduction Improvement Metabolic Profile</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The metabolic syndrome ( MetS ) well describe cluster interrelate risk factor develop cardiovascular disease type 2 diabetes . The main component MetS central obesity , hypertension , hyperglycaemia dyslipidaemia . Individuals MetS two three time likely heart attack stroke five time likely develop type 2 diabetes without . Metabolic abnormality often identify individual schizophrenia . Since introduction second generation antipsychotic , evidence accumulate link metabolic abnormality . An abnormality glucose metabolism , particularly diabetes mellitus ( DM ) , receive attention . Other condition cardiovascular morbidity , abnormal lipid metabolism obesity also serious impact physical health individual schizophrenia . Several pharmacological strategy investigation counter metabolic side effect , antipsychotic Aripiprazole show good evidence , switch monotherapy , also adjunct . The study plan open label study . An open label exploratory design help test hypothesis use adjunct Aripiprazole help reduce weight gain atypical antipsychotic , improve metabolic parameter . The number patient arm design yield 80 % power detect significant difference weight baseline P &lt; 0.05 . There randomisation , blind placebo control , study plan test initial hypothesis , inform RCT 's , result encourage . Participants initially screen ensure fulfil inclusion criterion , eligible participant enter 12 week study , prescribe 5 mg Aripiprazole per day , addition routine atypical antipsychotic . The typical dose range routine atypical antipsychotic clozapine 200-450 mg , olanzapine 5-20mg risperidone 2-16mg respectively . During 12 week study , dose antipsychotic Aripiprazole stay unchanged . If clinical situation warrant change dose antipsychotic switch antipsychotic , participant withdrawn study . Atypical antipsychotic one investigation prohibit , well medication supplement weight loss weight gain , medication know substantial propensity weight change . Benzodiazepines , anticholinergic , sleep aide generally allow . Antidepressants mood stabiliser stable dose , patient receive prior study , allow . Patients high risk suicide self-harm assess study investigator , withdrawn study , well significant side effect adjunct Aripiprazole . The primary objective study assess mean change weight baseline use adjunct Aripiprazole . The secondary endpoint include change metabolic parameter ( waist circumference , fast blood glucose , HbA1c , total , HDL LDL cholesterol level ) .Safety tolerability measure Simpson Angus Scale ( SAS total score ) , Side Effects Checklist , Barnes Akathisia Scale ( BAS ) , Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale ( AIMS ) , adverse event serious adverse event report . The study also evaluate neurocognition via brief battery 2 test - digit sequence symbol coding . These 2 task show previous study explain 76 % variance global neurocognition large sample patient schizophrenia . In local sample , similarly show 2 task valid , represent 72 % variance global neurocognition schizophrenia ( unpublished result ) . The avoidance language component 2 task significant strength choice cognitive task previously show local population tend underperform language-based cognitive task .</detailed_description>
