All adult meet inclusion/exclusion criterion access internet via wireless connection include . Participants consent research study assess initially , 1 month exercise end 2 month exercise . Assessment include questionnaires health history , include fall , physical activity , balance confidence system usability . Participants also complete strength , balance mobility physical performance test . Age , sex , presence comorbidities , medication list , functional ability , balance confidence , fear fall behavior fall history assess questionnaire . Usability tablet-based questionnaire assess questionnaire . Participants test standard clinical test balance gait . Participants closely supervised Doctor Physical Therapy ( DPT ) student training use exercise program . Participants complete full set exercise tablet presence DPT student . The DPT student determine whether participant safe program allow perform program home . If research team determine participant unable exercise safely his/her he/she withdrawn study . The tablet-based , video game exercise program call Health Motion develop Blue Marble Game Company . Health Motion test pilot study find reduce fall risk 8 15 old participant without adverse event .
