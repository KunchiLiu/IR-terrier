	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well targeted therapy work treat patient incurable non-small cell lung cancer genetic mutation . Giving drug target genetic mutation specific protein may work well patient cancer cause driver mutation treatment target mutation stop work .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Targeted Therapy Treating Patients With Incurable Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer With Genetic Mutations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate objective response rate among patient high PD-L1 express cancer failure target therapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare overall survival patient receive treatment target primary mutation , secondary mutation , immunotherapy time progression tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy . II . To assess incidence secondary mutation population accord smoking status . III . To evaluate response rate patient treat use different approach . IV . To correlate outcome specific secondary genetic change . OUTLINE : Patients assign 1 3 treatment arm . ARM I ( PD-L1 &gt; = 50 % ) : Patients receive nivolumab intravenously ( IV ) 60 minute every 2 week pembrolizumab IV every 3 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II ( PD-L1 &lt; 50 % without secondary oncogenic driver ) : Patients receive tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy orally ( PO ) target initial oncogenic driver treatment 3 week . ARM III ( PD-L1 &lt; 50 % secondary oncogenic driver ) : Patients receive tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy PO target initial oncogenic driver , drug target secondary mutation , treatment 3 week . After completion study treatment , patient follow minimum 30 day .</detailed_description>
