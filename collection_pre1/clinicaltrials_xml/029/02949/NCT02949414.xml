	<brief_title>A Study Assess Safety , Tolerability Potential Efficacy Tracheal Replacement Consisting Tissue-engineered Tracheal Scaffold With Seeded Mesenchymal Cells</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase I study evaluate safety , tolerability potential efficacy novel tracheal replacement therapy use cadaveric tracheal scaffold patient mesenchymal cell isolated sample patient bone marrow . The study aim treat patient suffer severe tracheal stenosis malacia conventional therapy longer adequate . A total 4 patient treated course study . A hospital multi disciplinary team review medical history available treatment option potential patient recommend whether suitable study . Once patient approve enter 8 week screening period . During period bone marrow patient harvest manufacture final graft tissue start . The manufacturing facility use cadaveric donate decellularised tracheal scaffold ( supply NHS blood transplant body ) patient cell make final investigational product ( graft ) . The product surgically graft patient place damage tracheal section . The graft support stent first 6 month replacement stent occur week 8 week 16 post-surgical procedure . Hospitalization number day require replacement step . The patient follow frequently post surgery capture safety efficacy measure . Long term follow continue 5 year post surgery .</detailed_description>
