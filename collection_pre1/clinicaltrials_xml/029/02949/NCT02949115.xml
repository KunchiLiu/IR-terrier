	<brief_summary>Aside age , numerous factor increase risk develop cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) include diet nutrition . High-fat meal consumption induce postprandial vascular endothelial dysfunction cardiometabolic disturbance ( e.g . dyslipidemia hyperglycemia ) normal weight individual exacerbate overweight/obese individual . These postprandial response likely largely due activation pro-inflammatory pro-oxidant pathway . Given much day spend postprandial state , may impair cardiovascular health age overweight/obese individual . Interventions attenuate response need . Red beetroot ( Beta vulgaris L. ) excellent source bioactive compound include nitrate , flavonoid , phenolic acid , betalains , carotenoid , ascorbic acid . These bioactive compound metabolites show antioxidative , anti-inflammatory , cardiovascular-protective effect . These effect , particularly cardiovascular-protective effect , primarily attribute high content nitrate since convert nitric oxide independent vascular endothelium via enterosalivary nitrate-nitrite-nitric oxide pathway . However , red beetroot juice contain number potentially beneficial bioactive compound study aim determine whether compound work independently , additively , synergistically exert effect . Given finding previously conduct research broad area red beetroot juice consumption human health , suggest : 1 ) acute red beetroot juice consumption may prevent attenuate adverse postprandial response consume high-fat meal individual exaggerated response ; 2 ) chronic consumption red beetroot may improve underlie factor contribute exaggerated response . Accordingly , project aim : 1 ) investigate efficacy acute chronic whole red beetroot juice consumption compare bioactive component attenuate postprandial vascular endothelial dysfunction adverse cardiometabolic response high-fat meal ; 2 ) gain insight underlie mechanism responsible .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , 4-period , 4-week crossover pilot clinical trial consist 2 postprandial test period . Overweight obese postmenopausal woman men age 40 65 recruit great Fort Collins , CO area . After telephone prescreening , participant report study site first visit ( Screening ) receive verbal write explanation project , provide informed consent , follow screening assessment . Qualified participant schedule baseline visit randomly assign respective treatment . On second visit ( Baseline ) follow overnight fast , anthropometrics blood pressure measure diet physical activity record collect . Subjects ingest respective treatment 10 min prior consume high-fat test meal . Various assessment perform sample collect prior 4 hour post-meal consumption . At third visit ( Final ) , assessment sample collection repeat time point 24 hour consume last dose respective treatment test chronic rather acute effect . Subjects undergo 4-week washout period cross next treatment period . This repeat 4 treatment .</detailed_description>
