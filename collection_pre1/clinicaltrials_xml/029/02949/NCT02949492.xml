	<brief_summary>Regulatory T cell ( Tregs ) suppress cytopathic immune response inhibit transplant rejection . Our goal exploit Treg suppressive property induce transplantation tolerance . In contrast effector T cell , Tregs constitutively express high affinity IL-2 receptor , make exquisitely sensitive low-doses IL-2 . We propose conduct phase II clinical trial test capacity low-dose IL-2 promote selective expansion endogenous Tregs liver transplant recipient time immunosuppressive drug discontinue . We expect promote Treg accumulation within transplant liver , shift balance effector T cell Tregs , facilitate development operational tolerance patient unlikely reach state spontaneously . We expect trial start shortly initiation project provide robust evidence efficacy IL-2 within 47 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Low-dose IL-2 Treg Expansion Tolerance ( LITE )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Transplantation remain successful treatment end-stage organ failure , need administer life-long immunosuppression ( IS ) prevent rejection limit patient survival . Liver transplantation transplantation set sizeable proportion patient spontaneously develop `` operational tolerance '' , phenomenon define maintenance stable graft function absence destructive immune response without need IS . Unfortunately phenomenon preferentially develop elderly recipient several year transplantation . To maximize benefit derive IS discontinuation need find strategy intentionally induce tolerance young recipient accumulate IS toxicity yet occur . Our study reveal successful IS discontinuation associate transient intra-graft immune regulatory response preferential accumulation regulatory T cell ( Tregs ) . This suggest short-term enhancement Treg number and/or function time IS withdrawal may facilitate acquisition tolerance patient predispose spontaneously develop . IL-2 cytokine essential optimal development , survival function Tregs . Several clinical study show low-dose IL-2 preferentially expand Tregs safe efficacious patient autoimmunity GVHD . In study , Treg frequency increase 2 8-fold without significant change number effector T cell . Our objective investigate administration short-course low dose IL-2 liver transplant recipient facilitate discontinuation IS . We propose conduct phase II , safety efficacy , prospective , single-arm clinical trial liver recipient &lt; 50 year old 2-6 year transplantation receive IL-2 gradually discontinue IS medication .</detailed_description>
