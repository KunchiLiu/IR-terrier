	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Prurisol Administered Orally Active Moderate Severe Chronic Plaque Psoriasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study design randomize , double blind , parallel group , placebo-controlled trial study efficacy safety two oral dos Prurisol administer twice daily twelve week subject moderate severe chronic plaque psoriasis . Approximately 189 study participant enrol . Subjects randomly assign one three treatment group 3:3:1 randomization ratio , respectively . - Group A ( n=81 ) : Prurisol 150 mg bid - Group B ( n=81 ) : Placebo - Group C ( n=27 ) : Prurisol 200 mg bid Outpatient subject moderate severe chronic plaque psoriasis candidate systemic therapy phototherapy recruit study . Study participant require Psoriasis Area Severity Index ( PASI ) score ≥ 12 , body surface area involvement ≥ 10 % , static Physician 's Global Assessment ( sPGA ) moderate severe ( score 3 4 ) . A subject study clinical protocol commence screen period 4 week , treatment period 12 week , follow-up period 4 week end End Study evaluation . During treatment , subject return study center every 2 week . Efficacy assessment , include physician patient rat endpoint , measure throughout study . Safety tolerability assess ascertainment AEs result clinical laboratory testing , vital sign assessment , need concomitant medication . At subset site , blood sample determination plasma concentration Prurisol ( abacavir glycolate ) abacavir , 's metabolite , obtain subject consent provide sample . At select site , subject consent photography , standardized digital photograph obtain illustrative purpose .</detailed_description>
