However , clinician often need estimate risk hospital discharge adapt therapeutic choice , proposal post-hospital care , provide reliable fair information patient relative . Estimating simultaneously hazard three event complex . Indeed , death event hinder observation re-hospitalization institutionalization death occur event . The death consider compete risk analyzes . Hospital readmission may modify risk death institutionalization consider intermediate factor event . This complexity account classical statistical model , like logistic regression model . The purpose study use appropriate statistical model ( multi-state model ) good estimate simultaneously risk hospital readmission , institutionalization , death patient give hospitalization AGU , show accuracy estimation improve take account complication occur stay AGU .</brief_summary>
