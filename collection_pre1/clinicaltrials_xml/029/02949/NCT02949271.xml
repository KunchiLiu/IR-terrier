	<brief_summary>The aim prospective , doubled-blinded randomize study compare two mode epidural analgesia delivery , program intermittent epidural bolus ( PIEB ) versus continuous epidural infusion ( CEI ) patient control epidural analgesia ( PCEA ) dosing , provide labor epidural analgesia . The primary outcome volume local anesthetic receive PCEA . Secondary outcomes measure time first PCEA bolus , labor pain score , degree motor blockade , mode delivery , PCEA attempt ratio successful unsuccessful attempt , frequency hypotension , duration first second stage labor level patient satisfaction . The investigator plan enroll 120 nulliparous participant 2-5 com cervical dilation , 60 patient arm . The subject assign receive either delivery epidural medication ropivacaine 0.1 % fentanyl 2mcg/mL PIEB + PCEA dose method CEI + PCEA . Continuous data analyze use Kruskal-Wallis test t-test appropriate . Categorical data analyze use Chi-square test Fisher 's exact test appropriate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Labor pain childbirth regard one painful experience woman 's life potential cause lasting emotional psychological effect . Childbirth also associate development chronic pain prevalence 4-10 % cesarean section 6-18 % vaginal delivery . Hence , effective management labor pain instrumental preventing development life alter chronic pain woman childbearing age . Maintaining epidural analgesia combine local anesthetic opioid consider extremely safe lead superior neonatal maternal short long-term outcome . Historically , maintenance epidural analgesia involve intermittent provider-administered bolus injection , patient control epidural analgesia ( PCEA ) continuous epidural infusion ( CEI ) without PCEA breakthrough pain discomfort . CEI show provide consistent analgesia addition improve patient satisfaction reduce workload anesthesia provider . However , CEI associate great local anesthetic consumption increase maternal motor blockade . Increased motor block associate reduced mobility , decrease pelvic muscle tone impair ability parturient adequately Valsalva second stage labor . Motor blockade also associate increase incidence shoulder dystocia instrumental delivery , precipitate birth trauma fetus mother . Achieving adequate analgesia labor , without compromise motor function critical optimize short-term long-term outcome mother neonate . A novel approach labor analgesia involve administration small , programmed intermittent epidural bolus ( PIEB ) PCEA dose breakthrough pain . Preliminary study indicate PIEB could superior method labor analgesia compare current standard care , CEI . A randomized double-blind study Wong et al . compare CEI PIEB incorporate use PCEA breakthrough pain healthy parturients singleton pregnancy . Results suggest cohort receive PIEB require less local anesthetic use , similar analgesia improve patient satisfaction compare CEI . Additionally , subsequent study Wong et al find healthy , term , nulliparous woman spontaneous labor , extend PIEB interval increase volume decrease local anesthetic consumption , PCEA request rescue analgesia requirement without increase patient discomfort compromise satisfaction . Two subsequent study allocate woman receive either PIEB CEI nulliparous parturients woman terminate pregnancy suggest PIEB recipient experience less motor blockade compare receive CEI . The investigator recently perform systematic review meta-analysis study compare effect labor analgesia either PIEB CEI without PCEA labor woman . The meta-analysis include 9 study evaluate various primary outcome include : patient satisfaction , require manual anesthesia intervention , labor progression mode delivery ( vaginal , instrumental cesarean delivery ) . Secondary outcome include : degree motor blockade , degree sensory blockade , time first anesthetic intervention , local anesthetic dose deliver per hour , pruritus , shiver , maternal fever , nausea vomiting , neonatal Apgar score 1 minute 5 minute , umbilical artery vein pH . PIEB dose local anesthetic associate reduce local anesthetic consumption , decrease require anesthetic intervention , improvement maternal satisfaction comparison labor woman receive CEI . Pooled result indicate PIEB CEI comparable regard duration first stage labor , statistically significant 22 min reduction length stage two labor PIEB . Similarly , review suggest statistically significant difference cesarean delivery rate require anesthetic intervention CEI PIEB . There several limitation preliminarily study . While , 9 study report least one primary outcome list systematic review , none study include primary outcome . Additionally , study involve nulliparous woman , may limit ability apply result multiparous woman . Furthermore , many study involve use two pump , one deliver CEI PEIB another deliver PCEA research setting , involve use non-commercially available research pump . Currently CADD solis v 3.0 pump system upgrade allow co-administration epidural anesthesia PIEB CEI PCEA . This new technology available labor delivery unit Duke University Medical Center standard care since March 2015 . This new pump differs use preliminary study , utilized two-pump approach administer PIEB CEI PCEA labor pain relief . Preliminary study identify optimal PIEB setting , bolus volume , lock interval , drug concentration , represent gap literature present time . The investigator perform retrospective study explore whether PIEB associate reduced LA use , PCEA use rescue analgesia comparison CEI labor woman . The investigator also assess whether PIEB decrease number instrumental delivery reduce motor blockade , serve impediment progression labor . The study divide patient three group . The first receive CEI 5mL/hour , second receive PIEB 5mL every 60 min , third use PIEB 3mL every 30 min . Each group access PCEA set 5 mL bolus 8-minute lockout period maximum 35mL per hour . The result study suggest expect study reveal statistically significant difference LA consumption , amount motor blockade mode delivery patient receive CEI PEIB use single pump system instead two-pump system employ prior study . However , study suggest patient receive PIEB regimen 3mL every 30 minute use low PCEA volume patient receive CEI . Patients receive PEIB regimens attempts/PCEA give CEI patient PIEB 3ml/30 minute group unsuccessful PCEA attempts/hour CEI recipient . This study , unlike prior study compare PIEB vs. CEI PCEA , use concentrated solution consist double concentration half volume bupivacaine . One investigator speculation large bolus dilute LA may improve dissemination epidural space thus improve analgesia . This study interpret PCEA attempts/given number unsuccessful PCEA attempts/hour reflection patient pain discomfort , attempt interpret effort achieve good pain relief . Another way interpret aforementioned PCEA attempt representation amount time patient `` lock '' prevent receive additional bolus PCEA . Hence , limitation study fact patient satisfaction score collect could help distinguish whether attempt reflect lockout period inadequate analgesia . Other limitation retrospective study include fact explicit instruction properly use PCEA standardize , fact patient satisfaction pain score garner due study 's retrospective nature . Probably one significant limitation study fact patient randomize treatment group . Hence , provider choose analgesia receive . On hand , another retrospective study utilize dilute concentration local anesthetic report reduced need physician intervention PIEB compare CEI . The investigator recently switch local anesthetic practice bupivacaine 0.125 % dilute concentration ropivacaine 0.1 % mixed fentanyl 2 mcg/ml . The investigator therefore aim prospectively study use PIEB new epidural solution would associate improved analgesia compare regimen use CEI .</detailed_description>
