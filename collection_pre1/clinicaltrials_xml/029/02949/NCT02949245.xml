	<brief_summary>272 subject `` high risk '' adult spinal deformity require surgical correction enrol previous prospective multi-center international Scoli-RISK-1 study . `` High risk '' patient define either diagnosis and/or type surgical intervention list inclusion criterion . Neurological complication form new motor sensory deficit monitor prospectively patient hospital discharge , 6 week ( ± 2 week ) , 6 month ( ± 2 month ) 24 month ( ± 2 month ) surgery . The relationship surgical intervention assess new deficit . Regression analysis use evaluate association patient demographic , co-morbidities , treatment history , spinal deformity characteristic , surgical characteristic , non-neurologic complication pre-surgical status occurrence neurologic deficit surgery .

	<detailed_description>Although incidence complication patient undergo correction spinal deformity report extensively , majority study retrospective . There five study , three single institution , prospectively collect data specifically identify complication . The large series Buchowski et al report 108 patient fixed sagittal deformity undergo Pedicle Subtraction Osteotomy ( PSO ) 14 % over-all complication rate motor weakness 11 patient neurogenic bladder one patient , 3 permanent . Yang report 35 patient undergoing PSOs 46 % over-all complication rate one transient nerve root motor deficit . As 2002 report 83 patient undergo various osteotomy sagittal imbalance report 34 % over-all complication rate 3 permanent 3 transient nerve root deficit . Given lack information , need determine true incidence complication use prospective multi-center design . There need identify neurologic deficit systematic fashion include spinal cord , cauda equina nerve root deficit well radiculopathies . The risk factor associate occurrence complication , especially neurologic complication , also need fully elucidate . This increasingly relevant , new surgical technique allow aggressive correction spinal deformity may put spinal cord nerve root increase risk . Valid data incidence type neurologic deficit also need order study new drug available may mitigate risk . The primary objective study : ( ) establish incidence neurologic deficit `` high risk '' adult patient undergoing correction spinal deformity adult spinal deformity ( ii ) identify characteristic associate increase risk neurologic complication . Secondary objective include ( ) determine incidence complication related surgical correction `` high risk '' adult spinal deformity ; ( ii ) determine short-term clinical outcome patient undergo correction spinal deformity ( iii ) .to determine amount radiographic clinical correction deformity</detailed_description>
