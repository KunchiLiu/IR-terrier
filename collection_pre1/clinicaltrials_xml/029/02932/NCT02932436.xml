	<detailed_description>Diabetes serious increase global health burden . It show , diabetes associate two-fold high risk coronary heart disease , stroke aggregate vascular death independently conventional risk factor . It lead cause cardiovascular disease . Diabetes mellitus substantially increase risk macrovascular microvascular complication , vascular dysfunction develop coronary , cerebrovascular , peripheral arterial disease , heart failure , nerve disorder ( neuropathy ) , eye complication ( e.g . cataract , glaucoma diabetic retinopathy ) , kidney disease ( nephropathy ) , foot ulcer , restriction mental function , psychosomatic disease ( e.g . stress , anxiety depression ) . The common cardiovascular complication diabetic ischemic cardiomyopathy leave ventricular ( LV ) dysfunction . Of particular interest diastolic dysfunction , early sign diabetic heart muscle disease follow systolic damage . Although diabetes decisive role development cardiovascular disease , traditional glucose lower agent fail convincingly show intensive glucose control significantly reduce CVD event . A new approach treatment adult patient type 2 diabetes find selective inhibition sodium glucose cotransporter 2 ( SGLT2 ) . Studies show empagliflozin , potent SGLT2 inhibitor , effectively reduce rate hyperglycemia also blood pressure weight . ( 16 , 18 ) In addition , beneficial effect arterial stiffness vascular resistance , visceral adiposity , albuminuria plasma urate report . The result EMPA-REG OUTCOME study suggest empagliflozin added standard therapy positive influence cardiovascular outcome heart failure hospitalization individual diabetic mellitus . The aim present study investigate effect empagliflozin , comparison placebo , cardiac vascular function well cardiac biomarker individual type 2 diabetes standard therapy , increase E/E ' ratio poor glycemic control .</detailed_description>
