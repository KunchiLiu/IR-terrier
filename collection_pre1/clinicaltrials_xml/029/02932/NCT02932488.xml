	<brief_summary>The purpose study show PET-MR imaging use obtain pharmacodynamic profile drug . By use 5-HT1B receptor target also aim find effect area size 5-HT1B receptor agonist sumatriptan .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cerebral Pharmacodynamic Effects 5-HT1B Receptor Stimulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent technological advance multimodal image enable simultaneous acquisition magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) PET data . Whereas functional MRI ( fMRI ) provide excellent spatio-temporal resolution localizing change brain activity , PET offer high sensitivity neurochemical specificity . Together , PET MRI measure potential help clarify neurochemical basis change fMRI signal induced selective exogenous ligand endogenous neurotransmitter . In present study target 5-HT1B receptor selective radioligand exist ( 11C-AZ10419369 ) . The receptor stimulate agonist sumatriptan , use alleviate migraine attack . The mechanism action sumatriptan precisely know unknown degree sumatriptan cross blood-brain barrier exerts effect parenchyma . In study determine blood brain barrier penetration sumatriptan thereby evaluate Effect size , distribution signal change , correlation occupancy 5-HT1B receptor parenchyma ( measure change BPND ) hemodynamic response ( measure change CBF ) . Ahead main study pilot study conduct increase dos sumatriptan test subject obtain dose-response curve . At time side effect observe score . This serve find dose maximum effect size minimal side effect , use main study subject .</detailed_description>
