	<brief_summary>Alcohol use consider significant risk factor among die suicide , especially among drink regulate emotion . Unfortunately , dearth treatment outcome research suicidal heavy drinker . Further , treatment target population must maximally effective , promise wide dissemination . The application technology increasingly utilized efficacious acceptable way rapidly disseminate evidence-base treatment . However , method use infrequently individual deem high risk computerize treatment . Along line , goal project begin line research focus develop intervention reduce heavy drinking risk suicide use technology . Dialectical Behavior Therapy ( DBT ) skills train effective intervention behavior associate emotion dysregulation include addictive suicidal behavior . Further , DBT skills use identify active ingredient treatment effectiveness ; thus , skill train intervention deliver via Internet capacity potent efficient method treatment delivery . The goal research establish proof concept develop evaluate potentially efficacious acceptable intervention heavy episodic drinker suicidal . Specifically , project propose conduct randomize controlled pilot trial computerize DBT skill train intervention suicidal individual engage heavy episodic drinking ( HED ) regulate emotion . The project 's aim conduct randomize controlled pilot trial cDBT vs. Wait-list control ( WL ) . This pilot trial intend demonstrate cDBT work well intervention improve clinical index , rather determine whether revision cDBT intervention need inform design subsequent full-scale randomize controlled trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Computerized DBT Skills Training Suicidal Heavy Episodic Drinkers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It well establish clinical research focus streamline treatment way maximize potency ease implementation . The application technology increasingly utilized effective acceptable way rapidly disseminate evidence-base treatment . However , method use infrequently individual deem high risk computerize psychotherapy . This atheoretical approach participant exclusion broaden treatment gap among dire need treatment . Along line , primary goal project establish proof concept develop evaluate efficacious acceptable intervention heavy episodic drinker suicidal . This scope select increase feasibility pilot trial allow comparison wait-list control condition , provide important groundwork subsequent randomize control trial . The propose research take place one phase fall within Stage 1a 1b updated Stage Model Behavioral Therapy Research . This project consist randomize control pilot trial , initial `` strong test '' efficacy cDBT treatment HED suicidal behavior , use group design . This method intervention delivery ( e.g . computerization ) allow ease transition subsequent stage fit update scope Behavioral Therapy Research highlight need dissemination implementation . The overall aim project demonstrate cDBT work well intervention improve outcomes , rather provide preliminary evidence intervention feasible efficacious produce change deliver easily disseminate acceptable method . The primary goal computerize DBT Skills Training eliminate HED suicidal behavior function regulate emotion simultaneously increase behavioral control use functional , skillful behavior . cDBT-ER exist 8-week computerized skill intervention target difficulties emotion regulation include numerous skill explicitly target modify emotional state . DBT skills translate well computerized intervention , base learning model patient teach reproducible skill use environment . The propose intervention require add DBT addiction skill target heavy drinking well include computerize version risk assessment protocol ass suicidal urge electronically . The DBT addiction skill draw largely relapse prevention include DBT adaptation Harm Reduction ( via `` Dialectical Abstinence '' ) Urge Surfing ( via `` Burning Bridges ) . The addiction skill implement numerous DBT study explicitly target addictive behavior positive outcome reduce substance alcohol use . Thus , cDBT would teach client way reduce eliminate alcohol consumption , along skillful behavior effectively manage negative emotion .</detailed_description>
