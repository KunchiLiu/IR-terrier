The Intensive management PACT ( ImPACT ) intervention encompass number evidence-based strategy , include comprehensive intake process , coordination specialty care , chronic condition case management , provision social service , rapid response deterioration health , facilitation transition high-acuity event . The ImPACT program designate quality improvement ( non-research ) Palo Alto VA. A retrospective evaluation use deidentified data approve Stanford University IRB . Objectives : The objective evaluation ass ImPACT 's feasibility , implementation , effectiveness , lay groundwork future larger-scale effort evaluation within VA system . Methods : We partner implementation team VA Palo Alto 's ImPACT clinic conduct Hybrid Type 1 evaluation program 's feasibility , implementation , effectiveness . Specifically , evaluation aim : 1 . Evaluate feasibility implementation pilot ImPACT intervention . Using semi-structured interview ImPACT PACT team member leadership , evaluate success intervention delivery , include patient identification , recruitment , retention ; provision uptake plan service ; monitor patient participation key outcome . 2 . Evaluate ImPACT 's effect utilization cost care . We use difference-in-differences approach , wherein compare change VA health care cost ( total , well inpatient , outpatient , fee-basis ) utilization ( include hospitalization , emergency department visit , specialty care ) among ImPACT patient high-utilizing patient receive usual PACT care . 3 . Examine association ImPACT participation patient-centered outcome . Using data survey administer ImPACT clinic , assess patient satisfaction ImPACT intervention overall care , well change patient-reported outcome , include health status , symptom burden , function .</detailed_description>
