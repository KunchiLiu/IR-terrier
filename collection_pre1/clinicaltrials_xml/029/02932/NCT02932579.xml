	<brief_summary>Opioid analgesic common postoperative pain medication use among dentist United States.Although medication highly effective postoperative dental pain management , patient optimally benefit therapy . Many suffer adverse consequence nausea , emesis , psychomotor impairment , high prevalence opioid prescription misuse among substance abuser within dental patient population . The use non-opioid analgesic include ibuprofen acetaminophen management postoperative dental pain demonstrate equivalent superior analgesic effect compare opioid analgesic therapy , typically significantly less adverse effects.However , despite result , dentist encounter high variability success non-opioid analgesic response among postoperative dental pain population.Thus , new strategy earlier recognition analgesic response pain medication fundamental field dentistry . Therefore , study evaluate clinical utility pharmacogenomic test acute postoperative dental pain management among healthy adult undergo extraction impact mandibular third molar .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Utility Pharmacogenomic Testing Postoperative Dental Pain Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To date , use pharmacogenomic method medicine broaden understanding important role gene different phenotypes/genotypes make individual unique pain response , include drug biotransformation , transportation , drug-related side effect name few.Thus , recognize genetic profile individual prior prescription pain medication postoperative dental pain management essential provide effective safer pain therapy.Additionally , suggest 80 % individual general population exhibit genetic profile influence normal pain response non-opioid pain therapy . Hence postulate integration pharmacogenomic test guide prescription ibuprofen acetaminophen , , could lead improved clinical postoperative dental pain outcome , also , significantly reduce opioid analgesic prescription dentist .</detailed_description>
