	<brief_title>High-Flow Oxygen Dyspnea Hospitalized Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups Procedures : If agree take part study , receive 4 different breathe therapy : - High-flow oxygen - Low-flow oxygen - High-flow air - Low-flow air The order give randomly assign ( roll dice ) . You equal chance assign group . Neither study staff know therapy order assign . However , need safety , study staff able find receiving . All 4 breathing therapy take 80 minute total complete ( 10 minute treatment 10 minute break treatment ) . You receive air oxygen small tube place nose . The respiratory therapist adjust therapy comfort level . At end breathing therapy , ask shortness breath improvement . You also ask could tell whether received oxygen air therapy . After finish 4 breathing therapy , complete 2 questionnaire breathe therapy like thought take part study . These take 10 minute total complete . Length Study : You take study longer wish take part , need drug help shortness breath study . Your participation study complete questionnaire . This investigational study . Comparing high-flow air , low-flow air , high-flow oxygen , low-flow oxygen treat shortness breath consider investigational . Up 36 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
