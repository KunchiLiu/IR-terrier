	<brief_summary>Introduction : It well establish physical fitness improve muscle performance either sedentary people athlete . In regard , specific exercise respiratory muscle result good functional performance hospitalize individual , especially critically ill patient prolong wean . Objectives : To compare follow variable intervention control patient : success weaning , free time ventilator ICU weaning , gain muscle strength use inspiratory muscle training ( IMT ) . Patients method : Prospective randomized control clinical trial . Only individual prolong wean enrol . They undergo IMT manage conventional manner . The primary endpoint successful weaning . In addition , variable free time ventilator ICU wean muscle strength measure . In addition , mortality ICU , inside hospital discharge follow one year study entrance . Expected result : According work hypothesis , expect performance patient undergo IMT superior conventional treatment . Also , time mortality expect longer .</brief_summary>
