	<brief_summary>Transplantation cellularized human cornea impregnate populated mesenchymal stem cell derive patient 's adipose tissue . The purpose study assess safety , tolerability , preliminary efficacy transplantation single dose autologous mesenchymal adipose tissue derive adult stem cell ( ADAS ) cellularized laminas subject corneal defect . 3 group include study : ( 1 ) transplantation ADAS alone without scaffold , ( 2 ) transplantation scaffold ( human corneal decellularized lamina ) without ADAS , ( 3 ) transplantation ADAS cellularized scaffold ( human corneal decellularized lamina )</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Different type stem cell use various way several research project order find optimal procedure regenerate human corneal stroma . It include several approach classify intrastromal implantation stem cell ( 1 ) alone , ( 2 ) together biodegradable scaffold , ( 3 ) non-biodegradable scaffold , ( 4 ) decellularized corneal stromal scaffold . In fact , complex structure corneal stroma yet replicate , well know drawback use synthetic scaffold-based design . Recently , several corneal decellularization technique describe , provide acellular corneal extracellular matrix ( ECM ) . These scaffold gain attention last year provide natural environment growth differentiation cell compare synthetic scaffold . In addition , component ECM generally conserve among specie tolerate well even xenogeneic recipient . Keratocytes essential remodel corneal stroma normal epithelial physiology . This highlight importance transplant cellular substitute together structural support ( acellular ECM ) undertake critical function corneal homeostasis . To best investigator knowledge , attempt repopulate decellularized corneal scaffold use corneal cell , cell major drawback preclude autologous use clinical practice ( damage donor tissue , lack cell inefficient cell subculture ) , thus effort find extraocular source autologous cell . A recent study investigator show perfect biointegration human decellularized corneal stromal sheet ( 100µm thickness ) without h-ADASC colonization inside rabbit cornea vivo , without observe rejection response despite graft xenogeneic . The investigator also demonstrate differentiation h-ADASCs functional keratocytes inside implant vivo , achieve proper biofunctionalization . According investigator 's opinion transplant stem cell together decellularized corneal ECM would best technique effectively restore thickness diseased human cornea , like keratoconus . Through technique , use extraocular mesenchymal stem cell patient , possible transform allergenic graft functional autologous graft , theoretically avoid risk rejection . The process flow define follow : ( 1 ) file study : start receive file patient , file forward appoint physician coordinator review submission medical report , medical report evaluate within cell therapy committee patient ask clinical examination , consultation reply patient medical decision follow approval recruit yes , brief report procedure submit explain detail patient , consent form must sign patient agree include study , ( 2 ) patient admission : may start completion procedure form pre-op evaluation ( initial work define clinical biological assessment upon C.A.S may include unaided best spectacle correct visual acuity , refraction , slit lamp examination , intraocular pressure , fundoscopy , corneal topography , aberrometry , endothelial cell count ( specular microscopy ) well blood test ) ophthalmologist , follow lipoaspiration subcutaneous adipose tissue perform plastic surgeon , sample processing cGMP facility isolation characterization stromal vascular fraction enrich ADAS well laminas preparing ( quality control assessment realize step procedure start ADAS collection transplantation include cell culture , cell quiescence , decellularization human corneal lamina , recellularization lamina ADAS , transplantation ; assessment include cell viability , cell number , cell apoptosis , immunophenotyping , infection , inflammation analyze secrete cytokine ADAS , lamina cutting , lamina thickness , immunostaining , confocal microscopy , etc . ) ; ( 3 ) delivery ( transplantation ) start peribulbar retrobulbar anesthesia patient place operate microscope , follow femtosecond laser assist mid-stromal lamellar dissection , ADAS laminas recellularized lamina place within pocket , finally close superior incision closure . The patient putt antibiotic/steroids define period follow team 1 week , 2 week , 1 month , 3 month , 6 month 1 year . This protocol cell therapy apply exclusively Laser Vision ( Hazmieh-Lebanon ) prepare Reviva Regenerative Medicine Center affiliation VISSUM ( Alicante-Spain ) Optica General ( Saida-Lebanon ) . The patient 's recruitment take place : lipoaspiration , processing , prepare celluraized laminas quality control assessment , Middle East Institute Health Reviva Center ( Bsalim-Lebanon ) regulation hospital Reviva Center ; injection , Laser vision ( Hazmieh-Lebanon ) ; follow-up , Laser vision &amp; optica general . All step manage VISSUM ( Prof. J. ALIO ) .</detailed_description>
