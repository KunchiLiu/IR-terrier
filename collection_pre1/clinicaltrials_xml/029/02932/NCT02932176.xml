	<brief_summary>The use handheld arterial 'stethoscopes ' ( continuous wave Doppler device ) ubiquitous clinical practice . However , user receive formal training use interpretation return data . This lead delay diagnosis error diagnosis . The investigator intend create novel machine-learning algorithm assist clinician use data . This study allow investigator collect sound file use device compare algorithms output establish , exist vascular testing . There invasive procedure , use stethoscope part routine clinical care . If successful , data algorithm later deploy via smartphone app point case test separate study</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There three main research task project : 1 ) identification discriminant feature Doppler audio patient classification , 2 ) selection train classification algorithm , 3 ) CWD audio data enrichment use physics-based model . The investigator determine discriminant feature optimal patient classification ultrasound Doppler audio . To end , investigator employ signal feature frequency domain bandwidth , peak frequency , mean power , mean frequency , time harmonic distortion , among others . Furthermore , investigator investigate whether time domain feature necessary accurate sound classification . Other study show specific feature audio waveform classify data . The investigator employ effective machine-learning algorithm classification SVM , logistic regression , Na√Øve Bayes , among others . The investigator start binary classification problem individual classify healthy unhealthy . Then , investigator move complexity multi-class classification problem individual categorize different group accord define abnormal arterial condition . Data enrichment use physics-based model employ physiologically accurate finite element model fluid flow artery generate synthetic sound signal correspond various arterial condition . Physics-based simulation would allow investigator produce wealth training data span many know arterial condition . This capability augment classification accuracy generalization algorithm , clinical data may exhaustive enough incorporate know arterial condition . The investigator study performance train algorithms patient data . To end , investigator partition data train test sample . The training sample use training algorithm , test set use assess generalization capability . The investigator compute misclassification rate algorithm metric performance .</detailed_description>
