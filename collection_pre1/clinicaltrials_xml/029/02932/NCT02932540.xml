	<brief_summary>Cerebral autoregulation important mechanism whereby cerebral perfusion normally maintain constant level , relatively wide blood pressure range . It assess noninvasively use Trans Cranial Doppler ( TCD ) . This mean use ultrasound probe side head measure change blood flow one main brain artery ( middle cerebral artery ) response beat beat change blood pressure dynamic cerebral autoregulation ( dCA ) . It establish dCA impaired follow moderate severe stroke , act key role development secondary brain damage relate brain swell damage relate low blood flow . The administration clot bust therapy ( thrombolysis ) , one main approve treatment acute ischaemic stroke ( AIS ) , result recanalisation block artery approximately 50 % patient . Therefore , well attempt treat major vessel blockage , improve brain blood flow , particularly penumbral area , artery bypass blockage another potential therapeutic approach AIS.One simple way achieve might lower head AIS patient lie flat ( 0⁰ ) position . However , date , study explore . This research use noninvasive technique Trans Cranial Doppler ( TCD ) see blood flow change different head position , healthy volunteer AIS patient . This study provide important data regard blood pressure management acute stroke , important common clinical dilemma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In United Kingdom ( UK ) alone , approximate 100,000 people suffer stroke year . Improved management stroke patient reduce morbidity mortality , also reduce cost long term social care . The brain control system ( i.e.cerebral autoregulation ) maintain blood flow brain , relatively wide blood pressure range . Cerebral Autoregulation describe static , reflect integrity mechanisms time , dynamic , occur response sudden fluctuation perfusion pressure . When blood pressure drop , small artery increase size restore flow level , blood pressure rise , narrow protect delicate blood vessel . It known sudden decompensated blood pressure ( BP ) change occur stroke , could result brain bleeding swell uncontrolled increase blood flow , reduce viability tissue surround stroke area reduce blood flow brain . It known clot bust agent ( Alteplase ) , main effective treatment use acute stroke improve blood flow already block artery 50 % patient . Therefore , well attempt treat blockage major vessel , improve blood flow vessel bypass block vessel around stroke area ( penumbra ) could another potential therapeutic approach acute ischaemic stroke patient . A simple way increase blood flow penumbral area might lower head acute stroke patient lie flat position . Several observational study investigate effect head position blood flow brain healthy population , however study carry acute ischaemic stroke patient far . Cerebral autoregulation assess non-invasively use Trans Cranial Doppler ( TCD ) . This mean use ultrasound probe side head measure change blood flow one main brain artery ( middle cerebral artery ) response beat beat change blood pressure dynamic cerebral autoregulation . This research use noninvasive technique Trans Cranial Doppler see blood flow change different head position acute ischaemic stroke patient healthy control , well time recovery stroke . This knowledge help u understand change brain blood flow control blood pressure stroke patient , implication diagnosis , prognosis , treatment disease .</detailed_description>
