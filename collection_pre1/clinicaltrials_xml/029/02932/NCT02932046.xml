	<brief_summary>Anorexia mean loss appetite . But disagreement whether appetite change disease anorexia nervosa ( AN ) . Appetite subjective essential sense , regulate complex ensemble brain , stomach - intestinal system hormone . As direct result malnutrition , many somatic complication cause disease AN . Several complication may affect hunger- satiety perception . An example delay gastric emptying . Furthermore , change hormone system affect biological `` reward system '' brain , play important role appetite regulation . There clearly need research could lead good treatment AN . Hunger- satiety perception study small cross-sectional study clear conclusion . The purpose study determine whether visual analog scale measurement detect change hunger- satiety perception least 30 patient admitted nutrition life-threatening severe anorexia nervosa . It may lead first step development simple inexpensive instrument may prove useful measure impact new ongoing treatment disease .</brief_summary>

Hunger satiety subjective sensation may influence sensory factor palatability , include taste , smell texture . A recent study suggest patient AN may alter perception olfactory , gustatory stimulus , reduce perception bitter stimulus . Other physiological factor , hypothalamic mesolimbic endocannabinoids , enhance appetite stimulate neurochemical pathway underlie homeostatic rewarding aspect food intake . Endocannabinoids involve food-related reward mechanism , increase evidence mechanism dysregulated AN patient .
