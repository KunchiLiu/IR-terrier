	<brief_summary>Cesarean scar diverticulum ( CSD ) novel recognize cause postmenstrual abnormal uterine bleed woman . No clinical guideline issue management CSD . The investigator previously demonstrate vaginal repair CSD relative effective treatment CSD . However , 28.2 % CSD patient normalize less 7 day menstruation , whereas 51.2 % woman 7 10 day menstruation 6 month post vaginal repair . Postoperative menstruation may contribute surgical site infection , may subsequently affect heal uterine scar . Treatment CSD patient gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist ( GnRHa ) may potential improve therapeutic effect vaginal repair . Therefore , current multiple-center randomize controlled trial design evaluate whether application GnRHa combination vaginal repair could achieve good clinical effect achieve vaginal CSD repair alone .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Postoperative menstruation may contribute surgical site infection , inflammatory environment , congestion site suture , immune cell infiltration , effect may subsequently affect heal uterine scar . It reasonable hypothesize delay postoperative menstrual recovery period may allow uterine scar heal without inflammatory reaction cause menstruation . Treatment gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist ( GnRHa ) ability suppress follicle-stimulating hormone ( FSH ) luteinizing hormone ( LH ) release , thereby maintain low estrogen level cause temporary amenorrhea . A prolonged menstrual recovery period may achieve GnRHa administration . Vaginal repair CSD combine GnRHa may improve therapeutic effect treatment CSD . Therefore , randomize study design evaluate whether application GnRHa combination vaginal repair could achieve good clinical effect achieve vaginal CSD repair alone .</detailed_description>
