	<brief_summary>It estimate worldwide , 15 million people affect vascular accident ( CVA ) per year , Brazil , stroke major cause death disability , generate much economic social impact generate motor sequela , sensory cognitive arising blockage rupture blood vessel . Among motor sequela hemiparesis , affect 80 % case consequent impairment quality life individual . However , physical therapy show facilitate return function individual , minimize sensorimotor deficit promote neuronal plasticity motor relearn . Among feature physical therapy conventional physical therapy technique , Therapy Restriction Movement Induction ( TRIM ) Mental Practice . In view , objective study compare application conventional physiotherapy protocol TRIM / mental practice morphometric feature , functionality quality life post-stroke hemiparetic subject chronic phase . 60 volunteer select , sex , age 45 80 year clinical diagnosis stroke , hemiparesis chronic phase divide four group ( N = 15 ) : control group ( CG ) , TRIM Group ( GT ) , Mental Practice group ( GPM ) group TRIM + Mental Practice ( GTPM ) perform specific exercise group three time week , total 24 session . Volunteers evaluate four time Fugl-Meyer Assessment scale ( FMA ) adapt Motor Ability Test Upper Limb ( THMMS ) ass Quality Life use Quality Scale Specific Life Vascular Accident brainstem ( EQVE-AVE ) oxidative stress analysis collect blood electromyography muscular activity . After research data tabulate Excel spreadsheet perform intergroup intragroup comparison four evaluation time , use data analysis BioEstat® 5.2 program , choice test analysis dependent statistical distribution type find homogeneity variance .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The sample compose 60 volunteer sex , clinical diagnosis stroke ( CVA ) injury six month time characterize chronic stage disease present hemiparesis upper limb . PROCEDURES AND DATA COLLECTION The research divide follow step : STAGE 1 : The search begin invitation volunteer participate study , poster verbal invitation . Then , pre-selection candidate apply MMSE perform , Jaeger card Whisper test order evaluate existence cognitive impairment , visual auditory respectively . If make sample , volunteer select meet inclusion exclusion criterion , researcher deliver two-way IC explain occur research objective Office application Protocol deliver two-way also statement photographs footage authorization display permit photos footage . It noteworthy route term Declaration sign every page volunteer , copy document . Prior procedure data collection , researcher train application instrument evaluation handle resource use treatment volunteer . 2nd STAGE : Volunteers evaluate scale application FMA THMMS order analyze functionality ability MS QOL assess EQVE-stroke described material methodology . The amplitude paretic upper limb movement also assess goniometry scapulohumeral humeral joint , shoulder , elbow , wrist , thumb interphalangeal use universal manual goniometer another small toward measure finger . The first measure goniometric obtain patient 's arrival treatment- place pre-treatment . The following measure treatment ( 12 ° session ) immediate late stage treatment . To perform procedure ask volunteer remain supine stretcher , follow sit position chair , latter position upper limb align trunk forearm evaluate small table , neutral pronation supination elbow hold 90 ° flexion . 3rd STAGE : Next muscle electromyographic activity measure electromyography apparatus Miotec ® . Volunteers conduct test well-lit room adequate ventilation environment without noise , place sit position arm support fixed surface surface electrode connect paretic upper limb guidance position electrode muscular motor point previously locate electrical stimulator couple conductive gel , promote stable transition tendon insertion order quantitatively analyze information send nerve member . The investigator ask volunteer perform three isometric contraction four second two interval contraction two minute , ask contraction patient reach maximum strength . The muscle analyze flexor finger flexor wrist flexor ulnar elbow flexor , shoulder flexor internal rotators shoulder , answer measure displayed computer screen BIOPAC ® system . 4th STAGE : As functional range MS paretic measure functional reach test , adapt sit position , individual sit without armrest chair upper limb , position laterally wall , shoulder 15 cm away without touch time , foot parallel comfortable position , keep shoulder near wall flex 90 ° . A tape measure fix parallel floor , position height acromion . The volunteer instruct lean forward much possible ; displacement measure tape three attempt functional range , obtain average three . 5th STEP : Then , collection handgrip strength paretic MS use hydraulic dynamometer handgrip Jamar® volunteer sit position bed , stand shoulder neutral position , elbow wrist 90 ° neutral position , therapist support dynamometer . Volunteers instruct perform three handgrip maneuver reach maximum voluntary contraction hand , one-minute interval one operation another . After collection simple arithmetic average entree three measure collect . These procedure study take place four stage : start treatment correspond pre-treatment ; 12th session correspond intermediate treatment ; immediately 24th session , correspond immediate post-treatment ; total intervention time equal 24 session , distribute three weekly session hold alternate day ( Monday , Wednesday Friday ) . After evaluate functionality evaluation oxidative stress . Initially collect blood sterile needle lance medial side digital pulp fourth finger leave hand , pre-cleaned 70 % alcohol . The collection blood drop make razor five light tap blade drop microscopy . After , room temperature ( 23 ° C ) , blade keep place protect contact blood nine minute realization collect blood clot process . At end period , morphology clot microscopically observe 40X magnification . Morphological evaluation oxidative stress plasm blood evaluate accord test know Optical Microscopy cell analysis vitro HLB test , also know designation Dry layer oxidative test , refer microscopic morphology oxidative stress plasm ( EEW ) . The EEW provide indirect information oxidative stress , among others , use follow grade system percentage discontinuous area clot present microscope slide : grade I ( normal oxidative stress rate , total area discontinuous extracellular matrix ( ME ) less 10 % ) , grade II ( mild stress , ME discontinuity area 10 20 % ) , grade III ( moderate stress ME discontinuity area 20 30 % ) , grade IV ( severe stress , ME discontinuity area 30 40 % ) grade V ( severe stress , ME discontinuity area 40 % ) . The respective assigned qualitative graduation log spreadsheet analysis statistic . As measure standardization , observation morphological pattern different clot perform one researcher associate assessment OxyScanner so-called program develop marketed Aldea Global Soluciones® ( SFA ) , give copy software . This evaluation do four stage , use throughout process coat , disposable glove mask , hold one researcher , order avoid bias research .</detailed_description>
