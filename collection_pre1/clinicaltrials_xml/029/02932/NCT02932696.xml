	<brief_summary>The main goal project study describe effect exercise training systolic diastolic myocardial function assess 2D ultrasound strain myocardial infarction . Our work hypothesis intrinsic myocardial contractility relaxation assess global longitudinal strain phase II ( 2D strain ) post-infarction exercise training improve compare baseline value well compare value no-training group . Should hypothesis prove true , would help explain improvement functional capacity observe post-infarction period exercise training .</brief_summary>
