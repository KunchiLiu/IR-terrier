	<brief_title>Randomized , Double Blind , Parallel Group , Placebo Controlled , Multi-Center Study Efficacy Safety Cetirizine HCl Syrup vs. Loratadine Syrup v . Placebo Treatment Children With Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis ( SAR )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-center , randomize , double-blind , parallel-group , placebo-controlled , double dummy study child SAR conduct Spring tree grass allergy season . Subjects qualified randomization diary card include ( 1 ) symptom score ≥2 least 2 follow 4 rhinoconjunctivitis symptom 4 day : sneezing , runny nose , itchy eye , watery eye ; ( 2 ) total rhinoconjunctivitis ( Total Symptom Severity Complex [ TSSC ] ) score ≥5 4 day . The TSSC score express sum 4 individual symptom score record daily diary card follow symptom : sneezing , runny nose , itchy eye , watery eye . Subjects randomize receive 1 3 treatment double-blind fashion use 1:1:1 allocation ratio : cetirizine HCl syrup placebo loratadine syrup ; loratadine syrup placebo cetirizine HCl syrup ; cetirizine placebo syrup loratadine placebo syrup . Number Subjects ( Planned Analyzed ) : 1100 plan ; 1536 screen ; 683 randomize : 231 ( 33.8 % ) randomize cetirizine HCl treatment group , 221 ( 32.4 % ) loratadine treatment group , 231 ( 33.8 % ) placebo treatment group . Test Product Reference Therapy : Subjects randomize receive cetirizine HCl syrup also receive placebo syrup ; subject randomize receive loratadine syrup also receive placebo syrup ; placebo syrup receive subject randomize receive placebo . Duration Double-Blind Treatment : 2 week . Safety measure include incidence severity treatment-emergent adverse event ( AEs ) , vital sign , concomitant medication , physical examination finding . Clinical laboratory evaluation require study . Statistical Methods : All statistical test related treatment effect 2-sided , statistical significance declare 0.05 probability level . Least square mean ( LSMeans ) use estimate treatment effect . Populations analyze include Full Analysis ( intent-to-treat [ ITT ] ) Set ( FAS ) , Per-Protocol Set ( PPS ) , Safety-Analyzable Set , All-Screened Analysis Set . Demographic baseline data subject Safety-Analyzable Set summarize list . The effect treatment Overall analysis Time Points assess use ANCOVA model . The main effect model contain term treatment Investigator site , baseline TSSC value covariate . The LSMeans standard error base main effect model . Methods analysis secondary efficacy data include analysis covariance ( ANCOVA ) model Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel ( CMH ) row mean score test . Analysis drug safety include incidence treatment-emergent AEs ( TEAE ) , concomitant medication , vital sign , physical examination finding Safety-Analyzable Set .</detailed_description>
