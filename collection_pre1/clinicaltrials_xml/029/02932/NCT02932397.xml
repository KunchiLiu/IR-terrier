	<brief_summary>Emergence general anesthesia critical period , way induction anesthesia , several adverse event may occur . Extubation may even difficult intubation , high respiratory complication rate . Among , cough common expect . It associate significant complication include hypertension , tachycardia , increase intracranial pressure , bleed surgical site even wind dehiscence . The incidence cough emergence general anesthesia varies depend type airway instrumentation , population study , agent use maintenance anesthesia technique use prevent cough . In literature , incidence cough emergence general anesthesia endotracheal intubation vary 38 96 % . In center , incidence cough emergence general anesthesia desflurane endotracheal intubation 30 % accord local preliminary study . Propofol well-known inhibit airway reflex . Total intravenous anesthesia ( TIVA ) associate low incidence coughing compare inhalated anesthesia . The efficacy propofol subhypnotic dose reduce cough emergence recently demonstrate patient undergo nasal surgery sevoflurane . However , effective antitussive dose remain unknown efficacy anesthesia desflurane yet demonstrate . Propofol rapidly available , simple administer interest pharmacological profile , among others due short half-life . The aim study evaluate intravenous bolus 0.5 mg/kg propofol effective placebo administration decrease incidence cough emergence general anesthesia desflurane ( PROPOREV ) . Propofol could also reduce incidence postoperative nausea vomiting ( PONV ) .</brief_summary>
