	<detailed_description>Epilepsy disease characterize tendency seizure , think due excessive activity neuron brain . However , technically difficult record activity neuron , especially brain human patient . Therefore , gaps scientist know exactly go wrong neuron epileptic seizure . In study , array micro-electrodes insert brain patient epilepsy undergo clinically indicate assessment intracranial electroencephalography ( EEG ) . The micro-electrode array able continuously record activity neuron human brain . In combination standard intracranial EEG , record micro-electrode array allow good understand relationship epileptic seizure activity neuron .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient 18 year old old Patient suffers potentially surgically remediable drugresistant focal epilepsy Patient neocortical resective surgery deem likely Patient require evaluation intracranial subdural EEG electrode Patient cortical area eloquent ( i.e . involve critical neurological function like language motor control ) deem highly likely involved seizure onset propagation therefore appropriate site implantation microelectrode array Patient able willing provide inform consent Patient neocortical resective surgery deem unlikely ( e.g . patient corpus callosotomy another palliative epilepsy surgery procedure plan ) Patient investigate stereoEEG electrode ( patient undergo craniotomy clinical purpose , implantation microelectrode array therefore impossible ) Patient whose epileptic seizure cause hypermotor violent motor behavior ( due risk MD mechanical failure related injury ) Patient previous history bacterial meningitis ( due risk thicken arachnoid membrane complicate implantation microelectrode array ) Patient severe psychiatric disease psychological distress Patient severe concomitant medical disease ( include , limited , cardiovascular disease , respiratory illness , renal failure , hepatic dysfunction , etc . ) Patient know compromise immune system cause medical condition chronic consumption immunosuppressant medication ( due increase risk infection ; include diabetes mellitus ) Patient colonization methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus ( due increase risk difficulttomanage infection ) Patient know tendency increase bleeding ( due increase risk hemorrhage ) Patient implant intracranial stimulator , vagus nerve stimulator , cochlear implant remain active study ( due potential interference microelectrode recording ) Women pregnant breastfeeding study</criteria>
