	<brief_summary>The Irritable Bowel Syndrome ( IBS ) define combination abdominal pain , bowel dysfunction recurrent period shorter long duration . The absence well-defined pathophysiological marker require clinical definition . The used Rome criterion III whose version publish 2006 version IV development . An epidemiological study conduct 2003 Europe 8 country 42 000 people , find basis questionnaire prevalence 11.5 % diagnosis IBS 4.8 % .in total population ; result study comparable data obtain USA . A French work team 35 447 healthy adult find 6.2 % frequency . In study , large predominance woman ( sex ratio near 2 ) , preponderance subject age group 40-50 year . IBS economic weight high , partly due cost directly incur IBS cost generate associated disease : number visit general practitioner , specialist , prescription realization complementary examination , hospitalization , purchase drug work stoppage . From pathophysiologic perspective , IBS consider multifactorial disease involve vary degree , depend individual variable , visceral hypersensitivity , disturbance digestive motility , impaired sensorimotor way communication gastrointestinal tract central nervous system , intestinal micro-inflammation .

	<detailed_description>The Irritable Bowel Syndrome ( IBS ) define association abdominal pain , bowel dysfunction longer short period time , case , recur . The absence well-defined pathophysiological marker , require clinical definition . The used Rome criterion III whose version publish 2006 , Version IV development . coordinator 's team demonstrate randomized , placebo-controlled , 31 patient refractory IBS , visceral osteopathy associate significant improvement diarrhea , abdominal distension abdominal pain without change constipation . This improvement associate decrease rectal sensitivity without change depression , time total segmental colonic transit . This effect persist one year end essay . Primary objective To evaluate efficacy osteopathic manipulative treatment IBS symptom IBS adult patient 3-sessions period accord preliminary study ( 73 ) . Secondary objective To evaluate compare result two therapeutic modality : osteopathic manipulative treatment placebo manipulative treatment - Subjective clinical criterion : Constipation , Diarrhea , abdominal pain , bloating , topology abdominal pain . - Improvement quality life - Decrease depression anxiety - Changes medication treatment - Search possible practitioner effect . Experimental design : Double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled study , parallel group multicenter French study 3 OMT session follow 18-week follow-up period . Patients randomize 1:1 ratio receive osteopathic manipulative treatment placebo manipulative treatment every 2 week stratification accord IBS phenotype ( IBS-C , IBS-D , IBS-M , IBS-U ) . Description research methodology Design Double blind randomized clinical trial distribution subject group ratio ( 1:1 ) It double blind , multicenter , comparative , prospective , two-arms randomize study . - One group patient benefit OMT treatment irritable bowel syndrome . - One group patient receive placebo manipulation therapy treatment irritable bowel syndrome Schedule The schedule include 7 visit : - Four medical visit : V0 ( inclusion ) , V4 ( week 8 ) , V5 week 12 V6 week 24 respectively ; - Three osteopathic visit ( V1 , V2 , V3 ) correspond visceral placebo manipulative treatment week 2 , 4 , 6 , respectively . - If patient , able immediately participate study screen visit ( VS ) could add order separate decision participation begin study . Efficacy assessment The main criterion treatment efficacy value IBS severity score . The IBS severity score establish self-administered questionnaire develop validated Francis . The French version validate MAPI Research Institute . This questionnaire include two item concern abdominal pain abdominal bloating ( yes/no ) four visual analog scale ( 1-100 ) ass severity abdominal pain , bloating , relief stool , impact symptom quality life . The number day patient suffer last 10 day also record . The response use calculate quantitative severity score 0 500 use make qualitative classification : severity score 75-175 = mild , 175-300 = moderate , &gt; 300 = severe . This questionnaire register 7 time , inclusion ( V0 ) , osteopathic visit ( V1 , V2 , V3 ) medical visit ( V4 , V5 , V6 ) : - Before treatment ( V0 ) , - During visceral manipulative treatment ( V1 , V2 , V3 ) - During follow-up period , visceral manipulative treatment ( osteopathic placebo ) , - At 8 week ( V4 ) inclusion , - At 12 week ( V5 ) inclusion - At 24 week ( V6 ) end follow visit In center , local osteopath learn provide placebo osteopathic manipulation Number subject choose : 210 patient Sample Size Considering minimal clinical difference primary outcome measure would lead clinician change treatment 50 point IBS Symptom Severity Score , standard deviation variable 105 point , sample size require detect difference 90 % power 5 % two-sided significance level 94 patients/group . To allow loss follow around 10 % , total sample size trial would N=210 patient . Number centre 7 centre include . Research period - Inclusion period : 24 month - Treatment period : 6 week - Follow period : 18 week Total research period : 30 month . Statistical analysis Descriptive Statistics All study variable present treatment overall , use appropriate descriptive statistic accord variable nature , unless otherwise specify : - Continuous variable : number non-missing observation , mean , standard deviation , standard error mean , minimum , median , maximum . - Categorical variable : number non-missing observation column percentage ( N , % ) category . Primary efficacy endpoint Primary endpoint : Changes baseline IBSSS V4 , analyze mixed model ANCOVA patient random factor . Baseline value score well variable priori know affect score include model . Secondary efficacy endpoint - Secondary efficacy variable binary outcome ( i.e . responder status ) analyse use Chi-square Fisher 's exact test 2 x 2 contingency table compare active treatment group placebo . A two-sided overall significance level 5 % use . - Secondary efficacy variable continuous variable ( i.e . `` change baseline '' ) evaluate analysis covariance ( ANCOVA ) model fix effect term treatment group patient 's correspond baseline value parameter covariate . The rebound effect evaluate pairwise t-test . - Exploratory efficacy endpoint safety endpoint analyse descriptive statistic . For efficacy endpoint , follow subgroup-analyses present : - Age ( &lt; 65 year vs. ≥65 year ) . - Baseline abdominal pain severity ( pain intensity 11-point NRS ) &lt; 5 , ≥5 &lt; 8 , ≥8 ) . - Baseline IBS-SSS score ( mild IBS : &lt; 175 score point , moderate IBS : 175 &lt; 300 score point , severe IBS : ≥300 score point ) . - BMI ( &lt; 30 kg/m² vs. BMI ≥30 kg/m² ) . - Osteopath effect : analysis data accord osteopath practice manipulative treatment . - Analysis accord subtype IBS ( IBS constipation , IBS diarrhoea , Mixed IBS , Unspecified IBS ) .</detailed_description>
