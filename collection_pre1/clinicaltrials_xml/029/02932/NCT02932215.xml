	<detailed_description>Design Overview : This 10 week , open-label , prospective study , involve 10 volunteer participant cannabis use disorder test feasibility safety use lorcaserin addition feasibility , likability , utility mobile sensor device cannabis user . The study entirely outpatient Upon study entry , participant begin clinic visit Substance Treatment Research Service ( STARS ) clinic . All consent participant receive Fitbit charge HR mobile device week 1 wear entire study receive lorcaserin begin week 2 total 8 week ( week 2-9 ) . At begin week 10 follow discontinuation lorcaserin , participant continue wear device final week follow completion medication trial . All participant visit clinic twice weekly provide urine toxicology THC , report adverse event , complete additional assessment ( outline ) , upload de-identified data device secure encrypt database . Study assessment collect baseline , throughout study , 1 week follow medication discontinuation . All participant also receive medical management , medication adherence focus psychosocial intervention facilitates compliance study medication study procedure , include adherence wearing device , promote abstinence cannabis substance . Progressive voucher incentive provide compliance visit attendance study procedure . The specific aim project : 1 . To determine whether lorcaserin associate reduction baseline cannabis use individual cannabis use disorder seek treatment . 2 . To determine tolerability lorcaserin population . 3 . To evaluate feasibility likability incorporate mobile health sensor device treatment study cannabis use disorder . The primary outcome measure : 1 . Lorcaserin significantly reduce cannabis use study period measure self-report ( Timeline Followback ) creatinine-normalized quantitative THC urine level . 2 . Lorcaserin well tolerate participant cannabis use disorder measure proportion participant complete study , adherence medication , proportion participant experience adverse event . 3 . Participants find feasible likeable utilize Fitbit Charge HRTM study measure selfreport assessment like adherence wear device Secondary aim include : 1 . To evaluate effect medication treatment cannabis use disorder activity , sleep , stress , quality life measure mobile sensor device self-report assessment individual cannabis use disorder . 2 . To evaluate correlation summarize Fitbit Charge HR health sensor measure self-report assessment sleep , stress , quality life addition participant ' use cannabis cannabis withdrawal baseline , , treatment trial . The secondary outcome measure include : 1 . Medication treatment increase positive health behavior include activity improve sleep ( increase total sleep time percentage deep sleep ) addition decrease stress improve quality life measure summarized daily total step , sleep duration quality , summarize stress score measure device conjunction improvement Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory ( PSQI ) , decrease Perceived Stress Scale score ( PSS ) , improvement Quality Life , Enjoyment , Satisfaction Questionnaire ( QLESQ ) , compare baseline . Negative health behavior ( poor sleep , decreased activity , increase stress ) high within subject start treatment initial abstinence cannabis withdrawal symptom prominent . Positive health behavior increase treatment within subject , particularly towards second half treatment reduction cannabis use abstinence sustain . 2 . The device measure self-report measure directly correlate , expect ; ie : increased sleep increase % deep sleep correlate high PSQI score . When participant use baseline level cannabis cannabis withdrawal , device measure consistent negative health behavior ( poor sleep , decreased activity , increase stress ) . When reduce cannabis use achieve abstinence sustain period ( 14 day ) , association positive health behavior measure mobile device ( adequate sleep , adequate activity , decrease stress ) increase . The objective pilot obtain preliminary data cannabis use pattern , tolerability medication , sleep , quality life activity pattern individual cannabis use disorder conduct large trial lorcaserin inform future application mobile sensor cannabis use disorder treatment .</detailed_description>
