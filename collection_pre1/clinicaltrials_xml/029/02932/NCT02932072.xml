	<brief_summary>Microscopy remain key indicator drug efficacy test perform context clinical trial monitor exist antimalarial context regulatory clinical trial registration new drug . It one main diagnostic method malaria diagnosis general , ideal set provide low-cost accurate diagnosis , determine density parasites blood , accurately differentiate different malaria parasite specie , characteristic vital implementation global plan drug efficacy monitoring . Malaria rapid test ( RDTs ) , useful case management , provide information parasite density specie differentiation necessary research drug efficacy assessment . Microscopy therefore retain key advantage number new technology , reliability severely impede dependence high technical competence human operator well availability high quality equipment reagent . Recent study demonstrate frequent poor specificity sensitivity associate manual microscopy diagnostics operational condition , , . Advances digital microscopy performance affordability open door potentially significant improvement performance malaria diagnostic microscopy , overcome serious deficiency current drug efficacy assessment , broadly malaria diagnosis management . Intellectual Ventures Laboratory ( IVL ) , collaboration Global Good Fund ( GG ) , develop initial microscope prototype support research dark field image unstained malaria slide . The system consist low cost electromechanical component scan standard slide , optical train high numerical aperture objective , image capture system . Captured image analyze custom image analysis software develop GG/IVL , use algorithm design automatic malaria diagnosis , without user input . Additionally , image processing algorithm build around detection Giemsa-stained malaria slide current standard malaria microscopy . Initial result show excellent potential sensitivity specificity exceed typical manual microscopist field . Based positive market need assessment January , 2013 , give stakeholder malaria diagnostics community , GG/IVL pursue improvement integration algorithm portable microscope platform characteristic similar prototype microscope already develop GG/IVL dark field imaging . The prototype Autoscope first test field setting Thailand Nov 2014 - Jan 2015 clinic operate Shoklo Malaria Research Unit ( SMRU ) . The goal first field evaluation ass Autoscope respect diagnostic performance also suitability harsh condition typically encounter field clinic . Further , user feedback design functionality seek . The Autoscope accompany image analysis algorithm since develop new version available testing .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Field Evaluation Device Automated Malaria Microscopy ( Autoscope Version 2 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design &amp; Procedure The primary purpose evaluation quantify diagnostic performance Autoscope version 2 prototype field set . The performance Autoscope version 2 prototype assess scan negative positive slide Autoscope version 2 comparing result expert microscopy . Plasmodium genus- species-specific PCR also perform additional confirmatory test detection malaria parasites specie present . Testing microscopy Autoscope perform field clinic setting Giemsa-stained stain slide prepared febrile patient blood collect finger-prick . Patient recruitment aim recruit 80 slide-confirmed malaria case ( P. falciparum , P. vivax specie ) per country ( i.e. , total 160 case ) include study . Patient procedures Patients present clinic screen assess eligibility . A consent form local language ( Karen Burmese SMRU sit , Bahasa South Sumatera EOCRU site ) administer patient description intention study order protect human subject study specific procedure conduct . It clearly state participation voluntary subject guardian free discontinue participation withdraw consent participate time reason without prejudice future care , obligation give reason discontinuation withdrawal . The subject guardian allow much time need consider information opportunity question authorize research member , independent party decide whether ( allow his/her charge ) participate study . Written inform consent obtain mean subject guardian date signature thumb print ( unable write ) , sign dated signature witness date signature person present obtain informed consent . All individual write informed consent form store securely . Children capable understanding study ( approximately 7 year age SMRU sit 12 year age EOCRU sit ) ask sign assent form . A copy sign informed consent document ( ) give participant . Once informed consent obtain , subject number assign record screen enrollment log . A drops blood ( maximum 150-200 µL ) obtain finger-prick study-specific laboratory procedure describe perform . The patient receive clinical care appropriate accord routine procedure . Laboratory procedure All laboratory procedure perform accord applicable standard operating procedure . At clinic ( Wang Pha , Mawker Tai , Thailand Hanura , South Sumatera , Indonesia ) - Blood collection finger-prick ( maximum 150-200 µL ) , use prepare slide . - Perform malaria RDT ( part routine practice malaria detection ) , prepare 2 slide thick thin blood film , store remainder blood sample PCR detect determine specie malaria parasites - Microscopy Giemsa-stained blood film ( microscopist remain blinded RDT Autoscope result ) , record result - Run Autoscope detection , record result , store image capture device At SMRU EOCRU - Review slide expert microscopist ( microscopist remain blinded RDT Autoscope result ) - PCR detect determine specie malaria parasite At WWARN Laboratory , Bangkok - Review field data identify discrepant reading tie-breaker reading case discordance result obtain site re-checking slide Quality Assurance - Quality control perform WWARN expert microscopists 20 % randomly select slide 25 positive 25 negative slide per country , whichever great</detailed_description>
