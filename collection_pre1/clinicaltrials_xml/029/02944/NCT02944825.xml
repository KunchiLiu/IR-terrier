	<detailed_description>This study single-institutional randomize , single-blinded prospectively control clinical trial single dose Ciprofloxicin 500mg antibiotic tablet prophylaxis time office flexible cystoscopy ureteral stent removal . The control group prophylaxis oral antibiotic . The study conduct UCSD Urology outpatient clinic Genesis Healthcare Partners Urology outpatient clinic . UCSD coordinate institution . Treatment Assignment : Patients assign control intervention arm base predetermined allocation sequence generate computerized random number generator . Study staff participate patient recruitment procedure manage allocation sequence . Physicians involved urologic patient care blind participant ' allocation . Only study staff coordinate institution ( UCSD ) access full allocation sequence . i.e . clinical staff involve recruit consent patient study UCSD participate institution knowledge allocation sequence institution prior enrollment patient . To aid allocation concealment , block size vary . Standard care procedure : Patients identified time clinic visit cystoscopic stent removal . All patient counsel American Urological Association 's clinical guideline prophylactic antibiotic use , varied standardization practice pattern . We deviate routine care standard . Patients undergo routine ureteral stent removal within two week follow stone treatment procedure ( ie . Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy , Ureteroscopy , Retrograde Intrarenal Surgery , Extracorporal Shockwave Lithotripsy ) . Patients agree participate provide consent enrol study , receive randomize allocation , specific data point collect prospectively . Patients consent prior determination prophylaxis collection demographic , disease , perioperative , postoperative data . If patient consent study use antibiotic base routine clinical practice treat urologist . Investigational portion treatment : Patients randomize intervention arm provide single oral dose Ciprofloxacin 500mg time stent removal . Ciprofloxacin currently indicate treatment acute uncomplicated urinary tract infection . Patients fluoroquinalone allergy receive Bactrim ( trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 160/800mg ) single dose instead Ciprofloxacin . Those patient develop infectious complication stent removal treat empirically base preference treat physician follow culture specific antibiotic . Centeral prophylaxis randomization take place UCSD , lead site , use staff member involve patient management . Randomization occur block randomization block size 10 . Standard care procedures Patients cystoscopy stent removal perform standard fashion , without deviation standard care . The time frame stent removal initial stone procedure consistent current standard care . If treat physician 's preference maintain patient 's indwelling stent longer two week , patient would consider study . No patient 's management course alter inclusion study . All female patient screen urinary pregnancy test preoperative screen visit , occur kidney stone surgery . Any pregnant female patient exclude participation study . Post-operative instruction include refrain sexual activity . Cystoscopic stent removal perform within 14 day surgery . Demographic field obtain preoperatively include age , race , gender , body mass index ( BMI ) , comorbidities include history diabetes mellitus , immunosuppression , prior urinary tract infection ( ) , neurogenic bladder , incomplete bladder empty . Pre-operative clinical data point include kidney stone size ( large diameter measure coronal imaging either kidney-ureter-bladder plain x-ray computerized tomography ) pre-operative urine culture result . Post-procedure field include post-void residual urine volume per bladder scan ( assess empty capability ) , culture urine collect stent removal ( treated antibiotic patient becomes symptomatic - per standard care ) , stone culture result , stone analysis , stone-free status . Phone call interview occur 7-14 day post-operatively determine post-operative infectious event occur . Any infectious symptom ( see ) prompt mid-stream clean catch specimen urinalysis urine culture . During period , patient closely observe infectious complication -- ie . symptomatic urinary tract infection , define presence bacteruria ( &gt; 5k colony form unit ) follow : fever &gt; 38 C , malodorous urine , dysuria , urinary frequency , urinary urgency , low abdominal discomfort , back pain , gross hematuria . . Patients evaluate 8 week re-assessment clinic renal bladder ultrasound perform 6 week , routine post-operative care .</detailed_description>
