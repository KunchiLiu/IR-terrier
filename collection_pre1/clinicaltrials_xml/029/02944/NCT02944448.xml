	<brief_title>A Study Evaluating Pain Relief Safety Orally Administered CR845 Patients With Osteoarthritis Hip Knee</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , titration-to-effect study orally administer CR845 patient osteoarthritis hip knee . The study schedule consist Screening Period ( 14 day ) , blind 4- week Titration-to-Effect Period weekly visit , blind 4-week Maintenance Treatment Period optimal dose level determine patient , 1-week Follow-up Period . Eligible patient randomize receive either CR845 placebo 2:1 ratio . Randomization stratify base patient 's primary OA joint ( knee vs. hip ) . Every patient start 1-mg dose CR845 match placebo . During post-randomization Titration-to-Effect period , dose study drug may increase 2.5 mg 5 mg double-blind fashion . Patients may know dose change know whether randomize active study drug placebo . Approximately 330 patient enrol study . During Screening , Titration-to-Effect Follow-up Period , pain intensity score obtain specify time point . Blood sample safety assessment conducted period well . The use rescue medication treatment pain ( include limit headache , menstrual cramp , non-target joint pain ) study discuss patient Screening Visit . Acetaminophen allowable rescue medication pain begin Day -5 end Maintenance Treatment Period . Starting Screening Visit Acetaminophen provide 325-mg tablet use ( number tablet take previous 24 hour ) report evening patient diary .</detailed_description>
