	<detailed_description>Cognitive deficit important cause long-term dysfunction patient Neurofibromatosis type 1 ( NF1 ) . Among frequently-occurring difficulty problem attention , work memory , executive functioning . Remediation intervention improve deficit potential impact quality life long-term prognosis population . Cognitive training ( CT ) program increasingly use independently conjunction pharmacotherapies child accidental disease-related brain injury . CogmedRM well-researched widely-used CT program remediation WM deficit . Results numerous randomize , control trial conduct variety pediatric adult patient population generally show CogmedRM training associate robust gain performance-based WM score short term , variability improvement across disease group . A single arm pilot study CogmedRM sample child NF1 conduct Children 's National Medical Center show approach likely feasible acceptable family . Because many child NF1 treat stimulant medication , biological evidence CT Methylphenidate act dopaminergic system , investigator also interested examine whether synergistic effect widely available safe intervention . Thus , aim ass efficacy home-based , computerized cognitive training ( CT ) program sample 90 child age 8-16 NF1 work memory difficulty . This study conduct span four year . If participant qualifies follow baseline test , he/she randomize intervention , CogmedRM , active control condition , MobyMax ( online reading program ) . The participant 5-9 week complete program follow-up test 2 week finish program . If CT , either singly combination stimulant medication , show efficacious sample NF1 pediatric patient high risk neurocognitive deficit , intervention plan could rapidly translate clinical practice .</detailed_description>
