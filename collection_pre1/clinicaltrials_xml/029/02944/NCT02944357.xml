	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study well gemcitabine hydrochloride , cisplatin , AGS-003-BLD work treat patient bladder cancer spread muscle undergo surgery . Drugs use chemotherapy , gemcitabine hydrochloride cisplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Vaccines make person 's tumor cell may help body build effective immune response kill tumor cell . Giving gemcitabine hydrochloride , cisplatin , AGS-003-BLD surgery may make tumor small reduce amount tissue need remove surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess immunogenicity AGS-003-BLD subject muscle invasive bladder cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess 1-year disease-free survival rate patient muscle-invasive bladder cancer receive cisplatin/gemcitabine chemotherapy plus AGS-003-BLD . II . To determine time first metastatic lesion . III . To explore disease-free overall survival patient treat treatment combination . IV . To evaluate pathologic complete response ( pCR ) rate identify activity treatment combination . V. To evaluate toxicity tolerability associate treatment combination . VI . To assess success rate tumor procurement AGS-003-BLD production &gt; = 5 dos . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate relationship pathologic complete response change CD28+ T cell level . II . To evaluate change frequency CD11a highPD-1+ CD8+ T cell ( expression Bim ) peripheral blood . OUTLINE : NEOADJUVANT PHASE : Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) day 1 8 , AGS-003-BLD intradermally ( ID ) day 1 , cisplatin IV day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients receive AGS-003-BLD ID day 1 . Treatment repeat every 14 day 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . SURGERY : Patients undergo cystectomy course 8 . ADJUVANT PHASE : Patients continue AGS-003-BLD ID day 1 course 9 . Treatment repeat every 12 week 9 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
