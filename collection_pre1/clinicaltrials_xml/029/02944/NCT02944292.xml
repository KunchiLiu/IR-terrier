	<brief_title>Effect Sedation Intra-abdominal Pressure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The importance intra-abdominal pressure ( IAP ) critically ill patient address increasingly . Several study show elevated mean IAP associate adverse ICU outcome . The prevalence intra-abdominal hypertension ( IAH ) among critically ill patient high 50 % define accord maximal IAP half define accord mean IAP . Development IAH ICU period independent risk factor death . Considering significant impact patient ' outcome , international conference expert agree publish recommendation treatment IAH abdominal compartment syndrome . Among others , deepen sedation suggest treatment option . The recommendation base expert opinion ; control clinical study available support approach . Importantly , recent study show deep sedation may associate bad outcome patient . Treggiari et al suggest strategy light sedation affords benefit regard reduction intensive care unit stay duration ventilation without negatively affect subsequent patient mental health patient safety . Others show reduced ICU mortality well reduce incidence ventilator-associated pneumonia conjunction light sedation . This prospective , interventional , multicentre study . There control group . Study subject : Adult , mechanically ventilated patient IAP 12 20 mmHg least two consecutive measurement , spontaneous breathe activity least 6 breaths/minute , RASS score 0 -4 , contraindication propofol administration present intervention reduce IAP plan . Study intervention : Sedation deepen achieve bolus propofol 1 mg/kg follow continuous infusion propofol 3 mg/kg/h one hour . Patients previously receive propofol infusion receive supplemental propofol per protocol maximum infusion rate 5 mg/kg/h . Series measurement IAP perform ( ) ( repeatedly ) intervention ( deepen sedation ) . Deepness sedation assess RASS score .</detailed_description>
