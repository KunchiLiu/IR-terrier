Despite promise HPV vaccine prevention cervical cancer , widespread availability vaccine limit due cost accessibility . Therefore , prevention strategy reduce cervical cancer HPV exposure entail treatment severe premalignant state ( high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion HSIL ) . As procedure expensive widely available resource-limited area need inexpensive , non-invasive alternative method treat premalignant cervical lesion . Curcumin , extract turmeric , popular culinary spice , use traditional Indian medicine anti-inflammatory anti-infectious property . Recent study show potential effect curcumin reduce tumor precancerous lesion animal human cancer cell . It postulate curcumin achieves effect cancer cell modulate different cellular pathway well alter HPV effect tissue cell . This study explore effect curcumin potential medical treatment HIV-infected woman HSIL lesion cervix . 40 woman high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion ( HSIL ) cervix enrol either insert 2000 mg capsule curcumin placebo vagina daily 12 week . After 4 week long washout period participant undergo removal precancerous cell recommend standard care . Participants regular monthly visit duration study .</detailed_description>
