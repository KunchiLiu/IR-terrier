	<brief_title>The Effect Self-rehabilitation Program Addition Usual Treatment Spasticity Impairment Activity Limitation Patients With Spastic Hemiparesis Following Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stroke affect 150 000 person France year . Most patient activity limitation result motor deficit spasticity . Autonomy activity daily live reduce . The principal treatment focal spasticity currently intramuscular botulinum toxin injection ( Botulinum Toxin Injections ) . Botulinum Toxin Injections classically combine 2 3 session out-patient physiotherapy per week . This mainly lack out-patient therapist . However , amount therapy insufficient follow current literature show intensity physiotherapy affect recovery impairment activity . This gap health system could fill self-rehabilitation program addition physiotherapy . Recent study show self-rehabilitation follow Botulinum Toxin Injections could significantly improve activity limitation . The addition self-rehabilitation program Botulinum Toxin Injections usual out-patient physiotherapy could thus increase effect Botulinum Toxin Injections impairment activity limitation patient spastic hemiparesis follow stroke .</detailed_description>
