	<brief_summary>This study randomize control trial liquefy petroleum gas ( LPG ) stave fuel distribution 3,200 household four country ( India , Guatemala , Peru , Rwanda ) . Following common protocol , intervention site recruit 800 pregnant woman ( age 18-34 year , &lt; 20 week gestation ) , randomly assign half household receive LPG stoves 30-month supply LPG . Controls receive cookstove LPG supply end study . The mother follow along child child 2 year old . The researcher estimate 25 % household second , non-pregnant older adult woman ( age 35-64 year ) also enrol baseline follow 30-month follow-up period . To optimize intervention use , researcher implement behavior change strategy inform previous experience formative research Year 1 . This study assess cookstove use , conduct repeat personal exposure assessment household air pollution , collect dry blood spot urinary sample biomarker analysis biospecimen storage . The primary outcome low birthweight , pneumonia incidence , linear growth child , blood pressure old adult woman . Secondary outcome include preterm birth gross motor development child , maternal blood pressure pregnancy , endothelial function , respiratory impairment , carcinogenic metabolite , quality life old adult woman .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Household Air Pollution Health : A Multi-country LPG Intervention Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Globally , nearly 3 billion people rely solid fuel cook heating , vast majority low- middle-income country ( LMICs ) . The result household air pollution ( HAP ) third lead risk factor 2010 global burden disease , account estimate 4.3 million death annually , largely among woman young child . Previous intervention provide clean biomass-based cookstove , fail reduce exposure level produce meaningful health improvement . There large-scale field trial liquefy petroleum gas ( LPG ) cookstoves , likely cleanest scalable intervention . The aim study conduct randomize control trial LPG stove fuel distribution 3,200 household four LMICs ( India , Guatemala , Peru , Rwanda ) deliver rigorous evidence regard potential health benefit across lifespan . Each intervention site recruit 800 pregnant woman ( age 18-34 year , &lt; 20 week gestation ) , randomly assign half household receive LPG stoves 30-month supply LPG . Controls receive cookstove LPG supply end study . The mother follow along child child 2 year old . In households second , non-pregnant older adult woman ( age 35-64 year ) researcher also enroll follow 30-month follow-up period order ass cardiopulmonary , metabolic , cancer outcome . To optimize intervention use , researcher implement behavior change strategy . This study assess cookstove use , conduct repeat personal exposure assessment HAP ( PM2.5 , black carbon , carbon monoxide ) , collect dry blood spot urinary sample biomarker analysis biospecimen storage participant multiple time point . The primary outcome low birth weight , pneumonia incidence , linear growth child , blood pressure old adult woman . Secondary outcome include preterm birth gross motor development child , maternal blood pressure pregnancy , endothelial function , respiratory impairment , carcinogenic metabolite , quality life old adult woman . This study address follow specific aim : ( 1 ) use intent-to-treat analysis , determine effect randomize LPG stave fuel intervention health four diverse LMIC population use common protocol ; ( 2 ) determine exposure-response relationship HAP health ; ( 3 ) determine relationship LPG intervention target exploratory biomarkers exposure/health effect . This study provide compel evidence , include cost implementation strategy , inform national global policy scale LPG stove among vulnerable population . Ultimately , facilitate deep policy-level discussion well identify requirement initiate sustain HAP intervention globally .</detailed_description>
