	<brief_summary>The objective pilot study evaluate efficacy intensive fix monthly dose intravitreal Lucentis® ( Ranibizumab ) treatment SRF PED neovascular AMD persistent anti-VEGF ( anti-vascular endothelial growth factor ) monotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Fixed Monthly Dosing Ranibizumab Neovascular Age-related Macular Degeneration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PEDs occur 62 % eye advance AMD . Numerous treatment option employ PEDs AMD , include laser therapy intravitreal injection anti-VEGF antibody . However , eye PEDs exclude large clinical trial use macular laser , photodynamic therapy , ranibizumab treat neovascular AMD ; therefore , efficacy option still unclear eye PEDs neovascular AMD . Additionally , PED lesion report show less morphological functional response anti-VEGF monotherapy eye CNV lesion subtypes . Based generally poor prognosis PEDs lack sufficient data literature regard effectiveness fix monthly dose Lucentis® ( Ranibizumab ) therapy , investigator design prospective study evaluate effect intensive fix monthly dose Ranibizumab treatment SRF associate PED neovascular AMD persistent previous anti-VEGF monotherapy .</detailed_description>
