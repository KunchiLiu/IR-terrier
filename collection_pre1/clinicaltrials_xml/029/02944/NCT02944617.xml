	<brief_title>Probiotic Yogurt Supplement Reducing Diarrhea Patients With Metastatic Kidney Cancer Being Treated With Sunitinib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine add Activia yogurt ( contain Bifidobacterium lactis DN-172 010 ) diet patient metastatic renal cell carcinoma ( mRCC ) increase level Bifidobacterium spp stool . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine Activia reduces incidence diarrhea mRCC patient treat sunitinib therapy . II . To compare pre-treatment level circulate T regulatory ( Treg ) cell level peripheral signal transducer activator transcription 3 ( STAT3 ) patient without diarrhea sunitinib therapy , correlate Bifidobacterium , bacteria , Activia . III . To determine patient diarrhea mRCC patient treat sunitinib therapy low baseline Bifidobacterium spp . IV . To assess change global stool bacteriomic profile patient receive therapy sunitinib without Activia . V. To better assess feasibility stool collection bacteriomic profile . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 arm . ARM I : Patients receive probiotic supplement Activia yogurt twice daily ( QD ) week 2-13 sunitinib treatment . ARM II : Patients avoid intake yogurt yogurt-containing food refrain taking/consuming probiotic supplement 3 month .</detailed_description>
