	<brief_summary>The propose randomized control trial test efficacy step collaborative care intervention , versus enhance usual care arm , reduce depression cancer caregiver . Biobehavioral factor include assessment change health behavior biomarkers inflammation . The investigator also include measure metabolic abnormality clinical marker CVD .

	<brief_title>Collaborative Care Intervention Cancer Caregivers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator expect follow caregiver 12 month caregiving period . Based prior experience others , patient clinical level symptom report great benefit intervention aim reduce depressive symptom . The investigator screen caregiver clinical level depression use CES-D scale . If caregiver screen positive clinical level depressive symptom ( CES-D &gt; 16 ) patient caregiver consent participation , dyad randomize intervention enhance usual care arm base block randomization stratification gender ( male/female ) assure approximate equal gender distribution arm study . The screen take place UPMC Montefiore Presbyian . The participant study blind arm intervention receive , either step collaborative care enhance usual care . Prior randomization ask provide information intervention prefer end intervention ask intervention think receive . The finding analyze determine intervention preference perception intervention receive affected outcome . The care coordinator propose intervention Master 's degree psychology counsel train cognitive-behavioral therapy experience work people diagnosed cancer family . The care coordinator receive train University Pittsburgh cultural competence . The therapist serve liaison patient health care professional within spousal intimate partner caregiver ' medical team . A psychiatrist include part study team many spousal intimate partner caregiver reside locally . The care coordinator work spousal intimate partner caregiver ' PCP , psychiatrist , health care provider spousal intimate partner caregiver ' home community manage symptoms medication indicate . The care coordinator supervise PI clinical psychologist work cancer patient caregivers 20 year . Patient caregiver outcome assess use battery standardized questionnaire . The investigator choose instrument brief possible limit burden patient spousal intimate partner caregiver . All instrument demonstrate valid reliable . The order instrument battery questionnaires begin general , emotionally laden instrument also end instrument may increase distress participant . The proposed time point ( baseline , 4 , 8 , 12 month ) reflect interval permit ability capture change symptoms inflammatory biomarkers burden patient spousal/intimate partner caregiver . The proposed questionnaire use prior study team advanced cancer patient family caregiver . The investigator show well adherence complete outcome measure self-reported pencil paper questionnaires versus telephone interview ( K07CA118576 ; R01CA176809 ) . However , investigator also offer telephone interview spousal intimate partner caregiver patient low level literacy , sensory impairment , prefer telephone interview . For interview , research associate blind participant 's assigned treatment arm prevent bias . The investigator find difference method administration ( paper pencil versus telephone interview ) . Inter-operator variability address ensure research staff perform measurement blood pressure , waist circumference train together , test PI inter-operator consistency , assessed interval every 4 month continue consistency measurement blood pressure abdominal girth . Consistency laboratory personnel technique ( inter operator variability ) monitor Dr. Butterfield . The frequency distribution study variable examine prior statistical analysis provide descriptive data identify departures normality . If nonlinearity detect , transformation perform use Box-Cox transformation , find optimal relationship variable . All measure establish reliability validity similar study sample drawn ; however , reliability scale assess use Cronbach 's Î± . Data analyze use SAS ( Version 9.3 , SAS Institute , Inc. , Cary , NC ) conduct preliminary exploratory analysis , miss data testing , analyse primary aim ( linear mixed model ) . The level significance analyse set .05 . The efficacy web-based step collaborative care intervention compare enhance usual care examine use 'intent treat ' ( ITT ) approach , well actual treatment receive . In ITT approach , subject include analysis group randomly assign , regardless treatment , adherence , withdrawal deviation protocol . The ITT approach minimize introduction bias analyse closely aligns clinical practice ; therefore , strongly recommended study examine intervention efficacy .</detailed_description>
