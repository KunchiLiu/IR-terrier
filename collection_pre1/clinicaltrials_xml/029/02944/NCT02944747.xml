	<detailed_description>Background : Bangladesh high maternal ( 194 per 100,000 live birth ) newborn mortality ( 28 per 1000 live birth ) ( 1-3 ) . In 2010 , prematurity represent ~14 % birth directly indirectly contribute 45 % neonatal death ( 4 , 5 ) . Accurate estimation gestational age ( GA ) critical provide optimal clinical care prenatal , delivery postnatal period public health intervention ( 6 ) . Knowing GA week essential determine adequacy fetal growth , correct diagnosis preterm post-term labor also correct use many intervention ( e.g. , antenatal corticosteroid therapy , tocolytics , continuous positive airway pressure ) target improve maternal newborn outcome ( 7 ) . Three method GA estimation primarily use - menstrual base dating ( LMP ) , ultrasonography ( USG ) neonatal assessment , strengths weakness ( 8 ) . USG , base biometric measurement fetus , consider gold standard do 20 week gestation i.e. , biologic variation fetal size effect growth restriction low ( 9 ) . However , accuracy USG decrease do latter trimester , particularly setting high intrauterine growth restriction , Bangladesh ( 10 ) . However , USG often unavailable low-resource country , especially rural area . Even available , equipment poor quality operate personnel minimal expertise ( 10 ) . In addition , pregnancy often identify 2nd 3rd trimester woman often seek antenatal care late pregnancy , limit use USG ass GA ( 10-12 ) . Alternate method assess GA therefore prefer setting . One approach use neonatal assessment base standardized score system physical neuromuscular maturity . These , however , less precise obstetric estimate also require skilled personnel frequently practical ( 13 ) . Dating base LMP another alternative . It simple , low-cost method recommend World Health Organization ( 14 ) . However , several study show approximately 15-45 % pregnant woman unable recall LMP accurately result unreliable estimate digit preference ( 15-17 ) . Recall period crucial determinant influence accuracy LMP . Literature suggest LMP recall precise shorter recall period . ( 15 ) Accuracy recall LMP also limit due irregularity individual variation length menstrual cycle , short birth spacing , preconception amenorrhea implantation bleeding ( 18 , 19 ) . This complicate late presentation first antenatal care consultation provider minimal skill probe accurate LMP date . Reliance LMP alone show tendency overestimate GA extremes gestation common woman low education live poverty ( 15 , 20 ) . Despite limitation , study conduct Bangladesh Guatemala suggest LMP prefer method determine GA low-resource setting ( 10 , 21 ) . The study therefore aim determine efficacy three intervention target improve recall reporting LMP among woman rural Bangladesh . The intervention include conventional LMP date calendar well innovative e-platform - mobile phone smart phone application . Although calendar , menstrual dairy already try clinical setting record menstrual date , public health implication use tool record LMP yet explore ( 15 , 22 ) . Moreover , use health provide health education already show impact improve coverage maternal health service . ( 23 ) Additionally , provide educational health promotion message , tele-consultation , prescription referral mobile phone become increasingly popular Bangladesh due nationwide coverage mobile network , availability cheap hand set , increase use smart phone cheap call rate . The grow investment public private sector Information Communications Techonology ( ICT ) see substantial access acceptance technology among general public , especially poor . In 2013 , 105 million active mobile phone subscriber 75 % household rural area own mobile phone ( 3 , 24 ) . The current Government 's mandate build Digital Bangladesh also include provision Quality Healthcare citizens innovative application ICT . A recent WHO report indicate health education deliver health ministry 98 % target population SMS . All initiative support potential financial viability eHealth mHealth Bangladesh raise clear opportunity term healthcare provision scale-up ( 24 ) . Hypothesis : 1 . Implementation conventional e-platform base intervention lead 30 % improvement recall date LMP adolescent girl marry woman rural Bangladesh . 2 . Intervention trigger improvement LMP date recall among pregnant woman rural Bangladesh improve accuracy GA estimation 15 % . Specific Objectives : The specific objective : 1 . Determine whether set conventional e-platform base intervention improve recall date LMP adolescent girl marry woman rural Bangladesh . 2 . Determine whether intervention trigger improvement LMP date recall report rural Bangladesh improve accuracy GA estimation . Study Design : In order achieve objective , 4- parallel arm , superiority , community base cluster randomize control trial compare conventional e-platform base intervention propose improve recall GA intervention control group . The trial conduct among two group participants- adolescent girl recently marry woman ( within past two year ) child single child rural community Bangladesh . The four arm : Arm 1 : Control arm . Arm 2 : Education importance remember date LMP paper base calendar help remember record date LMP month . Arm 3 : Education cell-phone base SMS alert system participant ask text LMP date every month , free cost . In situation , participant fail text , provide SMS reminder . Arm 4 : Education smart-phone base application record menstrual date every month . Setting : The study carry Mirzapur sub-district Tangail district locate northwest Dhaka city , capital Bangladesh . Administratively Mirzapur 13 union ( low administrative body ) , 219 village cover area 375 sq . km population 3,37,496. icddr , b exist demographic surveillance system ( DSS ) Mirzapur cover 288,395 population 10 union , data collect 17 surveillance worker four monthly round . The trial implement exist surveillance area ease identification enrollment study participant . Table 1 also provide estimate number adolescent 2014 married woman single child start 2014 . Participants : Adolescent girl ( 15-17 year ) recently marry woman ( within past two year ) child single child reside select village , willing participate study recruit . Randomization , invitation , recruitment consent : The trial administrator study responsible randomize cluster study arm . The DSS area consist 1360 block , population 212 assign 17 surveillance worker . For purpose trial 136 cluster form 10 block i.e. , cluster population 2120 . The trial administrator randomize cluster four arm ( 34 cluster ) use computer generate randomization schedule . To ensure cluster DSS data collector chance receive intervention , randomization stratify surveillance worker ' area . This design control potential confounding factor ( observe unobserved ) well selection bias especially random assignment intervention control cluster level . We try ensure minimal chance spill participant community block receive intervention try keep geographical buffer cluster . Following randomization cluster , require sample adolescent married woman per cluster select list eligible participant generate DSS database . Those agree contact recruit study write informed consent . Later LMP date recruit participant collect fortnightly 3 month arm follow baseline assessment . Interventions roll baseline assessment person conduct participate survey aware intervention group . The sample size calculation elaborate section Sample size . Intervention activity : ( ) Intervention package duration Three intervention test study . These described : Intervention 1 : This intervention entail education documentation menstrual bleed paper base calendar . The participant counsel importance remember LMP . In addition , free calendar provide participant ask record menstrual bleed spot date month . The woman ask record `` bleeding '' bleed particular month . Likewise , anybody forgets record , ask keep record subsequent month . Female counselor study team conduct group individual education session . Intervention 2 : Participants intervention receive education cell-phone base record SMS alert system . Cell-phones provide free cost participant ask text bleeding date menstruation spot every month within 3 day start bleed . Study team collaborate mobile phone company charge SMS report LMP date free user . In situation , participant fails text , provide several SMS reminder due date . Intervention 3 : Participants intervention arm receive education free smart-phone application record menstruation date inbuilt reminder system . Experienced programmer icddr , b involve develop application . Again , participant ask record bleeding date month upload data central server via internet . If participant fail record date upload data , automatic reminder send . ( ii ) Enrolment intervention The study participant ( adolescent girl &amp; recently marry woman ) select use DSS database recruit LMP surveillance get write informed consent . Thereafter , would offer either three intervention : menstrual tracking calendar , SMS smart phone base LMP record system ( per intervention design ) . Following enrolment study , group individual counseling session conduct female counselor educate participant importance remember LMP date use tool record LMP month . The roll intervention cluster specific follow sequence baseline survey do . ( iii ) Delivering intervention Education provide female counselor individual group session immediately baseline survey . The topic education include importance remember record menstrual bleeding pattern date . Calendar , mobile phone smart phone give recruit participant free cost study bear cost SMS internet upload data . The counselor also teach participant record date use different tool . The intervention reinforce intensively every month first 3 month later intensity reinforcement adjust depend compliance use tool . Methods data collection : 1 . Data collection employ follow technique : 2 . Household survey arm 3 . LMP surveillance arm 4 . Data extraction intervention tool . 5 . Pregnancy surveillance intervention arm ( ) Household survey : Household survey conduct eligible adolescent recently marry woman arm two point time : baseline- start intervention end project , 12 month intervention arm . Any household participants/guardian present time survey visit second third time . If additional visit unsuccessful participant exclude . Face-to face interview conduct trained data collector use structured questionnaire ( annex X ) elicit require information . Outcome variable : Recalled report date LMP past 3 month prior survey level certainty reporting date Explanatory variable : 1 . Demographic characteristic participant include age , sex , education occupation 2 . Household socio-economic profile include housing status , asset , monthly income , ownership mobile phone &amp; accessibility mobile phone etc . 3 . Birth history use contraceptive marry woman 4 . Information menstrual irregularity , gynaecological problem 5 . Acceptability , challenge adherence tool ( applicable ) ( ii ) LMP surveillence arm : LMP date recruit participant collect actively every two week actual date LMP record arm 3 month baseline endline survey . No information elicit participant . ( iii ) Data extraction intervention tool : Data extract calendar record , SMS smart-phones . The data mobile SMS obtain every month mobile company whereas user smart-phone ask upload data via internet connect cell-phone . For participant use calendar , data collector collect information enrol household every two month . ( iv ) Pregnancy surveillance intervention arm : Pregnancy surveillance continue throughout intervention period among recently marry woman enrol intervention arm . In case missed period report calendar failure SMS smart phone base LMP reporting , surveillance worker visit enrol recently marry woman 's house . Surveillance worker complete round every 8 week . Any woman miss period within one year recruitment pregnancy confirm test recall LMP date collect . They follow 20 week pregnancy USG assessments do 10-13 week gestation . The study bear cost USG associate travel . Study team : ( ) Central The study conduct central team investigator field research team . The Central team compose one principle investigator , one MNCS expert external co-principle investigator 2 research investigator ( 1 full time equivalent ) . The Central team responsible overall study design , seek ethical approval , tool development , field implementation quality assurance . ( ii ) Intervention implementation team The intervention implementation team comprise female counselor , immediate supervisor manager . It estimate 15 counselor ( 5 per intervention arm ) require train/educate participant ( 2400 ; see sample size section detail ) intervention arm period 1-2 month . As mention earlier , female counselor conduct education session twice project implementation period ; begin six month intervention . There one immediate supervisor counselor arm intervention activity monitor field manager . ( ii ) Data collection team The study require approximately 3200 participant estimate require effect size ( detailed section sample size calculation ) . Based assumption , estimate study require fifteen data collector carry survey two month study area . Additionally , 10 data collector deploy collect regular LMP data arm 3 month baseline enline survey 5 data collector pregnancy surveillance throughout project period . The project employ 2 immediate supervisor data collector manager monitor activity data collection team . Sample size : Sample size calculate observe expect change primary outcome measure use formula comparison two proportion presence clustering . The investigator expect intervention arm minimum 30 % relative improvement accuracy LMP recall comparison control arm intention compare intervention due resource constraint . Assuming rural context Bangladesh approximately 55 % woman accurately recall LMP , measure 30 % expect change recall implementation intervention , require 238 participant 34 cluster per arm assume 5 % level significance 90 % power . Accounting 15 % refusal 20 % loss follow-up require approximately 400 adolescent 400 recently marry woman ( within past 2 year ) child one child arm . Hence , 1600 adolescent 1600 recently marry woman require four arm . . The second outcome aim assess accuracy LMP base GA assessment intervention arm compare USG base GA. As mention subset recently marry woman , become pregnant within year enrollment recruit study . The study conduct Shishu Hospital Bangladesh ( 10 ) , show intra class correlation coefficient LMP base GA measurement versus USG base GA measurement 0.84 . Considering change 15 % estimate due intervention , sample 120 pregnancy require assume 80 % power , 5 % level significance 20 % refusal loss follow-up . Women become pregnant pool 1200 marry woman three intervention arm follow 16 week gestation ask undertake USG GA measurement 10-13 week . Surveillance data Mirzapur show approximately 11 % recently marry woman become pregnant within next year . Hence , The investigator assume get approximately 120 pregnant woman 1200 married woman intervention group . Data analysis : Data analysis do follow intention treat analysis guidance experience statistician . Analyses conduct individual level , adjust cluster randomization . For primary outcome first validate tool compare distribution record LMP date intervention arm different point time ( baseline endpoint ) actual LMP date collect LMP surveillance . We examine proportion woman exactly report accurate LMP date . Differences difference method use ascertain change proportion woman accurately report LMP date level certainty reporting LMP date . Accuracy LMP date ascertain survey surveillance date match within +/- 1 day variation individual . Level certainty report LMP date assess use Likart scale . The analysis adjust confounders education , socio-economic status length recall time . Additionally , explore change mean standard deviation report LMP compare actual LMP recall period . For second outcome compare GA calculate LMP USG ( gold standard ) use mean ( student t-test ) distribution . Convergent validity also assess estimate GA LMP USG use intra-class correlation coefficient , Lin 's concordance coefficient Bland-altman analysis exact comparison continuous value .
