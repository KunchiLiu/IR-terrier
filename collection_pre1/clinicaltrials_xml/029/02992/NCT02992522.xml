	<brief_summary>This phase I study study side effect best dose venetoclax lenalidomide give together obinutuzumab treat patient B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma return period improvement respond treatment . Monoclonal antibody , obinutuzumab , may interfere ability cancer cell grow spread . Venetoclax may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , lenalidomide , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving obinutuzumab , venetoclax , lenalidomide may work well treat patient B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Obinutuzumab , Venetoclax , Lenalidomide Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) recommend phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) , typically maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) , combination obinutuzumab , venetoclax , lenalidomide patient relapse refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate overall objective response rate combination obinutuzumab , venetoclax , lenalidomide patient relapse refractory B-cell NHL . II . To estimate duration response 2 year progression-free survival associate obinutuzumab , venetoclax , lenalidomide treatment patient relapse refractory B-cell NHL . III . To define qualitative quantitative toxicity combination obinutuzumab , venetoclax , lenalidomide patient relapse refractory B-cell NHL . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study venetoclax lenalidomide . Patients receive lenalidomide orally ( PO ) day 1-21 venetoclax PO day 1-28 . Patients also receive obinutuzumab intravenously ( IV ) day 1 , 8 , 15 course 1 day 1 course 2-6 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week , every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month .</detailed_description>
