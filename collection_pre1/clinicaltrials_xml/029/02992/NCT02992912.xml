	<brief_summary>Although usually describe immunosuppressive modality think immunotherapy , new preclinical evidence suggest high-dose ionizing irradiation ( IR ) result direct tumour cell death augments tumour-specific immunity , enhance tumour control locally distantly . Importantly , IR effect exceed classical cytocidal property also cause phenotypic change fraction survive cell , markedly enhance susceptibility T cell-mediated elimination . However , IR-induced modification tumour microenvironment favor immune rejection . The tumour microenvironment populate various type inhibitory immune cell include Tregs , alternatively activated macrophage , myeloid-derived suppression cell ( MDSCs ) , suppress T cell activation promote tumour outgrowth . Chiang et al . show accumulation pro-tumourigenic M2 macrophage area hypoxia present irradiated tumour . IR may also induce response inadequate maintain antitumuor immunity . Close interaction IR , T cell , PD-L1/PD-1 axis exsit provide basis rational design combination therapy immune modulators radiotherapy . Deng et al . demonstrate PD-L1 upregulated tumour microenvironment IR . Moreover , administration anti-PD-L1 enhance efficacy IR cytotoxic T cell-dependent mechanism . Concomitant IR-mediated tumour regression , IR anti-PD-L1 synergistically reduce local accumulation tumour-infiltrating MDSCs , suppress T cell alter tumour immune microenvironment . Finally , activation cytotoxic T cell combination therapy mediate reduction MDSCs tumours cytotoxic action TNF . Sagiv-Barfi et al , also demonstrate 5 patient receive atezolizumab radiation therapy , least stabilization systemic progression patient RECIST partial response systemic sit 1 patient . Transient , grade 1-2 inflammatory adverse event ( fever , flu-like symptom ) occur serious immune-related toxicity . Abscopal out-field effect irradiation also describe addition reduction circulate MDSCs melanoma patient treat anti CTLA-4 ipilimumab radiotherapy . Lastly , recent evidence demonstrate loco-regional curative treatment stereotactic ablative radiotherapy ( SABR ) good alternative compare conventional 3D RT patient solid tumour , durable remission low toxicity profile . Many non-randomised study show SBRT oligometastases safe effective , local control rate 80 % . Importantly , study also suggest natural history disease change , 2-5 year progression-free survival 20 % . For colorectal , non-small cell , renal cell cancer , 1-year metastasis control rate range 67 91 % . The goal SABR deliver appropriate metastasis direct radiotherapy minimizing exposure surround normal tissue . Interestingly , dose fractionation employ modulate RT ability synergize immunotherapy . Vanpouille-Box et al , show immune response gene differentially express irradiated tumour 8Gyx3 20Gyx1 . This highlight interest hypofractionated SABR act `` situ tumour vaccine '' . As hypofractionated SABR may , addition good local control , increase effectiveness anti PD-L1 , investigator aim investigate efficacy tolerability combination anti-PD-L1 antibody SABR .</brief_summary>
