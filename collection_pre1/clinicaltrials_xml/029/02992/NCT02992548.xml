	<brief_summary>Treatment use statin decrease risk cardiovascular event pre-dialysis CKD population . Supplementation omega-3 fatty acid ( FA ) lower risk cardiovascular death patient myocardial infarction . This cardioprotective effect omega-3 FA explain anti-inflammatory , anti-oxidative , anti-thrombotic effect . Statin pravastatin also know anti-inflammatory antioxidant property , suggest statin may replace cardioprotective effect omega-3 fatty acid . Erythrocyte membrane oleic acid significantly high patient acute coronary syndrome control subject . The cardioprotective effect omega-3 FA may also relate decreased oleic acid content erythrocyte membrane . There report effect statin FA include erythrocyte membrane oleic acid . As omega-3 FAs recognize therapeutic agent reduce triglyceride , statin may affect erythrocyte membrane FA . Therefore , pravastatin supplementation modify erythrocyte membrane FA content include oleic acid CKD patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) high risk death cardiovascular disease general population . Treatment use statin decrease risk cardiovascular event pre-dialysis CKD population . Supplementation omega-3 fatty acid ( FA ) lower risk cardiovascular death patient myocardial infarction . This cardioprotective effect omega-3 FA explain anti-inflammatory , anti-oxidative , anti-thrombotic effect . Statin pravastatin also know anti-inflammatory antioxidant property , suggest statin may replace cardioprotective effect omega-3 fatty acid . Omega-3 FA EPA ( eicosapentaenoic acid ) , DHA ( docosahexaenoic acid ) , EPA/arachidonic acid ratio well know key indicator cardiovascular disease . In addition , erythrocyte membrane oleic acid significantly high patient acute coronary syndrome control subject . The cardioprotective effect omega-3 FA may also relate decreased oleic acid content erythrocyte membrane . There report effect statin FA include erythrocyte membrane oleic acid . As omega-3 FAs recognize therapeutic agent reduce triglyceride , statin may affect erythrocyte membrane FA . Therefore , pravastatin supplementation modify erythrocyte membrane FA content include oleic acid CKD patient .</detailed_description>
