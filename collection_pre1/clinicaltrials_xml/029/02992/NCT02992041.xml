	<brief_title>Evaluate Analgesic Efficacy Safety VVZ-149 Injections Post-Operative Pain Following Laparoscopic Colorectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>VVZ-149 dual antagonist GlyT2 5HT2A . GlyT2 blockage increase inhibitory synaptic transmission glycine spinal cord , result reduction pain transmission brain . 5HT2A blockage decrease descend serotonergic facilitatory modulation pain transmission brain reduces nociceptor activation peripheral nerve , primary source pain post-surgical pain . VVZ-149 show comparable efficacy morphine well control ( blind , complete randomization positive control ) animal study use rat model post-operative pain formalin-induced pain . The PK/PD study animal indicate therapeutic plasma concentration human subject 600-1,900 ng/ml . A clinical Phase 1 study perform healthy subject show clinically significant adverse event plasma concentration level 3,261 ng/ml brief symptom mild nausea dizziness , mild somnolence plasma exposure level 2,000 ng/ml . A clinical Phase 2 study perform laparoscopic gastrectomy patient show patient receive VVZ-149 reduce opioid consumption surgery compare receive placebo , without significant drug-related adverse event .</detailed_description>
