	<brief_summary>This study men woman type sarcoma return treat , surgically remove . The specific type sarcoma Myxoid / Round Cell Liposarcoma , also know High Grade Myxoid Liposarcoma . In addition disease patient must also tissue type HLA-A*02:01 , HLA-A*02:05 HLA-A*02:06 , sample tumor tissue must test positive NY-ESO-1 protein . The study treatment make patient 's white blood cell call T cell . T cell collect patient sent laboratory genetically modify , aim able destroy cancer cell . Manufacturing T cell take 1 month complete . The T cell give back patient intravenous infusion . The purpose study test whether T cell effect cancer test whether treatment give safely patient disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹T Cells Subjects With Advanced Myxoid/ Round Cell Liposarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open label pilot study gene modify autologous T cell treatment advance myxoid/ round cell liposarcoma high-grade myxoid liposarcoma . Subjects HLA-A*02:01 , HLA-A*02:05 and/or HLA-A*02:06 allele , whose tumor express NY-ESO-1 antigen meet study entry criterion eligible enrollment . Following enrollment , subject undergo leukapheresis collection autologous cell process manufacture NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹T cell investigational product . Once NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹T cell manufacture subject receive lymphodepleting chemotherapy fludarabine cyclophosphamide Days -7 -5 NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹T cell single intravenous infusion Day 1 . Dose range 1 x 10⁹ - 8 x 10⁹ transduced cell . Subjects complete interventional phase study upon confirmation disease progression .</detailed_description>

Subject receive plan receive follow therapy/treatment within follow period prior leukapheresis lymphodepleting chemotherapy : Cytotoxic chemotherapy within 4 week . Immune therapy ( monoclonal antibody therapy , checkpoint inhibitor ) within 4 week . Use anticancer vaccine within 2 month absence tumor response , subject exclude disease respond experimental vaccine give within 6 month . Any previous gene therapy use integrate vector . Corticosteroids immunosuppressive therapy within 2 week . Use inhale topical cutaneous steroid permit . Any previous allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant . Investigational treatment clinical trial within 4 week . 2 . Radiotherapy target lesion within 3 month prior lymphodepleting chemotherapy . A lesion unequivocal progression may consider target lesion . There washout period palliative radiation nontarget lesion . 3 . Subject toxicity previous anticancer therapy must recover ≤ Grade 1 ( except nonclinically significant toxicity , e.g. , alopecia , vitiligo ) . Subjects Grade 2 toxicity deem stable irreversible ( e.g . peripheral neuropathy ) enrol . 4 . Subject history allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition fludarabine , cyclophosphamide agent use study . 5 .
