	<brief_title>Study GD2 Positive Solid Tumors 4SCAR-GD2</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Patients refractory and/or recurrent solid tumor poor prognosis despite complex multimodal therapy ; therefore , novel curative approach need . The investigator attempt use T cell obtain directly patient , genetically modify express 4th generation GD2-specific chimeric antigen receptor ( 4SCAR-GD2 ) . The chimeric antigen receptor ( CAR ) molecules enable T cell recognize kill tumor cell recognition surface antigen , GD2 , express high level tumor cell significant level normal tissue . This study evaluate side effect best dose novel 4th generation anti-GD2 CAR T cell refractory and/or recurrent solid tumor . Design : Participants screen physical exam medical history . Blood urine sample collect . Imaging study bone marrow aspirate may perform . Peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) obtain apheresis , T cell activate modified express 4SCAR-GD2 gene . On Day -5 -7 , PBMC activate enriched T cell , follow 4SCAR-GD2 lentiviral transduction . The total culture time approximately 5-7 day . Participants receive preparative conditioning regimen comprise cyclophosphamide/fludarabine prepare immune system accept modified CAR T cells.The preparative regimen base patient immune condition consistent standard chemotherapy condition regimen .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients tumor receive standard firstline therapy judge nonresectable，metastatic , progressive recurrent . The GD2 antigen status tumor determine eligibility.Positive expression define GD2 antibody stain result base immunohistochemistry flow cytometry analysis . Body weight great equal 10 kg . Age : ≥1 year ≤ 65 year age time enrollment . Life expectancy : least 8 week . Prior Therapy : 1 ) There limit number prior treatment regimen . Any grade 3 4 nonhematologic toxicity previous therapy must resolve grade 2 less . 2 ) Must receive hematopoietic growth factor least 1 week prior mononuclear cell collection . 3 ) At least 7 day must elapse since completion therapy biologic agent , target agent , tyrosine kinase inhibitor metronomic nonmyelosuppressive regimen . 4 ) At least 4 week must elapse since prior therapy include monoclonal antibody . 5 ) At least 1 week since radiation therapy time study entry . Karnofsky/jansky score 60 % great . Cardiac function : Left ventricular ejection fraction great equal 40/55 percent . Pulse Ox great equal 90 % room air . Liver function : define alanine transaminase ( ALT ) &lt; 3x upper limit normal ( ULN ) , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) &lt; 3x ULN ; serum bilirubin alkaline phosphatase &lt; 2x ULN . Renal function : Patients must serum creatinine less 3 time upper limit normal . Marrow function : White blood cell count ≥1000/ul , Absolute neutrophil count ≥500/ul , Absolute lymphocyte count ≥500/ul , Platelet count ≥25,000/ul ( achieve transfusion ) . Patients know bone marrow metastatic disease eligible study long meet hematologic function criterion , marrow disease evaluable hematologic toxicity . For patient enrol study , parent legal guardian must sign informed consent assent . Existing severe illness ( e.g . significant cardiac , pulmonary , hepatic disease , etc . ) major organ dysfunction , exception grade 3 hematologic toxicity . Untreated central nervous system ( CNS ) metastasis : Patients previous CNS tumor involvement treat stable least 6 week follow completion therapy eligible . Previous treatment genetically engineer GD2CAR T cell . Active HIV , Hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) , Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection uncontrolled infection . Patients require systemic corticosteroid immunosuppressive therapy . Evidence tumor potentially cause airway obstruction . Inability comply protocol requirement . Insufficient CAR T cell availability .</criteria>
