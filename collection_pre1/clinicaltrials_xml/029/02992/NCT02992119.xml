	<brief_summary>Targeted malaria elimination ( TME ) , comprise appropriate case management village health worker , vector control mass drug administration , currently implement pilot project select village Greater Mekong Subregion ( GMS ) scale-up intervention regional level underway . Based mathematical modelling , extend post-TME parasitaemia-free period majority villager short 200 day substantially increase chance achieve interruption malaria transmission . Immunogenicity RTS , S great old child , short term malaria protective effect strong overall effect assess 1-2 year . Addition mass RTS , S/AS01E vaccination TME arsenal could provide much need additional protection . Currently safety immunogenicity data use RTS , S/AS01 Asian population . This trial generate require data use vaccine Asian population . For integration current TME activity , provide mass drug administration month M0 , M1 , M2 , would efficient practical provide vaccine interval . To address two round intervention ( M0 , M2 ) three round intervention feasible , one study arm look immune response generate two dos vaccine antimalarial medication . Recent evidence suggest vaccination schedule include fractional dose RTS , S/AS01 ( 1/5th standard dose ) could similarly protective schedule three standard full dos , require less vaccine resource . The trial therefore include study arm assess safety immunogenicity fractional dose schedule . Each participant randomize one follow study arm ratio 20:20:30:30:30:30:30 , follow : - RTS , S/AS01B Fractional dose group ( Group 1 ) - Double RTS , S /AS01E Fractional dose group ( Group 2 ) - RTS , S/AS01E Standard dose group ( Group 3 ) - RTS , S/AS01E + DHA-PIP+PQ Standard dose group ( Group 4 ) - RTS , S/AS01E Fractional dose group ( Group 5 ) - RTS , S/AS01E + DHA-PIP+PQ Fractional dose group ( Group 6 ) - RTS , S/AS01E + DHA-PIP+PQ Fractional two-dose group ( Group 7 )</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This randomize , open-label , single centre , Phase 2 trial RTS , S/AS01 healthy Thai adult . Screening eligibility assessment ( Screening visit ) All potential volunteer screen visit , may take place 30 day prior enrolment . Once informed consent give , screen number assign sequential order . Screening number issue consecutively ( e.g . A-01 , A-02 , A-03… ) . Enrolment , baseline assessment , regimen allocation , first vaccination ( Month 0 / Day 0 visit ; Baseline visit ) All inclusion exclusion criterion check enrolment study . Physical examination perform . Any new medical issue symptom arisen assess . Blood collect baseline parasite microscopy , haemoglobin biochemistry . Participants parasitaemia anaemia treat accord national guideline . Blood collect stored measurement antibody P. falciparum circumsporozoite ( anti-CS antibody ) shipment reference laboratory . Urine collect woman child-bearing age immediate pregnancy test . If inclusion criterion fulfil none exclusion criterion apply , patient enrol study CRF specific participant complete . Regimen allocation administration vaccine ( ) Day 0 . The randomization list prepare MORU . Randomization number generate block , 7 intervention arm ratio 20:20:30:30:30:30:30 , follow : Each participant randomize one follow study arm Group 1 : RTS , S/AS01B Fractional dose group Month 0 Month 1 receive RTS , S/AS01B full dose Month 2 receive RTS , S/AS01B fractional dose ( 1/5th dose ) Group 2 : RTS , S/AS01E Fractional dose group Month 0 Month 1will receive double dose RTS , S/AS01E full dose Month 2 receive double dose RTS , S/AS01E fractional dose ( 1/5th dose ) Group 3 : RTS , S/AS01E Full dose group Month 0 , Month 1 Month 2 receive RTS , S/AS01E full dose Group 4 : RTS , S/AS01E + DHA-PIP+PQ Full dose group Month 0 , Month 1 Month 2 receive RTS , S/AS01E full dose + DHA-PIP+PQ Group 5 : RTS , S/AS01E Fractional dose group Month 0 Month 1 receive RTS , S/AS01E full dose Month 2 receive RTS , S/AS01E fractional dose ( 1/5th dose ) Group 6 : RTS , S/AS01E + DHA-PIP+PQ Fractional dose group Month 0 Month 1 receive RTS , S/AS01E full dose + DHA-PIP+PQ Month 2 receive RTS , S/AS01E fractional dose ( 1/5th dose ) + DHA-PIP+PQ Group 7 : RTS , S/AS01E + DHA-PIP+PQ Fractional two-dose group Month 0 receive RTS , S/AS01E full dose + DHA-PIP+PQ Month 2 receive RTS , S/AS01E fractional dose ( 1/5th dose ) + DHA-PIP+PQ RTS , S/AS01B = Standard dose RTS , S/AS01B : 50µg RTS , S + standard dose AS01B RTS , S/AS01E = Standard dose RTS , S/AS01E : 25µg RTS , S + standard dose AS01E DHA-PIP = Dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine PQ = Primaquine Study participant assign next available randomization number list , thus randomly allocate Group 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 7 . Subsequent vaccination visit ( Month 1 / Day 0 Month 2 / Day 0 visit ) Subsequent vaccination visit do accord schedule procedure . Physical examination perform . Any new medical issue symptom arisen assess . Blood collect parasite microscopy , haemoglobin biochemistry . Participants parasitaemia anaemia treat accord national guideline . Blood collect stored measurement antibody P. falciparum circumsporozoite ( anti-CS antibody ) shipment reference laboratory . Urine collect woman child-bearing age immediate pregnancy test . Before vaccination , on-going eligibility volunteer review . All participant attend clinic vaccination visit , observe closely least 30 minute follow administration study vaccine , receive paper diary card record solicit AEs , describe . Information record CRF subsequent vaccination visit .</detailed_description>
