	<brief_title>Bladder Tumor Biopsy Study Improve Preoperative Determination Stage Grade</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non-invasive bladder cancer challenge treat condition characterize frequent recurrence lead numerous invasive procedure detection treatment . The mainstay therapy non-muscle invasive bladder cancer , remain unchanged decade , relies surgical resection ( TUR ) associate utilization intravesical immunotherapy chemotherapy . Despite best effort , tumor continue suboptimal rate recurrence require long-term follow-up costly invasive procedure . The rationale study show preoperative biopsy , take time office cystoscopic evaluation , improve pre-TUR stag grade correlation final pathology resection . Indirectly , suggest routine use pre-TUR biopsy provide accurate information intraoperative decision-making ultimately lead well management patient non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer .</detailed_description>
