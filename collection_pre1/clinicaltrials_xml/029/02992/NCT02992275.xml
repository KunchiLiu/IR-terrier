	<brief_summary>This study examine addition neuromuscular electrical stimulation ( NMES ) hip abductor strength train fall prevention program improve muscle strength improve balance . All individual study receive NMES hip abductor participate fall reduction program .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>NMES Improve Hip Abductor Strength Balance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Falls lead cause disability old adult . Decreased low extremity muscle mass strength contribute balance mobility limitation . Our recent work also suggest addition traditional target muscle mass thigh leg muscle , dysfunction hip abductor may contribute balance mobility limitation result increased fall risk . Older adult impair hip abductor muscle demonstrate increase amount intramuscular fat ( IMAT ) around muscle , decrease hip abductor strength , low balance score , increase gait variability ( predictor future fall ) , poor step mechanic recover balance perturbation . Increased IMAT muscle dysfunction hip abductor may contribute poor hip abductor muscle recruitment make change muscle traditional intervention difficult . Neuromuscular electrical stimulation ( NMES ) one method improve muscle mass , strength quality old adult , traditionally use hip abductor . We propose targeted multimodality balance intervention ( MMBI ) focus lateral diagonal step hip abductor strengthen combine NMES result improvement mobility balance .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Mobility balance limitation demonstrate selfreported fall within past year require great 8 second complete 4square step test 1 . Cardiovascular Risks : Poorly control hypertension ( &gt; 160/100 ) ; patient report : symptomatic angina rest exercise , syncope without know resolution cause , significant coronary event ( MI ) past six month 2 . COPD require home oxygen 3 . Contraindications resistance training , include selfreported history intracranial retinal bleeding last year Diabetes active proliferative retinopathy 4 . Patient report significant spinal stenosis would limit participation exercise intervention 5 . Nonambulatory mobility status transtibial transfemoral amputation 6 . Dementia ( medical record review minimental status exam score &lt; 24 ) . 7 . Other severe medical illness condition would preclude safe participation study determine study team</criteria>
