	<brief_summary>The overall research aim pilot study determine structural brain protein calpain-cleaved αII-spectrin N-terminal fragment ( SNTF ) use blood biomarker accurately identify patient severe symptom reduce neurocognitive functioning sustain concussion . Concussion also refer mild traumatic brain injury ( mTBI ) literature . Both term use interchangeably throughout application .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The novel aspect propose study relate fact STNF protein first evidence biomarker human blood help clinician determine specific patient 's clinical outcome concussion . This turn help clinician concussion specialist design treatment protocol early initial injury could significant impact health patient . This study several important benefit scientific community . Concussion treatment today uncertain . Some patient back baseline one two day post injury whereas patient experience debilitate symptoms month injury . Until patient begin report symptom , course treatment determine . Other biomarkers concussion diagnosis evaluate , first biomarker show promise patient stratification earlier intervention treatment subset case high risk suffer brain damage persist dysfunction concussion . Currently , prognostic method exist identify early potentially treatable stage small subset concussion sufferer risk diffuse axonal injury persist brain functional impairment .</detailed_description>
