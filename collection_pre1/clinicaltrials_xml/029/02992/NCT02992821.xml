	<brief_summary>Among patient admit cerebral ischemia ( stroke transitory ischemic attack ( TIA ) ) important reveal underlying cause disease . In special important reveal carotid artery stenosis present find directly influence treatment follow-up . For diagnosis carotid artery stenosis due atherosclerosis ultrasound examination cornerstone , computer tomography magnetic resonance imaging may better case . Development high quality pocket-sized ultrasound scanner allow semi quantitatively bed-side assessment carotid artery heart . The investigator aim study feasibility reliability bed-side assessment carotid arteries pocket-sized ultrasound scanner inexperienced hand clinical influence examination perform experienced user . The investigator hypothesize significant proportion patient population clarify bed-side junior doctor need image procedure assessment carotid artery heart .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pocket Sized Carotid Stenosis Screening Junior Doctors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Population : Approximately 100 patient admit Department Medicine , Levanger Hospital Stroke Department , St. Olavs Hospital history finding suspicious stroke/transitory ischemic attack ( TIA ) . Informed consent mandatory . Exclusion criterion : CT angiography carotid vessel perform index event Hypotheses : The carotid artery assess bed-side pocket-size ultrasound scanner high feasibility reliability junior doctor limit training . Bed-side assessment carotid arteries pocket-size ultrasound scanner may reduce need advance ( high cost ) imaging procedure . New high frame rate track doppler increase accuracy reproducability stenosis grading . Methods : Pocket-size imaging device GE Ultrasound , commercial available . Approved clinical use . High-end carotid Doppler ultrasound high-end equipment ( GE Vivid 9 ) computer tomography magnetic resonance imaging Department Radiology , Levanger Hospital St. Olavs Hospital Verasonics research scanner high fram rate imaging</detailed_description>
