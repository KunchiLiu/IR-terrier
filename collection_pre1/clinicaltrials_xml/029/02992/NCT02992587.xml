	<brief_summary>Background : Over past decade see increase life expectancy Denmark . One consequences patient need heart surgery high average age patient fragile physique increase risk major surgery . In cardiac surgery , different type score system assess preoperative risk death associate surgery . Among EuroSCORE STS system use . This study evaluate preoperative risk use frailty score system , CAF ( comprehensive assessment frailty ) , base assessment patient 's physical condition . If patient low expect physical condition , patient frail . The assessment physical condition generate question patient 's medical history physical activity well perform less physical test , consist strength , balance walk speed . Purpose : A prospective observational study , investigate many patient must undergo heart surgery , frail . Then compare patient frail non-frail patient term complication , mortality quality life procedure . By use CAF score patient score frail non-frail . There plan study compare degree kidney injury frail non-frail patient . Our assumption patient frail , increased risk complication longer hospital stay , high consumption intensive day readmission . Using frailty score combination exist score system EuroSCORE STS score , believe well predictor complication follow heart surgery . Method : FICS study prospective observational study patient undergo cardiac surgery cardiothoracic department Rigshospitalet . Planned enroll 600 patient two year period . The study consist various small physical test question . Which use ass whether patient frail frail . Postoperatively follow-up 30 day phone call 12 month danish data register . At follow-up time , data collect somatic readmission / diagnosis vital status national register review relevant journal note . Afterwards compare complication mortality . Who enter : One patient include follow criterion meet : Age &gt; 65 year , Elective subacute surgery , CABG ( coronary artery bypass grafting ) , valve substitution combination If one follow criterion meet , patient include study : Acute surgery , Clinical unstable , Severe neuropsychiatric impairment , Uncooperative ( psychiatric diagnosis ) Re-operations . Side effect , risk disadvantage : Today preoperative risk assessment assess EuroSCORE . Introduction CAF , frailty score expose patient risk side effect , since course treatment change . Economy : There consider study economically justify , since hypothetically would lead few readmission , few day intensive care shorter hospital . Acquisition : The patient trial 65 year old must complete elective subacute cardiac surgery . They receive participant information thus opportunity read study first appearance . At first appearance meet project assistant get verbal information study , also question answer . Subsequently , patient ask sign consent form . Publication test result / research ethic statement : The knowledge result obtain survey provide essential scientific information significance future course treatment patient undergoing cardiac surgery regard number hospital day , intensive day readmission .

	<detailed_description>Background : In general , patient refer cardiac surgery age . An increase number patient older 70 year . [ 1 ] This old population patient undergoing cardiac surgery often several comorbidities increase risk complication mortality compare young patient . [ 1,2 ] Furthermore , several study show elderly patient cardiovascular disease may frail . Frailty term use assess true biological status patient define patient 's impaired resistance stressor due decline physiologic reserve . [ 3-8 ] In cardiac surgery several risk score ass 30-day mortality exists . The common European system cardiac operative risk evaluation ( EuroSCORE ) I , EuroSCORE II Society Thoracic Surgeons ( STS ) score . However , EuroSCORE seem tendency overestimate perioperative risk elderly population opposite STS score tendency underestimate risk . One reason may none risk score incorporate biological status patient . [ 9-11 ] Within last 5 year study evaluate different 'frailty score ' cardiac patient publish . [ 3-6,8,12-16 ] None frailty risk score fully validate therefore widely adopt . In German single center study 400 patient undergoing elective cardiac surgery age 74 frailty assess comprehensive assessment frailty ( CAF ) score . The CAF score assess weakness , self-reported exhaustion , slowness gait speed , low activity physical performance . [ 14,15 ] The CAF score correlate well EuroSCORE STS score , complex time consume risk score . In effort make test clinical practical simpler version CAF score develop . The 'frailty predict death one year elective cardiac surgery test ' ( FORECAST ) include ; chair rise , self-reported weakness , stair climb , two physician estimation frailty serum creatinine level . [ 14,17 ] Aim : In observational prospective study , identify describe number frail patient undergo first time cardiac surgery department , compare risk short-term long-term complication compare quality life frail versus non-frail patient . Frailty assess CAF score . In substudy analyze risk renal insufficiency . Hypothesis : Patients deem frail use CAF score increase risk short-term long-term complication . With frailty score addition EuroSCORE STS score , good predict complication compare EuroSCORE STS score alone . Method : A ) Patients/study population : FICS study prospective observational study elderly patient undergo cardiac surgery Department Cardiothoracic Surgery , Rigshospitalet , Copenhagen University Hospital , Denmark . Expect include 600 patient two year inclusion period . With minimum 12 month inclusion period , include analysis , maximum follow-up time . B ) Inclusion criterion : 1 . All patient age 65 year old 2 . Patients refer elective subacute cardiac surgery 3 . All undergoing CABG ( coronary artery bypass grafting ) , valve replacement CABG valve replacement . C ) Exclusions criterion : 1 . Emergent surgery 2 . Clinically unstable 3 . Severe neuropsychiatric impairment 4 . No cooperation ( psychiatric diagnosis ) . 5 . Reoperations D ) Follow-up : Patients follow discharge search The Danish National Registry , contain information somatic hospital admission . From collect copy patient record hospital admission . Patient record assess pour predefined outcome measure . Information vital status achieve search Danish Central Civil Register . The cause death obtain patient record death certificate . After 30 day contact patient phone ask quality life intake/changes medicine follow Danish Central Civil Register 12 month . E ) Substudies : Study 1 , Short-term follow-up : This study describe proportion frail patient department undergo cardiac surgery . We compare number complication two group . 30-day follow-up comparing frail v non-frail patient undergo cardiac surgery : Primary outcome : In study primary outcome 30-day all-cause mortality frail vs. non-frail patient ( hospital mortality death within 30 day postoperatively ) . Secondary outcome : MACCE ( Major Adverse Cardiac Cerebrovascular Events ) include : - AMI - Stroke - Mortality Tertiary outcome : - Stroke - Renal failure discharge : - Prolonged ventilation ( &gt; 24 h ) - Days intensive care unit ( ICU ) - Readmission ICU - Deep sternal wound infection ( need operative intervention antibiotic therapy , positive culture ) - Need reoperation ( major bleeding ) - Perioperative complication ex gastrointestinal complication ( ischemia , gastric ulcer ) - Days hospitalization - Discharged hospital nursing home ongoing medication rehabilitation many day discharge home Study 2 , Long-term follow-up : This study follow , last one include follow minimum 12 month . And first one include follow last recruited . 12 month follow-up frail v non-frail patient undergo cardiac surgery : Primary outcome : In study primary outcome all-cause mortality 12 month frail vs. non-frail patient . Secondary outcome : MACCE ( Major Adverse Cardiac Cerebrovascular Events ) include : - AMI : - Stroke - Mortality Tertiary outcome : - Discharged hospital nursing home ongoing medication rehabilitation many day discharge home - Prolonged hospitalization ( &gt; 14 day ) - Number Re-hospitalization - New diagnosis medication ( change new ) - Social support ( need help , care tool ) - Other complication . Study 3 , Predicting postoperative Acute Kidney Injury ( AKI ) frail vs. non-frail patient undergo cardiac surgery : AKS major complication cardiac surgery associate increased mortality morbidity . It proven know patient renal reserve surgery important , predict mortality AKI outcomes . Since early detection patient may contribute improve outcome . Estimation renal reserve Serum creatinine , eGFR , Serum cystatin C , Urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin ( NGAL ) , Cr EDTA Clearance 24 hr . collection urine determine Cr Clearance , protein albumin . This sample collecte preoperative day , postoperativly day 5 3 follow-up 3 month postoperativley . Primary outcome : In study primary outcome development AKI severity AKI frail vs. non-frail patient , define one following : - Diuresis &lt; 0,5ml/kg/hr . &gt; 6 consecutive hour - Serum creatinine raise &gt; 26umol/L within 48 hour - serum creatinine rise &gt; 1,5 fold reference value ( low value record within 3 month ) Secondary outcome : - Persistent AKI : Having AKI 48 hour longer . Study 4 , To examine correlation frailty score two commonly use surgical risk score , EuroSCORE STS performance characteristic patient age 65 undergoing cardiac surgery . This study compare commonly use risk estimation system patient undergo cardio-surgical procedure , STS north America EuroSCORE Europe frailty score CAF FORECAST estimation mortality morbidity 30 day 12 month mortality . F ) The Frailty score scale : CAF : Evaluation frailty use comprehensive assessment frailty ( CAF ) score scale S. Sündermann . [ 14 ] [ 15 ] This base combination different score scale . The first part base Fried criterion : weight loss , self-reported exhaustion , low activity , slowness gait speed weakness . Where CAF include except weight loss . Self-reported exhaustion two question original CES-D scale , Center epidemiological study Depression . Low activity ask instrumental activity daily living ( IADL ) . The IADL use , walk , housework , outdoor activity , regular sport others . Following kilocalorie per week calculate formula : Kilo Cal= ( w x frequency activity x duration activity ) /2 . Slowness , speed meter per second , patient walk 4 meter normal walk speed weakness grip strength pull strong grasp dynamometer kilogram ( kg ) . The second part physical performance test . Testing balance , long stand still foot together , one foot halfway front ( semi-tandem ) one foot completely front one ( tandem ) . At position time measure put frailty table score point . In last element balance patient ask turn around 360 degree time obtain . Then test body control , get chair three time , put remove jacket pick pen floor . The last part Laboratory test , include level serum albumin , Creatinine calculate Forced expiratory volume 1 ( FEV1 ) . At end two physician , different person observe CAF test ( one cardiac surgeon one experienced clinician ) estimate patient frailty Clinical frailty scale score . The Clinical frailty scale Canadian Study Health Aging , Which base frailty index compose 70 item , estimate frailty scale 1-7 . 1 . Very fit : robust , active , energetic , well motivated fit ; people commonly exercise regularly fit group age . 2 . Well : without active disease , less fit people category 1 . 3 . Well , treat comorbid disease : disease symptom well control compare category 4 . 4 . Apparently vulnerable : although frankly dependent , people commonly complain `` slow '' disease symptom . 5 . Mildly frail : limited dependence others instrumental activity daily live . 6 . Moderately frail : help need instrumental non- instrumental activity daily live . 7 . Severely frail : completely dependent others activity daily live , terminally ill . Finally get patient total CAF score , add individual test score together . It maximum score 35 point . That divide frail 1-10 , moderately frail 11-25 severely frail 26-35 . Out CAF score , ability score use FORECAST ( Frailty predict death One year elective cardiac surgery test ) include 5 CAF item : chair rise , weakness , stair climb , CFS ( clinical frailty scale ) Serum creatinine . FORECAST maximum score 14 point , also divide , frail 0-4 , moderately frail 5-7 severely frail 8-14 . [ 17 ] Statistics : Sample size calculation . Based CAF frailty score patient categorize non-frail group ( CAF score &lt; 11 ) frail group ( CAF score 11 ) . In previous study Sündermann et al . find 50 % patient 75 year undergo first time CABG deem frail use CAF score . Furthermore , observe 1 year mortality 7 % non-frail group versus 14 % frail-group [ 17 ] . Based power 80 % risk type I error 5 % mortality report give inclusion least 300 patient group . Data analysis Categorical data present number percentage compare use chi square test Fischer exact test , appropriate . Continuous data describe mean correspond standard deviation ( SD ) compare use student t-test . Time event primary secondary outcome analyze use Cox regression model . Survival curve illustrate Kaplan-Meier plot . A P-value le 0.05 consider significant . Administration : The preoperative testing frailty take place Department Cardiothoracic Surgery Rigshospitalet , Copenhagen University Hospital , Denmark . Economy : This non-profit study . The expense cover involve department Rigshospitalet . The department cardiothoracic surgery cover cost project nurse inclusion period . Ethics : Today department use EuroSCORE risk score preoperative . The use frailty score use department cardiology last year . Admission frailty score department humanly justify since patient take risk side effect . We find financially responsible introduce , hypothetical expect lead few readmission , few ICU day hospitalization day .
