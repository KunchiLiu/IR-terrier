	<brief_title>Preoperative Chemoradiotherapy With Raltitrexed Intermediate Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer Fit Elderly</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The concurrent chemoradiotherapy become standard treatment patient intermediate locally advanced rectal cancer . However , data prospective trial elderly patient still lack . The aim multicenter phase II study evaluate response rate , local control , disease-free survival treatment-related toxicity preoperative chemoradiation Raltitrexed intermediate locally advanced rectal cancer fit elderly age 70 year . And participant evaluate comprehensive geriatric assessment ( CGA ) . Clinical stage evaluate chest abdominal compute tomography , endorectal ultrasound , and/or pelvic magnetic resonance imaging . 5 week preCRT , multi-disciplinary team decide follow treatment patient base imaging evaluation . Surgical resection would do minimum interval 6 week last radiation . Acute toxicity evaluate within 2 week CRT . Toxicities assess accord National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events , version 4.0 . Sample size consideration.It calculate 68 patient need include , accord follow assumption : Recruitment period 24 month . Minimum follow-up period 24 month . We estimate 51 patient required test hypothesis 2-year DFS equal great 78 % 80 % power reject hypothesis 2-year DFS rate le 63 % significance level 5 % ( one side ) .Taking account 5 % percentage loss , 20 % patient refuse surgery , 68 patient expect include study . The intermediate analysis design . An intermediate safety evaluation carry 39 patient finish preoperative CRT . We estimate 39 patient required test hypothesis G3 high acute toxicity rate equal le 21 % 80 % power reject hypothesis G3 high toxicity rate 36 % significance level 10 % ( one side ) . Biospecimen Retention . Blood , plasma , feces tissue ( optional ) . Feces collect treatment . Peripheral blood sample 10-20mL collect patient CTCs analysis , exploration analysis frailty tumor marker preCRT , surgery , follow visit , accord study protocal .</detailed_description>
