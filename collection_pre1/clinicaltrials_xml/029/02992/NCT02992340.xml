	<brief_summary>.The study intend evaluate objective patient advance metastatic biliary tract cancer receive systemic therapy advanced/metastatic disease . Primary Objectives : Phase 1B • To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) , determine dose-limiting toxicity ( DLTs ) , characterise safety profile Varlitinib combination Gemcitabine Cisplatin . Phase 2 • To access efficacy Varlitinib combination Gemcitabine Cisplatin term objective response rate ( ORR ) 24 week ( ORR base RECIST v1.1 ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Varlitinib Combination With Gemcitabine Cisplatin Treatment naïve Advanced Metastatic BTC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In phase 1B part , patient receive Varlitinib plus Gemcitabine Cisplatin , follow modify 3+3 study dose escalation scheme start Varlitinib 200 mg BID . The primary objective phase 1B part determine MTD Varlitinib give combination Gemcitabine Cisplatin , characterise safety profile study treatment regimen . Based determined MTD clinical information obtain phase 1B part study , DSMB review safety data , together sponsor , determine MTD well recommend dose phase 2 . The sponsor make decision proceed phase 2 part study . The phase 2 part two-arm , double-blinded , placebo control study . Patients randomise 2 arm receive Varlitinib plus Gemcitabine Cisplatin , placebo plus Gemcitabine Cisplatin . The primary objective phase 2 part objective response rate ( ORR ) . Patient screen activity include informed consent study eligibility verification perform within 21 day prior first dose study medication . Radiological image assess disease status perform baseline every 6 week disease progression evaluate efficacy treatment . Blood sample take screen phase , every week first cycle every cycle end treatment . Patients require complete safety follow-up within 28 day last administration study medication .</detailed_description>
