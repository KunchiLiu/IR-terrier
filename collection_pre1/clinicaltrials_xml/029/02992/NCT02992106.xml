	<brief_summary>The rise worldwide prevalence obesity subsequently rise incidence concommitant diseases diabetes cardiovascular event impose defiant obstacle health care associate health care cost future generation . Obese pregnant woman grow population interest offspring risk childhood obesity , adverse metabolic inflammatory profile possible endothelial dysfunction . However , strong evidence still lack regard hypothesis early origin long-term health consequence . Consequently comprehensive data available contribution change maternal weight lifestyle intervention bariatric surgery eventual adverse metabolic endothelial programming offspring . The investigator study want provide additional data body composition , metabolic inflammatory state well endothelial function child obese pregnant woman woman compare outcome child bear normal weight woman . Furthermore , investigator study stratify obese pregnant woman 3 group : woman underwent intervention , woman underwent weight change intervention pregnancy e.g . diet lifestyle intervention woman underwent bariatric surgery pregnancy . The overall aim study prove diverse group participate child , except control group , certain grade endothelial dysfunction , even normalization weight , insulin sensitivity inflammation conception delivery mother .</brief_summary>
