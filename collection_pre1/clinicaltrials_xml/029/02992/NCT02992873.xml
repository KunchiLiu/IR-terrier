	<brief_summary>Sudden cardiac death major health problem western world . In Europe alone nearly 300 000 patient affect annually . The majority victim suffer Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest ( OHCA initial cardiac rhythm treat mean defibrillation . In emergency medical system ( EMS ) time defibrillation long survival average 10 % .However , layman operate Automated External Defibrillators ( AEDs ) use within first minute , 7 10 may survive . The aim `` The Scandinavian AED Mobile Bystander Activation '' ( SAMBA ) trial evaluate Mobile Phone Positioning system smartphone application increase proportion patient attach Automated External Defibrillator ( AED ) arrival Emergence Medical System ( EMS ) . Mobile phone technology smartphone application use identify recruit nearby CPR-trained lay people automate external defibrillator ( AEDs ) patient suffer out-of-hospital cardiac arrest ( OHCA ) . The system currently run Stockholm Sweden Gothenburg region .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Early defibrillation out-of-hospital cardiac arrest associate high survival rate . If operator dispatch center suspect out-of-hospital cardiac arrest activate mobile position system ( MPS ) wich integrate operator computer environment . After activation , system locate CPR-trained volunteer nearby suspect OHCA . By computer base 1:1 randomization lay volunteer alert dispatched 50 % suspect OHCAs system trigger dispatcher . In intervention group , activation system suppose result lay volunteer alert directed fetch near AED commence early defibrillation . Dependent geographical logistical circumstance , minimum one lay volunteer alert provide bystander CPR . In control group MPS activate lay responder dispatch suspected OHCA perform CPR . In group ordinary EMS service dispatch regular fashion .</detailed_description>
