	<brief_summary>Postmastectomy radiotherapy ( PMRT ) unequivocally beneficial reducing recurrence well improve survival node positive breast cancer patient . PMRT woman T1-T2 tumor negative axillary node generally warrant presumed low risk recurrence population whole . However , set multiple adverse prognostic factor , recurrence risk approach case surpasses risk recurrence document patient one three positive lymph node . Numerous retrospective series report outcome pattern failure post-mastectomy patient treat without radiation . Many series analyze several high risk factor predictive loco-regional recurrence wherein role adjuvant post-mastectomy radiation consider . Some author use combination prognostic factor , age , tumour size , grade , receptor status , Her2neu status lympho-vascular space invasion define subgroup specific risk loco-regional recurrence single factor alone . The current trial hypothesize `` Post-mastectomy radiation high risk , node negative early breast cancer patient decrease rate loco-regional recurrence improve disease free survival '' propose address question randomize setting .</brief_summary>
