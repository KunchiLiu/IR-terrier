	<brief_summary>Breast cancer lead cancer diagnose woman second cause cancer death . Of racial/ethnic group US , Black woman high rate breast cancer death . Two-thirds Black breast cancer patient estrogen receptor ( ER ) positive tumor treat adjuvant hormonal therapy . If take full five year , therapy show reduce mortality 50 % . However , ER positive Black woman likely die breast cancer ER positive White woman . Preliminary data suggest non-adherence adjuvant hormonal therapy could explain disparity . To date , study systematically examine psychosocial , healthcare , biological factor predict adherence hormonal therapy Black woman breast cancer . To begin fill knowledge gap , Investigators conduct prospective cohort study 422 ER positive Black breast cancer patient recruit health maintenance organization ( HMOs ) . Our primary outcome adherence therapy 36 month post initiation . Specific aim : 1 ) Examine psychosocial factor ( e.g . health belief , socio-cultural value , etc . ) predict adherence hormonal therapy ; 2 ) Identify clinical ( e.g. , side effect ) , biological ( e.g. , stage , etc . ) factor predict adherence hormonal therapy ; 3 ) Evaluate healthcare variable ( e.g. , communication , management side effect , etc . ) predict adherence . Investigators also explore role CYP2D6 genetic variation adherence hormonal therapy novel increase knowledge genetic factor Blacks . The study focus time-period ( first 3 year ) woman appear vulnerable terminate treatment prematurely . A good understanding predictor adherence Black woman may help target intervention ultimately improve potentially avoidable adverse breast cancer outcomes underserved group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Investigators employ Adherence Model Behavior identify clinical , psychosocial , healthcare delivery predictor longitudinal hormonal therapy adherence woman HR positive breast cancer . This study significant : ( 1 ) breast cancer Blacks Whites HR positive ( ~75 % ) 1,27 ; ( 2 ) hormonal therapy recommend woman HR positive cancer since reduces recurrence mortality ; ( 3 ) woman adhere hormonal therapy lower mortality not28 ; ( 4 ) adherence hormonal therapy suboptimal , even HMO setting ; ( 5 ) current guideline recommend least 5 year hormonal therapy6 ; ( 6 ) along Whites , investigator examine adherence behavior Blacks , group report poor outcome Whites , even among HR positive case similar stage ; ) past study document poor adherence systematically examine reason non-adherence . Overall , result clinically useful inform intervention pharmacogenetics research . For instance , investigator find communication strongly influence adherence , investigator develop implement patient self-efficacy physician reminder-based intervention enhance communication adherence patient clinicians HMOs . If investigator find different factor predict adherence Blacks versus Whites , investigator develop tailored intervention . The PI extensive experience develop tailored intervention improve communication uptake chemotherapy Blacks Latinas.The next section highlight background support significance research .</detailed_description>
