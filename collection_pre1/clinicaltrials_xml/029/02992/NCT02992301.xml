	<brief_summary>Aim 1 : To determine whether therapy Alirocumab , compare pre-treatment , effectively improve carotid atherosclerotic plaque characteristic reduce Ktrans LRNC size . To achieve goal , ( ) enroll 30 subject intolerant high intensity statin therapy able tolerate low potency statin low weekly dose high potency statin LDL-C ≥100 mg/dl ; ( b ) initiate alirocumab 150mg subcutaneously injection every 2 week ; ( c ) perform carotid DCE-MRI scan baseline , 3 , 6 12 month ; ( ) perform quantitative analysis vascular inflammation plaque LRNC volume plaque characteristic ; ( e ) compare vascular inflammation LRNC volume pre- post-alirocumab 3 , 6 12 month . Aim 2 : To examine association reduction atherogenic lipid ( LDL-C , Lp ( ) , non-HDL-C ) change atherosclerotic plaque characteristic . To achieve goal , ( ) perform laboratory assessment lipid , lipoproteins apo-lipoproteins baseline study ; ( b ) compare lipid , lipoproteins apo-lipoproteins level pre- post-alirocumab ; ( c ) correlate reduction atherogenic lipid change atherosclerotic plaque characteristic .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Acute ischemic event cause atherosclerosis cardiovascular disease ( ASCVD ) primarily due plaque rupture/erosion determine plaque morphologic characteristic , local composition inflammation , directly assess use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . Prospective carotid MRI study demonstrate : ( 1 ) plaque thin ruptured cap , intraplaque hemorrhage ( IPH ) , neovascularization , large lipid-rich necrotic core ( LRNC ) strongly associate occurrence cerebrovascular coronary event , ( 2 ) increase LRNC size significantly associate increase risk systemic ASCVD event adjust LDL-C Non-HDL-C level , ( 3 ) increase permeability adventitial vas vasorum associate presence IPH increase plaque burden LRNC progression appear resistant conventional dos statin , ( 4 ) intensive lipid therapy decrease carotid LRNC vascular inflammation , ( 5 ) multicenter carotid study conduct good reproducibility feasibility . Unlike previous clinical trial evaluate carotid artery disease use ultrasound base technology show weak relationship systemic coronary vascular event , recent study demonstrate predictive value carotid plaque tissue characteristic subsequent systemic ASCVD event include coronary event . Hellings colleague find carotid plaque composition histology 818 patient underwent endarterectomy independent predictor future cardiovascular event long-term post-operative follow-up . Specifically , carotid IPH increase neovascularization significantly high risk ASCVD event . The Atherosclerosis Risk Communities study investigator report carotid LRNC ( HR=1.9 , p=0.014 ) minimum cap thickness ( HR=0.67 , p=0.03 ) , identify MRI , significantly associate development ASCVD include coronary event adjust clinical risk factor , treatment variable biomarkers . The carotid MRI sub-study AIM-HIGH show high Lp ( ) level associate high-risk plaque feature prevalent subject establish vascular disease `` well-controlled '' LDL-C blood pressure . Thin rupture cap large LRNC predictive systemic ASCVD event include 83 % ( 15/18 ) coronary event AIM-HIGH , meanwhile , none clinical risk factor lipids predictive future event . Alirocumab show substantial lower LDL-C , non-HDL-C Lp ( ) , without concomitant statin treatment [ 43 ] . It potential therapy improve plaque characteristic lead reduction ASCVD event . We propose conduct carotid MRI pilot study demonstrate add alirocumab 12 month , comparison pre-alirocumab therapy , 30 subject document carotid artery plaque able tolerate high intensity statin therapy LDL-C ≥100 mg/dl would improve atherosclerotic plaque characteristic reduce Ktrans LRNC size .</detailed_description>
