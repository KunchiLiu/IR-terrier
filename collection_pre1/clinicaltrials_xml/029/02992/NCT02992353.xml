	<detailed_description>Introduction : In china , incidence death rate lung cancer 48.32 per 100 000 person-years 39.27 per 100 000 person-years , respectively , high malignant tumor . Surgical operation still main treatment mean resectable NSCLC . VATS pulmonary resection perform clinical operation aim decrease postoperative complication morbidity . The mechanism may due minimize inflammation reaction surgical injury . There trial regard two-port VATS versus three-port VATS versus four-port VATS single-port VATS versus three-port VATS . However , prospective randomise controlled trial regard Single-port versus two-port versus three-port video assist thoracoscopic pulmonary resection NSCLC . So , hope demonstrate single-port two-port VATS feasible safe trial , hope result study provide high level clinical evidence choose best operative approach VATS . Methods analysis : three year prospective randomise controlled trial , aim attest safety feasibility simple-port VATS two-port VATS . Group A , B C receive single-port VATS , two-port VATS three-port VATS pulmonary resection respectively . The primary endpoint postoperative recurrence rate . The secondary endpoint include postoperative complication morbidity , number location lymph node dissected、operation time , intraoperative volume blood loss , hospital stay , hospitalization expense , quantity use antalgica , change pulmonary function . 70 patient enrolled per group three year , add 10 % loss sample , 77 patient require group total 231 patient enrol study end .</detailed_description>
