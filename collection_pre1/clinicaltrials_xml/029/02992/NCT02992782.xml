	<brief_summary>Women undergone breast cancer surgery may develop swell arm side breast cancer occur . If swell become chronic call lymphedema . This study examine effect 12-week decongestive progressive resistance exercise advance compression breast cancer relate lymphedema . Our objective determine breast cancer survivor willing able wear advanced compression exercise combination help reduce lymphedema . Twenty-four breast cancer survivor Edmonton , Alberta enrol one-year long study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Decongestive Exercise Compression Breast Cancer Related Lymphedema Management</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lymphedema swell arm , chest wall breast side breast cancer . Arm lymphedema develop result breast cancer surgery and/ radiation therapy . Compression therapy exercise commonly prescribe treatment help reduce arm swell maintain result . The exercise usually prescribe lymphedema call decongestive remedial exercise . It involve active , non-resisted movement follow specific order proximal distal back proximally . The exercise start neck , move chest wall arm , back . Two different type compression garment propose help reduce swell woman exercise . One compression garment make stiffer , less elastic type material call `` flat-knit '' garment . The garment , `` Adjustable Compression Wrap '' garment adjustable elastic strapping system help reinforce compression arm . Recent research suggest specialize garment enhance muscle pump effect lymph flow ; however , research conduct test whether actually result improvement arm lymphedema volume . Resistance exercise training help improve arm flexibility , strength , function , quality life breast cancer survivor . Recent evidence show breast cancer survivor lymphedema , safely perform resistance training ( strength training ) , however , impact ( good worse ) arm lymphedema volume . To date , study perform combine potential therapeutic approach lymphedema management : resistance exercise , therapeutic decongestive exercise sequence , compression therapy . Women experimental arm study wear compression garment perform progressive resistance exercise follow decongestive sequence . We examine effect combine intervention arm lymphedema volume , function quality life .</detailed_description>
