	<detailed_description>This single-centre , randomise , open label Phase I clinical trial CD19 Chimeric Antigen Receptor ( CAR ) T-cells ( CD19 CAR T-cells ) patient chemotherapy-resistant refractory CD19+ B cell lymphoma . Following informed consent registration trial , Patients receive allogeneic CD19 CAR T-cells follow lymphodepleting chemotherapy . The study evaluate safety , efficacy duration response CD19 CAR T-cells patient chemotherapy-resistant refractory CD19+ B cell lymphoma .</detailed_description>
