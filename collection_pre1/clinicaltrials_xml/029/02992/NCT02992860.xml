	<detailed_description>Myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) comprise heterogeneous group hematologic malignancy pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell characterize clonal hematopoiesis progressive bone marrow failure . Clinically , patient suffer fatigue high risk infection bleed . Also , MDS patient endanger progression secondary acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) , disorder early hematopoietic progenitor cell characterise clonal expansion myeloid blast peripheral blood , bone marrow , and/or tissue . Up , allogeneic transplantation consider curative option MDS AML patient . However , MDS AML mainly manifest 7th 8th decade life , limited number patient tolerate bone marrow transplantation therefore eligible procedure . In fact , comorbid condition common among elderly heart disease , renal insufficiency vascular disease thus influence ability withstand exhaust transplantation procedure . Hence recent year , novel therapeutic strategy develop hypomethylating agent ( HMAs ) azacitidine decitabine emerge new therapeutic option . In 2009 , azacitidine first HMA use receive approval treatment MDS AML patient 20-30 % blast . In 2012 , also sister compound decitabine get approval treatment AML patient ≥ 65 year age 2015 , azacitidine 's approval extend AML patient ≥ 65 year age consider unfit allogeneic transplantation &gt; 30 % blast . However , despite efficacy report activity , 50 % patient respond treatment HMAs majority relapse . Also outcome HMA- refractory patient dismal median survival 5 month failure hence MDS AML patient HMA failure represent significant unmet medical need due poor prognosis limit treatment option . In context , specific target leukemic stem cell ( LSC ) seem promising option selectively combat leukemic cell . In fact , CD123 ( also know interleukin-3-Rα ) express different hematological malignancy , among others MDS AML . Interestingly , CD123 express majority AML blast also overexpressed CD34+ CD38- LSCs compare normal hematopoietic stem cell normal tissue . These feature make CD123 attractive target anti-leukemia therapy . Recent data suggest treatment HMA induce expression CD123 AML tumor open potential HMA failure patient may even high expression level CD123 . Indeed , JNJ-56022473 promise compound engineer regard strategy . JNJ-56022473 humanize monoclonal antibody target alpha chain interleukin-3-receptor optimized Fcγ region enhance activation antibody- dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity ( ADCC ) via natural killer cell . Recently , JNJ-56022473 evaluate phase I study AML patient high risk early relapse . There clear dose dependency depletion peripheral CD123 cell population pDC basophile complete sustain depletion see pt dos ≥3 mg/kg Given encourage result phase I trial propose phase II trial evaluate JNJ-56022473 AML patient well MDS patient fail refractory HMA- treatment . The clinical trial accompany translational research program aim elucidate specific immune response mediate JNJ-56022473 , particular descriptive functional analysis . In context bone marrow peripheral blood collect study well therapy . Constitutive overexpression α-subunit interleukin-3 receptor i.e . IL-3Rα , hallmark early AML progenitor cell population ( i.e . leukemic stem cell ) well leukemic blast IL-3Rα also overexpressed myelodysplastic syndrome . In fact , CD123 unique IL-3 receptor responsible high specificity low affinity bind IL-3 . Upon ligand binding , α-subunit CD123 associate βc-subunit ( CD131 ) form high-affinity receptor complex initiate intracellular signal cascade phosphorylation activation least 3 distinct signal transduction pathway : JAK/STAT-kinase , MAP-kinase- , PI3-kinase-pathways . Under physiological condition , activation IL-3 receptor induces proliferative , anti-apoptotic , differentiating signal . JNJ-56022473 ( CSL362 ) second generation antibody develop murine 7G3 anti- CD123 monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) stepwise process humanization , affinity maturation , Fc engineering . To enhance cytotoxicity first-generation antibody CSL360 , proprietary Xencor ( Xmab® ) technology apply two amino acid mutation ( S239D I332E ) introduce Fc region . These amino acid substitution lead improved binding CD16 ( FcγRIIIa ) natural killer ( NK ) cell significantly enhance ability induce ADCC . The JNJ-56022473 drug product use study produce different cell line different process compare CSL362 , drug product use phase I study CSLCT-AML-11-73 described . Comparability test JNJ-56022473 CSL362 show antibody behave similarly biophysical , biochemical , preclinical assessment . The primary structure , charge heterogeneity , size heterogeneity , purity , high order structure , process impurity find highly similar CSL362 JNJ56022473 . Pharmacodynamic ( PD ) study cynomolgus monkey show similar level biological activity CSL362 JNJ-56022473 ( ie , basophil pDC depletion ; NK cell number activity ) . Additionally , pharmacokinetic ( PK ) profile JNJ-56022473 follow 30 100 mg/kg IV dose cynomolgus monkey highly similar CSL362 . Following first weekly intravenous dose , mean Cmax AUC0-167h JNJ-56022473 91 % 94 % observed CSL362 , respectively . This open-label , single-arm , multicenter , phase II study JNJ-56022473 subject suffer MDS AML . The trial involve participate site Germany France . Up maximum 43 subject enrol study . JNJ-56022473 give intravenously subject dose 9 mg/kg every 14 day initial treatment period 3 month ( 6 infusion ) . Responders receive 20 additional infusion whereas non-responders initial treatment follow 9 month observation period without JNJ-56022473 treatment . Thus , individual study duration subject approx . 1 year . A follow visit perform 3 month last study drug administration patient track pregnancy status accord IB . For patient still benefit treatment graded responder time period define , treatment continue long medically indicate . End study whole 16 month LPFV ( maximum 26 treatment cycle plus follow three month ) . Data obtain end study ( EoS ) patient still respond report separate cover .</detailed_description>
