	<brief_summary>Respiratory failure newborn common high rate death . Where conventional intensive care strategy fail , newborn child refer treatment Extra- Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation ( ECMO ) . This involve connect child via large bore cannula place heart major blood vessel artificial lung add oxygen blood remove waste gas ( carbon dioxide ) . Although treatment save life , still limitation . In particular , severe complication like bleeding , damage kidney occur . These complication lead death case long-term disability others . Based ongoing research adult child undergo cardiac surgery investigator identify new process may underlie complication observe ECMO . The investigator note transfused blood infuse ECMO circuit , result accelerate release substance donor cell cause organ damage ; least adult . There treatment reverse process . Before investigator explore whether treatment use newborn child ECMO , investigator must first demonstrate measure complex inflammatory process occur critically ill child . The investigator therefore propose conduct feasibility study identify practical issue challenge would need overcome order perform successful trial high-risk population .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary hypothesis damage red blood cell exposure ECMO circuit result inflammatory response mitigate successful wean Extra-Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation ( ECMO ) Persistent Pulmonary Hypertension Newborn ( PPHN ) . The secondary hypothesis : 1 . Damage red cell result platelet , leukocyte endothelial activation . 2 . Markers platelet , endothelial leukocyte activation indicator lung inflammation injury severity hence lung recovery . 3 . Markers platelet , endothelial leukocyte activation indicator kidney injury severity hence acute kidney injury . 4 . The level oxidative stress correlate type shift pulmonary macrophage , tissue iron deposition organ injury . 5 . Ability raise anti-oxidative response , measure Heme Oxigenase-1 ( HMOX 1 ) expression , correlate short intubation time less severe kidney lung injury . 6 . Granulocyte platelets activation secondary rise redox potential level activation correlate long intubation time severe organ injury . 7 . Markers anti-oxidative response , platelet , endothelial leukocyte activation , well oxidative stress level diagnostic prognostic utility prediction key clinical event include delayed time recovery , acute kidney injury paediatric patient undergo Extra-Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation ( ECMO ) Persistent Pulmonary Hypertension Newborn ( PPHN ) . This pilot feasibility study establish following : 1 . Recruitment rate patient flow 24 patient specify target population feasibility study 2 . Withdrawal rate , completeness follow-up data collection paediatric population high risk death major morbidity 3 . The proportion ( categorical data ) variance ( continuous data ) primary secondary outcome interest . These use model sample size outcome may use definitive study 4 . Perceptions family member whose child participate study appropriateness screen consent process</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients diagnosis PPHN 2 . Patients require ECMO support determine ECMO team 3 . Patients age less 30 day 4 . Emergency consent obtain within 12 hour cannulation , ultimately full consent 1 . PPHN cause congenital heart pathology 2 . ECMO require congenital heart disease 3 . Lack consent</criteria>
