The subject fulfill prerequisite harmonic , stable occlusal relationship achieve oppose natural teeth resp . fix removable oppose dentition ( tooth implant base ) soft tissue bear denture . The subject willing able comply study related procedure ( exercise oral hygiene attend followup procedure ) . The subject compliant good oral hygiene . The subject edentulous mandible fail mandibular dentition provide sufficient bone interforaminal fix restoration three ( 3 ) implant regarded appropriate treatment solution . The subject osseous architecture enough receive three implant length least 11.5 mm diameter 5 mm interforaminal ( e.g . jaw volume B , C D ; inter foramina distance least 20 mm ; buccal/lingual width least 67 mm , vertical height level bone sufficient receive implant least 11.5 mm length ) . The subject jaw curvature fit prefabricate framework design . Implants place heal extraction site ( clinical stability ensure ) . The implant site free infection extraction remnant . The subject well implant site fulfill criterion early load . Smokers reduce consumption may include certain test phase ( e.g . test phase reduction 2 1 package cigarette least 6 month ) . Class II interjaw relation patient exclusion criterion per se . Based individual judgment clinician patient may treat . Subject inclusion criterion time surgery After bone leveling sufficient mandible bone volume interforaminal present three ( 3 ) implant length least 11.5 mm diameter 5 mm . After bone leveling jaw curvature fit prefabricate framework . The implant site free infection extraction remnant . The subject well implant site fulfill criterion early load . The subject able give her/his inform consent participate . Health condition , permit surgical ( include anesthesia ) restorative procedure . Reason believe treatment might negative effect subject 's overall situation ( psychiatric problem ) , note subject record history . Any disorder plan implant area previous tumor , chronic bone disease previous irradiation . Alcohol drug abuse note subject record subject history .
