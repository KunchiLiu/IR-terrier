Study Visits : On Day 1 Cycle 1 : You physical exam . Blood ( 2½ tablespoon ) draw genetic testing ; test hepatitis B C ( doctor think need ) ; pharmacodynamic ( PD ) test . PD test measure level study drug body may affect disease . Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw measure gene ( DNA , genetic material ) body may react pembrolizumab ; check status disease , check sign inflammation . You MRI CT scan . If become pregnant , part blood sample used pregnancy test . On Day 1 Cycles 2 beyond : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 1½ tablespoon ) draw routine test . If study doctor think need , sample also use check hepatitis B C. - At Cycle 2 , blood ( 1½ tablespoon ) draw PD test . - At Cycles 2 , 5 , 6 , blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw check status disease check sign inflammation . - If become pregnant , part blood sample used pregnancy test . On Day 1 Cycles 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , every 9 week , MRI CT scan . After 1 year , MRI CT scan every 12 week . On Day 1 even-numbered cycle ( Cycles 2 , 4 , 6 , ) , urine collect routine test . After receive study drug 6 week ( Cycle 2 ) , biopsy check status disease biomarker test . End-of- Study Visit : As soon possible last dose study drug : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 7 teaspoon ) draw routine test ; genetic PD testing ; check sign inflammation ; check status disease . - Urine collect routine test - You may CT scan MRI . - If become pregnant , part blood urine sample use pregnancy test . Follow-Up Visit : About 30-90 day last dose study drug : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 7 teaspoon ) draw routine test check status disease . If study doctor think need , sample also use check hepatitis B C. - Depending last scan perform , may CT scan MRI . - If become pregnant , part blood sample urine sample use pregnancy test . Long-Term Follow-Up : Every 9 week last dose study drug , MRI CT scan . If stop take study drug disease appear get bad wanted start new anti-cancer therapy , call study staff every 12 week ask . This call last 10-15 minute . This investigational study . Pembrolizumab FDA approve commercially available . It currently use research purpose . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 15 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
