	<brief_summary>Trauma one top threat population health globally . A substantial body research devote development clinical prediction model aid early decision make trauma care . Often model apply outside context originally develop . In contrast , little research focus effect model performance transfer despite fact potential loss performance could devastate consequence . Data Swedish trauma registry SweTrau use study effect model performance transfer different context within single conceptually homogenous set . Using logistic regression model predict all-cause mortality within 30 day trauma adult patient develop , focus systolic blood pressure , respiratory rate , Glasgow coma scale predictor . Four different set data sample SweTrau use simulate transfer model high low volume centre , metropolitan non-metropolitan centre , multicentre single centre data , finally individual centre . Measures overall performance , clinical usefulness , discrimination , calibration , recalibration use quantify effect performance model transfer . The study provide evidence help clinician policy maker decide whether appropriate apply model develop context . For example , result study may inform decision development implementation model intend applied national regional level , ultimately help design good trauma care improve outcome trauma patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Design Registry base study Setting data Data Swedish trauma registry SweTrau use . This quality registry , mean patient register continuously part care . They receive write information registration may opt withdraw data registry . The registry implement 2011 early 2016 30,000 entry . SweTrau include data Swedish university hospital non-university county hospital . The country approximately 50 university non-university county hospital receive trauma patient seven university hospital 60 % non-university county hospital contribute data SweTrau . There currently national classification hospital receive trauma patient Sweden . Previous research describe university hospital level I-II trauma centre , use classification American College Surgeons Committee Trauma guideline . Prehospital care transport provide ground air ambulance . The registry include patient prompt trauma team activation transfer trauma patient . Trauma team activation criterion vary across hospital generally two level trauma team activation , suspect major minor trauma respectively . The criterion base prehospital vital sign priori specify mechanism . Variables Predictors Systolic blood pressure ( mmHg ) , respiratory rate ( breath per minute ) Glasgow coma scale include predictor clinical prediction mode . All record arrival hospital . Other covariates The following variable use characterize patient cohort : age year , sex register male female , pre-injury comorbidity status accord American Society Anesthesiology ( ASA ) Physical Status classification , anatomical injury severity accord injury severity score ( ISS ) new injury severity score ( NISS ) , transfer hospital . Study size All participant SweTrau match eligibility criterion . Details sample size specific analysis step provide . Quantitative variable In model exercise quantitative variable , i.e . predictor , handle continuous . Both systolic blood pressure respiratory rate assume non-linearly associate mortality therefore model use restrict cubic spline four knot place equally spaced percentile , implement R rms package . Glasgow coma scale model linear term . Missing data strategy Multiple imputation use chained equation employ handle miss data , assume miss random ( MAR ) miss data mechanism . The R package mouse use . Predictive mean match impute quantitative variable logistic regression qualitative variable use appropriate . The number imputed datasets equal percentage miss data , round . Analysis plan The transfer model study use four different set data . Each set data simulate specific , plausible , situation model transfer different related context . In set data least two sample data drawn complete SweTrau database . High low volume centre To study transfer model high low volume centre data split two , use centre volume . High volume centre belong quartile centre large number patient register . Metropolitan non-metropolitan centre This set data also consist two sample , one patient Sweden 's metropolitan area Greater Stockholm , Greater Gothenburg Greater Malm√∂ define Statistics Sweden , one patient non-metropolitan area . The underlying assumption trauma mechanism differ metropolitan non-metropolitan area . Multi single centre data The data centre large enough effective sample size allow model development validation outline constitute sample . The multicentre data sample combine data centre . Individual centre To study transfer model individual centre set data consist sample centre large enough effective sample size allow model development validation outline . Statistical method R use statistical analysis , conduct follow sequence : model development , model validation , model comparison . A temporal split sample make base date trauma . The early part data henceforth refer development sample . The late part henceforth refer validation sample . The temporal split make development sample include 70 event , i.e . patient die within 30 day , non-events register time period . These 70 event correspond 10 event per free parameter prediction model , since systolic blood pressure respiratory rate model use three spline base Glasgow coma scale single term . The validation sample need include least 100 event non-events . Therefore , study transfer model multi single centre data individual centre , centre least 170 event include . 95 % confidence interval estimate predictive performance measure repeat analysis 1000 bootstrap sample draw replacement . Each imputed dataset bootstrapped separately analyse use standard technique multiple impute data . Development One model per development sample develop use logistic regression select main effect . To avoid overfitting model optimism shrinkage factor estimate use bootstrap approach . Model performance development sample evaluate use measure overall performance , discrimination , calibration , clinical usefulness outline section . Validation The model validate use linear predictor generate model development phase estimate probability 30 day mortality correspond validation sample . Validation perform estimate predictive performance measure model development phase . Comparison Models compare validation part sample . The performance model compare term overall performance , discrimination , calibration , clinical usefulness , reclassification , see . Predictive performance measure Overall performance assess use Brier score net benefit use measure clinical usefulness . Discrimination assess calculate area receiver operate characteristic curve ( AUROCC ) estimate specificity 95 % sensitivity . The 95 % sensitivity choose cutoff often quote indicative `` acceptable '' level undertriage , i.e . false negative ratio . To assess calibration sample first group use ten quantiles mortality probability estimate model interest . The mean mortality probability ( x ) proportion patient die group ( Y ) calculate . Finally , general linear model Y=A+B*x+e , use calibration intercept A slope B quantify calibration . To estimate reclassification model compare first use categorise patient belong one four risk group . The difference `` original '' grouping compare obtain use `` external '' model , i.e . reclassification , measure net reclassification improvement ( NRI ) .</detailed_description>
