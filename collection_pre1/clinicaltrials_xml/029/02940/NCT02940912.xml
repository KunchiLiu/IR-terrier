	<brief_title>Effect Continuous Apomorphine During Night Sleep Disorders Insomniac Patients With Parkinson 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sleep disorder common Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) . They present almost patient . They important impact quality life . To improve comfort patient , neurologist typically offer either dispersible form levodopa , prolong release dopaminergic agonists treatment deep brain stimulation surgery . Unfortunately treatment short-acting dispersible form levodopa always sufficient oral transdermal dopamine agonist heavy implement surgery . Some sleep disorder restless legs syndrome periodic leg movement , obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome , seem frequent PD patient general population could improve continuous dopaminergic treatment night . Finally , daytime sleepiness major problem PD patient . Although seem often link dopaminergic treatment give day , could also , patient result bad night 's sleep , lead rebound sleep day . The main objective demonstrate compare placebo , nocturnal continuous apomorphine treatment improve sleep quality assess patient PDSS-2 scale fluctuate parkinsonian patient complaint insomnia . The secondary objective measure effectiveness nocturnal continuous apomorphine sleep quality : total sleep time , sleep efficiency , arousal index , ventilatory event legs movement index , measure relative proportion sleep stage ( N1 , N2 , N3 , Rapid Eye Movement ou REM sleep ) , position change sleep index percentage time spend supine position , percentage time SpO2 &lt; 90 % ) , sleepiness ( Epworth Multiple Sleep Latency Test ) consequences quality life ( EuroQol 5 ) , depressive symptom ( Beck II ) , anxiety ( STAI ) , overall cognition ( MOCA ) , pain engine condition waking .</detailed_description>
