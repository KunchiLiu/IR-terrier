	<brief_summary>Insulin treatment type 1 diabetes inevitably carry risk hypoglycaemia ( low blood sugar ) severe enough cause coma , seizure , even death . Being unable feel blood glucose fall , condition call impaired awareness hypoglycaemia ( IAH ) , increase risk severe hypoglycaemia 6-fold . IAH reverse risk severe hypoglycaemia reduce people taught adjust insulin around life-style structured education problematic hypoglycaemia may persist . Many people apparently intractable IAH recurrent severe hypoglycaemia thought hypoglycaemia form barrier ability avoid hypoglycaemia . They benefit conventional treatment reduce hypoglycaemia . The investigator develop Hypoglycaemia Awareness Restoration Programme people type 1 diabetes problematic hypoglycaemia despite otherwise optimise self-care ( HARPdoc ) , novel intervention combine revision knowledge hypoglycaemia avoidance psychological therapy directly address unhelpful health belief hypoglycaemia . HARPdoc deliver six week , diabetes educator group 6 people . In pilot study , severe hypoglycaemia greatly reduce 23 people longstanding IAH recurrent severe hypoglycaemia . The investigator propose group-randomised controlled trial HARPdoc , compare establish educational intervention ( Blood Glucose Awareness Training , BGAT ) also show reduce severe hypoglycaemia . 96 people type 1 diabetes problematic hypoglycaemia persist despite otherwise optimise insulin self-management recruit group randomise receive either HARPdoc BGAT , 4 centre . The investigator measure severe hypoglycaemia two year follow course ; hypoglycaemia risk experience ; overall diabetes control quality life .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This group randomise trial HARPdoc , novel intervention adult type 1 diabetes ( T1DM ) treatment-resistant impaired awareness hypoglycaemia ( IAH ) severe hypoglycaemia ( SH ) , Blood Glucose Awareness Training ( BGAT ) , exist educational programme show reduce severe hypoglycaemia rate . The hypothesis HARPdoc , inclusion psychological therapy address cognitive barrier hypoglycaemia prevention , superior BGAT training reducing , maintain reduction , severe hypoglycaemia durably restore awareness hypoglycaemia adult type 1 diabetes whose problematic hypoglycaemia persist despite otherwise optimise diabetes self-management strategy . That optimise self-management define minimum attend structured education programme flexible intensive insulin therapy use principle minimum . HARPdoc BGAT `` talk therapy '' education plus , case HARPdoc , specific hypoglycaemia-focussed cognitive behavioural therapy ( CBT ) , deliver small group ( 4 8 participant time ) establish diabetes educator train support deliver intervention . Educators ( nurse dietitian ) train study clinical psychologist use exist curriculum , deliver EITHER HARPdoc OR BGAT . Educators deliver HARPdoc ( 2 per course ) , novel element hypoglycaemia specific cognitive behavioural therapy , also receive weekly supervision study clinical psychologist , delivery patient course . BGAT educator ( 1 per course ) able seek support ad hoc basis . Both BGAT HARPdoc course curriculum teach aid . Participants recruit , document hypoglycaemia experience period 12 month , randomly allocate group either receive HARPdoc BGAT . Follow two year plan analysis 12 month . Documentation SH monitor throughout use statistical process control control mapping , allow early termination study one intervention clearly outperform , assessed independent data monitoring committee . The study conduct diabetes outpatient facility clinical research facility participate centre . Potential participant invite usual diabetes care team consider study . Those express interest invite initial screen visit ( visit 1 ) , study explain person 's characteristic assess eligibility criterion . Those meeting criterion virtue impair awareness hypoglycaemia ( Gold Clarke score 4 ) ; severe hypoglycaemia previous 2 year despite complete , use principle , structure education flexible insulin either multiple daily insulin injection insulin pump therapy , monitor self-monitored blood glucose test day least four time day give opportunity review patient information literature consent , write , participation study . They receive unique study identification code commence formal documentation hypoglycaemia experience , use short form document event severe hypoglycaemia experience ( form A ) reporting retrospectively hypoglycaemia previous month ( form B ) . These form complete throughout study participant ask permission contact monthly basis miss data . Blood take measurement locally glycated haemoglobin , reflection diabetes control , potential contributor high hypoglycaemia risk ( liver , kidney thyroid function , measure adrenal pituitary function , screen coeliac disease malabsorption level anti-insulin antibody ) , data available patient record last year . The participant 's glucose meter download result precede two week record . Each participant offer two set date upcoming course , undertake one . Once two course fill , participant randomise receive either HARPdoc BGAT . A second visit ( baseline ) make 3 month participant 's course . Blood take central measurement HbA1c . Participants complete questionnaire booklet enquire attitude , worry behaviour around hypoglycaemia ( Attitudes Awareness ( A2A ) Hypoglycemia Fear Survey II ( HFS-11 ) score ) ; symptom anxiety depression ( Hospital Anxiety Depression score ( HADS ) Problem Areas Diabetes ( PAID ) ; quality life ( Diabetes Specific Quality Life ( DSQoL ) , Short Form 12 ( SF12 ) EuroQol five dimension questionnaire ( EQ5-D ) self-management skill ( Dose Adjustment Normal Eating ( DAFNE ) self-management ) . This booklet review approve user group . This visit may combine visit one consent already give . HARPdoc include 4 full day attendances 2 one-to-one contact participant educator , via telephone face-to-face patient chooses . In week 1-3 , participant meet weekly group . These full day session , current DAFNE Bournemouth Type 1 Diabetes Education Programme ( BERTIE ) course . They cover pathophysiology , presentation , detection treatment hypoglycaemia IAH ; use motivational interviewing support behaviour change encourage small change , Cognitive Behavioural Therapy ( CBT ) address unhelpful cognition may barriers hypoglycaemia avoidance . In week 4 5 , participant try new skills/strategies , two schedule individual face-to-face telephone educator support . Week 6 final group session , focus relapse prevention support significant others . The BGAT curriculum re-planned deliver 4 group session spread 6 week allow participant book inot course one time prior randomisation . The curriculum however extend occupy full day session . Sessions , participant permission , video tap , assessment fidelity course delivery curriculum . Attendance least first 3 group session plus , HARPdoc participants 1:1 session , consider adherence intervention/ control . Follow-up visit , 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 24 month , line clinical practice , recognize patient high service user . They last 2 hour conduct group . Participants contact detail ( telephone record answer next-working day reply ; e-mail address ) educator seek advice . Scheduled follow-up group re-inforcement programme principle data collection ( locally measure HbA1c , documentation hypoglycaemia experience awareness score ) 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 24 month . The 12 24 month visit include completion full questionnaire pack describe visit 2 . Additional non-study visit schedule required opinion participant and/or educator . Likewise , participant free seek advice educator time telephone e mail . Participants make aware form document hypoglycaemia experience month review anonymously need seek advice require , example , hypoglycaemia event , routine clinical practice . For visit one month window either side due date acceptable Twenty four participant ( 12 group ) , invited participate substudy wear real-time continuous glucose monitor one week baseline 12 month . A planned analysis compare outcomes two intervention plan participant complete 12 month follow-up , final analysis 2 year . Throughout data severe hypoglycaemia collect , blind course , Implementation Science group , enter control map , allow inspection rate severe hypoglycaemia individual patient intervention real time . These data review 6 monthly interval Data Monitoring Committee , ability interrupt RCT rate severe hypoglycaemia increase either group one intervention clearly superior . The described randomisation procedure prevent `` researcher bias '' researcher preferentially select high risk patient HARPdoc BGAT . To minimise contamination , different educator train deliver intervention . A safeguard contamination HARPdoc BGAT patient course curriculum drive unique element HARPdoc include BGAT curriculum . The fidelity delivery course monitor video-taped session . Recordings cod use check list behaviour change technique item relevant measure Behavioural Change Counselling Index ( BECCI ) Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity ( MITI ) scale . Participants wish withdraw trial remain service routinely collect primary end-point data ( severe hypoglycaemia rate , HbA1c , Gold score ) . Unless refuse permission , collect case-record data +/- 3 month due date . This allow u conduct intention-to-treat per protocol analysis . The target recruit 96 participant , 6 ( 4 - 8 ) participant per group course least 8 HARPdoc course 8 BGAT course ) , deliver 4 centre . The study target adult ( people age 18 ) type 1 diabetes IAH severe hypoglycaemia optimise medical therapy , may include , include , use insulin pump therapy and/or continuous glucose monitoring . This allow detection superiority HARPdoc BGAT 5 % significance level 90 % power , The power calculation base data pilot HARPdoc , publish data BGAT , look rate severe hypoglycaemia . Conservative estimate use , allow 2 episode per patient per year present study HARPdoc 5.7 episode per patient per year BGAT , allow 20 % drop . Participants identify study centre enhance referral neighbour diabetes centre pathways place follow people type 1 diabetes make use emergency service severe hypoglycaemia , Potential participant also able self-refer , offer review clinical team participate centre decide patient whether trial might suitable . People experience severe hypoglycaemia fulfil eligibility criteria trial chose participate refer centre 's usual treatment pathway problematic hypoglycaemia , option include HARPdoc course outside trial . The exclusion criterion list condition lead exclusion qualitative research programme HARPdoc curriculum base .</detailed_description>
