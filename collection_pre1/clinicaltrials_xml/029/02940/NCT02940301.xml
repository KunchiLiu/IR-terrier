	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well ibrutinib nivolumab work treat patient classical Hodgkin lymphoma come back responded treatment . Ibrutinib may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Monoclonal antibody , nivolumab , may block cancer growth different way target certain cell . Giving ibrutinib nivolumab may work well treat patient classical Hodgkin lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ibrutinib Nivolumab Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate complete response ( CR ) rate ibrutinib standard dose 560 mg daily combination nivolumab 3 mg/kg intravenously ( IV ) every 3 week 16 infusion patient relapse refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma ( cHL ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine overall response rate ( ORR ) ibrutinib nivolumab combination patient relapse refractory classical HL . II . To determine safety toxicity ibrutinib combination nivolumab patient relapsed refractory cHL . III . To determine progression free survival ( PFS ) patient relapse refractory cHL treat combined ibrutinib nivolumab . IV . To determine duration response patient relapse refractory cHL treat ibrutinib combination nivolumab . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine effect ibrutinib nivolumab distribution T- , B- , NK cell peripheral blood . II . To determine effect ibrutinib nivolumab Th1/Th2 cytokine profile correlate treatment response . III . To determine effect ibrutinib nivolumab Th1/Th2 ration specific IgG sub-isotypes . OUTLINE : Patients receive ibrutinib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-21 nivolumab IV continuously 60 minute day 1.Treatment nivolumab repeat every 21 day 16 course treatment ibrutinib continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
