	<brief_summary>The main purpose present study investigate effect 12 week resistance training ( RT ) phase angle ( PhA ) , body composition , inflammatory oxidative stress biomarkers , old woman evaluate whether RT induce adaptation body composition , inflammatory oxidative stress biomarkers relate healthy adaptation PhA .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase Angle Body Composition , Inflammatory Oxidative Stress Biomarkers .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigation carry period 16 week , 12 week dedicate RT program 4 week allocate measurement . Anthropometric , body composition , blood sample measurement perform week 1-2 , 15-16 . A supervised progressive RT perform week 3-14 . The CG perform type physical exercise period . Recruitment carry newspaper radio advertising , home delivery leaflets central area residential neighborhood . All participant complete health history physical activity questionnaires meet follow inclusion criterion : 60 year old , physically independent , free cardiac orthopedic dysfunction , receive hormonal replacement therapy , perform regular physical exercise week six month precede begin investigation . After individual interview , 59 volunteer dismiss potential candidate meet inclusion criterion investigation . The remain 51 old woman randomly divide one two group : training group perform RT program control group perform type physical exercise . Anthropometric , body composition ( DXA ) , phase angle , total body water ( intra extracellular water compartment ; Xitron 4200 Bioimpedance Spectrum Analyzer ) , muscular strength ( 1RM ) , blood sample measurement perform pre- post-training . Two-way analysis variance repeat measure apply intra- inter-group comparison . When F-ratio significant , Fisher 's post hoc test employ identify mean difference . The statistical power determine verify statistical power analysis . Pearson 's correlation use evaluate correlation delta percent change body composition , muscular strength , inflammatory oxidative stress biomarkers ( independent variable ) percentage change PhA ( dependent variable ) . Subsequently , linear regression ( bivariate analysis ) perform variable present P &lt; 0.05 Pearson 's correlation analysis . For multiple comparison multivariate regression model perform . For statistical analysis , significance accept P &lt; 0.05 .</detailed_description>
