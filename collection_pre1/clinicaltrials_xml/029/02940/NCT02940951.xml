Handheld electronic information system increasingly use recommend facilitate QOL assessment . However , need information system best translated practice improvement ultimately may improve patient- family-centred outcome . This study try improve patient family caregiver QOL improve efficacy health care system study implementation innovative health care information system , Quality life Assessment Practice Support System ( QPSS ) , routine care provide home care service old adult life-limiting illness family caregiver . Research aims question : This integrate knowledge translation project involve work clinician , patient , family caregiver answer follow aim research question . Aim 1 : To examine efficacy QPSS home care old adult advance life-limiting illness . • Does routine use QPSS home care improve quality care , indicate patient ' family caregiver ' report enhance QOL experience care provide ? Aim 2 : To evaluate cost consequence implement QPSS home care . Aim 3 : To understand process implement QPSS home care . • How integration routine use QPSS home care old adult advance life-limiting illness family caregiver best facilitate ? Aim 4 : To examine integration QPSS health information system meet need administrator quality improvement accreditation . Design : This project conduct 3 stage 9 home care service site . The local adaptation stage use qualitative method ( user-centered design focus group interview clinician , manager , patient , family caregiver ) adapt QPSS unique context home care service site develop site-specific protocol routine integration daily practice .

During evaluation stage , investigator ( ) conduct randomize control trial evaluate impact use QPSS QOL care experience patient family caregiver ( Aim 1 ) ; ( b ) conduct economic evaluation estimate cost consequence implement QPSS home care ( Aim 2 ) ; ( c ) apply qualitative quantitative method examine process use QPSS home health care ( Aim 3 ) . The investigator aim recruit 540 patient 540 family caregiver . The sustainability stage focus discussion among team member ( ) whether result warrant sustain widespread integration QPSS practice , , ( b ) scale ( c ) QPSS best integrate health information system facilitate use health care administrator continuous quality improvement accreditation .
