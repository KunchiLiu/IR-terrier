	<brief_summary>The current trial aim explore neural behavioral effect oxytocin autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) . Oxytocin nonapeptide produce paraventricular supraoptic nucleus hypothalamus know play pivotal role variety complex social behavior . Initial study show intranasal administration oxytocin positive effect social functioning ASD . However , future study necessary explore whether oxytocin effect neural process brain underlying behavioral improvement . This trial measure behavioral enhancement , specifically focus elucidate associated neurophysiological change guide administration oxytocin regular neurophysiological assessment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The present study monocentric , between-subjects , randomize , placebo-controlled trial . The investigator recruit approximately 42 young-adult , male individual clinical diagnosis Autism Spectrum Disorder ( ASD ) . Participants randomly allocate experimental group ( Oxytocin ( OT ) ) control group ( Placebo ( PL ) ) . All participant receive frequency duration intervention . Behavioral neural outcome measure assess multiple time point period year . Participants test 5 occasion : ( T1 ) ( T2 ) single dose nasal spray , multiple dos nasal spray ( 1 daily dose nasal spray 4 week ) ( T3 ) , 4-week retention period ( T4 ) 48-week retention period ( T5 ) . At time point participant test behavioral neural level . Test performance participant group ( OT v PL ) compare measure reaction time accuracy rate computerize task assess person 's ability recognize bodily emotional state point light display . In addition , attachment , social functioning , restrict behaviour , general quality life mood assess via self-reported questionnaire . Functional MRI measurement perform 3T MR Philips Intera scanner . Before scan , subject undergo train session familiarize task instruction . In addition fMRI measurement , rest state fMRI Diffusion Tensor Imaging ( DTI ) also perform reveal alteration functional structural connectivity critical region . Statistical analysis behavioral data between-subject factor group ( OT v PL ) within-subject factor time ( change-from-baseline time point T2 , T3 , T4 T5 ) task ( emotion recognition task v control task ) . Image analysis perform Statistical Parametric Mapping ( SPM ) software . The investigator contrast either decrease increased activation , different region may show divergent change due receive nasal spray ( either OT PL ) .</detailed_description>
