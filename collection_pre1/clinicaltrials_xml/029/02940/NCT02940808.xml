	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND AND RESEARCH AIMS Cognitive control essential part cognitive functioning , allow top-down , goal-driven control stimulus-driven , automatic process . The prefrontal cortex ( PFC ) brain likely play important role many aspect cognitive control , include goal-driven attention , work memory , emotion regulation . Previous EEG study examine cognitive control identify potential electrophysiological marker PFC-mediated cognitive control . These study find ratio EEG-measured theta beta brain oscillation elevate child ADHD ( generally experience poor cognitive control ) , unselected adult poor attentional control . This theta/beta ratio ( TBR ) think reflect extent prefrontal brain activity exhibit regulatory control posterior subcortical brain area , make measure useful diagnosis treatment disorder related poor cognitive control ADHD . In present study , investigator propose new method validate TBR electrophysiological marker cognitive control , administer caffeine participant . Caffeine widely-known improve various aspect cognitive control , would expect go alongside decrease TBR . Importantly , cognitive control benefit maintenance task-relevant representation flexible updating representation . These cognitive control function may rely somewhat different area brain . Namely , whereas maintenance task-relevant representation may dependent PFC functioning , flexible updating representation may rely dopaminergic activity striatum . Theta/beta ratio marker PFC activity may thus specifically reflect task-relevant maintenance information , contrast EEG measure measure striatal dopamine activity may shed light nature TBR . In present study , investigator measure spontaneous eye-blink rate ( EBR ) , show sensitive dopaminergic striatal activity . The first aim present study validate theta/beta ratio ( TBR ) electrophysiological marker PFC-mediated cognitive control administer caffeine healthy participant . The investigator expect ( 1a ) theta/beta ratio inversely related cognitive control performance ( attentional focus , attentional shift , work memory ; measure TACT N-back ; possibly mainly relate TACT focus performance ) , ( 1b ) caffeine increase cognitive control performance , ( 1c ) caffeine decrease theta/beta ratio , ( 1d ) beneficial effect caffeine cognitive performance mediate decrease theta/beta ratio . The second aim study examine whether TBR EBR differentially moderate effect caffeine cognitive control . Namely , measure likely reflect activity different brain area , may predict differential ( possibly invert U-shaped ) effect caffeine depend baseline activity . For example , increase striatal dopamine caffeine consumption may beneficial initial striatal dopaminergic activity ( reflect baseline EBR ) high first place , , may result increase distractibility , rather improve cognitive flexibility . As , investigator expect ( 2a ) baseline TBR moderate effect caffeine cognitive control performance ( possibly mainly TACT focus performance ) , ( 2b ) baseline EBR moderate effect caffeine cognitive control functioning ( possibly mainly TACT shift performance ) . The third aim present study examine effect caffeine emotional processing , role TBR herein . Importantly , caffeine traditionally thought increase threat-related processing anxiety , especially high dos . However , increase number animal study show small dos caffeine may actually anxiolytic . In part , may due increase cognitive attentional control capability . Namely , although relation complex , anxiety attentional control influence mutually . Anxiety may increase vigilance threat-related processing , whereas attentional control capability may protect . An optimal dose caffeine could theoretically increase attentional control extent reduce over-processing threat-related information . However , dose-dependent effect dopamine , nor-adrenaline , caffeine predict optimal dosage depend basal level transmitter therefore possibly anxiety associate increased dopamine nor-adrenaline activity . The potential usefulness moderate dosage caffeine prophylactic drug ( attentional symptom ) anxiety may depend critically possible moderate influence anxiety . In present study , investigator examine relation take account moderate effect trait anxiety effect caffeine emotional processing . The investigator expect ( 3a ) high TBR relate increase interference EST , ( 3b ) moderate dose caffeine decrease emotional interference EST , ( 3c ) effect caffeine emotional interference mediate change TBR , ( 3d ) effect caffeine emotional interference moderate individual difference trait anxiety . Trait anxiety measure via self-report use STAI-t , add covariate analysis relation TBR AC examine . Finally , study investigator explore several possible confound factor relationship caffeine consumption cognitive control , include self-report measure trait state attentional control , anxiety , sleepiness , ADHD symptom . STUDY DESIGN A double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled , cross-over trial . After first training session , participant visit lab twice , separate approximately one week . In two lab session , participant orally consume one capsule contain 200mg pure caffeine ( similar amount caffeine find 2 cup coffee ) one capsule contain placebo filler substance ( randomize double-blind administration ) . Blinding randomization capsule allocation do pharmacy Leiden University Medical Center ( LUMC ) . PARTICIPANTS Forty healthy female volunteer ( age 18-26 year ) participate study . Participants fairly naïve caffeine consumption ( drink ≤100mg caffeine , one cup coffee , per day ) , ask abstain caffeine alcohol consumption 12h start lab session . Participants student recruit Leiden University various advertisement ( e.g. , university campus ) . Participants withdrawn study , possible , replace another randomly select participant . For replacement participant , LUMC pharmacist prepare blinded capsule contain placebo caffeine order original participant replacing . PROCEDURES After online screening procedure , eligible participant test time three separate day . Test session take place 10:00 17:00 , last approximately 2 hour per session . Participants ask abstain alcohol caffeine consumption 12 hour start experiment . On first testing ( train ) day , participant complete questionnaire assess demographic , trait level attentional control ( ACS ) , trait anxiety level ( STAI trait subscale ) , habitual sleepiness ( ESS ) , ADHD symptom ( ADHD Rating Scale-IV ) . Furthermore , resting-state EEG ( 8 minute alternate 1-minute block eye open/closed ) spontaneous EBR ( one eyes-open block 4 minute ) measure . In addition , participant familiarize cognitive task ( TACT ; N-Back ; EST ) . Participants complete measure reduce novelty learn effect subsequent test session . On day testing , state questionnaire ( current sleepiness , KSS ; attentional control , VAS ; anxiety , STAI state subscale ) administer 4min ( EBR ) 8min ( EEG ) baseline measure , end day ( i.e. , administer twice first training day , three time day 2/3 consumption day ) . The second testing day approximately one week first test day . Prior capsule consumption , EEG EBR measure . Participants receive capsule contain either caffeine ( 200mg ) placebo ( double-blind , randomized administration ) . After 30 minute break ( caffeine take half hour become active ) , EBR EEG measure . Finally , participant complete cognitive task complete first day . On third test day test protocol second day repeat , exception , remain caffeine ( 200mg ) placebo capsule administer . COGNITIVE CONTROL TASKS All cognitive task ( TACT ; N-Back ; Emotional Stroop Task ) program complete computer use E-Prime ( v2.0 ) . The cognitive control task describe . 1 . Two-Factor Attentional Control Task ( TACT ) : The TACT global/local congruency task aim measure attentional focusing attentional shifting . In task , participant show large arrow consist several small arrow point ( congruent ) opposite ( incongruent ) direction . Participants instruct respond direction large arrow small arrow fast possible without make many mistake . They press leave right arrow key keyboard , use index middle finger dominant hand . Prior appearance arrow , participant see grey screen 500ms word `` Large '' colour blue `` Small '' colour yellow appear 500ms , indicate arrow participant respond . After 250ms grey screen arrow appear middle screen , disappear 2000ms response give . On trial , arrow appear slightly different position ensure participant look arrow rather fixate pixel screen ( theory could sufficient identify direction arrow ) . In attentional focus part task , participant complete two block 52 trial . In one block participant respond direction large arrow , block participant respond direction small arrow . TACT focus performance measure subtract RTs congruent trial ( i.e. , trial inhibition distraction non-attended arrow necessary ) RTs incongruent trial ( i.e. , trial participant inhibit response distraction non-attended arrow ) . As , small difference RTs indicate well focus performance . In attentional shift part task , participant complete two block 120 trial , separate one-minute break , direction arrow participant respond change every six trial ( i.e. , 40 shift total ) . TACT shift performance calculate subtract RTs last two trial attentional shift RTs first two trial attentional shift ( i.e. , trial participant shift attention look large small arrow vice versa ) . As , small difference RTs indicate well shift performance . The two trial shift always incongruent increase difficulty ( thus likely shift cost ) task . The order focus block ( i.e. , large arrow small arrow first ) , order first complete focus shift block , counterbalance participant . Trials participant give incorrect response , improbably slow fast response , analyse . 2 . N-Back Task : The N-back task task assess different work memory process . In N-Back task , participant sequentially show letter . Participants indicate whether current letter match letter show n place , use 1 ( `` letter '' ) 2 ( `` different letter '' ) keyboard . The 1-back 3-back task administer , caffeine likely big influence 3-back task performance , may greatly differentially influence 1-back 2-back task performance . For n-back condition , 75 letter show total , 25 ( 33 % ) hit ( i.e. , trial show n place back ) . The first three trial block never target . Each letter show 500ms , follow 1500ms blank screen . Participants respond letter entire 2000ms interval . Prior n-back condition , participant receive instruction example task ( supervision researcher train day ) , complete 21 training trial ( 7 hit trial ) , make sure understand task . The order 1-back 3-back completion counterbalance participant . Performance measure examine accuracy score ( % correct ) , examine RTs correctly-answered trial . 3 . Emotional Stroop Task ( EST ) : The EST variant traditional Stroop task ( participant name colour word print different colour name , e.g . name colour word `` Red '' write blue ink ) . In EST , emotionally-laden picture show , colour square superimpose . Participants respond colour square , inhibit distract influence picture . Pictures choose IAPS database select base balance arousal rating represent three picture condition : neutral , negative , positive . For picture condition , 4 picture ( time square different location : top bottom x leave right ) show 8 time ( i.e. , 32 trial per condition , 96 trial total ) . The colour square randomly choose three possible option ( red , yellow , blue ) trial . During trial , first , picture show 200ms , colour square superimpose picture one four possible location . Participants get 1800ms respond colour square , use colour button standard response box . Then , 2000ms grey screen show , next picture appear . Prior actual task , participant complete 24 practice trial neutral picture show . Performance Emotional Stroop Task measure examine RTs negative positive condition trial , compare RTs neutral condition trial , correctly-answered trial . QUESTIONNAIRES All trait questionnaire ( ACS ; STAI-t ; ADHD Rating Scale-IV ; ESS ) program complete computer use E-Prime ( v2.0 ) . State questionnaire ( STAI-s ; VAS AC-s ; KSS ) complete use pen paper . The questionnaire describe . 1 . Attentional Control Scale ( ACS ) : A modified Dutch translation ACS administer participant . The ACS aim measure trait attentional control , assess 20 statement measure attentional shift ( e.g. , `` I quickly switch one task another '' ) , attentional focus ( e.g. , `` My concentration good even music room around '' ) flexible thought ( e.g. , `` I hard time come new idea quickly '' ) . Participants indicate extent statement reflect attentional control 4-point scale , range 1 ( `` almost never '' ) 4 ( `` always '' ) . 2 . State-Trait Anxiety Index ( trait subscale ; STAI-t ) : The trait scale Dutch STAI consist 20 item measure trait anxiety ( e.g. , `` I worry much something really n't matter '' ) . Participants respond item use 4-point rating scale , range 1 ( `` almost never '' ) 4 ( `` almost always '' ) . 3 . ADHD Rating Scale-IV : A modified Dutch translation ADHD Rating Scale-IV administer participant . This questionnaire consist 23 item measure ADHD symptom hyperactivity/impulsivity ( e.g. , `` I feel restless '' ) inattention ( e.g. , `` I quickly distract '' ) . Participants ask rate extent item apply past 6 month , scale 0 ( `` Never rarely '' ) 3 ( `` Very often '' ) . 4 . Epworth Sleepiness Scale ( ESS ) : The ESS use measure habitual sleepiness . On ESS , participant ask rate likely would doze eight usual recent situation ( e.g. , `` While watch television '' ) , use scale 0 ( `` Would never doze '' ) 3 ( `` High chance doze '' ) . 5 . State-Trait Anxiety Index ( state subscale ; STAI-s ) : The state scale Dutch STAI consist 20 item measure anxious participant feel moment ( e.g. , `` I feel calm '' , `` I worry '' ) . Participants respond item use 4-point rating scale , range 1 ( `` Not '' ) 4 ( `` A lot '' ) . 6 . Karolinska Sleepiness Scale ( KSS ) : The KSS 9-point VAS assess subjective , instantaneous sleepiness . Participants ask report alert sleepy scale 1 ( `` Very alert '' ) 9 ( `` Very sleepy ( fight sleep ) '' ) . 7 . VAS AC-s : The VAS attentional control scale consist six item assess participant ' current feeling attentional control ( e.g . `` I trouble concentrate '' ) . Participants indicate extent item reflect current attentional control mark 100mm line , anchor `` Not '' `` A lot '' leave right side . EBR AND EEG MEASUREMENT 1 . Spontaneous eye-blink rate ( EBR ) : Spontaneous EBR collect 4 min . eyes-open block use vertical EOG , record voltage difference two electrode place eye . In 4 min . interval , participant ask look central point room relax state . Individual EBR calculate divide total number eye blink 4 min . interval 4 . 2 . Spontaneous EEG : Spontaneous EEG record 8 min . continuously alternate 1-min block eye open/eyes close record . EEG recording acquire across scalp use 16 electrode , position accord international 10/20 system , use ActiveTwo BioSemi system . Electrodes place left right mastoid offline re-referencing scalp signal average mastoid signal . To measure eye blink movement , electrooculogram ( EOG ) electrodes place left eye ( vertical EOG ) external canthus eye ( horizontal EOG ) . Offline data processing do Brain Vision Analyzer V2.02 . A 0.1-Hz high-pass filter , 100-Hz low-pass filter , 50-Hz notch filter apply . Data analyze four-second segment . The data automatically correct ocular artifact segment contain remain artifact remove . A fast Fourier transformation ( resolution 0.25 Hz , use ham window 10 % ) apply calculate area power density beta ( 13-30 Hz ) , theta ( 4-7 Hz ) frequency band . The power density three frontal electrode average measure frontal beta frontal theta power density , use calculate theta/beta ratio , log-transformed case non-normality . DATA PROCESSING Outlier removal cognitive task do trial-to-trial basis ( exclude improbably fast and/or slow response ) participant . First rough RT removal apply , sophisticated removal outlying trial conduct . Based previous study task , follow trial remove : 1 . TACT : trial faster 200ms slow 1200ms , trial complete fast slow 2.5 SDs mean RT task remove . 2 . N-Back : trial faster 300ms remove . 3 . EST : trial faster 300ms slow 1200ms , trial complete fast slow 2.5 SDs mean RT task remove . There evidence stability TBR EBR time , complies notion marker reflect stable , trait-like neural process . However , influence state-dependent circumstance measure still fully understood . In present study , baseline TBR EBR measure day test , one TBR one EBR baseline measure use trait-like neural marker moderation analysis . The selection baseline measure use moderation analysis , base follow rule : 1 . If investigator find TBR EBR baseline measure day 1 highly similar ( mean comparison and/or correlation ) correspond baseline measure day 2 day 3 , day 1 baseline measure use moderation analysis . 2 . If investigator find TBR EBR baseline measure day 1 differ greatly correspond baseline measure day 2 OR day 3 , day 1 baseline measure use moderation analysis . 3 . If investigator find TBR EBR baseline measure day 1 , day 2 , day 3 , differ greatly , day 1 baseline measure use moderation analysis . 4 . If investigator find TBR EBR baseline measure day 2 day 3 highly similar , differ greatly correspond baseline measure day 1 , average baseline measure day 2 day 3 use moderation analysis .</detailed_description>
