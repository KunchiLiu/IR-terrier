	<brief_summary>The majority pregnant woman United States either overweight obese conception offspring great adiposity birth , 2-fold great risk later obesity neonatal insulin resistance . Conventional wisdom hold breast-milk composition uniform ; recently group question . An increase consumption dietary sugar include fructose past 30 year risen , associate chronic metabolic endocrine disorder phenotypic alteration promote obesity diabetes . However , prior study examine maternal increase sugars/fructose lactation affect breast-milk composition potential transmission infant . The objective proposal comprehensively assess presence pharmacokinetics sugar , include fructose human breast-milk response maternal consumption . The central hypothesis grade , dose-response relationship be-tween maternal adiposity sugar concentration breast-milk exist milk fructose concentration associate alter body composition first month life . This proposal , guide compelling preliminary data examine evidence link high intake milk fructose altered metabolism early obesity pursue two Specific Aims : 1 ) Test novel relationship breast-milk sugar change infant fat mass 2 ) Characterize pharmacokinetics milk sugar consume 20 oz . cola . These aim significant give intractability obesity/diabetes potentially identifiable novel target , make clear powerful public message reduce sugary beverage consumption lactation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>One highly effective preventive measure mother make protect health infant breastfeed . Despite extensive research breast-milk , limited information beyond basic micro/macronutrient composition currently exist literature . Breast-milk complex , non-uniform biological substance . In prior study PI show significant association be-tween non-nutritive constituent breast-milk ( e.g . IL-6 , TNF-α , insulin , leptin ) body composition infant start 4wks age . The putative causal influence breastfeed reduce obesity mixed clear probative evidence show causal pathway . Despite many study area , detailed study examine potential modifying role maternal diet , especially one high sugar compositional makeup three large breast-milk sugar ( glucose , galactose lactose ) none date look fructose . Animal model demonstrate obesogenic effect maternal fructose consumption transmit offspring via breast-milk fructose-fed lactating dam produce offspring double fast insulin level compare control pup . This relevant human increase dietary sugar consumption occur population . A mother/infant cohort ( n=37 ) establish detailed infant phenotypic body composition ( dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry ) detail breast-milk analysis ( insulin , leptin , IL-6 , TNF-α milk sugar glucose ) exclusively breast feed mother vary widely BMI ( 19 44 kg/m2 ) . Sampling breast-milk infant body composition occur 4 24wks . As proof concept , fructose detect breast-milk 9 mother significantly relate infant body fat , novel find date never report literature . Building upon prior work study determine concentration pharmacokinetics breast-milk sugar test beverage consume .</detailed_description>
