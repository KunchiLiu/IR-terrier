	<brief_title>Effects Fish Oil Physical Activity Fatigue Colorectal Cancer Patients Receiving Regorafenib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If participant find eligible take part study , participant randomly assign ( roll dice ) 1 3 study group . This do one know one study group well , , bad group . Participant equal chance assign group . - If participant Group 1 , participant take fish oil supplement mouth twice day perform physical activity 8 week . - If participant Group 2 , participant take placebo mouth twice day perform physical activity 8 week . A placebo drug . It look like study drug design treat disease illness . It design compare study drug learn study drug real effect . - If participant Group 3 , participant take placebo twice day perform stretch exercise 8 week . Participant meet exercise specialist first week teach participant different stretch . Fish Oil/Placebo Administration : After participant 's baseline test , participant give 8-week supply fish oil/placebo take home . Starting next morning , participant take 2 capsule twice day mouth 8 week . Participant take capsule food cup ( 8 ounce ) water around 8 o'clock morning 4 o'clock afternoon . Participant store fish oil capsule room temperature . Physical Activity : If participant Group 1 2 , participant complete resistance exercise walk program home 8 week . For resistance exercise , participant use color-coded tube 3 level resistance : light , moderate , hard . Participant move resistance participant gain strength . Participant begin 2 set 12 repetition . Participant complete exercise 3 day week least 48 hour session . Participant also ask walk least 5 day week . The study staff recommend long walk many time day walk . Participant also give log participant record number step participant take day . Participant must bring log participant study visit . If participant Group 3 , participant meet exercise specialist first week learn different stretching exercise . Participant complete stretching exercise 3 day week 8 week . Length Study Participation : Participant may continue receive fish oil/placebo participate physical activity 8 week . At end 8 week , depend group participant , participant may choose continue receive fish oil supplement additional 4 week . If participant receiving placebo , participant may begin take fish oil 4 week . If participant chooses continue begin receive fish oil , participant also take part physical activity describe Groups 1 2 4 week . Participant longer able take fish oil/placebo participate physical activity disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , participant unable follow study direction . Participation study participant complete follow-up visit . Study Visits : On Days 8 ( ± 3 ) , 21 ( ± 3 ) , 36 ( ± 5 ) , 50 ( ± 5 ) , participant complete 1 questionnaire symptom participant may . If participant make clinic , may complete phone call . The phone call last 10 minute . On Days 15 ( ± 3 ) 43 ( ± 5 ) : - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . - Participant ask complete 7 questionnaire participant complete baseline . If participant make clinic , questionnaire complete phone call . On Day 29 ( +/- 3 day ) : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . - Participant ask complete 7 questionnaire participant complete baseline . If participant make clinic , questionnaire complete phone . - Participant complete 6-minute walk test . - Participant complete 30-second chair-stand test . - Participant 's BMI REE measure . Participant receive 1 phone call week participant ask participant 's progress help problem participant may complete program . These call last 10-15 minute . End-of-Study Visit : At Day 57 ( +/-5 day ) : - Participant physical exam . - If do past 15 day , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . - Participant ask complete 7 questionnaire participant complete baseline 1 additional questionnaire ask participant 's symptom well bad start new treatment . - Participant complete 6-minute walk test . - Participant complete 30-second chair-stand test . - Participant 's BMI REE measure . - Participant return accelerometer pedometer study staff . Follow-Up Visit : One ( 1 ) month ( +/-5 day ) End-of-Study visit : - Participant ask complete 7 questionnaire participant complete baseline . - Participant complete 6-minute walk test . - Participant complete 30-second chair-stand test . This investigational study . Fish oil commercially available use dietary supplement . The use fish oil combination physical activity currently study . The study doctor explain study supplement design work . Up 96 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
