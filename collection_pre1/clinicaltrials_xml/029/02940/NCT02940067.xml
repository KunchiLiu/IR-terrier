	<brief_title>Enhancing Fitness Before Pancreatic Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pancreatic surgery high risk . The injury associate surgery cause stress response , comprise variety hormonal metabolic effect . Patients undergo pancreatic surgery experience one large stress response . Prehabilitation process enhance individual 's fitness , thereby improve tolerance upcoming physiological stress surgery . Studies involve prehabilitation show improve recovery surgery reduce complication rate . There currently publish report prehabilitation involve patient undergo pancreatic surgery . This research study explore effect prehabilitation patient . Patients pancreatic disease least fit surgical candidate due disease process . Exercise training improve physical fitness elective abdominal surgery nutritional supplementation also influence clinical course via different mechanism . Patients pancreatic disease often malnourish several reason . We propose multimodal approach prehabilitation involve dietary exercise intervention four-week period precede elective surgery . Core data collect cardiopulmonary exercise test blood test ( assess insulin sensitivity ) , prehabilitation . Secondary outcome length stay complication also measure postoperatively .</detailed_description>
