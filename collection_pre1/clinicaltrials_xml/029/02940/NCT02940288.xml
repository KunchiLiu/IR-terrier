However , adverse event relate opioid use ( nausea &amp; vomiting , pruritus , urinary retention , sedation ) may cause delay hospital discharge especially problematic certain sub-sets high risk patient obstructive sleep apnea prior history addiction . Investigators hypothesize auricular acupuncture use Battlefield Acupuncture Protocol decrease opioid consumption postoperative pain laparoscopic surgery minimal adverse event . The primary aim study assess effect BFA protocol postoperative analgesic consumption secondary aim assess pain score time discharge Post Anesthesia Care Unit follow laparoscopic surgery .</detailed_description>
