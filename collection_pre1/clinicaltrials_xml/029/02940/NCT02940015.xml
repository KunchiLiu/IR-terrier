	<brief_summary>Background : Scientists want improve new study environment , diet , genetic factor affect human health . To , need biological sample clinical data . They want find good way collect , handle , store , test sample data . This could make useful research . Objective : To collect anonymous sample clinical data people . To find good way collect , handle , store , test support health research . Eligibility : Healthy people age 18 old Design : Participants complete screen form phone person . The form could include question age , race , ethnicity , menopause status , pregnancy . Participants donate specific amount sample . This could blood , breast milk , cerumen , ear wax , exhale breath , hair , mucosal skin cell , nail clipping , saliva , semen , stool , urine . Participants may provide environmental sample dust , water , soil , air , plant life . Participants may get kit collect sample . They may also donate clinic visit . Visit take 30 minute . They may include : Sample collection Questions diet , smoking , alcohol use , medication , menstrual cycle , health Measurement body composition , naturally occur radioactivity , Doppler blood flow Moderate exercise Flexibility , muscle strength , sensory test Participants may ask participate several time study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Collection Biological Environmental Samples Clinical Data From Anonymous Adult Men Women Quality Control Methods Development Evaluation ( ASCA )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : We propose common protocol use non-invasive ( i.e. , minimal risk , involve general anesthesia sedation ) collection biological environmental sample clinical data anonymous adult volunteer method test protocol development , quality control , method development evaluation . Individual collection conduct protocol submit actual advertisement , form name person obtain consent IRB expedite review . Study Population : This protocol cover recruitment healthy non-pregnant adult ( men woman age 18+ ) and/or pregnant adult woman ( age 18+ ) . Design : All clinical data sample collection perform clinical research professional appropriate . Biological sample may collect include blood plasma , breast milk , cerumen , exhale breath , hair , mucosal skin cell , nail clipping , saliva , semen , stool urine . In case , lymphocyte isolate blood immortalize . Clinical data may collect non-invasive procedure routinely employ research clinical practice , use medical device approve marketing ( exclude procedure involve x-rays microwave ) . Clinical data collection may include anthropomorphic measurement , body composition assessment , detection naturally occur radioactivity , Doppler blood flow , exhale breath , flexibility testing , moderate exercise , muscular strength testing , physical sensor , sensory acuity test appropriate give age , weight health individual . Environmental sample may include dust , water , soil , air , vegetation , environmental sample may collect without damage property . Compensation clinical data sample donation depend time effort involve donation . Samples clinical data may collect one-time collection , participant may ask provide sample clinical data several occasion specify period . Outcome Measures : The sample clinical response data use determine propose research design feasible method sufficiently valid precise use epidemiologic study . They also use quality control purpose study sample analysis project . In epidemiologic study involve collection , storage analysis laboratory sample , essential evaluate performance available assay assess impact storage handle quality sample laboratory analysis . It also necessary determine level specific biomarkers population aid study design well willingness specific population group provide necessary sample data . It essential 1 ) demonstrate method sufficiently reproducible stable time difference measurement among individual population detect ; 2 ) evaluate measurement reliability send blind control sample along study sample test laboratory quality control purpose ; 3 ) test propose laboratory method use replicate sample order choose laboratory method great precision ; 4 ) ass collection , handle , storage procedure affect measure level specific analytes allow inform decision whether proceed specific analysis ; 5 ) determine level distribution propose biomarkers assess study feasibility determine appropriate study sample size ; 6 ) evaluate approach recruit participant propose study specific sample collection requirement . Under protocol , method may include analysis gene gene product , peptide , protein , lipid , immunologic parameter , hormone , viability cell , evaporation dilution effect , chemical toxicant metabolites , metal , micronutrient analytes .</detailed_description>
