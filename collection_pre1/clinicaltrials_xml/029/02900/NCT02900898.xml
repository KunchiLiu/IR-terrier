	<detailed_description>Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) chronic autoimmune disease characterize inflammation , joint pain , destruction synovial membrane metabolic alteration due mainly liberation tumor necrosis factor alpha interleukin-1 beta mainly leading change body composition rheumatoid cachexia , characterize involuntary loss muscular mass without loss body weight without gain fat mass therefore reduce physical activity affect nutrition . Alternative therapy could improve metabolical change `` Dynamic exercise '' ( DE ) demonstrate improve muscular function muscular strength , well joint mobility joint inflammatory marker without negative effect RA . Also , `` Mediterranean diet '' ( MD ) recommend reduce inflammation high intake monounsaturated polyunsaturated low saturate fat . Previous study report benefit nutritional intervention majority case therapy base specific food form diet . Likewise , physical intervention different regard time type movement . However intervention show ambiguous finding term body composition ( mainly ) prevents draw conclusion generate recommendation implementation therapy ( combination ) . As far investigator know , study evaluate effect diet exercise combine . Thus aim study assess effect DE program combination MD body composition , strength , joint mobility disease activity woman RA .</detailed_description>
