	<brief_summary>Although allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant ( AlloHSCT ) curative treatment option malignant hematological disease , also associate significant morbidity graft versus host disease , infection , immune complication . Moreover , long-term survivor likely reduce physical performance functioning due deconditioning , sarcopenia , bone loss , particularly high level fatigue psycho-social stress , negatively impact patient ' quality life . Purpose : To conduct randomize control , single site trial investigate whether partially supervise exercise intervention first 100 day post alloHSCT patient result improve quality life Day 100 post-transplant compare standard care treatment . Secondary objective investigate effect exercise intervention muscle strength , cardiorespiratory fitness , mobility , bone mineral density , body composition , exercise , immunological/inflammatory biomarkers compare standard care . Procedure : 120 patient receive alloHSCT baseline test , randomize Exercise Intervention Group Standard Care Control Group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This randomize non-blinded single centre prospective clinical trial design evaluate efficacy safety partially-supervised progressive exercise intervention among patient undergo alloHSCT compare self-directed exercise program . Approximately 120 patient enrol . Following completion baseline data collection , participant randomize 1:1 intervention group control group . Patients intervention group receive exercise manual background information , description different resistance aerobic exercise , instruction tailor intensity exercise . All patient receive Therabands™ resistance exercise access stationary bicycle aerobic exercise practical introduction exercise specialist . The partially supervise intervention progressive program goal three aerobic two resistance exercise session per week . Aerobic exercise consist 10-30 minute bicycle use stationary bike ( supervise unsupervised ) brisk walking , follow Borg Scale Rate Perceived Exertion ( RPE ) . Resistance exercise include exercise upper low extremity Therabands™ . Exercise adapt base participant 's clinical status safety ability perform exercise . At weekly supervise session , exercise specialist provide adequate progression exercise , review adherence intervention provide support question overcome identified barrier adherence . Participants assign control group receive current standard care . They review ward physiotherapist admission hospital encourage maintain physical activity walk around inpatient unit inpatient hospitalization . As per standard care , physiotherapist available need basis inpatient outpatient setting . Timely assessment outcome measure outline `` Outcome Measures '' section conduct group .</detailed_description>
