	<brief_title>Study Pembrolizumab With Without CC-486 Patients With Platinum-resistant Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , non-randomized , four-cohort study , intravenous pembrolizumab combine 4 different schedule administration CC-486 ( oral azacitidine ) , treatment platinum-resistant/refractory ( EOC ) . This also futility trial strategy combine pembrolizumab CC-486 EOC . Eligible subject treat one four cohort combine oral CC-486 intravenous pembrolizumab ( 200 mg intravenous ( IV ) every 3 week cohort ) evaluate safety combination schedule preliminary data efficacy . The primary objective establish optimal dose schedule comparison pembrolizumab alone . Subjects assign treatment cohort order enrol study . In subject , tumor tissue obtain via image-guided core biopsy study entry 6 week commence treatment CC-486 . A cohort remain open accrual five subject treat cohort complete two CC-486 cycle first post-baseline tumor burden assessment tumor biopsy perform adequate paired tissue obtain . At least 20 subject accrue estimated period approximately 6 month . Subjects treat assigned cohort progressive disease base Immune-Related Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ( irRECIST ) , unacceptable toxicity , consent withdrawal Investigator conclude subject´s best interest discontinue . Once 5 subject cohort consider evaluable response , toxicity treatment response analyze four cohort optimal schedule select . This study include mandatory tumor core biopsy biomarkers research mandatory whole blood sample deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) methylation analysis .</detailed_description>

Documented platinumresistant platinumrefractory disease . Platinumresistant disease define progression within &lt; 6 month completion minimum 4 platinum frontline therapy cycle pre postoperative setting ( date calculate last administer dose platinum agent ) . Platinumrefractory define disease recurred/progressed receive platinumbased frontline therapy . Measurable disease accord ImmuneRelated Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ( irRECIST ) Indication systemic treatment relapse EOC , FTC PPC . Subjects must tumor lesion amenable imageguided core biopsy willingness undergo two biopsy ( baseline 6 week first dose study treatment ) . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance status ( PS ) 0 1 . Expected survival 6 month . Adequate organ function within 7 day prior enrollment , define follow criterion : Absolute neutrophils count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.5 x 10E9/L , platelet ≥ 100 x 10E9/L , hemoglobin &gt; 9 g/dL ( without transfusion erythropoiesis stimulate agent dependency ) .
