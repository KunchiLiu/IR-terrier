The final aim conduct pilot randomize control trial ( RCT ) test develop protocol youth tic disorder co-morbid ADHD . Half subject undergo treatment modify protocol , half subject receive standard CBIT treatment . A broad range outcome measure use evaluate tic symptom , ADHD symptom , quality life , predictor treatment response explore . Additionally , investigator compare component most/least helpful subject . Though investigator evaluate efficacy modify protocol , primary purpose remain feasibility .
