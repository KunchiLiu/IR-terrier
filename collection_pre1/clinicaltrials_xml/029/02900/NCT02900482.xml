	<brief_title>Research Genetic Factors Involved Congenital Dislocation Hip : Genome-wide Association Study Grand West France</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Congenital hip dislocation ( CHD ) one frequent skeleton abnormality Caucasian population ( incidence : 2-10 / 1000 ) . This disease result abnormality report femoral head acetabulum , generate morphological defect cavity / joint hypermobility . This condition define multifactorial disease involve one hand , mechanical factor related condition pregnancy childbirth , secondly , genetic factor suggest ethnic predisposition familial aggregation observe . Despite neonatal screening , CHD remain public health problem high frequency , functional handicap lead case late diagnosis natural evolution coxarthrosis . CHD object significant number publication difficult aspect screen treatment , moment , data available genetic factor involve . The genetic study lead CHD base study case-control association , focus candidate gene , genetic linkage analysis , two strategy classically use genetic epidemiology . To date , strategy allow elucidate genetic determinism pathology . The considerable progress make recent year field knowledge human genome variability , development methodological technological tool allow good understand genetic determinism complex diseases CHD . The development technique broadband sequence , new generation say sequencing ( NGS Next Generation Sequencing ) make indeed accessible sequence whole genome set cod region ( exome ) allow identify rare variant , say variant minor allele frequency le 1 % . These variant previously recognizable strategy traditionally use genetic epidemiology , base study common variant ( minor allele frequency ≥ 5 % ) list public database human genome . The NGS sequencing technique make possible address problem study complex diseases new light appear necessary apply strategy CHD search genetic factor involve pathology .</detailed_description>
