	<detailed_description>Objectives : To study incidence etiological spectrum febrile illness occur travel tropic , well clinical course , care , treatment outcome febrile illness episode . Design : Prospective cohort study febrile illness international traveler Population : Travelers go destination tropic ( South-East Asia ( SEA ) , Sub-Saharan Africa ( SSA ) South America ( SCA ) ) 3 week longer invited participate , obtain informed consent , recruit study protocol ( ) time plan departure ( directly ITM travel/ humanitarian relief organization ) . Methods : Participants offer pre- , per- post-travel consultation explain ( Inclusion ITM ) 1 . Pre-travel consultation certify travel clinic systematically recommend ; consultation include : 1. routine travel advice direct travel destination , ( include vaccination prescription anti-malarial chemoprophylaxis accord current recommendation , detail publish www.reisgeneeskunde.be 2. follow research-related activity . - Briefing session topic `` Fever The Tropics '' ITM physician ( session difference fever home tropic address importance consult local doctor stress ) . - Collection record demographic , clinical travel data . - Sampling baseline serum sample ( paired pre- post-travel diagnostic analysis ) . - Training traveler , peer travel guide blot capillary blood filter paper ( train prerequisite study participation ) . - Provision study material ( study diary/apps , malaria kit , thermometer , … ) write instruction use travel fever occur ( see ) 2 . During travel - In case illness ( associate fever ) , traveler record symptom study diary . - If fever document ( axillary temperature ≥ 37.8°C - case thermometer immediately available , fever sensation association sweat chill ) - blood finger prick collect blot onto filter paper ( BFP ) train traveler peer . - All febrile traveler advise seek medical attendance would participate study . - The final decision use standby emergency treatment malaria treatment ( SBET ) make study participant , accordance precise write instruction . - The study team ( Tropical medicine expert ITM ) available teleconsultation Email Telephone , provide medical advice within 12 hour . Note : contacting ITM study team option , cause delay treat suspect malaria . - Study participant collect relevant data relate ( outcome ) illness episode ( duration symptom , consultation health practitioner , admission/duration stay hospital , treatment receive timing , repatriation ) 3 . Post-travel consultation schedule study participant experience ( ) illness ( febrile ) within week travel- sooner medical condition require so- complaint seek post-travel health evaluation . - A structured clinical evaluation perform expert travel medicine record database . Laboratory evaluation include hematological , biochemical microbiological/parasitological analysis - Used BFPs ( i.e . case febrile illness travel ) collect confirmation test result Polymerase Chain Reaction ( PCR ) . A diagnostic protocol/ algorithm develop use BFPs source post-travel diagnosis arboviral/ rickettsial infection PCR . - Data analysis : All data ( demographic , geographic , clinical , laboratory final diagnosis ) record encoded database . Descriptive inferential statistic appropriate , STATA 14 . - Sample size : n= 350 fever case ; incidence fever 8 % cohort 4400 ( healthy ) traveler recruit 30 month ( Feb 2016 - Aug 2018 ) . - Endpoints : - Incidence rate malaria arboviral/ rickettsial infection ( paired serology post-travel PCR BFP ) per travel destination . - Clinical course outcome ( self- ) management febrile illness travel . ( Clinical spectrum disease , incidence rate febrile illness ; duration fever symptom , management ( self-treatment , consultation , admission ) , type treatment ( symptomatic/empiric/targeted RDT malaria positive ) , final outcome ( change travel plan , repatriation , hospitalization result illness travel ) . Expected result relevance : The study yield valuable prospective data incidence rate , clinical etiological spectrum , clinical course outcome febrile illness ( post- ) travel prospective cohort traveler . This knowledge may lead good pre-travel advice .</detailed_description>
