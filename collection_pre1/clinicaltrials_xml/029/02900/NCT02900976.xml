	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study rituximab latent membrane protein ( LMP ) -specific T-cells work treat pediatric solid organ recipient Epstein-Barr virus-positive , cluster differentiation ( CD ) 20-positive post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder . Monoclonal antibody , rituximab may block tumor growth different way target certain cell . LMP-specific T-cells special immune system cell train recognize protein find post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder tumor cell infect Epstein-Barr virus . Giving rituximab LMP-specific T-cells may better treat pediatric organ recipient post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder rituximab alone .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine feasibility treat pediatric young adult solid organ transplant recipient newly diagnose recurrent Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) -positive CD20-positive post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease ( PTLD ) novel T cell therapeutic , allogeneic Latent Membrane Protein ( LMP ) 1/LMP2-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes ( third party latent membrane protein [ LMP ] -specific T cell ) , cooperative group set . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine percentage eligible patient suitable LMP-specific T cell product derive third party LMP-specific T cell bank available . II . To estimate response rate ( RR ) three dos rituximab ( RTX ) single agent child young adult EBV-positive CD20-positive PTLD solid organ transplantation ( SOT ) . III . To estimate 2-year event-free survival ( EFS ) child young adult EBV-positive CD20-positive PTLD SOT treat RTX with/without LMP-specific T cell . IV . To estimate overall survival ( OS ) child young adult EBV-positive CD20-positive PTLD SOT treat RTX with/without LMP-specific T cell . V. To estimate RR LMP-specific T cell child young adult EBV-positive CD20-positive PTLD SOT complete response RTX . VI . To estimate progression-free survival ( PFS ) child young adult EBV-positive CD20-positive PTLD SOT treat RTX with/without LMP-specific T cell . VII . To describe toxicity third party LMP-specific T cell child young adult EBV-positive CD20-positive PTLD SOT treat RTX LMP-specific T cell . VIII . To validate absence EBV viremia correlate RR , EFS OS . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether third party LMP-specific T cell promote autologous immune reconstitution EBV-specific T cell . II . To determine whether EBV viremia inversely correlated increase EBV-specific T cell vivo . III . To determine whether plasma cytokine profile change cytokines time correlate treatment response toxicity ( e.g . cytokine release syndrome ) . OUTLINE : INDUCTION : Patients receive rituximab intravenously ( IV ) day 1 , 8 , 15 . Course continue 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity Patients assign 1 2 arm . ARM I ( RTX ) : Patients newly diagnose PTLD achieve complete response ( CR ) receive additional rituximab induction . ARM II ( LMP-TC ) : Patients newly diagnose PTLD achieve partial response ( PR ) , stable disease ( SD ) , progressive disease ( PD ) , recurrent PTLD regardless response induction , receive allogeneic LMP1/LMP2-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes IV 1- 2 minute day 0 7 . Course continue 42 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients PR SD first course course allogeneic LMP1/LMP2-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes receive additional course . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 month .</detailed_description>
