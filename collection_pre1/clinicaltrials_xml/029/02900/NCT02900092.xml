	<brief_title>Augmentation Treatment-Resistant Depression With An Analog Neuroactive Steroid Allopregnanolone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Major depressive disorder ( MDD ) highly prevalent profoundly negative consequence one 's health , well-being productivity . Women twice likely men experience depression lifetime . In fact , report twelve million woman U.S. year experience depression , one eight woman experience clinical depressive episode lifetime . Additionally , nearly 70 % individual MDD respond standard antidepressant therapy despite adequate dosing . Therefore , identification effective well tolerate antidepressant augmentation therapy would important clinical public health implication . Neuroactive steroid hormone know directly activate neurotransmitter receptor brain , thus potential candidate augmentation therapy enhance effect traditional antidepressant . Specifically , allopregnanolone , steroid hormone derive progesterone , potent positive modulator GABA action GABA-A receptor , know positive effect mood symptom . Data suggest depression , chronic stress posttraumatic stress disorder may associate low central nervous system allopregnanolone level . The investigator propose administer oral allopregnanolone analog 10 postmenopausal woman treatment-resistant depression add-on therapy current treatment period 8 week follow 2-week taper . The investigator hypothesize administration oral allopregnanolone analog woman treatment-resistant depression improve depressive symptom .</detailed_description>
