	<detailed_description>Breast cancer common cancer among woman , affect one eight woman , second lead cause mortality cancer . Bone metastases frequent complication breast cancer , mechanism breast cancer metastases bone ongoing area research.. Receptor activator NF-kB ( RANK ) ligand ( RANKL ) identify characterized role bone remodel . RANKL member tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) family cytokine bind receptor RANK control osteoclast differentiation , activation , survival . RANK protein expression find osteoclast dendritic cell also T cell mammary epithelial cell . RANK RANKL important lymph node thymus formation well lactate mammary gland development pregnancy . Furthermore , RANK/RANKL axis link progestin driven breast carcinoma bone metastasis . RANK express 6-57 % invasive human breast cancer ( depend upon parameter define positivity antibody utilized immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) ) , RANKL drive hormone ( progesterone -dependent proliferation , survival , nonproliferative expansion mammary stem cell may contribute breast cancer initiation , progression , recurrence . We hypothesize denosumab inhibit RANKL signal early breast tumor express RANK , inhibit pro-metastatic mechanism reduce immunosuppression tumor microenvironment . This test pre-surgical clinical trial ( Phase 0 ) evaluate select pharmacodynamics marker RANKL inhibition breast cancer .</detailed_description>
