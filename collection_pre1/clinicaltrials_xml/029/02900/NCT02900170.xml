	<brief_summary>Anticoagulation-Related Nephropathy ( ARN ) side effect treatment blood thinner lead kidney dysfunction . A recent review suggest kidney function assess ( measure serum creatinine ) serially first month start blood thinner . ARN diagnose decline kidney function start blood thinner possible cause decline exclude . ARN mainly study relation common blood thinner - warfarin , prevalence variable high 37 % ( approximately 1 3 ) patient high risk . The risk factor make side effect likely include presence pre-existing kidney disease , high blood pressure , old age diabetes mellitus . Studies show occurence ARN lead accelerate progression pre-existing kidney disease 65 % increase risk death ( mortality ) . The non-vitamin K oral anticoagulant ( NOACs ) new group drug recently approve use blood thinner . They faster onset action compare warfarin unlike warfarin , need frequent monitoring . Rivaroxaban commonly prescribe NOAC Einstein Medical Center Philadelphia . There case report NOACs ( dabigatran apixaban ) lead ARN , however study determine true incidence ARN NOACs . Our study design find incidence ARN patient start rivaroxaban . The investigator intend serially monitor kidney function 40 high risk patient recently start rivaroxaban six month period . This enable u discover many patient actually develop ARN start NOAC . The information investigator obtain study enable patient health care provider make good decision use blood thinner . If investigator find incidence ARN rivaroxaban less common previously report warfarin , potentially make patient use NOACs hence save morbidity mortality associate ARN . Our study unique first study focus ARN one new blood thinner . The information investigator get study important foundation future study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Can Rivaroxaban Lead Anticoagulation-Related Nephropathy ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anticoagulation-related nephropathy ( ARN ) understudy renal complication anticoagulant therapy characterize acute kidney injury ( AKI ) define increase baseline serum creatinine ≥ 0.3 mg/dL , without alternate etiology , set supra-therapeutic International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) great 3.0 [ 1-7 ] . ARN mainly study relation warfarin , usually occur first two month start anticoagulant therapy retrospective study estimate prevalence range 16 % 37 % [ 4-6 ] . The strong risk factor ARN pre-existing chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) ; risk factor include old age , diabetes mellitus hypertension [ 1,4 ] . Patients ARN accelerate progression CKD retrospective study 15,000 patient warfarin show 65 % increase mortality patient ARN [ 4,6 ] . The non-vitamin K oral anticoagulant ( NOACs ) replace warfarin clinical setting long term anticoagulation advantage faster , reliable onset action , unlike warfarin , require dose-response monitoring [ 8-10 ] . Rivaroxaban commonly prescribe NOAC Einstein Medical Center Philadelphia . A animal model case report show NOACs ( particularly dabigatran apixaban ) lead deterioration kidney function , limited epidemiologic data ARN NOACs incidence ARN NOACs unknown [ 11-14 ] . A proposed guideline diagnose ARN recommend serum creatinine urinalysis check monthly first month anticoagulation [ 1 ] . Clinical trial compare warfarin NOACs specifically study stroke risk bleed outcome document incidence ARN make regular creatinine urinalysis measurement first month anticoagulation [ 15-20 ] . Our study intend make necessary measurement select group high risk patient start rivaroxaban hence determine incidence ARN group . This study first epidemiological study use prospective design measure incidence ARN population receive NOACs . Given high morbidity mortality associate ARN , finding enhance patient safety , enable patient health provider make informed decision patient regard choice anticoagulant . It also establish baseline data serve foundation future study . The specific aim study - 1 . Determine incidence ARN high risk patient rivaroxaban . Hypothesis - incidence ARN rivaroxaban less previously report incidence ARN warfarin . 2 . Describe demographic urinalysis-associated predictor ARN patient rivaroxaban . SIGNIFICANCE Anticoagulant-related nephropathy ( ARN ) relatively new underdiagnosed complication anticoagulant therapy potential accelerate chronic kidney disease lead increase mortality [ 4,6 ] . Brodsky , et al , perform retrospective study 15,000 subject show 5-year Kaplan-Meier survival rate significantly low ARN cohort compare patient without ARN 65 % increase risk mortality [ 4 ] . This dramatic increase mortality attributable episode ARN patient take anticoagulant reason study significant . The clinical trial compare NOACs warfarin specifically study ARN repeat creatinine urinalysis test first two three month therapy establish possible ARN diagnosis [ 15-20 ] . In study , baseline creatinine creatinine level 6 12 month later analyze , hence possible ARN under-diagnosed case ARN detect first eight week therapy . Our study aim accurately capture ARN case make measurement monthly first three month start anticoagulant . This study pivotal first time , define incidence ARN patient rivaroxaban therapy . If investigator find ARN incidence patient start rivaroxaban less see warfarin , help support evidence NOAC safer kidney compare warfarin data enable u make evidence base decision regard continue use medication help patient . If hand investigator find medication lead ARN , investigator contribute important post-marketing surveillance data also help u make safety decision use medication future . INNOVATION Previous study ARN utilize retrospective study design many epidemiological pitfall include cause versus effect bias inability ascertain relative risk [ 1 ] . Our study unique investigator intend utilize prospective epidemiological design study renal complication , first study ARN . This important ARN diagnosis exclusion hence prospective study able accurately define case condition compare assumption make retrospective study work do retrospect . This first epidemiological study focus ARN NOAC . Even though NOACs new , become ubiquitous mainstay clinical practice alternative warfarin . For example , recent CHEST guideline recommend first line therapy treatment venous thromboembolism [ 8 ] . Hence important clearly delineate effect kidney . OBJECTIVES In summary , proposal prospective study investigate incidence anti-coagulant nephropathy , dread renal complication anticoagulation . Our literature search show prospective study condition new oral anticoagulant clinical trial perform necessary test appropriately time interval diagnose ARN . The investigator choose study rivaroxaban , commonly prescribe NOAC academic medical center anticipate result study contribute safety data lead good care patient great cost saving avoid morbidity mortality associate renal disease .</detailed_description>
