Those diagnosed clinical condition antibiotic might necessary accord history clinical examination GP considers antibiotic need patient feel antibiotic regimen work expect ; 3 . Several dos antibiotic take leftover find household obtain pharmacy without medical prescription clinical condition antibiotic necessary . The patient randomly assign usual strategy continue antibiotic treatment ( usual intervention group ) discontinue antibiotic therapy ( novel intervention group ) . A sample size 215 patient per group calculate basis reduction one day duration severe symptoms clinically relevant outcome . The primary outcome duration severe symptom , i.e . symptom score 5 6 mean symptom diary . Secondary outcome include : antibiotic take , adverse event , patient satisfaction , complication within first 3 month . A post-trial implementation observational clinical study mean qualitative analysis plan carry clinical trial know percentage use strategy discontinue antibiotic treatment pro con use . Ethics dissemination : The study approve Ethical Board Fundació Jordi Gol Gurina ( reference number : 16/093 ) inform consent obtain patient include .
