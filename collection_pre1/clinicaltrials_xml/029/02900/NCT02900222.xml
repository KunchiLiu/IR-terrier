	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether endoscopic choroid plexus coagulation safe adult patient communicate hydrocephalus risk factor complication standard surgical treatment . It may also help determine whether endoscopic choroid plexus coagulation effective treat communicate hydrocephalus . The Investigators hope research allow u place few shunt patient condition similar , avoiding complication .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Choroid Plexus Cauderization Patients With Hydrocephalus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The patient undergo endoscopic choroid plexus coagulation surgery treat communicate hydrocephalus . Before surgery , patient examine his/her doctor undergo brain MRI , part routine clinical care . For surgery , he/she place general anesthesia . An incision make top head , small opening make bone skull . An endoscope , long , thin metal tube attach video camera channel pass small instrument , pass ventricle brain opening . After surgeon identifies choroid plexus one side brain use endoscope , electrical current use destroy much choroid plexus side possible . A balloon instrument use open membrane separate right leave half brain . The endoscope use identify choroid plexus opposite side brain , electrical current use destroy much choroid plexus side , possible . The ventricle brain wash saline solution remove blood debris , endoscope remove brain . A temporary drainage tube may leave place monitor fluid pressure surgery . The opening skull scalp close . The patient awaken anesthesia brought either recovery room intensive care unit . The patient observe hospital least one night , undergo MRI brain surgery part routine clinical care . The patient follow visit surgery , part routine clinical care . During hospitalization procedure , follow clinic visit , treat doctor examine interview patient part routine clinical care . The researcher collect information examination , interview , , appropriate , brain imaging study order determine whether surgery cause complication , whether prevent patient require ventricular shunt .</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Hydrocephalus</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Adult patient ( age 18 old ) communicate hydrocephalus , risk factor complication follow shunt surgery . Risk factor include loculated hydrocephalus ( i.e. , image evidence ventricle brain communicate , set know communicate hydrocephalus ) ; prior episode ventriculitis and/or shunt infection ; subdural hematoma associate shunt placement ; inability place distal catheter peritoneal cavity due scar prior infection ; multiple prior episode shunt failure . In patient communicate hydrocephalus significantly increase lateral third ventricular size normal fourth ventricular size , endoscopic third ventriculostomy perform conjunction choroid plexus cauterization , provide communicate hydrocephalus thought present , base either history ( example , past meningitis infectious inflammatory disease , history communicate hydrocephalus without disproportion ventricle past ; image finding , patency foramen Magendie Luschka ) . Exclusion criterion include patient noncommunicating hydrocephalus ; patient undergo emergency surgery rapid decline neurologic condition ; patient medical condition coagulopathy severe cardiac condition , preclude neurosurgical intervention . In case adult unable consent , informed consent obtain appoint health care proxy . Minors , pregnant woman , prisoner exclude study .</criteria>
