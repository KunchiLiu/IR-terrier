	<brief_summary>The investigator hope learn Letrozole effective safe improve severe male infertility increase testosterone , decrease oestradiol stimulate sperm production thereby improve sperm motility ( movement ) concentration . The study conduct Letrozole yet proven standard treatment subject absent low sperm count . The investigator hop determine whether Letrozole equal superior treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Letrozole Seminal Parameters Men With Non Obstructive Azoospermia Severe Oligozoospermia .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot study recruitment carry single centre participant assign receive Letrozole 2.5 mg day 4 month . The following data collect : semen analysis , clinical history include smoking status , BMI , Y microdeletion , karyotype FSH , LH , testosterone , E2 , drug side effect effect libido . The following assessment perform 4 month drug administration : sperm analysis , FSH , LH , E2 testosterone measurement . Prior recruitment , study participant would undergo routine investigation evaluate azoospermia severe oligozoospermia . These would include FSH , LH , testosterone , karyotyping , Y chromosome microdeletion genetic study least 1 seminal analysis . Despite availability biochemical technique differentiate non-obstructive azoospermia ( NOA ) patient obstructive azoospermia patient , fine needle aspiration ( FNA ) regard highly informative minimally invasive method often routinely do investigation azoospermia . All patient NOA would FNA perform part routine workup would do recruitment initiation Letrozole . The safety FNA use also regard supportive researcher possible patient lawsuit result impaired spermatogenesis induce off-label prescription . All oligozoospermic patient offer sperm cryopreserved drug administration . The investigation must perform within 6 month time frame prior recruitment . There 3 clinic visit dose period 1 post dose follow visit . During initial visit recruitment study occur , participant prescribe medication . One week later , telephone interview conduct review side effect arrange early appointment patient request . One month later , participant review clinic side effect check list conduct . Telephone interview conduct 2nd 3rd month administration drug . At 4th month administration drug , blood test semen analysis perform . It likely participant still follow enrolment IVF / ICSI programme spontaneous pregnancy fail occur . The window period clinic visit telephone interview +/- 5 day .</detailed_description>
