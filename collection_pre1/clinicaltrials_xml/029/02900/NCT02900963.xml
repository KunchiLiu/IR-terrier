	<brief_summary>Radiotherapy chemotherapy standard treatment head neck cancer alone associate surgical treatment . Early ( treatment follow week ) late side effect contribute malnutrition population risk . In context , nutritional support adapt dietary monitoring enteral nutrition ( nasogastric tube gastrostomy ) often necessary . The early identification patient high malnutrition risk require enteral nutrition necessary improve tolerance efficacy treatment . This prospective study research factor malnutrition head neck radiotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nutritional Status Assessment Head Neck Cancer Patients Receiving Radiotherapy Chemo-radiotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Head neck cancer one common malignancy world , Malnutrition occur frequently time diagnosis consequence alcohol consumption tobacco use quite common patient population , local tumor invasion , obstruct function swallow chew . In addition , treatment , mucositis , anorexia , dysphagia , mouth sore , acute late toxic effect radiotherapy ( RT ) chemotherapy frequently worsen nutritional status . Poor nutritional status chemotherapy RT-toxicity , lead treatment interruption frequently also associate high risk infection , hospital readmission , early death , bad survival outcome , deterioration quality life ( QoL ) . According publish result , one third patient would benefit complete treatment . In addition , correlation exist biological parameter ( CRP , albumin , neutrophil , Hb ) nutritional status . Therefore , deem essential maintain nutritional status head neck cancer patient undergo RT chemotherapy . Dietary counsel oral supplement show positive influence nutritional outcome QoL However , role limit come obstruction mucositis . Thus , enteral feeding may choice either nasogastric tube ( NGT ) percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy ( PEG ) . Studies investigated effect PEG compare NGT conclusive showing consistent result nutritional status , treatment interruption , nutrition-related hospital admission , tube-related complication head neck cancer patient receive RT chemo-radiotherapy . The optimal method timing placement still debate . Consequently , aim study collect data current daily practice supplementary nutrition method ( NGT , PEG ) head neck cancer patient treated radiation therapy unit identify factor predict good treatment outcome ( ie full treatment administration ) . Secondary objective collect nutritional data treatment , study nutritional status relation acute late adverse event , study impact early enteral feed clinical biological parameter . Ancillary study : Sarco-Nutrineck The aim ancillary study collect data prevalence low muscle mass population , treatment outcome survival . Study measure : At baseline : body height weight , calculate BMI . Biological parameter : albumin , orosomucoid , transthyretin , CRP Daily - treatment period : weight Weekly - treatment period : albumin , orosomucoid , transthyretin , CRP . The Nutritional inflammatory status score calculate . Clinical criterion requirement enteral nutrition ( need artificial nutrition ) case weight loss persist least three day radiotherapy : The aim study investigate whether nutritional screening admission use determine risk level adverse clinical event treatment outcome ( full treatment administration ) head neck cancer propose risk stratification base nutritional screening radiotherapy concomitant chemo radiotherapy . tube ( NGT ) place accord following procedure : The weight assess daily basis compare figure baseline , treatment . If weight loss superior 2 kg , patient consult radiotherapist perform physical examination , nutritional assessment ( history , appetite change , taste , quantity quality oral food intake , medication , detail regard weight change BMI ) . In addition dietary counsel oral supplementation , If indicate , analgesic drug treatment associate mucositis prescribed . In case persist weight loss severe dysphagia oral solid food intake , nasogastric tube ( NGT ) place nurse personalized nutritional counselling dietician organize . Biological exam do accord local practice standard , result analyze assess safety . Regular clinical exam realize . All adverse event report accord common terminology criterion adverse event scale . Follow-up period . The patient benefit clinical exam , height , weight , BMI , biological exam ( include albumin , orosomucoid , transthyretin , CRP ) one month end treatment , three month twelve month , late toxicity record . The aim study investigate whether nutritional screening admission use determine risk level adverse clinical event treatment outcome ( full treatment administration ) head neck cancer propose ) isk stratification base nutritional screening radiotherapy concomitant chemo radiotherapy ii ) decisional algorithm placement NGT</detailed_description>
