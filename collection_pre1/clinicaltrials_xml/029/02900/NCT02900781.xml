	<brief_summary>Partial Total Knee Arthroplasty procedures commonly use severe degeneration knee joint due osteoarthritis . With increase number Partial Total Knee Arthroplasty perform population age time amount healthcare dollar allot rehabilitation decline , need develop remote monitoring rehabilitation engage optimize self-management recovery . Current management Partial Total Knee Arthroplasty recovery typically perform out-patient setting highly protocol driven . A typical case might see physical therapist 2-3x/week 8-10 week perform specific exercise monitor progress ( i.e . compliance ROM strengthen exercise ) . One recent study suggest variation patient ' independent exercise activity arthroplasty surgery may contribute variable functional gain . The investigator propose StepRite device develop MedHab , ( shoe insert collect functional data ) reduce cost improve efficacy rehabilitation total knee arthroplasty patient</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Significance study The significance propose study include project benefit patient term attain clinical outcome quicker medical system term manage cost provision service . Subjects expect demonstrate improve compliance patient tailor rehabilitation protocol lead rapid attainment clinical outcome versus present traditional rehabilitation methodology . The expected level , rate , attainment clinical outcome translate overall reduction cost medical system reduce need engage additional process need protract time require attain clinical outcome , either combination increase rehabilitation expenditure . Objectives To compare efficacy StepRite prescribe physical therapy program verse traditional in-facility physical therapy program partial total knee replacement surgery use validate survey tool evaluate patient progress , include patient self -reporting progress surgeon appraisal patient performance post-operatively . To compare overall cost post-operative rehabilitation patient involve traditionally employ regimens versus use StepRite device . Hypothesis specific aim The aim study evaluate whether improved clinical outcome well reduction cost provision care well affect use Steprite device compare use traditional rehabilitation modality . The Investigators seek reject null hypothesis 1 ) difference clinical outcome attain patient use Steprite device use traditional rehabilitation modality 2 ) reduction cost medical system patient use Steprite versus conventional method rehabilitation . By reject null hypothesis investigator accept alternate hypothesis , use Steprite device , patient achieve overall clinical outcome faster associate decrease cost burden medical system difference observe statistically significant compare rehabilitation patient use Steprite device . Patients use device post-surgery demonstrate superior short-term improvement ( i.e . 3 month post surgery ) respect self-reported functional outcome gait parameter , compare control group use device . The patient self-report use validate survey instrument include KOOS survey ( knee injury osteoarthritis outcome score ) , LEFS ( low extremity functional scale ) and/or KSS ( knee society score ) , latter include section surgeon evaluation patient functionality post operatively . Study Design Methods This point care clinical trial ; trial function integrate research within clinical set ability readily deliver either modality proposal . This type study design relies provider referral patient approach consent , randomization one two treatment group facilitate ; control group 15 patient participate conventional rehabilitation regimens experimental group 15 patient participate rehabilitation regimen facilitate use Steprite . Importantly , care patient deliver part current adopt standard utilize outcome measurement , use interpretation already build care provide clinical facility , thereby negate need develop additional outcome measure . Recruitment 30 patient come investigator ' normal patient population , among patient schedule partial total knee arthroplasty . As change post op care patient investigator standard protocol monitor enforcement home protocol , therapist involve investigator ' normal patient care involve arm study . For study , 30 patient represent sample size deem acceptable start point . There publish study use Steprite comparative design trial . Determinations sample size need study , use 80 % power significance 0.05 , incorporate use time frame day week completion rehabilitation protocol would allow detection clinically significant difference group use Steprite use conventional therapy . Given conventional therapy include skilled nursing , home health outpatient visit give need highly variable dependent patient , difficult assign time value determination sample size . With , sample size 30 participant divide two group represent initial start point , potential incremental addition patient order achieve significance two study group . Statistical significance evaluate utilizing standard t-test two group comparison . In preparation study , MedHab Inc. expense train involved investigator therapist fit use StepRite device . Medhab also train lead therapist designate lead investigator charge oversee monitoring , ensure proper use device . There cost patient , hospital funding entity participation study . Medhab LLC assume cost associate training , application , device use StepRite product full course study . Subjects study recruit patient population see investigator 's normal course business . There outside recruitment individual advertise presence use monitoring device entice new patient referral . Prospective candidate ask investigator time designate surgical candidate . All documentation relate study review patient lead physician designee appropriately train discuss patient recruitment . Final decision randomization control StepRite use do part preoperative checkup prior surgery operative consent study consent discuss sign . Randomization : Once patient agrees study would sequentially randomize whether receive StepRite . The patient randomize every eligible patient get intervention . ( ie : 1,3,5,7,9â€¦ get StepRite ; 2,4,6,8 get StepRite ) 15 Intervention subject recruit 15 control subject recruit extra 5 patient account attrition withdrawal .</detailed_description>
