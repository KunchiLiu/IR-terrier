	<brief_title>MED-C Registry : Advanced Malignancy Myelodysplasia , Tested Standard Sequencing Treated Physician Choice</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Every malignancy myelodysplasia different molecular ( genetic ) level even patient diagnosis . These difference often give prognostic information , determine type treatment available patient , well determine outcome . In registry , method identify genetic difference disease ( use Next Generation Sequencing NGS ) standardize , treatment receive patient , outcome treatment enter database identify information remove . Payers ( insurance company ) pay test , laboratory report genetic information , physician eventually patient report treatment outcomes . This information review frequently analyze find good method improve test treatment disease . It expect dozen trial registry eventually available participant .</detailed_description>
