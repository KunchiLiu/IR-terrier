	<detailed_description>Sinusitis common medical problem , significantly decrease patient ' quality life ( QOL ) . Patients may symptoms headache , sinus pressure , nasal congestion drainage , decrease sense smell , malaise . In United States annually , 30 million case sinusitis diagnose occurrence 1 8 adult . The direct medical cost estimate $ 2.4 billion per year indirect cost reach upwards $ 5 billion . Rhinosinusitis describe symptomatic inflammation paranasal sinuses nasal cavity . The term rhinosinusitis prefer sinusitis accompany inflammation contiguous nasal mucosa . Uncomplicated rhinosinusitis define rhinosinusitis without clinically evident extension inflammation outside paranasal sinus nasal cavity time diagnosis ( e.g . neurologic , ophthalmologic , soft tissue involvement ) . Rhinosinusitis may classify duration acute rhinosinusitis ( ARS ) ( &lt; 4 week ' duration ) chronic rhinosinusitis ( CRS ) ( &gt; 12 week ) , without acute exacerbation . This condition resolve spontaneously , often require antibiotic and/or steroid , successful majority patient . Sinus surgery therefore indicate patient whose symptom persist despite conservative medical management . A guideline provide evidence-based recommendation diagnosis management adult sinusitis develop revise panel physician , nurse , healthcare professional support American Academy Otolaryngology - Head Neck Surgery . Surgical therapy sinusitis attempt restore sinus health directly relieve sinus obstruction . Small telescope , call endoscope , place nostril nasal cavity enhance visualization , illumination , magnification sinus adjacent structure . This `` endoscopic sinus surgery '' ( ESS ) technique develop treat four type sinus ( maxillary , frontal , sphenoid , ethmoid ) . The variability involvement sinus vary patient patient . There variety surgical instrument available surgeon ESS stainless steel tool ( shaver , microdebriders , grasp tool ) address sinusitis . Surgical therapy show improve QOL , decrease medication use day miss work subject . The use laser show beneficial several otolaryngological procedure . The LF-40 Gold Laser ( Medical Energy , Inc. ; Pensacola , FL ) already approve clinical use various head neck surgical procedure include functional endoscopic sinus surgery . With use LF-40 Gold Laser , study perform intention compare post-operative outcome sinus surgery perform use microdebrider . The purpose study determine post operative outcome utilize gold laser perform excision concha bullosa , maxillary antrostomy , submucosal cauterization turbinates significantly improve compare use microdebrider sinus surgery . The investigator aim determine treatment outcomes 2 week , 2 month , 6 month postoperatively compare use microdebrider .</detailed_description>
