	<brief_summary>Background : Age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) affect macula eye . This central part retina . It need sharp , clear vision activity like read drive . AMD lead cause vision loss Americans 60 year age old . An advanced form AMD call geographic atrophy GA . It happen light-sensitive cell macula die much central vision decrease . Objective : To learn geographic atrophy associate age-related macular degeneration . Eligibility : Adults least 55 year old certain kind GA . They must enrol study 08-EI-0102 , 08-EI-0169 , 08-EI-0043 , 12-EI-0042 , 11-EI-0147 study . Design : Participants screen medical history , physical exam , eye exam . Participants study visit every 3 month 15 month , every 6 month . They study almost 4 year . Visits last 8 hour . At visit , participant may : Medical eye history . Participants answer question general health eye health . They may answer write question eye problem affect life . Eye exam photograph . Eye pressure measure eye movement check . Pupils dilate drop . The thickness retina measure photo eye may take .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : Age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) , lead cause blindness people age 65 United States , heterogeneous clinical entity retinal degeneration occur predominantly macula context age lead impairment central visual acuity ( VA ) . AMD occur two general form , one involve choroidal neovascularization ( CNV ) subsequent formation disciform scar . This often referred neovascular wet form . A second form , subject study , term dry atrophic macular degeneration otherwise geographic atrophy ( GA ) involve slow progressive atrophy retinal pigment epithelial ( RPE ) cell photoreceptors macula , also result central vision loss . GA estimate affect one million people U.S. current treatment prevent onset retard progression . While etiology GA completely understand , inflammatory process involve activation resident immune cell retina call microglia likely contribute . The objective study study progression GA able characterize quantitative term natural progression GA patient receive directed treatment ; currently approve treatment GA. Study Population : Twenty-five ( 25 ) participant unilateral bilateral GA associate AMD enrol . Design : This prospective , natural history study follow participant GA associate AMD . Outcome Measures : The primary outcome rate change area GA base grade external Reading Center fundus autofluorescence ( FAF ) image assign study eye . The primary outcome calculate 45 month compare baseline . Secondary outcome include change best-corrected visual acuity ( BCVA ) , rate change area GA base fundus photography development exudative AMD ascertain use optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) change macular sensitivity .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Participant must 55 year age old . 2 . Participant must understand sign protocol inform consent document . 3 . Participant must evidence early intermediate AMD define characteristic presence drusen and/or pigmentary change . 4 . Participant enrol one follow screening protocol : 08EI0102 , 08EI0169 , 08EI0043 , 12EI0042 , 11EI0147 . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : A participant eligible follow exclusion criterion present . 1 . Participant actively receive study therapy another investigational study . 2 . Participant unable comply study procedure followup visit . 3 . Participant ocular systemic medication know toxic lens , retina optic nerve ( e.g. , ethambutol , chloroquine , hydroxychloroquine ) . Study Eye Eligibility Criteria The participant must least one eye meeting inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion list . Study Eye Inclusion Criteria 1 . The study eye ( ) must GA compatible dry AMD . GA define one welldefined often circular patch partial complete depigmentation RPE , typically exposure underlie choroidal blood vessel . Even much RPE appear preserve large choroidal vessel visible , round patch RPE partial depigmentation may classify early GA . The GA study eye must able photographed entirety must contiguous area peripapillary atrophy , complicate area measurement . 2 . The study eye ( ) must clarity ocular medium degree pupil dilation sufficient permit adequate fundus photograph . Study Eye Exclusion Criteria 1 . Current evidence neovascularization determine treat physician history treatment neovascularization . 2 . Evidence retinal atrophy due cause atrophic AMD . 3 . Current evidence history ocular disorder study eye might confound study outcome measure , include ( limited ) : 1. nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy involve 10 hemorrhage microaneurysms , active proliferative diabetic retinopathy 2 . Branch central retinal vein artery occlusion 3 . Macular hole 4 . Pathologic myopia 5 . Uveitis 6 . Pseudovitelliform maculopathy 4 . History vitreoretinal surgery 5 . Need ocular surgery course study 6 . Recent history lens removal ( &lt; 3 month prior enrollment ) Yttrium Aluminum Garnet ( YAG ) laser capsulotomy ( &lt; 1 month prior enrollment )</criteria>
