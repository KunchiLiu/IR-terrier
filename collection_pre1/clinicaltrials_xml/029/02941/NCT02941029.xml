	<brief_summary>This research study do develop new test identify prostate cancer patient high risk radiotherapy-related complication . This research study would allow monitoring total tissue damage within 24 hour radiation exposure blood sample could give initial result within day would help clinician make treatment decision . Detection unusual tissue damage early time , well symptom occur , could allow doctor tailor intervention could include patient therapy would reduce prevent problem occur due treatment cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>RADTOX : Measuring Radiation Toxicity Using Circulating DNA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently , patient 's risk toxicity base almost exclusively population statistic . Radiation ( chemotherapy ) dose base phase I data individual 's specific genetics hidden predisposition . RadTox measure cell damage within 24 hour radiation exposure help identify patient high risk radiation complication . This allow physician adjust radiation field size dose minimize long-term toxicity . Patients undergo radiation treatment stage I III prostate cancer , use proton X-rays , either primary treatment consolidation prostatectomy ( positive margin prostate-specific assay [ PSA ] -related indication ) eligible . Hormone treatment allow .</detailed_description>
