	<brief_summary>The purpose study : 1 . To establish set diagnostic criterion intraoperative frozen section early stage lung adenocarcinoma , include clinicopathologic molecular characteristic . 2 . To assess clinical usefulness guide surgical procedure early stage lung adenocarcinoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Precision Diagnosis Intraoperative Frozen Section Early Stage Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The detection rate small pulmonary nodule increase due widespread use high-resolution compute tomography ( CT ) screen clinical practice . These minute pulmonary nodule suggestive atypical adenomatous hyperplasia ( AHH ) , adenocarcinoma situ ( AIS ) , minimally invasive adenocarcinoma ( MIA ) , invasive adenocarcinoma . Hence , precision diagnosis intraoperative frozen section particularly imperative fundamental role ass indeterminate lung lesion guide extent subsequent surgical procedure . However , still difficult surgical pathologist apply various feature accord newly revise WHO classification lung adenocarcinoma ( 2015 ) guide surgical management due unascertained accuracy heterogeneity lung cancer technique problem . Therefore , establishment assessment set diagnostic criterion intraoperative frozen section early stage lung adenocarcinoma primary aim study .</detailed_description>
