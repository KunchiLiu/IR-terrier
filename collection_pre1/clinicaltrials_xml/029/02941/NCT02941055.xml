	<detailed_description>Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) chronic inflammatory disease affect 0.5-1 % population , many patient spite modern pharmacological treatment fail reach remission . This affect physical well mental wellbeing lead severely reduce quality life reduce work capacity , thus yield high individual well societal cost . To optimize treatment , alternative diet evaluated complement pharmacological treatment . The main goal randomize cross-over trial ADIRA ( Anti-inflammatory Diet In Rheumatoid Arthritis ) test hypothesis diet intervention decrease disease activity cost improve quality life patient establish RA . In total , 60 RA patient moderate disease activity randomize receive initially either portfolio diet base several food item suggest anti-inflammatory effect control diet ( western type ) , 2 x 3 month 3 month wash-out diet . Both group continue regular pharmacological treatment . Known food biomarkers analyze measure intervention compliance . Impact disease activity ( measure DAS28 , composite score predicts disability progression RA ) quality life evaluate diet regimen . Metabolomics use evaluate potential predict responder dietary treatment . ADIRA provide evidence whether dietary treatment RA lead patient reach remission improve quality life work capacity well reduce individual societal cost . Scientific evidence exist anti-inflammatory effect single food RA , study exists food combine obtain maximum effect thus potential offer substantial improvement patient life quality . Such evidence ask RA patent well treat physician .</detailed_description>
