	<detailed_description>The AiM-PD study recruit 20 patient ( 10 GBA-positive &amp; 10 GBA-negative status ) diagnose Parkinson disease ( PD ) . Each patient self-administer study drug , ambroxol ( 60 mg per tablet ) 5 intra-dose escalation course 6 month , show : 1 . Day 1-7 : 60 mg 2 . Day 8-14 : 120 mg 3 . Day 15-21 : 180 mg 4 . Day 22-28 : 300 mg 5 . Day 29-186 : 420 mg The study drug license EU over-the-counter drug treat respiratory condition reduce mucus production . Previous study show ambroxol penetrate brain rodent non-human primate model , may effect slow PD . The result also indicate individual express GBA mutation ( increase risk PD ) able reduce growth cell cause PD stimulate enzyme call glucocerebrosidase . The study collect cerebrospinal fluid , blood , urine sample , drug take 6 month period . In sample Investigators measure ambroxol drug level , assess whether glucocerebrosidase enzyme stimulate level substance thought associate development PD confirm whether study drug penetrate cerebrospinal fluid CNS . The study administer clinical cognitive assessment determine improvement patient 's PD symptom . If study prof ambroxol penetrates CNS replicate current finding laboratory , Investigators shall move much large drug trial test whether study drug may able slow progression PD .</detailed_description>
