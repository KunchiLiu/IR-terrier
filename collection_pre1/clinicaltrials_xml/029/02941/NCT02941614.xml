	<brief_summary>Many breast cancer patient experience psychological distress cancer care journey . There effective treatment breast cancer patient experience distress , individual group therapy , health education , medication . Unfortunately , clinician may aware symptom distress breast cancer patient , breast cancer patient could benefit referral behavioral health specialist overlook . New guideline recommend cancer patient regularly screen distress . However , unanswered question impact distress screen conduct large scale . Few study evaluate impact distress screen important outcome breast cancer patient , patient experience , symptom management , use health care service , compare usual care offer health care organization . In addition , oncology clinician uncertain benefit large-scale distress screening , pilot screen program uniformly successful , particularly community oncology set . The overarch goal study assess effectiveness implement guideline-recommended distress screen program newly diagnose breast cancer patient improve identification referral treatment highly distressed breast cancer patient , assess patient-reported outcome , health service utilization , implementation outcome program . This study address two main research question : 1 ) Is community-oncology base , large-scale distress screen program effective usual care improve identification distress patient , referral behavioral health service , patient-reported outcome breast cancer patient ? 2 ) What barrier , facilitator , implementation-related outcome related distress screen community oncology set ?</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Study Aims : Breast cancer patient risk physical psychosocial harm . Among highly prevalent psychosocial issue breast cancer patient psychological distress . Distress define assessed psychiatric morbidity prevalence psychiatric disorder , particularly anxiety depression . It estimate 40-50 % woman diagnose early stage breast cancer experience distress year follow diagnosis . There rich literature persistent negative effect distress breast cancer patient , include association decrease physical social functioning , increase symptom burden , high utilization inpatient emergency service , poor quality life . Psychological distress also adversely affect individual work productivity , contribute rise cost cancer care . Recent guideline American Society Clinical Oncology ( ASCO ) others recommend routine distress screen breast cancer patient , recognize availability effective treatment psychological distress . Unfortunately distress remain under-detected undertreated breast cancer patient rate adherence ASCO guideline low . Low rate screen might explain part limited evidence effectiveness : efficacy distress screen demonstrate small-scale trial academic center , typically show increase number referral psychosocial service , evidence support effectiveness large scale distress screen program routine practice condition limit . It currently unknown distress screen breast cancer patient improve identification distressed patient referral behavioral health service non-academic setting . In addition , extant efficacy study generally fail measure key impact outcomes desire distress screening , patient-reported outcome ( e.g. , distress management , satisfaction ) change health care utilization ( e.g. , change emergency department use ) . Implementation-related factor outcome also largely overlooked prior research ( e.g. , clinician acceptability , fidelity delivery ) , leave serious gap understand barrier adoption distress screen program gap knowledge need facilitate large-scale , routine implementation screening . The overarch goal study implement evaluate guideline-based distress screen program newly diagnose breast cancer patient , measure effectiveness impact key outcome examine barrier facilitator routine adoption . There critical need translational research ass effectiveness distress screen program improve ( ) identification distress , ( b ) referral service , ( c ) outcomes breast cancer patient real-world oncology setting , understand implementation barrier facilitator . Without evidence effectiveness , unlikely clinical operational health system leader invest distress screen program , potentially lead serious adverse consequence . This propose translational research crucial order bridge gap academic study non-academic , community oncology practice , majority breast cancer patient treat . In addition , gain insight understand barrier facilitator implementation distress screen program critically important . The objective assess effectiveness recommended screen program joint task force American Psychosocial Oncology Society , Association Oncology Social Work , Oncology Nursing Society improve identification referral treatment highly distressed breast cancer patient within integrated health care system , assess patient-reported outcome , health service utilization , implementation outcome program . Specific Aims : Aim 1 : Evaluate effectiveness guideline-recommended distress screen program breast cancer patient improve identification distress patient , initiation completion referral behavioral health , patient-reported utilization outcome compare usual care within Kaiser Permanente Southern California ( KPSC ) , use pragmatic cluster randomize control trial design six medical center . Aim 2 : Identify patient- , clinician- , system-level barrier facilitator implementation program , assess stakeholder-perceived acceptability , fidelity , achievements program . Study Methods The setting research Kaiser Permanente Southern California , large , integrated health care system 14 medical center serve highly diverse population 4 million member . The investigator use novel hybrid effectiveness-implementation study design allow dual study clinical effectiveness implementation-related factor address need evidence area . This study employ mixed method , collect qualitative quantitative data appropriate address study aim . To evaluate effectiveness , study use cluster randomize control trial ( RCT ) design , cluster medical center level , implement program intervention sit offer screen newly diagnose breast cancer patient . To evaluate effectiveness program , investigator collect structure data KPSC electronic record ( referral initiation/completion , use health service ) patient-reported data ( functioning , symptom management ) . Existing work pilot primary care-based distress screen program leverage research , demonstrate feasibility study . Implementation outcome assess qualitative survey data . Knowledge gain research use inform continue development implementation systematic distress screen program breast cancer patient , enrich evidence base provide critical information relevant patient- system-level outcome . These result impact quality life quality care patient , directly influence distress screen program adoption , scale-up , spread , make work highly relevant breast cancer patient throughout California across nation .</detailed_description>
