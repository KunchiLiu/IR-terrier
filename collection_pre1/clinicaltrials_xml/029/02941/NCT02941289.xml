	<brief_summary>The aim understand component attentional deployment selection impair AD search realistic scene computer screen ( Experiment 1 ) natural setting ( Experiment 2 ) .The investigator also examine deficit visual exploration may relate impairment semantic , long-term memory ( LTM ) work memory ( WM ) representation manipulate semantic consistency target visual surroundings , type target cue ( abstract vs. precise ) , respectively . Perceptual saliency target distractor object also manipulate Expt.1 , In Expt.2 , order determine deficit visual exploration may involve IADL deficit show AD patient , participant trial require search natural setting different type target perform IADL use five object , among one search target . Measures analyse : search task ( Expt . 1 2 ) : eye movement different search phase , accuracy response time ; IADLs task ( Expt . 2 ) : eye movement action planning execution , motor efficiency ( number type action perform ) , time terminate activity . Compared control , investigator expect AD patient reduce ability use scene semantic LTM order locate object , great attentional capture highly salient feature great search performance impairment high WM resource require ( abstract target cue ) . The investigator also expect performance IADLs less efficient , particular , less organize control , reduce advantage eye guidance .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It well establish visual attention decline early Alzheimer 's Disease ( AD ) . Little known visual search AD , particular relation functional autonomy . The crucial role parietal cortex visuospatial attention instrumental activity daily live ( IADLs ) , presence early parietal damage AD suggest IADLs may also impair early . The aim understand component attentional deployment selection specifically impaired AD searching static realistic scene present computer screen ( Experiment 1 ) natural setting ( Experiment 2 : different region room , furnished different type object indicate different possible daily-living environment , like kitchen office ) . More precisely , investigator examine deficit visual exploration search target object may relate impairment semantic , long-term memory ( LTM ) work memory ( WM ) representation manipulate , respectively , semantic consistency target type visual surrounding ( scene context , Expt . 1 , type co-occurring object , Expt 2 ) .and type prior information supply target object ( abstract - i.e. , verbal - precise , - i.e. , pictorial ) , In Expt . 1 investigator also manipulate perceptual salience ( low-level feature : luminance , colour , orientation , etc . ) target distractor object within scene . Second , determine deficit visual exploration search specific object may involve deficit IADL AD , investigator analyse search behaviour natural setting , require location three different target ( semantically consistent/related IADL , semantically consistent/ non-related IADL , semantically inconsistent/non-related ) . The investigator require participant perform IADL search ( four trial total ) use , among four object , IADL-related search target ) . In Expt . 1 investigator test three group participant : AD group ( early stage disease ) , match control group healthy elderly people control group young , healthy individual . The investigator examine search performance ( accuracy response time ) oculomotor behaviour different search phase ( initiation , scene scanning , target verification ) . They expect AD patient reduce search performance compare control group , also reflect reduced oculomotor efficiency overall search process . Moreover , hypothesize patient less able use semantic memory type scene order locate target ( reduced benefit scene consistency ) , strongly disadvantage case high WM load ( abstract target cue ) , finally , influence perceptual , low-level factor ( strong effect salience ) . In Exp . 2 , test AD group control group healthy , match , old control . With respect search task , analyse effect target semantic consistency , target relatedness IADL type target cue ( abstract vs. precise ) . In , consider search performance ( accuracy response time ) oculomotor behaviour search term order number object fixate , duration fixation . With respect IADLs , analyse eye guidance current action efficiency whole IADL term type number action perform time perform overall activity . They expect pattern eye movement AD patient similar search IADLs , numerous intrusion distractors frequent reselections object . Moreover , expect performance IADLs less efficient control , term action speed organisation . The use natural setting analysis spontaneous oculomotor behavior patient improve ecological validity research attentional deficit AD . This study also contribute innovative solution diagnosis treatment , help research subjective change attention visuospatial function AD</detailed_description>
