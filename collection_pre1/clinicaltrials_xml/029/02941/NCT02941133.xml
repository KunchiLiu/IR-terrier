	<brief_title>Comparison Neural Mobilization Techniques Standard Care Treatment Patients With Lumbar Radiculitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Radicular pain regard distinct pain entity pathophysiology differs somatic refer pain nociceptive pain . Radicular lumbar pain describes sensitize nerve root lumbar spine peripheral nerve trunk capable produce pain ( usually knee ) and/or symptom absence true nerve tissue damage . This type pain evoke ectopic discharge stem lumbar dorsal roots ganglion . The common cause type pain inflammatory environment produce substance contain herniated material injure lumbar intervertebral disc . It suggest patient present functional ( e.g . mechanosensitivity ) structural nerve root problem , identify screen classified discrete group patient benefit specific neural mobilization technique . Neural mobilization technique gain considerable amount attention amongst therapists researcher assessment treatment painful condition occasionally involve neural element pathophysiology lumbar radicular pain . Studies explore effect neural mobilization technique patient lumbar radicular pain generally show good result lack adequate sample size methodological quality . The aim study compare effectiveness neural mobilization technique standard care physiotherapy treatment ( ultrasound , general exercise , massage therapy , transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation ) patient lumbar radiculitis . Participants : Patients low back pain radiates low limb . Patients satisfy inclusion criterion screen classified another researcher distinct group lumbar radiculitis . Another researcher take baseline measurement patient sub-group randomly assign receive either neural mobilization standard care physiotherapy treatment . Both group receive total 10 treatment twice per week 5 week . Patients assess use specific outcome measure prior treatment ( baseline ) , 5 week ( post treatment ) 6 month treatment . Statistical analysis : Data analyse Statistical Package Social Sciences ( SPSS ) , version 22 . Intension treat analysis apply . A two-way mixed-model analysis variance use outcome measure , treatment group ( neural mobilization standard care treatment ) between-subject variable time ( baseline , 1 month follow , six month follow ) within-subject variable . Comparison baseline demographic characteristic analyse use t-tests continuous variable chi square test categorical variable .</detailed_description>
