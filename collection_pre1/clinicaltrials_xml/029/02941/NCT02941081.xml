	<brief_title>A Novel Nano-iron Supplement Safely Combat Iron Deficiency Anaemia Young Children : Doubleblind Randomised Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective trial : ( ) show non-inferiority IHAT compare ferrous sulphate efficacy ( term Hb iron deficiency correction ) ; ( ii ) show superiority IHAT compare ferrous sulphate term moderate-severe diarrhoea ( incidence prevalence ) ; ( iii ) show non-inferiority IHAT compare placebo term prevalence moderate-severe diarrhoea . Secondary objective : ( ) show IHAT supplementation increase enteric pathogen burden ; ( ii ) show IHAT supplementation non-detrimental gut microbiome ; ( iii ) show IHAT supplementation cause intestinal inflammation ; ( iv ) describe impact IHAT supplementation hospitalisation morbidity ; ( v ) determine effect IHAT supplementation systemic inflammation ; ( vi ) determine effect IHAT supplementation systemic marker iron handle . To investigate primary secondary objective investigator conduct 3-arm , parallel , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled , phase 2 , clinical trial . Participants iron deficient anaemic young child live rural community North Bank Upper River Division The Gambia . The community health centre within study catchment area ( Wuli Sandu district ) sensitise study . Young child identify use immunisation record health centre . At screening , mothers/guardians child sign informed consent form , child physically examine study nurse , child consider generally healthy , height weight measure finger prick blood sample collect Hb RDT test . If z-scores &gt; -3 , 7 ≤Hb &lt; 11 g/dL RDT negative , small venous blood sample collect confirm Hb level determine serum ferritin . A total 705 eligible child randomise 3 study arm ( n=235 per arm ) . In study arm , child supplement daily 12 week ( 84 day ) either placebo , ferrous sulphate IHAT . Blood stool sample collect baseline ( Day 0 ) day 14 day 84 intervention period . Following 12 week intervention additional active follow-up period 4 week without intervention . Highly train experienced field worker visit child every day 12 week supplementation period order administer iron supplement placebo occasion check child 's general health actively look sign malaria co-infections . If child show sign infection , field worker refer study nurse perform adequate test child offer appropriate treatment/referral next health center . Three time per week , morbidity data ( include question regard fever , diarrhoea , vomit , cough , illness , appetite mediation take assessment body temperature ) capture . Every week child screen use finger prick blood sample determine malaria Hb status child find positive RDT study test blood film treat accord national guideline . These visit continue 4 week post intervention follow-up AE/SAEs . Any child Hb fall 7 g/dL follow-up study period stop study refer next health centre management provide iron supplement 3 consecutive month accord national WHO guideline . These child treat data analysis treatment failure . At end follow-up period ( 12+4 week ) , child arm still anaemia ( Hb &lt; 11 g/dL ) provide iron supplementation 3 consecutive month per national WHO guideline .</detailed_description>
