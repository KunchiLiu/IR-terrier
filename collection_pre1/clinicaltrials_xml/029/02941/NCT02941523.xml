	<brief_title>Safety , PK Efficacy NOX66 Monotherapy Combined With Carboplatin Refractory Solid Tumours</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Idronoxil synthetic small molecule pre-clinical study identify strong candidate development chemo-sensitising drug . Human study use idronoxil administer oral intravenous dosage form show drug highly susceptible Phase 2 metabolism , result loss bio-activity . NOX66 idronoxil new dosage formulation develop specifically protect drug Phase 2 metabolism thereby ensure retention majority administer drug bio-active form . The main purpose current study confirm safety new dosage formula monotherapy combination carboplatin , give anticipated drug present body bio-active form considerably high level previously achieve . A secondary objective observe NOX66 able restore response carboplatin tumour consider unresponsive chemotherapy , moreover provide meaningful clinical benefit combination lower-than-normal dosage carboplatin . Patients draw 5 cancer type : prostate cancer , lung cancer , breast cancer , ovarian cancer , head neck cancer . The study commence Phase 1a ( Run-in ) arm compare relative tolerability safety two different dosage idronoxil/NOX66 14-day monotherapy course . Providing dose limiting toxicity ( DLT ) , patient progress onto Phase 1b ( Combination ) arm study , remain dosage . In arm , patient receive 6 treatment cycle , 28 day comprise NOX66 ( idronoxil ) treatment Days 1-7 carboplatin Day 2 treatment cycle . Any meaningful clinical response occur Phase 1b ( Combination ) Arm trigger Phase IIa ( Combination ) Arm additional 10 patient recruit maximum 2 cohort tumour type ( prostate , lung , breast , ovarian , head neck ) . These patient receive combination dosage provide observed clinical response treat dosage maximum 6 treatment cycle .</detailed_description>
