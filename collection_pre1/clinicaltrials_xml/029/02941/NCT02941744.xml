	<brief_title>A Clinical Trial : Adjuvant Low-dose Ipilimumab + Nivolumab After Resection Melanoma Macrometastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently , standard care available treatment subject AJCC Stage IIIb/c Stage IV NED melanoma high risk recurrence follow complete resection metastasis . Ipilimumab ( 10mg/kg ) , interferon , pegylated interferon therapy observation alone typical option Stage III patient achieve complete resection Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve . In EU , high-dose interferon approve drug adjuvant treatment melanoma patient . Given unexceptional benefit high toxicity profile patient population free disease , controversial whether ipilimumab interferon consider standard care Stage III melanoma . Nivolumab , PD1 block monoclonal antibody , show superior anti-tumor activity across wide range dose-levels ( 0,1 10 mg/kg every 2 week ) patient advanced melanoma . Nivolumab ( dose 3 mg/kg every 3 week ) demonstrate survival benefit treatment naive patient BRAF Wild Type ( WT ) , metastatic melanoma Phase 3 , randomize clinical trial PFS benefit ipilimumab first-line therapy advance melanoma . Combination therapy ipilimumab nivolumab result higher response rate PFS compare result obtain monotherapy . Combination therapy however significantly increase incidence grade &gt; 3 adverse event , extent regimen would probably associate unacceptable toxicity adjuvant setting . The toxicity seem driven Ipilimumab . The adverse event see Ipilimumab dose dependent . Unlike PD-1 blockade , CTLA-4 blockade diversifies peripheral T-cell pool , represent pharmacodynamic effect measure DNA-sequencing technology refer ImmunoSeq . This phase IB study investigate effect low-dose ipilimumab low-dose nivolumab peripheral T-cell repertoire patient free disease follow resection melanoma macrometastases . Treatment low-dose ipilimumab combination low-dose nivolumab safe modify peripheral T-cell repertoire subject completely resect Stage IIIb/c Stage IV melanoma high risk recurrence . Ipilimumab ( YervoyTM , BMS ) , human IgG-1 anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody improve survival patient advance melanoma .Adjuvant therapy ipilimumab improve relapse-free survival complete resection high-risk stage III melanoma . Combined treatment ipilimumab plus nivolumab improves tumor response rate overall survival patient advance melanoma associate high incidence immune related adverse event . Nivolumab ipilimumab distinct immunological mechanism reveal analyze TCR usage blood lymphocyte .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All subject must either Stage IIIb/c Stage IV AJCC ( 7th edition ) histologically confirm melanoma completely surgically resect order eligible . Subjects must surgically render free disease negative margin resect specimen . Please refer Appendix 1 description AJCC 7th edition TNM staging . If Stage III melanoma ( whether Stage IIIb IIIc ) subject must clinically detectable lymph node confirm malignant pathology report Clinically detectable lymph node define : A palpable node ( confirm malignant pathology ) A nonpalpable enlarged lymph node CT ( least 15 mm short axis ) confirm malignant pathology A PET positive lymph node size confirm pathology Evidence pathologically macrometastatic disease one lymph node define one focus melanoma least 1cm diameter All melanoma , except ocular/uveal melanoma , regardless primary site disease allow Complete resection Stage III disease document surgical pathology report complete resection Stage IV disease margin negative document pathology report . Complete resection must perform within 16 week prior recruitment Subjects must receive systemic medical anticancer treatment ( postsurgical local/locoregional radiation therapy apply accord local standard practice allow ) All subject must diseasefree status document complete physical examination total body PET/CT image within 4 week prior recruitment . ECOG performance status score 0 1 ( Appendix 2 ) In order recruit , tumor tissue resect site disease must provide biomarker analysis . If insufficient tumor tissue content provide analysis , acquisition additional archive tumor tissue ( block /or slide ) biomarker analysis require . Prior treated central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases must without MRI evidence recurrence least 4 week treatment , subject must immunosuppressive dos systemic steroid ( &gt; 10 mg/day equivalent ) least 14 day prior study drug administration , must return neurologic baseline postoperatively . The 4week period stability measure completion neurologic intervention , ie surgery and/or radiation In addition neurosurgery treat CNS metastasis , adjuvant radiation resection CNS metastasis allow . Immunosuppressive dos systemic steroid ( dos &lt; 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent ) must discontinue least 14 day study drug administration Prior surgery require general anesthesia must complete least 4 week study drug administration . Surgery require local/epidural anesthesia must complete least 72 hour study drug administration . All baseline laboratory requirement assess obtain within 14 day recruitment . Screening laboratory value must meet following criterion : i. WBCs &gt; 2000/μL ii . Neutrophils &gt; 1500/μL iii . Lymphocytes &gt; 1000/μL iv . Platelets &gt; 100 x 10³/μL v. Hemoglobin &gt; 9.0 g/dL vi . Creatinine Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) creatinine clearance &gt; 40 mL/minute ( use Cockcroft/Gault formula ) vii . AST &lt; ULN viii . ALT &lt; ULN ix . Total Bilirubin &lt; 1 x ULN ( except subject Gilbert Syndrome must total bilirubin &lt; 3.0 mg/dL ) x. LDH &lt; 1,5x ULN xi . CRP &lt; 2x ULN Subjects leptomeningeal metastasis History ocular/uveal melanoma Medical History Concurrent Diseases Subjects previous nonmelanoma malignancy exclude unless complete remission achieve least 3 year prior study entry additional therapy require anticipate required study period ( exception include limited , nonmelanoma skin cancer ; situ bladder cancer , situ gastric cancer , situ colon cancer ; situ cervical cancers/dysplasia ; breast carcinoma situ ) Subjects active , know , suspect autoimmune disease . Subjects type I diabetes mellitus , residual hypothyroidism due autoimmune thyroiditis require hormone replacement , skin disorder ( vitiligo , psoriasis , alopecia ) require systemic treatment permit enroll . For case uncertainty , recommend BMS medical monitor consult prior sign inform consent . Subjects condition require systemic treatment either corticosteroid ( &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent ) immunosuppressive medication within 14 day study drug administration . Inhaled topical steroid permit absence active autoimmune disease . Prior therapy melanoma except surgery melanoma lesion ( ) except adjuvant RT neurosurgical resection CNS lesion . Specifically subject receive prior therapy interferon , antiPD1 , antiPDL1 , antiPDL2 , antiCD137 , antiCTLA4 antibody ( include ipilimumab antibody drug specifically target T cell costimulation checkpoint pathway ) eligible . Treatment direct resect melanoma ( eg , chemotherapy , target agent , biotherapy , limb perfusion ) administer complete resection . Any serious uncontrolled medical disorder active infection , opinion investigator , may increase risk associate study participation , study drug administration , would impair ability subject receive protocol therapy . Physical Laboratory Test Findings Positive test hepatitis B virus surface antigen ( HBVsAg ) hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid ( HCV RNA ) indicate acute chronic infection . Known history test positive human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) know acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . Allergies Adverse Drug Reaction History Grade ≥3 allergy humanize monoclonal antibody Other Exclusion Criteria Prisoners subject involuntarily incarcerate Subjects compulsorily detain treatment either psychiatric physical ( eg , infectious disease ) illness Pregnant nursing woman Psychological , familial , sociological , geographical condition potentially hamper compliance study protocol followup schedule ; condition discuss subject registration trial</criteria>
