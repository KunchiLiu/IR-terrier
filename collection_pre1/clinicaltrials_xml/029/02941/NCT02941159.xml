Potential study participant screen eligibility participate study . All study participant receive counsel pertain intent participate study qualify counselor research team . Written inform consent validate PI designee obtain participant . Forty five ( 45 ) healthy male recruit study . Method assign study participant treatment arm/group : The blocked randomization method use allocate participant treatment . Selection participant treatment base rank 45 randomly generate number size 0 1 , generate sequential participant . Accordingly , participant block 3 rank accord random number . In block participant high rank allocate treatment A , one second high allocate treatment B , one third high allocated treatment C. A randomization list participant Identification ( ID ) number generate statistician kept PI . Treatment pack bear participant ID number . Only PI know treatment allocation . Drug administration : Participants start take dose orally respective treatment arm recruitment study complete . In order ensure study drug take , Directly Observed Treatment ( DOT ) approach use . The study drug administer twice daily 06.00hrs - 09.00hrs 17.00hrs - 20.00hrs six week . All administration record dose sheet sign person administer treatment Co-PI Medical Doctor . Data Collection : The participant require report adverse event immediately . At visit , participant also interview adverse event since previous visit . Furthermore , participant require keep dairy adverse event duration study . The laboratory test mainly carried Tropical Diseases Research Centre ( Ndola ) , Ndola Central Hospital ( Ndola ) . The frequency data collection point screen , baseline week 1 , 3 , 6 8 . Screening : Week -2 -1 - Demographic Data counselling : Demographic data record counsel session HIV testing initiate . - Informed consent : After in-depth interview , one study nurse participant ask document consent signing informed consent . The sign informed consent must obtain test evaluation relate study carry . - Vital Signs : axillary temperature , blood pressure , respiratory rate pulse , height weight measure . - Medical history Physical Clinical Examination : The medical history potential participant general physical examination perform . - Laboratory Tests : HIV , HBV HCV testing , malaria microscopy , Urinalysis - dipstix , Blood hemoglobin , full blood count differential , liver renal function test perform . - Discharge : Participant discharge ask report one day 06:00 hour assessment eligibility criterion . Enrolment study drug administration visit : Week 0 - Vital sign Vital sign measure - Enrolment The Co-PI Medical Doctor ass eligibility criterion . Eligible participant Karnofsky score 100 % ( Appendix XI ) The eligible candidate receive ID number send study nurse medication . Non-eligible potential participant refer accordingly . - Medication Study drug administer use DOT strategy - Adverse event discharge Any adverse event record , detail see appendix Discharge thirty minute form time drug administer Follow period : Week 1 6 - Adverse Events Report All adverse event record . Use appendix IV check adverse effect - Concomitant Medications Any medication take study include traditional medicine subject record . - Vital Signs Vital sign measure - Physical Clinical Examination A general physical examination clinical examination perform - Laboratory test : HIV , HBV HCV testing , malaria microscopy , Urinalysis - dipstix , Blood hemoglobin , full blood count differential , liver renal function test perform . - Treatment Study drug administer ; information medication document include information concomitant medication give management adverse event . - Unscheduled visit throughout follow visit , procedure apply . Any laboratory study specific measurement perform , accord physician 's clinical judgement . Data Entry : The data generate entered analyzed STATA computer software . Statistical Analysis : Null Hypothesis set p-values The SF2000SD herbal preparation safe human consumption P-value = 0.05 . The adverse event classify three five category ( Adverse event category three `` treatment '' ) . Proportions compare use Chi-square test . If expect frequency less 5 % , Fisher 's test use . The student ' test use compare mean . The level statistical significance set 5 % . The clinical finding also classify three five category exact chi-square test do . If null hypothesis ( association occurrence adverse event physical examination finding exact chi-square test difference change analysis variance test ) exact Chi-square test analysis variance test reject multiple comparison test stratify analysis do compare placebo treatment . Conduct interim analysis week 3 study start baseline ( baseline time 45 participant possible - must include randomization ) . QUALITY CONTROL : The Investigators review consent screening process study stuff prior commencement study ensure standardize approach follow study . In addition , Investigators frequently conduct performance assessment study support staff ensure smooth collection reliable data review participant ' concern study . In addition study monitor visit initiation , conduct study closure verify study conduct compliance , Protocol/amendment ( ) , Good Clinical Practices , Standard Operating Procedures ( SOPs ) applicable regulatory requirement . PROCEDURES TO HANDLE ADVERSE EVENTS : At admission treatment period study participant instruct report change normal health experience Principal Investigator Co-Principal Investigator . AEs also elicit indirect question regular interval , usually time measurement vital sign , question `` How feel today ? `` Is anything bother ? '' No study participant shall permit medication study except permit study medical doctor . All AEs symptom record CRF . Any SAE report Principal Investigator/Co- Principal Investigator , within 48 hour ( 0977 655096 0966 263271 ) , turn report Ethics Committee DSMB .
