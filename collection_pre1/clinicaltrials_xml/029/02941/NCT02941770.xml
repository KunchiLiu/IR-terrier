	<detailed_description>Secondary objectives The success adolescent obesity management assess base BMI/BMI z-score PA level . Thus , secondary objective study : ( ) Analyze effect intervention cardiorespiratory fitness ( CRF ) . CRF commonly express VO2 max represent ability uptake , deliver , use oxygen produce energy . CRF inversely associate BMI waist circumference , potential beneficial effect endothelial function structure - know impaired among overweight adolescent - even without occurrence major change BMI . ( ii ) Analyze effect intervention biochemical marker , include insulin resistance lipid profile . ( iii ) Analyze whether change BMI z-score , PA/sedentary behavior CRF associate change endothelial structural health ( assess trough carotid intima-media thickness - cIMT ) function ( assess trough pulse wave velocity - PWV ) . ( iv ) Validate sub-maximal exercise step test overweight adolescent population future use PA consultation routine . Sub-maximal exercise step test consider timely cost-effective method assess CRF , conduct clinical office minimal risk discomfort participant compare maximal exercise testing . ( v ) Analyze cost-effectiveness ( CE ) intervention , since consider important aid public health decision-making , extra potential additional value tertiary health care set . Data collection method Socio-economic status Social-economic classification ( SES ) base parents/caregivers occupation , accord Portuguese National Institute Statistics . The socio-occupational status parents/caregivers categorize three group : ( ) management position ( Class I ) ; ( ii ) office , service skilled manual worker ( Class II III ) ; ( iii ) unskilled worker unemployed ( Classe IV V ) . Anthropometry The anthropometric assessment perform exercise physiologist office outpatient clinic , Department Pediatrics , HSM . All assessment perform investigator . With exception body composition , anthropometric assessment perform twice confirmation procedure . The Technical Error Measurement ( TEM ) calculate accordingly : TEM=√ [ ∑Dif2/2n ] ) . ( ) Height ( height stadiometer , SECA 217 , Hamburg , Germany ) assess anthropometric position , without shoe , participant back stadiometer , expiratory phase . Height register near 0.1 cm ; ( ii ) Body weight body composition ( bioelectrical impedance scale InBody 230 , Seoul , Korea ) . Body weight measure near 0.1 kg , anthropometric position ( palm turn thigh ) , subject wear clothes possible , without shoe sock ; ( iii ) BMI calculate body weight kilogram divide square height meter [ BMI= weight ( kg ) /height2 ( ) ] . We calculate BMI z-score [ BMI z-score= [ ( BMI/M ( ) ) L ( ) -1 ] /L ( ) S ( ) ] , since acknowledge best choice track change grow child ; ( iv ) Waist hip circumference ( circumference measuring tape , SECA 203 , Hamburg , Germany ) measure subject standing . Waist circumference measure 1 cm iliac crest end regular expiration , hip circumference maximum protuberance buttock . Body Composition ( Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry ) Additionally bioelectrical impedance , usual assessment clinical office , body composition assess DXA ( Explorer W , Hologic ; Waltham , MA , USA ) analyze use equipment 's software ( QDR 12.4 , Waltham , MA , USA ) . DXA exam perform accordance National Health Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) protocol . Trunk Whole Body Fat , well Trunk Whole Body Peripheral Fat assess . All procedure perform investigator . All scan make morning overnight feasting ( 10-12 hour ) . Clinical assessment ( ) Pubertal status assess pediatrician categorize accordance Tanner stage . ( ii ) Resting blood pressure ( digital sphygmomanometer , CAS 9302S , CAS Medical Systems , Branford , USA ) measure right arm appropriate size cuff , five minute rest seat position . The measurement perform three time average three measurement record . Children classify accordingly sex , age height-specific chart . ( iii ) Biochemical analysis perform laboratory clinical pathology HSM . Blood sample collect overnight feasting ( 10-12 hour ) presence one parents/ caregiver , local application topical anesthesia patch ( EMLA ) . Blood glucose level determine use hexokinase method insulin assess use chemiluminescence immunoassay technique . Insulin sensitivity derive homeostasis model assessment ( HOMA ) method . Total cholesterol , triglyceride , high density lipoprotein cholesterol determine use enzymatic , GPO-trinder , direct method , respectively . Plasma liver enzyme ( AST , ALT , GGT ) assess modify IFCC method . C-reactive protein determine use turbidimetric immunoassay ( Siemens , ADVIA 2400 , Newark , DE , USA ) . Energy intake A three-day food record ( 2 weekday 1 weekend day ) use semi-quantitative scaling ( e.g . number spoon scoop ) use order provide comprehensive information meal pattern estimate energy intake . Although know overweight child tend underestimate energy intake , 3-day food diary still consider acceptable often use instrument clinical practice . Moreover , use 3-day food diary instead 7-day , may enhance adherence instrument . Physical activity , sedentary behavior cardiorespiratory fitness Data accelerometer upload Exercise Health Laboratory , Faculty Human Kinetics , University Lisbon , Lisbon , Portugal . Sedentary activity questionnaires CRF assessed institution . ( ) PA assess accelerometer ( ACTIGRAPH GT3X , Pensacola , Florida , USA ) . All subject use one accelerometer right hip , near iliac crest , least one weekend day two week day , except sleep , bath swimming . The accelerometer program use 5-second cycle . Only day 480 min ( 8h ) count , consider analysis . Periods 60 min `` zero activity '' interpret un-using equipment . The data upload perform ActiLife software , version 6.8.0 . Between 0 149 counts/minute consider sedentary activity ; 150 499 , Light Physical Activity ( LPA ) ; 500 3999 , Moderate Physical Activity ( MPA ) ; 4000 7599 , Vigorous Physical Activity ( VPA ) ; 7600 counts/minute Very Vigorous Physical Activity ( VVPA ) ; ( ii ) Sedentary behavior assess questionnaire ( questionnaire ASAQ - adolescent sedentary activity questionnaire ) additionally accelerometry , answer wait assessment CRF . The ASAQ reliable cost-effective instrument may able measure three dimension sedentary behavior ( type , frequency time/duration ) . ( iii ) CRF indirectly determine maximal exercise test use cycle ergometer ( electronically brake cycle ergometer , Monark 839 Ergomedic , Monark , Vansbro , Sweden ) . Initial workload increment 40 50 W girl boy , respectively . Heart rate register continuously ( Polar Vantage NV , Polar Electro Oy , Kempele , Finland ) . Criteria stop test include heart rate superior theoretical maximal heart rate ( 208 - 0.7 ( age ) , failure maintain frequency least 30 revolutions/min , subjective judgement observer adolescent exhaust . The maximal power output ( Wmax ) calculate power last fully complete workload plus power increment last step multiply time proportion complete last step . The maximal power output convert VO2 ( ml/kg/min ) use follow equation : VO2 ( 1∕min ) = 0.465 + ( 0.0112 ×Wmax ) + ( 0.172 × sex ) , sex =0 girl sex=1 boy ( 38 ) . Carotid intima-media thickness pulse wave velocity cIMT pulse wave velocity measure Exercise Health Laboratory , Faculty Human Kinetics , University Lisbon , Lisbon , Portugal . ( ) cIMT measure ultrasound imager use 13 MHz probe ( MyLab One , Esaote , Genoa , Italy ) . cIMT define distance lumen-intima media-adventitia interface . The measurement perform longitudinal plane right carotid artery , accordingly previously validate radiofrequency-based track arterial wall allow real-time determination common carotid far-wall thickness ( QIMT® ) high spatial temporal resolution . cIMT automatically measure , distension curve acquire within CCA 1.59-cm region interest , approximately 1 cm proximal carotid bifurcation . Maximum minimum carotid diameter obtain distension curve . ( ii ) PWV measure applanation tonometry immediately ultrasound imaging . Pressure curve leave carotid , femoral , radial distal posterial tibial artery assess two specific pressure sensitive transducer . The distance carotid femoral , radial distal posterial tibial artery , measure directly enter Complior Analyse software ( ALAM Medical , Paris , France ) . Left brachial blood pressure measure enter software . The value obtain carotid femoral artery ( aortic ) , carotid radial artery ( upper limb ) carotid distal posterior tibial artery ( low limb ) record index central/aortic , upper low limb arterial stiffness , respectively . Statistical method Statistical analysis perform use software IBM SPSS statistic ( IBM SPSS statistic , version 22.0 , IBM , New York , USA ) . We intend use Chi-square one-way analysis variance ( ANOVA ) evaluate baseline difference control intervention group . The effect intervention analyze analysis co-variance ( ANCOVA ) control baseline value continuous variable .</detailed_description>
