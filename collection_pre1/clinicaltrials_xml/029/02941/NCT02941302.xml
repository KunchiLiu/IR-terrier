However , well know problem , conventional magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , often difficult detect area low tumor infiltration , especially gliomas , infiltrative often diffuse nature.The study two purpose : I.To correlate image border zone pathological grade different tumor site follow surgery patient newly diagnose intracranial glioma , work biological border zone , complete resect tumor.II.To determine feasibility define optimal target volume radiation therapy use MR spectroscopy , diffusion , perfusion functional imaging .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Gliomas widely infiltrative tumor . Although oncological resection feasible , compelling evidence patient benefit resection tumor . The surgical target main tumor bulk , define contrast enhance part tumor preoperative MRI . Surgical treatment glioma base maximal safe resection mass . Several new technology devise maximize resection intraoperative MRI one new technology . Intraoperative MRI show many study increase extent resection glioma surgery . Intraoperative determination extent resection , however , require use intravenous contrast administration , technical limitation . Fundamental problem associate use contrast material enhancement resection margin contrast leakage resection cavity . Both problem complicate differential diagnosis residual tumor surgically induced change . Nowadays , basic theory large removal tumor image boundary . Knowledge spatial extent glioma essential prerequisite treatment planning . In particular , localization border zone tumor infiltrate normal brain tissue one major problem solve begin therapy . However , well know problem , conventional magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , often difficult detect area low tumor infiltration , especially gliomas , infiltrative often diffuse nature .</detailed_description>
