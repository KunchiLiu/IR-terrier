	<brief_title>A Trial Looking Treating Dry Mouth After Radiotherapy Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dry mouth common complaint radiotherapy cancer head neck region . It distress often persistent condition lead longlasting oral discomfort , dental infection , diminish quality life , social isolation loneliness . Unfortunately , current therapy dry mouth often unsatisfactory , expensive may result adverse effect . A novel intraoral electronic device recently develop treat dry mouth . The device , act `` salivary pacemaker '' , harmlessly stimulate nerve salivary gland cause adverse side effect . The aim proposal assess longterm effect device population , yet investigate , demonstrate whether daily application effective method lessen dry mouth improve life quality . 84 individual enrol study use device 12 month , receive appropriate instruction . 42 participant ( 84 ) act control receive sham device deliver electric stimulus tactile stimulation ( like use chew gum ) . All participant allow continue use routine local therapy dry mouth ( e.g . artificial saliva ) study . Each participant keep diary relevant frequency use potential change dry mouth sensation . Participants also ask attend hospital appointment measure change saliva production complete questionnaire dry mouth quality life . The device potential radically change current clinical practice . If trial successful , use device provide patient radiation-induced dry mouth safe drug-free therapeutic modality .</detailed_description>
