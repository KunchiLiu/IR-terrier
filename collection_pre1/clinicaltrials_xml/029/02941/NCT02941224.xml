Patients , provide informed consent , agree risk benefit state patient inform consent document . 4 . Patients document diagnosis Peripheral Arterial Disease ( PAD ) classify Rutherford class 234 Superficial Femoral Artery ( SFA ) and/or Popliteal Artery ( PA ) . Patients document diagnosis PAD classify Rutherford class 2 , may include case conservative medicinal treatment prove ineffective patient . 5 . Patients able walk without assistive device walker cane . 6 . Patients eligible peripheral revascularization mean PTA . 7 . The target vessel reference diameter must ≥ 3.0 ≤ 7.0 mm . 8 . The target lesion length must ≤ 15 cm stenosed occlude . 9 . The target lesion must native , nonstented SFA and/or PA target vessel locate ≥ 1 cm Common Femoral Artery ( CFA ) bifurcation terminate distally ≥ 1 cm origin TibialPeroneal ( TP ) trunk . 10 . Treatment multiple target lesion allow , long composite target lesion length ≤ 15 cm target lesion treat maximum 2 overlap Investigational Devices . 11 . The target lesion must either denovo restenotic ( stenosis ≥ 70 % diameter reduction occlusion visual estimate ) . If target lesion restenotic , prior PTA must do &gt; 30 day priorindex procedure . 12 . The target lesion must successfully cross guide wire must successful predilatation target lesion , absence early recoil , significant remain stenosis flowlimiting dissection . 13 . There must patent ( &lt; 50 % stenosis ) inflow artery , confirm angiography . Treatment inflow disease index procedure allow . Patients flowlimiting inflow lesion include , inflow lesion treat ( use DES DCB allow ) successfully ( attainment residual diameter stenosis ≤ 30 % without major vascular complication ) . There must least 1 patent ( &lt; 50 % stenosis ) native outflow artery ankle , confirm angiography . Treatment outflow disease index procedure NOT permit . 1 . Patients know hypersensitivity contraindication aspirin , heparin , anticoagulant/antiplatelet therapy , Sirolimus ( analog ) sensitivity contrast medium adequately premedicated . 2 . Patients obligatory need cumarine anticoagulant ( e.g . Novel Oral Anticoagulant ( NOAC ) drug ) . 3 . Patients contraindication mention Instructions Use ( IFU ) Investigational Device . 4 . Patients life expectancy , Investigator 's opinion , less 3 year . 5 . Patients currently participate clinical investigation involve investigational drug device may potentially confound result Clinical Investigation , would limit patient 's compliance followup requirement Clinical Investigation . 6 . Patients history Myocardial Infarction ( MI ) , thrombolysis angina within 30 day priorindex procedure . 7 . Patients history major disable stroke within 3 month priorindex procedure . 8 .
