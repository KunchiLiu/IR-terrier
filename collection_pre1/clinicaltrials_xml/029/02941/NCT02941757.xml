	<brief_title>Feeding America 's Bravest : Mediterranean Diet-Based Interventions Change Firefighters ' Eating Habits</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aims hypothesis : Recognizing benefit safety Mediterranean diet CVD prevention , investigator seek develop behavioral change strategy fire service modify exist food culture base key principle Mediterranean diet . Using education , participation incentive , investigator propose motivate firefighter family incorporate Mediterranean diet principle work home . The research design allow u measure effectiveness Mediterranean Nutrition Interventions ( MDNIs ) `` field setting '' fire service change eat behavior modify CVD risk . Additionally , cost-effectiveness strategy future wide implementation examine . Specifics aim : 1 . Develop multi-pronged , MDNI behavior change strategy include : diet/lifestyle education ; discount access key Mediterranean diet food ; electronic education platform reminder ; target incentive . MDNI component refine via survey , literature review local/national firefighter input include labor/management fire service focus group . Hypothesis ( 1 ) . Cost-effective , fire-service MDNIs develop career randomize controlled trial ( RCT ) . 2 . Cluster Randomized Diet Intervention-Phase I- Indianapolis Fire Department ( IFD ) 1,000 member . All 45 IFD firehouse cluster randomize two group individual member consent regard study participation . Group 1 receive active 12-month MDNI , Group 2 receive intervention . 3 . Cluster Randomized Diet Intervention -Phase II : Group 1 cross-over `` self-sustained continuation '' 12 month examine persistence behavior change less intense , self-directed maintenance diet intervention . Group 2 cross-over receive MDNI 6 month ( assess short MDNI ) , follow final 6 month self-sustained continuation . Our exist modify Mediterranean diet score ( mMDS ) integrate validated score nutrition questionnaire . Questionnaires , mMDS clinical data collect longitudinally throughout phase RCT . Hypotheses ( 2-3 ) . Both MDNI length improve mMDS , reduce weight , improve Cardiovascular Disease ( CVD ) risk profile career firefighter . The 12 month MDNI produce great persistence adherence 6 month MDNI . Cost-effective method combine message discount improve firefighter ' diet develop validate , low cost method adaptable widespread translation implementation throughout career fire service . Implementation Fire Service : Our national survey career volunteer firefighter demonstrate several common key fact . Firefighters would like nutrition information fire service want learn healthy eating . Moreover , succeed , dietary approach must acceptable firefighter . The Mediterranean diet require completely give food ; therefore , easily adopt long-term adherence . In survey , Mediterranean diet great appeal among five propose diet description . In addition , web-based tool , educational material behavior change strategy propose develop low-cost cost-effective . With support fire service partner , practical widespread implementation local basis individual fire department regionally/nationally fire service organization . Project/Statistical analysis : Data recording , storage , management , clean basic analysis perform use SPSS . The data import Stata SAS advance statistical analysis multivariable regression longitudinal data analysis , need . Differences mean value quantitative variable two group assess use independent t-test whereas difference mean value among three group examine use analysis variance ( ANOVA ) technique ( non-parametric Wilcoxon Kruskal-Wallis test , respectively , appropriate ) . Differences qualitative characteristic compare use chi-square test , Fisher 's exact test , McNemar 's test ( paired comparison ) , appropriate . Statistical significance analysis p &lt; 0.05 , test two-tailed . RCT : During first 12 month RCT , group 1 2 compare directly intention treat basis accord randomization subject 's fire house . This type analysis- disregard personal level compliance engagement particular participant- rigorous appropriate primary interest test effect behavior change strategy . As several outcome assess participant throughout study ( 3 annual medical exam 5 semi-annual assessment ( weight , mMDS , etc . evaluate ) ) , repeat measure technique , mixed model generalized estimate equation model , utilized estimate change time key outcome . The investigator take consideration specific variance-covariance structure correlate measurement . After adjust baseline time-dependent covariates , change outcomes interest assess compare among group . The investigator expect great power within-group change ( paired comparison ) . For RCT , sensitivity analysis perform demonstrate even bad case scenario 500 firefighter would enrol , study well-powered intention treat comparison MDNI vs usual care . Several conservative example give small change . However , consistent previous study , investigator expect MDNI actually produce large change would easily measure . The first example assume MDNI achieve small increase mMDS 6 point ( 1.0 time population 's baseline SD base cross-sectional study mMDS ) . Barriers : Several potential barrier successful completion MDNIs identify take specific step prevent surmount barrier . Some question whether firefighter follow diet home well work . First , preliminary work demonstrate firefighter eat good home work . Second , proposal recognize family 's importance incorporate measure educate involve family member share meal may much shop cook . Another challenge MDNI cost sustainability wide implementation . Therefore , economist add team expertise food nutrition ensure intervention develop low cost , cost-effective sustainable . MDNIs cost-effective measure societal perspective . An additional challenge identify career randomize trial potential movement firefighter one station another study period . This one reason investigator choose Indianapolis fire department : 90 % member permanently assign fire house . Thus , minimal loss/change firefighter ' intervention assignment course project . Finally , current proposal facilitate challenge national implementation directly address career volunteer fire service . Human Subjects : Recruitment- Previously , investigator successful participant recruitment FEMA-sponsored study . For example , 90 % IFD member approach consented current FEMA cardiac imaging study . Additionally , research proposal endorse significant fire service partner , increase trust willingness participate . The extent consent participant personally engage MDNIs voluntary , additional time commitment require study nominal- RCT : weigh-in , blood pressure check , waist circumference measure questionnaire completion every six month ; demonstration project web-based survey every six month . Moreover , study design firefighter consent receive MDNI point opportunity health benefit . Therefore , problem identify recruit necessary participant RCT demonstration project expect . Confidentiality IRB : Any RCT data proposal transfer Harvard extract de-identified form without personal identifier maintain confidential manner . PHI linkages de-identified data maintain lock , safe location PSM 's clinical facility . Harvard researcher access de-identified data ensure research low risk breach confidentiality . For demonstration project , consent form name link study code use electronic data collection . The linkage volunteer name maintain lock , safe location Harvard . All electronic data restrict authorized personnel password protect . All protocol , questionnaire procedure approve Harvard 's IRB DHS participant contacted/recruited .</detailed_description>
