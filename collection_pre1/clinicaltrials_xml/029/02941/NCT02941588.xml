	<detailed_description>Recent guideline ACC/AHA suggest elective non-cardiac surgery ( NCS ) optimally delay one year percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) drug-eluting stent ( DES ) . Regarding antiplatelet agent , dual antiplatelet therapy , least aspirin recommend continued consider relative risk bleed stent thrombosis especially first 4 6 week DES implantation . However , recommendation base upon insufficient conflicting evidence . The aim study ( 1 ) determine independent risk factor postoperative adverse event strength association , ( 2 ) ass incidence postoperative morbidity include major adverse cardiovascular cerebral event function time PCI surgery ( 3 ) compare bleed amount transfusion requirement different interval PCI surgery duration antiplatelet agent administration prior surgery . To achieve aim , undertook retrospective cohort study patient underwent noncardiac surgery PCI DES .</detailed_description>
