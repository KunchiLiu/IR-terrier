	<brief_title>Correlation Between Circulating Tumor Cells Brain Disease Control After Focal Radiotherapy Metastases Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Brain metastasis ( BM ) prevalent tumor central nervous system ( CNS ) , ratio 10 : 1 relative primary tumor . In breast cancer , BM become frequent due long life expectancy . Patients HER2-positive metastatic disease prone develop BM often occur 20 - 40 % case . Circulating tumor cell ( CTC ) originate primary tumor migrate distant organ . The possible correlation CTC incidence brain metastasis could help define radiotherapy patient oligometastatic widespread disease brain . However , study evaluate scenario . Purpose : To assess number CTC 4-5 week focal stereotactic radiotherapy single ( SRS ) fractionate ( SFRT ) dose correlate local distant brain progression free survival patient metastatic breast cancer . Potential invasion marker cell evaluate correlated clinical outcome . Patients Methods : Prospective , single-center research develop Radiation Oncology Department AC Camargo Cancer Center . Patients diagnosis metastatic breast cancer brain indication focal radiotherapy , SRS SFRT , recruit . The blood collect processed analysis CTC ISET method ( Rarecells , France ) . The invasion marker ( HER-2 , COX-2 , EGFR , Notch 1 ST6GALNAC5 ) analyze CTC immunocytochemistry . Expected Results : If hypothesis proven , may include analysis quantification CTC clinical practice early indicator local distant recurrence brain .</detailed_description>
