	<brief_title>Get Fruved : Obesity Prevention Older Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal research develop novel strategy promote healthy behavior associate obesity prevention older adolescent population . A community base participatory research ( CBPR ) approach use partnership among old adolescent , university researcher faculty , Extension partner . The objective test effectiveness peer-led , train-the-trainer intervention . The intervention interactive , non-traditional social marketing , online medium , environmental change approach seek promote healthy behavior community college high school student . Specific health behavior target include increase intake fruit vegetable , decrease food high saturate fat add sugar , manage stress , increase physical activity . This project uniquely 1 ) increase participant engagement creative interaction , participant-created content , incorporation age-appropriate technology ; 2 ) incorporate social environment peer-led strategy ; 3 ) simultaneously address change environment support participant-driven behavior change effort . This project Pretest-Posttest , Control Group Trial use nested cohort design three condition ( intense intervention , diffuse intervention , control ) , four control universities four intervention university year 01- 03 , one high school control one intervention four intervention university town year 03-04 , disseminate four additional university high school pair year 04-05 . A CBPR , peer-led approach use upper level college student mentor freshmen 4-H college student development intervention . The CBPR , peer-led approach continue sophomore 4-H college student implement intervention incoming college freshman follow year . The train-the-trainer approach utilized junior level 4-H college student mentor 4-H high school student modification intervention high school . The approach continue 4-H high school student implement intervention incoming freshman high school . In fall year 01 , 283 freshman student recruit general/survey nutrition course four intervention university participate special undergraduate spring course ( intense intervention group ) . 94 freshman student also recruit general/survey nutrition course four control university . During fall , researcher intervention school work nutrition ( graduate undergraduate ) student identify develop partnership student organization development social marketing health promotion campaign . Researchers student partner also work local high school ( include student organization , school food service , Parent Teacher Associations , school wellness committee , administration ) school board formalize research agreement relationship . In spring year 01 , part newly develop undergraduate course , freshman student ( intense intervention group ) intervention university join collegiate 4-H program . The course offer independent study newly develop course respective University 's PI . The course cover principal social marketing health behavior change . University researcher Extension faculty collaborate taught in-person class respective collegiate 4-H student . Collegiate 4-H student co-taught ( four University 's research Extension faculty ) opportunity interact collegiate 4-H student four intervention university web-based technology . Throughout course , collegiate 4-H student develop plan social marketing campaign .

Throughout campaign , collegiate 4-H student work researcher assess healthiness campus environment use previously develop Healthy Campus Audit advocate change physical food environment . In year 02 , random sample 1,153 freshman ( diffuse intervention group ) , determine screen increase health risk recruit eight university ( four intervention four control ) . The collegiate 4-H student ( intense intervention group ) student control school recruit year 01 reassess . In year 03 , collegiate 4-H team ( intense intervention group ) use refine toolkit test implement intervention college campus . The sustainability observe change individual environmental college level assess conduct follow-up assessment student intervention ( diffuse intervention group ) control sit college year 03 . The collegiate 4-H student ( intensive intervention group ) lead project high school level student control school recruit year 01 reassess begin fall year 03 , end spring year 03 . Also year 03 , assessment process high school 4-H student ( intense intervention group ) pilot test college student work high school student adapt toolkit use implementation social marketing campaign high school setting ( diffuse intervention ) . In year 04 , two high school four intervention University state recruit participate research process randomize control intervention . High school state match size community composition geographically separate prevent potential exposure campaign . Following train-the-trainer model , team junior collegiate 4-H student ( intense intervention group ) mentor team high school 4-H student ( intense intervention group ) intervention sit development implementation Fruved campaign high school environment . In fall , collegiate student work high school student ( intense intervention group ) modify campaign meet age cultural need high school audience plan specific campaign component . The high school 4-H team partner school 's food service , Parent Teacher Association ( PTA ) , school Wellness committee , school administration throughout campaign development , implementation , evaluation . The campaign conduct intervention high school remain nine-month school year . In year 04 , random sample 331 freshman high school student ( diffuse intervention group ) recruit intervention high school random sample 331 freshman high school student ( control group ) control high school four intervention University town area . Assessments take place early fall late spring . The 4-H high school student ( intensive intervention group ) recruit participate design implementation phase project also assess early fall/late spring year 04 . Also year 04 , continue assess sustainability observe change individual environmental high school level , participant assess conduct follow-up assessment student intensive intervention group control sit high school . The collegiate 4-H student ( intensive intervention group ) lead project high school level student control school recruit year 01 reassess begin fall year 04 end spring year 04 . In year 04-05 , material develop allow project disseminate college high school environment . Four additional college high school pair recruit participate dissemination phase .

The nine month interactive , social marketing environmental intervention aid old adolescent effectively prevent obesity increase healthfulness diet , increase physical activity , improve stress management behavior compare control group . On measure anticipate participant intensive intervention group great improvement diffuse intervention group intensive diffuse intervention group improvement control group . Students participate intervention effectively manage weight non-intervention control condition ; participate intervention improve intermediary outcome related diet , physical activity , improve stress management great extent control condition ; environment intervention sit show health behavior-supportive change compare control sit . Since two time interval design , General Linear Modeling use analyze change physical assessment , specifically mixed-model Analysis variance covariance ( ANCOVA ) group-specific slope homogeneous . A wide range analysis employ analyze influence intervention secondary outcome , include multivariate analysis variance ( MANOVA ) , ANOVAs , logistic regression . Significant ANOVAs follow test simple main effect appropriate . The intervention group-by-occasions interaction test ass impact intervention treatment group relative control group across time secondary outcome measure .</detailed_description>
