	<brief_summary>Aim : To investigate impact antioxidant ( acetyl-L-carnitine , N-acetyl-L-cysteine a-lipoic acid ) embryo development subsequently clinical outcome . Including clinic use low oxygen ambient air embryo culture . Analysed time-lapse system . Study medium : G-TL antioxidant . Control medium : Same medium without antioxidant . Type study : Study compare blastocyst development cohort oocyte use two different medium , G-TL versus G-TL supplement antioxidant . Statistics base absolute increase Good Quality Blastocysts day 5 7 % . Design : Multicentre prospective randomize sibling trial . Single blastocyst transfer . Superiority study Primary Endpoint : Good Quality Blastocysts day 5 per allocate normally fertilize oocyte . Patients : Comparative embryo sibling study 128 patient include .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study objective : Study compare blastocyst development cohort oocyte use two different medium , G-TL versus G-TL supplement antioxidant . Primary endpoint : Percentage good quality blastocyst ( GQB ) per fertilize oocyte day 5 . Secondary endpoint - Embryo development day 3 , 5 6 - Embryo quality day 3 , 5 6 - Total blastocyst formation ( day 5 day 6 ) - Utilization rate ( embryo available transfer cryopreservation ) - Implantation rate - Clinical pregnancy rate Setup : Prospective embryo sibling , superiority study MATERIALS AND METHODS Intervention New type embryo culture medium use vitro culture human IVF embryo . Power analysis The plan power analysis make together statistician , Nils-Gunnar Pehrsson . From retrospective data use simulation , intra individual SD difference % GQB two medium strategy estimate 32 % . In order find difference 8 % GQB two medium power 80 % pair T-test 128 couple need . Randomization Couples enrol study fertilization check ( day 1 ) . A minimum 6 zygote require participation . Stratified randomization zygotes couple performed . For couple zygote number . These zygote couple block ( two ) randomize two medium type ; A ( Traditional culture medium = Control ) B ( Antioxidant medium = intervention ) . In group traditional culture perform . Allocation perform 1:1 ratio accord unique randomization list couple . Blinding To minimize possible bias primary outcome ( GQE D5 ) embryologist perform morphological evaluation day 5/6 know group embryos belong . Both physician couple blind group allocate . IVF treatment procedure A traditional IVF treatment perform include ovarian stimulation oocyte pick-up use standard method clinic . Embryo assessment timing assessment accord Alpha/ESHRE consensus criterion . Morphological score Blastocyst morphology score accord Consensus Scoring system blastocyst ( Istanbul Consensus workshop embryo assessment ) morphology document individual photo blastocyst . Blastocyst score perform inverted microscope day 5 day 6 . A good quality blastocyst define least Grade 2:2:2 accord Istanbul Consensus grade system . ( Balaban et al. , 2011 ) . DOCUMENTATION All patient participate study document computerized CRF . This document related patient ' record relevant clinical laboratory data specific IVF cycle . Through journal system ( WinIVF ) use Fertilitetscentrum , possible generate complete list variable include study . Patients ask participate study fulfill criterion randomization also register . STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Both Intention-to-Treat ( ITT ) population Per Protocol ( PP ) population define . Primary efficacy variable superiority study difference % GQB two medium type couple . Primary statistical analysis two-sided paired T-test regard mean difference % GQB Standard culture medium Antioxidant medium ITT population . A two side 95 % confidence interval mean difference % GOB two medium calculate . All significance test two-sided conducted 5 % significance level .</detailed_description>
