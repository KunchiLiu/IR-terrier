	<detailed_description>Background : New design 6-year undergraduate medical education ( UME ) mainly include ( 1 ) integral curriculum body organ system , ( 2 ) multiple method clinical teach assessment , ( 3 ) generalism UME . UME mean enable graduate become undifferentiated general physician . Accompany decrease educational hour classroom hospital , essential minor component primary healthcare ophthalmology otolaryngology-head neck surgery ( ORL-HNS ) disproportionately under-represented UME . In Canada , substantial downstream effect manage ORL-HNS problem note family medicine resident . In order improve learning insufficiency enhance clinical competency without increase extra-hours classroom hospital , novel medical education stress enable self-directory learn increase learning hour outside classroom . Accordingly , hypothesize innovation educational technology enhance learn outcome ORL-HNS . Purposes : This study aim determine whether mobile technology e-learning ( M-TEL ) effective tool instruction ORL-HNS compare effect different cognitive style learn outcomes M-TEL various module medical education . Material Methods : This randomize controlled trial . Firstly , setup e-learning platform Top 10 emergent ORL-HNS disorder translate application ( APP ) function execute mobile device . Secondly , recruit 60 UME student without previous train ORL-HNS undergo Group Embedded Figures Test determine cognitive style field dependence field-independence . After blinded randomization , student instruct two module emergent ORL-HNS disorder , use either standard e-learning text-figure Power Point show interactive multimedia module . Subjects evaluate emergent ORL-HNS disorder use text-based assessment multimedia assessment take place prior follow instruction . Anticipating Outcome : This study ( 1 ) establish M-TEL ORL-HNS deliver innovatively mobile e-learning supplement deficiency classroom hour , ( 2 ) confirm M-TEL enhance efficiency instruction ORL-HNS , ( 3 ) understand difference learn outcomes M-TEL various module medical education field dependence file independence use platform .</detailed_description>
