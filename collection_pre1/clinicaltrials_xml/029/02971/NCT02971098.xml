	<brief_summary>The over-65 population increase alarm rate , six 10 manage one chronic condition 2030 , make much great proportion hospitalization ever . Hospitalizations disease , injury , and/or surgery group likely impair physical mobility , therefore , old adult capacity physically active hospitalization beyond . The result sedentary lifestyle likely accept `` new normal '' , ultimately increase risk skeletal muscle metabolic dysfunction ( e.g . impaired glucose disposal , insulin resistance ) . These devastate outcome neither inevitable necessary prevent appropriate mechanism-based intervention . A novel mechanism may contribute physical inactivity-induced insulin resistance accumulation inflammation ceramide within skeletal muscle . Of interest , increase skeletal muscle inflammation ceramide tie various metabolic disturbance diabetes insulin resistance . However , currently unknown skeletal muscle inflammation ceramide key mechanism associate insulin resistance due physical inactivity old adult .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator team recruit young old ( N=30 ; 18-35y 60-85 yr ) male female adult recruit Salt Lake City area . The investigator team schedule separate visit Strength , Power Physical Function separate visit Lean Mass OGTT measurement ( see description ) . 1 . Lean Mass , oral glucose tolerance test , Strength , Power , Exercise Testing Physical Function Measurements . Lean mass assessment via dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) , ultra sound peripheral quantitative compute tomography ( pQCT ) assess center clinical translational science ( CCTS ) knee extensor isometric strength , power physical function test conduct Skeletal muscle exercise research facility ( SMERF ) laboratory ( 520 Wakara Way ) . These endpoint consider secondary objective determine relationship insulin sensitivity muscle cell signal event . These test occur within one week reduce activity experiment repeat complete reduced activity period exercise training . For lean mass assessment , subject test morning overnight fast prior DXA scan . Isometric strength assess leg maximal voluntary isometric contraction effort ( 600 knee angle ) develop knee extensor ( quadriceps ) plantar/dorsi flexor muscle dynamometer . For low extremity extension power test Nottingham power rig use . The following battery functional performance test use : Stair ascent/descent time , six-minute walk distance , 50 foot walk time , time go test . All test test frequently safely perform old individual . Maximal oxygen consumption ( exercise test ) measure metabolic cart grade maximal exercise test stationary cycle ergometer . This test perform CCTS direct supervision exercise physiologist . 2 . Physical Activity Monitoring , Dietary Record . Subjects fit ankle Step Activity Monitor order determine daily level physical activity 7 day period precede reduced physical activity study . Additionally , 3-day daily dietary record self-reported period . The participant properly instruct research team member conduct reporting wear ankle activity monitor . 3 . Insulin Clamp Study , Metabolic Rate Muscle Biopsies . On separate day , participant arrive CCTS fast morning Day 1 euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp study perform do previously . The research team physician oversee clamp procedure experience use method . Metabolic rate determine 30 minute initiation insulin infusion 30 minute end insulin infusion period . Metabolic rate determine use indirect calorimeter house CCTS . To , participant fit canopy hood . The participant breathe normally 30 minute procedure . The canopy remove first muscle biopsy occur . A vastus lateralis muscle biopsy sample 3h clamp combine periodic blood sample measure fast insulin-stimulated insulin , glucose , muscle cell signal endpoint , specific ceramide specie . Biopsies occur opposite leg . Muscle biopsy perform trained CCTS nurse do routinely bed rest study older adult . Muscle sample flash-frozen liquid nitrogen store later analysis . After clamp experiment , subject begin reduce physical inactivity study take place participant home . On Day 14 , participant return CCTS follow overnight fast insulin clamp study repeat order make comparison pre insulin clamp study ( Day 1 ) . 4 . Reduced Physical inactivity experiment . After completion first insulin clamp experiment ( Day 1 ) , subject adhere 14-days reduce physical activity home conduce . The goal participant maintain ~2000 steps/day determine monitor subject able see record . The investigator inform participant normal diet remain . As mentioned , day 7 , participant return DXA scan , OGTT 's thigh muscle biopsy . Also mention , Day 14 , overnight fast , second insulin clamp study couple muscle biopsy conduct detailed CCTS . Lean mass , strength , power , physical function measurement re-assessed later day follow reduce activity study .</detailed_description>
