	<brief_summary>Each year , almost 3 million newborn baby die within first month life , often consequence labour complication . Approximately 5 % newborns start breathe birth need immediate help . The optimal ventilation strategy liquid-filled lung determine . Animal study suggest assist ventilation positive end expiratory pressure ( PEEP ) improve aeration liquid-filled lung lead rapid recovery . However , large human clinical study investigate clinical response assist ventilation PEEP asphyxiate newborn .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Laerdal Global Health develop PEEP valve test show provide reliable end-expiratory pressure manikin model , even high mask leak . Whether PEEP valve provide reliable PEEP vivo whether translates clinical beneficial outcome remain proven . The aim study whether lung aeration improve add device positive end expiratory pressure ( PEEP ) good distend airways neonates 28 week gestation .</detailed_description>
