	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well osimertinib without bevacizumab work treat patient EGFR positive non-small cell lung cancer spread brain . Osimertinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , may interfere ability tumor cell grow spread . Giving osimertinib without bevacizumab may work well treat patient non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Osimertinib With Without Bevacizumab Treating Patients With EGFR Positive Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Brain Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine progression-free survival osimertinib plus bevacizumab compare osimertinib alone . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety tolerability combination osimertinib bevacizumab . II . To evaluate time progression central nervous system ( CNS ) osimertinib plus bevacizumab versus single-agent osimertinib . III . To determine overall response rate intracranial response rate combination versus single agent . IV . To assess overall survival patient receive osimertinib plus bevacizumab compare osimertinib alone . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To investigate mechanism sensitivity resistance combination osimertinib plus bevacizumab versus osimertinib molecularly characterize tumor sample include T790M status . II . To assess whether circulate tumor deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) plasma use indicator sensitivity resistance treatment . III . To determine whether angiogenic signature use multiplex panel array associate benefit combination osimertinib plus bevacizumab . IV . To investigate angiogenesis , immune signal pathway marker tumor sample determine biomarkers predictive benefit combination therapy . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 arm . ARM I : Patients receive osimertinib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-12 bevacizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30-90 minute day 1 . ARM II : Patients receive osimertinib PO QD day 1-12 . In arm , course repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow minimum 4 week .</detailed_description>
