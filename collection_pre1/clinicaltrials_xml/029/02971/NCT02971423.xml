	<brief_summary>This research project conduct look safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics ( PK ; human body process substance ) ETX2514 give healthy volunteer intravenously single dose , give multiple intravenous dos 8 consecutive day . As anticipated ETX2514 could use treatment Acinetobacter baumannii ( type bacteria ) infection , project also look whether ETX2514 interact current treatment infection administer time .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Safety , Tolerability Pharmacokinetics Intravenous ETX2514 Administered Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 1 , single-center , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled study investigates safety , tolerability , PK profile single multiple ascend dos intravenous ( IV ) ETX2514 administer intravenously alone combination sulbactam and/or imipenem/cilastatin healthy adult participant . The study conduct four Parts : A , B , C , D. Part A explore safety tolerability single ascend dose ( SAD ) IV ETX2514 8 cohort . Part B explore safety tolerability multiple ascending dos ( MAD ) IV ETX2514 4 cohort . Part C explore safety tolerability IV ETX2514 administer single dose combination sulbactam ( 1.0 gram [ g ] ) and/or imipenem/cilastatin ( 0.5 g ) healthy participant 2 cohort . Part D explore safety tolerability multiple dos combine IV ETX2514/sulbactam ( 1.0 g ) /imipenem/cilastatin ( 0.5 g ) healthy participant .</detailed_description>
