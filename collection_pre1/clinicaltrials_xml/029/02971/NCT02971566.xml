	<brief_title>Splanchnic Oxygenation Response Enteral Feeds Preterm Infants With Abnormal Antenatal Doppler .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intrauterine growth restriction ( IUGR ) major cause perinatal morbidity mortality . Severe IUGR often due impaired placental circulation , absent reverse end-diastolic flow ( AREDF ) velocity umbilical artery . Fetuses AREDF adapt chronic hypoxia undergo blood flow redistribution , favor cerebral perfusion expense mesenteric district . The result hypoxic-ischemic injury intestinal mucosa represent major risk factor post-natal development gastrointestinal complication , necrotizing enterocolitis ( NEC ) , spontaneous intestinal perforation ( SIP ) feed intolerance ( FI ) . Due fear aforementioned condition , establishment adequate enteral feeding AREDF preterm infant often difficult ; hence , identification infant high risk GI complication could aid delicate nutritional management . Postnatal Doppler study show decreased blood flow velocity superior mesenteric artery response first enteral feed AREDF preterm infant later develop feed intolerance . A similar Doppler impairment low value splanchnic oxygenation feed introduction describe non-IUGR preterm infant later GI complication . To date , however , know whether impaired mesenteric blood flow observe first feed high-risk AREDF infant persist time , correlate reduce splanchnic oxygenation perfusion . This observational prospective study aim : - ass pattern abdominal oxygenation perfusion response enteral feed AREDF preterm infant different phase enteral feeding establishment ; - evaluate possible correlation development gastrointestinal complication . Infants admit Neonatal Intensive Care Unit ( NICU ) consecutively enrol study fulfil follow criterion : gestational age ≤34 week , stable clinical condition , document evidence antenatal umbilical Doppler impairment . Exclusion criterion : - Enteral feeding prior enrollment - Major congenital abnormality ( include congenital heart disease , gastroschisis , exomphalos ) - Hemodynamic instability , hypotension , patent ductus arteriosus , anemia , sepsis infection time NIRS monitoring Written , inform consent participate study obtain parents/legal guardian infant enrollment . Enrolled infant undergo continuous monitoring splanchnic oxygenation ( SrSO2 ) enteral feed introduction ( 15 ml/kg/die volume administer within first 48 hour life ) full enteral feeding ( FEF ) achievement ( enteral intake ≥150 ml/kg/die ) 30 ' 3 h feed administration mean INVOS 5100 oximeter ( Somanetics Corporation , Troy , MI , USA ) . A simultaneous monitoring peripheral oxygen saturation ( SpO2 ) perform order calculate splanchnic fractional oxygen extraction ( SFOE ) ratio ( [ SpO2-SrSO2 ] /SpO2 ) . SrSO2 value record hypoxic episode ( SpO2 &lt; 85 % ) exclude statistical analysis . GI complication define NEC stage ≥2 , SIP and/or FI ( enteral feeding withhold ≥1 day suggestive clinical sign ) . Enrolled infant retrospectively divide two group : lack ( group 1 ) vs. development ( group 2 ) GI complication . Data analyze use IBM SPSS Statistic version 20.0.0 ( IBM Corporation , IBM Corporation Armonk , New York , United States ) . Clinical characteristic study group compare Mann-Whitney U test continuous variable chi-square test categorical variable . Mann-Whitney U test use compare abdominal SrSO2 FSOE pattern response feed group 1 2 .</detailed_description>
