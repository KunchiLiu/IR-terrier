	<brief_title>Simvastatin Overcoming Chemotherapy Resistance Patients With Relapsed Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To examine effect simvastatin myeloma ( M ) -protein and/or free light chain ratio added conventional chemotherapy treatment multiple myeloma patient receive 3 ( = &lt; 3 ) &gt; 3 different chemotherapy regimen . ( group A group B ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate progression-free survival ( PFS ) , time progression ( TTP ) , duration response ( DOR ) group A , group B , group combine . II . To describe toxicity ( frequency severity treatment ) group A , group B , group combine . III . To estimate overall response ( OR ) group A , group B , group combine . IV . To evaluate quality life ( QoL ) patient combine treatment group A , group B , group combine . OUTLINE : Patients receive standard care chemotherapy 3 course simvastatin orally ( PO ) daily 2 day first dose chemotherapy 2 day last dose chemotherapy . Treatment simvastatin continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day , every 3-5 week first 6 month , every 1-3 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
