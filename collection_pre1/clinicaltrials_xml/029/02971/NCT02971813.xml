	<brief_summary>While cardiac rehabilitation ( CR ) show effective improve cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , participation generally poor . For reason , current research , prospective , randomize control pilot study , evaluate impact social medium intervention motivation exercise adherence CR session . Participants randomly assign Facebook™ group enhance education comparison group . The intervention include access private Facebook™ group participant receive weekly educational post , weekly provider support opportunity communicate cardiac rehabilitation patient . Patients comparison group give educational material , supply handout form , email patient absent cardiac rehabilitation . Participants ask fill pre-post motivational questionnaire total number session attend end 3 month tally . This study ground Self-Determination Theory ( SDT ) utilize Behavioral Regulation Exercise Questionnaire ( BREQ-2 ) , base SDT .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Social Media Intervention Exercise Motivation Cardiac Rehabilitation Adherence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research still need determine effectiveness social networking intervention use promote health . Few randomize controlled trial examine use social networking tool exercise adherence health promotion . Further , research address use social medium particularly Facebook , tool affect autonomous motivation cardiac rehabilitation . 1 . The purpose current randomize pilot trial determine effect social medium intervention , provide education , peer support provider support , autonomous motivation self-determination exercise , adherence CR patient CVD 12-week CR program . 2 . A secondary aim pilot test feasibility large , long-term trial . The feasibility large trial base participant use Facebook group ( number `` hit '' ) sample size . 3 . It hypothesize patient expose social medium intervention show increase autonomous motivation exercise attend high percentage CR session compare comparison group receive educational handout email . It also hypothesize great number time participant us private Facebook group ( number `` hit '' ) , great number CR session attend great change autonomous motivation . Theoretical Framework This study ground Self-Determination Theory define motivation term intrinsic extrinsic source . Self-determination theory focus social cognitive factor factor influence individual 's motivation . Self-Determination Theory specifically examine condition lead self-motivation ( autonomous intrinsic nature ) state 3 process necessary exist : competence , autonomy relatedness . There 3 aspect set support process motivationally supportive : Autonomy support , structure involvement . 1 . Autonomy support minimize pressure participant offer choice help individual engage activity personal reason . 2 . Structure help individual set realistic goal offer positive informative feedback . 3 . Involvement describe interaction support significant others . The SDT appropriate framework examination exercise motivation . When examine CR adherence , motivation exercise important concept . It possible intrinsic motivation , present , may enough help patient overcome many obstacle associate non-adherence exercise CR . The Behavioral Regulation Exercise Questionnaire-2 ( BREQ-2 ) instrument employ SDT order measure quality motivation exercise , especially autonomous motivation use Relative Autonomy Index ( RAI ) . Methods Research Design This prospective , randomize control pilot trial evaluate impact social medium intervention motivation exercise adherence cardiac rehabilitation session . Setting The setting study outpatient CR Main Campus Cleveland Clinic Health System Northeast Ohio patient ' home location home computer might access . Sample All patient current regular Facebook user , qualify cardiac rehabilitation ( diagnosed CVD ) , enter cardiac rehabilitation Main Campus Cleveland Clinic , ask participate study time cardiac rehabilitation entrance visit . Current Facebook user choose important participant skilled use internet familiar social medium . Regular use define log onto Facebook least 2 time last month . Inclusion criterion include men woman 18 year age old speak English live within 100 mile Main Campus Cleveland Clinic . Participants must able read English state understanding consent Behavioral Regulation Exercise Questionnaire-2 ( BREQ-2 ) . There exclusion base diagnosis , however , participant must able exercise well enough qualify take part CR . Intervention Motivation exercise measure baseline post-intervention use BREQ-2 . The BREQ-2 validate instrument measure form intrinsic extrinsic regulation exercise behavior base Self-Determination Theory . A relative autonomy index ( RAI ) calculate BREQ-2 , give score relative autonomy , place individual 's motivation type self-determination continuum motivate ( lack intention exercise ) intrinsically motivate ( self-determined autonomously motivate ) . Cardiac rehabilitation adherence determine number CR session attend 3 month period time . To examine association social medium support ( Facebook ) outcome variable CR adherence motivation , number `` hit '' private Facebook site count participant . Educational supportive post `` like '' participant also count . Data Collection Procedures : 1 . After IRB approval , volunteer recruit Cleveland Clinic Main Campus intake visit CR . Volunteers screen Facebook use interest study , protocol explain participant ask sign consent . The consent address fact Facebook public forum name comment see participant research team . The Facebook group private sense group able see content . 2 . Participants give baseline BREQ-2 survey , give time CR intake . 3 . Participants randomize Facebook versus enhance education group use stratify , block randomization . 4 . The Facebook intervention include peer support , education , provider support text message prompt new post add . These intervention design minimize pressure , offer choice , allow peer interaction , positive feedback , guidance direction , order collectively provide autonomy support , structure involvement . 1 . Peer interaction Facebook frequently participant freely chooses monitor research team appropriateness content . 2 . Educational post cover 12 topic encourage participant heart-care offering variety suggestion encourage autonomous healthcare choice . These 12 educational topic standardized posting occur Facebook group , one week one re-posted every 12 week . The post may form text , video and/or picture . 3 . Provider support compose post standardized fashion , much like educational post . Topics include motivational quote , encouragement , reminder exercise independently , reminder contact provider question ( attached document ) . Providers nurse research team , exercise physiologist nurse practitioner physician may may choose reveal personal identity . Input provider use compose message prior implementation study . All Facebook participant see content . Provider support also include link Cleveland Clinic Health Chats , patient chat online provider set date time . 5 . The comparison group receive educational material Facebook group receive handout form , via email patient miss cardiac rehabilitation particular week . The comparison group typical peer interaction CR provider support `` usual care '' . 6 . The data collection study take place entrance visit CR time participant receive BREQ-2 survey . Data Facebook `` hit '' obtain Health Vascular Institute Resource Center The Cleveland Clinic . Data also collect number time educational supportive post `` like '' participant . 7 . Post-testing take place completion CR program , define complete full number session allot insurance , Medicaid Medicare . If participant drop CR prior completion , post-testing do soon participant return testing , willing . Post-testing include BREQ-2 survey well count number session complete 3 month period time . It anticipate pilot take 1 year complete . Data Analysis : Statistical Methods This feasibility study sample size obtain determine study appropriately power detect desired effect size . Patient characteristic summarize group use frequency percentages categorical factor , mean standard deviation continuous measure . In order generate best possible estimate impact primary predictor , model adjust key demographic variable ( age , gender , race , employment , distance cardiac rehabilitation socioeconomic status ) , key clinical variable ( cardiac rehabilitation indication , hypertension , diabetes , hyperlipidemia waist circumference ) . Pearson correlation coefficient calculate ≥ 0.3 included covariate final multivariate analysis . Groups compare overall motivation analysis covariance model , use RAI BREQ-2 . Two-sample t-tests use compare number session complete . Multivariate analysis variance model use evaluate difference change individual motivation subtypes group . Analyses perform use SAS software ( version 9.4 ; Cary , NC ) . An overall significance level 0.05 assumed test . Sample Size Planned enrollment 30 patient group . In first 9 month 2016 , cardiac rehabilitation main campus Cleveland Clinic approximately 170 patient intake . It assume similar number patient intake 9 month period 2017 . It estimate 40 % may meet eligibility requirement agree participate . Allowing use first 8 participant establish Facebook group , estimate sample size would 60 total participant randomization study group include analysis . With sample size , 86 % power detect large effect size ( d=0.8 ) study outcome .</detailed_description>
