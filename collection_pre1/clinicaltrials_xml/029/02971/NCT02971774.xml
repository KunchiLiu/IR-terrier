	<detailed_description>1 . To conduct research , sociologist collaborate Doctor Nicolas Roche , study director . The contribution sociologist offer viewpoint outside medical aspect , allow global identification area live patient affected hemiparesis . Furthermore , sociological perspective seek demonstrate social aspect , heretofore explore little medical public health study , , example , term intimacy self-image . It must delicately capture practice , logic action though patient , place social context evolve develop . Therefore , attention pay certain `` social determinant '' ( sociocultural setting , age gender ) certain resource ( particularly economic , relational material ) , effect way patient perceive cope consequence hemiparesis .

These individual must present hemiparesis secondary single , hemispheric cerebrovascular accident , live home able move inside outside home . Patients several severe cognitive disorder aphasia interview . The study include qualitative component ( corpus approximately 40 interview ) quantitative component ( 100 150 questionnaire ) . 2.1 - Qualitative component The use qualitative component appear necessary order construct quantitative component rigorous manner . Indeed , objective latter component completion target patient questionnaire ( quality life evaluation scale ) intend explore various domain existence , series approximately 20 item include multiple question , prewritten response option . In order produce questionnaire , prior knowledge aspect life affect hemiparesis ( management ) particularly useful , since knowledge still remain yet document . The interest qualitative study therefore promote creation appropriate tool health professional , order conduct evaluation disturbance cause hemiparesis life patient , well evaluation influence therapeutic treatment patient cope hemiparesis . Conduct interview The qualitative study base sociological approach , conduct semi-directive interview , obtain desired item understand . This data collection tool relevant one wish capture mean people give practice , well contexts situation influence . In sociology , interview advantage produce detailed `` story '' , provide description practice , judgement , emotional moment emotional state , explore reason norm push people act think certain manner . It aim reflect individual point view , contradiction , also highlight person ' reflection various experience . In context sociological work , interview associate neutrality researcher , whether manner ask question ( example , regard term use , order influence survey answer ) manner receive response ( example , measurement body reaction , could interpret survey taker personal judgement ) . This process accompany guarantee survey participant benefit anonymity confidentiality statement . On one hand , certain characteristic person could make possible identify remain secret ( example , mail address telephone number ) modify ( example , person 's first last name ) , event statement hear read person researcher . On hand , researcher agrees transmit record transcript interview person without agreement survey person . These two commitment promote build trust relationship survey participant . They contribute obtain trust , particularly sensitive topic , intimacy , feeling sexuality . They also help `` free '' speech certain person , might fear negative consequence event disclosure statement related identity . Before interview , survey person must give write consent interview record . The duration storage record establish study director . Each record subject retranscription . This process facilitate analyse interview . To conduct interview face-to-face , researcher use interview guide , i.e . series question create beforehand elicit statement survey individual certain aspect existence , appear interest knowledge sought . It plan establish group 20 30 open question . These question group previously define theme , `` relation love one , '' `` domestic activity , '' `` excursion away home , '' test term pertinence first interview , call `` exploratory '' . For answer main question , follow-up question , i.e . series question make possible refine deepen response person survey . At end interview , researcher use `` heel '' , correspond set question efficiently summarise social origin , history current situation person interview family . This process provide valuable information explore global manner role certain factor ( sociocultural background ) way live hemiparesis . The person survey solicit interview minimum duration 45 minimum , ideal least one hour , collect great amount information possible . The location interview mainly Raymond-Poincaré hospital , room without anyone present besides researcher person survey ( spouse possibly ) . The interview take place medical consultation . Depending progress research , certain person interview home . This space present several advantage . Indeed , facilitate participation life partner interview ( require travel ) , contribute stimulate person 's memory , help feel `` comfortable '' interview locate familiar space . In end , corpus approximately 40 interview expect , compose individual interview ( person affect hemiparesis ) well couple ' interview , case partner agree available participate study . This volume interview sufficient detect various reason , attitude practice , well global trend among person . As interview complete , certain repetition data begin arise . The definition volume also respond time constraint proper research . 2.2 - Quantitative component Once qualitative component complete , preparation questionnaire do April 2017 , validation study director . The questionnaire create base qualitative survey , include approximately 20 item , distribute several dimension patient ' life . The participant ' response time questionnaire range 8 12 minute , order facilitate insertion professional practice patient hospital visit . The researcher charge completion questionnaire . This perform around consultation patient Raymond-Poincaré hospital , May December 2017 . The first completion record ( write approval survey patient ) order able work possible improvement , particularly term order question understand response option . After ten completion , questionnaire slightly revise modification appear necessary , remain desired volume questionnaire receive , 100 150 .</detailed_description>
