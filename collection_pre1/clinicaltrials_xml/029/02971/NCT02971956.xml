	<detailed_description>This research study Phase II clinical trial . Phase II clinical trial test safety effectiveness investigational drug learn whether drug work treat specific disease . `` Investigational '' mean drug study . The FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve Pembrolizumab participant specific disease approve us . Pembrolizumab , also know KEYTRUDA MK-3475 , approve USA several country treat type disease . The goal research study -Evaluate safety efficacy pembrolizumab participant advance esophageal cancer respond standard treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically confirm , measurable , unresectable adenocarcinoma squamous cell carcinoma esophagus . For purpose study , undifferentiated carcinoma adenosquamous carcinoma categorize adenocarcinomas . The primary tumor must originate esophagus . Tumors involve GE junction must meet Sievert Type 1 criterion : `` Adenocarcinoma distal oesophagus usually arise area specialize intestinal metaplasia oesophagus ( i.e . Barrett 's oesophagus ) may infiltrate oesophagogastric junction . '' For purpose protocol , interpret : great 50 % tumor must GE junction , alternatively , tumor must involve GE junction arise set biopsydocumented Barrett 's esophagus ( specialized intestinal metaplasia ) . Patients must receive least one prior therapy unresectable disease . Patients recurrence within 6 month completion neoadjuvant adjuvant therapy may consider receive one prior therapy unresectable disease . Be willing able provide write informed consent/assent trial . Be ≥ 18 year age day sign informed consent . Have measurable disease base irRECIST . Be willing provide tissue newly obtain biopsy tumor lesion , commonly EGD biopsy esophagus . Newlyobtained defined specimen obtain 6 week ( 42 day ) prior initiation treatment Day 1 . Subjects newlyobtained sample provide ( e.g . inaccessible subject safety concern ) may submit archived specimen upon agreement Sponsor . Please note , patient may initiate therapy biopsy specimen receive DanaFarber Cancer Institute . The first 15 patient adenocarcinoma offer optional tumor biopsy ( typically EGD biopsy ) 8 week . Starting adenocarcinoma patient # 16 , patient must accessible tumor must agree tumor biopsy 8 week ; continue mandatory total 20 patient undergone biopsy 8 week . Have performance status 0 1 ECOG Performance Scale ( Appendix A ) . Female subject childbearing potential must negative urine serum pregnancy within 72 hour prior receive first dose study medication . If urine test positive confirm negative , serum pregnancy test require . Female subject childbearing potential must willing use 2 method birth control surgically sterile , abstain heterosexual activity course study 120 day last dose study medication ( Reference Section 6.3.2 ) . Subjects childbearing potential surgically sterilize free menses &gt; 1 year . Male subject must agree use adequate method contraception start first dose study therapy 120 day last dose study therapy . Demonstrate adequate organ function define , screen lab perform within 10 day treatment initiation . Hematological Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥1,500 /mcL Platelets ≥80,000 / mcL Hemoglobin ≥8.5 g/dL ≥5.6 mmol/L Renal Serum creatinine ≤1.5 X upper limit normal ( ULN ) OR Measured creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min subject creatinine level &gt; 1.5 X institutional ULN ( GFR also use place creatinine CrCL ) Creatinine clearance calculate per institutional standard . Hepatic Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X ULN OR Direct bilirubin ≤ ULN subject total bilirubin level &gt; 1.5 ULN AST ( SGOT ) ≤ 2.5 X ULN OR ≤ 5 X ULN subject liver metastasis ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 X ULN OR ≤ 5 X ULN subject liver metastasis Albumin &gt; 2.8 mg/dL Coagulation International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) OR Prothrombin Time ( PT ) ≤1.5 X ULN unless subject receive anticoagulant therapy long PT PTT within therapeutic range intend use anticoagulant Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time ( aPTT ) ≤1.5 X ULN unless subject receive anticoagulant therapy long PT PTT within therapeutic range intend use anticoagulant Has diagnosis immunodeficiency receive systemic steroid therapy form immunosuppressive therapy within 7 day prior first dose trial treatment . Subjects require systemic steroid exclude trial . The use physiologic dos corticosteroid may approve discussion sponsor . Has know history active TB ( Bacillus Tuberculosis ) Hypersensitivity pembrolizumab excipients . Has prior anticancer monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) within 4 week prior study Day 1 recover ( i.e. , ≤ Grade 1 baseline ) adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Has prior chemotherapy , target small molecule therapy , radiation therapy within 2 week prior study Day 1 recover ( i.e. , ≤ Grade 1 baseline ) adverse event due previously administer agent . Note : Subjects ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy alopecia exception criterion may qualify study . Note : If subject receive major surgery , must wait ≥ 3 week prior start study treatment . They must recover adequately toxicity and/or complication intervention prior start therapy . Has know additional malignancy progress require active treatment . Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma skin squamous cell carcinoma skin undergone potentially curative therapy situ cervical cancer . Has know active central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis . Subjects previously treat brain metastasis may participate provide stable ( without evidence progression image least four week prior first dose trial treatment neurologic symptom return baseline ) , evidence new enlarge brain metastasis , use steroid least 7 day prior trial treatment . This exception include carcinomatous meningitis exclude regardless clinical stability . Has active autoimmune disease require systemic treatment past 2 year ( i.e . use disease modify agent , corticosteroid immunosuppressive drug ) . Replacement therapy ( eg. , thyroxine , insulin , physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy adrenal pituitary insufficiency , etc . ) consider form systemic treatment . Has active infection require systemic therapy . Patients require supplemental oxygen exclude . Has history current evidence condition , therapy , laboratory abnormality might confound result trial , interfere subject 's participation full duration trial , best interest subject participate , opinion treat investigator . Has know psychiatric substance abuse disorder would interfere cooperation requirement trial . Is pregnant breastfeeding , expect conceive father child within project duration trial , start prescreening screen visit 120 day last dose trial treatment . Has receive prior therapy antiPD1 , antiPDL1 , antiPDL2 agent . Has know history Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) ( HIV 1/2 antibody ) . Has know active Hepatitis B ( e.g. , HBsAg reactive ) Hepatitis C ( e.g. , HCV RNA [ qualitative ] detect ) . Has receive live vaccine within 30 day plan start study therapy . Note : Seasonal influenza vaccine injection generally inactivate flu vaccine allow ; however intranasal influenza vaccine ( e.g. , FluMist® ) live attenuate vaccine , allow . Has history ( noninfectious ) pneumonitis require steroid current pneumonitis .</criteria>
