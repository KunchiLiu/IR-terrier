	<detailed_description>Prostate cancer ( PCa ) remain one commonly diagnose malignancy men worldwide . Early diagnosis definitive therapy seem improve oncological outcome men high-risk disease , significant concern exist term overdiagnosis overtreatment patient lower-risk tumor . In context , active surveillance ( AS ) recently emerge alternative treatment strategy PCa patient low risk cancer . However , publish data base Western population different protocol , therefore ; well-controlled data well-organized prospective cohort urgently need Korean patient low-risk PCa Korean patient significantly different tumor characteristic compare Western patient .
