	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab Enobosarm Treating Patients With Androgen Receptor Positive Metastatic Triple Negative Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety/tolerability combination regimen . II . To determine response rate ( complete response [ CR ] partial response [ PR ] via Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors [ RECIST ] 1.1 ) combination pembrolizumab enobosarm ( GTx-024 ) patient advance androgen receptor ( AR ) triple negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate clinical outcome RECIST 1.1 include clinical benefit rate ( CBR ) 24 week , progression free-survival ( PFS ) , duration response ( DOR ) , event free survival ( EFS ) , time-to-treatment failure ( TTF ) ; overall survival ( OS ) . II . To evaluate role immune-related response criterion ( irRECIST ) . III . To evaluate association AR immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) clinical response . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate association AR gene expression signature clinical response . II . To evaluate effect combination therapy peripheral blood circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) circulate tumor deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) ( ctDNA ) . III . To evaluate pre-treatment programmed death ligand 1 ( PD-L1 ) tumor infiltrate lymphocyte ( TILs ) predictor response combination therapy . IV . To evaluate specific TIL subset ( e.g . CD4 , CD8 , regulatory T cell [ Treg ] distribution ) immunological correlative ( e.g . T cell receptor [ TCR ] repertoire analysis ) possible predictor response . V. To evaluate change TILs result combination therapy . VI . To evaluate peripheral blood , immune biomarkers . OUTLINE : Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 enobosarm orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 35 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 90 day , every 3 month , bi-annually .</detailed_description>
