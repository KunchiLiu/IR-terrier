	<brief_title>Cobalt Alloy Pedicle Screw Implantation Severe Kyphosis Deformity Spinal Tuberculosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>History current related study The incidence spinal tuberculosis continually increase recent year ; disease commonly occur lumbar spine , lumbar vertebra , thoracic vertebra , cervical vertebra . The majority spinal tuberculosis patient present kyphosis deformity correspond segment . In spinal tuberculosis patient severe kyphotic deformity , key successful treatment individual patient 's response tuberculosis drug implementation rational fixation approach appropriate time ; good curative effect show use anterior posterior fixation , follow posterior debridement bone graft fusion . Surgery via posterior anterior approach respectively perform 16 32 patient tuberculosis lumbar spine . The spinal cord function 32 patient assessed Frankel grade C ( n = 7 ) , D ( n = 14 ) E ( n = 11 ) . The primary outcome measure study Cobb angle thoracic spine segment preoperatively versus 2 year postoperatively , use evaluate postoperative change thoracic spine curvature . The primary cause poor heal recurrence spinal tuberculosis thoracic lumbar segment reportedly improper surgical timing , poor debridement , improper selection internal fixation method , poor selection bone graft material graft position , irregular anti-tuberculosis bacillus chemotherapy , drug tolerance , poor braking , use brace surgery . However , factor influence curative effect require investigation . Pedicle screw commonly use repair spine fracture , therefore good biocompatibility . Cobalt alloy reportedly exhibits good anti-bending anti-compressive strength , strong impact toughness , good elastic modulus , small thermal expansion coefficient , good compatibility human body . However , study investigate use cobalt alloy pedicle screw treatment severe kyphosis deformity spinal tuberculosis . Adverse event The investigator record adverse event , include vertebral body displacement , thoracic lumbar back muscle injury , nonspecific low back pain , screw pull loosening . If severe adverse event occur , investigator report detail , include data occurrence measure take treat adverse event , principle investigator institutional review board within 24 hour . Data collection , management , analysis open-access Data collection : Case report form demographic data , disease diagnosis , accompany disease , drug allergy history , adverse event collect , process use Epidata software ( Epidata Association , Odense , Denmark ) , collate , record electronically data manager use double-data entry strategy . Data management : The locked electronic database accessible lock project manager , alter . All data regard trial preserve Affiliated Hospital Hebei University , China . Data analysis : The electronic database statistically analyze professional statistician create outcome analysis report submit lead researcher . An independent data monitoring committee supervise mange trial data , ensure scientific stringent trial yield accurate complete data . Data open access : Anonymized trial data publish www.figshare.com . Statistical analysis Statistical analysis perform use SPSS 19.0 software , follow intention-to-treat principle . Normally distributed measurement data express mean ± standard deviation , minimum maximum . Non-normally distributed measurement data express low quartile ( q1 ) , median upper quartile ( q3 ) . The Wilcoxon match pair test perform comparison Cobb angle preoperatively versus 2 year postoperatively . The Wilcoxon signed-rank test perform comparison pre- post-operative Frankel grade , McNemar 's chi-squared test use analyze incidence adverse reaction . Multiple logistic regression analysis perform analyze factor influence curative effect , calculation regression coefficient , odd ratio 95 % confidence interval . The significance level α = 0.05 .</detailed_description>
