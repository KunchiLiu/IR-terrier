	<detailed_description>This study design understand value shade development skin cancer prevention test prediction social ecologic model health behavior result interplay among built environment , social environment , set feature . Use shade recommend health authority worldwide . However , shade provision require expensive physical environment change may effective health education create social environment ( e.g. , norm ) motivates use . A multi-national research team explore use build shade passive recreation area ( i.e. , area sitting/ stand socializing , preparing/eating meal , watching/coaching sport , watch concert , take class , wait , area people stroll sightsee , observe outdoor display , shop ) within public park compare use United States ( i.e. , Denver , Colorado ) Australia ( i.e. , Melbourne , Victoria ) prospectively test moderate influence social environment build environment . Pilot study confirm adult Melbourne strong sun protection habit norm adult Denver . The specific aim project : ) introduce build shade structure ( i.e. , shade sail ) public park Denver Melbourne ; b ) compare use passive recreation area without build shade ; c ) compare change use passive recreation area Denver Melbourne introduction build shade , ) examine relationship among social environment physical feature environment build shade.The research team build shade sail passive recreation area public park compare use passive recreation area unshaded passive recreation area randomize pretest-posttest controlled design . Passive recreation area enrol one three annual sample wave stratify location ( 72 Denver 72 Melbourne ) . In wave , passive recreation area pretested first summer , stratify base baseline use , randomize follow pretest construction shade sail untreated control group 1:3 ratio . Posttesting occur follow summer , construction shade sail . In total , 36 passive recreation area randomize intervention group shade sail construction ( 18 per city ) 108 passive recreation area untreated control group shade sail ( 54 per city ) . The primary outcome measure use passive recreation area , observe trained research assistant . The secondary outcome measure potential ultraviolet radiation exposure , assess hand-held meter observation passive recreation area . Data collection occur 30-minute period 11 3 pm 4 weekend day 20-weeks summer . Primary analysis perform probability passive recreation area use observed secondary analysis , estimate standard erythemal dose ultraviolet radiation 30 minute , use intent-to-treat method .</detailed_description>
