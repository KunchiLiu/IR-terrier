	<brief_title>Low-dose Protocol Computed Tomography-guided Lung Biopsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With comprehensive usage compute tomography examination , patient aware radiation dose compute tomography . Concerns potential radiation induce malignancy increasingly publish scientific literature report popular press . The risk high young patient , radiation-sensitive tissue longer life expectancy adult . Recently , United States Food Drug Administration announce initiative reduce unnecessary radiation exposure medical imaging . At present , low-dose compute tomography protocol widely use diagnosis cardiovascular cerebrovascular disease . Computed tomography-guided lung biopsy widely use diagnosis lung nodule mass . However , require repeat scan guide needle , inevitably increase radiation dose . Therefore , low-dose protocol also use compute tomography-guided lung biopsy procedure . The purpose study compare diagnostic accuracy complication rate low-dose compute tomography-guided standard-dose compute tomography-guided lung biopsy .</detailed_description>
